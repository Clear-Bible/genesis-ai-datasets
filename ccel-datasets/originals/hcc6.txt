   PREFACE

   This volume completes the history of the Church in the Middle Ages. Dr.
   Philip Schaff on one occasion spoke of the Middle Ages as a terra
   incognita in the United States,--a territory not adequately explored.
   These words would no longer be applicable, whether we have in mind the
   instruction given in our universities or theological seminaries. In
   Germany, during the last twenty years, the study of the period has been
   greatly developed, and no period at the present time, except the
   Apostolic age, attracts more scholarly and earnest attention and
   research.

   The author has had no apologetic concern to contradict the old notion,
   perhaps still somewhat current in our Protestant circles, that the
   Middle Ages were a period of superstition and worthy of study as a
   curiosity rather than as a time directed and overruled by an all-seeing
   Providence. He has attempted to depict it as it was and to allow the
   picture of high religious purpose to reveal itself side by side with
   the picture of hierarchical assumption and scholastic
   misinterpretation. Without the mediaeval age, the Reformation would not
   have been possible. Nor is this statement to be understood in the sense
   in which we speak of reaching a land of sunshine and plenty after
   having traversed a desert. We do well to give to St. Bernard and
   Francis d'Assisi, St. Elizabeth and St. Catherine of Siena, Gerson,
   Tauler and Nicolas of Cusa a high place in our list of religious
   personalities, and to pray for men to speak to our generation as well
   as they spoke to the generations in which they lived.

   Moreover, the author has been actuated by no purpose to disparage
   Christians who, in the alleged errors of Protestantism, find an
   insuperable barrier to Christian fellowship. Where he has passed
   condemnatory judgments on personalities, as on the popes of the last
   years of the 15th and the earlier years of the 16th century, it is not
   because they occupied the papal throne, but because they were
   personalities who in any walk of life would call for the severest
   reprobation. The unity of the Christian faith and the promotion of
   fellowship between Christians of all names and all ages are
   considerations which should make us careful with pen or spoken word
   lest we condemn, without properly taking into consideration that
   interior devotion to Christ and His kingdom -which seems to be quite
   compatible with divergencies in doctrinal statement or ceremonial
   habit.

   On the pages of the volume, the author has expressed his indebtedness
   to the works of the eminent mediaeval historians and investigators of
   the day, Gregorovius, Pastor, Mandell Creighton, Lea, Ehrle, Denifle,
   Finke, Schwab, Haller, Carl Mirbt, R. Mueller Kirsch, Loserth, Janssen,
   Valois, Burckhardt-Geiger, Seebohm and others, Protestant and Roman
   Catholic, and some no more among the living.

   It is a pleasure to be able again to express his indebtedness to the
   Rev. David E. Culley, his colleague in the Western Theological
   Seminary, whose studies in mediaeval history and accurate scholarship
   have been given to the volume in the reading of the manuscript, before
   it went to the printer, and of the printed pages before they received
   their final form.

   Above all, the author feels it to be a great privilege that he has been
   able to realize the hope which Dr. Philip Schaff expressed in the last
   years of his life, that his History of the Christian Church which, in
   four volumes, had traversed the first ten centuries and, in the sixth
   and seventh, set forth the progress of the German and Swiss
   Reformations, might be carried through the fruitful period from
   1050-1517.

   § 1. Introductory Survey.

   The two centuries intervening between 1294 and 1517, between the
   accession of Boniface VIII. and the nailing of Luther's Ninety-five
   Theses against the church door in Wittenberg, mark the gradual
   transition from the Middle Ages to modern times, from the universal
   acceptance of the papal theocracy in Western Europe to the assertion of
   national independence, from the supreme authority of the priesthood to
   the intellectual and spiritual freedom of the individual. Old things
   are passing away; signs of a new order increase. Institutions are seen
   to be breaking up. The scholastic systems of theology lose their
   compulsive hold on men's minds, and even become the subject of
   ridicule. The abuses of the earlier Middle Ages call forth voices
   demanding reform on the basis of the Scriptures and the common
   well-being of mankind. The inherent vital energies in the Church seek
   expression in new forms of piety and charitable deed.

   The power of the papacy, which had asserted infallibility of judgment
   and dominion over all departments of human life, was undermined by the
   mistakes, pretensions, and worldliness of the papacy itself, as
   exhibited in the policy of Boniface VIII., the removal of the papal
   residence to Avignon, and the disastrous schism which, for nearly half
   a century, gave to Europe the spectacle of two, and at times three,
   popes reigning at the same time and all professing to be the
   vicegerents of God on earth.

   The free spirit of nationality awakened during the crusades grew strong
   and successfully resisted the papal authority, first in France and then
   in other parts of Europe. Princes asserted supreme authority over the
   citizens within their dominions and insisted upon the obligations of
   churches to the state. The leadership of Europe passed from Germany to
   France, with England coming more and more into prominence.

   The tractarian literature of the fourteenth century set forth the
   rights of man and the principles of common law in opposition to the
   pretensions of the papacy and the dogmatism of the scholastic systems.
   Lay writers made themselves heard as pioneers of thought, and a
   practical outlook upon the mission of the Church was cultivated. With
   unexampled audacity Dante assailed the lives of popes, putting some of
   St. Peter's successors into the lowest rooms of hell.

   The Reformatory councils of Pisa, Constance, and Basel turned Europe
   for nearly fifty years, 1409-1450, into a platform of ecclesiastical
   and religious discussion. Though they failed to provide a remedy for
   the disorders prevailing in the Church, they set an example of free
   debate, and gave the weight of their eminent constituency to the
   principle that not in a select group of hierarchs does supreme
   authority in the Church rest, but in the body of the Church.

   The hopelessness of expecting any permanent reform from the papacy and
   the hierarchy was demonstrated in the last years of the period,
   1460-1517, when ecclesiastical Rome offered a spectacle of moral
   corruption and spiritual fall which has been compared to the corrupt
   age of the Roman Empire.

   The religious unrest and the passion for a better state of affairs
   found expression in Wyclif, Huss, and other leaders who, by their clear
   apprehension of truth and readiness to stand by their public
   utterances, even unto death, stood far above their own age and have
   shone in all the ages since.

   While coarse ambition and nepotism, a total perversion of the
   ecclesiastical office and violation of the fundamental virtues of the
   Christian life held rule in the highest place of Christendom, a pure
   stream of piety was flowing in the Church of the North, and the mystics
   along the Rhine and in the Lowlands were unconsciously fertilizing the
   soil from which the Reformation was to spring forth.

   The Renaissance, or the revival of classical culture, unshackled the
   minds of men. The classical works of antiquity were once more, after
   the churchly disparagement of a thousand years, held forth to
   admiration. The confines of geography were extended by the discoveries
   of the continent in the West.

   The invention of the art of printing, about 1440, forms an epoch in
   human advancement, and made it possible for the products of human
   thought to be circulated widely among the people, and thus to train the
   different nations for the new age of religious enfranchisement about to
   come, and the sovereignty of the intellect.

   To this generation, which looks back over the last four centuries, the
   discovery of America and the pathways to the Indies was one of the
   remarkable events in history, a surprise and a prophecy. In 1453,
   Constantinople easily passed into the hands of the Turk, and the
   Christian empire of the East fell apart. In the far West the beginnings
   of a new empire were made, just as the Middle Ages were drawing to a
   close.

   At the same time, at the very close of the period, under the direction
   and protection of the Church, an institution was being prosecuted which
   has scarcely been equalled in the history of human cruelty, the
   Inquisition,--now papal, now Spanish,--which punished heretics unto
   death in Spain and witches in Germany.

   Thus European society was shaking itself clear of long-established
   customs and dogmas based upon the infallibility of the Church visible,
   and at the same time it held fast to some of the most noxious beliefs
   and practices the Church had allowed herself to accept and propagate.
   It had not the original genius or the conviction to produce a new
   system of theology. The great Schoolmen continued to rule doctrinal
   thought. It established no new ecclesiastical institution of an abiding
   character like the canon law. It exhibited no consuming passion such as
   went out in the preceding period in the crusades and the activity of
   the Mendicant Orders. It had no transcendent ecclesiastical characters
   like St. Bernard and Innocent III. The last period of the Middle Ages
   was a period of intellectual discontent, of self-introspection, a
   period of intimation and of preparation for an order which it was
   itself not capable of begetting.

   § 3. Pope Boniface VIII. 1294-1303.

   The pious but weak and incapable hermit of Murrhone, Coelestine V., who
   abdicated the papal office, was followed by Benedict Gaetani,--or
   Cajetan, the name of an ancient family of Latin counts,--known in
   history as Boniface VIII. At the time of his election he was on the
   verge of fourscore, [2] but like Gregory IX. he was still in the full
   vigor of a strong intellect and will. If Coelestine had the reputation
   of a saint, Boniface was a politician, overbearing, implacable,
   destitute of spiritual ideals, and controlled by blind and insatiable
   lust of power.

   Born at Anagni, Boniface probably studied canon law, in which he was an
   expert, in Rome. [3] He was made cardinal in 1281, and represented the
   papal see in France and England as legate. In an address at a council
   in Paris, assembled to arrange for a new crusade, he reminded the
   mendicant monks that he and they were called not to court glory or
   learning, but to secure the salvation of their souls. [4]

   Boniface's election as pope occurred at Castel Nuovo, near Naples, Dec.
   24, 1294, the conclave having convened the day before. The election was
   not popular, and a few days later, when a report reached Naples that
   Boniface was dead, the people celebrated the event with great
   jubilation. The pontiff was accompanied on his way to Rome by Charles
   II. of Naples. [5]

   The coronation was celebrated amid festivities of unusual splendor. On
   his way to the Lateran, Boniface rode on a white palfrey, a crown on
   his head, and robed in full pontificals. Two sovereigns walked by his
   side, the kings of Naples and Hungary. The Orsini, the Colonna, the
   Savelli, the Conti and representatives of other noble Roman families
   followed in a body . The procession had difficulty in forcing its way
   through the kneeling crowds of spectators. But, as if an omen of the
   coming misfortunes of the new pope, a furious storm burst over the city
   while the solemnities were in progress and extinguished every lamp and
   torch in the church. The following day the pope dined in the Lateran,
   the two kings waiting behind his chair.

   While these brilliant ceremonies were going on, Peter of Murrhone was a
   fugitive. Not willing to risk the possible rivalry of an anti-pope,
   Boniface confined his unfortunate predecessor in prison, where he soon
   died. The cause of his death was a matter of uncertainty. The
   Coelestine party ascribed it to Boniface, and exhibited a nail which
   they declared the unscrupulous pope had ordered driven into
   Coelestine's head.

   With Boniface VIII. began the decline of the papacy. He found it at the
   height of its power. He died leaving it humbled and in subjection to
   France. He sought to rule in the proud, dominating spirit of Gregory
   VII. and Innocent III.; but he was arrogant without being strong, bold
   without being sagacious, high-spirited without possessing the wisdom to
   discern the signs of the times. [6] The times had changed. Boniface
   made no allowance for the new spirit of nationality which had been
   developed during the crusading campaigns in the East, and which entered
   into conflict with the old theocratic ideal of Rome. France, now in
   possession of the remaining lands of the counts of Toulouse, was in no
   mood to listen to the dictation of the power across the Alps. Striving
   to maintain the fictitious theory of papal rights, and fighting against
   the spirit of the new age, Boniface lost the prestige the Apostolic See
   had enjoyed for two centuries, and died of mortification over the
   indignities heaped upon him by France.

   French enemies went so far as to charge Boniface with downright
   infidelity and the denial of the soul's immortality. The charges were a
   slander, but they show the reduced confidence which the papal office
   inspired. Dante, who visited Rome during Boniface's pontificate,
   bitterly pursues him in all parts of the Divina Commedia. He pronounced
   him "the prince of modern Pharisees," a usurper "who turned the Vatican
   hill into a common sewer of corruption." The poet assigned the pope a
   place with Nicholas III. and Clement V. among the simoniacs in "that
   most afflicted shade," one of the lowest circles of hell. [7] Its floor
   was perforated with holes into which the heads of these popes were
   thrust.


   "The soles of every one in flames were wrapt -- [8]

   ... whose upper parts are thrust below

   Fixt like a stake, most wretched soul

   * * * * * * * * *

   Quivering in air his tortured feet were seen."

   Contemporaries comprehended Boniface's reign in the description, "He
   came in like a fox, he reigned like a lion, and he died like a dog,
   intravit ut vulpes, regnavit ut leo, mortuus est sicut canis.

   In his attempt to control the affairs of European states, he met with
   less success than failure, and in Philip the Fair of France he found
   his match.

   In Sicily, he failed to carry out his plans to secure the transfer of
   the realm from the house of Aragon to the king of Naples.

   In Rome, he incurred the bitter enmity of the proud and powerful family
   of the Colonna, by attempting to dictate the disposition of the family
   estates. Two of the Colonna, James and Peter, who were cardinals, had
   been friends of Coelestine, and supporters of that pope gathered around
   them. Of their number was Jacopone da Todi, the author of the Stabat
   Mater, who wrote a number of satirical pieces against Boniface.
   Resenting the pope's interference in their private matters, the Colonna
   issued a memorial, pronouncing Coelestine's abdication and the election
   of Boniface illegal. [9] It exposed the haughtiness of Boniface, and
   represented him as boasting that he was supreme over kings and
   kingdoms, even in temporal affairs, and that he was governed by no law
   other than his own will. [10] The document was placarded on the
   churches and a copy left in St. Peter's. In 1297 Boniface deprived the
   Colonna of their dignity, excommunicated them, and proclaimed a crusade
   against them. The two cardinals appealed to a general council, the
   resort in the next centuries of so many who found themselves out of
   accord with the papal plans. Their strongholds fell one after another.
   The last of them, Palestrina, had a melancholy fate. The two cardinals
   with ropes around their necks threw themselves at the pope's feet and
   secured his pardon, but their estates were confiscated and bestowed
   upon the pope's nephews and the Orsini. The Colonna family recovered in
   time to reap a bitter vengeance upon their insatiable enemy.

   The German emperor, Albrecht, Boniface succeeded in bringing to an
   abject submission. The German envoys were received by the haughty
   pontiff seated on a throne with a crown upon his head and sword in his
   hand, and exclaiming, "I, I am the emperor." Albrecht accepted his
   crown as a gift, and acknowledged that the empire had been transferred
   from the Greeks to the Germans by the pope, and that the electors owed
   the right of election to the Apostolic See.

   In England, Boniface met with sharp resistance. Edward I., 1272-1307,
   was on the throne. The pope attempted to prevent him from holding the
   crown of Scotland, claiming it as a papal fief from remote antiquity.
   [11] The English parliament, 1301, gave a prompt and spirited reply.
   The English king was under no obligation to the papal see for his
   temporal acts. [12] The dispute went no further. The conflict between
   Boniface and France is reserved for more prolonged treatment.

   An important and picturesque event of Boniface's pontificate was the
   Jubilee Year, celebrated in 1300. It was a fortunate conception,
   adapted to attract throngs of pilgrims to Rome and fill the papal
   treasury. An old man of 107 years of age, so the story ran, travelled
   from Savoy to Rome, and told how his father had taken him to attend a
   Jubilee in the year 1200 and exhorted him to visit it on its recurrence
   a century after. Interesting as the story is, the Jubilee celebration
   of 1300 seems to have been the first of its kind. [13] Boniface's bull,
   appointing it, promised full remission to all, being penitent and
   confessing their sins, who should visit St. Peter's during the year
   1300. [14] Italians were to prolong their sojourn 30 days, while for
   foreigners 15 days were announced to be sufficient. A subsequent papal
   deliverance extended the benefits of the indulgence to all setting out
   for the Holy City who died on the way. The only exceptions made to
   these gracious provisions were the Colonna, Frederick of Sicily, and
   the Christians holding traffic with Saracens. The city wore a festal
   appearance. The handkerchief of St. Veronica, bearing the imprint of
   the Saviour's face, was exhibited. The throngs fairly trampled upon one
   another. The contemporary historian of Florence, Giovanni Villani,
   testifies from personal observation that there was a constant
   population in the pontifical city of 200,000 pilgrims, and that 30,000
   people reached and left it daily. The offerings were so copious that
   two clerics stood day and night by the altar of St. Peter's gathering
   up the coins with rakes.

   So spectacular and profitable a celebration could not be allowed to
   remain a memory. The Jubilee was made a permanent institution. A second
   celebration was appointed by Clement VI. in 1350. With reference to the
   brevity of human life and also to the period of our Lord's earthly
   career, Urban VI. fixed its recurrence every 33 years. Paul II., in
   1470, reduced the intervals to 25 years. The twentieth Jubilee was
   celebrated in 1900, under Leo XIII. [15] Leo extended the offered
   benefits to those who had the will and not the ability to make the
   journey to Rome.

   For the offerings accruing from the Jubilee and for other papal moneys,
   Boniface found easy use. They enabled him to prosecute his wars against
   Sicily and the Colonna and to enrich his relatives. The chief object of
   his favor was his nephew, Peter, the second son of his brother Loffred,
   the Count of Caserta. One estate after another was added to this
   favorite's possessions, and the vast sum of more than 915,000,000 was
   spent upon him in four years. [16] Nepotism was one of the offences for
   which Boniface was arraigned by his contemporaries.

   § 4. Boniface VIII. and Philip the Fair of France.

   The overshadowing event of Boniface's reign was his disastrous conflict
   with Philip IV. of France, called Philip the Fair. The grandson of
   Louis IX., this monarch was wholly wanting in the high spiritual
   qualities which had distinguished his ancestor. He was able but
   treacherous, and utterly unscrupulous in the use of means to secure his
   ends. Unattractive as his character is, it is nevertheless with him
   that the first chapter in the history of modern France begins. In his
   conflict with Boniface he gained a decisive victory. On a smaller scale
   the conflict was a repetition of the conflict between Gregory VII. and
   Henry IV., but with a different ending. In both cases the pope had
   reached a venerable age, while the sovereign was young and wholly
   governed by selfish motives. Henry resorted to the election of an
   anti-pope. Philip depended upon his councillors and the spirit of the
   new French nation.

   The heir of the theocracy of Hildebrand repeated Hildebrand's language
   without possessing his moral qualities. He claimed for the papacy
   supreme authority in temporal as well as spiritual matters. In his
   address to the cardinals against the Colonna he exclaimed: "How shall
   we assume to judge kings and princes, and not dare to proceed against a
   worm! Let them perish forever, that they may understand that the name
   of the Roman pontiff is known in all the earth and that he alone is
   most high over princes." [17] The Colonna, in one of their
   proclamations, charged Boniface with glorying that he is exalted above
   all princes and kingdoms in temporal matters, and may act as he pleases
   in view of the fulness of his power--plenitudo potestatis. In his
   official recognition of the emperor, Albrecht, Boniface declared that
   as "the moon has no light except as she receives it from the sun, so no
   earthly power has anything which it does not receive from the
   ecclesiastical authority." These claims are asserted with most
   pretension in the bulls Boniface issued during his conflict with
   France. Members of the papal court encouraged him in these haughty
   assertions of prerogative. The Spaniard, Arnald of Villanova, who
   served Boniface as physician, called him in his writings lord of
   lords--deus deorum.

   On the other hand, Philip the Fair stood as the embodiment of the
   independence of the state. He had behind him a unified nation, and
   around him a body of able statesmen and publicists who defended his
   views. [18]

   The conflict between Boniface and Philip passed through three stages:
   (1) the brief tilt which called forth the bull Clericis laicos; (2) the
   decisive battle, 1301-1303, ending in Boniface's humiliation at Anagni;
   (3) the bitter controversy which was waged against the pope's memory by
   Philip, ending with the Council of Vienne. [19]

   The conflict originated in questions touching the war between France
   and England. To meet the expense of his armament against Edward I.,
   Philip levied tribute upon the French clergy. They carried their
   complaints to Rome, and Boniface justified their contention in the bull
   Clericis laicos, 1296. This document was ordered promulged in England
   as well as in France. Robert of Winchelsea, archbishop of Canterbury,
   had it read in all the English cathedral churches. Its opening sentence
   impudently asserted that the laity had always been hostile to the
   clergy. The document went on to affirm the subjection of the state to
   the papal see. Jurisdiction over the persons of the priesthood and the
   goods of the Church in no wise belongs to the temporal power. The
   Church may make gratuitous gifts to the state, but all taxation of
   Church property without the pope's consent is to be resisted with
   excommunication or interdict.

   Imposts upon the Church for special emergencies had been a subject of
   legislation at the third and fourth Lateran Councils. In 1260 Alexander
   IV. exempted the clergy from special taxation, and in 1291 Nicolas IV.
   warned the king of France against using for his own schemes the tenth
   levied for a crusade. Boniface had precedent enough for his utterances.
   But his bull was promptly met by Philip with an act of reprisal
   prohibiting the export of silver and gold, horses, arms, and other
   articles from his realm, and forbidding foreigners to reside in France.
   This shrewd measure cut off French contributions to the papal treasury
   and cleared France of the pope's emissaries. Boniface was forced to
   reconsider his position, and in conciliatory letters, addressed to the
   king and the French prelates, pronounced the interpretation put upon
   his deliverance unjust. Its purpose was not to deny feudal and freewill
   offerings from the Church. In cases of emergency, the pope would also
   be ready to grant special subsidies. The document was so offensive that
   the French bishops begged the pope to recall it altogether, a request
   he set aside. But to appease Philip, Boniface issued another bull, July
   22, 1297, according thereafter to French kings, who had reached the age
   of 20, the right to judge whether a tribute from the clergy was a case
   of necessity or not. A month later he canonized Louis IX., a further
   act of conciliation.

   Boniface also offered to act as umpire between France and England in
   his personal capacity as Benedict Gaetanus. The offer was accepted, but
   the decision was not agreeable to the French sovereign. The pope
   expressed a desire to visit Philip, but again gave offence by asking
   Philip for a loan of 100, 000 pounds for Philip's brother, Charles of
   Valois, whom Boniface had invested with the command of the papal
   forces.

   In 1301 the flame of controversy was again started by a document,
   written probably by the French advocate, Pierre Dubois, [20] which
   showed the direction in which Philip's mind was working, for it could
   hardly have appeared without his assent. The writer summoned the king
   to extend his dominions to the walls of Rome and beyond, and denied the
   pope's right to secular power. The pontiff's business is confined to
   the forgiving of sins, prayer, and preaching. Philip continued to lay
   his hand without scruple on Church property; Lyons, which had been
   claimed by the empire, he demanded as a part of France. Appeals against
   his arbitrary acts went to Rome, and the pope sent Bernard of Saisset,
   bishop of Pamiers, to Paris, with commission to summon the French king
   to apply the clerical tithe for its appointed purpose, a crusade, and
   for nothing else. Philip showed his resentment by having the legate
   arrested. He was adjudged by the civil tribunal a traitor, and his
   deposition from the episcopate demanded.

   Boniface's reply, set forth in the bull Ausculta fili -- Give ear, my
   son--issued Dec. 5, 1301, charged the king with high-handed treatment
   of the clergy and making plunder of ecclesiastical property. The pope
   announced a council to be held in Rome to which the French prelates
   were called and the king summoned to be present, either in person or by
   a representative. The bull declared that God had placed his earthly
   vicar above kings and kingdoms. To make the matter worse, a false copy
   of Boniface's bull was circulated in France known as Deum time,--Fear
   God,--which made the statements of papal prerogative still more
   exasperating. This supposititious document, which is supposed to have
   been forged by Pierre Flotte, the king's chief councillor, was thrown
   into the flames Feb. 11, 1302. [21] Such treatment of a papal brief was
   unprecedented. It remained for Luther to cast the genuine bull of Leo
   X. into the fire. The two acts had little in common.

   The king replied by calling a French parliament of the three estates,
   the nobility, clergy and representatives of the cities, which set aside
   the papal summons to the council, complained of the appointment of
   foreigners to French livings, and asserted the crown's independence of
   the Church. Five hundred years later a similar representative body of
   the three estates was to rise against French royalty and decide for the
   abolition of monarchy. In a letter to the pope, Philip addressed him as
   "your infatuated Majesty," [22] and declined all submission to any one
   on earth in temporal matters.

   The council called by the pope convened in Rome the last day of
   October, 1302, and included 4 archbishops, 35 bishops, and 6 abbots
   from France. It issued two bulls. The first pronounced the ban on all
   who detained prelates going to Rome or returning from the city. The
   second is one of the most notable of all papal documents, the bull Unam
   sanctam, the name given to it from its first words, "We are forced to
   believe in one holy Catholic Church." It marks an epoch in the history
   of the declarations of the papacy, not because it contained anything
   novel, but because it set forth with unchanged clearness the stiffest
   claims of the papacy to temporal and spiritual power. It begins with
   the assertion that there is only one true Church, outside of which
   there is no salvation. The pope is the vicar of Christ, and whoever
   refuses to be ruled by Peter belongs not to the fold of Christ. Both
   swords are subject to the Church, the spiritual and the temporal. The
   temporal sword is to be wielded for the Church, the spiritual by it.
   The secular estate may be judged by the spiritual estate, but the
   spiritual estate by no human tribunal. The document closes with the
   startling declaration that for every human being the condition of
   salvation is obedience to the Roman pontiff.

   There was no assertion of authority contained in this bull which had
   not been before made by Gregory VII. and his successors, and the
   document leans back not only upon the deliverances of popes, but upon
   the definitions of theologians like Hugo de St. Victor, Bernard and
   Thomas Aquinas. But in the Unam sanctam the arrogance of the papacy
   finds its most naked and irritating expression.

   One of the clauses pronounces all offering resistance to the pope's
   authority Manichaeans. Thus Philip was made a heretic. Six months later
   the pope sent a cardinal legate, John le Moine of Amiens, to announce
   to the king his excommunication for preventing French bishops from
   going to Rome. The bearer of the message was imprisoned and the legate
   fled. Boniface now called upon the German emperor, Albrecht, to take
   Philip's throne, as Innocent III. had called upon the French king to
   take John's crown, and Innocent IV. upon the count of Artois to take
   the crown of Frederick II. Albrecht had wisdom enough to decline the
   empty gift. Philip's seizure of the papal bulls before they could be
   promulged in France was met by Boniface's announcement that the posting
   of a bull on the church doors of Rome was sufficient to give it force.

   The French parliament, June, 1308, passed from the negative attitude of
   defending the king and French rights to an attack upon Boniface and his
   right to the papal throne. In 20 articles it accused him of simony,
   sorcery, immoral intercourse with his niece, having a demon in his
   chambers, the murder of Coelestine, and other crimes. It appealed to a
   general council, before which the pope was summoned to appear in
   person. Five archbishops and 21 bishops joined in subscribing to this
   document. The university and chapter of Paris, convents, cities, and
   towns placed themselves on the king's side. [23]

   One more step the pope was about to take when a sudden stop was put to
   his career. He had set the eighth day of September as the time when he
   would publicly, in the church of Anagni, and with all the solemnities
   known to the Church, pronounce the ban upon the disobedient king and
   release his subjects from allegiance. In the same edifice Alexander
   III. had excommunicated Barbarossa, and Gregory IX., Frederick II. The
   bull already had the papal signature, when, as by a storm bursting from
   a clear sky, the pope's plans were shattered and his career brought to
   an end.

   During the two centuries and a half since Hildebrand had entered the
   city of Rome with Leo IX., popes had been imprisoned by emperors, been
   banished from Rome by its citizens, had fled for refuge and died in
   exile, but upon no one of them had a calamity fallen quite so
   humiliating and complete as the calamity which now befell Boniface. A
   plot, formed in France to checkmate the pope and to carry him off to a
   council at Lyons, burst Sept. 7 upon the peaceful population of Anagni,
   the pope's country seat. William of Nogaret, professor of law at
   Montpellier and councillor of the king, was the manager of the plot and
   was probably its inventor. According to the chronicler, Villani, [24]
   Nogaret's parents were Cathari, and suffered for heresy in the flames
   in Southern France. He stood as a representative of a new class of men,
   laymen, who were able to compete in culture with the best-trained
   ecclesiastics, and advocated the independence of the state. With him
   was joined Sciarra Colonna, who, with other members of his family, had
   found refuge in France, and was thirsting for revenge for their
   proscription by the pope. With a small body of mercenaries, 300 of them
   on horse, they suddenly appeared in Anagni. The barons of the Latium,
   embittered by the rise of the Gaetani family upon their losses, joined
   with the conspirators, as also did the people of Anagni. The palaces of
   two of Boniface's nephews and several of the cardinals were stormed and
   seized by Sciarra Colonna, who then offered the pope life on the three
   conditions that the Colonna be restored, Boniface resign, and that he
   place himself in the hands of the conspirators. The conditions were
   rejected, and after a delay of three hours, the work of assault and
   destruction was renewed. The palaces one after another yielded, and the
   papal residence itself was taken and entered. The supreme pontiff,
   according to the description of Villani, [25] received the besiegers in
   high pontifical robes, seated on a throne, with a crown on his head and
   a crucifix and the keys in his hand. He proudly rebuked the intruders,
   and declared his readiness to die for Christ and his Church. To the
   demand that he resign the papal office, he replied, "Never; I am pope
   and as pope I will die." Sciarra was about to kill him, when he was
   intercepted by Nogaret's arm. The palaces were looted and the cathedral
   burnt, and its relics, if not destroyed, went to swell the booty. One
   of the relics, a vase said to have contained milk from Mary's breasts,
   was turned over and broken. The pope and his nephews were held in
   confinement for three days, the captors being undecided whether to
   carry Boniface away to Lyons, set him at liberty, or put him to death.
   Such was the humiliating counterpart to the proud display made at the
   pope's coronation nine years before!

   In the meantime the feelings of the Anagnese underwent a change. The
   adherents of the Gaetani family rallied their forces and, combining
   together, they rescued Boniface and drove out the conspirators. Seated
   at the head of his palace stairway, the pontiff thanked God and the
   people for his deliverance. "Yesterday," he said, "I was like Job, poor
   and without a friend. To-day I have abundance of bread, wine, and
   water." A rescuing party from Rome conducted the unfortunate pope to
   the Holy City, where he was no longer his own master. [26] A month
   later, Oct. 11, 1303, his earthly career closed. Outside the
   death-chamber, the streets of the city were filled with riot and
   tumult, and the Gaetani and Colonna were encamped in battle array
   against each other in the Campagna.

   Reports agree that Boniface's death was a most pitiable one. He died of
   melancholy and despair, and perhaps actually insane. He refused food,
   and beat his head against the wall. "He was out of his head," wrote
   Ptolemy of Lucca, [27] and believed that every one who approached him
   was seeking to put him in prison.

   Human sympathy goes out for the aged man of fourscore years and more,
   dying in loneliness and despair. But judgment comes sooner or later
   upon individuals and institutions for their mistakes and offences. The
   humiliation of Boniface was the long-delayed penalty of the sacerdotal
   pride of his predecessors and himself. He suffered in part for the
   hierarchical arrogance of which he was the heir and in part for his own
   presumption. Villani and other contemporaries represent the pope's
   latter end as a deserved punishment for his unblushing nepotism, his
   pompous pride, and his implacable severity towards those who dared to
   resist his plans, and for his treatment of the feeble hermit who
   preceded him. One of the chroniclers reports that seamen plying near
   the Liparian islands, the reputed entrance to hell, heard evil spirits
   rejoicing and exclaiming, "Open, open; receive pope Boniface into the
   infernal regions."

   Catholic historians like Hergenröther and Kirsch, bound to the ideals
   of the past, make a brave attempt to defend Boniface, though they do
   not overlook his want of tact and his coarse violence of speech. It is
   certain, says Cardinal Hergenröther, [28] "that Boniface was not ruled
   by unworthy motives and that he did not deviate from the paths of his
   predecessors or overstep the legal conceptions of the Middle Ages."
   Finke, also a Catholic historian, the latest learned investigator of
   the character and career of Boniface, acknowledges the pope's
   intellectual ability, but also emphasizes his pride and arrogance, his
   depreciation of other men, his disagreeable spirit and manner, which
   left him without a personal friend, his nepotism and his avarice. He
   hoped, said a contemporary, to live till "all his enemies were
   suppressed."

   In strong contrast to the common judgment of Catholic historians is the
   sentence passed by Gregorovius. "Boniface was devoid of every
   apostolical virtue, a man of passionate temper, violent, faithless,
   unscrupulous, unforgiving, filled with ambitions and lust of worldly
   power." And this will be the judgment of those who feel no obligation
   to defend the papal institution.

   In the humiliation of Boniface VIII., the state gained a signal triumph
   over the papacy. The proposition, that the papal pretension to
   supremacy over the temporal power is inconsistent with the rights of
   man and untaught by the law of God, was about to be defended in bold
   writings coming from the pens of lawyers and poets in France and Italy
   and, a half century later, by Wyclif. These advocates of the sovereign
   independence of the state in its own domain were the real descendants
   of those jurisconsults who, on the pIain of Roncaglia, advocated the
   same theory in the hearing of Frederick Barbarossa. Two hundred years
   after the conflict between Boniface and Philip the Fair, Luther was to
   fight the battle for the spiritual sovereignty of the individual man.
   These two principles, set aside by the priestly pride and theological
   misunderstanding of the Middle Ages, belong to the foundation of modern
   civilization.

   Boniface's Bull, Unam Sanctam.

   The great importance of Boniface's bull, Unam Sanctam, issued against
   Philip the Fair, Nov. 18, 1302, justifies its reproduction both in
   translation and the original Latin. It has rank among the most
   notorious deliverances of the popes and is as full of error as was
   Innocent VIII.'s bull issued in 1484 against witchcraft. It presents
   the theory of the supremacy of the spiritual power over the temporal,
   the authority of the papacy over princes, in its extreme form. The
   following is a translation: --

   Boniface, Bishop, Servant of the servants of God. For perpetual
   remembrance: --

   Urged on by our faith, we are obliged to believe and hold that there is
   one holy, catholic, and apostolic Church. And we firmly believe and
   profess that outside of her there is no salvation nor remission of
   sins, as the bridegroom declares in the Canticles, "My dove, my
   undefiled, is but one; she is the only one of her mother; she is the
   choice one of her that bare her." And this represents the one mystical
   body of Christ, and of this body Christ is the head, and God is the
   head of Christ. In it there is one Lord, one faith, one baptism. For in
   the time of the Flood there was the single ark of Noah, which
   prefigures the one Church, and it was finished according to the measure
   of one cubit and had one Noah for pilot and captain, and outside of it
   every living creature on the earth, as we read, was destroyed. And this
   Church we revere as the only one, even as the Lord saith by the
   prophet, "Deliver my soul from the sword, my darling from the power of
   the dog." He prayed for his soul, that is, for himself, head and body.
   And this body he called one body, that is, the Church, because of the
   single bridegroom, the unity of the faith, the sacraments, and the love
   of the Church. She is that seamless shirt of the Lord which was not
   rent but was allotted by the casting of lots. Therefore, this one and
   single Church has one head and not two heads,--for had she two heads,
   she would be a monster,--that is, Christ and Christ's vicar, Peter and
   Peter's successor. For the Lord said unto Peter, "Feed my sheep." "My,"
   he said, speaking generally and not particularly, "these and those," by
   which it is to be understood that all the sheep are committed unto him.
   So, when the Greeks or others say that they were not committed to the
   care of Peter and his successors, they must confess that they are not
   of Christ's sheep, even as the Lord says in John, "There is one fold
   and one shepherd."

   That in her and within her power are two swords, we are taught in the
   Gospels, namely, the spiritual sword and the temporal sword. For when
   the Apostles said, "Lo, here,"--that is in the Church,--are two swords,
   the Lord did not reply to the Apostles "it is too much," but "it is
   enough." It is certain that whoever denies that the temporal sword is
   in the power of Peter, hearkens ill to the words of the Lord which he
   spake, "Put up thy sword into its sheath." Therefore, both are in the
   power of the Church, namely, the spiritual sword and the temporal
   sword; the latter is to be used for the Church, the former by the
   Church; the former by the hand of the priest, the latter by the hand of
   princes and kings, but at the nod and sufferance of the priest. The one
   sword must of necessity be subject to the other, and the temporal
   authority to the spiritual. For the Apostle said, "There is no power
   but of God, and the powers that be are ordained of God;" and they would
   not have been ordained unless one sword had been made subject to the
   other, and even as the lower is subjected by the other for higher
   things. For, according to Dionysius, it is a divine law that the lowest
   things are made by mediocre things to attain to the highest. For it is
   not according to the law of the universe that all things in an equal
   way and immediately should reach their end, but the lowest through the
   mediocre and the lower through the higher. But that the spiritual power
   excels the earthly power in dignity and worth, we will the more clearly
   acknowledge just in proportion as the spiritual is higher than the
   temporal. And this we perceive quite distinctly from the donation of
   the tithe and functions of benediction and sanctification, from the
   mode in which the power was received, and the government of the
   subjected realms. For truth being the witness, the spiritual power has
   the functions of establishing the temporal power and sitting in
   judgment on it if it should prove to be not good. [29] And to the
   Church and the Church's power the prophecy of Jeremiah attests: "See, I
   have set thee this day over the nations and the kingdoms to pluck up
   and to break down and to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to
   plant."

   And if the earthly power deviate from the right path, it is judged by
   the spiritual power; but if a minor spiritual power deviate from the
   right path, the lower in rank is judged by its superior; but if the
   supreme power [the papacy] deviate, it can be judged not by man but by
   God alone. And so the Apostle testifies, "He which is spiritual judges
   all things, but he himself is judged by no man." But this authority,
   although it be given to a man, and though it be exercised by a man, is
   not a human but a divine power given by divine word of mouth to Peter
   and confirmed to Peter and to his successors by Christ himself, whom
   Peter confessed, even him whom Christ called the Rock. For the Lord
   said to Peter himself, "Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth," etc.
   Whoever, therefore, resists this power so ordained by God, resists the
   ordinance of God, unless perchance he imagine two principles to exist,
   as did Manichaeus, which we pronounce false and heretical. For Moses
   testified that God created heaven and earth not in the beginnings but
   "in the beginning."

   Furthermore, that every human creature is subject to the Roman
   pontiff,--this we declare, say, define, and pronounce to be altogether
   necessary to salvation.

   Bonifatius, Episcopus, Servus servorum Dei. Ad futuram rei memoriam.

   Unam sanctam ecclesiam catholicam et ipsam apostolicam urgente fide
   credere cogimur et tenere, nosque hanc frmiter credimus et simpliciter
   confitemur, extra quam nec salus est, nec remissio peccatorum, sponso
   in Canticis proclamante: Una est columba mea, perfecta mea. Una est
   matris suae electa genetrici suae [Cant. 6:9]. Quae unum corpus
   mysticum repraesentat, cujus caput Christus, Christi vero Deus. In qua
   unus Dominus, una fides, unum baptisma. Una nempe fuit diluvii tempore
   arca Noë, unam ecclesiam praefigurans, quae in uno cubito consummata
   unum, Noë videlicet, gubernatorem habuit et rectorem, extra quam omnia
   subsistentia super terram legimus fuisse deleta.

   Hanc autem veneramur et unicam, dicente Domino in Propheta: Erue a
   framea, Deus, animam meam et de manu canis unicam meam. [Psalm 22:20.]
   Pro anima enim, id est, pro se ipso, capite simul oravit et corpore.
   Quod corpus unicam scilicet ecclesiam nominavit, propter sponsi, fidei,
   sacramentorum et caritatis ecclesiae unitatem. Haec est tunica illa
   Domini inconsutilis, quae scissa non fuit, sed sorte provenit. [John
   19.]

   Igitur ecclesiae unius et unicae unum corpus, unum caput, non duo
   capita, quasi monstrum, Christus videlicet et Christi vicarius, Petrus,
   Petrique successor, dicente Domino ipsi Petro: Pasce oves meas. [John
   21:17.] Meas, inquit, generaliter, non singulariter has vel illas: per
   quod commisisse sibi intelligitur universas. Sive ergo Graeci sive alii
   se dicant Petro ejusque successoribus non esse commissos: fateantur
   necesse est, se de ovibus Christi non esse, dicente Domino in Joanne,
   unum ovile et unicum esse pastorem. [John 10:16.]

   In hac ejusque potestate duos esse gladios, spiritualem videlicet et
   temporalem, evangelicis dictis instruimur. Nam dicentibus Apostolis:
   Ecce gladii duo hic [Luke 22:38], in ecclesia scilicet, cum apostoli
   loquerentur, non respondit Dominus, nimis esse, sed satis. Certe qui in
   potestate Petri temporalem gladium esse negat, male verbum attendit
   Domini proferentis: Converte gladium tuum in vaginam. [Matt. 26:52.]
   Uterque ergo est in potestate ecclesiae, spiritualis scilicet gladius
   et materialis. Sed is quidem pro ecclesia, ille vero ab ecclesia
   exercendus, ille sacerdotis, is manu regum et militum, sed ad nutum et
   patientiam sacerdotis.

   Oportet autem gladium esse sub gladio, et temporalem auctoritatem
   spirituali subjici potestati. Nam cum dicat Apostolus: Non est potestas
   nisi a Deo; quae autem sunt, a Deo ordinata sunt [Rom. 13:1], non autem
   ordinata essent, nisi gladius esset sub gladio, et tanquam inferior
   reduceretur per alium in suprema. Nam secundum B. Dionysium lex
   dirinitatis est, infima per media in suprema reduci .... Sic de
   ecclesia et ecclesiastica potestate verificatur vaticinium Hieremiae
   [Jer. 1:10]: Ecce constitui te hodie super gentes et regna et cetera,
   quae sequuntur.

   Ergo, si deviat terrena potestas, judicabitur a potestate spirituali;
   sed, si deviat spiritualis minor, a suo superiori si vero suprema, a
   solo Deo, non ab homine poterit judicari, testante Apostolo:
   Spiritualis homo judicat omnia, ipse autem a nemine judicatur. [1 Cor.
   2:16.] Est autem haec auctoritas, etsi data sit homini, et exerceatur
   per hominem, non humana, sed potius divina potestas, ore divino Petro
   data, sibique suisque successoribus in ipso Christo, quem confessus
   fuit, petra firmata, dicente Domino ipsi Petro: Quodcunque ligaveris,
   etc. [Matt. 16:19.] Quicunque igitur huic potestati a Deo sic ordinatae
   resistit, Dei ordinationi resistit, nisi duo, sicut Manichaeus, fingat
   esse principia, quod falsum et haereticum judicamus, quia, testante
   Moyse, non in principiis, sed in principio coelum Deus creavit et
   terram. [Gen. 1:1.]

   Porro subesse Romano Pontifici omni humanae creaturae declaramus
   dicimus, definimus et pronunciamus omnino esse de necessitate salutis.

   The most astounding clause of this deliverance makes subjection to the
   pope an essential of salvation for every creature. Some writers have
   made the bold attempt to relieve the language of this construction, and
   refer it to princes and kings. So fair and sound a Roman Catholic
   writer as Funk [31] has advocated this interpretation, alleging in its
   favor the close connection of the clause with the previous statements
   through the particle porro, furthermore, and the consideration that the
   French people would not have resented the assertion that obedience to
   the papacy is a condition of salvation. But the overwhelming majority
   of Catholic historians take the words in their natural meaning. [32]
   The expression "every human creature" would be a most unlikely one to
   be used as synonymous with temporal rulers. Boniface made the same
   assertion in a letter to the duke of Savoy, 1300, when he demanded
   submission for every mortal,--omnia anima. Aegidius Colonna paraphrased
   the bull in these words, "the supreme pontiff is that authority to
   which every soul must yield subjection." [33] That the mediaeval Church
   accepted this construction is vouched for by the Fifth Lateran Council,
   1516, which, in reaffirming the bull, declared "it necessary to
   salvation that all the faithful of Christ be subject to the Roman
   pontiff." [34]

   [22] Sciat maxima tua fatuitas in temporalibus nos alicui non subesse,
   etc. Hefele, VI. 332, calls in question the authenticity of this
   document, at the same time recognizing that it was circulated in Rome
   in 1802, and that the pope himself made reference to it. The original
   phrase is ascribed to Pierre Flotte, Scholz, p. 357. Flotte was an
   uncompromising advocate of the king's sovereignty and independence of
   the pope. He made a deep impression by an address at the parliament
   called by Philip, 1302. He was probably the author of the anti-papal
   tract beginning Antequam essent clerici, the text of which is printed
   by Dupuy, pp. 21-23. Here he asserts that the Church consists of laymen
   as well as clerics, Scholz, p. 361, and that taxes levied upon Church
   property are not extortions.

   [25] VIII. 63. Döllinger, whose account is very vivid, depends chiefly
   upon the testimony of three eye-witnesses, a member of the curia, the
   chronicler of Orvieto and Nogaret himself. He sets aside much of
   Villani's report, which Reumont, Wattenbach, Gregorovius, and other
   historians adopt. Dante and Villani, who both condemn the pope's
   arrogance and nepotism, resented the indignity put upon Boniface at
   Anagni, and rejoiced over his deliverance as of one who, like Christ,
   rose from the dead. Dante omits all reference to Sciarra Colonna and
   other Italian nobles as participants in the plot. Dante's description
   is given in Paradiso, xx. 86 sqq. "I see the flower-de-luce Alagna
   [Anagni] enter, And Christ in his own vicar captive made."

   [26] Ferretus of Vicenza, Muratori: Scriptores, IX. 1002, reports that
   Boniface wanted to be removed from St. Peter's to the Lateran, but the
   Colonna sent word he was in custody.

   [27] Extra mentem positus. Ferretus relates that Boniface fell into a
   rage and, after gnawing his staff and striking his head against the
   wall, hanged himself. Villani, VIII. 63, speaks of a "strange malady"
   begotten in the pope so that he gnawed at himself as if he were mad.
   The chronicler of Orvieto, see Döllinger: Beiträge, etc., III. 353,
   says Boniface died weighed down by despondency and the infirmities of
   age, ubi tristitia et senectutis infirmitate gravatus mortuus est. It
   is charitable to suppose that the pope's old enemy, the stone, returned
   to plague him, the malady from which the Spanish physician Arnald of
   Villanova had given him relief. See Finke, p. 200 sqq.

   [28] Kirchengesch., II. 597 sq. Boniface called the French "dogs" and
   Philip garçon, which had the meaning of street urchin. A favorite
   expression with him was ribaldus, rascal, and he called Charles of
   Naples "meanest of rascals," vilissimus ribaldus. See Finke, p. 292 sq.
   Finke's judgment is based in part upon new documents he found in
   Barcelona and other libraries.

   [29] This passage is based almost word for word upon Hugo de St.

   made by Abbé Mury, La Bulle Unam sanctam, in Rev. des questions histor.
   1879, on the ground of the bull's stinging affirmations and verbal
   obscurities to detect the hand of a forger, but Cardinal Hergenröther,
   Kirchengesch., II. 694, pronounces the genuineness to be above dispute.

   [32] So Hergenröther-Kirsch, Hefele-Knöpfler: Kirchengesch., p. 380,

   § 5. Literary Attacks against the Papacy.

   Nothing is more indicative of the intellectual change going on in
   Western Europe in the fourteenth century than the tractarian literature
   of the time directed against claims made by the papacy. Three periods
   may be distinguished. In the first belong the tracts called forth by
   the struggle of Philip the Fair and Boniface VIII., with the year 1302
   for its centre. Their distinguishing feature is the attack made upon
   the pope's jurisdiction in temporal affairs. The second period opens
   during the pontificate of John XXII. and extends from 1320-1340. Here
   the pope's spiritual supremacy was attacked. The most prominent writer
   of the time was Marsiglius of Padua. The third period begins with the
   papal schism toward the end of the fourteenth century. The writers of
   this period emphasized the need of reform in the Church and discussed
   the jurisdiction of general councils as superior to the jurisdiction of
   the pope. [35]

   The publicists of the age of Boniface VIII. and Philip the Fair now
   defended, now openly attacked the mediaeval theory of the pope's
   lordship over kings and nations. The body of literature they produced
   was unlike anything which Europe had seen before. In the conflict
   between Gregory IX. and Frederick II., Europe was filled with the
   epistolary appeals of pope and emperor, who sought each to make good
   his case before the court of European public opinion, and more
   especially of the princes and prelates. The controversy of this later
   time was participated in by a number of writers who represented the
   views of an intelligent group of clerics and laymen. They employed a
   vigorous style adapted to make an impression on the public mind.

   Stirred by the haughty assertions of Boniface, a new class of men, the
   jurisconsults, entered the lists and boldly called in question the old
   order represented by the policy of Hildebrand and Innocent III. They
   had studied in the universities, especially in the University of Paris,
   and some of them, like Dubois, were laymen. The decision of the Bologna
   jurists on the field of Roncaglia was reasserted with new arguments and
   critical freedom, and a step was taken far in advance of that decision
   which asserted the independence of the emperor. The empire was set
   aside as an antiquated institution, and France and other states were
   pronounced sovereign within their own limits and immune from papal
   dominion over their temporal affairs. The principles of human law and
   the natural rights of man were arrayed against dogmatic assertions
   based upon unbalanced and false interpretations of Scripture. The
   method of scholastic sophistry was largely replaced by an appeal to
   common sense and regard for the practical needs of society. The
   authorities used to establish the new theory were Aristotle, the
   Scriptures and historic facts. These writers were John the Baptists
   preparing the way for the more clearly outlined and advanced views of
   Marsiglius of Padua and Ockam, who took the further step of questioning
   or flatly denying the pope's spiritual supremacy, and for the still
   more advanced and more spiritual appeals of Wyclif and Luther. A direct
   current of influence can be traced back from the Protestant Reformation
   to the anti-papal tracts of the first decade of the fourteenth century.

   The tract writers of the reign of Philip the Fair, who defended the
   traditional theory of the pope's absolute supremacy in all matters,
   were the Italians Aegidius Colonna, James of Viterbo, Henry of Cremona,
   and Augustinus Triumphus. The writers who attacked the papal claim to
   temporal power are divided into two groups. To the first belongs Dante,
   who magnified the empire and the station of the emperor as the supreme
   ruler over the temporal affairs of men. The men of the second group
   were associated more or less closely with the French court and were,
   for the most part, Frenchmen. They called in question the authority of
   the emperor. Among their leaders were John of Paris and Peter Dubois.
   In a number of cases their names are forgotten or uncertain, while
   their tracts have survived. It will be convenient first to take up the
   theory of Dante, and then to present the views of papal and anti-papal
   writings which were evidently called forth by the struggle started by
   Boniface.

   Dante was in nowise associated with the court of Philip the Fair, and
   seems to have been moved to write his treatise on government, the De
   monarchia, by general considerations and not by any personal sympathy
   with the French king. His theory embodies views in direct antagonism to
   those promulged in Boniface's bull Unam sanctam, and Thomas Aquinas,
   whose theological views Dante followed, is here set aside. [36] The
   independence and sovereignty of the civil estate is established by
   arguments drawn from reason, Aristotle, and the Scriptures. In making
   good his position, the author advances three propositions, devoting a
   chapter to each: (1) Universal monarchy or empire, for the terms are
   used synonymously, is necessary. (2) This monarchy belongs to the Roman
   people. (3) It was directly bequeathed to the Romans by God, and did
   not come through the mediation of the Church.

   The interests of society, so the argument runs, require an impartial
   arbiter, and only a universal monarch bound by no local ties can be
   impartial. A universal monarchy will bring peace, the peace of which
   the angels sang on the night of Christ's birth, and it will bring
   liberty, God's greatest gift to man. [37] Democracy reduces men to
   slavery. The Romans are the noblest people and deserve the right to
   rule. This is evident from the fine manhood of Aeneas, their
   progenitor, [38] from the evident miracles which God wrought in their
   history and from their world-wide dominion. This right to rule was
   established under the Christian dispensation by Christ himself, who
   submitted to Roman jurisdiction in consenting to be born under Augustus
   and to suffer under Tiberius. It was attested by the Church when Paul
   said to Festus, "I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be
   judged," Acts 25:10. There are two governing agents necessary to
   society, the pope and the emperor. The emperor is supreme in temporal
   things and is to guide men to eternal life in accordance with the
   truths of revelation. Nevertheless, the emperor should pay the pope the
   reverence which a first-born son pays to his father, such reverence as
   Charlemagne paid to Leo III. [39]

   In denying the subordination of the civil power, Dante rejects the
   figure comparing the spiritual and temporal powers to the sun and moon,
   [40] and the arguments drawn from the alleged precedence of Levi over
   Judah on the ground of the priority of Levi's birth; from the oblation
   of the Magi at the manger and from the sentence passed upon Saul by
   Samuel. He referred the two swords both to spiritual functions. Without
   questioning the historical occurrence, he set aside Constantine's
   donation to Sylvester on the ground that the emperor no more had the
   right to transfer his empire in the West than he had to commit suicide.
   Nor had the pope a right to accept the gift. [41] In the Inferno Dante
   applied to that transaction the oft-quoted lines: [42] --


   "Ah, Constantine, of how much ill was cause,

   Not thy conversion, but those rich domains

   Which the first wealthy pope received of thee."

   The Florentine poet's universal monarchy has remained an ideal
   unrealized, like the republic of the Athenian philosopher. [43]
   Conception of popular liberty as it is conceived in this modern age,
   Dante had none. Nevertheless, he laid down the important principle that
   the government exists for the people, and not the people for the
   government. [44]

   The treatise De monarchia was burnt as heretical, 1329, by order of
   John XXII. and put on the Index by the Council of Trent. In recent
   times it has aided the Italian patriots in their work of unifying Italy
   and separating politics from the Church according to Cavour's maxim, "a
   free Church in a free state."

   In the front rank of the champions of the temporal power of the papacy
   stood Aegidius Colonna, called also Aegidius Romanus, 1247-1316. [45]
   He was an Augustinian, and rose to be general of his order. He became
   famous as a theological teacher and, in 1287, his order placed his
   writings in all its schools. [46] In 1295 he was made archbishop of
   Bourges, Boniface setting aside in his favor the cleric nominated by
   Coelestine. Aegidius participated in the council in Rome, 1301, which
   Philip the Fair forbade the French prelates to attend. He was an
   elaborate writer, and in 1304 no less than 12 of his theological works
   and 14 of his philosophical writings were in use in the University of
   Paris.

   The tract by which Aegidius is chiefly known is his Power of the
   Supreme Pontiff--De ecclesiastica sive de summit pontificis potestate.
   It was the chief work of its time in defence of the papacy, and seems
   to have been called forth by the Roman Council and to have been written
   in 1301. [47] It was dedicated to Boniface VIII. Its main positions are
   the following: --

   The pope judges all things and is judged by no man, 1 Cor. 2:15. To him
   belongs plenary power, plenitudo potestatis. This power is without
   measure, without number, and without weight. [48] It extends over all
   Christians. The pope is above all laws and in matters of faith
   infallible. He is like the sea which fills all vessels, like the sun
   which, as the universally active principle, sends his rays into all
   things. The priesthood existed before royalty. Abel and Noah, priests,
   preceded Nimrod, who was the first king. As the government of the world
   is one and centres in one ruler, God, so in the affairs of the militant
   Church there can be only one source of power, one supreme government,
   one head to whom belongs the plenitude of power. This is the supreme
   pontiff. The priesthood and the papacy are of immediate divine
   appointment. Earthly kingdoms, except as they have been established by
   the priesthood, owe their origin to usurpation, robbery, and other
   forms of violence. [49] In these views Aegidius followed Augustine: De
   civitate, IV. 4, and Gregory VII. The state, however, he declared to be
   necessary as a means through which the Church works to accomplish its
   divinely appointed ends.

   In the second part of his tract, Aegidius proves that, in spite of
   Numb. 18:20, 21, and Luke 10:4, the Church has the right to possess
   worldly goods. The Levites received cities. In fact, all temporal goods
   are under the control of the Church. [50] As the soul rules the body,
   so the pope rules over all temporal matters. The tithe is a perpetual
   obligation. No one has a right to the possession of a single acre of
   ground or a vineyard without the Church's permission and unless he be
   baptized.

   The fulness of power, residing in the pope, gives him the right to
   appoint to all benefices in Christendom, but, as God chooses to rule
   through the laws of nature, so the pope rules through the laws of the
   Church, but he is not bound by them. He may himself be called the
   Church. For the pope's power is spiritual, heavenly and divine.
   Aegidius was used by his successors, James of Viterbo, Augustinus
   Triumphus and Alvarus, and also by John of Paris and Gerson who
   contested some of his main positions. [51]

   The second of these writers, defending the position of Boniface VIII.,
   was James of Viterbo, [52] d. 1308. He also was an Italian, belonged to
   the Augustinian order, and gained prominence as a teacher in Paris. In
   1302 he was appointed by Boniface archbishop of Beneventum, and a few
   months later archbishop of Naples. His Christian Government--De
   regimine christiano -- is, after the treatise of Aegidius, the most
   comprehensive of the papal tracts. It also was dedicated to Boniface
   VIII., who is addressed as "the holy lord of the kings of the earth."
   The author distinctly says he was led to write by the attacks made upon
   the papal prerogative.

   To Christ's vicar, James says, royalty and priesthood, regnum et
   sacerdotium, belong. Temporal authority was not for the first time
   conferred on him when Constantine gave Sylvester the dominion of the
   West. Constantine did nothing more than confirm a previous right
   derived from Christ, when he said, "whatsoever ye shall bind on earth
   shall be bound in heaven." Priests are kings, and the pope is the king
   of kings, both in mundane and spiritual matters. [53] He is the bishop
   of the earth, the supreme lawgiver. Every soul must be subject to him
   in order to salvation. [54] By reason of his fulness of power, the
   supreme pontiff can act according to law or against it, as he chooses.
   [55]

   Henry of Cassaloci, or Henry of Cremona, as he is usually called from
   his Italian birthplace, d. 1312, is mentioned, contrary to the custom
   of the age, by name by John of Paris, as the author of the tract, The
   Power of the Pope--De potestate papae. [56] He was a distinguished
   authority in canon law and consulted by Boniface. He was appointed,
   1302, a member of the delegation to carry to Philip the Fair the two
   notorious bulls, Salvator mundi and Ausculta fili. The same year he was
   appointed bishop of Reggio. [57] The papal defenders were well paid.

   Henry began his tract with the words of Matt. 27:18, "All power is
   given unto me," and declared the attack against the pope's temporal
   jurisdiction over the whole earth a matter of recent date, and made by
   "sophists" who deserved death. Up to that time no one had made such
   denial. He attempts to make out his fundamental thesis from Scripture,
   the Fathers, canon law, and reason. God at first ruled through Noah,
   the patriarchs, Melchizedec, and Moses, who were priests and kings at
   the same time. Did not Moses punish Pharaoh? Christ carried both
   swords. Did he not drive out the money-changers and wear the crown of
   thorns? To him the power was given to judge the world. John 5:22. The
   same power was entailed upon Peter and his successors. As for the
   state, it bears to the Church the relation of the moon to the sun, and
   the emperor has only such power as the pope is ready to confer. Henry
   also affirms that Constantine's donation established no right, but
   confirmed what the pope already possessed by virtue of heavenly gift.
   [58] The pope transferred the empire to Charlemagne, and Innocent IV.
   asserted the papal supremacy over kings by deposing Frederick II. If in
   early and later times the persons of popes were abused, this was not
   because they lacked supreme authority in the earth [59] or were in
   anywise subject to earthly princes. No emperor can legally exercise
   imperial functions without papal consecration. When Christ said, "my
   kingdom is not of this world," he meant nothing more than that the
   world refused to obey him. As for the passage, "render to Caesar the
   things which are Caesar's," Christ was under no obligation to give
   tribute to the emperor, and the children of the kingdom are free, as
   Augustine, upon the basis of Matt. 27:26 sq., said.

   The main work of another defender of the papal prerogatives, Augustinus
   Triumphus, belongs to the next period. [60]

   An intermediate position between these writers and the anti-papal
   publicists was taken by the Cardinals Colonna and their immediate
   supporters. [61] In their zeal against Boniface VIII. they questioned
   the absolute power of the Church in temporal concerns, and placed the
   supreme spiritual authority in the college of cardinals, with the pope
   as its head.

   Among the advanced writers of the age was William Durante, d. 1381, an
   advocate of Gallicanism. [62] He was appointed bishop of Mende before
   he had reached the canonical age. He never came under the condemnation
   of the Church. In a work composed at the instance of Clement V. on
   general councils and the reformation of Church abuses, De modo
   generalis concilii celebrandi et corruptelis in ecclesiis reformandis,
   he demanded a reformation of the Church in head and members, [63] using
   for the first time this expression which was so often employed in a
   later age. He made the pope one of the order of bishops on all of whom
   was conferred equally the power to bind and to loose. [64] The bishops
   are not the pope's assistants, the view held by Innocent III., but
   agents directly appointed by God with independent jurisdiction. The
   pope may not act out of harmony with the canons of the early Church
   except with the approval of a general council. When new measures are
   contemplated, a general council should be convened, and one should be
   called every ten years. [65]

   Turning now to the writers who contested the pope's right to temporal
   authority over the nations, we find that while the most of them were
   clerics, all of them were jurists. It is characteristic that besides
   appealing to Aristotle, the Scriptures, and the canon law, they also
   appealed to the Roman law. We begin with several pamphlets whose
   authorship is a matter of uncertainty.

   The Twofold Prerogative--Quaestio in utramque partem -- was probably
   written in 1302, and by a Frenchman. [66] The tract clearly sets forth
   that the two functions, the spiritual and the temporal, are distinct,
   and that the pope has plenary power only in the spiritual realm. It is
   evident that they are not united in one person, from Christ's refusal
   of the office of king and from the law prohibiting the Levites holding
   worldly possessions. Canon law and Roman law recognized the
   independence of the civil power. Both estates are of God. At best the
   pope's temporal authority extends to the patrimony of Peter. The empire
   is one among the powers, without authority over other states. As for
   the king of France, he would expose himself to the penalty of death if
   he were to recognize the pope as overlord. [67]

   The same positions are taken in the tract, [68] The Papal
   Power,--Quaestio de potestate papae. The author insists that temporal
   jurisdiction is incompatible with the pope's office. He uses the figure
   of the body to represent the Church, giving it a new turn. Christ is
   the head. The nerves and veins are officers in the Church and state.
   They depend directly upon Christ, the head. The heart is the king. The
   pope is not even called the head. The soul is not mentioned. The old
   application of the figure of the body and the soul, representing
   respectively the regnum and the sacerdotium, is set aside. The pope is
   a spiritual father, not the lord over Christendom. Moses was a temporal
   ruler and Aaron was priest. The functions and the functionaries were
   distinct. At best, the donation of Constantine had no reference to
   France, for France was distinct from the empire. The deposition of
   Childerich by Pope Zacharias established no right, for all that
   Zacharias did was, as a wise counsellor, to give the barons advice.

   A third tract, one of the most famous pieces of this literature, the
   Disputation between a Cleric and a Knight, [69] was written to defend
   the sovereignty of the state and its right to levy taxes upon Church
   property. The author maintains that the king of France is in duty bound
   to see that Church property is administered according to the intent for
   which it was given. As he defends the Church against foreign foes, so
   he has the right to put the Church under tribute.

   In the publicist, John of Paris, d. 1306, we have one of the leading
   minds of the age. [70] He was a Dominican, and enjoyed great fame as a
   preacher and master. On June 26, 1303, he joined 132 other Parisian
   Dominicans in signing a document calling for a general council, which
   the university had openly favored five days before. [71] His views of
   the Lord's Supper brought upon him the charge of heresy, and he was
   forbidden to give lectures at the university. [72] He appealed to
   Clement V., but died before he could get a hearing.

   John's chief writing was the tract on the Authority of the Pope and
   King, --De potestate regia et papali, [73] -- which almost breathes the
   atmosphere of modern times.

   John makes a clear distinction between the "body of the faithful,"
   which is the Church, and the "body of the clergy." [74] The Church has
   its unity in Christ, who established the two estates, spiritual and
   temporal. They are the same in origin, but distinguished on earth. The
   pope has the right to punish moral offences, but only with spiritual
   punishments. The penalties of death, imprisonment, and fines, he has no
   right to impose. Christ had no worldly jurisdiction, and the pope
   should keep clear of "Herod's old error." [75] Constantine had no right
   to confer temporal power on Sylvester. John adduced 42 reasons urged in
   favor of the pope's omnipotence in temporal affairs and offers a
   refutation for each of them.

   As for the pope's place in the Church, the pope is the representative
   of the ecclesiastical body, not its lord. The Church may call him to
   account. If the Church were to elect representatives to act with the
   supreme pontiff, we would have the best of governments. As things are,
   the cardinals are his advisers and may admonish him and, in case he
   persists in his error, they may call to their aid the temporal arm. The
   pope may be deposed by an emperor, as was actually the case when three
   popes were deposed by Henry III. The final seat of ecclesiastical
   authority is the general council. It may depose a pope. Valid grounds
   of deposition are insanity, heresy, personal incompetence and abuse of
   the Church's property.

   Following Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas, John derived the state from the
   family and not from murder and other acts of violence. [76] It is a
   community organized for defence and bodily well-being. With other
   jurists, he regarded the empire as an antiquated institution and, if it
   continues to exist, it is on a par with the monarchies, not above them.
   Climate and geographical considerations make different monarchies
   necessary, and they derive their authority from God. Thus John and
   Dante, while agreeing as to the independence of the state, differ as to
   the seat where secular power resides. Dante placed it in a universal
   empire, John of Paris in separate monarchies.

   The boldest and most advanced of these publicists, Pierre Dubois, [77]
   was a layman, probably a Norman, and called himself a royal attorney.
   [78] As a delegate to the national council in Paris, April, 1302, he
   represented Philip's views. He was living as late as 1321. In a number
   of tracts he supported the contention of the French monarch against
   Boniface VIII. [79] France is independent of the empire, and absolutely
   sovereign in all secular matters. The French king is the successor of
   Charlemagne. The pope is the moral teacher of mankind, "the light of
   the world," but he has no jurisdiction in temporal affairs. It is his
   function to care for souls, to stop wars, to exercise oversight over
   the clergy, but his jurisdiction extends no farther.

   The pope and clergy are given to worldliness and self-indulgence.
   Boniface is a heretic. The prelates squander the Church's money in wars
   and litigations, prefer the atmosphere of princely courts, and neglect
   theology and the care of souls. The avarice of the curia and the pope
   leads them to scandalous simony and nepotism. [80] Constantine's
   donation marked the change to worldliness among the clergy. It was
   illegal, and the only title the pope can show to temporal power over
   the patrimony of Peter is long tenure. The first step in the direction
   of reforms would be for clergy and pope to renounce worldly possessions
   altogether. This remedy had been prescribed by Arnold of Brescia and
   Frederick II.

   Dubois also criticised the rule and practice of celibacy. Few clergymen
   keep their vows. And yet they are retained, while ordination is denied
   to married persons. This is in the face of the fact that the Apostle
   permitted marriage to all. The practice of the Eastern church is to be
   preferred. The rule of single life is too exacting, especially for
   nuns. Durante had proposed the abrogation of the rule, and Arnald of
   Villanova had emphasized the sacredness of the marriage tie, recalling
   that it was upon a married man, Peter, that Christ conferred the
   primacy. [81]

   Dubois showed the freshness of his mind by suggestions of a practical
   nature. He proposed the colonization of the Holy Land by Christian
   people, and the marriage of Christian women to Saracens of station as a
   means of converting them. As a measure for securing the world's
   conversion, he recommended to Clement the establishment of schools for
   boys and girls in every province, where instruction should be given in
   different languages. The girls were to be taught Latin and the
   fundamentals of natural science, and especially medicine and surgery,
   that they might serve as female physicians among women in the more
   occult disorders.

   A review of the controversial literature of the age of Philip the Fair
   shows the new paths along which men's thoughts were moving. [82] The
   papal apologists insisted upon traditional interpretations of a limited
   number of texts, the perpetual validity of Constantine's donation, and
   the transfer of the empire. They were forever quoting Innocent's famous
   bull, Per venerabilem. [83] On the other hand, John of Paris, and the
   publicists who sympathized with him, as also Dante, corrected and
   widened the vision of the field of Scripture, and brought into
   prominence the common rights of man. The resistance which the king of
   France offered to the demands of Boniface encouraged writers to speak
   without reserve.

   The pope's spiritual primacy was left untouched. The attack was against
   his temporal jurisdiction. The fiction of the two swords was set aside.
   The state is as supreme in its sphere as the Church in its sphere, and
   derives its authority immediately from God. Constantine had no right to
   confer the sovereignty of the West upon Sylvester, and his gift
   constitutes no valid papal claim. Each monarch is supreme in his own
   realm, and the theory of the overlordship of the emperor is abandoned
   as a thing out of date.

   The pope's tenure of office was made subject to limitation. He may be
   deposed for heresy and incompetency. Some writers went so far as to
   deny to him jurisdiction over Church property. The advisory function of
   the cardinals was emphasized and the independent authority of the
   bishops affirmed. Above all, the authority residing in the Church as a
   body of believers was discussed, and its voice, as uttered through a
   general council, pronounced to be superior to the authority of the
   pope. The utterances of John of Paris and Peter Dubois on the subject
   of general councils led straight on to the views propounded during the
   papal schism at the close of the fourteenth century. [84] Dubois
   demanded that laymen as well as clerics should have a voice in them.
   The rule of clerical celibacy was attacked, and attention called to its
   widespread violation in practice. Pope and clergy were invoked to
   devote themselves to the spiritual well-being of mankind, and to foster
   peaceable measures for the world's conversion.

   This freedom of utterance and changed way of thinking mark the
   beginning of one of the great revolutions in the history of the
   Christian Church. To these publicists the modern world owes a debt of
   gratitude. Principles which are now regarded as axiomatic were new for
   the Christian public of their day. A generation later, Marsiglius of
   Padua defined them again with clearness, and took a step still further
   in advance.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [35] I have followed closely in this chapter the clear and learned
   presentations of Richard Scholz and Finke and the documents they print
   as well as the documents given by Goldast. See below. A most useful
   contribution to the study of the age of Boniface VIII. and the papal
   theories current at the time would be the publication of the tracts
   mentioned in this section and others in a single volume.

   [36] The date of the De monarchia is a matter of uncertainty. There are
   no references in the treatise to Dante's own personal affairs or the
   contemporary events of Europe to give any clew (sic). Witte, the
   eminent Dante student, put it in 1301; so also R. W. Church, on the
   ground that Dante makes no reference to his exile, which began in 1301.
   The tendency now is to follow Boccaccio, who connected the treatise
   with the election of Henry VII. or Henry's journey to Rome, 1311. The
   treatise would then be a manifesto for the restoration of the empire to
   its original authority. For a discussion of the date, see Henry:
   Dante's de monarchia, XXXII. sqq.

   [37] Libertus est maximum donum humanae naturae a Deo collatum, I. 14.
   It is a striking coincidence that Leo XIII. began his encyclical of
   June 20, 1888, with these similar words, libertas praestantissimum
   naturae donum, "liberty, the most excellent gift of nature."

   [38] ii. 3. Dante appeals to the testimony of Virgil, his guide through
   hell and purgatory. He also quotes Virgil's proud lines:-- "Tu regere
   imperii populos, Romane, memento. Haec tibi erunt artes, pacisque
   imponere morem Parcere subjectis et debellare superbos." Roman,
   remember that it was given to thee to rule the nations. Thine it is to
   establish peace, spare subject peoples and war against the proud.

   [39] ii. 12, 13; iii. 13, 16.

   [40] This last section of the book has the heading auctoritatem imperii
   immediate dependere a Deo.

   [41] iii. 10, Constantinus alienare non poterat imperii dignitatem nec
   ecclesia recipere.

   [42] xix. 115 sqq. Ahi, Constantin, di quanto mal fu matre, Non la tua
   conversion, ma quella dote Che da te prese il primo ricco padre! In the
   Purgatorio, xvi. 106-112, Dante deplores the union of the crozier and
   the sword.

   [43] With reference to the approaching termination of the emperor's
   influence in Italian affairs, Bryce, ch. XV., sententiously says that
   Dante's De monarchia was an epitaph, not a prophecy.

   [44] Non cives propter consules nec gens propter regem sed e converso
   consules propter cives, rex propter gentem, iii. 14.

   [47] Jourdain, in 1858, was the first to call attention to the
   manuscript, and Kraus the first to give a summary of its positions in
   the Oesterr. Vierteljahrsschrift, Vienna, 1862, pp. 1-33. Among
   Aegidius' other tracts is the "Rule of Princes,"--De regimine principum
   --1285, printed 1473. It was at once translated into French and Italian
   and also into Spanish, Portuguese, English, and even Hebrew. The
   "Pope's Abdication"--De renunciatione papae sive apologia pro Bonifacio
   VIII.--1297, was a reply to the manifesto of the Colonna, contesting a
   pope's right to resign his office. For a list of Aegidius' writings,
   see art. Colonna Aegidius, in Wetzer-Welte, III. 667-671. See Scholz,
   pp. 46, 126.

   [48] Aegidius quotes the Wisdom of Solomon 2:21

   [49] See Scholz, p. 96 sqq. This author says the de regimine principum
   of Aegidius presents a different view, and following Aristotle, derives
   the state from the social principle.

   § 6. The Transfer of the Papacy to Avignon.

   The successor of Boniface, Benedict XI., 1303-1304, a Dominican, was a
   mild-spirited and worthy man, more bent on healing ruptures than on
   forcing his arbitrary will. Departing from the policy of his
   predecessor, he capitulated to the state and put an end to the conflict
   with Philip the Fair. Sentences launched by Boniface were recalled or
   modified, and the interdict pronounced by that pope upon Lyons was
   revoked. Palestrina was restored to the Colonna. Only Sciarra Colonna
   and Nogaret were excepted from the act of immediate clemency and
   ordered to appear at Rome. Benedict's death, after a brief reign of
   eight months, was ascribed to poison secreted in a dish of figs, of
   which the pope partook freely. [85]

   The conclave met in Perugia, where Benedict died, and was torn by
   factions. After an interval of nearly eleven months, the French party
   won a complete triumph by the choice of Bertrand de Got, archbishop of
   Bordeaux, who took the name of Clement V. At the time of his election,
   Bertrand was in France. He never crossed the Alps. After holding his
   court at Bordeaux, Poictiers, and Toulouse, he chose, in 1309, Avignon
   as his residence.

   Thus began the so-called Babylonian captivity, or Avignon exile, of the
   papacy, which lasted more than seventy years and included seven popes,
   all Frenchmen, Clement V., 1305-1314; John XXII., 1316-1334; Benedict
   XII., 1334-1342; Clement VI., 1342-1352; Innocent VI., 1352-1362; Urban
   V., 1362-1370; Gregory XI., 1370-1378. This prolonged absence from Rome
   was a great shock to the papal system. Transplanted from its maternal
   soil, the papacy was cut loose from the hallowed and historical
   associations of thirteen centuries. It no longer spake as from the
   centre of the Christian world.

   The way had been prepared for the abandonment of the Eternal City and
   removal to French territory. Innocent II. and other popes had found
   refuge in France. During the last half of the thirteenth century the
   Apostolic See, in its struggle with the empire, had leaned upon France
   for aid. To avoid Frederick II., Innocent IV. had fled to Lyons, 1245.
   If Boniface VIII. represents a turning-point in the history of the
   papacy, the Avignon residence shook the reverence of Christendom for
   it. It was in danger of becoming a French institution. Not only were
   the popes all Frenchmen, but the large majority of the cardinals were
   of French birth. Both were reduced to a station little above that of
   court prelates subject to the nod of the French sovereign. At the same
   time, the popes continued to exercise their prerogatives over the other
   nations of Western Christendom, and freely hurled anathemas at the
   German emperor and laid the interdict upon Italian cities. The word
   might be passed around, "where the pope is, there is Rome," but the
   wonder is that the grave hurt done to his oecumenical character was not
   irreparable. [86]

   The morals of Avignon during the papal residence were notorious
   throughout Europe. The papal household had all the appearance of a
   worldly court, torn by envies and troubled by schemes of all sorts.
   Some of the Avignon popes left a good name, but the general impression
   was bad--weak if not vicious. The curia was notorious for its
   extravagance, venality, and sensuality. Nepotism, bribery, and simony
   were unblushingly practised. The financial operations of the papal
   family became oppressive to an extent unknown before. Indulgences,
   applied to all sorts of cases, were made a source of increasing
   revenue. Alvarus Pelagius, a member of the papal household and a
   strenuous supporter of the papacy, in his De planctu ecclesiae,
   complained bitterly of the speculation and traffic in ecclesiastical
   places going on at the papal court. It swarmed with money-changers, and
   parties bent on money operations. Another contemporary, Petrarch, who
   never uttered a word against the papacy as a divine institution,
   launched his satires against Avignon, which he called "the sink of
   every vice, the haunt of all iniquities, a third Babylon, the Babylon
   of the West." No expression is too strong to carry his biting
   invectives. Avignon is the "fountain of afflictions, the refuge of
   wrath, the school of errors, a temple of lies, the awful prison, hell
   on earth." [87] But the corruption of Avignon was too glaring to make
   it necessary for him to invent charges. This ill-fame gives Avignon a
   place at the side of the courts of Louis XIV. and Charles II. of
   England.

   During this papal expatriation, Italy fell into a deplorable condition.
   Rome, which had been the queen of cities, the goal of pilgrims, the
   centre towards which the pious affections of all Western Europe turned,
   the locality where royal and princely embassies had sought ratification
   for ambitious plans--Rome was now turned into an arena of wild
   confusion and riot. Contending factions of nobles, the Colonna, Orsini,
   Gaetani, and others, were in constant feud, [88] and strove one with
   the other for the mastery in municipal affairs and were often
   themselves set aside by popular leaders whose low birth they despised.
   The source of her gains gone, the city withered away and was reduced to
   the proportions, the poverty, and the dull happenings of a provincial
   town, till in 1370 the population numbered less than 20,000. She had no
   commerce to stir her pulses like the young cities in Northern and
   Southern Germany and in Lombardy. Obscurity and melancholy settled upon
   her palaces and public places, broken only by the petty attempts at
   civic displays, which were like the actings of the circus ring compared
   with the serious manoeuvres of a military campaign. The old monuments
   were neglected or torn down. A papal legate sold the stones of the
   Colosseum to be burnt in lime-kilns, and her marbles were transported
   to other cities, so that it was said she was drawn upon more than
   Carrara. [89] Her churches became roofless. Cattle ate grass up to the
   very altars of the Lateran and St. Peter's. The movement of art was
   stopped which had begun with the arrival of Giotto, who had come to
   Rome at the call of Boniface VIII. to adorn St. Peter's. No product of
   architecture is handed down from this period except the marble stairway
   of the church of St. Maria, Ara Coeli, erected in 1348 with an
   inscription commemorating the deliverance from the plague, and the
   restored Lateran church which was burnt, 1308. [90] Ponds and débris
   interrupted the passage of the streets and filled the air with
   offensive and deadly odors. At Clement V.'s death, Napoleon Orsini
   assured Philip that the Eternal City was on the verge of destruction
   and, in 1347, Cola di Rienzo thought it more fit to be called a den of
   robbers than the residence of civilized men.

   The Italian peninsula, at least in its northern half, was a scene of
   political division and social anarchy. The country districts were
   infested with bands of brigands. The cities were given to frequent and
   violent changes of government. High officials of the Church paid the
   price of immunity from plunder and violence by exactions levied on
   other personages of station. Such were some of the immediate results of
   the exile of the papacy. Italy was in danger of succumbing to the fate
   of Hellas and being turned into a desolate waste.

   Avignon, which Clement chose as his residence, is 460 miles southeast
   of Paris and lies south of Lyons. Its proximity to the port of
   Marseilles made it accessible to Italy. It was purchased by Clement
   VI., 1348, from Naples for 80, 000 gold florins, and remained papal
   territory until the French Revolution. As early as 1229, the popes held
   territory in the vicinity, the duchy of Venaissin, which fell to them
   from the domain of Raymond of Toulouse. On every side this free papal
   home was closely confined by French territory. Clement was urged by
   Italian bishops to go to Rome, and Italian writers gave as one reason
   for his refusal fear lest he should receive meet punishment for his
   readiness to condemn Boniface VIII. [91]

   Clement's coronation was celebrated at Lyons, Philip and his brother
   Charles of Valois, the Duke of Bretagne and representatives of the king
   of England being present. Philip and the duke walked at the side of the
   pope's palfrey. By the fall of an old wall during the procession, the
   duke, a brother of the pope, and ten other persons lost their lives.
   The pope himself was thrown from his horse, his tiara rolled in the
   dust, and a large carbuncle, which adorned it, was lost. Scarcely ever
   was a papal ruler put in a more compromising position than the new
   pontiff. His subjection to a sovereign who had defied the papacy was a
   strange spectacle. He owed his tiara indirectly, if not immediately, to
   Philip the Fair. He was the man Philip wanted. [92] It was his task to
   appease the king's anger against the memory of Boniface, and to meet
   his brutal demands concerning the Knights Templars. These, with the
   Council of Vienne, which he called, were the chief historic concerns of
   his pontificate.

   The terms on which the new pope received the tiara were imposed by
   Philip himself, and, according to Villani, the price he made the Gascon
   pay included six promises. Five of them concerned the total undoing of
   what Boniface had done in his conflict with Philip. The sixth article,
   which was kept secret, was supposed to be the destruction of the order
   of the Templars. It is true that the authenticity of these six articles
   has been disputed, but there can be no doubt that from the very outset
   of Clement's pontificate, the French king pressed their execution upon
   the pope's attention. [93] Clement, in poor position to resist,
   confirmed what Benedict had done and went farther. He absolved the
   king; recalled, Feb. 1, 1306, the offensive bulls Clericis laicos and
   Unam sanctam, so far as they implied anything offensive to France or
   any subjection on the part of the king to the papal chair, not
   customary before their issue, and fully restored the cardinals of the
   Colonna family to the dignities of their office.

   The proceedings touching the character of Boniface VIII. and his right
   to a place among the popes dragged along for fully six years. Philip
   had offered, among others, his brother, Count Louis of Evreux, as a
   witness for the charge that Boniface had died a heretic. There was a
   division of sentiment among the cardinals. The Colonna were as hostile
   to the memory of Boniface as they were zealous in their writings for
   the memory of Coelestine V. They pronounced it to be contrary to the
   divine ordinance for a pope to abdicate. His spiritual marriage with
   the Church cannot be dissolved. And as for there being two popes at the
   same time, God was himself not able to constitute such a monstrosity.
   On the other hand, writers like Augustinus Triumphus defended Boniface
   and pronounced him a martyr to the interests of the Church and worthy
   of canonization. [94] In his zeal against his old enemy Philip had
   called, probably as early as 1305, for the canonization of Coelestine
   V. [95] A second time, in 1307, Boniface's condemnation was pressed
   upon Clement by the king in person. But the pope knew how to prolong
   the prosecution on all sorts of pretexts. Philip represented himself as
   concerned for the interests of religion, and Nogaret and the other
   conspirators insisted that the assault at Avignon was a religious act,
   negotium fidei. Nogaret sent forth no less than twelve apologies
   defending himself for his part in the assault. [96] In 1310 the formal
   trial began. Many witnesses appeared to testify against
   Boniface,--laymen, priests and bishops. The accusations were that the
   pope had declared all three religions false, Mohammedanism, Judaism and
   Christianity, pronounced the virgin birth a tale, denied
   transubstantiation and the existence of hell and heaven and that he had
   played games of chance.

   Clement issued one bull after another protesting the innocency of the
   offending parties concerned in the violent measures against Boniface.
   Philip and Nogaret were declared innocent of all guilt and to have only
   pure motives in preferring charges against the dead pope. [97] The
   bull, Rex gloriae, 1311, addressed to Philip, stated that the secular
   kingdom was founded by God and that France in the new dispensation
   occupied about the same place as Israel, the elect people, occupied
   under the old dispensation. Nogaret's purpose in entering into the
   agreement which resulted in the affair at Anagni was to save the Church
   from destruction at the hands of Boniface, and the plundering of the
   papal palace and church was done against the wishes of the French
   chancellor. In several bulls Clement recalled all punishments,
   statements, suspensions and declarations made against Philip and his
   kingdom, or supposed to have been made. And to fully placate the king,
   he ordered all Boniface's pronouncements of this character effaced from
   the books of the Roman Church. Thus in the most solemn papal form did
   Boniface's successor undo all that Boniface had done. [98] When the
   Oecumenical Council of Vienne met, the case of Boniface was so
   notorious a matter that it had to be taken up. After a formal trial, in
   which the accused pontiff was defended by three cardinals, he was
   adjudged not guilty. To gain this point, and to save his predecessor
   from formal condemnation, it is probable Clement had to surrender to
   Philip unqualifiedly in the matter of the Knights of the Temple.

   After long and wearisome proceedings, this order was formally
   legislated out of existence by Clement in 1312. Founded in 1119 to
   protect pilgrims and to defend the Holy Land against the Moslems, it
   had outlived its mission. Sapped of its energy by riches and
   indulgence, its once famous knights might well have disbanded and no
   interest been the worse for it. The story, however, of their forcible
   suppression awakens universal sympathy and forms one of the most
   thrilling and mysterious chapters of the age. Döllinger has called it
   "a unique drama in history." [99]

   The destruction of the Templar order was relentlessly insisted upon by
   Philip the Fair, and accomplished with the reluctant co-operation of
   Clement V. In vain did the king strive to hide the sordidness of his
   purpose under the thin mask of religious zeal. At Clement's coronation,
   if not before, Philip brought charges against it. About the same time,
   in the insurrection called forth by his debasement of the coin, the
   king took refuge in the Templars' building at Paris. In 1307 he renewed
   the charges before the pope. When Clement hesitated, he proceeded to
   violence, and on the night of Oct. 13, 1307, he had all the members of
   the order in France arrested and thrown into prison, including Jacques
   de Molay, the grand-master. Döllinger applies to this deed the strong
   language that, if he were asked to pick out from the whole history of
   the world the accursed day,--dies nefastus,--he would be able to name
   none other than Oct. 13, 1307. Three days later, Philip announced he
   had taken this action as the defender of the faith and called upon
   Christian princes to follow his example. Little as the business was to
   Clement's taste, he was not man enough to set himself in opposition to
   the king, and he gradually became complaisant. [100] The machinery of
   the Inquisition was called into use. The Dominicans, its chief agents,
   stood high in Philip's favor, and one of their number was his
   confessor. In 1308 the authorities of the state assented to the king's
   plans to bring the order to trial. The constitution of the court was
   provided for by Clement, the bishop of each diocese and two Franciscans
   and two Dominicans being associated together. A commission invested
   with general authority was to sit in Paris. [101]

   In the summer of 1308 the pope ordered a prosecution of the knights
   wherever they might be found. [102] The charges set forth were heresy,
   spitting upon the cross, worshipping an idol, Bafomet--the word for
   Mohammed in the Provençal dialect--and also the most abominable
   offences against moral decency such as sodomy and kissing the posterior
   parts and the navel of fellow knights. The members were also accused of
   having meetings with the devil who appeared in the form of a black cat
   and of having carnal intercourse with female demons. The charges which
   the lawyers and Inquisitors got together numbered 127 and these the
   pope sent through France and to other countries as the basis of the
   prosecution.

   Under the strain of prolonged torture, many of the unfortunate men gave
   assent to these charges, and more particularly to the denial of Christ
   and the spitting upon the cross. The Templars seem to have had no
   friends in high places bold enough to take their part. The king, the
   pope, the Dominican order, the University of Paris, the French
   episcopacy were against them. Many confessions once made by the victims
   were afterwards recalled at the stake. Many denied the charges
   altogether. [103] In Paris 36 died under torture, 54 suffered there at
   one burning, May 10, 1310, and 8 days later 4 more. Hundreds of them
   perished in prison. Even the bitterest enemies acknowledged that the
   Templars who were put to death maintained their innocence to their
   dying breath. [104]

   In accordance with Clement's order, trials were had in Germany, Italy,
   Spain, Portugal, Cyprus and England. In England, Edward II. at first
   refused to apply the torture, which was never formally adopted in that
   land, but later, at Clement's demand, he complied. Papal inquisitors
   appeared. Synods in London and York declared the charges of heresy so
   serious that it would be impossible for the knights to clear
   themselves. English houses were disbanded and the members distributed
   among the monasteries to do penance. In Italy and Germany, the accused
   were, for the most part, declared innocent. In Spain and Portugal, no
   evidence was forthcoming of guilt and the synod of Tarragona, 1310, and
   other synods favored their innocence.

   The last act in these hostile proceedings was opened at the Council of
   Vienne, called for the special purpose of taking action upon the order.
   The large majority of the council were in favor of giving it a new
   trial and a fair chance to prove its innocence. But the king was
   relentless. He reminded Clement that the guilt of the knights had been
   sufficiently proven, and insisted that the order be abolished. He
   appeared in person at the council, attended by a great retinue. Clement
   was overawed, and by virtue of his apostolic power issued his decree
   abolishing the Templars, March 22, 1312. [105] Clement's reasons were
   that suspicions existed that the order held to heresies, that many of
   the Templars had confessed to heresies and other offences, that
   thereafter reputable persons would not enter the order, and that it was
   no longer necessary for the defence of the Holy Land. Directions were
   given for the further procedure. The guilty were to be put to death;
   the innocent to be supported out of the revenues of the order. With
   this action the famous order passed out of existence.

   The end of Jacques de Molay, the 22d and last grand-master of the order
   of Templars, was worthy of its proudest days. At the first trial he
   confessed to the charges of denying Christ and spitting upon the cross,
   and was condemned, but afterwards recalled his confession. His case was
   reopened in 1314. With Geoffrey de Charney, grand-preceptor of
   Normandy, and others, he was led in front of Notre Dame Cathedral, and
   sentenced to perpetual imprisonment. Molay then stood forth and
   declared that the charges against the order were false, and that he had
   confessed to them under the strain of torture and instructions from the
   king. Charney said the same. The commission promised to reconsider the
   case the next day. But the king's vengeance knew no bounds, and that
   night, March 11, 1314, the prisoners were burned. The story ran that
   while the flames were doing their grewsome (sic) work, Molay summoned
   pope and king to meet him at the judgment bar within a year. The former
   died, in a little more than a month, of a loathsome disease, though
   penitent, as it was reported, for his treatment of the order, and the
   king, by accident, while engaged in the chase, six months later. The
   king was only 46 years old at the time of his death, and 14 years
   after, the last of his direct descendants was in his grave and the
   throne passed to the house of Valois.

   As for the possessions of the order, papal decrees turned them over to
   the Knights of St. John, but Philip again intervened and laid claim to
   260,000 pounds as a reimbursement for alleged losses to the Temple and
   the expense of guarding the prisoners. [106] In Spain, they passed to
   the orders of San Iago di Compostella and Calatrava. In Aragon, they
   were in part applied to a new order, Santa Maria de Montesia, and in
   Portugal to the Military Order of Jesus Christ, ordo militiae Jesu
   Christi. Repeated demands made by the pope secured the transmission of
   a large part of their possessions to the Knights of St. John. In
   England, in 1323, parliament granted their lands to the Hospitallers,
   but the king appropriated a considerable share to himself. The Temple
   in London fell to the Earl of Pembroke, 1313. [107]

   The explanation of Philip's violent animosity and persistent
   persecution is his cupidity. He coveted the wealth of the Templars.
   Philip was quite equal to a crime of this sort. [108] He robbed the
   bankers of Lombardy and the Jews of France, and debased the coin of his
   realm. A loan of 500,000 pounds which he had secured for a sister's
   dowry had involved him in great financial straits. He appropriated all
   the possessions of the Templars he could lay his hands upon. Clement
   V.'s subserviency it is easy to explain. He was a creature of the king.
   When the pope hesitated to proceed against the unfortunate order, the
   king beset him with the case of Boniface VIII. To save the memory of
   his predecessor, the pope surrendered the lives of the knights. [109]
   Dante, in representing the Templars as victims of the king's avarice,
   compares Philip to Pontius Pilate.


   "I see the modern Pilate, whom avails

   No cruelty to sate and who, unbidden,

   Into the Temple sets his greedy sails."

   Purgatory, xx. 91.

   The house of the Templars in Paris was turned into a royal residence,
   from which Louis XVI., more than four centuries later, went forth to
   the scaffold.

   The Council of Vienne, the fifteenth in the list of the oecumenical
   councils, met Oct. 16, 1311, and after holding three sessions adjourned
   six months later, May 6, 1812. Clement opened it with an address on
   Psalm 111:1, 2, and designated three subjects for its consideration,
   the case of the order of the Templars, the relief of the Holy Land and
   Church reform. The documents bearing on the council are defective.
   [110] In addition to the decisions concerning the Templars and Boniface
   VIII., it condemned the Beguines and Beghards and listened to charges
   made against the Franciscan, Peter John Olivi (d. 1298). Olivi belonged
   to the Spiritual wing of the order. His books had been ordered burnt,
   1274, by one Franciscan general, and a second general of the order,
   Bonagratia, 1279, had appointed a commission which found thirty-four
   dangerous articles in his writings. The council, without pronouncing
   against Olivi, condemned three articles ascribed to him bearing on the
   relation of the two parties in the Franciscan order, the Spirituals and
   Conventuals.

   The council has a place in the history of biblical scholarship and
   university education by its act ordering two chairs each, of Hebrew,
   Arabic, and Chaldee established in Paris, Oxford, Bologna, and
   Salamanca.

   While the proceedings against Boniface and the Templars were dragging
   on in their slow course in France, Clement was trying to make good his
   authority in Italy. Against Venice he hurled the most violent anathemas
   and interdicts for venturing to lay hands on Ferrara, whose territory
   was claimed by the Apostolic See. A crusade was preached against the
   sacrilegious city. She was defeated in battle, and Ferrara was
   committed to the administration of Robert, king of Naples, as the
   pope's vicar.

   All that he could well do, Clement did to strengthen the hold of France
   on the papacy. The first year of his pontificate he appointed 9 French
   cardinals, and of the 24 persons whom he honored with the purple, 23
   were Frenchmen. He granted to the insatiable Philip a Church tithe for
   five years. Next to the fulfilment of his obligations to this monarch,
   Clement made it his chief business to levy tributes upon ecclesiastics
   of all grades and upon vacant Church livings. [111] He was prodigal
   with offices to his relatives. This was a leading feature of his
   pontificate. Five of his kin were made cardinals, three being still in
   their youth. His brother he made rector of Rome, and other members of
   his family received Ancona, Ferrara, the duchy of Spoleto, and the
   duchy of Venaissin, and other territories within the pope's gift. [112]
   The administration and disposition of his treasure occupied a large
   part of Clement's time and have offered an interesting subject to the
   pen of the modern Jesuit scholar, Ehrle. The papal treasure left by
   Clement's predecessor, after being removed from Perugia to France, was
   taken from place to place and castle to castle, packed in coffers laden
   on the backs of mules. After Clement's death, the vast sums he had
   received and accumulated suddenly disappeared. Clement's successor,
   John XXII., instituted a suit against Clement's most trusted relatives
   to account for the moneys. The suit lasted from 1318-1322, and brought
   to light a great amount of information concerning Clement's finances.
   [113]

   His fortune Clement disposed of by will, 1312, the total amount being
   814,000 florins; 300,000 were given to his nephew, the viscount of
   Lomagne and Auvillars, a man otherwise known for his numerous
   illegitimate offspring. This sum was to be used for a crusade; 314,000
   were bequeathed to other relatives and to servants. The remaining
   200,000 were given to churches, convents, and the poor. A loan of
   160,000 made to the king of France was never paid back. [114]

   Clement's body was by his appointment buried at Uzeste. His treasure
   was plundered. At the trial instituted by John XXII., it appeared that
   Clement before his death had set apart 70,000 florins to be divided in
   equal shares between his successor and the college of cardinals. The
   viscount of Lomagne was put into confinement by John, and turned over
   300,000 florins, one-half going to the cardinals and one-half to the
   pope. A few months after Clement's death, the count made loans to the
   king of France of 110,000 florins and to the king of England of 60,000.

   Clement's relatives showed their appreciation of his liberality by
   erecting to his memory an elaborate sarcophagus at Uzeste, which cost
   50,000 gold florins. The theory is that the pope administers moneys
   coming to him by virtue of his papal office for the interest of the
   Church at large. Clement spoke of the treasure in his coffers as his
   own, which he might dispose of as he chose. [115]

   Clement's private life was open to the grave suspicion of unlawful
   intimacy with the beautiful Countess Brunissenda of Foix. Of all the
   popes of the fourteenth century, he showed the least independence. An
   apologist of Boniface VIII., writing in 1308, recorded this judgment:
   [116] "The Lord permitted Clement to be elected, who was more concerned
   about temporal things and in enriching his relatives than was Boniface,
   in order that by contrast Boniface might seem worthy of praise where he
   would otherwise have been condemned, just as the bitter is not known
   except by the sweet, or cold except by heat, or the good except by
   evil." Villani, who assailed both popes, characterized Clement "as
   licentious, greedy of money, a simoniac, who sold in his court every
   benefice for gold." [117]

   By a single service did this pope seem to place the Church in debt to
   his pontificate. The book of decretals, known as the Clementines, and
   issued in part by him, was completed by his successor, John XXII.

   [85] Ferretus of Vicenza, Muratori, IX. 1013. Villani, VIII. 80. As an
   example of Benedict's sanctity it was related that after he was made
   pope he was visited by his mother, dressed in silks, but he refused to
   recognize her till she had changed her dress, and then he embraced her.

   [86] See Pastor, I. 75-80. He calls Clement's decision to remain in
   France der unselige Entschluss, "the unholy resolve," and says the
   change to Avignon had the meaning of a calamity and a fall, die
   Bedeutung einer Katastrophe, eines Sturzes. Hefele-Knöpfler,
   Kirchengeschichte, p. 458, pronounces it "a move full of bad omen."
   Baur, Kirchengesch. d. M. A., p. 265, said, "The transference of the
   papal chair to Avignon was the fatal turning-point from which the
   papacy moved on to its dramatic goal with hasty step." See also Haller,
   p. 23. Pastor, p. 62, making out as good a case as he can for the
   Avignon popes, lays stress upon the support they gave to missions in
   Asia and Africa. Clement VI., 1342-1352, appointed an archbishop for
   Japan.

   [87] Petrarch speaks of it "as filled with every kind of confusion, the
   powers of darkness overspreading it and containing everything fearful
   which had ever existed or been imagined by a disordered mind."
   Robinson: Petrarch, p. 87. Pastor, I. p. 76, seeks to reduce the value
   of Petrarch's testimony on the ground that he spoke as a poet, burning
   with the warm blood of his country, who, notwithstanding his charges,
   preferred to live in Avignon.

   [88] The children did not escape the violence of this mad frenzy. The
   little child, Agapito Colonna, was found in the church, where it had
   been taken by the servant, strangled by the Orsini.

   [89] Pastor, p. 78, with note.

   [90] John XXII. paid off the cost incurred for this restoration with
   the price of silver vessels left by Clement V. for the relief of the
   churches in Rome. See Ehrle, V. 131.

   [91] See Finke: Quellen, p. 92.

   [92] Döllinger says Clement passed completely into the service of the
   king, er trat ganz in den Dienst des Königs. Akad. Vorträge, III. 254.

   [93] Mansi was the first to express doubts concerning these articles,
   reported by Villani, VIII. 80. Döllinger: Akad. Vorträge, III. 254, and
   Hefele, following Bouteric, deny them altogether. Hefele, in a long and
   careful statement, VI. 394-403, gives reasons for regarding them as an
   Italian invention. Clement distinctly said that he knew nothing of the
   charges against the Templars till the day of his coronation. On the
   other hand, Villani's testimony is clear and positive, and at any rate
   shows the feeling which prevailed in the early part of the fourteenth
   century. Archer is inclined to hold on to Villani's testimony, Enc.
   Brit., XXIII. 164. The character of pope and king, and the
   circumstances under which Clement was elected, make a compact
   altogether probable.

   [94] Dupuy, pp. 448-465. See Finke and Scholz, pp. 198-207. Among those
   who took sides against the pope was Peter Dubois. In his Deliberatio
   super agendis a Philippo IV. (Dupuy, pp. 44-47), he pronounced Boniface
   a heretic. This tract was probably written during the sessions of the
   National Assembly in Paris, April, 1302. See Scholz, p. 386. In another
   tract Dubois (Dupuy, pp. 214-19) called upon the French king to condemn
   Boniface as a heretic.

   [95] This is upon the basis of a tractate found and published by Finke,
   Aus den Tagen Bon. VIII., pp. lxix-c, and which he puts in the year
   1308. See pp. lxxxv, xcviii. Scholz, p. 174, ascribes this tract to
   Augustinus Triumphus.

   [96] Holtzmann: W. von Nogaret, p. 202 sqq.

   [97] The tract of 1308 attempts to prove some of the charges against
   Boniface untrue, or that true sayings attributed to him did not make
   him a heretic. For example, it takes up the charges that Boniface had
   called the Gauls dogs, and had said he would rather be a dog than a
   Gaul. The argument begins by quoting Eccles. 3:19, p. lxx. sqq.

   [98] The condemned clauses were in some cases erased, but Boniface's
   friends succeeded in keeping some perfect copies of the originals. See
   Hefele-Knöpfler, VI. 460.

   [99] Döllinger's treatment, Akad. Vorträge, III. 244-274, was the last
   address that distinguished historian made before the Munich Academy of
   the Sciences. In his zeal to present a good case for the Templars, he
   suggests that if they had been let alone they might have done good
   service by policing the Mediterranean, with Cyprus as a base.

   [100] In the bull Pastoralis praeeminentiae, 1307. Augustinus
   Triumphus, in his tract on the Templars, de facto Templarorum, without
   denying the charges of heresy, denied the king's right to seize and try
   persons accused of heresy on his own initiative and without the
   previous consent of the Church. See the document printed by Scholz, pp.
   508-516.

   [101] It consisted of the archbishop of Narbonne, the bishops of Mende,
   Bayeux, and Limoges and four lesser dignitaries. The place of sitting
   was put at Paris at the urgency of Philip.

   [102] In the bull Faciens misericordiam. In this document the pope made
   the charge that the grand-master and the officers of the order were in
   the habit of granting absolution, a strictly priestly prerogative. It
   was to confirm the strict view of granting absolution that Alexander
   III. provided for the admission of priests to the Military Orders. See
   Lea's valuable paper. The Absolution Formula of the Templars. See also
   on this subject Finke I. 395-397. Funk, p. 1330, saysder Pabst kam von
   jetzt an dem König mehr und mehr entgegen und nachdem er sich von dem
   gewaltigsten und rücksichtsiosigsten Fürsten seiner Zeit hatte ungarnen
   lassen, war ein Entkommen aus seiner Gewalt kaum mehr möglich

   [103] These practices have been regarded by Prutz, Loiscleur (La
   doctrine secrète des Templiers, Paris, 1872) and others as a part of a
   secret code which came into use in the thirteenth century. But the code
   has not been forthcoming and was not referred to in the trials.
   Frederick II. declared that the Templars received Mohammedans into
   their house at Jerusalem and preferred their religious rites. This
   statement must be taken with reserve, in view of Frederick's hostility
   to the order for its refusal to help him on his crusade. See M. Paris,
   an. 1244.

   [104] At the trial before the bishop of Nismes in 1309, out of 32, all
   but three denied the charges. At Perpignan, 1310, the whole number, 26,
   denied the charges. At Clermont 40 confessed the order guilty, 28
   denied its guilt. With such antagonistic testimonies it is difficult,
   if at all possible, to decide the question of guilt or innocence.

   [105] Per viam provisionis seu ordinationis apostolicae is the language
   of the bull, that is, as opposed to de jure or as a punishment for
   proven crimes. This bull, Vox clamantis, was found by the Benedictine,
   Dr. Gams, in Spain, in 1865. See Hefele-Knöpfler, VI. 625 sqq. It is
   found in Mirbt: Quellen, p. 149 sq. Clement asserts he issued the order
   of abolition "not without bitterness and pain of heart," non sine
   cordis amaritudine et dolore. Two other bulls on the Templars and the
   disposition of their property followed in May.

   [106] The wealth of the Templars has been greatly exaggerated. They
   were not richer in France than the Hospitallers. About 1300 the
   possessions of each of these orders in that country were taxed at 6000
   pounds. See Döllinger, p. 267 sq. Thomas Fuller, the English historian,
   quaintly says, "Philip would never have taken away the Templars' lives
   if he might have taken away their lands without putting them to death.
   He could not get the honey without burning the bees." The Spanish
   delegation to the Council of Vienne wrote back to the king of Aragon
   that the chief concern at the council and with the king in regard to
   the Templars was the disposition of their goods, Finke, I. 360, 374.
   Finke, I. 111, 115, etc., ascribes a good deal of the animosity against
   the order to the revelations made by Esquin de Floyran to Jayme of
   Aragon in 1306. But the charges he made were already current in France.

   [107] In 1609 the benchers of the Inner and Middle Temple received the
   buildings for a small annual payment to the Crown, into whose
   possession they had passed under Henry VIII.

   [108] Dante and Villani agree that the Templars were innocent. In this
   judgment most modern historians concur. Funk declares the sentence of
   innocence to be "without question the right one," p. 1341. Döllinger,
   with great emphasis, insists that nowhere did a Templar make a
   confession of guilt except under torture, p. 257. More recently, 1907,
   Finke (I. p. ix. 326 sq. 337) insists upon their innocence and the
   untrustworthiness of the confessions made by the Templars. He declares
   that he who advocates their guilt must accept the appearances of the
   devil as a tom-cat. Prutz, in his earlier works, decided for their
   guilt. Schottmüller, Döllinger, Funk, and our own Dr. Lea strongly
   favor their innocence. Ranke: Univ. Hist., VIII. 622, wavers and
   ascribes to them the doctrinal standpoint of Frederick II. and Manfred.
   In France, Michelet was against the order; Michaud, Guizot, Renan and
   Boutaric for it. Hallam: Middle Ages, I. 142-146, is undecided.

   [109] See Döllinger, p. 255, and Gregorovius. Lea gives as excuse for
   the length at which he treats the trial and fate of the unfortunate
   knights, their helplessness before the Inquisition.

   [110] Ehrle,Archiv für Lit. und Kirchengesch. IV. 361-470, published a
   fragmentary report which he discovered in the National Library in
   Paris. For the best account of the proceedings, see Hefele-Knöpfler,

   [111] Haller, p. 46 sqq.

   [112] Ehrle, V. 139 sq.

   [113] Ehrle, p. 147, calculates that Clement's yearly income was
   between 200,000 and 250,000 gold florins, and that of this amount he
   spent 100,000 for the expenses of his court and saved the remainder,
   100,000 or 160,000. Ehrle, p. 149, gives Clement's family tree.

   [114] Ehrle, pp. 126, 135.

   Calvinists in 1568 or 1577. See Ehrle, p. 139.

   [117] Chronicle, IX. 59. Villani tells the story that at the death of
   one of Clement's nephews, a cardinal, Clement, in his desire to see
   him, consulted a necromancer. The master of the dark arts had one of
   the pope's chaplains conducted by demons to hell, where he was shown a
   palace, and in it the nephew's soul laid on a bed of glowing fire, and
   near by a place reserved for the pope himself. He also relates that the
   coffin, in which Clement was laid, was burnt, and with it the pope's
   body up to the waist.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 7. The Pontificate of John XXII 1316-1334.

   Clement died April 20, 1314. The cardinals met at Carpentras and then
   at Lyons, and after an interregnum of twenty seven months elected John
   XXII., 1316-1334, to the papal throne. He was then seventy-two, and
   cardinal-bishop of Porto. [118] Dante had written to the conclave
   begging that it elect an Italian pope, but the French influence was
   irresistible.

   Said to be the son of a cobbler of Cahors, short of stature, [119] with
   a squeaking voice, industrious and pedantic, John was, upon the whole,
   the most conspicuous figure among the popes of the fourteenth century,
   though not the most able or worthy one. He was a man of restless
   disposition, and kept the papal court in constant commotion. The
   Vatican Archives preserve 59 volumes of his bulls and other writings.
   He had been a tutor in the house of Anjou, and carried the preceptorial
   method into his papal utterances. It was his ambition to be a
   theologian as well as pope. He solemnly promised the Italian faction in
   the curia never to mount an ass except to start on the road to Rome.
   But he never left Avignon. His devotion to France was shown at the very
   beginning of his reign in the appointment of eight cardinals, of whom
   seven were Frenchmen.

   The four notable features of John's pontificate are his quarrel with
   the German emperor, Lewis the Bavarian, his condemnation of the rigid
   party of the Franciscans, his own doctrinal heresy, and his cupidity
   for gold.

   The struggle with Lewis the Bavarian was a little afterplay compared
   with the imposing conflicts between the Hohenstaufen and the notable
   popes of preceding centuries. Europe looked on with slight interest at
   the long-protracted dispute, which was more adapted to show the
   petulance and weakness of both emperor and pope than to settle
   permanently any great principle. At Henry VII.'s death, 1313, five of
   the electors gave their votes for Lewis of the house of Wittelsbach,
   and two for Frederick of Hapsburg. Both appealed to the new pope, about
   to be elected. Frederick was crowned by the archbishop of Treves at
   Bonn, and Lewis by the archbishop of Mainz at Aachen. In 1317 John
   declared that the pope was the lawful vicar of the empire so long as
   the throne was vacant, and denied Lewis recognition as king of the
   Romans on the ground of his having neglected to submit his election to
   him.

   The battle at Mühldorf, 1322, left Frederick a prisoner in his rival's
   hands. This turn of affairs forced John to take more decisive action,
   and in 1323 was issued against Lewis the first of a wearisome and
   repetitious series of complaints and punishments from Avignon. The pope
   threatened him with the ban, claiming authority to approve or set aside
   an emperor's election. [120] A year later he excommunicated Lewis and
   all his supporters.

   In answer to this first complaint of 1323, Lewis made a formal
   declaration at Nürnberg in the presence of a notary and other witnesses
   that he regarded the empire as independent of the pope, charged John
   with heresy, and appealed to a general council. The charge of heresy
   was based on the pope's treatment of the Spiritual party among the
   Franciscans. Condemned by John, prominent Spirituals, Michael of
   Cesena, Ockam and Bonagratia, espoused Lewis' cause, took refuge at his
   court, and defended him with their pens. The political conflict was
   thus complicated by a recondite ecclesiastical problem. In 1324 Lewis
   issued a second appeal, written in the chapel of the Teutonic Order in
   Sachsenhausen, which again renewed the demand for a general council and
   repeated the charge of heresy against the pope.

   The next year, 1325, Lewis suffered a severe defeat from Leopold of
   Austria, who had entered into a compact to put Charles IV. of France on
   the German throne. He went so far as to express his readiness, in the
   compact of Ulm, 1326, to surrender the German crown to Frederick,
   provided he himself was confirmed in his right to Italy and the
   imperial dignity. At this juncture Leopold died.

   By papal appointment Robert of Naples was vicar of Rome. But Lewis had
   no idea of surrendering his claims to Italy, and, now that he was once
   again free by Leopold's death, he marched across the Alps and was
   crowned, January 1327, emperor in front of St. Peter's. Sciarra
   Colonna, as the representative of the people, placed the crown on his
   head, and two bishops administered unction. Villani [121] expresses
   indignation at an imperial coronation conducted without the pope's
   consent as a thing unheard of. Lewis was the first mediaeval emperor
   crowned by the people. A formal trial was instituted, and "James of
   Cahors, who calls himself John XXII." was denounced as anti-christ and
   deposed from the papal throne and his effigy carried through the
   streets and burnt. [122] John of Corbara, belonging to the Spiritual
   wing of the Franciscans, was elected to the throne just declared
   vacant, and took the name of Nicolas V. He was the first anti-pope
   since the days of Barbarossa. Lewis himself placed the crown upon the
   pontiff's head, and the bishop of Venice performed the ceremony of
   unction. Nicolas surrounded himself with a college of seven cardinals,
   and was accused of having forthwith renounced the principles of poverty
   and abstemiousness in dress and at the table which the day before he
   had advocated.

   To these acts of violence John replied by pronouncing Lewis a heretic
   and appointing a crusade against him, with the promise of indulgence to
   all taking part in it. Fickle Rome soon grew weary of her lay-crowned
   emperor, who had been so unwise as to impose an extraordinary tribute
   of 10,000 florins each upon the people, the clergy, and the Jews of the
   city. He retired to the North, Nicolas following him with his retinue
   of cardinals. At Pisa, the emperor being present, the anti-pope
   excommunicated John and summoned a general council to Milan. John was
   again burnt in effigy, at the cathedral, and condemned to death for
   heresy. In 1330 Lewis withdrew from Italy altogether, while Nicolas,
   with a cord around his neck, submitted to John. He died in Avignon
   three years later. In 1334, John issued a bull which, according to Karl
   Müller, was the rudest act of violence done up to that time to the
   German emperor by a pope. [123] This fulmination separated Italy from
   the crown and kingdom--imperium et regnum -- of Germany and forbade
   their being reunited in one body. The reason given for this drastic
   measure was the territorial separation of the two provinces. Thus was
   accomplished by a distinct announcement what the diplomacy of Innocent
   III. was the first to make a part of the papal policy, and which
   figured so prominently in the struggle between Gregory IX. and
   Frederick II.

   With his constituency completely lost in Italy, and with only an
   uncertain support in Germany, Lewis now made overtures for peace. But
   the pope was not ready for anything less than a full renunciation of
   the imperial power. John died 1334, but the struggle was continued
   through the pontificate of his successor, Benedict XII. Philip VI. of
   France set himself against Benedict's measures for reconciliation with
   Lewis, and in 1337 the emperor made an alliance with England against
   France. Princes of Germany, making the rights of the empire their own,
   adopted the famous constitution of Rense,--a locality near Mainz, which
   was confirmed at the Diet of Frankfurt, 1338. It repudiated the pope's
   extravagant temporal claims, and declared that the election of an
   emperor by the electors was final, and did not require papal approval.
   This was the first representative German assembly to assert the
   independence of the empire.

   The interdict was hanging over the German assembly when Benedict died,
   1342. The battle had gone against Lewis, and his supporters were
   well-nigh all gone from him. A submission even more humiliating than
   that of Henry IV. was the only thing left. He sought the favor of
   Clement VI., but in vain. In a bull of April 12, 1343, Clement
   enumerated the emperor's many crimes, and anew ordered him to renounce
   the imperial dignity. Lewis wrote, yielding submission, but the
   authenticity of the document was questioned at Avignon, probably with
   the set purpose of increasing the emperor's humiliation. Harder
   conditions were laid down. They were rejected by the diet at Frankfurt,
   1344. But Germany was weary, and listened without revulsion to a final
   bull against Lewis, 1346, and a summons to the electors to proceed to a
   new election. The electors, John of Bohemia among them, chose Charles
   IV., John's son. The Bohemian king was the blind warrior who met his
   death on the battlefield of Crécy the same year. Before his election,
   Charles had visited Avignon, and promised full submission to the pope's
   demands. His continued complacency during his reign justified the
   pope's choice. The struggle was ended with Lewis' death a year later,
   1347, while he was engaged near Munich in a bear-hunt. It was the last
   conflict of the empire and papacy along the old lines laid down by
   those ecclesiastical warriors, Hildebrand and Innocent III. and Gregory
   IX.

   To return to John XXII., he became a prominent figure in the
   controversy within the Franciscan order over the tenure of property, a
   controversy which had been going on from the earliest period between
   the two parties, the Spirituals, or Observants, and the Conventuals.
   The last testament of St. Francis, pleading for the practice of
   absolute poverty, and suppressed in Bonaventura's Life of the saint,
   1263, was not fully recognized in the bull of Nicolas III., 1279, which
   granted the Franciscans the right to use property as tenants, while
   forbidding them to hold it in fee simple. With this decision the strict
   party, the Spirituals, were not satisfied, and the struggle went on.
   Coelestine V. attempted to bring peace by merging the Spiritual wing
   with the order of Hermits he had founded, but the measure was without
   success.

   Under Boniface VIII. matters went hard with the Spirituals. This pope
   deposed the general, Raymond Gaufredi, putting in his place John of
   Murro, who belonged to the laxer wing. Peter John Olivi (d. 1298),
   whose writings were widely circulated, had declared himself in favor of
   Nicolas' bull, with the interpretation that the use of property and
   goods was to be the "use of necessity,"--usus pauper,--as opposed to
   the more liberal use advocated by the Conventuals and called usus
   moderatus. Olivi's personal fortunes were typical of the fortunes of
   the Spiritual branch. After his death, the attack made against his
   memory was, if possible, more determined, and culminated in the charges
   preferred at Vienne. Murro adopted violent measures, burning Olivi's
   writings, and casting his sympathizers into prison. Other prominent
   Spirituals fled. Angelo Clareno found refuge for a time in Greece,
   returning to Rome, 1305, under the protection of the Colonna.

   The case was formally taken up by Clement V., who called a commission
   to Avignon to devise measures to heal the division, and gave the
   Spirituals temporary relief from persecution. The proceedings were
   protracted till the meeting of the council in Vienne, when the
   Conventuals brought up the case in the form of an arraignment of Olivi,
   who had come to be regarded almost as a saint. Among the charges were
   that he pronounced the usus pauper to be of the essence of the Minorite
   rule, that Christ was still living at the time the lance was thrust
   into his side, and that the rational soul has not the form of a body.
   Olivi's memory was defended by Ubertino da Casale, and the council
   passed no sentence upon his person.

   In the bull Exivi de paradiso, [124] issued 1813, and famous in the
   history of the Franciscan order, Clement seemed to take the side of the
   Spirituals. It forbade the order or any of its members to accept
   bequests, possess vineyards, sell products from their gardens, build
   fine churches, or go to law. It permitted only "the use of necessity,"
   usus arctus or pauper, and nothing beyond. The Minorites were to wear
   no shoes, ride only in cases of necessity, fast from Nov. 1 until
   Christmas, as well as every Friday, and possess a single mantle with a
   hood and one without a hood. Clement ordered the new general, Alexander
   of Alessandra, to turn over to Olivi's followers the convents of
   Narbonne, Carcassonne and Béziers, but also ordered the Inquisition to
   punish the Spirituals who refused submission.

   In spite of the papal decree, the controversy was still being carried
   on within the order with great heat, when John XXII. came to the
   throne. In the decretal Quorumdam exegit, and in the bull Sancta romana
   et universalis ecclesia, Dec. 30, 1317, John took a positive position
   against the Spirituals. A few weeks later, he condemned a formal list
   of their errors and abolished all the convents under Spiritual
   management. From this time on dates the application of the name
   Fraticelli [125] to the Spirituals. They refused to submit, and took
   the position that even a pope had no right to modify the Rule of St.
   Francis. Michael of Cesena, the general of the order, defended them.
   Sixty-four of their number were summoned to Avignon. Twenty-five
   refused to yield, and passed into the hands of the Inquisition. Four
   were burnt as martyrs at Marseilles, May 7, 1318. Others fled to
   Sicily. [126]

   The chief interest of the controversy was now shifted to the strictly
   theological question whether Christ and his Apostles observed complete
   poverty. This dispute threatened to rend the wing of the Conventuals
   itself. Michael of Cesena, Ockam, and others, took the position that
   Christ and his Apostles not only held no property as individuals, but
   held none in common. John, opposing this view, gave as arguments the
   gifts of the Magi, that Christ possessed clothes and bought food, the
   purse of Judas, and Paul's labor for a living. In the bull Cum inter
   nonnullos, 1323, and other bulls, John declared it heresy to hold that
   Christ and the Apostles held no possessions. Those who resisted this
   interpretation were pronounced, 1324, rebels and heretics. John went
   farther, and gave back to the order the right of possessing goods in
   fee simple, a right which Innocent IV. had denied, and he declared that
   in things which disappear in the using, such as eatables, no
   distinction can be made between their use and their possession. In 1326
   John pronounced Olivi's commentary on the Apocalypse heretical. The
   three Spiritual leaders, Cesena, Ockam, and Bonagratia were seized and
   held in prison until 1328, when they escaped and fled to Lewis the
   Bavarian at Pisa. It was at this time that Ockam was said to have used
   to the emperor the famous words, "Do thou defend me with the sword and
   I will defend thee with the pen"--tu me depfendes gladio, ego te
   defendam calamo. They were deposed from their offices and included in
   the ban fulminated against the anti-pope, Peter of Corbara. Later,
   Cesena submitted to the pope, as Ockam is also said to have done
   shortly before his death. Cesena died at Munich, 1342 He committed the
   seal of the order to Ockam. On his death-bed he is said to have cried
   out: "My God, what have I done? I have appealed against him who is the
   highest on the earth. But look, O Father, at the spirit of truth that
   is in me which has not erred through the lust of the flesh but from
   great zeal for the seraphic order and out of love for poverty."
   Bonagratia also died in Munich. [127]

   Later in the fourteenth century the Regular Observance grew again to
   considerable proportions, and in the beginning of the fifteenth century
   its fame was revived by the flaming preachers Bernardino of Siena and
   John of Capistrano. The peace of the Franciscan order continued to be
   the concern of pope after pope until, in 1517, Leo X. terminated the
   struggle of three centuries by formally recognizing two distinct
   societies within the Franciscan body. The moderate wing was placed
   under the Master-General of the Conventual Minorite Brothers, and was
   confirmed in the right to hold property. The strict or Observant wing
   was placed under a Minister-General of the Whole Order of St. Francis.
   [128] The latter takes precedence in processions and at other great
   functions, and holds his office for six years.

   If the Spiritual Franciscans had been capable of taking secret delight
   in an adversary's misfortunes, they would have had occasion for it in
   the widely spread charge that John was a heretic. At any rate, he came
   as near being a heretic as a pope can be. His heresy concerned the
   nature of the beatific vision after death. In a sermon on All Souls',
   1331, he announced that the blessed dead do not see God until the
   general resurrection. In at least two more sermons he repeated this
   utterance. John, who was much given to theologizing, Ockam declared to
   be wholly ignorant in theology. [129] This Schoolman, Cesena, and
   others pronounced the view heretical. John imprisoned an English
   Dominican who preached against him, and so certain was he of his case
   that he sent the Franciscan general, Gerardus Odonis, to Paris to get
   the opinion of the university.

   The King, Philip VI., took a warm interest in the subject, opposed the
   pope, and called a council of theologians at Vincennes to give its
   opinion. It decided that ever since the Lord descended into hades and
   released souls from that abode, the righteous have at death immediately
   entered upon the vision of the divine essence of the Trinity. [130]
   Among the supporters of this decision was Nicolas of Lyra. When
   official announcement of the decision reached the pope, he summoned a
   council at Avignon and set before it passages from the Fathers for and
   against his view. They sat for five days, in December, 1333. John then
   made a public announcement, which was communicated to the king and
   queen of France, that he had not intended to say anything in conflict
   with the Fathers and the orthodox Church and, if he had done so, he
   retracted his utterances.

   The question was authoritatively settled by Benedict XII. in the bull
   Benedictus deus, 1336, which declared that the blessed dead--saints,
   the Apostles, virgins, martyrs, confessors who need no purgatorial
   cleansing--are, after death and before the resurrection of their bodies
   at the general judgment, with Christ and the angels, and that they
   behold the divine essence with naked vision. [131] Benedict declared
   that John died while he was preparing a decision.

   The financial policy of John XXII. and his successors merits a chapter
   by itself. Here reference may be made to John's private fortune. He has
   had the questionable fame of not only having amassed a larger sum than
   any of his predecessors, but of having died possessed of fabulous
   wealth. Gregorovius calls him the Midas of Avignon. According to
   Villani, he left behind him 18,000,000 gold florins and 7,000,000
   florins' worth of jewels and ornaments, in all 25,000,000 florins, or
   $60,000,000 of our present coinage. This chronicler concludes with the
   remark that the words were no longer remembered which the Good Man in
   the Gospels spake to his disciples, "Lay up for yourselves treasure in
   heaven." [132] Recent investigations seem to cast suspicion upon this
   long-held view as an exaggeration. John's hoard may have amounted to
   not more than 750,000 florins, or $2,000,000 [133] of our money. If
   this be a safe estimate, it is still true that John was a shrewd
   financier and perhaps the richest man in Europe.

   When John died he was ninety years old.

   weary of their inability to make a choice, left it to John. Following
   the advice of Cardinal Napoleon Orsini, he grasped his supreme chance
   and elected himself. He was crowned at Lyons.

   [119] Villani's statement that he was the son of a cobbler is doubted.

   [122] The grounds on which John was deposed were his decisions against
   the Spirituals, the use of money and ships, intended for a crusade, to
   reduce Genoa, appropriation of the right of appointment to clerical
   offices, and his residence away from Rome. The document is found in

   florins besides other "unrecorded treasure." This writer adds, the
   world did not have a richer Christian in it than John XXII.

   [133] This is the figure reached by Ehrle, Die 25 Millionen im Schatz
   Johann XXII., Archiv, 1889, pp. 155-166. It is based upon the contents
   of 15 coffers, opened in the year 1342 at the death of Benedict XII.
   These coffers contained John's treasure, and at that time yielded
   750,000 florins. But it is manifestly uncertain how far John's savings
   had been reduced by Benedict, or whether these coffers were all that
   were left by John. For example, at his consecration, Benedict gave
   100,000 florins to his cardinals, and 150,000 to the churches at Rome,
   and it is quite likely he drew upon John's hoard. The gold mitres,
   rings, and other ornaments which John's thrift amassed, were stored in
   other chests. Villani got his report from his brother, a Florentine
   banker in the employ of the curia at Avignon. It is difficult to
   understand how, in making his statement, he should have gone so wide of
   the truth as Ehrle suggests.

   § 8. The Papal Office Assailed.

   To the pontificate of John XXII. belongs a second group of literary
   assailants of the papacy. Going beyond Dante and John of Paris, they
   attacked the pope's spiritual functions. Their assaults were called
   forth by the conflict with Lewis the Bavarian and the controversy with
   the Franciscan Spirituals. Lewis' court became a veritable nest of
   antipapal agitation and the headquarters of pamphleteering. Marsiglius
   of Padua was the cleverest and boldest of these writers, Ockam--a
   Schoolman rather than a practical thinker--the most copious. Michael of
   Cesena [134] and Bonagratia also made contributions to this literature.

   Ockam sets forth his views in two works, The Dialogue and the Eight
   Questions. The former is ponderous in thought and a monster in size.
   [135] It is difficult, if at times possible, to detect the author's
   views in the mass of cumbersome disputation. These views seem to be as
   follows: The papacy is not an institution which is essential to the
   being of the Church. Conditions arise to make it necessary to establish
   national churches. [136] The pope is not infallible. Even a legitimate
   pope may hold to heresy. So it was with Peter, who was judaizing, and
   had to be rebuked by Paul, Liberius, who was an Arian, and Leo, who was
   arraigned for false doctrine by Hilary of Poictiers. Sylvester II. made
   a compact with the devil. One or the other, Nicolas III. or John XXII.,
   was a heretic, for the one contradicted the other. A general council
   may err just as popes have erred. So did the second Council of Lyons
   and the Council of Vienne, which condemned the true Minorites. The pope
   may be pronounced a heretic by a council or, if a council fails in its
   duty, the cardinals may pronounce the decision. In case the cardinals
   fail, the right to do so belongs to the temporal prince. Christ did not
   commit the faith to the pope and the hierarchy, but to the Church, and
   somewhere within the Church the truth is always held and preserved.
   Temporal power did not originally belong to the pope. This is proved by
   Constantine's donation, for what Constantine gave, he gave for the
   first time. Supreme power in temporal and spiritual things is not in a
   single hand. The emperor has full power by virtue of his election, and
   does not depend for it upon unction or coronation by the pope or any
   earthly confirmation of any kind.

   More distinct and advanced were the utterances of Marsiglius of Padua.
   His writings abound in incisive thrusts against the prevailing
   ecclesiastical system, and lay down the principles of a new order. In
   the preparation of his chief work, the Defence of the Faith,--Defensor
   pacis,--he had the help of John of Jandun. [137] Both writers were
   clerics, but neither of them monks. Born about 1270 in Padua,
   Marsiglius devoted himself to the study of medicine, and in 1312 was
   rector of the University of Paris. In 1325 or 1326 he betook himself to
   the court of Lewis the Bavarian. The reasons are left to surmisal. He
   acted as the emperor's physician. In 1328 he accompanied the emperor to
   Rome, and showed full sympathy with the measures taken to establish the
   emperor's authority. He joined in the ceremonies of the emperor's
   coronation, the deposition of John XXII. and the elevation of the
   anti-pope, Peter of Corbara. The pope had already denounced Marsiglius
   and John of Jandun [138] as "sons of perdition, the sons of Belial,
   those pestiferous individuals, beasts from the abyss," and summoned the
   Romans to make them prisoners. Marsiglius was made vicar of Rome by the
   emperor, and remained true to the principles stated in his tract, even
   when the emperor became a suppliant to the Avignon court. Lewis even
   went so far as to express to John XXII. his readiness to withdraw his
   protection from Marsiglius and the leaders of the Spirituals. Later,
   when his position was more hopeful, he changed his attitude and gave
   them his protection at Munich. But again, in his letter submitting
   himself to Clement VI., 1343, the emperor denied holding the errors
   charged against Marsiglius and John, and declared his object in
   retaining them at his court had been to lead them back to the Church.
   The Paduan died before 1343. [139]

   The personal fortunes of Marsiglius are of small historical concern
   compared with his book, which he dedicated to the emperor. The volume,
   which was written in two months, [140] was as audacious as any of the
   earlier writings of Luther. For originality and boldness of statement
   the Middle Ages has nothing superior to offer. To it may be compared in
   modern times Janus' attack on the doctrine of papal infallibility at
   the time of the Vatican Council. [141] Its Scriptural radicalism was in
   itself a literary sensation.

   In condemning the work, John XXII., 1327, pronounced as contrary "to
   apostolic truth and all law" its statements that Christ paid the stater
   to the Roman government as a matter of obligation, that Christ did not
   appoint a vicar, that an emperor has the right to depose a pope, and
   that the orders of the hierarchy are not of primitive origin.
   Marsiglius had not spared epithets in dealing with John, whom he called
   "the great dragon, the old serpent." Clement VI. found no less than 240
   heretical clauses in the book, and declared that he had never read a
   worse heretic than Marsiglius. The papal condemnations were reproduced
   by the University of Paris, which singled out for reprobation the
   statements that Peter is not the head of the Church, that the pope may
   be deposed, and that he has no right to inflict punishments without the
   emperor's consent. [142]

   The Defensor pacis was a manifesto against the spiritual as well as the
   temporal assumptions of the papacy and against the whole hierarchical
   organization of the Church. Its title is shrewdly chosen in view of the
   strifes between cities and states going on at the time the book was
   written, and due, as it claimed, to papal ambition and interference.
   The peace of the Christian world would never be established so long as
   the pope's false claims were accepted. The main positions are the
   following: [143] --

   The state, which was developed out of the family, exists that men may
   live well and peaceably. The people themselves are the source of
   authority, and confer the right to exercise it upon the ruler whom they
   select. The functions of the priesthood are spiritual and educational.
   Clerics are called upon to teach and to warn. In all matters of civil
   misdemeanor they are responsible to the civil officer as other men are.
   They should follow their Master by self-denial. As St. Bernard said,
   the pope needs no wealth or outward display to be a true successor of
   Peter.

   The function of binding and loosing is a declarative, not a judicial,
   function. To God alone belongs the power to forgive sins and to punish.
   No bishop or priest has a right to excommunicate or interdict
   individual freedom without the consent of the people or its
   representative, the civil legislator. The power to inflict punishments
   inheres in the congregation "of the faithful"--fidelium. Christ said,
   "if thy brother offend against thee, tell it to the Church." He did not
   say, tell it to the priest. Heresy may be detected as heresy by the
   priest, but punishment for heresy belongs to the civil official and is
   determined upon the basis of the injury likely to be done by the
   offence to society. According to the teaching of the Scriptures, no one
   can be compelled by temporal punishment and death to observe the
   precepts of the divine law. [144]

   General councils are the supreme representatives of the Christian body,
   but even councils may err. In them laymen should sit as well as
   clerics. Councils alone have the right to canonize saints.

   As for the pope, he is the head of the Church, not by divine
   appointment, but only as he is recognized by the state. The claim he
   makes to fulness of power, plenitudo potestatis, contradicts the true
   nature of the Church. To Peter was committed no greater authority than
   was committed to the other Apostles. [145] Peter can be called the
   Prince of the Apostles only on the ground that he was older than the
   rest or more steadfast than they. He was the bishop of Antioch, not the
   founder of the Roman bishopric. Nor is his presence in Rome susceptible
   of proof. The pre-eminence of the bishop of Rome depends upon the
   location of his see at the capital of the empire. As for sacerdotal
   power, the pope has no more of it than any other cleric, as Peter-had
   no more of it than the other Apostles. [146]

   The grades of the hierarchy are of human origin. Bishops and priests
   were originally equal. Bishops derive their authority immediately from
   Christ.

   False is the pope's claim to jurisdiction over princes and nations, a
   claim which was the fruitful source of national strifes and wars,
   especially in Italy. If necessary, the emperor may depose a pope. This
   is proved by the judgment passed by Pilate upon Christ. The state may,
   for proper reasons, limit the number of clerics. The validity of
   Constantine's donation Marsiglius rejected, as Dante and John of Paris
   had done before, but he did not surmise that the Isidorean decretals
   were an unblushing forgery, a discovery left for Laurentius Valla to
   make a hundred years later.

   As for the Scriptures, Marsiglius declares them to be the ultimate
   source of authority. They do not derive that authority from the Church.
   The Church gets its authority from them. In cases of disputed
   interpretation, it is for a general council to settle what the true
   meaning of Scripture is. [147] Obedience to papal decretals is not a
   condition of salvation. If that were so, how is it that Clement V.
   could make the bull Unam sanctam inoperative for France and its king?
   Did not that bull declare that submission to the pope is for every
   creature a condition of salvation! Can a pope set aside a condition of
   salvation? The case of Liberius proves that popes may be heretics. As
   for the qualifications of bishops, archbishops, and patriarchs, not one
   in ten of them is a doctor of theology. Many of the lower clergy are
   not even acquainted with grammar. Cardinals and popes are chosen not
   from the ranks of theologians, but lawyers, causidici. Youngsters are
   made cardinals who love pleasure and are ignorant in studies.

   Marsiglius quotes repeatedly such passages as "My kingdom is not of
   this world," John 18:36, and "Render unto Caesar the things which are
   Caesar's and to God the things which are God's," Matt. 22:21. These
   passages and others, such as John 6:15, 19:11, Luke 12:14, Matt. 17:27,
   Rom. 13, he opposes to texts which were falsely interpreted to the
   advantage of the hierarchy, such as Matt. 16:19, Luke 22:38, John
   21:15-17.

   If we overlook his doctrine of the supremacy of the state over the
   Church, the Paduan's views correspond closely with those held in
   Protestant Christendom to-day. Christ, he said, excluded his Apostles,
   disciples, and bishops or presbyters from all earthly dominion, both by
   his example and his words. [148] The abiding principles of the Defensor
   are the final authority of the Scriptures, the parity of the priesthood
   and its obligation to civil law, the human origin of the papacy, the
   exclusively spiritual nature of priestly functions, and the body of
   Christian people in the state or Church as the ultimate source of
   authority on earth.

   Marsiglius has been called by Catholic historians the forerunner of
   Luther and Calvin. [149] He has also been called by one of them the
   "exciting genius of modern revolution." [150] Both of these statements
   are not without truth. His programme was not a scheme of reform. It was
   a proclamation of complete change such as the sixteenth century
   witnessed. A note in a Turin manuscript represents Gerson as saying
   that the book is wonderfully well grounded and that the author was most
   expert in Aristotle and also in theology, and went to the roots of
   things. [151]

   The tractarian of Padua and Thomas Aquinas were only 50 years apart.
   But the difference between the searching epigrams of the one and the
   slow, orderly argument of the other is as wide as the East is from the
   West, the directness of modern thought from the cumbersome method of
   mediaeval scholasticism. It never occurred to Thomas Aquinas to think
   out beyond the narrow enclosure of Scripture interpretation built up by
   other Schoolmen and mediaeval popes. He buttressed up the regime he
   found realized before him. He used the old misinterpretations of
   Scripture and produced no new idea on government. Marsiglius,
   independent of the despotism of ecclesiastical dogma, went back to the
   free and elastic principles of the Apostolic Church government. He
   broke the moulds in which the ecclesiastical thinking of centuries had
   been cast, and departed from Augustine in claiming for heretics a
   rational and humane treatment. The time may yet come when the Italian
   people will follow him as the herald of a still better order than that
   which they have, and set aside the sacerdotal theory of the Christian
   ministry as an invention of man. [152]

   Germany furnished a strong advocate of the independent rights of the
   emperor, in Lupold of Bebenburg, who died in 1363. He remained dean of
   Würzburg until he was made bishop of Bamberg in 1353. But he did not
   attack the spiritual jurisdiction of the Apostolic See. Lupold's chief
   work was The Rights of the Kingdom and Empire--de juribus regni et
   imperii,--written after the declarations of Rense. It has been called
   the oldest attempt at a theory of the rights of the German state. [153]
   Lupold appeals to the events of history.

   In defining the rights of the empire, this author asserts that an
   election is consummated by the majority of the electors and that the
   emperor does not stand in need of confirmation by the pope. He holds
   his authority independently from God. Charlemagne exercised imperial
   functions before he was anointed and crowned by Leo. The oath the
   emperor takes to the pope is not the oath of fealty such as a vassal
   renders, but a promise to protect him and the Church. The pope has no
   authority to depose the emperor. His only prerogative is to announce
   that he is worthy of deposition. The right to depose belongs to the
   electors. As for Constantine's donation, it is plain Constantine did
   not confer the rule of the West upon the bishop of Rome, for
   Constantine divided both the West and the East among his sons. Later,
   Theodosius and other emperors exercised dominion in Rome. The notice of
   Constantine's alleged gift to Sylvester has come through the records of
   Sylvester and has the appearance of being apocryphal.

   The papal assailants did not have the field all to themselves. The
   papacy also had vigorous literary champions. Chief among them were
   Augustinus Triumphus and Alvarus Pelagius. [154] The first dedicated
   his leading work to John XXII., and the second wrote at the pope's
   command. The modern reader will find in these tracts the crassest
   exposition of the extreme claims of the papacy, satisfying to the most
   enthusiastic ultramontane, but calling for apology from sober Catholic
   historians. [155]

   Triumphus, an Italian, born in Ancona, 1243, made archbishop of
   Nazareth and died at Naples, 1328, was a zealous advocate of Boniface
   VIII. His leading treatise, The Power of the Church,--Summa de
   potestate ecclesiastica,--vindicates John XXII. for his decision on the
   question of evangelical poverty and for his opposition to the emperor's
   dominion in Italy. [156] The pope has unrestricted power on the earth.
   It is so vast that even he himself cannot know fully what he is able to
   do. [157] His judgment is the judgment of God. Their tribunals are one.
   [158] His power of granting indulgences is so great that, if he so
   wished, he could empty purgatory of its denizens provided that
   conditions were complied with. [159]

   In spiritual matters he may err, because he remains a man, and when he
   holds to heresy, he ceases to be pope. Council cannot depose him nor
   any other human tribunal, for the pope is above all and can be judged
   by none. But, being a heretic, he ceases, ipso facto, to be pope, and
   the condition then is as it would be after one pope is dead and his
   successor not yet elected.

   The pope himself may choose an emperor, if he so please, and may
   withdraw the right of election from the electors or depose them from
   office. As vicar of God, he is above all kings and princes.

   The Spanish Franciscan, Alvarus Pelagius, was not always as extravagant
   as his Augustinian contemporary. [160] He was professor of law at
   Perugia. He fled from Rome at the approach of Lewis the Bavarian, 1328,
   was then appointed papal penitentiary at Avignon, and later bishop of
   the Portuguese diocese of Silves. His Lament over the Church,--de
   planctu ecclesiae, [161] -- while exalting the pope to the skies,
   bewails the low spiritual estate into which the clergy and the Church
   had fallen. Christendom, he argues, which is but one kingdom, can have
   but one head, the pope. Whoever does not accept him as the head does
   not accept Christ. And whosoever, with pure and believing eye, sees the
   pope, sees Christ himself. [162] Without communion with the pope there
   is no salvation. He wields both swords as Christ did, and in him the
   passage of Jer. 1:10 is fulfilled, "I have this day set thee over the
   nations and over the kingdoms to pluck up and to break down, to destroy
   and to overthrow, to build and to plant." Unbelievers, also, Alvarus
   asserts to be legally under the pope's jurisdiction, though they may
   not be so in fact, and the pope may proceed against them as God did
   against the Sodomites. Idolaters, Jews, and Saracens are alike amenable
   to the pope's authority and subject to his punishments. He rules,
   orders, disposes and judges all things as he pleases. His will is
   highest wisdom, and what he pleases to do has the force of law. [163]
   Wherever the supreme pontiff is, there is the Roman Church, and he
   cannot be compelled to remain in Rome. [164] He is the source of all
   law and may decide what is the right. To doubt this means exclusion
   from life eternal.

   As the vicar of Christ, the pope is supreme over the state. He confers
   the sword which the prince wields. As the body is subject to the soul,
   so princes are subject to the pope. Constantine's donation made the
   pope, in fact, monarch over the Occident. He transferred the empire to
   Charlemagne in trust. The emperor's oath is an oath of fealty and
   homage.

   The views of Augustinus Triumphus and Alvarus followed the papal
   assertion and practice of centuries, and the assent or argument of the
   Schoolmen. Marsiglius had the sanction of Scripture rationally
   interpreted, and his views were confirmed by the experiences of
   history. After the lapse of nearly 500 years, opinion in Christendom
   remains divided, and the most extravagant language of Triumphus and
   Alvarus is applauded, and Marsiglius, the exponent of modern liberty
   and of the historical sense of Scripture, continues to be treated as a
   heretic.

   [137] Müller, I. 368, upon the basis of a note in a MS. copy in Vienna,

   John of Jandun's name is associated with the composition of the book in
   the papal bulls. However, the first person singular, ego, is used
   throughout. According to Innocent VI., Marsiglius was much influenced
   by Ockam, then the leading teacher in France. This is inherently
   probable from their personal association in Paris and at the emperor's
   court and the community of many of their views. See Haller, p. 78. John
   of Jandun died probably 1328. See Riezler, p. 56.

   [139] In that year Clement spoke of Marsiglius as dead, Riezler, p.
   122. With Ockam, Marsiglius defended the marriage of Lewis' son to
   Margaret of Maultasch, in spite of the parties being within the bounds
   of consanguinity forbidden by the Church. His defence is found in
   Goldast, II. 1383-1391. For Ockam's tract, see Riezler, p. 254.

   translation of 1363 is found in a MS. at Florence, Engl. Hist. Rev.,
   1905, p. 302. The work was translated into English under the title The

   omnipotence of the state cut at the root of all individual and Church
   liberty and surpassed in boldness, novelty, and keenness all the
   attacks which the position claimed by the Church in the world had been
   called upon to resist up to that time.

   of the preceding portion of the work. Marsiglius quotes Aristotle and
   other classic writers, Augustine and other Fathers, Hugo of St. Victor
   and other Schoolmen, but he ignores Thomas Aquinas, and never even
   mentions his name.

   depended upon any of his predecessors for his principles of Church
   government, it was upon the keen writer of the fourteenth century."

   [150] Pastor, I. 84, shifts this notoriety from Huss to Marsiglius.
   Riezler, p. 232, and Haller, p. 77, compare Marsiglius' keenness of

   [152] Compared with Wyclif, a pamphleteer as keen as he, Marsiglius did
   not enter into the merits of distinctly theological doctrine nor see
   the deep connection between the dogma of transubstantiation and
   sacramental penance and papal tyranny as the English reformer did. But
   so far as questions of government are concerned, he went as far as
   Wyclif or farther. See the comparison, as elaborated by Poole, p. 275.

   which make the pope out to be the summit of the earth, the wonder of
   the world, the doorkeeper of heaven, a treasury of delights, the only

   § 9. The Financial Policy of the Avignon Popes.

   The most notable feature of the Avignon period of the papacy, next to
   its subserviency to France, was the development of the papal financial
   system and the unscrupulous traffic which it plied in spiritual
   benefits and ecclesiastical offices. The theory was put into practice
   that every spiritual favor has its price in money. It was John XXII.'s
   achievement to reduce the taxation of Christendom to a finely organized
   system.

   The papal court had a proper claim for financial support on all parts
   of the Latin Church, for it ministered to all. This just claim gave way
   to a practice which made it seem as if Christendom existed to sustain
   the papal establishment in a state of luxury and ease. Avignon took on
   the aspect of an exchange whose chief business was getting money, a
   vast bureau where privileges, labelled as of heavenly efficacy, were
   sold for gold. Its machinery for collecting moneys was more extensive
   and intricate than the machinery of any secular court of the age. To
   contemporaries, commercial transactions at the central seat of
   Christendom seemed much more at home than services of religious
   devotion.

   The mind of John XXII. ran naturally to the counting-house and ledger
   system. [165] He came from Cahors, the town noted for its brokers and
   bankers. Under his favor the seeds of commercialism in the dispensation
   of papal appointments sown in preceding centuries grew to ripe
   fruitage. Simony was an old sin. Gregory VII. fought against it. John
   legalized its practice.

   Freewill offerings and Peter's pence had been made to popes from of
   old. States, held as fiefs of the papal chair, had paid fixed tribute.
   For the expenses of the crusades, Innocent III. had inaugurated the
   system of taxing the entire Church. The receipts from this source
   developed the love of money at the papal court and showed its power,
   and, no matter how abstemious a pope might be in his own habits, greed
   grew like a weed in his ecclesiastical household. St. Bernard, d. 1153,
   complained bitterly of the cupidity of the Romans, who made every
   possible monetary gain out of the spiritual favors of which the Vatican
   was the dispenser. By indulgence, this appetite became more and more
   exacting, and under John and his successors the exploitation of
   Christendom was reduced by the curia to a fine art.

   The theory of ecclesiastical appointments, held in the Avignon period,
   was that, by reason of the fulness of power which resides in the
   Apostolic See, the pope may dispense all the dignities and benefices of
   the Christian world. The pope is absolute in his own house, that is,
   the Church.

   This principle had received its full statement from Clement IV., 1265.
   [166] Clement's bull declared that the supreme pontiff is superior to
   any customs which were in vogue of filling Church offices and
   conflicted with his prerogative. In particular he made it a law that
   all offices, dignities, and benefices were subject to papal appointment
   which became vacant apud sedem apostolicam or in curia, that is, while
   the holders were visiting the papal court. This law was modified by
   Gregory X. at the Council of Lyons, 1274, in such a way as to restore
   the right of election, provided the pope failed to make an appointment
   within a month. [167] Boniface VIII., 1295, again extended the
   enactment by putting in the pope's hands all livings whose occupants
   died within two days' journey of the curia, wherever it might at the
   time be. [168] Innocent IV. was the first pope to exercise the right of
   reservation or collation on a large scale. In 1248, out of 20 places in
   the cathedral of Constance, 17 were occupied by papal appointees, and
   there were 14 "expectants" under appointment in advance of the deaths
   of the occupants. In 1255, Alexander IV. limited the number of such
   expectants to 4 for each church. In 1265, Clement IV forbade all
   elections in England in the usual way until his commands were complied
   with, and reserved them to himself. The same pontiff, on the pretext of
   disturbances going on in Sicily, made a general reservation of all
   appointments in the realm, otherwise subject to episcopal or capitular
   choice. Urban IV. withdrew the right of election from the Ghibelline
   cities of Lombardy; Martin IV. and Honorius IV. applied the same rule
   to the cathedral appointments of Sicily and Aragon; Honorius IV.
   monopolized all the appointments of the Latin Church in the East; and
   Boniface VIII., in view of Philip IV.'s resistance, reserved to himself
   the appointments to all "cathedral and regular churches" in France. Of
   16 French sees which became vacant, 1295-1301, only one was filled in
   the usual way by election. [169]

   With the haughty assumption of Clement IV.'s bull and the practice of
   later popes, papal writers fell in. Augustinus Triumphus, writing in
   1324, asserted that the pope is above all canon law and has the right
   to dispose of all ecclesiastical places. [170] The papal system of
   appointments included provisions, expectances, and reservations. [171]

   In setting aside the vested rights of chapters and other electors, the
   pope often joined hands with kings and princes. In the Avignon period a
   regular election by a chapter was the exception. [172] The Chronicles
   of England and France teem with usurped cases of papal appointment. In
   1322 the pope reserved to himself all the appointments in episcopal,
   cathedral, and abbey churches, and of all priors in the sees of
   Aquileja, Ravenna, Milan, Genoa, and Pisa. [173] In 1329 he made such
   reservation for the German dioceses of Metz, Toul, and Verdun, and in
   1339 for Cologne. [174] There was no living in Latin Christendom which
   was safe from the pope's hands. There were not places enough to satisfy
   all the favorites of the papal household and the applicants pressed
   upon the pope's attention by kings and princes. The spiritual and
   administrative qualities of the appointees were not too closely
   scrutinized. Frenchmen were appointed to sees in England, Germany,
   Denmark, and other countries, who were utterly unfamiliar with the
   languages of those countries. Marsiglius complains of these
   "monstrosities "and, among other unfit appointments, mentions the
   French bishops of Winchester and Lund, neither of whom knew English or
   Danish. The archbishop of Lund, after plundering his diocese, returned
   to Southern France.

   To the supreme right of appointment was added the supreme right to tax
   the clergy and all ecclesiastical property. The supreme right to
   exercise authority over kings, the supreme right to set aside canonical
   rules, the supreme right to make appointments in the Church, the
   supreme right to tax Church property, these were, in their order, the
   rights asserted by the popes of the Middle Ages. The scandal growing
   out of this unlimited right of taxation called forth the most vigorous
   complaints from clergy and laity, and was in large part the cause which
   led to the summoning of the three great Reformatory councils of the
   fifteenth century. [175]

   Popes had acted upon this theory of jurisdiction over the property of
   the Church long before John XXII. They levied taxes for crusades in the
   Orient, or to free Italy from rebels for the papal state. They gave
   their sanction to princes and kings to levy taxes upon the Church for
   secular purposes, especially for wars. [176] In the bull Clericis
   laicos, Boniface did not mean to call in question the propriety of the
   Church's contributing to the necessities of the state. What he demanded
   was that he himself should be recognized as arbiter in such matters,
   and it was this demand which gave offence to the French king and to
   France itself. The question was much discussed whether the pope may
   commit simony. Thomas Aquinas gave an affirmative answer. Alvarus
   Pelagius [177] thought differently, and declared that the pope is
   exempt from the laws and canons which treat of simony. Augustinus
   Triumphus took the same ground. [178] The pope is not bound by laws. He
   is above laws. Simony is not possible to him.

   In estimating the necessities of the papal court, which justified the
   imposition of customs, the Avignon popes were no longer their own
   masters. They were the creatures of the camera and the hungry horde of
   officials and sycophants whose clamor filled the papal offices day and
   night. These retainers were not satisfied with bread. Every superior
   office in Christendom had its value in terms of gold and silver. When
   it was filled by papal appointment, a befitting fee was the proper
   recognition. If a favor was granted to a prince in the appointment of a
   favorite, the papal court was pretty sure to seize some new privilege
   as a compensation for itself. Precedent was easily made a permanent
   rule. Where the pope once invaded the rights of a chapter, he did not
   relinquish his hold, and an admission fee once fixed was not renounced.
   We may not be surprised at the rapacity which was developed at the
   papal court. That was to be expected. It grew out of the false papal
   theory and the abiding qualities of human nature. [179]

   The details governing the administration of the papal finances John set
   forth in two bulls of 1316 and 1331. His scheme fixed the financial
   policy of the papacy and sacred college. [180] The sources from which
   the papacy drew its revenues in the fourteenth century were: (1)
   freewill offerings, so called, given for ecclesiastical appointments
   and other papal favors, called visitations, annates, servitia; and (2)
   tributes from feudal states such as Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, and
   England, and the revenues from the papal state in Italy. [181] The
   moneys so received were apportioned between four parties, the pope, the
   college of cardinals, and their two households. Under John XXlI. the
   freewill offerings, so called, came to be regarded as obligatory fees.
   Every papal gift had its compensation. There was a list of prices, and
   it remained in force till changed on the basis of new estimates of the
   incomes of benefices. To answer objections, John XXII., in his bull of
   1331, insisted that the prices set upon such favors were not a charge
   for the grace imparted, but a charge for the labor required for writing
   the pertinent documents. [182] But the declaration did not remove the
   ill odor of the practice. The taxes levied were out of all proportion
   to the actual cost of the written documents, and the privileges were
   not to be had without money.

   These payments were regularly recorded in registers or ledgers kept by
   the papal secretaries of the camera. The details of the papal
   exchequer, extant in the Archives of the Vatican, have only recently
   been subjected to careful investigation through the liberal policy of
   Leo XIII., and have made possible a new chapter in works setting forth
   the history of the Church in this fourteenth century. [183]

   These studies confirm the impression left by the chroniclers and
   tract-writers of the fourteenth century. The money dealings of the
   papal court were on a vast scale, and the transactions were according
   to strict rules of merchandise. [184] Avignon was a great money centre.
   Spiritual privileges were vouched for by carefully worded and signed
   contracts and receipts. The papal commercial agents went to all parts
   of Europe.

   Archbishop, bishop, and abbot paid for the letters confirming their
   titles to their dignities. The appointees to lower clerical offices did
   the same. There were fees for all sorts of concessions, dispensations
   and indulgences, granted to layman and to priest. The priest born out
   of wedlock, the priest seeking to be absent from his living, the priest
   about to be ordained before the canonical age, all had to have a
   dispensation, and these cost money. [185] The larger revenues went
   directly into the papal treasury and the treasury of the camera. The
   smaller fees went to notaries, doorkeepers, to individual cardinals,
   and other officials. These intermediaries stood in a long line with
   palms upturned. To use a modern term, it was an intricate system of
   graft. The beneficiaries were almost endless. The large body of lower
   officials are usually designated in the ledgers by the general term
   "familiars" of the pope or camera. [186] The notaries, or copyists,
   received stipulated sums for every document they transcribed and
   service they performed. However exorbitant the demands might seem, the
   petitioners were harried by delays and other petty annoyances till in
   sheer weariness they yielded.

   The taxes levied upon the higher clergy were usually paid at Avignon by
   the parties in person. For the collection of the annates from the lower
   clergy and of tithes and other general taxes, collectors and
   subcollectors were appointed. We find these officials in different
   parts of Europe. They had their fixed salaries, and sent periodical
   reckonings to the central bureau at Avignon. [187] The transmission of
   the moneys they collected was often a dangerous business. Not
   infrequently the carriers were robbed on their way, and the system came
   into vogue of employing merchant and banking houses to do this
   business, especially Italian firms, which had representatives in
   Northern and Central Europe. The ledgers show a great diversity in the
   names and value of the coins. And it was a nice process to estimate the
   values of these moneys in the terms of the more generally accepted
   standards. [188]

   The offerings made by prelates at their visits to the papal see, called
   visitationes, [189] were divided equally between the papal treasury and
   the cardinals. From the lists, it appears that the archbishops of York
   paid every three years "300 marks sterling, or 1200 gold florins."
   Every two years the archbishops of Canterbury paid "300 marks sterling,
   or 1500 gold florins;" the archbishop of Tours paid 400 pounds
   Tournois; of Rheims, 500 pounds, Tournois; of Rouen, 1000 pounds
   Tournois. [190] The archbishop of Armagh, at his visitation in 1301,
   paid 60 silver marks, or 250 gold florins. In 1350 the camera claimed
   from Armagh back payments for fifty years. [191] Presumably no bishop
   of that Irish diocese had made a visit in that interval. Whether the
   claim was honored or not, is not known.

   The servitia communia, or payments made by archbishops, bishops, and
   abbots on their confirmation to office, were also listed, according to
   a fixed scale. The voluntary idea had completely disappeared before a
   fixed assessment. [192] Such a dignitary was called an electus until he
   had paid off the tax. [193] In certain cases the tax was remitted on
   account of the poverty of the ecclesiastic, and in the ledgers the
   entry was made, "not taxed on account of poverty," non taxata propter
   paupertatem. The amount of this tax seems to have varied, and was
   sometimes one-third of the income and sometimes a larger portion. [194]
   In the fourteenth century the following sees paid servitia as follows:
   Mainz, 5,000 gold florins; Treves, 7, 000; Cologne, 10,000; Narbonne,
   10,000. On the basis of a new valuation, Martin V. in 1420 raised the
   taxation of the sees of Mainz and Treves to 10,000 florins each, or
   $25,000 of our money, so that they corresponded to the assessment made
   from of old upon Cologne. [195] When an incumbent died without having
   met the full tax, his successor made up the deficit in addition to
   paying the assessment for his own confirmation. [196]

   The following cases will give some idea of the annoyances to which
   bishops and abbots were put who travelled to Avignon to secure letters
   of papal confirmation to their offices. In 1334, the abbot-elect of St.
   Augustine, Canterbury, had to wait in Avignon from April 22 to Aug. 9
   to get his confirmation, and it cost him 148 pounds sterling. John IV.,
   abbot-elect of St. Albans, in 1302 went for consecration to Rome,
   accompanied by four monks. He arrived May 6, presented his case to
   Boniface VIII. in person at Anagni, May 9, and did not get back to
   London till Aug. 1, being all the while engaged in the process of
   getting his papers properly prepared and certified to. [197] The
   expense of getting his case through was 2,585 marks, or 10,340 gold
   florins; or $25,000 of our money. The ways in which this large sum was
   distributed are not a matter of conjecture. The exact itemized
   statement is extant: 2,258 marks, or 9,032 florins, went to "the Lord
   pope and the cardinals." Of this sum 5,000 florins, or 1,250 marks, are
   entered as a payment for the visitatio, and the remainder in payment of
   the servitium to the cardinals. The remaining 327 marks, or 1,308
   florins, were consumed in registration and notarial fees and gifts to
   cardinals. To Cardinal Francis of St. Maria in Cosmedin, a nephew of
   Boniface, a gift was made costing more than 10 marks, or 40 florins.

   Another abbot-elect of St. Albans, Richard II., went to Avignon in 1326
   accompanied by six monks, and was well satisfied to get away with the
   payment of 3,600 gold florins. He was surprised that the tax was so
   reasonable. Abbot William of the diocese of Autun, Oct. 22, 1316,
   obligated himself to pay John XXII., as confirmation tax, 1,500 gold
   florins, and to John's officials 170 more. [198]

   The fees paid to the lower officials, called servitia minuta, were
   classified under five heads, four of them going to the officials,
   familiares of the pontiff, and one to the officials of the cardinals.
   [199] The exact amounts received on account of servitia or confirmation
   fees by the pope and the college of cardinals, probably will never be
   known. From the lists that have been examined, the cardinals between
   1316-1323 received from this source 234,047 gold florins, or about
   39,000 florins a year. As the yield from this tax was usually, though
   not always, divided in equal shares between the pope and the cardinals,
   the full sum realized from this source was double this amount. [200]

   The annates, so far as they were the tax levied by the pope upon
   appointments made by himself to lower clerical offices and livings,
   went entirely into the papal treasury, and seem to have been uniformly
   one-half of the first year's income. [201] They were designated as
   livings "becoming vacant in curia," which was another way of saying,
   places which had been reserved by the pope. The popes from time to time
   extended this tax through the use of the right of reservation to all
   livings becoming vacant in a given district during a certain period. In
   addition to the annate tax, the papal treasury also drew an income
   during the period of their vacancy from the livings reserved for papal
   appointment and during the period when an incumbent held the living
   without canonical right. These were called the "intermediate
   fruits"--medii fructus. [202]

   Special indulgences were an uncertain but no less important source of
   revenue. The prices were graded according to the ability of the parties
   to pay and the supposed inherent value of the papal concession. Queen
   Johanna of Sicily paid 500 grossi Tournois, or about $150, for the
   privilege of taking the oath to the archbishop of Naples, who acted as
   the pope's representative. The bull readmitting to the sacraments of
   the Church Margaret of Maultasch and her husband, Lewis of Brandenburg,
   the son of Lewis the Bavarian, cost the princess 2000 grossi Tournois.
   The king of Cyprus was poor, and secured for his subjects indulgence to
   trade with the Egyptians for the modest sum of 100 pounds Tournois, but
   had to pay 50 pounds additional for a ship sent with cargo to Egypt.
   [203] There was a graduated scale for papal letters giving persons
   liberty to choose their confessor without regard to the parish priests.

   To these sources of income were added the taxes for the relief of the
   Holy Land--pro subsidio terrae sanctae. The Council of Vienne ordered a
   tenth for six years for this purpose. John XXII., 1333, repeated the
   substance of Clement's bull. The expense of clearing Italy of hostile
   elements and reclaiming papal territory as a preliminary to the pope's
   return to Rome was also made the pretext for levying special taxes. For
   this object Innocent VI. levied a three-years' tax of a tenth upon the
   Church in Germany, and in 1366 Urban V. levied another tenth upon all
   the churches of Christendom. [204]

   It would be a mistake to suppose that the Church always responded to
   these appeals, or that the collectors had easy work in making
   collections. The complaints, which we found so numerous in England in
   the thirteenth century, we meet with everywhere during the fourteenth
   century. The resistance was determined, and the taxes were often left
   unpaid for years or not paid at all.

   The revenues derived from feudal states and princes, called census,
   were divided equally between the cardinals and the pope's private
   treasury. Gregory X., in 1272, was the first to make such a division of
   the tribute from Sicily, which amounted to 8000 ounces of gold, or
   about $90,000. [205] In the pontificate of John XXII. there is frequent
   mention of the amounts contributed by Sicily and their equal partition.
   The sums varied from year to year, and in 1304 it was 3000 ounces of
   gold. The tribute of Sardinia and Corsica was fixed in 1297 at the
   annual sum of 2000 marks, and was divided between the two treasuries.
   [206] The papal state and Ferrara yielded uncertain sums, and the
   tribute of 1000 marks, pledged by John of England, was paid
   irregularly, and finally abrogated altogether. Peter's pence, which
   belongs in this category, was an irregular source of papal income.
   [207]

   The yearly income of the papal treasury under Clement V. and John XXII.
   has been estimated at from 200,000 to 250,000 gold florins. [208] In
   1353 it is known to have been at least 260,000 florins, or more than
   $600,000 of our money

   These sources of income were not always sufficient for the expenses of
   the papal household, and in cases had to be anticipated by loans. The
   popes borrowed from cardinals, from princes, and from bankers. Urban V.
   got a loan from his cardinals of 30, 000 gold florins. Gregory XI. got
   loans of 30,000 florins from the king of Navarre, and 60, 000 from the
   duke of Anjou. The duke seems to have been a ready lender, and on
   another occasion loaned Gregory 40,000 florins. [209] It was a common
   thing for bishops and abbots to make loans to enable them to pay the
   expense of their confirmation. The abbot of St. Albans, in 1290, was
   assessed 1300 pounds for his servitium, and borrowed 500 of it. [210]
   The habit grew until the time of the Reformation, when the sums
   borrowed, as in the case of Albrecht, archbishop of Mainz, were
   enormous.

   The transactions of the Avignon chancellory called forth loud
   complaints, even from contemporary apologists for the papacy. Alvarus
   Pelagius, in his Lament over the Church, wrote: "No poor man can
   approach the pope. He will call and no one will answer, because he has
   no money in his purse to pay. Scarcely is a single petition heeded by
   the pope until it has passed through the hands of middlemen, a corrupt
   set, bought with bribes, and the officials conspire together to extort
   more than the rule calls for." In another place he said that whenever
   he entered into the papal chambers he always found the tables full of
   gold, and clerics counting and weighing florins. [211] Of the Spanish
   bishops he said that there was scarcely one in a hundred who did not
   receive money for ordinations and the gift of benefices. Matters grew
   no better, but rather worse as the fourteenth century advanced.
   Dietrich of Nieheim, speaking of Boniface IX., said that "the pope was
   an insatiable gulf, and that as for avarice there was no one to compare
   with him." [212] To effect a cure of the disease, which was a scandal
   to Christendom, the popes would have been obliged to cut off the great
   army of officials who surrounded them. But this vast organized body was
   stronger than the Roman pontiff. The fundamental theory of the rights
   of the papal office was at fault. The councils made attempts to
   introduce reforms, but in vain. Help came at last and from an
   unexpected quarter, when Luther and the other leaders openly revolted
   against the mediaeval theory of the papacy and of the Church.

   [171] A provision that is providere ecclesiae de episcopo signified in

   Liber sextus, I. 16, 18; Friedberg's ed., II. 969. See Stubbs, Const.
   Hist., III. 320. "Collations" was also used as a general term to cover

   [176] The course of Clement V., in allowing grants to Philip the Fair,
   Charles of Valois, and other princes, was followed by John. In 1316 he
   granted to the king of France a tenth and annates for four years, in
   1326 a tenth for two years, and in 1333 a tenth for six years. The
   English king, in 1317, was given a share of the tenth appointed by the
   Council of Vienne for a crusade and at the same time one-half of the
   annates. Again, in the years 1319, 1322, 1330, a tenth was accorded to
   the same sovereign. See Haller, p. 116 sq.

   [179] Kirsch: Kollektorien, p. xii sq. and other Catholic writers make
   some defence of John's financial measures on the ground that the
   sources of income from the State of the Church dried up when the papacy
   was transferred to Avignon.

   [183] Woker took up the study in 1878, and has been followed by a
   number of scholars such as Tangl, Gottlob, Goeller, Haller, Baumgarten,
   Schulte, and especially Dr. Kirsch, professor of church history in the
   Catholic University of Freiburg, Switzerland. See, for a full
   description, Baumgarten, pp. v-xiii. The subject involves a vast array
   of figures and commercial briefs of all kinds, and includes the
   organization of the camera, the system of collection, the graduated
   scales of prices, the transmission of moneys to Avignon, the division
   of the receipts between the pope and the cardinals, the values of the
   numerous coins, etc. Garampi, a keeper of the Vatican Archives, in the
   eighteenth century arranged these registers according to countries. See
   Kirsch, Kollektorien, p. vii, and Rückkehr, p. xli-l; Tangl, vi sqq.;
   Baumgarten, viii, x sqq.

   [184] Kirsch: Kollektorien, p. vii, note, gives four different headings
   under which the moneys were recorded, namely: (1) census and
   visitations; (2) bulls; (3) servitia communia; (4) sundry sources. He
   also gives the entries under which disbursements were entered, such as
   the kitchen, books and parchments, palfreys, journeys, wars, etc.

   [186] As an example of the host of these officials who had to be fed,
   see Tangl, pp. 64-67. He gives a list of the fees paid by agents of the
   city of Cologne, which was seeking certain bulls in 1393. The title
   "secretary" does not occur till the reign of Benedict XII., 1338.
   Goeller, p. 46.

   [187] One of the allowances made by John XXII. for collectors was 5
   gold florins a day. Kirsch: Kollektorien, VII. sqq., XLIX. sqq. Kirsch
   gives the official ledgers of papal collectors in Basel, pp. 4-32, and
   other sees of Germany. Sometimes the bishop acted as collector in his
   diocese, Goeller, p. 71.

   [188] For elaborate comparisons of the value of the different coins of
   the fourteenth century, see Kirsch, Kollektorien, LXXVIII. and
   Rückkehr, p. xli sqq. Gottlob, pp. 133, 174 sq., etc. Baumgarten, CCXI
   sqq. The silver mark, the gold florin and the pound Tournois were among
   the larger coins most current. One mark was worth 4 or 6 gold florins,
   or 8 pounds Tournois. The grossus Turonensis was equal to about 26
   cents of our value. See Tangl, 14. For the different estimates of marks
   in florins, see Baumgarten, CXXI. The gold florin had the face value of
   $2.50 of our money, or nearly 10 marks German coinage. See Kirsch,
   Kollektorien, p. Ixx; Rückkehr, p. xlv; Gottlob, Servitientaxe, p. 176;
   Baumgarten, p. ccxiii; Tangl, 14, etc. Kirsch gives the purchasing
   price of money in the fourteenth century as four times what it now is,
   Finanzerverwaltung p. 56. The gold mark in 1370 was worth 62 gold
   florins the silver mark 5 florins, Kirsch: Rückkehr, p. xlv. Kirsch:
   Rückkehr, pp. l-lxi, gives a very elaborate and valuable list of the
   prices of commodities and wages in 1370 from the Vatican ledger
   accounts. Urban V.'s agents bought two horses for 117 florins gold and
   two mules for 90 florins. They paid 1 gold florin for 12 pairs of shoes
   and 1 pair of boots. A salma of wheat--equal to 733 loaves of
   bread--cost 4 florins, or $10 in our money. The keeper of the papal
   stables received 120 gold florins a year. The senator of Rome received
   from Gregory XI. 600 gold florins a month. A watchman of the papal
   palace, 7 gold florins a month. Carpenters received from 12-18
   shillings Provis, or 60-80 cents, 47 of these coins being equal to 1
   gold florin.

   1326 the assessment of the see of Breslau was reduced from 4, 000 to 1,
   786 gold florins. Kirsch: Finanzverwaltung, p. 8.

   [196] For cases, see Baumgarten, p. cviii. Attempts to get rid of this
   assessment were unavailing. The bishop of Bamberg, in 1335, left
   Avignon without a bull of confirmation because he had not made the
   prescribed payment. The reason is not recorded, but the statement is
   spread on the ledger entry that episcopal confirmation should not be
   granted to him till the Apostolic letters pertaining to it were
   properly registered and delivered by the Apostolic camera. Goeller, p.
   69.

   subject, Kirsch, Kollektorien, p. xxv sqq. He mentions the papal
   collector, Gerardus, who gives a continuous list for the years
   1343-1360, of such payments of annates, fructus beneficiorum vacantium
   ad Cameram Apostolicam pertinentes. The annates, or annalia, were
   originally given to the bishops when livings became vacant, but were
   gradually reserved for the papal treasury. See Friedberg, Kirchliche
   Abgaben, in Herzog, I. 95.

   ounce of gold was estimated at 5 florins, a pound of gold at 96
   florins. See Kirsch, Finanzverwaltung, p. 71; Baumgarten, p. ccxi.

   § 10. The Later Avignon Popes.

   The bustling and scholastic John XXII. was followed by the scholarly
   and upright Benedict XII., 1334-1342. Born in the diocese of Toulouse,
   Benedict studied in Paris, and arose to the dignity of bishop and
   cardinal before his elevation to the papal throne. If Villani is to be
   trusted, his election was an accident. One cardinal after another who
   voted for him did so, not dreaming he would be elected. The choice
   proved to be an excellent one. The new pontiff at once showed interest
   in reform. The prelates who had no distinct duties at Avignon he sent
   home, and to his credit it was recorded that, when urged to enrich his
   relatives, he replied that the vicar of Christ, like Melchizedek, must
   be without father or mother or genealogy. To him belongs the honor of
   having begun the erection of the permanent papal palace at Avignon, a
   massive and grim structure, having the features of a fortress rather
   than a residence. Its walls and towers were built of colossal thickness
   and strength to resist attack. Its now desolated spaces are a
   speechless witness to perhaps the most singular of the episodes of
   papal history. The cardinals followed Benedict's example and built
   palaces in Avignon and its vicinity.

   Clement VI., 1342-1352, who had been archbishop of Rouen, squandered
   the fortune amassed by John XXII. and prudently administered by
   Benedict. He forgot his Benedictine training and vows and was a fast
   liver, carrying into the papal office the tastes of the French nobility
   from which he sprang. Horses, a sumptuous table, and the company of
   women made the papal palace as gay as a royal court. [213] Nor were his
   relatives allowed to go uncared for. Of the twenty-five cardinals' hats
   which he distributed, twelve went to them, one a brother and one a
   nephew. Clement enjoyed a reputation for eloquence and, like John
   XXII., preached after he became pope. Early in his pontificate the
   Romans sent a delegation, which included Petrarch, begging him to
   return to Rome. But Clement, a Frenchman to the core, preferred the
   atmosphere of France. Though he did not go to Rome, he was gracious
   enough to comply with the delegation's request and appoint a Jubilee
   for the deserted and impoverished city.

   During Clement's rule, Rome lived out one of the picturesque episodes
   of its mediaeval history, the meteoric career of the tribune Cola
   (Nicolas) di Rienzo. Of plebeian birth, this visionary man was stirred
   with the ideals of Roman independence and glory by reading the ancient
   classics. His oratory flattered and moved the people, whose cause he
   espoused against the aristocratic families of the city. Sent to Avignon
   at the head of a commission, 1343, to confer the highest municipal
   authority upon the pope, he won Clement's attention by his frank manner
   and eloquent speech. Returning to Rome, he fascinated the people with
   visions of freedom and dominion. They invested him on the Capitol with
   the signiory of the city, 1347. Cola assumed the democratic title of
   tribune. Writing from Avignon, Petrarch greeted him as the man whom he
   had been looking for, and dedicated to him one of his finest odes. The
   tribune sought to extend his influence by enkindling the flame of
   patriotism throughout all Italy and to induce its cities to throw off
   the yoke of their tyrants. Success and glory turned his head.
   Intoxicated with applause, he had the audacity to cite Lewis the
   Bavarian and Charles IV. before his tribunal, and headed his
   communications with the magnificent superscription, "In the first year
   of the Republic's freedom." His success lasted but seven months. The
   people had grown weary of their idol. He was laid by Clement under the
   ban and fled, to appear again for a brief season under Innocent V.

   Avignon was made papal property by Clement, who paid Joanna of Naples
   80, 000 florins for it. The low price may have been in consideration of
   the pope's services in pronouncing the princess guiltless of the murder
   of her cousin and first husband, Andreas, a royal Hungarian prince, and
   sanctioning her second marriage with another cousin, the prince of
   Tarentum.

   This pontiff witnessed the conclusion of the disturbed career of Lewis
   the Bavarian, in 1347. The emperor had sunk to the depths of
   self-abasement when he swore to the 28 articles Clement laid before
   him, Sept. 18, 1343, and wrote to the pope that, as a babe longs for
   its mother's breast, so his soul cried out for the grace of the pope
   and the Church. But, if possible, Clement intensified the curses placed
   upon him by his two predecessors. The bull, which he announced with his
   own lips, April 13, 1346, teems with rabid execrations. It called upon
   God to strike Lewis with insanity, blindness, and madness. It invoked
   the thunderbolts of heaven and the flaming wrath of God and the
   Apostles Peter and Paul both in this world and the next. It called all
   the elements to rise in hostility against him; upon the universe to
   fight against him, and the earth to open and swallow him up alive. It
   blasphemously damned his house to desolation and his children to
   exclusion from their abode. It invoked upon him the curse of beholding
   with his own eyes the destruction of his children by their enemies.
   [214]

   During Clement's pontificate, 1348-1349, the Black Death swept over
   Europe from Hungary to Scotland and from Spain to Sweden, one of the
   most awful and mysterious scourges that has ever visited mankind. It
   was reported by all the chroniclers of the time, and described by
   Boccaccio in the introduction to his novels. According to Villani, the
   disease appeared as carbuncles under the armpits or in the groin,
   sometimes as big as an egg, and was accompanied with devouring fever
   and vomiting of blood. It also involved a gangrenous inflammation of
   the lungs and throat and a fetid odor of the breath. In describing the
   virulence of the infection, a contemporary said that one sick person
   was sufficient to infect the whole world. [215] The patients lingered
   at most a day or two. Boccaccio witnessed the progress of the plague as
   it spread its ravages in Florence. [216] Such measures of sanitation as
   were then known were resorted to, such as keeping the streets of the
   city clean and posting up elaborate rules of health. Public religious
   services and processions were appointed to stay death's progress.
   Boccaccio tells how he saw the hogs dying from the deadly contagion
   which they caught in rooting amongst cast-off clothing. In England all
   sorts of cattle were affected, and Knighton speaks of 5000 sheep dying
   in a single district. [217] The mortality was appalling. The figures,
   though they differ in different accounts, show a vast loss of life.

   A large per cent of the population of Western Europe fell before the
   pestilence. In Siena, 80,000 were carried off; in Venice, 100,000; in
   Bologna, two-thirds of the population; and in Florence, three-fifths.
   In Marseilles the number who died in a single month is reported as
   57,000. Nor was the papal city on the Rhone exempt. Nine cardinals, 70
   prelates, and 17,000 males succumbed. Another writer, a canon writing
   from the city to a friend in Flanders, reports that up to the date of
   his writing one-half of the population had died. The very cats, dogs,
   and chickens took the disease. [218] At the prescription of his
   physician, Guy of Chauliac, Clement VI. stayed within doors and kept
   large fires lighted, as Nicolas IV. before him had done in time of
   plague.

   No class was immune except in England, where the higher classes seem to
   have been exempt. The clergy yielded in great numbers, bishops,
   priests, and monks. At least one archbishop of Canterbury, Bradwardine,
   was carried away by it. The brothers of the king of Sweden, Hacon and
   Knut, were among the victims. The unburied dead strewed the streets of
   Stockholm. Vessels freighted with cargoes were reported floating on the
   high seas with the last sailor dead. [219] Convents were swept clear of
   all their inmates. The cemeteries were not large enough to hold the
   bodies, which were thrown into hastily dug pits. [220] The danger of
   infection and the odors emitted by the corpses were so great that often
   there was no one to give sepulture to the dead. Bishops found cause in
   this neglect to enjoin their priests to preach on the resurrection of
   the body as one of the tenets of the Catholic Church, as did the bishop
   of Winchester. [221] In spite of the vast mortality, many of the people
   gave themselves up without restraint to revelling and drinking from
   tavern to tavern and to other excesses, as Boccaccio reports of
   Florence.

   In England, it is estimated that one-half of the population, or
   2,500,000 people, fell victims to the dread disease. [222] According to
   Knighton, it was introduced into the land through Southampton. As for
   Scotland, this chronicler tells the grewsome story that some of the
   Scotch, on hearing of the weakness of the English in consequence of the
   malady, met in the forest of Selfchyrche--Selkirk--and decided to fall
   upon their unfortunate neighbors, but were suddenly themselves attacked
   by the disease, nearly 5000 dying. The English king prorogued
   parliament. The disaster that came to the industries of the country is
   dwelt upon at length by the English chroniclers. The soil became
   "dead," for there were no laborers left to till it. The price per acre
   was reduced one-half, or even much more. The cattle wandered through
   the meadows and fields of grain, with no one to drive them in. "The
   dread fear of death made the prices of live stock cheap." Horses were
   sold for one-half their usual price, 40 solidi, and a fat steer for 4
   solidi. The price of labor went up, and the cost of the necessaries of
   life became "very high." [223] The effect upon the Church was such as
   to interrupt its ministries and perhaps check its growth. The English
   bishops provided for the exigencies of the moment by issuing letters
   giving to all clerics the right of absolution. The priest could now
   make his price, and instead of 4 or 5 marks, as Knighton reports, he
   could get 10 or 20 after the pestilence had spent its course. To make
   up for the scarcity of ministers, ordination was granted before the
   canonical age, as when Bateman, bishop of Norwich, set apart by the
   sacred rite 60 clerks, "though only shavelings" under 21. In another
   direction the evil effects of the plague were seen. Work was stopped on
   the Cathedral of Siena, which was laid out on a scale of almost
   unsurpassed size, and has not been resumed to this day. [224]

   The Black Death was said to have invaded Europe from the East, and to
   have been carried first by Genoese vessels. [225] Its victims were far
   in excess of the loss of life by any battles or earthquakes known to
   European history, not excepting the Sicilian earthquake of 1908.

   In spite of the plague, and perhaps in gratitude for its cessation, the
   Jubilee Year of 1350, like the Jubilee under Boniface at the opening of
   the century, brought thousands of pilgrims to Rome. If they left scenes
   of desolation in the cities and villages from which they came, they
   found a spectacle of desolation and ruin in the Eternal City which
   Petrarch, visiting the same year, said was enough to move a heart of
   stone. Matthew Villani [226] cannot say too much in praise of the
   devotion of the visiting throngs. Clement's bull extended the benefits
   of his promised indulgence to those who started on a pilgrimage without
   the permission of their superiors, the cleric without the permission of
   his bishop, the monk without the permission of his abbot, and the wife
   without the permission of her husband.

   Of the three popes who followed Clement, only good can be said.
   Innocent VI., 1352-1362, a native of the see of Limoges, had been
   appointed cardinal by Clement VI. Following in the footsteps of
   Benedict XII., he reduced the ostentation of the Avignon court,
   dismissed idle bishops to their sees, and instituted the tribunal of
   the rota, with 21 salaried auditors for the orderly adjudication of
   disputed cases coming before the papal tribunal. Before Innocent's
   election, the cardinals adopted a set of rules limiting the college to
   20 members, and stipulating that no new members should be appointed,
   suspended, deposed, or excommunicated without the consent of two-thirds
   of their number, and that no papal relative should be assigned to a
   high place. Innocent no sooner became pontiff than he set it aside as
   not binding.

   Soon after the beginning of his reign, Innocent released Cola di Rienzo
   from confinement [227] and sent him and Cardinal Aegidius Alvarez of
   Albernoz to Rome in the hope of establishing order. Cola was appointed
   senator, but only a few months afterwards was put to death in a popular
   uprising, Oct. 8, 1354. He dreamed of a united Italy, 500 years before
   the union of its divided states was consummated, but his name remains a
   powerful impulse to popular freedom and national unity in the
   peninsula.

   Tyrants and demagogues infested Italian municipalities and were sucking
   their life-blood. The State of the Church had been parcelled up into
   petty principalities ruled by rude nobles, such as the Polentas in
   Ravenna, the Malatestas in Rimini, the Montefeltros in Urbino. The pope
   was in danger of losing his territory in the peninsula altogether.
   Soldiers of fortune from different nations had settled upon it and
   spread terror as leaders of predatory bands. In no part was anarchy
   more wild than in Rome itself, and in the Campagna. Albernoz had fought
   in the wars against the Moors, and had administered the see of Toledo.
   He was a statesman as well as a soldier. He was fully equal to his
   difficult task and restored the papal government. [228]

   In 1355, Albernoz, as administrator of Rome, placed the crown of the
   empire on the head of Charles IV. To such a degree had the imperial
   dignity been brought that Charles was denied permission by the pope to
   enter the city till the day appointed for his coronation. His arrival
   in Italy was welcomed by Petrarch as Henry VII.'s arrival had been
   welcomed by Dante. But the emperor disappointed every expectation, and
   his return from Italy was an inglorious retreat. He placed his own
   dominion of Bohemia in his debt by becoming the founder of the
   University of Prag. [229] It was he also who, in 1356, issued the
   celebrated Golden Bull, which laid down the rules for the election of
   the emperor. They placed this transaction wholly in the hands of the
   electors, a majority of whom was sufficient for a choice. The pope is
   not mentioned in the document. Frankfurt was made the place of meeting.
   The electors designated were the archbishops of Mainz, Treves, and
   Cologne, the Count Palatine, the king of Bohemia, the Margrave of
   Brandenburg, and the duke of Saxony. [230]

   Urban V., 1362-1370, at the time of his election abbot of the
   Benedictine convent of St. Victor in Marseilles, developed merits which
   secured for him canonization by Pius IX., 1870. He was the first of the
   Avignon popes to visit Rome. Petrarch, as he had written before to
   Benedict XII. and Clement VI., now, in his old age, wrote to the new
   pontiff rebuking the curia for its vices and calling upon him to be
   faithful to his part as Roman bishop. Why should Urban hide himself
   away in a corner of the earth? Italy was fair, and Rome, hallowed by
   history and legend of empire and Church, was the theocratic capital of
   the world. Charles IV. visited Avignon and offered to escort the
   pontiff. But the French king opposed the plan and was supported by the
   cardinals in a body. Only three Italians were left in it. Urban started
   for the home of his spiritual ancestors in April, 1367. A fleet of
   sixty vessels furnished by Naples, Genoa, Venice, and Pisa conducted
   the distinguished traveller from Marseilles to Genoa and Corneto, where
   he was met by envoys from Rome, who put into his hands the keys of the
   castle of St. Angelo, the symbol of full municipal power. All along the
   way transports of wine, fish, cheese, and other provisions, sent on
   from Avignon, met the papal party, and horses from the papal stables on
   the Rhone were in waiting for the pope at every stage of the journey.
   [231]

   At Viterbo, a riot was called forth by the insolent manners of the
   French, and the pope launched the interdict against the city. The papal
   ledgers contain the outlay by the apothecary for medicines for the
   papal servants who were wounded in the melee. Here Albernoz died, to
   whom the papacy owed a large debt for his services in restoring order
   to Rome. The legend runs that, when he was asked by the pope for an
   account of his administration, he loaded a car with the keys of the
   cities he had recovered to the papal authority, and sent them to him.

   Urban chose as his residence the Vatican in preference to the Lateran.
   The preparations for his advent included the restoration of the palace
   and its gardens. A part of the garden was used as a field, and the rest
   was overgrown with thorns. Urban ordered it replanted with grape-vines
   and fruit trees. The papal ledger gives the cost of these improvements
   as 6,621 gold florins, or about $15,000. Roofs, floors, doors, walls,
   and other parts of the palace had to be renewed. The expenses from
   April 27, 1367, to November, 1368, as shown in the report of the papal
   treasurer, Gaucelin de Pradello, were 15,559 florins, or $39,000. [232]

   During the sixty years that had elapsed since Clement V. fixed the
   papal residence in France, Rome had been reduced almost to a museum of
   Christian monuments, as it had before been a museum of pagan ruins. The
   aristocratic families had forsaken the city. The Lateran had again
   fallen a prey to the flames in 1360. St. Paul's was desolate. Rubbish
   or stagnant pools filled the streets. The population was reduced to
   20,000 or perhaps 17,000. [233] The return of the papacy was compared
   by Petrarch to Israel returning out of Egypt.

   Urban set about the restoration of churches. He gave 1000 florins to
   the Lateran and spent 5000 on St. Paul's. Rome showed signs of again
   becoming the centre of European society and politics. Joanna, queen of
   Naples, visited the city, and so did the king of Cyprus and the
   emperor, Charles IV. In 1369 John V. Palaeologus, the Byzantine
   emperor, arrived, a suppliant for aid against the Turks, and publicly
   made solemn abjuration of his schismatic tenets.

   The old days seemed to have returned, but Urban was not satisfied. He
   had not the courage nor the wide vision to sacrifice his own pleasure
   for the good of his office. Had he so done, the disastrous schism might
   have been averted. He turned his face back towards Avignon, where he
   arrived "at the hour of vespers," Sept. 27, 1370. He survived his
   return scarcely two months, and died Dec. 19, 1370, universally beloved
   and already honored as a saint.

   once full of men became destitute of inhabitants, and so violently did
   the pestilence increase that the living were scarcely able to bury the
   dead. In certain houses of men of religion, scarcely two out of twenty
   men survived. It was estimated by many that scarcely one-tenth of

   § 11. The Re-establishment of the Papacy in Rome. 1377.

   Of the nineteen cardinals who entered the conclave at the death of
   Urban V., all but four were Frenchmen. The choice immediately fell on
   Gregory XI., the son of a French count. At 17 he had been made cardinal
   by his uncle, Clement VI. His contemporaries praised him for his moral
   purity, affability, and piety. He showed his national sympathies by
   appointing 18 Frenchmen cardinals and filling papal appointments in
   Italy with French officials. In English history he is known for his
   condemnation of Wyclif. His pontificate extended from 1370-1378.

   With Gregory's name is associated the re-establishment of the papacy in
   its proper home on the Tiber. For this change the pope deserves no
   credit. It was consummated against his will. He went to Rome, but was
   engaged in preparations to return to Avignon, when death suddenly
   overtook him.

   That which principally moved Gregory to return to Rome was the flame of
   rebellion which filled Central and Northern Italy, and threatened the
   papacy with the permanent loss of its dominions. The election of an
   anti-pope was contemplated by the Italians, as a delegation from Rome
   informed him. One remedy was open to crush revolt on the banks of the
   Tiber. It was the presence of the pope himself. [234]

   Gregory had carried on war for five years with the disturbing elements
   in Italy. In the northern parts of the peninsula, political anarchy
   swept from city to city. Soldiers of fortune, the most famous of whom
   was the Englishman, John Hawkwood, spread terror wherever they went. In
   Milan, the tyrant Bernabo was all-powerful and truculent. In Florence,
   the revolt was against the priesthood itself, and a red flag was
   unfurled, on which was inscribed the word "Liberty." A league of 80
   cities was formed to abolish the pope's secular power. The interdict
   hurled against the Florentines, March 31, 1376, for the part they were
   taking in the sedition, contained atrocious clauses, giving every one
   the right to plunder the city and to make slaves of her people wherever
   they might be found. [235] Genoa and Pisa followed Florence and
   incurred a like papal malediction. The papal city, Bologna, was
   likewise stirred to rebellion in 1376 by its sister city on the Arno.

   Florence fanned the flames of rebellion in Rome and the other papal
   towns, calling upon them to throw off the yoke of tyranny and return to
   their pristine liberty. What Italian, its manifesto proclaimed, "can
   endure the sight of so many noble cities, serving barbarians appointed
   by the pope to devour the goods of Italy?" [236] But Rome remained true
   to the pope, as did Ancona. On the other hand, Perugia, Narni, Viterbo,
   and Ferrara, in 1375, raised the banner of rebellion until revolt
   threatened to spread over the whole of the papal patrimony. The bitter
   feeling against the French officials was intensified by a detachment of
   10,000 Breton mercenaries which the pope sent to crush the revolution.
   They were under the leadership of Cardinal Robert of Geneva,--afterward
   Clement VII.,--an iron-hearted soldier and pitiless priest. It was as
   plain as day, Pastor says, that Gregory's return was the only thing
   that could save Rome to the papacy.

   To the urgency of these civil commotions were added the pure voices of
   prophetesses, which rose above the confused sounds of revolt and arms,
   the voices of Brigitta of Sweden and Catherine of Siena, both canonized
   saints.

   Petrarch, who for nearly half a century had been urging the pope's
   return, now, in his last days, replied to a French advocate who
   compared Rome to Jericho, the town to which the man was going who fell
   among thieves, and stigmatized Avignon as the sewer of the earth. He
   died 1374, without seeing the consuming desire of his life fulfilled.
   Guided by patriotic instincts, he had carried into his appeals the
   feeling of an Italian's love of his country. Brigitta and Catherine
   made their appeals to Gregory on higher than national grounds, the
   utility of Christendom and the advantage of the kingdom of God.
   Emerging from visions and ecstatic moods of devotion, they called upon
   the Church's chief bishop to be faithful to the obligations of his holy
   office.

   On the death of her husband, St. Brigitta left her Scandinavian home
   and joined the pilgrims whose faces were set towards Rome in the
   Jubilee year of 1350. [237] Arriving in the papal city, the hope of
   seeing both the emperor and the pope once more in that centre of
   spiritual and imperial power moved her to the devotions of the saint
   and the messages of the seer. She spent her time in going from church
   to church and ministering to the sick, or sat clad in pilgrim's garb,
   begging. Her revelations, which were many, brought upon her the
   resentment of the Romans. She saw Urban enter the city and, when he
   announced his purpose to return again to France, she raised her voice
   in prediction of his speedy death, in case he persisted in it. When
   Gregory ascended the throne, she warned him that he would die
   prematurely if he kept away from the residence divinely appointed for
   the supreme pontiff. But to her, also, it was not given to see the
   fulfilment of her desire. The worldliness of the popes stirred her to
   bitter complaints. Peter, she exclaimed, "was appointed pastor and
   minister of Christ's sheep, but the pope scatters them and lacerates
   them. He is worse than Lucifer, more unjust than Pilate, more cruel
   than Judas. Peter ascended the throne in humility, Boniface in pride."
   To Gregory she wrote, "in thy curia arrogant pride rules, insatiable
   cupidity and execrable luxury. It is the very deepest gulf of horrible
   simony. [238] Thou seizest and tearest from the Lord innumerable
   sheep." And yet she was worthy to be declared a saint. She died in
   1373. Her daughter Catherine took the body to Sweden.

   Catherine of Siena was more fortunate. She saw the papacy
   re-established in Italy, but she also witnessed the unhappy beginnings
   of the schism. This Tuscan prophetess, called by a sober Catholic
   historian, "one of the most wonderful appearances in history," [239]
   wrote letter after letter to Gregory XI. whom she called "sweet Christ
   on earth," appealing to him and admonishing him to do his duty as the
   head of the Church, and to break away from his exile, which she
   represented as the source of all the evils with which Christendom was
   afflicted. "Be a true successor of St. Gregory," she wrote. "Love God.
   Do not bind yourself to your parents and your friends. Do not be held
   by the compulsion of your surroundings. Aid will come from God." His
   return to Rome and the starting of a new crusade against the Turks, she
   represented as necessary conditions of efficient measures to reform the
   Church. She bade him return "swiftly like a gentle lamb. Respond to the
   Holy Spirit who calls you. I tell you, Come, come, come, and do not
   wait for time, since time does not wait for you. Then you will do like
   the Lamb slain, whose place you hold, who, without weapons in his
   hands, slew our foes. Be manly in my sight, not fearful. Answer God,
   who calls you to hold and possess the seat of the glorious shepherd,
   St. Peter, whose vicar you are." [240]

   Gregory received a letter purporting to come from a man of God, warning
   him of the poison which awaited him at Rome and appealing to his
   timidity and his love of his family. In a burning epistle, Catherine
   showed that only the devil or one of his emissaries could be the author
   of such a communication, and called upon him as a good shepherd to pay
   more honor to God and the well-being of his flock than to his own
   safety, for a good shepherd, if necessary, lays down his life for the
   sheep. The servants of God are not in the habit of giving up a
   spiritual act for fear of bodily harm. [241]

   In 1376, Catherine saw Gregory face to face in Avignon, whither she
   went as a commissioner from Florence to arrange a peace between the
   city and the pope. The papal residence she found not a paradise of
   heavenly virtues, as she expected, but in it the stench of infernal
   vices. [242] The immediate object of the mission was not accomplished;
   but her unselfish appeals confirmed Gregory in his decision to return
   to Rome--a decision he had already formed before Catherine's visit, as
   the pope's own last words indicate. [243]

   As early as 1374, Gregory wrote to the emperor that it was his
   intention to re-establish the papacyon the Tiber. [244] A member of the
   papal household, Bertrand Raffini, was sent ahead to prepare the
   Vatican for his reception. The journey was delayed. It was hard for the
   pope to get away from France. His departure was vigorously resisted by
   his relatives as well as by the French cardinals and the French king,
   who sent n delegation to Avignon, headed by his brother, the duke of
   Anjou, to dissuade Gregory from his purpose.

   The journey was begun Sept. 13, 1376. Six cardinals were left behind at
   Avignon to take care of the papal business. The fleet which sailed from
   Marseilles was provided by Joanna of Naples, Peter IV. of Aragon, the
   Knights of St. John, and the Italian republics, but the vessels were
   not sufficient to carry the large party and the heavy cargo of personal
   baggage and supplies. The pope was obliged to rent a number of
   additional galleys and boats. Fernandez of Heredia, who had just been
   elected grand-master of the Knights of St. John, acted as admiral. A
   strong force of mercenaries was also required for protection by sea and
   at the frequent stopping places along the coast, and for service, if
   necessary, in Rome itself. The expenses of this peaceful
   Armada--vessels, mercenaries, and cargo--are carefully tabulated in the
   ledgers preserved in Avignon and the Vatican. [245] The first entries
   of expense are for the large consignments of Burgundy and other wines
   which were to be used on the way, or stored away in the vaults of the
   Vatican. [246] The cost of the journey was heavy, and it should
   occasion no surprise that the pope was obliged to increase the funds at
   his control at this time by borrowing 30,000 gold florins from the king
   of Navarre. [247] The papal moneys, amounting to 85,713 florins, were
   carried from Avignon to Marseilles in twelve chests on pack horses and
   mules, and in boats. To this amount were added later 41,527 florins,
   or, in all, about $300,000 of our present coinage. The cost of the
   boats and mercenaries was very large, and several times the boatmen
   made increased demands for their services and craft to which the papal
   party was forced to accede. Raymund of Turenne, who was in command of
   the mercenaries, received 700 florins a month for his "own person,"
   each captain with a banner 24 florins, and each lance with three men
   under him 18 florins monthly. Nor were the obligations of charity to be
   overlooked. Durandus Andreas, the papal eleemosynary, received 100
   florins to be distributed in alms on the journey, and still another 100
   to be distributed after the party's arrival at Rome. [248]

   The elements seemed to war with the expedition. The fleet had no sooner
   set sail from Marseilles than a fierce storm arose which lasted several
   weeks and made the journey tedious. Urban V. was three days in reaching
   Genoa, Gregory sixteen. From Genoa, the vessels continued southwards
   the full distance to Ostia, anchorage being made every night off towns.
   From Ostia, Gregory went up the Tiber by boat, landing at Rome Dec. 16,
   1377. The journey was made by night and the banks were lit up by
   torches, showing the feverish expectation of the people. Disembarking
   at St. Paul's, the pope proceeded the next day, Jan. 17, to St.
   Peter's, accompanied by rejoicing throngs. In the procession were bands
   of buffoons who added to the interest of the spectacle and afforded
   pastime to the populace. The pope abode in the Vatican and, from that
   time till this day, it has continued to be the papal residence.

   Gregory survived his entrance into the Eternal City a single year. He
   spent the warmer months in Anagni, where he must have had mixed
   feelings as he recalled the experiences of his predecessor Boniface
   VIII., which had been the immediate cause of the transfer of the papal
   residence to French soil. The atrocities practised at Cesena by
   Cardinal Robert cast a dark shadow over the events of the year. An
   uprising of the inhabitants in consequence of the brutality of his
   Breton troops drove them and the cardinal to seek refuge in the
   citadel. Hawkwood was called in, and, in spite of the cardinal's
   pacific assurances, the mercenaries fell upon the defenceless people
   and committed a butchery whose shocking details made the ears of all
   Italy to tingle. Four thousand were put to death, including friars in
   their churches, and still other thousands were sent forth naked and
   cold to find what refuge they could in neighboring towns. But, in spite
   of this barbarity, the pope's authority was acknowledged by an
   enlarging circle of Italian commonwealths, including Bologna. Florence,
   even, sued for peace.

   When Gregory died, March 27, 1378, he was only 47 years old. By his
   request, his body was laid to rest in S. Maria Nuova on the Forum. In
   his last hours, he is said to have regretted having given his ear to
   the voice of Catherine of Siena, and he admonished the cardinals not to
   listen to prophecies as he had done. [249] Nevertheless, the monument
   erected to Gregory at Rome two hundred years later is true to history
   in representing Catherine of Siena walking at the pope's side as if
   conducting him back to Rome. The Babylonian captivity of the papacy had
   lasted nearly three-quarters of a century. The wonder is that with the
   pope virtually a vassal of France, Western Christendom remained united.
   Scarcely anything in history seems more unnatural than the voluntary
   residence of the popes in the commonplace town on the Rhone remote from
   the burial-place of the Apostles and from the centres of European life.

   viii, 7 sq., and other Catholic historians agree that this was
   Gregory's chief motive. Mirot, pp. 10-18, ascribes to Gregory three
   controlling ideas--the reform of the Church, the re-establishment of
   peace with the East as a preliminary to a new crusade against the
   Turks, and the return of the papacy to Rome.

   § 13. The Schism Begun. 1378.

   The death of Gregory XI. was followed by the schism of Western
   Christendom, which lasted forty years, and proved to be a greater
   misfortune for the Church than the Avignon captivity. Anti-popes the
   Church had had, enough of them since the days of Gregory VII., from
   Wibert of Ravenna chosen by the will of Henry IV. to the feeble Peter
   of Corbara, elected under Lewis the Bavarian. Now, two lines of popes,
   each elected by a college of cardinals, reigned, the one at Rome, the
   other in Avignon, and both claiming to be in the legitimate succession
   from St. Peter.

   Gregory XI. foresaw the confusion that was likely to follow at his
   death, and sought to provide against the catastrophe of a disputed
   election, and probably also to insure the choice of a French pope, by
   pronouncing in advance an election valid, no matter where the conclave
   might be held. The rule that the conclave should convene in the
   locality where the pontiff died, was thus set aside. Gregory knew well
   the passionate feeling in Rome against the return of the papacy to the
   banks of the Rhone. A clash was almost inevitable. While the pope lay
   a-dying, the cardinals at several sittings attempted to agree upon his
   successor, but failed.

   On April 7, 1378, ten days after Gregory's death, the conclave met in
   the Vatican, and the next day elected the Neapolitan, Bartholomew
   Prignano, archbishop of Bari. Of the sixteen cardinals present, four
   were Italians, eleven Frenchmen, and one Spaniard, Peter de Luna, who
   later became famous as Benedict XIII. The French party was weakened by
   the absence of the six cardinals, left behind at Avignon, and still
   another was absent. Of the Italians, two were Romans, Tebaldeschi, an
   old man, and Giacomo Orsini, the youngest member of the college. The
   election of an Italian not a member of the curia was due to factions
   which divided the French and to the compulsive attitude of the Roman
   populace, which insisted upon an Italian for pope.

   The French cardinals were unable to agree upon a candidate from their
   own number. One of the two parties into which they were split, the
   Limousin party, to which Gregory XI. and his predecessors had belonged,
   numbered six cardinals. The Italian mob outside the Vatican was as much
   a factor in the situation as the divisions in the conclave itself. A
   scene of wild and unrestrained turbulence prevailed in the square of
   St. Peter's. The crowd pressed its way into the very spaces of the
   Vatican, and with difficulty a clearing was made for the entrance of
   all the cardinals. To prevent the exit of the cardinals, the Banderisi,
   or captains of the thirteen districts into which Rome was divided, had
   taken possession of the city and closed the gates. The mob, determined
   to keep the papacy on the Tiber, filled the air with angry shouts and
   threats. "We will have a Roman for pope or at least an
   ltalian."--Romano, romano, lo volemo, o almanco Italiano was the cry.
   On the first night soldiers clashed their spears in the room underneath
   the chamber where the conclave was met, and even thrust them through
   the ceiling. A fire of combustibles was lighted under the window. The
   next morning, as their excellencies were saying the mass of the Holy
   Spirit and engaged in other devotions, the noises became louder and
   more menacing. One cardinal, d'Aigrefeuille, whispered to Orsini,
   "better elect the devil than die."

   It was under such circumstances that the archbishop of Bari was chosen.
   After the choice had been made, and while they were waiting to get the
   archbishop's consent, six of the cardinals dined together and seemed to
   be in good spirits. But the mob's impatience to know what had been done
   would brook no delay, and Orsini, appearing at the window, cried out
   "go to St. Peter." This was mistaken for an announcement that old
   Tebaldeschi, cardinal of St. Peter's, had been chosen, and a rush was
   made for the cardinal's palace to loot it, as the custom was when a
   cardinal was elected pope. The crowd surged through the Vatican and
   into the room where the cardinals had been meeting and, as Valois puts
   it, "the pillage of the conclave had begun." To pacify the mob, two of
   the cardinals, half beside themselves with fright, pointed to
   Tebaldeschi, set him up on a chair, placed a white mitre on his head,
   and threw a red cloak over his shoulders. The old man tried to indicate
   that he was not the right person. But the throngs continued to bend
   down before him in obeisance for several hours, till it became known
   that the successful candidate was Prignano.

   In the meantime the rest of the cardinals forsook the building and
   sought refuge, some within the walls of St. Angelo, and four by flight
   beyond the walls of the city. The real pope was waiting for recognition
   while the members of the electing college were fled. But by the next
   day the cardinals had sufficiently regained their self-possession to
   assemble again,--all except the four who had put the city walls behind
   them,--and Cardinal Peter de Vergne, using the customary formula,
   proclaimed to the crowd through the window: "I announce to you a great
   joy. You have a pope, and he calls himself Urban VI." The new pontiff
   was crowned on April 18, in front of St. Peter's, by Cardinal Orsini.

   The archbishop had enjoyed the confidence of Gregory XI. He enjoyed a
   reputation for austere morals and strict conformity to the rules of
   fasting and other observances enjoined by the Church. He wore a hair
   shirt, and was accustomed to retire with the Bible in his hand. At the
   moment of his election no doubt was expressed as to its validity.
   Nieheim, who was in the city at the time, declared that Urban was
   canonical pope-elect. "This is the truth," he wrote, "and no one can
   honestly deny it." [250] All the cardinals in Rome yielded Urban
   submission, and in a letter dated May 8 they announced to the emperor
   and all Christians the election and coronation. The cardinals at
   Avignon wrote acknowledging him, and ordered the keys to the castle of
   St. Angelo placed in his hands. It is probable that no one would have
   thought of denying Urban's rights if the pope had removed to Avignon,
   or otherwise yielded to the demands of the French members of the curia.
   His failure to go to France, Urban declared to be the cause of the
   opposition to him.

   Seldom has so fine an opportunity been offered to do a worthy thing and
   to win a great name as was offered to Urban VI. It was the opportunity
   to put an end to the disturbance in the Church by maintaining the
   residence of the papacy in its ancient seat, and restoring to it the
   dignity which it had lost by its long exile. Urban, however, was not
   equal to the occasion, and made an utter failure. He violated all the
   laws of common prudence and tact. His head seemed to be completely
   turned. He estranged and insulted his cardinals. He might have made
   provision for a body of warm supporters by the prompt appointment of
   new members to the college, but even this measure he failed to take
   till it was too late. The French king, it is true, was bent upon having
   the papacy return to French soil, and controlled the French cardinals.
   But a pope of ordinary shrewdness was in position to foil the king.
   This quality Urban VI. lacked, and the sacred college, stung by his
   insults, came to regard him as an intruder in St. Peter's chair.

   In his concern for right living, Urban early took occasion in a public
   allocution to reprimand the cardinals for their worldliness and for
   living away from their sees. He forbade their holding more than a
   single appointment and accepting gifts from princes. To their demand
   that Avignon continue to be the seat of the papacy, Urban brusquely
   told them that Rome and the papacy were joined together, and he would
   not separate them. As the papacy belonged not to France but to the
   whole world, he would distribute the promotions to the sacred college
   among the nations.

   Incensed at the attack made upon their habits and perquisites, and upon
   their national sympathies, the French cardinals, giving the heat of the
   city as the pretext, removed one by one to Anagni, while Urban took up
   his summer residence at Tivoli. His Italian colleagues followed him,
   but they also went over to the French. No pope had ever been left more
   alone. Forming a compact body, the French members of the curia demanded
   the pope's resignation. The Italians, who at first proposed the calling
   of a council, acquiesced. The French seceders then issued a
   declaration, dated Aug. 2, in which Urban was denounced as an apostate,
   and his election declared void in view of the duress under which it was
   accomplished. [251] It asserted that the cardinals at the time were in
   mortal terror from the Romans. Now that he would not resign, they
   anathematized him. Urban replied in a document called the Factum,
   insisting upon the validity of his election. Retiring to Fondi, in
   Neapolitan territory, the French cardinals proceeded to a new eIection,
   Sept. 20, 1378, the choice falling upon one of their number, Robert of
   Geneva, the son of Amadeus, count of Geneva. He was one of those who,
   four months before, had pointed out Tebaldeschi to the Roman mob. The
   three Italian cardinals, though they did not actively participate in
   the election, offered no resistance. Urban is said to have received the
   news with tears, and to have expressed regret for his untactful and
   self-willed course. Perhaps he recalled the fate of his
   fellow-Neapolitan, Peter of Murrhone, whose lack of worldly wisdom a
   hundred years before had lost him the papal crown. To establish himself
   on the papal throne, he appointed 29 cardinals. But it was too late to
   prevent the schism which Gregory XI. had feared and a wise ruler would
   have averted.

   Robert of Geneva, at the time of his election 36 years old, came to the
   papal honor with his hands red from the bloody massacre of Cesena. He
   had the reputation of being a politician and a fast liver. He was
   consecrated Oct. 31 under the name of Clement VII. It was a foregone
   conclusion that he would remove the papal seat back to Avignon. He
   first attempted to overthrow Urban on his own soil, but the attempt
   failed. Rome resisted, and the castle of St. Angelo, which was in the
   hands of his supporters, he lost, but not until its venerable walls
   were demolished, so that at a later time the very goats clambered over
   the stones. He secured the support of Joanna, and Louis of Anjou whom
   she had chosen as the heir of her kingdom, but the war which broke out
   between Urban and Naples fell out to Urban's advantage. The duke of
   Anjou was deposed, and Charles of Durazzo, of the royal house of
   Hungary, Joanna's natural heir, appointed as his successor. Joanna
   herself fell into Charles' hands and was executed, 1882, on the charge
   of having murdered her first husband. The duke of Brunswick was her
   fourth marital attempt. Clement VII. bestowed upon the duke of Anjou
   parts of the State of the Church and the high-sounding but empty title
   of duke of Adria. A portion of Urban's reward for crowning Charles,
   1881, was the lordship over Capria, Amalfi, Fondi, and other
   localities, which he bestowed upon his unprincipled and worthless
   nephew, Francis Prignano. In the war over Naples, the pope had made
   free use of the treasure of the Roman churches.

   Clement's cause in Italy was lost, and there was nothing for him to do
   but to fall back upon his supporter, Charles V. He returned to France
   by way of the sea and Marseilles.

   Thus the schism was completed, and Western Europe had the spectacle of
   two popes elected by the same college of cardinals without a dissenting
   voice, and each making full claims to the prerogative of the supreme
   pontiff of the Christian world. Each pope fulminated the severest
   judgments of heaven against the other. The nations of Europe and its
   universities were divided in their allegiance or, as it was called,
   their "obedience." The University of Paris, at first neutral, declared
   in favor of Robert of Geneva, [252] as did Savoy, the kingdoms of
   Spain, Scotland, and parts of Germany. England, Sweden, and the larger
   part of Italy supported Urban. The German emperor, Charles IV., was
   about to take the same side when he died, Nov. 29, 1378. Urban also had
   the vigorous support of Catherine of Siena. Hearing of the election
   which had taken place at Fondi she wrote to Urban: "I have heard that
   those devils in human form have resorted to an election. They have
   chosen not a vicar of Christ, but an anti-Christ. Never will I cease,
   dear father, to look upon you as Christ's true vicar on earth."

   The papal schism which Pastor has called "the greatest misfortune that
   could be thought of for the Church" [253] soon began to call forth
   indignant protests from the best men of the time. Western Christendom
   had never known such a scandal. The seamless coat of Christ was rent in
   twain, and Solomon's words could no longer be applied, "My dove is but
   One." [254] The divine claims of the papacy itself began to be matter
   of doubt. Writers like Wyclif made demands upon the pope to return to
   Apostolic simplicity of manners in sharp language such as no one had
   ever dared to use before. Many sees had two incumbents; abbeys, two
   abbots; parishes, two priests. The maintenance of two popes involved an
   increased financial burden, and both papal courts added to the old
   practices new inventions to extract revenue. Clement VII.'s agents went
   everywhere, striving to win support for his obedience, and the nations,
   taking advantage of the situation, magnified their authority to the
   detriment of the papal power.

   The following is a list of the popes of the Roman and Avignon lines,
   and the Pisan line whose legitimacy has now no advocates in the Roman
   communion.

   Roman Line

   Urban VI., 1378-1389.

   Boniface IX., 1389-1404.

   Innocent VII., 1404-1406.

   Gregory XII., 1406-1415.

   Deposed at Pisa, 1409. d. 1424 Resigned

   at Constance, 1415, d. 1417.

   Avignon Line

   Clement VII., 1378-1394.

   Benedict XIII., 1394-1409.

   Deposed at Pisa, 1409, and at

   Constance, 1417,.

   Pisan Line

   Alexander V., 1409-1410.

   John XXIII., 1410-1415.

   Martin V., 1417-1431.

   Acknowledged by the whole Latin Church.

   The question of the legitimacy of Urban VI.'s pontificate is still a
   matter of warm dispute. As neither pope nor council has given a
   decision on the question, Catholic scholars feel no constraint in
   discussing it. French writers have been inclined to leave the matter
   open. This was the case with Bossuet, Mansi, Martene, as it is with
   modern French writers. Valois hesitatingly, Salembier positively,
   decides for Urban. Historians, not moved by French sympathies,
   pronounce strongly in favor of the Roman line, as do Hefele, Funk,
   Hergenröther-Kirsch, Denifle, and Pastor. The formal recognition of
   Urban by all the cardinals and their official announcement of his
   election to the princes would seem to put the validity of his election
   beyond doubt. On the other hand, the declaratio sent forth by the
   cardinals nearly four months after Urban's election affirms that the
   cardinals were in fear of their lives when they voted; and according to
   the theory of the canon law, constraint invalidates an election as
   constraint invalidated Pascal II.'s concession to Henry V. It was the
   intention of the cardinals, as they affirm, to elect one of their
   number, till the tumult became so violent and threatening that to
   protect themselves they precipitately elected Prignano. They state that
   the people had even filled the air with the cry, "Let them be killed,"
   moriantur. A panic prevailed. When the tumult abated, the cardinals sat
   down to dine, and after dinner were about to proceed to a re-election,
   as they say, when the tumult again became threatening, and the doors of
   the room where they were sitting were broken open, so that they were
   forced to flee for their lives.

   To this testimony were added the depositions of individual cardinals
   later. Had Prignano proved complaisant to the wishes of the French
   party, there is no reason to suspect that the validity of his election
   would ever have been disputed. Up to the time when the vote was cast
   for Urban, the cardinals seem not to have been under duress from fear,
   but to have acted freely. After the vote had been cast, they felt their
   lives were in danger. [255] If the cardinals had proceeded to a second
   vote, as Valois has said, Urban might have been elected. The constant
   communications which passed between Charles V. and the French party at
   Anagni show him to have been a leading factor in the proceedings which
   followed and the reconvening of the conclave which elected Robert of
   Geneva. [256]

   On the other hand, the same body of cardinals which elected Urban
   deposed him, and, in their capacity as princes of the Church,
   unanimously chose Robert as his successor. The question of the
   authority of the sacred college to exercise this prerogative is still a
   matter of doubt. It received the abdication of Coelestine V. and
   elected a successor to him while he was still living. In that case,
   however, the papal throne became vacant by the supreme act of the pope
   himself.

   § 14. Further Progress of the Schism. 1378-1409.

   The territory of Naples remained the chief theatre of the conflict
   between the papal rivals, Louis of Anjou, who had the support of
   Clement VII., continuing to assert his claim to the throne. In 1383
   Urban secretly left Rome for Naples, but was there held in virtual
   confinement till he had granted Charles of Durazzo's demands. He then
   retired to Nocera, which belonged to his nephew. The measures taken by
   the cardinals at Anagni had taught him no lesson. His insane severity
   and self-will continued, and brought him into the danger of losing the
   papal crown. Six of his cardinals entered into a conspiracy to dethrone
   him, or at least to make him subservient to the curia. The plot was
   discovered, and Urban launched the interdict against Naples, whose king
   was supposed to have been a party to it. The offending cardinals were
   imprisoned in an old cistern, and afterwards subjected to the torture.
   [257] Forced to give up the town and to take refuge in the fortress,
   the relentless pontiff is said to have gone three or four times daily
   to the window, and, with candles burning and to the sound of a bell, to
   have solemnly pronounced the formula of excommunication against the
   besieging troops. Allowed to depart, and proceeding with the members of
   his household across the country, Urban reached Trani and embarked on a
   Genoese ship which finally landed him at Genoa, 1386. On the way, the
   crew threatened to carry him to Avignon, and had to be bought off by
   the unfortunate pontiff. Was ever a ruler in a worse predicament,
   beating about on the Mediterranean, than Urban! Five of the cardinals
   who had been dragged along in chains now met with a cruel end. Adam
   Aston, the English cardinal, Urban had released at the request of the
   English king. But towards the rest of the alleged conspirators he
   showed the heartless relentlessness of a tyrant. The chronicler
   Nieheim, who was with the pope at Naples and Nocera, declares that his
   heart was harder than granite. Different rumors were afloat concerning
   the death the prelates were subjected to, one stating they had been
   thrown into the sea, another that they had their heads cut off with an
   axe; another report ran that their bodies were buried in a stable after
   being covered with lime and then burnt.

   In the meantime, two of the prelates upon whom Urban had conferred the
   red hat, both Italians, went over to Clement VII. and were graciously
   received.

   Breaking away from Genoa, Urban went by way of Lucca to Perugia, and
   then with another army started off for Naples. Charles of Durazzo, who
   had been called to the throne of Hungary and murdered in 1386, was
   succeeded by his young son Ladislaus (1386~1414), but his claim was
   contested by the heir of Louis of Anjou (d. 1384). The pontiff got no
   farther than Ferentino, and turning back was carried in a carriage to
   Rome, where he again entered the Vatican, a few months before his
   death, Oct. 15, 1389.

   Bartholomew Prignano had disappointed every expectation. He was his own
   worst enemy. He was wholly lacking in common prudence and the spirit of
   conciliation. It is to his credit that, as Nieheim urges, he never made
   ecclesiastical preferment the object of sale. Whatever were his virtues
   before he received the tiara, he had as pope shown himself in every
   instance utterly unfit for the responsibilities of a ruler.

   Clement VII., who arrived in Avignon in June, 1379, stooped before the
   kings of France, Charles V. (d. 1380) and Charles VI. He was diplomatic
   and versatile where his rival was impolitic and intractable. He knew
   how to entertain at his table with elegance. [258] The distinguished
   preacher, Vincent Ferrer, gave him his support. Among the new cardinals
   he appointed was the young prince of Luxemburg, who enjoyed a great
   reputation for saintliness. At the prince's death, in 1387, miracles
   were said to be performed at his tomb, a circumstance which seemed to
   favor the claims of the Avignon pope.

   Clement's embassy to Bohemia for a while had hopes of securing a
   favorable declaration from the Bohemian king, Wenzil, but was
   disappointed. [259] The national pride of the French was Clement's
   chief dependence, and for the king's support he was obliged to pay a
   humiliating price by granting the royal demands to bestow
   ecclesiastical offices and tax Church property. As a means of healing
   the schism, Clement proposed a general council, promising, in case it
   decided in his favor, to recognize Urban as leading cardinal. The first
   schismatic pope died suddenly of apoplexy, Sept. 16, 1394, having
   outlived Urban VI. five years.

   Boniface IX., who succeeded Urban VI., was, like him, a Neapolitan, and
   only thirty-five at the time of his election. He was a man of fine
   presence, and understood the art of ruling, but lacked the culture of
   the schools, and could not even write, and was poor at saying the
   services. [260] He had the satisfaction of seeing the kingdom of Naples
   yield to the Roman obedience. He also secured from the city of Rome
   full submission, and the document, by which it surrendered to him its
   republican liberties, remained for centuries the foundation of the
   relations of the municipality to the Apostolic See. [261] Bologna,
   Perugia, Viterbo, and other towns of Italy which had acknowledged
   Clement, were brought into submission to him, so that before his death
   the entire peninsula was under his obedience except Genoa, which
   Charles VI. had reduced. All men's eyes began again to turn to Rome.

   In 1390, the Jubilee Year which Urban VI. had appointed attracted
   streams of pilgrims to Rome from Germany, Hungary, Bohemia, Poland, and
   England and other lands, as did also the Jubilee of 1400, commemorating
   the close of one and the beginning of another century. If Rome profited
   by these celebrations, Boniface also made in other ways the most of his
   opportunity, and his agents throughout Christendom returned with the
   large sums which they had realized from the sale of dispensations and
   indulgences. Boniface left behind him a reputation for avarice and
   freedom in the sale of ecclesiastical concessions. [262] He was also
   notorious for his nepotism, enriching his brothers Andrew and John and
   other relatives with offices and wealth. Such offences, however, the
   Romans could easily overlook in view of the growing regard throughout
   Europe for the Roman line of popes and the waning influence of the
   Avignon line.

   The preponderant influence of Ladislaus secured the election of still
   another Neapolitan, Cardinal Cosimo dei Migliorati, who took the name
   of Innocent VII. He also was only thirty-five years old at the time of
   his elevation to the papal chair, a doctor of both laws and expert in
   the management of affairs. The members of the conclave, before
   proceeding to an election, signed a document whereby each bound
   himself, if elected pope, to do all in his power to put an end to the
   schism. The English chronicler, Adam of Usk, who was present at the
   coronation, concludes the graphic description he gives of the
   ceremonies [263] with a lament over the desolate condition of the Roman
   city. How much is Rome to be pitied! he exclaims, "for, once thronged
   with princes and their palaces, she is now a place of hovels, thieves,
   wolves, worms, full of desert spots and laid waste by her own citizens
   who rend each other in pieces. Once her empire devoured the world with
   the sword, and now her priesthood devours it with mummery. Hence the
   lines --


   " 'The Roman bites at all, and those he cannot bite, he hates.

   Of rich he hears the call, but 'gainst the poor he shuts his gates.' "

   Following the example of his two predecessors, Innocent excommunicated
   the Avignon anti-pope and his cardinals, putting them into the same
   list with heretics, pirates, and brigands. In revenge for his nephew's
   cold-blooded slaughter of eleven of the chief men of the city, whose
   bodies he threw out of a window, he was driven from Rome, and after
   great hardships he reached Viterbo. But the Romans soon found
   Innocent's rule preferable to the rule of Ladislaus, king of Naples and
   papal protector, and he was recalled, the nephew whose hands were
   reeking with blood making public entry into the Vatican with his uncle.

   The last pope of the Roman line was Gregory XII. Angelo Correr,
   cardinal of St. Marks, Venice, elected 1406, was surpassed in tenacity
   as well as ability by the last of the Avignon popes, elected 1394, and
   better known as Peter de Luna of Aragon, one of the cardinals who
   joined in the revolt against Urban VI. and in the election of Clement
   VII. at Fondi.

   Under these two pontiffs the controversy over the schism grew more and
   more acute and the scandal more and more intolerable. The nations of
   Western Europe were weary of the open and flagitious traffic in
   benefices and other ecclesiastical privileges, the fulminations of one
   pope against the other, and the division of sees and parishes between
   rival claimants. The University of Paris took the leading part in
   agitating remedial measures, and in the end the matter was taken wholly
   out of the hands of the two popes. The cardinals stepped into the
   foreground and, in the face of all canonical precedent, took the course
   which ultimately resulted in the reunion of the Church under one head.

   Before Gregory's election, the Roman cardinals, numbering fourteen,
   again entered into a compact stipulating that the successful candidate
   should by all means put an end to the schism, even, if necessary, by
   the abdication of his office. Gregory was fourscore at the time, and
   the chief consideration which weighed in his choice was that in men
   arrived at his age ambition usually runs low, and that Gregory would be
   more ready to deny himself for the good of the Church than a younger
   man.

   Peter de Luna, one of the most vigorous personalities who have ever
   claimed the papal dignity, had the spirit and much of the ability of
   Hildebrand and his namesake, Gregory IX. But it was his bad star to be
   elected in the Avignon and not in the Roman succession. Had he been in
   the Roman line, he would probably have made his mark among the great
   ruling pontiffs. His nationality also was against him. The French had
   little heart in supporting a Spaniard and, at Clement's death, the
   relations between the French king and the Avignon pope at once lost
   their cordiality. Peter was energetic of mind and in action, a shrewd
   observer, magnified his office, and never yielded an inch in the matter
   of papal prerogative. Through the administrations of three Roman
   pontiffs, he held on firmly to his office, outlived the two Reformatory
   councils of Pisa and Constance, and yielded not up this mortal flesh
   till the close of the first quarter of the fifteenth century, and was
   still asserting his claims and maintaining the dignity of pope at the
   time of his death. Before his election, he likewise entered into a
   solemn compact with his cardinals, promising to bend every effort to
   heal the unholy schism, even if the price were his own abdication.

   The professions of both popes were in the right direction. They were
   all that could be desired, and all that remained was for either of them
   or for both of them to resign and make free room for a new candidate.
   The problem would thus have been easily settled, and succeeding
   generations might have canonized both pontiffs for their voluntary
   self-abnegation. But it took ten years to bring Gregory to this state
   of mind, and then almost the last vestige of power had been taken from
   him. Peter de Luna never yielded.

   Undoubtedly, at the time of the election of Gregory XII., the papacy
   was passing through one of the grave crises in its history. There were
   not wanting men who said, like Langenstein, vice-chancellor of the
   University of Paris, that perhaps it was God's purpose that there
   should be two popes indefinitely, even as David's kingdom was divided
   under two sovereigns. [264] Yea, and there were men who argued publicly
   that it made little difference how many there were, two or three, or
   ten or twelve, or as many as there were nations. [265]

   At his first consistory Gregory made a good beginning, when he asserted
   that, for the sake of the good cause of securing a united Christendom,
   he was willing to travel by land or by sea, by land, if necessary, with
   a pilgrim's staff, by sea in a fishing smack, in order to come to an
   agreement with Benedict. He wrote to his rival on the Rhone, declaring
   that, like the woman who was ready to renounce her child rather than
   see it cut asunder, so each of them should be willing to cede his
   authority rather than be responsible for the continuance of the schism.
   He laid his hand on the New Testament and quoted the words that "he who
   exalteth himself shall be abased, and he that humbleth himself shall be
   exalted." He promised to abdicate, if Benedict would do the same, that
   the cardinals of both lines might unite together in a new election; and
   he further promised not to add to the number of his cardinals, except
   to keep the number equal to the number of the Avignon college.

   Benedict's reply was shrewd, if not equally demonstrative. He, too,
   lamented the schism, which he pronounced detestable, wretched, and
   dreadful, [266] but gently setting aside Gregory's blunt proposal,
   suggested as the best resort the via discussionis, or the path of
   discussion, and that the cardinals of both lines should meet together,
   talk the matter over, and see what should be done, and then, if
   necessary, one or both popes might abdicate. Both popes in their
   communications called themselves "servant of the servants of God."
   Gregory addressed Benedict as "Peter de Luna, whom some peoples in this
   wretched--miserabili -- schism call Benedict XIII."; and Benedict
   addressed the pope on the Tiber as "Angelus Correr, whom some, adhering
   to him in this most destructive--pernicioso -- schism, call Gregory
   XII." "We are both old men," wrote Benedict. "Time is short; hasten,
   and do not delay in this good cause. Let us both embrace the ways of
   salvation and peace."

   Nothing could have been finer, but it was quickly felt that while both
   popes expressed themselves as ready to abdicate, positive as the
   professions of both were, each wanted to have the advantage when the
   time came for the election of the new pontiff to rule over the reunited
   Church.

   As early as 1381, the University of Paris appealed to the king of
   France to insist upon the calling of a general council as the way to
   terminate the schism. But the duke of Anjou had the spokesman of the
   university, Jean Ronce, imprisoned, and the university was commanded to
   keep silence on the subject.

   Prior to this appeal, two individuals had suggested the same idea,
   Konrad of Gelnhausen, and Henry of Langenstein, otherwise known as
   Henry of Hassia. Konrad, who wrote in 1380, [267] and whose views led
   straight on to the theory of the supreme authority of councils, [268]
   affirmed that there were two heads of the Church, and that Christ never
   fails it, even though the earthly head may fail by death or error. The
   Church is not the pope and the cardinals, but the body of the faithful,
   and this body gets its inner life directly from Christ, and is so far
   infallible. In this way he answers those who were forever declaring
   that in the absence of the pope's call there would be no council, even
   if all the prelates were assembled, but only a conventicle.

   In more emphatic terms, Henry of Langenstein, in 1381, justified the
   calling of a council without the pope's intervention. [269] The
   institution of the papacy by Christ, he declared, did not involve the
   idea that the action of the pope was always necessary, either in
   originating or consenting to legislation. The Church might have
   instituted the papacy, even had Christ not appointed it. If the
   cardinals should elect a pontiff not agreeable to the Church, the
   Church might set their choice aside. The validity of a council did not
   depend upon the summons or the ratification of a pope. Secular princes
   might call such a synod. A general council, as the representative of
   the entire Church, is above the cardinals, yea, above the pope himself.
   Such a council cannot err, but the cardinals and the pope may err.

   The views of Langenstein, vice-chancellor of the University of Paris,
   represented the views of the faculties of that institution. They were
   afterwards advocated by John Gerson, one of the most influential men of
   his century, and one of the most honored of all the centuries. Among
   those who took the opposite view was the English Dominican and
   confessor of Benedict XIII., John Hayton. The University of Paris he
   called "a daughter of Satan, mother of error, sower of sedition, and
   the pope's defamer, "and declared the pope was to be forced by no human
   tribunal, but to follow God and his own conscience.

   In 1394, the University of Paris proposed three methods of healing the
   schism [270] which became the platform over which the issue was
   afterwards discussed, namely, the via cessionis, or the abdication of
   both popes, the via compromissi, an adjudication of the claims of both
   by a commission, and the via synodi, or the convention of a general
   council to which the settlement of the whole matter should be left. No
   act in the whole history of this famous literary institution has given
   it wider fame than this proposal, coupled with the activity it
   displayed to bring the schism to a close. The method preferred by its
   faculties was the first, the abdication of both popes, which it
   regarded as the simplest remedy. It was suggested that the new
   election, after the popes had abdicated, should be consummated by the
   cardinals in office at the time of Gregory XI.'s decease, 1378, and
   still surviving, or by a union of the cardinals of both obediences.

   The last method, settlement by a general council, which the university
   regarded as offering the most difficulty, it justified on the ground
   that the pope is subject to the Church as Christ was subject to his
   mother and Joseph. The authority of such a council lay in its
   constitution according to Christ's words, "where two or three are
   gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them." Its
   membership should consist of doctors of theology and the laws taken
   from the older universities, and deputies of the orders, as well as
   bishops, many of whom were uneducated,--illiterati. [271]

   Clement VII. showed his displeasure with the university by forbidding
   its further intermeddling, and by condemning his cardinals who, without
   his permission, had met and recommended him to adopt one of the three
   ways. At Clement's death the king of France called upon the Avignon
   college to postpone the election of a successor, but, surmising the
   contents of the letter, they prudently left it unopened until they had
   chosen Benedict XIII. Benedict at once manifested the warmest zeal in
   the healing of the schism, and elaborated his plan for meeting with
   Boniface IX., and coming to some agreement with him. These friendly
   propositions were offset by a summons from the king's delegates,
   calling upon the two pontiffs to abdicate, and all but two of the
   Avignon cardinals favored the measure. But Benedict declared that such
   a course would seem to imply constraint, and issued a bull against it.

   The two parties continued to express deep concern for the healing of
   the schism, but neither would yield. Benedict gained the support of the
   University of Toulouse, and strengthened himself by the promotion of
   Peter d'Ailly, chancellor of the University of Paris, to the
   episcopate. The famous inquisitor, Nicolas Eymericus, also one of his
   cardinals, was a firm advocate of Benedict's divine claims. The
   difficulties were increased by the wavering course of Charles VI.,
   1380-1412, a man of feeble mind, and twice afflicted with insanity,
   whose brothers and uncles divided the rule of the kingdom amongst
   themselves. French councils attempted to decide upon a course for the
   nation to pursue, and a third council, meeting in Paris, 1398, and
   consisting of 11 archbishops and 60 bishops, all theretofore supporters
   of the Avignon pope, decided upon the so-called subtraction of
   obedience from Benedict. In spite of these discouragements, Benedict
   continued loyal to himself. He was forsaken by his cardinals and
   besieged by French troops in his palace and wounded. The spectacle of
   his isolation touched the heart and conscience of the French people,
   and the decree ordering the subtraction of obedience was annulled by
   the national parliament of 1403, which professed allegiance anew, and
   received from him full absolution.

   When Gregory XII. was elected in 1406, the controversy over the schism
   was at white heat. England, Castile, and the German king, Wenzil, had
   agreed to unite with France in bringing it to an end. Pushed by the
   universal clamor, by the agitation of the University of Paris, and
   especially by the feeling which prevailed in France, Gregory and
   Benedict saw that the situation was in danger of being controlled by
   other hands than their own, and agreed to meet at Savona on the Gulf of
   Genoa to discuss their differences. In October, 1407, Benedict,
   attended by a military guard, went as far as Porto Venere and Savona.
   Gregory got as far as Lucca, when he declined to go farther, on the
   plea that Savona was in territory controlled by the French and on other
   pretexts. Nieheim represents the Roman pontiff as dissimulating during
   the whole course of the proceedings and as completely under the
   influence of his nephews and other favorites, who imposed upon the
   weakness of the old man, and by his doting generosity were enabled to
   live in luxury. At Lucca they spent their time in dancing and
   merry-making. This writer goes on to say that Gregory put every
   obstacle in the way of union. [272] He is represented by another writer
   as having spent more in bonbons than his predecessors did for their
   wardrobes and tables, and as being only a shadow with bones and skin.
   [273]

   Benedict's support was much weakened by the death of the king's
   brother, the duke of Orleans, who had been his constant supporter.
   France threatened neutrality, and Benedict, fearing seizure by the
   French commander at Genoa, beat a retreat to Perpignan, a fortress at
   the foot of the Pyrenees, six miles from the Mediterranean. In May of
   the same year France again decreed "subtraction," and a national French
   assembly in 1408 approved the calling of a council. The last stages of
   the contest were approaching.

   Seven of Gregory's cardinals broke away from him, and, leaving him at
   Lucca, went to Pisa, where they issued a manifesto appealing from a
   poorly informed pope to a better informed one, from Christ's vicar to
   Christ himself, and to the decision of a general council. Two more
   followed. Gregory further injured his cause by breaking his solemn
   engagement and appointing four cardinals, May, 1408, two of them his
   nephews, and a few months later he added ten more. Cardinals of the
   Avignon obedience joined the Roman cardinals at Pisa and brought the
   number up to thirteen. Retiring to Livorno on the beautiful Italian
   lake of that name, and acting as if the popes were deposed, they as
   rulers of the Church appointed a general council to meet at Pisa, March
   25, 1409.

   As an offset, Gregory summoned a council of his own to meet in the
   territory either of Ravenna or Aquileja. Many of his closest followers
   had forsaken him, and even his native city of Venice withdrew from him
   its support. In the meantime Ladislaus had entered Rome and been hailed
   as king. It is, however, probable that this was with the consent of
   Gregory himself, who hoped thereby to gain sympathy for his cause.
   Benedict also exercised his sovereign power as pontiff and summoned a
   council to meet at Perpignan, Nov. 1, 1408.

   The word "council," now that the bold initiative was taken, was hailed
   as pregnant with the promise of sure relief from the disgrace and
   confusion into which Western Christendom had been thrown and of a
   reunion of the Church.

   § 15. The Council of Pisa.

   The three councils of Pisa, 1409, Constance, 1414, and Basel, 1431, of
   which the schism was the occasion, are known in history as the
   Reformatory councils. Of the tasks they set out to accomplish, the
   healing of the schism and the institution of disciplinary reforms in
   the Church, the first they accomplished, but with the second they made
   little progress. They represent the final authority of general councils
   in the affairs of the Church--a view, called the conciliary theory--in
   distinction from the supreme authority of the papacy.

   The Pisan synod marks an epoch in the history of Western Christendom
   not so much on account of what it actually accomplished as because it
   was the first revolt in council against the theory of papal absolutism
   which had been accepted for centuries. It followed the ideas of Gerson
   and Langenstein, namely, that the Church is the Church even without the
   presence of a pope, and that an oecumenical council is legitimate which
   meets not only in the absence of his assent but in the face of his
   protest. Representing intellectually the weight of the Latin world and
   the larger part of its constituency, the assembly was a momentous event
   leading in the opposite direction from the path laid out by Hildebrand,
   Innocent III., and their successors. It was a mighty blow at the old
   system of Church government.

   While Gregory XII. was tarrying at Rimini, as a refugee, under the
   protection of Charles Malatesta, and Benedict XIII. was confined to the
   seclusion of Perpignan, the synod was opened on the appointed day in
   the cathedral of Pisa. There was an imposing attendance of 14
   cardinals,--the number being afterwards increased to 24,--4 patriarchs,
   10 archbishops, 79 bishops and representatives of 116 other bishops,
   128 abbots and priors and the representatives of 200 other abbots. To
   these prelates were added the generals of the Dominican, Franciscan,
   Carmelite, and Augustinian orders, the grand-master of the Knights of
   St. John, who was accompanied by 6 commanders, the general of the
   Teutonic order, 300 doctors of theology and the canon law, 109
   representatives of cathedral and collegiate chapters, and the deputies
   of many princes, including the king of the Romans, Wenzil, and the
   kings of England, France, Poland, and Cyprus. A new and significant
   feature was the representation of the universities of learning,
   including Paris, [274] Bologna, Oxford and Cambridge, Montpellier,
   Toulouse, Angers, Vienna, Cracow, Prag, and Cologne. Among the most
   important personages was Peter d'Ailly, though there is no indication
   in the acts of the council that he took a prominent public part. John
   Gerson seems not to have been present.

   The second day, the archbishop of Milan, Philargi, himself soon to be
   elected pope, preached from Judg. 20:7: "Behold, ye are all children of
   Israel. Give here your advice and counsel," and stated the reasons
   which had led to the summoning of the council. Guy de Maillesec, the
   only cardinal surviving from the days prior to the schism, presided
   over the first sessions. His place was then filled by the patriarch of
   Alexandria, till the new pope was chosen.

   One of the first deliverances was a solemn profession of the Holy
   Trinity and the Catholic faith, and that every heretic and schismatic
   will share with the devil and his angels the burnings of eternal fire
   unless before the end of this life he make his peace with the Catholic
   Church. [275]

   The business which took precedence of all other was the healing of the
   schism, the causa unionis, as, it was called, and disposition was first
   made of the rival popes. A formal trial was instituted, which was
   opened by two cardinals and two archbishops proceeding to the door of
   the cathedral and solemnly calling Gregory and Benedict by name and
   summoning them to appear and answer for themselves. The formality was
   gone through three times, on three successive days, and the offenders
   were given till April 15 to appear.

   By a series of declarations the synod then justified its existence, and
   at the eighth session declared itself to be "a general council
   representing the whole universal Catholic Church and lawfully and
   reasonably called together." [276] It thought along the lines marked
   out by D'Ailly and Gerson and the other writers who had pronounced the
   unity of the Church to consist in oneness with her divine Head and
   declared that the Church, by virtue of the power residing in herself,
   has the right, in response to a divine call, to summon a council. The
   primitive Church had called synods, and James, not Peter, had presided
   at Jerusalem.

   D'Ailly, in making definite announcement of his views at a synod,
   meeting at Aix, Jan. 1, 1409, had said that the Church's unity depends
   upon the unity of her head, Christ. Christ's mystical body gets its
   authority from its divine head to meet in a general council through
   representatives, for it is written, "where two or three are gathered
   together in my name, there am I in the midst of them." The words are
   not "in Peter's name," or "in Paul's name," but "in my name." And when
   the faithful assemble to secure the welfare of the Church, there Christ
   is in their midst.

   Gerson wrote his most famous tract bearing on the schism and the
   Church's right to remove a pope--De auferibilitate papae ab ecclesia --
   while the council of Pisa was in session. [277] In this elaborate
   treatment he said that, in the strict sense, Christ is the Church's
   only bridegroom. The marriage between the pope and the Church may be
   dissolved, for such a spiritual marriage is not a sacrament. The pope
   may choose to separate himself from the Church and resign. The Church
   has a similar right to separate itself from the pope by removing him.
   All Church officers are appointed for the Church's welfare and, when
   the pope impedes its welfare, it may remove him. It is bound to defend
   itself. This it may do through a general council, meeting by general
   consent and without papal appointment. Such a council depends
   immediately upon Christ for its authority. The pope may be deposed for
   heresy or schism. He might be deposed even where he had no personal
   guilt, as in case he should be taken prisoner by the Saracens, and
   witnesses should testify he was dead. Another pope would then be chosen
   and, if the reports of the death of the former pope were proved false,
   and he be released from captivity, he or the other pope would have to
   be removed, for the Church cannot have more than one pontiff.

   Immediately after Easter, Charles Malatesta appeared in the council to
   advocate Gregory's cause. A commission, appointed by the cardinals,
   presented forty reasons to show that an agreement between the synod and
   the Roman pontiff was out of the question. Gregory must either appear
   at Pisa in person and abdicate, or present his resignation to a
   commission which the synod would appoint and send to Rimini.

   Gregory's case was also represented by the rival king of the Romans,
   Ruprecht, [278] through a special embassy made up of the archbishop of
   Riga, the bishops of Worms and Verden, and other commissioners. It
   presented twenty-four reasons for denying the council's jurisdiction.
   The paper was read by the bishop of Verden at the close of a sermon
   preached to the assembled councillors on the admirable text, "Peace be
   unto you." The most catching of the reasons was that, if the cardinals
   questioned the legitimacy of Gregory's pontificate, what ground had
   they for not questioning the validity of their own authority, appointed
   as they had been by Gregory or Benedict.

   In a document of thirty-eight articles, read April 24, the council
   presented detailed specifications against the two popes, charging them
   both with having made and broken solemn promises to resign.

   The argument was conducted by Peter de Anchorano, professor of both
   laws in Bologna, and by others. Peter argued that, by fostering the
   schism, Gregory and his rival had forfeited jurisdiction, and the duty
   of calling a representative council of Christendom devolved on the
   college of cardinals. In certain cases the cardinals are left no option
   whether they shall act or not, as when a pope is insane or falls into
   heresy or refuses to summon a council at a time when orthodox doctrine
   is at stake. The temporal power has the right to expel a pope who acts
   illegally.

   In an address on Hosea 1:11, "and the children of Judah and the
   children of Israel shall be gathered together and shall appoint
   themselves one head," Peter Plaoul, of the University of Paris, clearly
   placed the council above the pope, an opinion which had the support of
   his own university as well as the support of the universities of
   Toulouse, Angers, and Orleans. The learned canonist, Zabarella,
   afterwards appointed cardinal, took the same ground.

   The trial was carried on with all decorum and, at the end of two
   months, on June 5, sentence was pronounced, declaring both popes
   "notorious schismatics, promoters of schism, and notorious heretics,
   errant from the faith, and guilty of the notorious and enormous crimes
   of perjury and violated oaths." [279]

   Deputies arriving from Perpignan a week later, June 14, were hooted by
   the council when the archbishop of Tarragona, one of their number,
   declared them to be "the representatives of the venerable pope,
   Benedict XIII." Benedict had a short time before shown his defiance of
   the Pisan fathers by adding twelve members to his cabinet. When the
   deputies announced their intention of waiting upon Gregory, and asked
   for a letter of safe conduct, Balthazar Cossa, afterwards John XXIII.,
   the master of Bologna, is said to have declared, "Whether they come
   with a letter or without it, he would burn them all if he could lay his
   hands upon them."

   The rival popes being disposed of, it remained for the council to
   proceed to a new election, and it was agreed to leave the matter to the
   cardinals, who met in the archiepiscopal palace of Pisa, June 26, and
   chose the archbishop of Milan, Philargi, who took the name of Alexander
   V. He was about seventy, a member of the Franciscan order, and had
   received the red hat from Innocent VII. I. He was a Cretan by birth,
   and the first Greek to wear the tiara since John VII., in 706. He had
   never known his father or mother and, rescued from poverty by the
   Minorites, he was taken to Italy to be educated, and later sent to
   Oxford. After his election as pope, he is reported to have said, "as a
   bishop I was rich, as a cardinal poor, and as pope I am a beggar
   again." [280]

   In the meantime Gregory's side council at Cividale, near Aquileja, was
   running its course. There was scarcely an attendant at the first
   session. Later, Ruprecht and king Ladislaus were represented by
   deputies. The assumption of the body was out of all proportion to its
   size. It pronounced the pontiffs of the Roman line the legitimate
   rulers of Christendom, and appointed nuncios to all the kingdoms.
   However, not unmindful of his former professions, Gregory anew
   expressed his readiness to resign if his rivals, Peter of Luna and
   Peter of Candia (Crete), would do the same. Venice had declared for
   Alexander, and Gregory, obliged to flee in the disguise of a merchant,
   found refuge in the ships of Ladislaus.

   Benedict's council met in Perpignan six months before, November, 1408.
   One hundred and twenty prelates were in attendance, most of them from
   Spain. The council adjourned March 26, 1409, after appointing a
   delegation of seven to proceed to Pisa and negotiate for the healing of
   the schism.

   After Alexander's election, the members lost interest in the synod and
   began to withdraw from Pisa, and it was found impossible to keep the
   promise made by the cardinals that there should be no adjournment till
   measures had been taken to reform the Church "in head and members."
   Commissions were appointed to consider reforms, and Alexander prorogued
   the body, Aug. 7, 1409, after appointing another council for April 12,
   1412. [281]

   At the opening of the Pisan synod there were two popes; at its close,
   three. Scotland and Spain still held to Benedict, and Naples and parts
   of Central Europe continued to acknowledge the obedience of Gregory.
   The greater part of Christendom, however, was bound to the support of
   Alexander. This pontiff lacked the strength needed for the emergency,
   and he aroused the opposition of the University of Paris by extending
   the rights of the Mendicant orders to hear confessions. [282] He died
   at Bologna, May 3, 1410, without having entered the papal city. Rumor
   went that Balthazar Cossa, who was about to be elected his successor,
   had poison administered to him.

   As a rule, modern Catholic historians are inclined to belittle the
   Pisan synod, and there is an almost general agreement among them that
   it lacked oecumenical character. Without pronouncing a final decision
   on the question, Bellarmin regarded Alexander V. as legitimate pope.
   Gerson and other great contemporaries treated it as oecumenical, as did
   also Bossuet and other Gallican historians two centuries later. Modern
   Catholic historians treat the claims of Gregory XII. as not affected by
   a council which was itself illegitimate and a high-handed revolt
   against canon law. [283]

   But whether the name oecumenical be given or be withheld matters
   little, in view of the general judgment which the summons and sitting
   of the council call forth. It was a desperate measure adopted to suit
   an emergency, but it was also the product of a new freedom of
   ecclesiastical thought, and so far a good omen of a better age. The
   Pisan synod demonstrated that the Church remained virtually a unit in
   spite of the double pontifical administration. It branded by their
   right names the specious manoevres of Gregory and Peter de Luna. It
   brought together the foremost thinkers and literary interests of Europe
   and furnished a platform of free discussion. Not its least service was
   in preparing the way for the imposing council which convened in
   Constance five years later.

   § 16. The Council of Constance. 1414-1418.

   At Alexander's death, seventeen cardinals met in Bologna and elected
   Balthazar Cossa, who took the name of John XXIII. He was of noble
   Neapolitan lineage, began his career as a soldier and perhaps as a
   corsair, [284] was graduated in both laws at Bologna and was made
   cardinal by Boniface IX. He joined in the call of the council of Pisa.
   A man of ability, he was destitute of every moral virtue, and capable
   of every vice.

   Leaning for support upon Louis of Anjou, John gained entrance to Rome.
   In the battle of Rocca Secca, May 14, 1411, Louis defeated the troops
   of Ladislaus. The captured battle-flags were sent to Rome, hung up in
   St. Peter's, then torn down in the sight of the people, and dragged in
   the dust in the triumphant procession through the streets of the city,
   in which John participated. Ladislaus speedily recovered from his
   defeat, and John, with his usual faithlessness, made terms with
   Ladislaus, recognizing him as king, while Ladislaus, on his part,
   renounced his allegiance to Gregory XII. That pontiff was ordered to
   quit Neapolitan territory, and embarking in Venetian vessels at Gaeta,
   fled to Dalmatia, and finally took refuge with Charles Malatesta of
   Rimini, his last political ally.

   The Council of Constance, the second of the Reformatory councils, was
   called together by the joint act of Pope John XXIII. and Sigismund,
   king of the Romans. It was not till he was reminded by the University
   of Paris that John paid heed to the action of the Council of Pisa and
   called a council to meet at Rome, April, 1412. Its sessions were
   scantily attended, and scarcely a trace of it is left. [285] After
   ordering Wyclif's writings burnt, it adjourned Feb. 10, 1413. John had
   strengthened the college of cardinals by adding fourteen to its number,
   among them men of the first rank, as D'Ailly, Zabarella of Florence,
   Robert Hallum, bishop of Salisbury, and Fillastre, dean of Rheims.

   Ladislaus, weary of his treaty with John and ambitious to create a
   unified Latin kingdom, took Rome, 1413, giving the city over to sack.
   The king rode into the Lateran and looked down from his horse on the
   heads of St. Peter and St. Paul, which he ordered the canons to
   display. The very churches were robbed, and soldiers and their
   courtesans drank wine out of the sacred chalices. Ladislaus left Rome,
   struck with a vicious disease, rumored to be due to poison administered
   by an apothecary's daughter of Perugia, and died at Naples, August,
   1414. He had been one of the most prominent figures in Europe for a
   quarter of a century and the chief supporter of the Roman line of
   pontiffs.

   Driven from Rome, John was thrown into the hands of Sigismund, who was
   then in Lombardy. This prince, the grandson of the blind king, John,
   who was killed at Crécy, had come to the throne of Hungary through
   marriage with its heiress. At Ruprecht's death he was elected king of
   the Romans, 1411. Circumstances and his own energy made him the most
   prominent sovereign of his age and the chief political figure in the
   Council of Constance. He lacked high aims and moral purpose, but had
   some taste for books, and spoke several languages besides his own
   native German. Many sovereigns have placed themselves above national
   statutes, but Sigismund went farther and, according to the story,
   placed himself above the rules of grammar. In his first address at the
   Council of Constance, so it is said, he treated the Latin word schisma,
   schism, as if it were feminine. [286] When Priscian and other learned
   grammarians were quoted to him to show it was neuter, he replied, "Yes;
   but I am emperor and above them, and can make a new grammar." The fact
   that Sigismund was not yet emperor when the mistake is said to have
   been made--for he was not crowned till 1433--seems to prejudice the
   authenticity of the story, but it is quite likely that he made mistakes
   in Latin and that the bon-mot was humorously invented with reference to
   it.

   Pressed by the growing troubles in Bohemia over John Huss, Sigismund
   easily became an active participant in the measures looking towards a
   new council. Men distrusted John XXIII. The only hope of healing the
   schism seemed to rest with the future emperor. In many documents, and
   by John himself, he was addressed as "advocate and defender of the
   Church" [287] -- advocatus et defensor ecclesiae. [288]

   Two of John's cardinals met Sigismund at Como, Oct. 13, 1413, and
   discussed the time and place of the new synod. John preferred an
   Italian city, Sigismund the small Swabian town of Kempten; Strassburg,
   Basel, and other places were mentioned, but Constance, on German
   territory, was at last fixed upon. On Oct. 30 Sigismund announced the
   approaching council to all the prelates, princes, and doctors of
   Christendom, and on Dec. 9 John attached his seal to the call.
   Sigismund and John met at Lodi the last of November, 1413, and again at
   Cremona early in January, 1414, the pope being accompanied by thirteen
   cardinals. Thus the two great luminaries of this mundane sphere were
   again side by side. [289] They ascended together the great Torazzo,
   close to the cathedral of Cremona, accompanied by the lord of the town,
   who afterwards regretted that he had not seized his opportunity and
   pitched them both down to the street. Not till the following August was
   a formal announcement of the impending council sent to the Kaufhaus

   Gregory XII., who recognized Sigismund as king of the Romans. [290]
   Gregory complained to Archbishop Andrew of Spalato, bearer of the
   notice, of the lateness of the invitation, and that he had not been
   consulted in regard to the council. Sigismund promised that, if Gregory
   should be deposed, he would see to it that he received a good life
   position. [291]

   The council, which was appointed for Nov. 1, 1414, lasted nearly four
   years, and proved to be one of the most imposing gatherings which has
   ever convened in Western Europe. It was a veritable parliament of
   nations, a convention of the leading intellects of the age, who pressed
   together to give vent to the spirit of free discussion which the
   Avignon scandals and the schism had developed, and to debate the most
   urgent of questions, the reunion of Christendom under one undisputed
   head." [292]

   Following the advice of his cardinals, John, who set his face
   reluctantly towards the North, reached Constance Oct. 28, 1414. The
   city then contained 5500 people, and the beauty of its location, its
   fields, and its vineyards, were praised by Nieheim and other
   contemporaries. They also spoke of the salubriousness of the air and
   the justice of the municipal laws for strangers. It seemed to be as a
   field which the Lord had blessed. [293] As John approached Constance,
   coming by way of the Tirol, he is said to have exclaimed, "Ha, this is
   the place where foxes are trapped." He entered the town in great style,
   accompanied by nine cardinals and sixteen hundred mounted horsemen. He
   rode a white horse, its back covered with a red rug. Its bridles were
   held by the count of Montferrat and an Orsini of Rome. The city council
   sent to the pope's lodgings four large barrels of Elsass wine, eight of
   native wine, and other wines. [294]

   The first day of November, John attended a solemn mass at the
   cathedral. The council met on the 5th, with fifteen cardinals present.
   The first public session was held Nov. 16. In all, forty-five public
   sessions were held, the usual hour of assembling being 7 in the
   morning. Gregory XII. was represented by two delegates, the titular
   patriarch of Constantinople and Cardinal John Dominici of Ragusa, a man
   of great sagacity and excellent spirit.

   The convention did not get into full swing until the arrival of
   Sigismund on Christmas Eve, fresh from his coronation, which occurred
   at Aachen, Nov. 8, and accompanied by his queen, Barbara, and a
   brilliant suite. After warming themselves, the imperial party proceeded
   to the cathedral and, at cock-crowing Christmas morning, were received
   by the pope. Services were held lasting eight, or, according to another
   authority, eleven hours without interruption. Sigismund, wearing his
   crown and a dalmatic, exercised the functions of deacon and read the
   Gospel, and the pope conferred upon him a sword, bidding him use it to
   protect the Church.

   Constance had become the most conspicuous locality in Europe. It
   attracted people of every rank, from the king to the beggar. A scene of
   the kind on so great a scale had never been witnessed in the West
   before. The reports of the number of strangers in the city vary from
   50,000 to 100,000. Richental, the indefatigable Boswell of the council,
   himself a resident of Constance, gives an account of the arrival of
   every important personage, together with the number of his retainers.
   One-half of his Chronicle is a directory of names. He went from house
   to house, taking a census, and to the thousands he mentions by name, he
   adds 5000 who rode in and out of the town every day. He states that
   80,000 witnessed the coronation of Martin V. The lodgings of the more
   distinguished personages were marked with their coats of arms. Bakers,
   beadles, grooms, scribes, goldsmiths, merchantmen of every sort, even
   to traffickers from the Orient, flocked together to serve the dukes and
   prelates and the learned university masters and doctors. There were in
   attendance on the council, 33 cardinals, 5 patriarchs, 47 archbishops,
   145 bishops, 93 titular bishops, 217 doctors of theology, 361 doctors
   in both laws, 171 doctors of medicine, besides a great number of
   masters of arts from the 37 universities represented, 83 kings and
   princes represented by envoys, 38 dukes, 173 counts, 71 barons, more
   than 1500 knights, 142 writers of bulls, 1700 buglers, fiddlers, and
   players on other musical instruments. Seven hundred women of the street
   practised their trade openly or in rented houses, while the number of
   those who practised it secretly was a matter of conjecture. [295] There
   were 36,000 beds for strangers. Five hundred are said to have been
   drowned in the lake during the progress of the council. Huss wrote,
   "This council is a scene of foulness, for it is a common saying among
   the Swiss that a generation will not suffice to cleanse Constance from
   the sins which the council has committed in this city." [296]

   The English and Scotch delegation, which numbered less than a dozen
   persons, was accompanied by 700 or 800 mounted men, splendidly
   accoutred, and headed by fifers and other musicians, and made a great
   sensation by their entry into the city. The French delegation was
   marked by its university men and other men of learning. [297]

   The streets and surroundings presented the spectacle of a merry fair.
   There were tournaments, dances, acrobatic shows, processions, musical
   displays. But in spite of the congestion, good order seems to have been
   maintained. By order of the city council, persons were forbidden to be
   out after curfew without a light. Chains were to be stretched across
   some of the streets, and all shouting at night was forbidden. It is
   said that during the council's progress only two persons were punished
   for street brawls. A check was put upon extortionate rates by a strict
   tariff. The price of a white loaf was fixed at a penny, and a bed for
   two persons, with sheets and pillows, at a gulden and a half a month,
   the linen to be washed every two weeks. Fixed prices were put upon
   grains, meat, eggs, birds, and other articles of food. [298] The
   bankers present were a great number, among them the young Cosimo de'
   Medici of Florence.

   Among the notables in attendance, the pope and Sigismund occupied the
   chief place. The most inordinate praise was heaped upon the king. He
   was compared to Daniel, who rescued Susanna, and to David. He was fond
   of pleasure, very popular with women, always in debt and calling for
   money, but a deadly foe of heretics, so that whenever he roared, it was
   said, the Wyclifites fled. [299] There can be no doubt that to
   Sigismund were due the continuance and success of the council. His
   queen, Barbara, the daughter of a Styrian count, was tall and fair, but
   of questionable reputation, and her gallantries became the talk of the
   town.

   The next most eminent persons were Cardinals D'Ailly, Zabarella,
   Fillastre, John of Ragusa, and Hallum, bishop of Salisbury, who died
   during the session of the council, and was buried in Constance, the
   bishop of Winchester, uncle to the English king, and John Gerson, the
   chief representative of the University of Paris. Zabarella was the most
   profound authority on civil and canon law in Europe, a professor at
   Bologna, and in 1410 made bishop of Florence. He died in the midst of
   the council's proceedings, Sept. 26, 1417. Fillastre left behind him a
   valuable daily journal of the council's proceedings. D'Ailly had been
   for some time one of the most prominent figures in Europe. Hallum is
   frequently mentioned in the proceedings of the council. Among the most
   powerful agencies at work in the assemblies were the tracts thrown off
   at the time, especially those of Diedrich of Nieheim, one of the most
   influential pamphleteers of the later Middle Ages. [300]

   The subjects which the council was called together to discuss were the
   reunion of the Church under one pope, and Church reforms. [301] The
   action against heresy, including the condemnation of John Huss and
   Jerome of Prag, is also conspicuous among the proceedings of the
   council, though not treated by contemporaries as a distinct subject.
   From the start, John lost support. A sensation was made by a tract, the
   work of an Italian, describing John's vices both as man and pope. John
   of Ragusa and Fillastre recommended the resignation of all three papal
   claimants, and this idea became more and more popular, and was, after
   some delay, adopted by Sigismund, and was trenchantly advocated by
   Nieheim, in his tract on the Necessity of a Reformation in the Church.

   From the very beginning great plainness of speech was used, so that
   John had good reason to be concerned for the tenure of his office.
   December 7, 1414, the cardinals passed propositions binding him to a
   faithful performance of his papal duties and abstinence from simony.
   D'Ailly wrote against the infallibility of councils, and thus furnished
   the ground for setting aside the papal election at Pisa.

   From November to January, 1415, a general disposition was manifested to
   avoid taking the initiative--the noli me tangere policy, as it was
   called. [302] The ferment of thought and discussion became more and
   more active, until the first notable principle was laid down early in
   February, 1415, namely, the rule requiring the vote to be by nations.
   The purpose was to overcome the vote of the eighty Italian bishops and
   doctors who were committed to John's cause. The action was taken in the
   face of John's opposition, and followed the precedent set by the
   University of Paris in the government of its affairs. By this rule,
   which no council before or since has followed, except the little
   Council of Siena, 1423, England, France, Italy, and Germany had each a
   single vote in the affairs of the council. In 1417, when Aragon,
   Castile, and Scotland gave in their submission to the council, a fifth
   vote was accorded to Spain. England had the smallest representation. In
   the German nation were included Scandinavia, Poland, and Hungary. The
   request of the cardinals to have accorded to them a distinct vote as a
   body was denied. They met with the several nations to which they
   belonged, and were limited to the same rights enjoyed by other
   individuals. This rule seems to have been pressed from the first with
   great energy by the English, led by Robert of Salisbury. Strange to
   say, there is no record that this mode of voting was adopted by any
   formal conciliar decree. [303]

   The nations met each under its own president in separate places, the
   English and Germans sitting in different rooms in the convent of the
   Grey Friars. The vote of the majority of the nations carried in the
   public sessions of the council. The right to vote in the nations was
   extended so as to include the doctors of both kinds and princes.
   D'Ailly advocated this course, and Fillastre argued in favor of
   including rectors and even clergymen of the lowest rank. Why, reasoned
   D'Ailly, should a titular bishop have an equal voice with a bishop
   ruling over an extensive see, say the archbishopric of Mainz, and why
   should a doctor be denied all right to vote who has given up his time
   and thought to the questions under discussion? And why, argued
   Fillastre, should an abbot, having control over only ten monks, have a
   vote, when a rector with a care of a thousand or ten thousand souls is
   excluded? An ignorant king or prelate he called a "crowned ass."
   Doctors were on hand for the very purpose of clearing up ignorance.

   When the Italian tract appeared, which teemed with charges against
   John, matters were brought to a crisis. Then it became evident that the
   scheme calling for the removal of all three popes would go through, and
   John, to avoid a worse fate, agreed to resign, making the condition
   that Gregory XII. and Benedict should also resign. The formal
   announcement, which was read at the second session, March 2, 1415, ran:
   "I, John XXIII., pope, promise, agree, and obligate myself, vow and
   swear before God, the Church, and this holy council, of my own free
   will and spontaneously, to give peace to the Church by abdication,
   provided the pretenders, Benedict and Gregory, do the same." [304] At
   the words "vow and swear," John rose from his seat and knelt down at
   the altar, remaining on his knees till he finished the reading. The
   reading being over, Sigismund removed his crown, bent before John, and
   kissed his feet. Five days after, John issued a bull confirming his
   oath.

   Constance was wild with joy. The bells rang out the glad news. In the
   cathedral, joy expressed itself in tears. The spontaneity of John's
   self-deposition may be questioned, in view of the feeling which
   prevailed among the councillors and the report that he had made an
   offer to cede the papacy for 30,000 gulden. [305]

   A most annoying, though ridiculous, turn was now given to affairs by
   John's flight from Constance, March 20. Rumors had been whispered about
   that he was contemplating such a move. He talked of transferring the
   council to Rizza, and complained of the unhealthiness of the air of
   Constance. He, however, made the solemn declaration that he would not
   leave the town before the dissolution of the council. To be on the safe
   side, Sigismund gave orders for the gates to be kept closed and the
   lake watched. But John had practised dark arts before, and, unmindful
   of his oath, escaped at high noon on a "little horse," in the disguise
   of a groom, wrapped in a gray cloak, wearing a gray cap, and having a
   crossbow tied to his saddle. [306] The flight was made while the gay
   festivities of a tournament, instituted by Frederick, duke of Austria,
   were going on, and with two attendants. The pope continued his course
   without rest till he reached Schaffhausen. This place belonged to the
   duke, who was in the secret, and on whom John had conferred the office
   of commander of the papal troops, with a yearly grant of 6000 gulden.
   John's act was an act of desperation. He wrote back to the council,
   giving as the reason of his flight that he had been in fear of
   Sigismund, and that his freedom of action had been restricted by the
   king. [307]

   So great was the panic produced by the pope's flight that the council
   would probably have been brought to a sudden close by a general
   scattering of its members, had it not been for Sigismund's prompt
   action. Cardinals and envoys despatched by the king and council made
   haste to stop the fleeing pope, who continued on to Laufenburg,
   Freiburg, and Breisach. John wrote to Sigismund, expressing his regard
   for him, but with the same pen he was addressing communications to the
   University of Paris and the duke of Orleans, seeking to awaken sympathy
   for his cause by playing upon the national feelings of the French. He
   attempted to make it appear that the French delegation had been
   disparaged when the council proceeded to business before the arrival of
   the twenty-two deputies of the University. France and Italy, with two
   hundred prelates, had each only a single vote, while England, with only
   three prelates, had a vote. God, he affirmed, dealt with individuals
   and not with nations. He also raised the objection that married laymen
   had votes at the side of prelates, and John Huss had not been put on
   trial, though he had been condemned by the University of Paris.

   To the envoys who found John at Breisach, April 23, he gave his promise
   to return with them to Constance the next morning; but with his usual
   duplicity, he attempted to escape during the night, and was let down
   from the castle by a ladder, disguised as a peasant. He was soon
   seized, and ultimately handed over by Sigismund to Louis III., of the
   Palatinate, for safe-keeping.

   In the meantime the council forbade any of the delegates to leave
   Constance before the end of the proceedings, on pain of excommunication
   and the loss of dignities. Its fourth and fifth sessions, beginning
   April 6, 1415, mark an epoch in the history of ecclesiastical
   statement. The council declared that, being assembled legitimately in
   the Holy Spirit, it was an oecumenical council and representing the
   whole Church, had its authority immediately from Christ, and that to it
   the pope and persons of every grade owed obedience in things pertaining
   to the faith and to the reformation of the Church in head and members.
   It was superior to all other ecclesiastical tribunals. [308] This
   declaration, stated with more precision than the one of Pisa, meant a
   vast departure from the papal theory of Innocent III. and Boniface
   VIII.

   Gerson, urging this position in his sermon before the council, March
   23, 1415, said [309] the gates of hell had prevailed against popes, but
   not against the Church. Joseph was set to guard his master's wife, not
   to debauch her, and when the pope turned aside from his duty, the
   Church had authority to punish him. A council has the right by reason
   of the vivifying power of the Holy Spirit to prolong itself, and may,
   under certain conditions, assemble without call of pope or his consent.

   The conciliar declarations reaffirmed the principle laid down by
   Nieheim on the eve of the council in the tract entitled the Union of
   the Church and its Reformation, and by other writers. [310] The Church,
   Nieheim affirmed, whose head is Christ, cannot err, but the Church as a
   commonwealth,--respublica,--controlled by pope and hierarchy, may err.
   And as a prince who does not seek the good of his subjects may be
   deposed, so may the pope, who is called to preside over the whole
   Church .... The pope is born of man, born in sin--clay of clay--limus
   de limo. A few days ago the son of a rustic, and now raised to the
   papal throne, he is not become an impeccable angel. It is not his
   office that makes him holy, but the grace of God. He is not infallible;
   and as Christ, who was without sin, was subject to a tribunal, 80 is
   the pope. It is absurd to say that a mere man has power in heaven and
   on earth to bind and loose from sin. For he may be a simoniac, a liar,
   a fornicator, proud, and worse than the devil--pejor quam diabolus. As
   for a council, the pope is under obligation to submit to it and, if
   necessary, to resign for the common good--utilitatem communem. A
   general council may be called by the prelates and temporal rulers, and
   is superior to the pope. It may elect, limit, and depose a pope--and
   from its decision there is no appeal--potest papam eligere, privare et
   deponere. A tali concilio nullus potest appellare.Its canons are
   immutable, except as they may be set aside by another oecumenical
   council.

   These views were revolutionary, and show that Marsiglius of Padua, and
   other tractarians of the fourteenth century, had not spoken in vain.

   Having affirmed its superiority over the pope, the council proceeded to
   try John XXIII. on seventy charges, which included almost every crime
   known to man. He had been unchaste from his youth, had been given to
   lying, was disobedient to his parents. He was guilty of simony, bought
   his way to the cardinalate, sold the same benefices over and over
   again, sold them to children, disposed of the head of John the Baptist,
   belonging to the nuns of St. Sylvester, Rome, to Florence, for 50,000
   ducats, made merchandise of spurious bulls, committed adultery with his
   brother's wife, violated nuns and other virgins, was guilty of sodomy
   and other nameless vices. [311] As for doctrine, he had often denied
   the future life.

   When John received the notice of his deposition, which was pronounced
   May 29, 1415, he removed the papal cross from his room and declared he
   regretted ever having been elected pope. He was taken to Gottlieben, a
   castle belonging to the bishop of Constance, and then removed to the
   castle at Heidelberg, where two chaplains and two nobles were assigned
   to serve him. From Heidelberg the count Palatine transferred him to
   Mannheim, and finally released him on the payment of 30,000 gulden.
   John submitted to his successor, Martin V., and in 1419 was appointed
   cardinal bishop of Tusculum, but survived the appointment only six
   months. John's accomplice, Frederick of Austria, was deprived of his
   lands, and was known as Frederick of the empty purse--Friedrich mit der
   leeren Tasche. A splendid monument was erected to John in the
   baptistery in Florence by Cosimo de' Medici, who had managed the pope's
   money affairs.

   While John's case was being decided, the trial of John Huss was under
   way. The proceedings and the tragedy of Huss' death are related in
   another place.

   John XXIII. was out of the way. Two popes remained, Gregory XII. and
   Benedict XIII., who were facetiously called in tracts and addresses
   Errorius, a play on Gregory's patronymic, Angelo Correr, [312] and
   Maledictus. Gregory promptly resigned, thus respecting his promise made
   to the council to resign, provided John and Benedict should be set
   aside. He also had promised to recognize the council, provided the
   emperor should preside. The resignation was announced at the fourteenth
   session, July 4, 1415, by Charles Malatesta and John of Ragusa,
   representing the Roman pontiff. Gregory's bull, dated May 15, 1414,
   which was publicly read, "convoked and authorized the general council
   so far as Balthazar Cossa, John XXIII., is not present and does not
   preside." The words of resignation ran, "I resign, in the name of the
   Lord, the papacy, and all its rights and title and all the privileges
   conferred upon it by the Lord Jesus Christ in this sacred synod and
   universal council representing the holy Roman and universal Church."
   [313] Gregory's cardinals now took their seats, and Gregory himself was
   appointed cardinal-bishop of Porto and papal legate of Ancona. He died
   at Recanati, near Ancona, Oct. 18, 1417. Much condemnation as Angelo
   Correr deserves for having temporized about renouncing the papacy,
   posterity has not withheld from him respect for his honorable dealing
   at the close of his career. The high standing of his cardinal, John of
   Ragusa, did much to make men forget Gregory's faults.

   Peter de Luna was of a different mind. Every effort was made to bring
   him into accord with the mind of the councilmen in the Swiss city, but
   in vain. In order to bring all the influence possible to bear upon him,
   Sigismund, at the council's instance, started on the journey to see the
   last of the Avignon popes face to face. The council, at its sixteenth
   session, July 11, 1415, appointed doctors to accompany the king, and
   eight days afterwards he broke away from Constance, accompanied by a
   troop of 4000 men on horse.

   Sigismund and Benedict met at Narbonne, Aug. 15, and at Perpignan, the
   negotiations lasting till December. The decree of deposition pronounced
   at Pisa, and France's withdrawal of allegiance, had not broken the
   spirit of the old man. His dogged tenacity was worthy of a better
   cause. [314] Among the propositions the pope had the temerity to make
   was that he would resign provided that he, as the only surviving
   cardinal from the times before the schism, should have liberty to
   follow his abdication by himself electing the new pontiff. Who knows
   but that one who was 80 thoroughly assured of his own infallibility
   would have chosen himself. Benedict persisted in calling the Council of
   Constance the "congregation," or assembly. On Nov. 14 he fled to
   Peñiscola, a rocky promontory near Valencia, again condemned the Swiss
   synod, and summoned a legitimate one to meet in his isolated Spanish
   retreat. His own cardinals were weary of the conflict, and Dec. 13,
   1415, declared him deposed. His long-time supporter, Vincent Ferrer,
   called him a perjurer. The following month the kingdom of Aragon, which
   had been Benedict's chief support, withdrew from his obedience and was
   followed by Castile and Scotland.

   Peter de Luna was now as thoroughly isolated as any mortal could well
   be. The council demanded his unconditional abdication, and was
   strengthened by the admission of his old supporters, the Spanish
   delegates. At the thirty-seventh session, 1417, he was deposed. By
   Sigismund's command the decision was announced on the streets of
   Constance by trumpeters. But the indomitable Spaniard continued to defy
   the synod's sentence till his death, nine years later, and from the
   lonely citadel of Peñiscola to sit as sovereign of Christendom.
   Cardinal Hergenröther concludes his description of these events by
   saying that Benedict "was a pope without a church and a shepherd
   without sheep. This very fact proves the emptiness of his claims."
   Benedict died, 1423, [315] leaving behind him four cardinals. Three of
   these elected the canon, Gil Sauduz de Munoz of Barcelona, who took the
   name of Clement VIII. Five years later Gil resigned, and was appointed
   by Martin V. bishop of Majorca, on which island he was a pope with
   insular jurisdiction. [316] The fourth cardinal, Jean Carrier, elected
   himself pope, and took the name of Benedict XIV. He died in prison,
   1433.

   It remained for the council to terminate the schism of years by
   electing a new pontiff and to proceed to the discussions of Church
   reforms. At the fortieth session, Oct. 30, 1417, it was decided to
   postpone the second item until after the election of the new pope. In
   fixing this order of business, the cardinals had a large influence.
   There was a time in the history of the council when they were
   disparaged. Tracts were written against them, and the king at one time,
   so it was rumored, proposed to seize them all. [317] But that time was
   past; they had kept united, and their influence had steadily grown.

   The papal vacancy was filled, Nov. 11, 1417, by the election of
   Cardinal Oddo Colonna, who took the name of Martin V. The election was
   consummated in the Kaufhaus, the central commercial building of
   Constance, which is still standing. Fifty-three electors participated,
   6 deputies from each of the 5 nations, and 23 cardinals. The building
   was walled up with boards and divided into cells for the electors.
   Entrance was had by a single door, and the three keys were given, one
   to the king, one to the chapter of Constance, and one to the council.
   When it became apparent that an election was likely to be greatly
   delayed, the Germans determined to join the Italians in voting for an
   Italian to avoid suspicion that advantage was taken of the synod's
   location on German soil. The Germans then secured the co-operation of
   the English, and finally the French and Spaniards also yielded. [318]
   The pope-elect was thus the creature of the council.

   The Western Church was again unified under one head. But for the
   deep-seated conviction of centuries, the office of the universal papacy
   would scarcely have survived the strain of the schism. [319] Oddo
   Colonna, the only member of his distinguished house who has worn the
   tiara, was a subdeacon at the time of his election. Even more hastily
   than Photius, patriarch of Constantinople, was he rushed through the
   ordination of deacon, Nov. 12, of priest, Nov. 13, and bishop, Nov. 14.
   He was consecrated pope a week later, Nov. 21, Sigismund kissing his
   toe. In the procession, the bridles of Martin's horse were held by
   Sigismund and Frederick the Hohenzollern, lately created margrave of
   Brandenburg. The margrave had paid Sigismund 250,000 marks as the price
   of his elevation, a sum which the king used to defray the expenses of
   his visit to Benedict.

   Martin at once assumed the presidency of the council which since John's
   flight had been filled by Cardinal Viviers. Measures of reform were now
   the order of the day and some headway was made. The papal right of
   granting indulgences was curtailed. The college of cardinals was
   limited to 24, with the stipulation that the different parts of the
   church should have a proportionate representation, that no monastic
   order should have more than a single member in the college, and that no
   cardinal's brother or nephew should be raised to the curia so long as
   the cardinal was living. Schedules and programmes enough were made, but
   the question of reform involved abuses of such long standing and so
   deeply intrenched that it was found impossible to reconcile the
   differences of opinion prevailing in the council and bring it to
   promptness of action. After sitting for more than three years, the
   delegates were impatient to get away.

   As a substitute for further legislation, the so-called concordats were
   arranged. These agreements were intended to regulate the relations of
   the papacy and the nations one with the other. There were four of these
   distinct compacts, one with the French, and one with the German
   nations, each to be valid for five years, one with the English to be
   perpetual, dated July 21, 1418, and one with the Spanish nation, dated
   May 13, 1418. [320] These concordats set forth rules for the
   appointment of the cardinals and the restriction of their number,
   limited the right of papal reservations and the collection of annates
   and direct taxes, determined what causes might be appealed to Rome, and
   took up other questions. They were the foundation of the system of
   secret or open treaties by which the papacy has since regulated its
   relations with the nations of Europe. Gregory VII. was the first pope
   to extend the system of papal legates, but he and his successors had
   dealt with nations on the arbitrary principle of papal supremacy and
   infallibility.

   The action of the Council of Constance lifted the state to some measure
   of equality with the papacy in the administration of Church affairs. It
   remained for Louis XIV., 16431715, to assert more fully the Gallican
   theory of the authority of the state to manage the affairs of the
   Church within its territory, so far as matters of doctrine were not
   touched. The first decisive step in the assertion of Gallican liberties
   was the synodal action of 1407, when France withdrew from the obedience
   of Benedict XIII. By this action the chapters were to elect their own
   bishops, and the pope was restrained from levying taxes on their sees.
   Then followed the compact of the Council of Constance, the Pragmatic
   Sanction adopted at Bourges, 1438, and the concordat agreed upon
   between Francis I. and Leo X. at the time of the Reformation. In 1682
   the French prelates adopted four propositions, restricting the pope's
   authority to spirituals, a power which is limited by the decision of
   the Council of Constance, and by the precedents of the Gallican Church,
   and declaring that even in matters of faith the pope is not infallible.
   Although Louis, who gave his authority to these articles, afterwards
   revoked them, they remain a platform of Gallicanism as against the
   ultramontane theory of the infallibility and supreme authority of the
   pope, and may furnish in the future the basis of a settlement of the
   papal question in the Catholic communion. [321]

   In the deliverance known as Frequens, passed Oct. 9, 1417, the council
   decreed that a general council should meet in five years, then in seven
   years, and thereafter perpetually every ten years. [322] This action
   was prompted by Martin in the bull Frequens, Oct. 9, 1417. On
   completing its forty-fifth session it was adjourned by Martin, April
   22, 1418. The Basel-Ferrara and the Tridentine councils sat a longer
   time, as did also the Protestant Westminster Assembly, 1643-1648.
   Before breaking away from Constance, the pope granted Sigismund a tenth
   for one year to reimburse him for the expense he had been to on account
   of the synod.

   The Council of Constance was the most important synod of the Middle
   Ages, and more fairly represented the sentiments of Western Christendom
   than any other council which has ever sat. It furnished an arena of
   free debate upon interests whose importance was felt by all the nations
   of Western Europe, and which united them. It was not restricted by a
   programme prepared by a pope, as the Vatican council of 1870 was. It
   had freedom and exercised it. While the dogma of transubstantiation
   enacted by the 4th Lateran, 1215, and the dogma of papal infallibility
   passed by the Vatican council injected elements of permanent division
   into the Church, the Council of Constance unified Latin Christendom and
   ended the schism which had been a cause of scandal for forty years. The
   validity of its decree putting an oecumenical council above the pope,
   after being disputed for centuries, was officially set aside by the
   conciliar vote of 1870. For Protestants the decision at Constance is an
   onward step towards a right definition of the final seat of religious
   authority. It remained for Luther, forced to the wall by Eck at
   Leipzig, and on the ground of the error committed by the Council of
   Constance, in condemning the godly man, John Huss, to deny the
   infallibility of councils and to place the seat of infallible authority
   in the Scriptures, as interpreted by conscience.

   Note on the Oecumenical Character of the Council of Constance.

   Modern Roman Catholic historians deny the oecumenical character and
   authority of the Council of Constance, except its four last, 42d-45th
   sessions, which were presided over by Pope Martin V., or at least all
   of it till the moment of Gregory XII.'s bull giving to the council his
   approval, that is, after John had fled and ceased to preside.
   Hergenröther-Kirsch, II. 862, says that before Gregory's authorization
   the council was without a head, did not represent the Roman Church, and
   sat against the will of the cardinals, by whom he meant Gregory's
   cardinals. Salembier, p. 317, says, Il n'est devenu oecuménique
   qu'après la trente-cinquième session, lorsque Grégoire III. eut donné
   sa démission, etc. Pastor, I. 198 sq., warmly advocates the same view,
   and declares that when the council in its 4th and 6th sessions
   announced its superiority over the pope, it was not yet an oecumenical
   gathering. This dogma, he says, was intended to set up a new principle
   which revolutionized the old Catholic doctrine of the Church. Philip
   Hergenröther, in Katholisches Kirchenrecht, p. 344 sq., expresses the
   same judgment. The council was not a legitimate council till after
   Gregory's resignation.

   The wisdom of the council in securing the resignation of Gregory and
   deposing John and Benedict is not questioned. The validity of its act
   in electing Martin V., though the papal regulation limiting the right
   of voting to the cardinals was set aside, is also acknowledged on the
   ground that the council at the time of Martin's election was sitting by
   Gregory's sanction, and Gregory was true pope until he abdicated.

   A serious objection to the view, setting aside this action of the 4th
   and 5th sessions, is offered by the formal statement made by Martin V.
   At the final meeting of the council and after its adjournment had been
   pronounced, a tumultuous discussion was precipitated over the tract
   concerning the affairs of Poland and Lithuania by the Dominican,
   Falkenberg, which was written in defence of the Teutonic Knights, and
   justified the killing of the Polish king and all his subjects. It had
   been the subject of discussion in the nations, and its heresies were
   declared to be so glaring that, if they remained uncondemned by the
   council, that body would go down to posterity as defective in its
   testimony for orthodoxy. It was during the tumultuous debate, and after
   Martin had adjourned the council, that he uttered the words which, on
   their face, sanction whatever was done in council in a conciliar way.
   Putting an end to the tumult, he announced he would maintain all the
   decrees passed by the council in matters of faith in a conciliar
   way--omnia et singula determinata et conclusa et decreta in materiis
   fidei per praesens sacrum concilium generale Constantiense
   conciliariter tenere et inviolabiliter observare volebat et nunquam
   contravenire quoquomodo. Moreover, he announced that he sanctioned and
   ratified acts made in a "conciliar way and not made otherwise or in any
   other way." Ipsaque sic conciliariter facta approbat papa et ratificat
   et non aliter nec alio modo. Funk, Martin V. und das Konzil zu Konstanz
   in Abhandlungen, I. 489 sqq., Hefele, Conciliengesch., I. 62, and
   Küpper, in Wetzer-Welte, VII. 1004 sqq., restrict the application of
   these words to the Falkenberg incident. Funk, however, by a narrow
   interpretation of the words "in matter of faith," excludes the acts of
   the 4th and 6th sessions from the pope's approval. Döllinger (p. 464),
   contends that the expression conciliariter, "in a conciliar way," is
   opposed to nationaliter, "in the nations." The expression is to be
   taken in its simple meaning, and refers to what was done by the council
   as a council.

   The only other statement made by Martin bearing upon the question
   occurs in his bull Frequens, of Feb. 22, 1418, in which he recognized
   the council as oecumenical, and declared its decrees binding which
   pertained to faith and the salvation of souls--quod sacrum concilium
   Constant., universalem ecclesiam representans approbavit et approbat in
   favorem fidei et salutem animarum, quod hoc est ab universis Christi
   fidelibus approbandum et tenendum. Hefele and Funk show that this
   declaration was not meant to exclude matters which were not of faith,
   for Martin expressly approved other matters, such as those passed upon
   in the 39th session. There is no record that Martin at any time said
   anything to throw light upon his meaning in these two utterances.

   In the latter part of the fifteenth century, as Raynaldus, an. 1418,
   shows, the view came to expression that Martin expressly intended to
   except the action of the 4th and 6th sessions from his papal approval.

   Martin V.'s successor, Eugenius IV., in 1446, thirty years after the
   synod, asserted that its decrees were to be accepted so far as they did
   not prejudice the law, dignity, and pre-eminence of the Apostolic See
   -- absque tamen praejudicio juris et dignitatis et praeeminentiae
   Apost. sedis. The papacy had at that time recovered its prestige, and
   the supreme pontiff felt himself strong enough to openly reassert the
   superiority of the Apostolic See over oecumenical councils. But before
   that time, in a bull issued Dec. 13, 1443, he formally accepted the
   acts of the Council of Basel, the most explicit of which was the
   reaffirmation of the acts of the Council of Constance in its 4th and
   5th sessions.

   It occurs to a Protestant that the Council of Constance would hardly
   have elected Oddo Colonna pope if he had been suspected of being
   opposed to the council's action concerning its own superiority. The
   council would have stultified itself in appointing a man to undo what
   it had solemnly done. And for him to have denied its authority would
   have been, as Döllinger says (p. 159), like a son denying his
   parentage. The emphasis which recent Catholic historians lay upon
   Gregory's authorization of the synod as giving it for the first time an
   oecumenical character is an easy way out of the difficulty, and this
   view forces the recognition of the Roman line of popes as the
   legitimate successors of St. Peter during the years of the schism.

     __________________________________________________________________

   § 17. The council of Basel. 1431-1449.

   Martin V. proved himself to be a capable and judicious ruler, with
   courage enough when the exigency arose. He left Constance May 16, 1418.
   Sigismund, who took his departure the following week, offered him as
   his papal residence Basel, Strassburg, or Frankfurt. France pressed the
   claims of Avignon, but a Colonna could think of no other city than
   Rome, and proceeding by the way of Bern, Geneva, Mantua, and Florence,
   he entered the Eternal city Sept. 28, 1420. [323] The delay was due to
   the struggle being carried on for its possession by the forces of
   Joanna of Naples under Sforza, and the bold chieftain Braccio. [324]
   Martin secured the withdrawal of Joanna's claims by recognizing that
   princess as queen of Naples, and pacified by investing him with Assisi,
   Perugia, Jesi, and Todi.

   Rome was in a desolate condition when Martin reached it, the prey of
   robbers, its streets filled with refuse and stagnant water, its bridges
   decayed, and many of its churches without roofs. Cattle and sheep were
   herded in the spaces of St. Paul's. Wolves attacked the inhabitants
   within the walls. [325] With Martin's arrival a new era was opened.
   This pope rid the city of robbers, so that persons carrying gold might
   go with safety even beyond the walls. He restored the Lateran, and had
   it floored with a new pavement. He repaired the porch of St. Peter's,
   and provided it with a new roof at a cost of 50,000 gold gulden.
   Revolutions within the city ceased. Martin deserves to be honored as
   one of Rome's leading benefactors. His pontificate was an era of peace
   after years of constant strife and bloodshed due to factions within the
   walls and invaders from without. With him its mediaeval history closes,
   and an age of restoration and progress begins. The inscription on
   Martin's tomb in the Lateran, "the Felicity of his Times,"--temporum
   suorum felicitas,--expresses the debt Rome owes to him.

   Among the signs of Martin's interest in religion was his order securing
   the transfer to Rome of some of the bones of Monica, the mother of
   Augustine, and his bull canonizing her. On their reception, Martin made
   a public address in which he said, "Since we possess St. Augustine,
   what do we care for the shrewdness of Aristotle, the eloquence of
   Plato, the reputation of Pythagoras? These men we do not need.
   Augustine is enough. If we want to know the truth, learning, and
   religion, where shall we find one more wise, learned, and holy than St.
   Augustine?"

   As for the promises of Church reforms made at Constance, Martin paid no
   attention to them, and the explanation made by Pastor, that his time
   was occupied with the government of Rome and the improvement of the
   city, is not sufficient to exculpate him. The old abuses in the
   disposition and sale of offices continued. The pope had no intention of
   yielding up the monarchical claims of the papal office. Nor did he
   forget his relatives. One brother, Giordano, was made duke of and
   another, Lorenzo, count of Alba. One of his nephews, Prospero, he
   invested with the purple, 1426. He also secured large tracts of
   territory for his house. [326]

   The council, appointed by Martin at Constance to meet in Pavia,
   convened April, 1423, was sparsely attended, adjourned on account of
   the plague to Siena, and, after condemning the errors of Wyclif and
   Huss, was dissolved March 7, 1424. Martin and his successors feared
   councils, and it was their policy to prevent, if possible, their
   assembling, by all sorts of excuses and delays. Why should the pope
   place himself in a position to hear instructions and receive commands?
   However, Martin could not be altogether deaf to the demands of
   Christendom, or unmindful of his pledge given at Constance. Placards
   were posted up in Rome threatening him if he summoned a council. Under
   constraint and not of free will, he appointed the second council, which
   was to meet in seven years at Basel, 1431, but he died the same year,
   before the time set for its assembling.

   Eugenius IV., the next occupant of the papal throne, 1431-1447, a
   Venetian, had been made bishop of Siena by his maternal uncle, Gregory
   XII., at the age of twenty-four, and soon afterwards was elevated to
   the curia. His pontificate was chiefly occupied with the attempt to
   assert the supremacy of the papacy against the conciliar theory. It
   also witnessed the most notable effort ever made for the union of the
   Greeks with the Western Church.

   By an agreement signed in the conclave which elevated Eugenius, the
   cardinals promised that the successful candidate should advance the
   interests of the impending general council, follow the decrees of the
   Council of Constance in appointing cardinals, consult the sacred
   college in matters of papal administration, and introduce Church
   reforms. Such a compact had been signed by the conclave which elected
   Innocent VI., 1352, and similar compacts by almost every conclave after
   Eugenius down to the Reformation, but all with no result, for, as soon
   as the election was consummated, the pope set the agreement aside and
   pursued his own course.

   On the day set for the opening of the council in Basel, March 7, 1431,
   only a single prelate was present, the abbot of Vezelay. The formal
   opening occurred July 23, but Cardinal Cesarini, who had been appointed
   by Martin and Eugenius to preside, did not appear till Sept. 9. He was
   detained by his duties as papal legate to settle the Hussite
   insurrection in Bohemia. Sigismund sent Duke William of Bavaria as
   protector, and the attendance speedily grew. The number of doctors
   present was larger in comparison to the number of prelates than at
   Constance. A member of the council said that out of 500 members he
   scarcely saw 20 bishops. The rest belonged to the lower orders of the
   clergy, or were laymen. "Of old, bishops had settled the affairs of the
   Church, but now the common herd does it." [327] The most interesting
   personage in the convention was Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini, who came to
   Basel as Cardinal Capranica's secretary. He sat on some of its
   important commissions.

   The tasks set before the council were the completion of the work of
   Constance in instituting reforms, [328] and a peaceful settlement of
   the Bohemian heresy. Admirable as its effort was in both directions, it
   failed of papal favor, and the synod was turned into a constitutional
   battle over papal absolutism and conciliar supremacy. This battle was
   fought with the pen as well as in debate. Nicolas of Cusa, representing
   the scholastic element, advocated, in 1433, the supremacy of councils
   in his Concordantia catholica. The Dominican, John of Turrecremata,
   took the opposite view, and defended the doctrine of papal
   infallibility in his Summa de ecclesia et ejus auctoritate. For years
   the latter writing was the classical authority for the papal
   pretension.

   The business was performed not by nations but by four committees, each
   composed of an equal number of representatives from the four nations
   and elected for a month. When they agreed on any subject, it was
   brought before the council in public session.

   It soon became evident that the synod acknowledged no earthly authority
   above itself, and was in no mood to hear the contrary principle
   defended. On the other hand, Eugenius was not ready to tolerate free
   discussion and the synod's self-assertion, and took the unfortunate
   step of proroguing the synod to Bologna, making the announcement at a
   meeting of the cardinals, Dec. 18, 1431. The bull was made public at
   Basel four weeks later, and made an intense sensation. The synod was
   quick to give its answer, and decided to continue its sittings. This
   was revolution, but the synod had the nations and public opinion back
   of it, as well as the decrees of the Council of Constance. It insisted
   upon the personal presence of Eugenius, and on Feb. 15, 1432, declared
   for its own sovereignty and that a general council might not be
   prorogued or transferred by a pope without its own consent.

   In the meantime Sigismund had received the iron crown at Milan, Nov.
   25, 1431. He was at this period a strong supporter of the council's
   claims. A French synod, meeting at Bourges early in 1432, gave its
   sanction to them, and the University of Paris wrote that Eugenius'
   decree transferring the council was a suggestion of the devil. Becoming
   more bold, the council, at its third session, April 29, 1432, called
   upon the pope to revoke his bull and be present in person. At its
   fourth session, June 20, it decreed that, in case the papal office
   became vacant, the election to fill the vacancy should be held in Basel
   and that, so long as Eugenius remained away from Basel, he should be
   denied the right to create any more cardinals. The council went still
   farther, proceeded to arraign the pope for contumacy, and on Dec. 18
   gave him 60 days in which to appear, on pain of having formal
   proceedings instituted against him.

   Sigismund, who was crowned emperor in Rome the following Spring, May
   31, 1433, was not prepared for such drastic action. He was back again
   in Basel in October, but, with the emperor present or absent, the
   council continued on its course, and repeatedly reaffirmed its superior
   authority, quoting the declarations of the Council of Constance at its
   fourth and fifth sessions. The voice of Western Christendom was against
   Eugenius, as were the most of his cardinals. Under the stress of this
   opposition, and pressed by the revolution threatening his authority in
   Rome, the pope gave way, and in the decree of Dec. 13, 1433, revoked
   his three bulls, beginning with Dec. 18, 1431, which adjourned the
   synod. He asserted he had acted with the advice of the cardinals, but
   now pronounced and declared the "General Council of Bagel legitimate
   from the time of its opening." Any utterance or act prejudicial to the
   holy synod or derogatory to its authority, which had proceeded from
   him, he revoked, annulled, and pronounced utterly void. [329] At the
   same time the pope appointed legates to preside, and they were received
   by the synod. They swore in their own names to accept and defend its
   decrees.

   No revocation of a former decree could have been made more explicit.
   The Latin vocabulary was strained for words. Catholic historians
   refrain from making an argument against the plain meaning of the bull,
   which is fatal to the dogma of papal inerrancy and acknowledges the
   superiority of general councils. At best they pass the decree with as
   little comment as possible, or content themselves with the assertion
   that Eugenius had no idea of confirming the synod's reaffirmation of
   the famous decrees of Constance, or with the suggestion that the pope
   was under duress when he issued the document. [330] Both assumptions
   are without warrant. The pope made no exception whatever when he
   confirmed the acts of the synod "from its opening." As for the
   explanation that the decree was forced, it needs only to be said that
   the revolt made against the pope in Rome, May, 1434, in which the
   Colonna took a prominent part, had not yet broken out, and there was no
   compulsion except that which comes from the judgment that one's case
   has failed. Cesarini, Nicolas of Cusa, Aeneas Sylvius, John, patriarch
   of Antioch, and the other prominent personages at Basel, favored the
   theory of the supreme authority of councils, and they and the synod
   would have resented the papal deliverance if they had surmised its
   utterances meant something different from what they expressly stated.
   Döllinger concludes his treatment of the subject by saying that
   Eugenius' bull was the most positive and unequivocal recognition
   possible of the sovereignty of the council, and that the pope was
   subject to it.

   Eugenius was the last pope, with the exception of Pius IX., who has had
   to flee from Rome. Twenty-five popes had been obliged to escape from
   the city before him. Disguised in the garb of a Benedictine monk, and
   carried part of the way on the shoulders of a sailor, he reached a boat
   on the Tiber, but was recognized and pelted with a shower of stones,
   from which he escaped by lying flat in the boat, covered with a shield.
   Reaching Ostia, he took a galley to Livorno. From there he went to
   Florence. He remained in exile from 1434 to 1443.

   In its efforts to pacify the Hussites, the synod granted them the use
   of the cup, and made other concessions. The causes of their opposition
   to the Church had been expressed in the four articles of Prag. The
   synod introduced an altogether new method of dealing with heretics in
   guaranteeing to the Hussites and their representatives full rights of
   discussion. Having settled the question of its own authority, the synod
   took up measures to reform the Church "in head and members." The number
   of the cardinals was restricted to 24, and proper qualifications
   insisted upon, a measure sufficiently needed, as Eugenius had given the
   red hat to two of his nephews. Annates, payments for the pallium, the
   sale of church dignities, and other taxes which the Apostolic See had
   developed, were abolished. The right of appeal to Rome was curtailed.
   Measures of another nature were the reaffirmation of the law of
   priestly celibacy, [331] and the prohibition of theatricals and other
   entertainments in church buildings and churchyards. In 1439 the synod
   issued a decree on the immaculate conception, by which Mary was
   declared to have always been free from original and actual sin. [332]
   The interference with the papal revenues affecting the entire papal
   household was, in a measure, atoned for by the promise to provide other
   sources. From the monarchical head of the Church, directly appointed by
   God, and responsible to no human tribunal, the supreme pontiff was
   reduced to an official of the council. Another class of measures sought
   to clear Basel of the offences attending a large and promiscuous
   gathering, such as gambling, dancing, and the arts of prostitutes, who
   were enjoined from showing themselves on the streets.

   Eugenius did not sit idly by while his prerogatives were being tampered
   with and an utterly unpapal method of dealing with heretics was being
   pursued. He communicated with the princes of Europe, June 1, 1436,
   complaining of the highhanded measures, such as the withdrawal of the
   papal revenues, the suppression of the prayer for the pope in the
   liturgy, and the giving of a vote to the lower clergy in the synod. At
   that juncture the union with the Greeks, a question which had assumed a
   place of great prominence, afforded the pope the opportunity for
   reasserting his authority and breaking up the council in the Swiss
   city.

   Overtures of union, starting with Constantinople, were made
   simultaneously through separate bodies of envoys sent to the pope and
   the council. The one met Eugenius at Bologna; the other appeared in
   Basel in the summer of 1434. In discussing a place for a joint meeting
   of the representatives of the two communions, the Greeks expressed a
   preference for some Italian city, or Vienna. This exactly suited
   Eugenius, who had even suggested Constantinople as a place of meeting,
   but the synod sharply informed him that the city on the Bosphorus was
   not to be considered. In urging Basel, Avignon, or a city in Savoy, the
   Basel councilmen were losing their opportunity. Two delegations, one
   from the council and one from the pope, appeared in Constantinople,
   1437, proposing different places of meeting.

   When the matter came up for final decision, the council, by a vote of
   355 to 244, decided to continue the meeting at Basel, or, if that was
   not agreeable to the Greeks, then at Avignon. The minority, acting upon
   the pope's preference, decided in favor of Florence or Udine. In a bull
   dated Sept. 18, 1437, and signed by eight cardinals, Eugenius condemned
   the synod for negotiating with the Greeks, pronounced it prorogued,
   and, at the request of the Greeks, as it alleged, transferred the
   council to Ferrara. [333]

   The synod was checkmated, though it did not appreciate its situation.
   The reunion of Christendom was a measure of overshadowing importance,
   and took precedence in men's minds of the reform of Church abuses. The
   Greeks all went to Ferrara. The prelates, who had been at Basel,
   gradually retired across the Alps, including Cardinals Cesarini and
   Nicolas of Cusa. The only cardinal left at Basel was d'Aleman,
   archbishop of Arles. It was now an open fight between the pope and
   council, and it meant either a schism of the Western Church or the
   complete triumph of the papacy. The discussions at Basel were
   characterized by such vehemence that armed citizens had to intervene to
   prevent violence. The conciliar theory was struggling for life. At its
   28th session, October, 1437, the council declared the papal bull null
   and void, and summoned Eugenius within sixty days to appear before it
   in person or by deputy. Four months later, Jan. 24, 1488, it declared
   Eugenius suspended, and, June 25, 1439, at its 34th session, "removed,
   deposed, deprived, and cast him down," as a disturber of the peace of
   the Church, a simoniac and perjurer, incorrigible, and errant from the
   faith, a schismatic, and a pertinacious heretic. [334] Previous to
   this, at its 33d session, it had again solemnly declared for the
   supreme jurisdiction of councils, and denied the pope the right to
   adjourn or transfer a general council. The holding of contrary views,
   it pronounced heresy.

   In the meantime the council at Ferrara had been opened, Jan. 8, 1438,
   and was daily gaining adherents. Charles VII. took the side of
   Eugenius, although the French people, at the synod of Bourges in the
   summer of 1438, accepted, substantially, the reforms proposed by the
   council of Basel. [335] This action, known as the Pragmatic Sanction,
   decided for the superiority of councils, and that they should be held
   every ten years, abolished annates and first-fruits, ordered the large
   benefices filled by elections, and limited the number of cardinals to
   twenty-four. These important declarations, which went back to the
   decrees of the Council of Constance, were the foundations of the
   Gallican liberties.

   The attitude of the German princes and ecclesiastics was one of
   neutrality or of open support of the council at Basel. Sigismund died
   at the close of the year 1437, and, before the election of his
   son-in-law, Albrecht II., as his successor, the electors at Frankfurt
   decided upon a course of neutrality. Albrecht survived his election as
   king of the Romans less than two years, and his uncle, Frederick III.,
   was chosen to take his place. Frederick, after observing neutrality for
   several years, gave his adhesion to Eugenius.

   Unwilling to be ignored and put out of life, the council at Basel,
   through a commission of thirty-two, at whose head stood d'Aleman,
   elected, 1439, Amadeus, duke of Savoy, as pope. [336] After the loss of
   his wife, 1435, Amadeus formed the order of St. Mauritius, and lived
   with several companions in a retreat at Ripaille, on the Lake of
   Geneva. He was a man of large wealth and influential family
   connections. He assumed the name of Felix V., and appointed four
   cardinals. A year after his election, and accompanied by his two sons,
   he entered Basel, and was crowned by Cardinal d'Aleman. The tiara is
   said to have cost 30,000 crowns. Thus Western Christendom again
   witnessed a schism. Felix had the support of Savoy and some of the
   German princes, of Alfonso of Aragon, and the universities of Paris,
   Vienna, Cologne, Erfurt, and Cracow. Frederick III. kept aloof from
   Basel and declined the offer of marriage to Margaret, daughter of Felix
   and widow of Louis of Anjou, with a dowry of 200,000 ducats.

   The papal achievement in winning Frederick III., king of the Romans,
   was largely due to the corruption of Frederick's chief minister, Caspar
   Schlick, and the treachery of Aeneas Sylvius, who deserted one cause
   and master after another as it suited his advantage. From being a
   vigorous advocate of the council, he turned to the side of Eugenius, to
   whom he made a most fulsome confession, and, after passing from the
   service of Felix, he became secretary to Frederick, and proved himself
   Eugenius' most shrewd and pliable agent. He was an adept in diplomacy
   and trimmed his sails to the wind.

   The archbishops of Treves and Cologne, who openly supported the Basel
   assembly, were deposed by Eugenius, 1446. The same year six of the
   electors offered Eugenius their obedience, provided he would recognize
   the superiority of an oecumenical council, and within thirteen months
   call a new council to meet on German soil. Following the advice of
   Aeneas Sylvius, the pope concluded it wise to show a conciliatory
   attitude. Papal delegates appeared at the diet, meeting September,
   1446, and Aeneas was successful in winning over the margrave of
   Brandenburg and other influential princes. The following January he and
   other envoys appeared in Rome as representatives of the archbishop of
   Mainz, Frederick III., and other princes. The result of the
   negotiations was a concordat,--the so-called princes'
   concordat,--Fürsten Konkordat,--by which the pope restored the two
   deposed archbishops, recognized the superiority of general councils,
   and gave to Frederick the right during his lifetime to nominate the
   incumbents of the six bishoprics of Trent, Brixen, Chur, Gurk, Trieste,
   and Pilsen, and to him and his successors the right to fill, subject to
   the pope's approval, 100 Austrian benefices. These concessions Eugenius
   ratified in four bulls, Feb. 5-7, 1447, one of them, the bull
   Salvatoria, declaring that the pope in the previous three bulls had not
   meant to disparage the authority of the Apostolic See, and if his
   successors found his concessions out of accord with the doctrine of the
   fathers, they were to be regarded as void. The agreement was celebrated
   in Rome with the ringing of bells, and was confirmed by Nicolas V. in
   the so-called Vienna Concordat, Feb. 17, 1448. [337]

   Eugenius died Feb. 23, 1447, and was laid at the side of Eugenius III.
   in St. Peter's. He had done nothing to introduce reforms into the
   Church. Like Martin V., he was fond of art, a taste he cultivated
   during his exile in Florence. He succeeded in perpetuating the
   mediaeval view of the papacy, and in delaying the reformation of the
   Church which, when it came, involved the schism in Western Christendom
   which continues to this day.

   The Basel council continued to drag on a tedious and uneventful
   existence. It was no longer in the stream of noticeable events. It
   stultified itself by granting Felix a tenth. In June, 1448, it
   adjourned to Lausanne. Reduced to a handful of adherents, and weary of
   being a synonym for innocuous failure, it voted to accept Nicolas V.,
   Eugenius' successor, as legitimate pope, and then quietly breathed its
   last, April 25, 1449. After courteously revoking his bulls
   anathematizing Eugenius and Nicolas, Felix abdicated. He was not
   allowed to suffer, much less obliged to do penance, for his presumption
   in exercising papal functions. He was made cardinal-bishop of Sabina,
   and Apostolic vicar in Savoy and other regions which had recognized his
   "obedience." Three of his cardinals were admitted to the curia, and
   d'Aleman forgiven. Felix died in Geneva, 1451. [338]

   The Roman Church has not since had an anti-pope. The Council of Basel
   concluded the series of the three councils, which had for their chief
   aims the healing of the papal schism and the reformation of Church
   abuses. They opened with great promise at Pisa, where a freedom of
   discussion prevailed unheard of before, and where the universities and
   their learned representatives appeared as a new element in the
   deliberations of the Church. The healing of the schism was
   accomplished, but the abuses in the Church went on, and under the last
   popes of the fifteenth century became more infamous than they had been
   at any time before. And yet even in this respect these councils were
   not in vain, for they afforded a warning to the Protestant reformers
   not to put their trust even in ecclesiastical assemblies. As for the
   theory of the supremacy of general councils which they had maintained
   with such dignity, it was proudly set aside by later popes in their
   practice and declared fallacious by the Fifth Lateran in 1516, [339]
   and by the dogma of papal infallibility announced at the Council of the
   Vatican, 1870.

   § 18. The Council of Ferrara-Florence. 1438-1445.

   The council of Ferrara witnessed the submission of the Greeks to the
   Roman see. It did not attempt to go into the subject of ecclesiastical
   reforms, and thus vie with the synod at Basel. After sixteen sessions
   held at Ferrara, Eugenius transferred the council, February, 1439, to
   Florence. The reason given was the unhealthy conditions in Ferrara, but
   the real grounds were the offer of the Florentines to aid Eugenius in
   the support of his guests from the East and, by getting away from the
   seaside, to lessen the chances of the Greeks going home before the
   conclusion of the union. In 1442 the council was transferred to Rome,
   where it held two sessions in the Lateran. The sessions at Ferrara,
   Florence, and Rome are listed with the first twenty-five sessions of
   the council of Basel, and together they are counted as the seventeenth
   oecumenical council. [340]

   The schism between the East and the West, dating from the middle of the
   ninth century, while Nicolas I. and Photius were patriarchs
   respectively of Rome and Constantinople, was widened by the crusades
   and the conquest of Constantinople, 1204. The interest in a reunion of
   the two branches of the Church was shown by the discussion at Bari,
   1098, when Anselm was appointed to set forth the differences with
   Greeks, and by the treatments of Thomas Aquinas and other theologians.
   The only notable attempt at reunion was made at the second council of
   Lyons, 1274, when a deputation from the East accepted articles of
   agreement which, however, were rejected by the Eastern churches. In
   1369, the emperor John visited Rome and abjured the schism, but his
   action met with unfavorable response in Constantinople. Delegates
   appeared at Constance, 1418, sent by Manuel Palaeologus and the
   patriarch of Constantinople, [341] and, in 1422, Martin V. despatched
   the Franciscan, Anthony Massanus, to the Bosphorus, with nine articles
   as a basis of union. These articles led on to the negotiations
   conducted at Ferrara.

   Neither Eugenius nor the Greeks deserve any credit for the part they
   took in the conference. The Greeks were actuated wholly by a desire to
   get the assistance of the West against the advance of the Turks, and
   not by religious zeal. So far as the Latins are concerned, they had to
   pay all the expenses of the Greeks on their way to Italy, in Italy, and
   on their way back as the price of the conference. Catholic historians
   have little enthusiasm in describing the empty achievements of
   Eugenius. [342]

   The Greek delegation was large and inspiring, and included the emperor
   and the patriarch of Constantinople. In Venetian vessels rented by the
   pope, the emperor John VI., Palaeologus reached Venice in February,
   1438. [343] He was accorded a brilliant reception, but it is fair to
   suppose that the pleasure he may have felt in the festivities was not
   unmixed with feelings of resentment, when he recalled the sack and
   pillage of his capital, in 1204, by the ancestors of his entertainers.
   John reached Ferrara March 6. The Greek delegation comprised 700
   persons. Eugenius had arrived Jan. 27. In his bull, read in the synod,
   he called the emperor his most beloved son, and the patriarch his most
   pious brother. [344] In a public address delivered by Cardinal
   Cesarini, the differences dividing the two communions were announced as
   four,--the mode of the procession of the Holy Spirit, the use of
   unleavened bread in the eucharist, the doctrine of purgatory, and the
   papal primacy. The discussions exhibit a mortifying spectacle of
   theological clipping and patchwork. They betray no pure zeal for the
   religious interests of mankind. The Greeks interposed all manner of
   dilatory tactics while they lived upon the hospitality of their hosts.
   The Latins were bent upon asserting the supremacy of the Roman bishop.
   The Orientals, moved by considerations of worldly policy, thought only
   of the protection of their enfeebled empire.

   Among the more prominent Greeks present were Bessarion, bishop of Nice,
   Isidore, archbishop of Russian Kief, and Mark Eugenicus, archbishop of
   Ephesus. Bessarion and Isidore remained in the West after the
   adjournment of the council, and were rewarded by Eugenius with the red
   hat. The archbishop of Ephesus has our admiration for refusing to bow
   servilely to the pope and join his colleagues in accepting the articles
   of union. The leaders among the Latins were Cardinals Cesarini and
   Albergati, and the Spaniard Turrecremata, who was also given the red
   hat after the council adjourned.

   The first negotiations concerned matters of etiquette. Eugenius gave a
   private audience to the patriarch, but waived the ceremony of having
   his foot kissed. An important question was the proper seating of the
   delegates, and the Greek emperor saw to it that accurate measurements
   were taken of the seats set apart for the Greeks, lest they should have
   positions of less honor than the Latins. [345] The pope's promise to
   support his guests was arranged by a monthly grant of thirty florins to
   the emperor, twenty-five to the patriarch, four each to the prelates,
   and three to the other visitors. What possible respect could the more
   high-minded Latins have for ecclesiastics, and an emperor, who, while
   engaged on the mission of Church reunion, were willing to be the pope's
   pensioners, and live upon his dole!

   The first common session was not held till Oct. 8, 1438. Most of it was
   taken up with a long address by Bessarion, as was the time of the
   second session by a still longer address by another Greek. The emperor
   did his share in promoting delay by spending most of his time hunting.
   At the start the Greeks insisted there could be no addition to the
   original creed. Again and again they were on the point of withdrawing,
   but were deterred from doing so by dread of the Turks and empty purses.
   [346] A commission of twenty, ten Greeks and ten Latins, was appointed
   to conduct the preliminary discussion on the questions of difference.

   The Greeks accepted the addition made to the Constantinopolitan creed
   by the synod of Toledo, 589, declaring that the Spirit proceeds from
   the Father and the Son, but with the stipulation that they were not to
   be required to introduce the filioque clause when they used the creed.
   They justified their course on the ground that they had understood the
   Latins as holding to the procession from the Father and the Son as from
   two principles. The article of agreement ran: "The Spirit proceeds from
   the Father and the Son eternally and substantially as it were from one
   source and cause." [347]

   In the matter of purgatory, it was decided that immediately at death
   the blessed pass to the beatific vision, a view the Greeks had
   rejected. Souls in purgatory are purified by pain and may be aided by
   the suffrages of the living. At the insistence of the Greeks, material
   fire as an element of purification was left out.

   The use of leavened bread was conceded to the Greeks.

   In the matter of the eucharist, the Greeks, who, after the words, "this
   is my body," make a petition that the Spirit may turn the bread into
   Christ's body, agreed to the view that transubstantiation occurs at the
   use of the priestly words, but stipulated that the confession be not
   incorporated in the written articles.

   The primacy of the Roman bishop offered the most serious difficulty.
   The article of union acknowledged him as "having a primacy over the
   whole world, he himself being the successor of Peter, and the true
   vicar of Christ, the head of the whole Church, the father and teacher
   of all Christians, to whom, in Peter, Christ gave authority to feed,
   govern and rule the universal Church." [348] This remarkable concession
   was modified by a clause in the original document, running, "according
   as it is defined by the acts of the oecumenical councils and by the
   sacred canons." [349] The Latins afterwards changed the clause so as to
   read, "even as it is defined by the oecumenical councils and the holy
   canons." The Latin falsification made the early oecumencial councils a
   witness to the primacy of the Roman pontiff.

   The articles of union were incorporated in a decree [350] beginning
   Laetentur coeli et exultat terra, "Let the heavens rejoice and the
   earth be glad." It declared that the middle wall of partition between
   the Occidental and Oriental churches has been taken down by him who is
   the cornerstone, Christ. The black darkness of the long schism had
   passed away before the ray of concord. Mother Church rejoiced to see
   her divided children reunited in the bonds of peace and love. The union
   was due to the grace of the Holy Ghost. The articles were signed July 5
   by 115 Latins and 33 Greeks, of whom 18 were metropolitans. Archbishop
   Mark of Ephesus was the only one of the Orientals who refused to sign.
   The patriarch of Constantinople had died a month before, but wrote
   approving the union. His body lies buried in S. Maria Novella,
   Florence. His remains and the original manuscript of the articles,
   which is preserved in the Laurentian library at Florence, are the only
   relics left of the union.

   On July 6, 1439, the articles were publicly read in the cathedral of
   Florence, the Greek text by Bessarion, and the Latin by Cesarini. The
   pope was present and celebrated the mass. The Latins sang hymns in
   Latin, and the Greeks followed them with hymns of their own. Eugenius
   promised for the defence of Constantinople a garrison of three hundred
   and two galleys and, if necessary, the armed help of Western
   Christendom. After tarrying for a month to receive the five months of
   arrearages of his stipend, the emperor returned by way of Venice to his
   capital, from which he had been absent two years.

   The Ferrara agreement proved to be a shell of paper, and all the parade
   and rejoicing at the conclusion of the proceedings were made ridiculous
   by the utter rejection of its articles in Constantinople.

   On their return, the delegates were hooted as Azymites, the name given
   in contempt to the Latins for using unleavened bread in the eucharist.
   Isidore, after making announcement of the union at Of en, was seized
   and put into a convent, from which he escaped two years later to Rome.
   The patriarchs of Jerusalem, Antioch, and Alexandria issued a letter
   from Jerusalem, 1443, denouncing the council of Florence as a synod of
   robbers and Metrophanes, the Byzantine patriarch as a matricide and
   heretic.

   It is true the articles were published in St. Sophia, Dec. 14, 1452, by
   a Latin cardinal, but six months later, Constantinople was in the hands
   of the Mohammedans. A Greek council, meeting in Constantinople, 1472,
   formally rejected the union.

   On the other hand, the success of the Roman policy was announced
   through Western Europe. Eugenius' position was strengthened by the
   empty triumph, and in the same proportion the influence of the Basel
   synod lessened. If cordial relations between churches of the East and
   the West were not promoted at Ferrara and Florence, a beneficent
   influence flowed from the council in another direction by the diffusion
   of Greek scholarship and letters in the West.

   Delegations also from the Armenians and Jacobites appeared at Florence
   respectively in 1439 and 1442. The Copts and Ethiopians also sent
   delegations, and it seemed as if the time had arrived for the reunion
   of all the distracted parts of Christendom. [351] A union with the
   Armenians, announced Nov. 22, 1439, declared that the Eastern delegates
   had accepted the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Son and the
   Chalcedon Council giving Christ two natures and by implication two
   wills. The uniate Armenians have proved true to the union. The Armenian
   catholicos, Gregory IX., who attempted to enforce the union, was
   deposed, and the Turks, in 1461, set up an Armenian patriarch, with
   seat at Constantinople. The union of the Jacobites, proclaimed in 1442,
   was universally disowned in the East. The attempts to conciliate the
   Copts and Ethiopians were futile. Eugenius sent envoys to the East to
   apprise the Maronites and the Nestorians of the efforts at reunion. The
   Nestorians on the island of Cyprus submitted to Rome, and a century
   later, during the sessions of the Fifth Lateran, 1516, the Maronites
   were received into the Roman communion.

   On Aug. 7, 1445, Eugenius adjourned the long council which had begun
   its sittings at Basel, continued them at Ferrara and Florence, and
   concluded them in the Lateran.

   § 20. Ockam and the Decay of Scholasticism.

   Scholasticism had its last great representative in Duns Scotus, d.
   1308. After him the scholastic method gradually passed into disrepute.
   New problems were thrust upon the mind of Western Europe, and new
   interests were engaging its attention. The theologian of the school and
   the convent gave way to the practical theological disputant setting
   forth his views in tracts and on the floor of the councils. Free
   discussion broke up the hegemony of dogmatic assertion. The authority
   of the Fathers and of the papacy lost its exclusive hold, and thinkers
   sought another basis of authority in the general judgment of
   contemporary Christendom, in the Scriptures alone or in reason. The new
   interest in letters and the natural world drew attention away from
   labored theological systems which were more adapted to display the
   ingenuity of the theologian than to be of practical value to society.
   The use of the spoken languages of Europe in literature was fitted to
   force thought into the mould of current exigencies. The discussions of
   Roger Bacon show that at the beginning of the fourteenth century men's
   minds, sated with abstruse metaphysical solutions of theological
   questions, great and trivial, were turning to a world more real and
   capable of proof.

   The chief survivors of the dialectical Schoolmen were Durandus and
   William Ockam. Gabriel Biel of Tübingen, who died just before the close
   of the fifteenth century, is usually called the last of the Schoolmen.
   [352] Such men as D'Ailly, Gerson and Wyclif, sometimes included under
   the head of mediaeval scholastics, evidently belong to another class.

   A characteristic feature of the scholasticism of Durandus and Ockam is
   the sharper distinction they made between reason and revelation.
   Following Duns Scotus, they declared that doctrines peculiar to
   revealed theology are not susceptible of proof by pure reason. The body
   of dogmatic truth, as accepted by the Church, they did not question.

   A second characteristic is the absence of originality. They elaborated
   what they received. The Schoolmen of former periods had exhausted the
   list of theological questions and discussed them from every standpoint.

   The third characteristic is the revival and ascendency of nominalism,
   the principle Roscellinus advocated more than two hundred years before.
   The Nominalists were also called Terminists, because they represent
   words as terms which do not necessarily have ideas and realities to
   correspond to them. A universal is simply a symbol or term for a number
   of things or for that which is common to a number of things. [353]
   Universality is nothing more than a mode of mental conception. The
   University of Paris resisted the spread of nominalism, and in 1839 the
   four nations forbade the promulgation of Ockam's doctrine or listening
   to its being expounded in private or public. [354] In 1473, Louis XI.
   issued a mandate forbidding the doctors at Paris teaching it, and
   prohibiting the use of the writings of Ockam, Marsiglius and other
   writers. In 1481 the law was rescinded.

   Durandus, known as doctor resolutissimus, the resolute doctor, d. 1334,
   was born at Pourçain, in the diocese of Clermont, entered the Dominican
   order, was appointed by Fohn XXII. bishop of Limoux, 1317, and was
   later elevated to the sees of Puy and Meaux. He attacked some of the
   rules of the Franciscans and John XXII.'s theory of the beatific
   vision, and in 1333 was declared by a commission guilty of eleven
   errors. His theological views are found in his commentary on the
   Lombard, begun when he was a young man and finished in his old age. He
   showed independence by assailing some of the views of Thomas Aquinas.
   He went beyond his predecessors in exalting the Scriptures above
   tradition and pronouncing their statements more authoritative than the
   dicta of Aristotle and other philosophers. [355] All real existence is
   in the individual. The universal is not an entity which can be divided
   as a chunk of wood is cut into pieces. The universal, the unity by
   which objects are grouped together as a class, is deduced from
   individuals by an act of the mind. That which is common to a class has,
   apart from the individuals of the class, no real existence.

   On the doctrine of the eucharist Durandus seems not to have been fully
   satisfied with the view held by the Church, and suggested that the
   words "this is my body," may mean "contained under"--contentum sub hoc.
   This marks an approach to Luther's view of consubstantiation. This
   theologian was held in such high esteem by Gerson that he recommended
   him, together with Thomas Aquinas, Bradwardine and Henry of Ghent, to
   the students of the college of Navarre. [356]

   The most profound scholastic thinker of the fourteenth century was the
   Englishman, William Ockam, d. 1349, called doctor invincibilis, the
   invincible doctor, or, with reference to his advocacy of nominalism,
   venerabilis inceptor, the venerable inaugurator. His writings, which
   were more voluminous than lucid, were much published at the close of
   the fifteenth century, but have not been put into print for several
   hundred years. There is no complete edition of them. Ockam's views
   combined elements which were strictly mediaeval, and elements which
   were adopted by the Reformers and modern philosophy. His identification
   with the cause of the Spiritual Franciscans involved him in controversy
   with two popes, John XXII. and Benedict XII. His denial of papal
   infallibility has the appearance not 80 much of a doctrine proceeding
   from theological conviction as the chance weapon laid hold of in time
   of conflict to protect the cause of the Spirituals.

   Of the earlier period of Ockam's life, little is known. He was born in
   Surrey, studied at Oxford, where he probably was a student of Duns
   Scotus, entered the Franciscan order, and was probably master in Paris,
   1315-1320. For his advocacy of the doctrine of Christ's absolute
   poverty he was, by order of John XXII., tried and found guilty and
   thrown into confinement. [357] With the aid of Lewis the Bavarian, he
   and his companions, Michael of Cesena and Bonagratia, escaped in 1328
   to Pisa. from that time on, the emperor and the Schoolman, as already
   stated, defended one another. Ockam accompanied the emperor to Munich
   and was excommunicated. At Cesena's death the Franciscan seal passed
   into his hands, but whatever authority he possessed he resigned the
   next year into the hands of the acknowledged Franciscan general,
   Farinerius. Clement VI. offered him absolution on condition of his
   abjuring his errors. Whether he accepted the offer or not is unknown.
   He died at Munich and is buried there. The distinguished Englishman
   owes his reputation to his revival of nominalism, his political
   theories and his definition of the final seat of religious authority.

   His theory of nominalism was explicit, and offered no toleration to the
   realism of the great Schoolmen from Anselm on. Individual things alone
   have factual existence. The universals are mere terms or symbols,
   fictions of the mind--fictiones, signa mentalia, nomina, signa
   verbalia. They are like images in a mirror. A universal stands for an
   intellectual act--actus intelligenda -- and nothing more. Did ideas
   exist in God's mind as distinct entities, then the visible world would
   have been created out of them and not out of nothing. [358]

   Following Duns Scotus, Ockam taught determinism. God's absolute will
   makes things what they are. Christ might have become wood or stone if
   God had so chosen. In spite of Aristotle, a body might have different
   kinds of motion at the same time. In the department of morals, what is
   now bad might have been good, if God had so willed it.

   In the department of civil government, Ockam, advocating the position
   taken by the electors at Rense, 1338, declared the emperor did not need
   the confirmation of the pope. The imperial office is derived
   immediately from God. [359] The Church is a priestly institution,
   administers the sacraments and shows men the way of salvation, but has
   no civil jurisdiction, [360] potestas coactiva.

   The final seat of authority, this thinker found in the Scriptures.
   Truths such as the Trinity and the incarnation cannot be deduced by
   argument. The being of God cannot be proven from the so-called idea of
   God. A plurality of gods may be proven by the reason as well as the
   existence of the one God. Popes and councils may err. The Bible alone
   is inerrant. A Christian cannot be held to believe anything not in the
   Scriptures. [361]

   The Church is the community of the faithful--communitas, or congregatio
   fidelium. [362] The Roman Church is not identical with it, and this
   body of Christians may exist independently of the Roman Church. If the
   pope had plenary power, the law of the Gospel would be more galling
   than the law of Moses. All would then be the pope's slaves. [363] The
   papacy is not a necessary institution.

   In the doctrine of the eucharist, Ockam represents the traditional view
   as less probable than the view that Christ's body is at the side of the
   bread. This theory of impanation, which Rupert of Deutz taught,
   approached Luther's theory of consubstantiation. However, Ockam
   accepted the Church's view, because it was the less intelligible and
   because the power of God is unlimited. John of Paris, d. 1308, had
   compared the presence of Christ in the elements to the co-existence of
   two natures in the incarnation and was deposed from his chair at the
   University of Paris, 1304. Gabriel Biel took a similar view. [364]

   Ockam's views on the authority of the civil power, papal errancy, the
   infallibility of the Scriptures and the eucharist are often compared
   with the views of Luther. [365] The German reformer spoke of the
   English Schoolman as "without doubt the leader and most ingenious of
   the Schoolmen"--scholasticorum doctorum sine dubio princeps et
   ingeniosissimus. He called him his "dear teacher," and declared himself
   to be of Ockam's party--sum Occamicae factionis. [366] The two men
   were, however, utterly unlike. Ockam was a theorist, not a reformer,
   and in spite of his bold sayings, remained a child of the mediaeval
   age. He started no party or school in theological matters. Luther
   exalted personal faith in the living Christ. He discovered new
   principles in the Scriptures, and made them the active forces of
   individual and national belief and practice. We might think of Luther
   as an Ockam if he had lived in the fourteenth century. We cannot think
   of Ockam as a reformer in the sixteenth century. He would scarcely have
   renounced monkery. Ockam's merit consists in this that, in common with
   Marsiglius and other leaders of thought, he imbibed the new spirit of
   free discussion, and was bold enough to assail the traditional dogmas
   of his time. In this way he contributed to the unsettlement of the
   pernicious mediaeval theory of the seat of authority.

   [352] Seeberg gives a good deal of attention to Biel in his
   Dogmengeschichte. Stöckl carries the history of scholasticism down to
   Cardinal Cajetan, who wrote a commentary on Thomas Aquinas'
   Summatheologica, and includes the German mystics, Eck, Luther, etc.,
   who clearly belong in another category. Professor Seth, in art.
   Scholasticism in the Enc. Brit., and Werner, close the history with
   Francis Suarez, 1617. The new age had begun a hundred years before that
   time.

   § 21. Catherine of Siena, the Saint.

   Next to Francis d'Assisi, the most celebrated of the Italian saints is
   Catherine of Siena--Caterina da Siena--1347-1380. With Elizabeth of
   Thuringia, who lived more than a century before her, she is the most
   eminent of the holy women of the Middle Ages whom the Church has
   canonized. Her fame depends upon her single-hearted piety and her
   efforts to advance the interests of the Church and her nation. She left
   no order to encourage the reverence for her name. She was the most
   public of all the women of the Middle Ages in Italy, and yet she passed
   unscathed and without a taint through streets and in courts. Now, as
   the daughter of an humble citizen of Siena, she ministers to the poor
   and the sick: now, as the prophetess of heaven, she appeals to the
   conscience of popes and of commonwealths. Her native Sienese have
   sanctified her with the fragrant name la beata poplana, the blessed
   daughter of the people. Although much in her career, as it has been
   handed down by her confessor and biographer, may seem to be legendary,
   and although the hysterical element may not be altogether wanting from
   her piety, she yet deserves and will have the admiration of all men who
   are moved by the sight of a noble enthusiasm. It would require a
   fanatical severity to read the account of her unwearied efforts and the
   letters, into which she equally poured the fire of her soul, without
   feeling that the Sienese saint was a very remarkable woman, the
   Florence Nightingale of her time or more, "one of the most wonderful
   women that have ever lived," as her most recent English biographer has
   pronounced her. Or, shall we join Gregorovius, the thorough student of
   mediaeval Rome, in saying, "Catherine's figure flits like that of an
   angel: through the darkness of her time, over which her gracious genius
   sheds a soft radiance. Her life is more worthy and assuredly a more
   human subject for history than the lives of the popes of her age."
   [367]

   Catherine Benincasa was the twenty-third of a family of twenty-five
   children. Her twin sister, Giovanna, died in infancy. Her father was a
   dyer in prosperous circumstances. Her mother, Monna Lapa, survived the
   daughter. Catherine treated her with filial respect, wrote her letters,
   several of which are extant, and had her with her on journeys and in
   Rome during her last days there. Catherine had no school training, and
   her knowledge of reading and writing she acquired after she was grown
   up.

   As a child she was susceptible to religious impressions, and frequented
   the Dominican church near her father's home. The miracles of her
   earlier childhood were reported by her confessor and biographer,
   Raymund of Capua. At twelve her parents arranged for her a marriage,
   but to avoid it Catherine cut off her beautiful hair. She joined the
   tertiary order of the Dominicans, the women adherents being called the
   mantellate from their black mantles. Raymund declares "that nature had
   not given her a face over-fair," and her personal appearance was marred
   by the marks of the smallpox. And yet she had a winning expression, a
   fund of good spirits, and sang and laughed heartily. Once devoted to a
   religious life, she practised great austerities, flagellating herself
   three times a day,--once for herself, once for the living and once for
   the dead. She wore a hair undergarment and an iron chain. During one
   Lenten season she lived on the bread taken in communion. These
   asceticisms were performed in a chamber in her father's house. She was
   never an inmate of a convent. Such extreme asceticisms as she practised
   upon herself she disparaged at a later period.

   At an early age Catherine became the subject of visions and
   revelations. On one of these occasions and after hours of dire
   temptation, when she was tempted to live like other girls, the Saviour
   appeared to her stretched on the cross and said: "My own daughter,
   Catherine, seest thou how much I have suffered for thee? Let it not be
   hard for thee to suffer for me." Thrilled with the address, she asked:
   "Where wert thou, Lord, when I was tempted with such impurity?" and He
   replied, "In thy heart." In 1367, according to her own statement, the
   Saviour betrothed himself to her, putting a ring on her finger. The
   ring was ever afterwards visible to herself though unseen by others.
   Five years before her death, she received the stigmata directly from
   Christ. Their impression gave sharp pain, and Catherine insisted that,
   though they likewise were invisible to others, they were real to her.

   In obedience to a revelation, Catherine renounced the retired life she
   had been living, and at the age of twenty began to appear in public and
   perform the active offices of charity. This was in 1367. She visited
   the poor and sick, and soon became known as the ministering angel of
   the whole city. During the plague of 1374, she was indefatigable by day
   and night, healed those of whom the physicians despaired, and she even
   raised the dead. The lepers outside the city walls she did not neglect.

   One of the remarkable incidents in her career which she vouches for in
   one of her letters to Raymund was her treatment of Niccolo Tuldo, a
   young nobleman condemned to die for having uttered words disrespectful
   of the city government. The young man was in despair, but under
   Catherine's influence he not only regained composure, but became joyful
   in the prospect of death. Catherine was with him at the block and held
   his head. She writes, "I have just received a head into my hands which
   was to me of such sweetness as no heart can think, or tongue describe."
   Before the execution she accompanied the unfortunate man to the mass,
   where he received the communion for the first time. His last words were
   "naught but Jesus and Catherine. And, so saying," wrote his
   benefactress, "I received his head in my hands." She then saw him
   received of Christ, and as she further wrote, "When he was at rest, my
   soul rested in peace, in so great fragrance of blood that I could not
   bear to remove the blood which had fallen on me from him."

   The fame of such a woman could not be held within the walls of her
   native city. Neighboring cities and even the pope in Avignon heard of
   her deeds of charity and her revelations. The guide of minds seeking
   the consolations of religion, the minister to the sick and dying,
   Catherine now entered into the wider sphere of the political life of
   Italy and the welfare of the Church. Her concern was divided between
   efforts to support the papacy and to secure the amelioration of the
   clergy and establish peace. With the zeal of a prophet, she urged upon
   Gregory XI. to return to Rome. She sought to prevent the rising of the
   Tuscan cities against the Avignon popes and to remove the interdict
   which was launched against Florence, and she supported Urban VI.
   against the anti-pope, Clement VII. With equal fervor she urged Gregory
   to institute a reformation of the clergy, to allow no weight to
   considerations of simony and flattery in choosing cardinals and pastors
   and "to drive out of the sheep-fold those wolves, those demons
   incarnate, who think only of good cheer, splendid feasts and superb
   liveries." She also was zealous in striving to stir up the flames of a
   new crusade. To Sir John Hawkwood, the freelance and terror of the
   peninsula, she wrote, calling upon him that, as he took such pleasure
   in fighting, he should thenceforth no longer direct his arms against
   Christians, but against the infidels. She communicated to the Queen of
   Cyprus on the subject. Again and again she urged it upon Gregory XI.,
   and chiefly on the grounds that he "might minister the blood of the
   Lamb to the wretched infidels," and that converted, they might aid in
   driving pride and other vices out of the Christian world. [368]

   Commissioned by Gregory, she journeyed to Pisa to influence the city in
   his favor. She was received with honors by the archbishop and the head
   of the republic, and won over two professors who visited her with the
   purpose of showing her she was self-deceived or worse. She told them
   that it was not important for her to know how God had created the
   world, but that "it was essential to know that the Son of God had taken
   our human nature and lived and died for our salvation." One of the
   professors, removing his crimson velvet cap, knelt before her and asked
   for forgiveness. Catherine's cures of the sick won the confidence of
   the people. On this visit she was accompanied by her mother and a group
   of like-minded women.

   A large chapter in Catherine's life is interwoven with the history of
   Florence. The spirit of revolt against the Avignon regime was rising in
   upper Italy and, when the papal legate in Bologna, in a year of dearth,
   forbade the transportation of provisions to Florence, it broke out into
   war. At the invitation of the Florentines, Catherine visited the city,
   1375 and, a year later, was sent as a delegate to Avignon to negotiate
   terms of peace. She was received with honor by the pope, but not
   without hesitancy. The other members of the delegation, when they
   arrived, refused to recognize her powers and approve her methods. The
   cardinals treated her coolly or with contempt, and women laid snares at
   her devotions to bring ridicule upon her. Such an attempt was made by
   the pope's niece, Madame de Beaufort Turenne, who knelt at her side and
   ran a sharp knife into her foot so that she limped from the wound.

   The dyer's daughter now turned her attention to the task of confirming
   the supreme pontiff in his purpose to return to Rome and counteract the
   machinations of the cardinals against its execution. Seeing her desire
   realized, she started back for Italy and, met by her mother at Leghorn,
   went on to Florence, carrying a commission from the pope. Her effort to
   induce the city to bow to the sentence of interdict, which had been
   laid upon it, was in a measure successful. Her reverence for the papal
   office demanded passive obedience. Gregory's successor, Urban VI.,
   lifted the ban. Catherine then returned to Siena where she dictated the
   Dialogue, a mystical treatise inculcating prayer, obedience, discretion
   and other virtues. Catherine declared that God alone had been her guide
   in its composition.

   In the difficulties, which arose soon after Urban's election, that
   pontiff looked to Siena and called its distinguished daughter to Rome.
   They had met in Avignon. Accompanied by her mother and other
   companions, she reached the holy city in the Autumn of 1378. They
   occupied a house by themselves and lived upon alms. [369] Her summons
   to Urban "to battle only with the weapons of repentance, prayer, virtue
   and love" were not heeded. Her presence, however, had a beneficent
   influence, and on one occasion, when the mob raged and poured into the
   Vatican, she appeared as a peacemaker, and the sight of her face and
   her words quieted the tumult.

   She died lying on boards, April 29, 1380. To her companions standing at
   her side, she said: "Dear children, let not my death sadden you, rather
   rejoice to think that I am leaving a place of many sufferings to go to
   rest in the quiet sea, the eternal God, and to be united forever with
   my most sweet and loving Bridegroom. And I promise to be with you more
   and to be more useful to you, since I leave darkness to pass into the
   true and everlasting light." Again and again she whispered, "I have
   sinned, O Lord; be merciful to me." She prayed for Urban, for the whole
   Church and for her companions, and then she departed, repeating the
   words, "Into thy hands I commit my spirit."

   At the time of her death Catherine of Siena was not yet thirty-three
   years old. A magnificent funeral was ordered by Urban. A year after,
   her head, enclosed in a reliquary, was sent to her native Siena, and in
   1461 she was canonized by the city's famous son, pope Pius II., who
   uttered the high praise "that none ever approached her without going
   away better." In 1865 when Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome was
   reopened, her ashes were carried through the streets, the silver urn
   containing them being borne by four bishops. Lamps are kept ever
   burning at the altar dedicated to her in the church. In 1866 Pius IX.
   elevated the dyer's daughter to the dignity of patron saint and
   protectress of Rome, a dignity she shares with the prince of the
   Apostles. With Petrarch she had been the most ardent advocate of its
   claims as the papal residence, and her zeal was exclusively religious.

   In her correspondence and Dialogue we have the biography of Catherine's
   soul. Nearly four hundred of her letters are extant. [370] Not only
   have they a place of eminence as the revelations of a saintly woman's
   thoughts and inner life, but are, next to the letters written by
   Petrarch, the chief specimens of epistolary literature of the
   fourteenth century. She wrote to persons of all classes, to her mother,
   the recluse in the cloister, her confessor, Raymund of Capua, to men
   and women addicted to the pleasures of the world, to the magistrates of
   cities, queens and kings, to cardinals, and to the popes, Gregory XI.
   and Urban VI., gave words of counsel, set forth at length measures and
   motives of action, used the terms of entreaty and admonition, and did
   not hesitate to employ threats of divine judgment, as in writing to the
   Queen of Naples. They abound in wise counsels.

   The correspondence shows that Catherine had some acquaintance with the
   New Testament from which she quotes the greater precepts and draws
   descriptions from the miracle of the water changed into wine and the
   expulsion of the moneychangers from the temple and such parables as the
   ten virgins and the marriage-feast. One of her most frequent
   expressions is the blood of Christ, and in truly mystical or conventual
   manner she bids her correspondents, even the pope and the cardinals,
   bathe and drown and inebriate themselves in it, yea, to clothe and fill
   themselves with it, "for Christ did not buy us with gold or silver or
   pearls or other precious stones, but with his own precious blood."
   [371]

   To Catherine the religious life was a subjection of the will to the
   will of God and the outgoing of the soul in exercises of prayer and the
   practice of love. "I want you to wholly destroy your own will that it
   may cling to Christ crucified." So she wrote to a mother bereft of her
   children. Writing to the recluse, Bartolomea della Seta, she
   represented the Saviour as saying, "Sin and virtue consist in the
   consent of the will, there is no sin or virtue unless voluntarily
   wrought."

   To another she wrote, "I have already seen many penitents who have been
   neither patient nor obedient because they have studied to kill their
   bodies but not their wills." [372]

   Her sound religious philosophy showed itself in insisting again and
   again that outward discipline is not the only or always the best way to
   secure the victory of the spirit. If the body is weak or fallen into
   illness, the rule of discretion sets aside the exercises of bodily
   discipline. She wrote, "Not only should fasting be abandoned but flesh
   be eaten and, if once a day is not enough, then four times a day."
   Again and again she treats of penance as an instrument. "The little
   good of penance may hinder the greater good of inward piety. Penance
   cuts off," so she wrote in a remarkable letter to Sister Daniella of
   Orvieto, "yet thou wilt always find the root in thee, ready to sprout
   again, but virtue pulls up by the root."

   Monastic as Catherine was, yet no evangelical guide-book could write
   more truly than she did in most particulars. And at no point does this
   noble woman rise higher than when she declined to make her own states
   the standard for others, and condemned those "who, indiscreetly, want
   to measure all bodies by one and the same measure, the measure by which
   they measure themselves." Writing to her niece, Nanna Benincasa, she
   compared the heart to a lamp, wide above and narrow below. A bride of
   Christ must have lamp and oil and light. The heart should be wide
   above, filled with holy thoughts and prayer, bearing in memory the
   blessings of God, especially the blessing of the blood by which we are
   bought. And like a lamp, it should be narrow below, "not loving or
   desiring earthly things in excess nor hungering for more than God wills
   to give us."

   To the Christian virtues of prayer and love she continually returns.
   Christian love is compared to the sea, peaceful and profound as God
   Himself, for "God is love." This passage throws light upon the
   unsearchable mystery of the Incarnate Word who, constrained by love,
   gave Himself up in all humility. We love because we are loved. He loves
   of grace, and we love Him of duty because we are bound to do so; and to
   show our love to Him we ought to serve and love every rational creature
   and extend our love to good and bad, to all kinds of people, as much to
   one who does us ill as to one who serves us, for God is no respecter of
   persons, and His charity extends to just men and sinners. Peter's love
   before Pentecost was sweet but not strong. After Pentecost he loved as
   a son, bearing all tribulations with patience. So we, too, if we remain
   in vigil and continual prayer and tarry ten days, shall receive the
   plenitude of the Spirit. More than once in her letters to Gregory, she
   bursts out into a eulogy of love as the remedy for all evils. "The soul
   cannot live without love," she wrote in the Dialogue, "but must always
   love something, for it was created through love. Affection moves the
   understanding, as it were, saying, 'I want to love, for the food
   wherewith I am fed is love.' " [373]

   Such directions as these render Catherine's letters a valuable manual
   of religious devotion, especially to those who are on their guard
   against being carried away by the underlying quietistic tone. Not only
   do they have a high place as the revelation of a pious woman's soul.
   They deal with unconcealed boldness and candor with the low conditions
   into which the Church was fallen. Popes are called upon to institute
   reforms in the appointment of clergymen and to correct abuses in other
   directions. As for the pacification of the Tuscan cities, a cause which
   lay so close to Catherine's heart, she urged the pontiff to use the
   measures of peace and not of war, to deal as a father would deal with a
   rebellious son,--to put into practice clemency, not the pride of
   authority. Then the very wolves would nestle in his bosom like lambs.
   [374]

   As for the pope's return to Rome, she urged it as a duty he owed to God
   who had made him His vicar. In view of the opposition on the Rhone,
   almost holding him as by physical force, she called upon him to "play
   the man," "to be a manly man, free from fear and fleshly love towards
   himself or towards any creature related to him by kin," "to be stable
   in his resolution and to believe and trust in Christ in spite of all
   predictions of the evil to follow his return to Rome." [375] To this
   impassioned Tuscan woman, the appointment of unworthy shepherds and bad
   rectors was responsible for the rebellion against papal authority,
   shepherds who, consumed by self-love, far from dragging Christ's sheep
   away from the wolves, devoured the very sheep themselves. It was
   because they did not follow the true Shepherd who has given His life
   for the sheep. Likening the Church to a garden, she invoked the pope to
   uproot the malodorous plants full of avarice, impurity and pride, to
   throw them away that the bad priests and rulers who poison the garden
   might no longer have rule. To Urban VI. she addressed burning words of
   condemnation. "Your sons nourish themselves on the wealth they receive
   by ministering the blood of Christ, and are not ashamed of being
   money-changers. In their great avarice they commit simonies, buying
   benefices with gifts or flatteries or gold." And to the papal legate of
   Bologna, Cardinal d'Estaing, she wrote, "make the holy father consider
   the loss of souls more than the loss of cities, for God demands souls."

   The stress Catherine laid upon the pope's responsibility to God and her
   passionate reproof of an unworthy and hireling ministry, inclined some
   to give her a place among the heralds of the Protestant Reformation.
   Flacius Illyricus included her in the list of his witnesses for the
   truth--Catalogus testium veritatis. [376] With burning warmth she spoke
   of a thorough-going reformation which was to come upon the Church. "The
   bride, now all deformed and clothed in rags," she exclaimed, "will then
   gleam with beauty and jewels, and be crowned with the diadem of all
   virtues. All believing nations will rejoice to have excellent
   shepherds, and the unbelieving world, attracted by her glory, will be
   converted unto her." Infidel peoples would be brought into the Catholic
   fold,--ovile catholicum,--and be converted unto the true pastor and
   bishop of souls. But Catherine, admirable as these sentiments were,
   moved within the limits of the mediaeval Church. She placed piety back
   of penitential exercises in love and prayer and patience, but she never
   passed beyond the ascetic and conventual conception of the Christian
   life into the open air of liberty through faith. She had the spirit of
   Savonarola, the spirit of fiery self-sacrifice for the well-being of
   her people and the regeneration of Christendom, but she did not see
   beyond the tradition of the past. Living a hundred years and more
   before the Florentine prophet, she was excelled by none in her own age
   and approached by none of her own nation in the century between her and
   Savonarola, in passionate effort to save her people and help spread
   righteousness. Hers was the voice of the prophet, crying in the
   wilderness, "Prepare ye the way of the Lord."

   In recalling the women of the century from 1350 to 1450, the mind
   easily associates together Catherine of Siena and Joan of Arc,
   1411-1431, one the passionate advocate of the Church, the other of the
   national honor of France. The Maid of Orleans, born of peasant
   parentage, was only twenty when she was burnt at the stake on the
   streets of Rouen, 1431. Differing from her Italian sister by comeliness
   of form and robustness of constitution, she also, as she thought, was
   the subject of angelic communications and divine guidance. Her
   unselfish devotion to her country at first brought it victory, but, at
   last, to her capture and death. Her trial by the English on the charges
   of heresy and sorcery and her execution are a dark sheet among the
   pages of her century's history. Twenty-five years after her death, the
   pope revoked the sentence, and the French heroine, whose standard was
   embroidered with lilies and adorned with pictures of the creation and
   the annunciation, was beatified, 1909, and now awaits the crown of
   canonization from Rome. The exalted passion of these two women, widely
   as they differ in methods and ideals and in the close of their careers,
   diffuses a bright light over the selfish pursuits of their time, and
   makes the aims of many of its courts look low and grovelling.

   § 22. Peter d'Ailly, Ecclesiastical Statesman.

   One of the most prominent figures in the negotiations for the healing
   of the papal schism, as well as one of the foremost personages of his
   age, was Peter d'Ailly, born in Compiegne 1350, died in Avignon 1420.
   His eloquence, which reminds us of Bossuet and other French orators of
   the court of Louis XIV., won for him the title of the Eagle of
   France--aquila Francia. [377]

   In 1372 he entered the College of Navarre as a theological student,
   prepared a commentary on the Sentences of the Lombard three years
   later, and in 1380 reached the theological doctorate. He at once became
   involved in the measures for the healing of the schism, and in 1381
   delivered a celebrated address in the name of the university before the
   French regent, the duke of Anjou, to win the court for the policy of
   settling the papal controversy through a general council. His appeal
   not meeting with favor, he retired to Noyon, from which he wrote a
   letter purporting to come from the devil, a satire based on the
   continuance of the schism, in which the prince of darkness called upon
   his friends and vassals, the prelates, to follow his example in
   promoting division in the Church. He warned them as their overlord that
   the holding of a council might result in establishing peace and so
   bring eternal shame upon them. He urged them to continue to make the
   Church a house of merchandise and to be careful to tithe anise and
   cummin, to make broad the borders of their garments and in every other
   way to do as he had given them an example. [378]

   In 1384 D'Ailly was made head of the College of Navarre, where he had
   Gerson for a pupil, and in 1389 chancellor of the university.

   When Benedict XIII. was chosen successor to Clement VII., he was sent
   by the French king on a confidential mission to Avignon. Benedict won
   his allegiance and appointed him successively bishop of Puy, 1395, and
   bishop of Cambray, 1397. D'Ailly was with Benedict at Genoa, 1405, and
   Savona, 1407, but by that time seems to have come to the conclusion
   that Benedict was not sincere in his profession of readiness to resign,
   and returned to Cambray. In his absence Cambray had decided for the
   subtraction of its allegiance from Avignon. D'Ailly was seized and
   taken to Paris, but protected by the king, who was his friend.
   Thenceforth he favored the assemblage of a general council.

   At Pisa and at Constance, D'Ailly took the position that a general
   council is superior to the pope and may depose him. Made a cardinal by
   John XXIII., 1411, he attended the council held at Rome the following
   year and in vain tried to have a reform of the calendar put through. At
   Constance, he took the position that the Pisan council? though it was
   called by the Spirit and represented the Church universal, might have
   erred, as did other councils reputed to be general councils. He
   declared that the three synods of Pisa, Rome and Constance, though not
   one body, yet were virtually one, even as the stream of the Rhine at
   different points is one and the same. It was not necessary, so he held,
   for the Council of Constance to pass acts confirming the Council of
   Pisa, for the two were on a par. [379]

   In the proceedings against John XXIII., the cardinal took sides against
   him. He was the head of the commission which tried Huss in matters of
   faith, June 7, 8, 1415, and was present when the sentence of death was
   passed upon that Reformer. At the close of the council he appears as
   one of the three candidates for the office of pope, and his defeat was
   a disappointment to the French. [380] He was appointed legate by Martin
   V., with his residence at Avignon, and spent his last days there.

   D'Ailly followed Ockam as a nominalist. To his writings in the
   departments of philosophy, theology and Church government he added
   works on astronomy and geography and a much-read commentary on
   Aristotle's meteorology. [381] His work on geography, The Picture of
   the World,--imago mundi,--written 1410, was a favorite book with
   Columbus. A printed copy of it containing marginal notes in the
   navigator's own hand is preserved in the biblioteca Colombina, Seville.
   This copy he probably had with him on his third journey to America,
   for, in writing from Hayti, 1498, he quoted at length the eighth
   chapter. Leaning chiefly upon Roger Bacon, the author represented the
   coast of India or Cathay as stretching far in the direction of Europe,
   so that, in a favorable wind, a ship sailing westwards would reach it
   in a few days. This idea was in the air, but it is possible that it was
   first impressed upon the mind of the discoverer of the New World by the
   reading of D'Ailly's work. Humboldt was the first to show its value for
   the history of discovery. [382]

   § 23. John Gerson, Theologian and Church Leader.

   In John Gerson, 1363-1429, we have the most attractive and the most
   influential theological leader of the first half of the fifteenth
   century. He was intimately identified with the University of Paris as
   professor and as its chancellor in the period of its most extensive
   influence in Europe. His voice carried great weight in the settlement
   of the questions rising out of the papal schism.

   Jean Charlier Gerson, born Dec. 14, 1363, in the village of Gerson, in
   the diocese of Rheims, was the oldest of twelve children. In a letter
   to him still extant, [383] his mother, a godly woman, pours out her
   heart in the prayer that her children may live in unity with each other
   and with God. Two of John's brothers became ecclesiastics. In 1377
   Gerson went to Paris, entering the College of Navarre. This college was
   founded by Johanna, queen of Navarre, 1304, who provided for 3
   departments, the arts with 20 students, philosophy with 30 and theology
   with 20 students. Provision was made also for their support, 4 Paris
   sous weekly for the artists, 6 for the logicians and 8 for the
   theologians. These allowances were to continue until the graduates held
   benefices of the value respectively of 30, 40 and 60 pounds. The
   regulations allowed the theological students a fire, daily, from
   November to March after dinner and supper for one half-hour. The luxury
   of benches was forbidden by a commission appointed by Urban V. in 1366.
   On the festival days, the theologians were expected to deliver a
   collation to their fellow-students of the three classes. The rector at
   the head of the college, originally appointed by the faculty of the
   university, was now appointed by the king's confessor. The students
   wore a special dress and the tonsure, spoke Latin amongst themselves
   and ate in common.

   Gerson, perhaps the most distinguished name the University of Paris has
   on its list of students, was a faithful and enthusiastic son of his
   alma mater, calling her "his mother," "the mother of the light of the
   holy Church," "the nurse of all that is wise and good in Christendom,"
   "a prototype of the heavenly Jerusalem," "the fountain of knowledge,
   the lamp of our faith, the beauty and ornament of France, yea, of the
   whole world." [384]

   In 1382, at the age of nineteen, he passed into the theological
   department, and a year later came under the guidance of D'Ailly, the
   newly appointed rector, remaining under him for seven years. Gerson was
   already a marked man, and was chosen in 1383 procurator of the French
   "nation," and in 1387 one of the delegation to appear before Clement
   VII. and argue the case against John of Montson. This Dominican, who
   had been condemned for denying the immaculate conception of Mary,
   refused to recant on the plea that in being condemned Thomas Aquinas
   was condemned, and he appealed to the pope. The University of Paris
   took up the case, and D'Ailly in two addresses before the papal
   consistory took the ground that Thomas, though a saint, was not
   infallible. The case went against De Montson; and the Dominicans, who
   refused to bow to the decision, left the university and did not return
   till 1403.

   Gerson advocated Mary's exemption from original as well as actual sin,
   and made a distinction between her and Christ, Christ being exempt by
   nature, and Mary--domina nostra -- by an act of divine grace. This
   doctrine, he said, cannot be immediately derived from the Scriptures,
   [385] but, as the Apostles knew more than the prophets, so the Church
   teachers know some things the Apostles did not know.

   At D'Ailly's promotion to the episcopate, 1395, his pupil fell heir to
   both his offices, the offices of professor of theology and chancellor
   of the university. In the discussion over the healing of the schism in
   which the university took the leading part, he occupied a place of
   first prominence, and by tracts, sermons and public memorials directed
   the opinion of the Church in this pressing matter. The premise from
   which he started out was that the peace of the Church is an essential
   condition to the fulfilment of its mission. This view he set forth in a
   famous sermon, preached in 1404 at Tarascon before Benedict XIII. and
   the duke of Orleans. Princes and prelates, he declared, both owe
   obedience to law. The end for which the Church was constituted is the
   peace and well-being of men. All Church authority is established to
   subserve the interests of peace. Peace is so great a boon that all
   should be ready to renounce dignities and position for it. Did not
   Christ suffer shame? Better for a while to be without a pope than that
   the Church should observe the canons and not have peace, for there can
   be salvation where there is no pope. [386] A general council should be
   convened, and it was pious to believe that in the treatment of the
   schism it would not err--pium est credere non erraret. As Schwab has
   said, no one had ever preached in the same way to a pope before. The
   sermon caused a sensation.

   Gerson, though not present at the council of Pisa, contributed to its
   discussions by his important tracts on the Unity of the Church--De
   unitate ecclesiastica-- and the Removal of a Pope--De auferbilitate
   papae ab ecclesia. The views set forth were that Christ is the head of
   the Church, and its monarchical constitution is unchangeable. There
   must be one pope, not several, and the bishops are not equal in
   authority with him. As the pope may separate himself from the Church,
   so the Church may separate itself from the pope. Such action might be
   required by considerations of self-defence. The papal office is of God,
   and yet the pope may be deposed even by a council called without his
   consent. All Church offices and officials exist for the good of the
   Church, that is, for the sake of peace which comes through the exercise
   of love. If a pope has a right to defend himself against, say, the
   charge of unchastity, why should not the Church have a like right to
   defend itself? A council acts under the immediate authority of Christ
   and His laws. The council may pronounce against a pope by virtue of the
   power of the keys which is given not only to one but to the
   body--unitati. Aristotle declared that the body has the right, if
   necessary, to depose its prince. So may the council, and whoso rejects
   a council of the Church rejects God who directs its action. A pope may
   be deposed for heresy and schism, as, for example, if he did not bend
   the knee before the sacrament, and he might be deposed when no personal
   guilt was chargeable against him, as in the case already referred to,
   when he was a captive of the Saracens and was reported dead.

   At the Council of Constance, where Gerson spoke as the delegate of the
   French king, he advocated these positions again and again with his
   voice, as in his address March 23, 1415, and in a second address July
   21, when he defended the decree which the synod had passed at its fifth
   session. He reasserted that the pope may be forced to abdicate, that
   general councils are above the popes and that infallibility only
   belongs to the Church as a body or its highest representative, a
   general council. [387]

   A blot rests upon Gerson's name for the active part he took in the
   condemnation of John Huss. He was not above his age, and using the
   language of Innocent III. called heresy a cancer. [388] He declares
   that he was as zealous in the proceedings against Huss and Wyclif as
   any one could be. [389] He pronounced the nineteen errors drawn from
   Huss' work on the Church "notoriously heretical." Heresy, he declared,
   if it is obstinate, must be destroyed even by the death of its
   professors. [390] He denied Huss' fundamental position that nothing is
   to be accepted as divine truth which is not found in Scripture. Gerson
   also condemned the appeal to conscience, explicitly assuming the old
   position of Church authority and canon law as final. The opinions of an
   individual, however learned he may be in the Scriptures, have no weight
   before the judgment of a council. [391]

   In the controversy over the withdrawal of the cup from the laity,
   involved in the Bohemian heresy, Gerson also took an extreme position,
   defending it by arguments which seem to us altogether unworthy of a
   genuine theology. In a tract on the subject he declared that, though
   some passages of Scripture and of the Fathers favored the distribution
   of both wine and bread, they do not contain a definite command, and in
   the cases where an explicit command is given it must be understood as
   applying to the priests who are obliged to commune under both kinds so
   as to fully represent Christ's sufferings and death. But this is not
   required of the laity who commune for the sake of the effect of
   Christ's death and not to set it forth. Christ commanded only the
   Apostles to partake of both kinds. [392] The custom of lay communion
   was never universal, as is proved by Acts 2:42, 46. The essence of the
   sacrament of the body and blood is more important than the elements,
   John 6:54. But the whole Christ is in either element, and, if some of
   the doctors take a different view, the Church's doctrine is to be
   followed, and not they. From time immemorial the Church has given the
   communion only in one form. The Council of Constance was right in
   deciding that only a single element is necessary to a saving
   participation in the sacrament. The Church may make changes in the
   outward observance when the change does not touch the essence of the
   right in question. The use of the two elements, once profitable, is now
   unprofitable and heretical.

   To these statements Gerson added practical considerations against the
   distribution of the cup to laymen, such as the danger of spilling the
   wine, of soiling the vessels from the long beards of laymen, of having
   the wine turn to vinegar, if it be preserved for the sick and so it
   cease to be the blood of Christ--et ita desineret esse sanguis Christi
   -- and from the impossibility of consecrating in one vessel enough for
   10,000 to 20,000 communicants, as at Easter time may be necessary.
   Another danger was the encouragement such a practice would give to the
   notions that priest and layman are equal, and that the chief value of
   the sacrament lies in the participation and not in the consecration of
   the elements. [393] Such are some of the "scandals" which this renowned
   teacher ascribed to the distribution of the cup to the laity.

   A subject on which Gerson devoted a great deal of energy for many years
   was whether the murder of tyrants or of a traitorous vassal is
   justifiable or not. He advocated the negative side of the case, which
   he failed to win before the Council of Constance. The question grew out
   of the treatment of the half-insane French king, Charles VI.
   (1880-1422), and the attempt of different factions to get control of
   the government.

   On Nov. 28, 1407, the king's cousin, Louis, duke of Orleans, was
   murdered at the command of the king's uncle, John, duke of Burgundy.
   The duke's act was defended by the Franciscan and Paris professor, John
   Petit,--Johannes Parvus,--in an address delivered before the king March
   8, 1408. Gerson, who at an earlier time seems to have advocated the
   murder of tyrants, answered Petit in a public address, and called upon
   the king to suppress Petit's nine propositions. [394] The University of
   Paris made Gerson's cause its own. Petit died in 1411, but the
   controversy went on. Petit's theory was this, that every vassal
   plotting against his lord is deserving of death in soul and body. He is
   a tyrant, and according to the laws of nature and God any one has the
   right to put him out of the way. The higher such a person is in rank,
   the more meritorious is the deed. He based his argument upon Thomas
   Aquinas, John of Salisbury, Aristotle, Cicero and other writers, and
   referred to Moses, Zambri and St. Michael who cast Lucifer out of
   heaven, and other examples. The duke of Orleans was guilty of treason
   against the king, and the duke of Burgundy was justified in killing
   him.

   The bishop of Paris, supported by a commission of the Inquisition and
   at the king's direction, condemned Petit and his views. In February,
   1414, Gerson made a public address defending the condemnation, and two
   days later articles taken from Petit's work were burnt in front of
   Notre Dame. The king ratified the bishop's judgment, and the duke of
   Burgundy appealed the case to Rome. [395]

   The case was now transferred to the council, which at its fifteenth
   session, July 6, 1415, passed a compromise measure condemning the
   doctrine that a tyrant, in the absence of a judicial sentence, may and
   ought to be put to death by any subject whatever, even by the use of
   treacherous means, and in the face of an oath without committing
   perjury. Petit was not mentioned by name. It was this negative and
   timid action, which led Gerson to say that if Huss had had a defender,
   he would not have been found guilty. It was rumored that the commission
   which was appointed to bring in a report, by sixty-one out of eighty
   votes, decided for the permissibility of Petit's articles declaring
   that Peter meant to kill the high priest's servant, and that, if he had
   known Judas' thoughts at the Last Supper, he would have been justified
   in killing him. The duke of Burgundy's gold is said to have been freely
   used. [396] The party led by the bishop of Arras argued that the tyrant
   who takes the sword is to be punished with the sword. Gerson, who was
   supported by D'Ailly replied that then the command "thou shalt not
   kill" would only forbid such an act as murder, if there was coupled
   with it an inspired gloss, "without judicial authority." The command
   means, "thou shalt not kill the innocent, or kill out of revenge."
   Gerson pressed the matter for the last time in an address delivered
   before the council, Jan. 17, 1417, but the council refused to go beyond
   the decree of the fifteenth session.

   The duke of Burgundy got possession of Paris in 1418, and Gerson found
   the doors of France closed to him. Under the protection of the duke of
   Bavaria he found refuge at Rattenberg and later in Austria. On the
   assassination of the duke of Burgundy himself, with the connivance of
   the dauphin, Sept. 10, 1419, he returned to France, but not to Paris.
   He went to Lyons, where his brother John was, and spent his last years
   there in monastic seclusion. The dauphin is said to have granted him
   200 livres in 1420 in recognition of his services to the crown.

   It remains to speak of Gerson as a theologian, a preacher and a
   patriot.

   In the department of theology proper Gerson has a place among the
   mystics. [397] Mysticism he defines as "the art of love," the
   "perception of God through experience." Such experience is reached by
   humility and penance more than through the path of speculation. The
   contemplative life is most desirable, but, following Christ's example,
   contemplation must be combined with action. The contemplation of God
   consists of knowledge as taught in John 17:3, "This is life eternal, to
   know Thee and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent." Such knowledge is
   mingled with love. The soul is one with God through love. His mysticism
   was based, on the one hand, on the study of the Scriptures and, on the
   other, on the study of Bonaventura and the St. Victors. He wrote a
   special treatise in praise of Bonaventura and his mystical writings.
   Far from having any conscious affinity with the German mystics, he
   wrote against John of Ruysbroeck and Ruysbroeck's pupil, John of
   Schönhofen, charging them with pantheism.

   While Gerson emphasized the religious feelings, he was far from being a
   religious visionary and wrote treatises against the dangers of delusion
   from dreams and revelations. As coins must be tested by their weight,
   hardness, color, shape and stamp, so visions are to be tested by the
   humility and honesty of those who profess to have them and their
   readiness to teach and be taught. He commended the monk who, when some
   one offered to show him a figure like Christ, replied, "I do not want
   to see Christ on the earth. I am contented to wait till I see him in
   heaven."

   When the negotiations were going on at the Council of Constance for the
   confirmation of the canonization of St. Brigitta, Gerson laid down the
   principle that, if visions reveal what is already in the Scriptures,
   [398] then they are false, for God does not repeat Himself, Job 33:14.
   People have itching ears for revelations because they do not study the
   Bible. Later he warned [399] against the revelations of women, as women
   are more open to deception than men.

   The Scriptures, Gerson taught, are the Church's rule and guide to the
   end of the world. If a single statement should be proved false, then
   the whole volume is false, for the Holy Spirit is author of the whole.
   The letter of the text, however, is not sufficient to determine their
   meaning, as is proved from the translations of the Waldenses, Beghards
   and other secretaries. [400] The text needs the authority of the
   Church, as Augustine indicated when he said, "I would not believe the
   Gospel if the authority of the Church did not compel me."

   Great as Gerson's services were in other departments, it was, to follow
   his sympathetic and scholarly biographer, Schwab, from the pulpit that
   he exercised most influence on his generation. [401] He preached in
   French as well as Latin, and his sermons had, for the most part, a
   practical intent, being occupied with ethical themes such as pride,
   idleness, anger, the commandments of the Decalogue, the marital state.
   He held that the ordinary priest should confine himself to a simple
   explanation of the Decalogue, the greater sins and the articles of
   faith.

   During the last ten years of his life, spent in seclusion at Lyons, he
   continued his literary activity, writing more particularly in the vein
   of mystical theology. His last work was on the Canticles.

   The tradition runs that the great teacher in his last years conducted a
   catechetical school for children in St. Paul's at Lyons, and that he
   taught them to offer for himself the daily prayer, "God, my creator,
   have pity upon Thy poor servant, Jean Gerson"--Mon Dieu, mon Createur,
   ayez pitié de vostre pauvre serviteur, Jean Gerson. [402] It was for
   young boys and perhaps for boys spending their first years in the
   university that he wrote his tractate entitled Leading Children to
   Christ. [403] It opens with an exposition of the words, "Suffer little
   children to come unto me" and proceeds to show how much more seemly it
   is to offer to God our best in youth than the dregs of sickly old age.
   The author takes up the sins children should be admonished to avoid,
   especially unchastity, and holds up to reprobation the principle that
   vice is venial if it is kept secret, the principle expressed in the
   words si non caste tamen caute.

   In a threefold work, giving a brief exposition of the Ten Commandments,
   a statement of the seven mortal sins and some short meditations on
   death and the way to meet it, Gerson gives a sort of catechism,
   although it is not thrown into the form of questions and answers. As
   the author states, it was intended for the benefit of poorly instructed
   curates who heard confessions, for parents who had children to
   instruct, for persons not interested in the public services of worship
   and for those who had the care of the sick in hospitals. [404]

   The title, most Christian doctor--doctor christianissimus -- given to
   John Gerson is intended to emphasize the evangelical temper of his
   teaching. To a clear intellect, he added warm religious fervor. With a
   love for the Church, which it would be hard to find excelled, he
   magnified the body of Christian people as possessing the mind and
   immediate guidance of Christ and threw himself into the advocacy of the
   principle that the judgment of Christendom, as expressed in a general
   council, is the final authority of religious matters on the earth.

   He opposed some of the superstitions inherited from another time. He
   emphasized the authority of the sacred text. In these views as in
   others he was in sympathy with the progressive spirit of his age. But
   he stopped short of the principles of the Reformers. He knew nothing of
   the principles of individual sovereignty and the rights of conscience.
   His thinking moved along churchly lines. He had none of the bold
   original thought of Wyclif and little of that spirit which sets itself
   against the current errors of the times in which we live. His vote for
   Huss' burning proves sufficiently that the light of the new age had not
   dawned upon his mind. He was not, like them, a forerunner of the
   movement of the sixteenth century.

   The chief principle for which Gerson contended, the supremacy of
   general councils, met with defeat soon after the great chancellor's
   death, and was set aside by popes and later by the judgment of a
   general council. His writings, however, which were frequently published
   remain the chief literary monuments in the department of theology of
   the first half of the fourteenth century. [405] Separated from the
   Schoolmen in spirit and method, he stands almost in a class by himself,
   the most eminent theologian of his century. This judgment is an
   extension of the judgment of the eminent German abbot and writer,
   Trithemius, at the close of the fifteenth century: "He was by far the
   chief divine of his age" [406] Theologorum sui temporis longe princeps.

   § 24. Nicolas of Clamanges, the Moralist.

   The third of the great luminaries who gave fame to the University of
   Paris in this period, Nicolas Poillevillain de Clamanges, was born at
   Clamengis, [407] Champagne, about 1367 and died in Paris about 1437.
   Shy by nature, he took a less prominent part in the settlement of the
   great questions of the age than his contemporaries, D'Ailly and Gerson.
   Like them, he was identified with the discussions called forth by the
   schism, and is distinguished for the high value he put on the study of
   the Scriptures and his sharp exposition of the corruption of the
   clergy. He entered the College of Navarre at twelve, and had D'Ailly
   and Gerson for his teachers. In theology he did not go beyond the
   baccalaureate. It is probable he was chosen rector of the university
   1393. With Peter of Monsterolio, he was the chief classical scholar of
   the university and was able to write that in Paris, Virgil, Terence and
   Cicero were often read in public and in private. [408]

   In 1394, Clamanges took a prominent part in preparing the paper,
   setting forth the conclusions of the university in regard to the
   healing of the schism. [409] It was addressed to the "most Christian
   king, Charles VI., most zealous of religious orthodoxy by his daughter,
   the university." This, the famous document suggesting the three ways of
   healing the schism,--by abdication, arbitration and by a general
   council,--is characterized by firmness and moderation, two of the
   elements prominent in Clamanges' character. It pronounced the schism
   pestiferous, and in answer to the question who would give the council
   its authority, it answered: "The communion of all the faithful will
   give it; Christ will give it, who said: 'Where two or three are
   gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them.' "

   The Paris professor was one of the men whom the keen-eyed Peter de Luna
   picked out, and when he was elected pope, Clamanges supported him and
   wrote appealing to him, as the one who no longer occupied the position
   of one boatman among others, but stood at the rudder of the ship, to
   act in the interest of all Christendom. He was called as secretary to
   the Avignon court, but became weary of the commotion and the vices of
   the palace and the town. [410] In 1406, he seems to have withdrawn from
   Benedict at Genoa and retired to Langres, where he held a canon's
   stall. He did not, however, break with the pope, and, when Benedict in
   1408 issued the bull threatening the French court with excommunication,
   Clamanges was charged with being its author. He denied the charge, but
   the accusation of want of patriotism had made a strong impression, and
   he withdrew to the Carthusian convent, Valprofonds, and later to
   Fontaine du Bosc. His seclusion he employed in writing letters and
   treatises and in the study of the Bible which he now expressed regret
   for having neglected in former years for classical studies.

   To D'Ailly he wrote on the advantages of a secluded life.--De fructu
   eremi. In another tract--De fructu rerum adversarum -- he presented the
   advantages of adversity. One of more importance complained of the abuse
   of the Lord's Day and of the multiplication of festivals as taking the
   workman from his work while the interests of piety were not advanced.
   In still another tract--De studio theologico -- addressed to a
   theologian at Paris who had inquired whether it was better for him to
   continue where he was or to retire to a pastorate, he emphasized the
   importance and delicacy of caring for souls, but advised the inquirer
   to remain at the university and to concern himself chiefly with the
   study of the Scriptures. He ascribed the Church's decline to their
   neglect, and pronounced the mass, processionals and festivals as of no
   account unless the heart be purified by faith.

   During the sessions of the Council of Constance, which he did not
   attend, Clamanges sent a letter to that body urging unity of thought
   and action. He expressed doubt whether general councils were always led
   by the Holy Spirit. The Church, which he defined as infallible, is only
   there where the Holy Spirit is, and where the Church is, can be only
   known to God Himself. In 1425 he returned to Paris and lectured on
   rhetoric and theology.

   Clamanges' reputation rests chiefly upon his sharp criticism of the
   corrupt morals of the clergy. His residence in Avignon gave him a good
   opportunity for observation. His tract on the prelates who were
   practising simony--De praesulibus simoniacis -- is a commentary on the
   words, "But ye have made it a den of thieves," Matt. 21:13. A second
   tract on the downfall of the Church--De ruina ecclesiae -- is one of
   the most noted writings of the age. Here are set forth the simony and
   private vices practised at Avignon where all things holy were
   prostituted for gold and luxury. Here is described the corruption of
   the clergy from the pope down to the lowest class of priests. The
   author found ideal conditions in the first century, when the minds of
   the clergy were wholly set on heavenly things. With possessions and
   power came avarice and ambition, pride and luxury. The popes themselves
   were guilty of pride in exalting their authority above that of the
   empire and by asserting for themselves the right of appointing all
   prelates, yea of filling all the benefices of Christendom. The evils
   arising from annates and expectances surpass the power of statement.
   The cardinals followed the popes in their greed and pride, single
   cardinals having as many as 500 livings. In order to perpetuate their
   "tyranny," pope and curia had entered into league with princes, which
   Clamanges pronounces an abominable fornication. Many of the bishops
   drew large incomes from their sees which they administered through
   others, never visiting them themselves. Canons and vicars followed the
   same course and divided their time between idleness and sensual
   pleasure. The mendicant monks corresponded to the Pharisees of the
   synagogue. Scarcely one cleric out of a thousand did what his
   profession demanded. They were steeped in ignorance and given to
   brawling, drinking, playing with dice and fornication. Priests bought
   the privilege of keeping concubines. As for the nuns, Clamanges said,
   he dared not speak of them. Nunneries were not the sanctuaries of God,
   but shameful brothels of Venus, resorts of unchaste and wanton youth
   for the sating of their passions, and for a girl to put on the veil was
   virtually to submit herself to prostitution. [411] The Church was
   drunken with the lust of power, glory and pleasures. Judgment was sure
   to come, and men should bow humbly before God who alone could rectify
   the evils and put an end to the schism. Descriptions such as these must
   be used with discrimination, and it would be wrong to deduce from them
   that the entire clerical body was corrupt. The diseases, however, must
   have been deep-seated to call forth such a lament from a man of
   Clamanges' position.

   The author did not call to open battle like the German Reformer at a
   later time, but suggested as a remedy prayers, processions and fasts.
   His watchword was that the Church must humble itself before it can be
   rebuilt. [412] It was, however, a bold utterance and forms an important
   part of that body of literature which so powerfully moulded opinion at
   the time of the Reformatory councils.

   The loud complaints against the state of morals at the papal court and
   beyond during the Avignon period increased, if possible, in strength
   during the time of the schism. The list of abuses to be corrected which
   the Council of Constance issued, Oct. 30, 1417, includes the official
   offences of the curia, such as reservations, annates, the sale of
   indulgences and the unrestricted right of appeals to the papal court.
   The subject of chastity it remained for individual writers to press. In
   describing the third Babylon, Petrarch was even more severe than
   Clamanges who wrote of conditions as they existed nearly a century
   later and accused the papal household of practising adultery, rape and
   all manners of fornication. [413] ois, La vie en France au moyen âge
   d'après quelques moralistes du temps, Paris, 1908, pp. 320, 336, etc.
   Clamanges declared that many parishes insisted upon the priests keeping
   concubines as a precaution in defence of their own families. Against
   all canonical rules John XXIII. gave a dispensation to the illegitimate
   son of Henry IV. of England, who was only ten years old, to enter
   orders. [414] The case of John XXIII. was an extreme one, but it must
   be remembered, that in Bologna where he was sent as cardinal-legate,
   his biographer, Dietrich of Nieheim, says that two hundred matrons and
   maidens, including some nuns, fell victims to the future pontiff's
   amours. Dietrich Vrie in his History of the Council of Constance said:
   "The supreme pontiffs, as I know, are elected through avarice and
   simony and likewise the other bishops are ordained for gold. The old
   proverb; 'Freely give, for freely ye have received' is now most vilely
   perverted and runs 'Freely I have not received and freely I will not
   give, for I have bought my bishopric with a great price and must
   indemnify myself impiously for my outlay.' ... If Simon Magus were now
   alive he might buy with money not only the Holy Ghost but God the
   Father and Me, God the Son." [415] But bad as was the moral condition
   of the hierarchy and papacy at the time of the schism, it was not so
   bad as during the last half century of the Middle Ages. The Reformatory
   councils are the best, though by no means the only, proof that a deep
   moral vitality existed in the Church. Their very summons and assembling
   were a protest against clerical corruption and hypocrisy "in head and
   members,"--from the pope down to the most obscure priest,--and at the
   same time a most hopeful sign of future betterment.

   § 25. Nicolas of Cusa, Scholar and Churchman.

   Of the theologians of the generation following Gerson and D'Ailly none
   occupies a more conspicuous place than the German Nicolas of Cusa,
   1401-1464. After taking a prominent part in the Basel council in its
   earlier history, he went into the service of Eugenius IV. and
   distinguished himself by practical efforts at Church reform and by
   writings in theology and other departments of human learning.

   Born at Cues near Treves, the son of a boatman, he left the parental
   home on account of harsh treatment. Coming under the patronage of the
   count of Manderscheid, he went to Deventer, where he received training
   in the school conducted by the Brothers of the Common Life. He studied
   law in Padua, and reached the doctorate, but exchanged law for theology
   because, to follow the statement of his opponent, George of Heimburg,
   he had failed in his first case. At Padua he had for one of his
   teachers Cesarini, afterwards cardinal and a prominent figure in the
   Council of Basel.

   In 1432 he appeared in Basel as the representative of Ulrich of
   Manderscheid, archbishop-elect of Treves, to advocate Ulrich's cause
   against his rivals Rabanus of Helmstatt, bishop of Spires, whom the
   pope had appointed archbishop of the Treves diocese. Identifying
   himself closely with the conciliar body, Nicolas had a leading part in
   the proceedings with the Hussites and went with the majority in
   advocating the superiority of the council over the pope. His work on
   Catholic Unity,--De concordantia catholica,--embodying his views on
   this question and dedicated to the council 1433, followed the earlier
   treatments of Langenstein, Nieheim and Gerson. A general council, being
   inspired by the Holy Spirit, speaks truly and infallibly. The Church is
   the body of the faithful--unitas fidelium -- and is represented in a
   general council. The pope derives his authority from the consent of the
   Church, a council has power to dethrone him for heresy and other causes
   and may not be prorogued or adjourned without its own consent. Peter
   received no more authority from Christ than the other Apostles.
   Whatever was said to Peter was likewise said to the others. All bishops
   are of equal authority and dignity, whether their jurisdiction be
   episcopal, archiepiscopal, patriarchal or papal, just as all presbyters
   are equal. [416]

   In spite of these views, when the question arose as to the place of
   meeting the Greeks, Nicolas sided with the minority in favor of an
   Italian city, and was a member of the delegations appointed by the
   minority which visited Eugenius IV. at Bologna and went to
   Constantinople. This was in 1437 and from that time forward he was a
   ready servant of Eugenius and his two successors. Aeneas Sylvius,
   afterwards Pius II., called him the Hercules of the Eugenians. Aeneas
   also pronounced him a man notable for learning in all branches of
   knowledge and on account of his godly life. [417]

   Eugenius employed his new supporter as legate to arrange terms of peace
   with the German Church and princes, an end he saw accomplished in the
   concordat of Vienna, 1447. He was rewarded by promotion to the college
   of cardinals, and in 1452 was made bishop of Brixen in the Tyrol. Here
   he sought to introduce Church reforms, and he travelled as the papal
   legate in the same interest throughout the larger part of Germany.

   By attempting to assert all the mediaeval feoffal rights of his
   diocese, the bishop came into sharp conflict with Siegmund, duke of
   Austria. Even the interdict pronounced by two popes did not bring the
   duke to terms. He declared war against the bishop and, taking him
   prisoner, forced from him a promise to renounce the old rights which
   his predecessors for many years had not asserted. Once released, the
   bishop treated his oath as null, on the ground that it had been forced
   from him, and in this he was supported by Pius II. In 1460 he went to
   Rome and died at Todi, Umbria, a few years later.

   Nicolas of Cusa knew Greek and Hebrew, and perhaps has claim to being
   the most universal scholar of Germany up to his day since Albertus
   Magnus. He was interested in astronomy, mathematics and botany, and, as
   D'Ailly had done before, he urged, at the Council of Basel, the
   correction of the calendar. The literary production on which he spent
   most labor was a discussion of the problems of theology--De docta
   ignorantia. Here he attacked the scholastic method and showed the
   influence upon his mind of mysticism, the atmosphere of which he
   breathed at Deventer. He laid stress upon the limitations of the human
   mind and the inability of the reason to find out God exhaustively.
   Faith, which he defined as a state of the soul given of God's grace,
   finds out truths the intellect cannot attain to. [418] His views had an
   influence upon Faber Stapulensis who edited the Cusan's works and was
   himself a French forerunner of Luther in the doctrine of justification
   by faith.

   His last labors, in connection with the crusade against the Turks
   pushed by Pius II., led him to studies in the Koran and the preparation
   of a tract,--De cribatione Alcoran,--in which he declared that false
   religions have the true religion as their basis.

   It is as an ecclesiastical mediator, and as a reformer of clerical and
   conventual abuses that the cardinal has his chief place in history. He
   preached in the vernacular. In Bamberg he secured the prohibition of
   new brotherhoods, in Magdeburg the condemnation of the sale of
   indulgences for money. In Salzburg and other places he introduced
   reforms in convents, and in connection with other members of his family
   he founded the hospital at Cues with beds for 33 patients. He showed
   his interest in studies by providing for the training of 20 boys in
   Deventer. He dwelt upon the rotation of the earth on its axis nearly a
   century before Copernicus. He gave reasons for regarding the donation
   of Constantine spurious, and he also called in question the genuineness
   of other parts of the Isidorian Decretals.

   On the other hand, the cardinal was a thorough churchman and obedient
   child of the Church. As the agent of Nicolas V. he travelled in Germany
   announcing the indulgence of the Jubilee Year, and through him, it is
   said, indulgences to the value of 200,000 gulden were sold for the
   repair of St. Peter's.

   This noble and many-sided man has been coupled together with Gutenberg
   by Janssen,--the able and learned apologist of the Catholic Church in
   the closing years of the Middle Ages,--the one as the champion of
   clerical and Church discipline, the other the inventor of the
   printing-press. It is no disparagement of the impulses and work of
   Nicolas to say that he had not the mission of the herald of a new age
   in thought and religion as it was given to Gutenberg to promote culture
   and civilization by his invention. [419] He did not possess the gift of
   moral and doctrinal conviction and foresight which made the monk of
   Wittenberg the exponent and the herald of a radical, religious
   reformation whose permanent benefits are borne witness to by a large
   section of Christendom.

   [416] John of Turrecremata, d. 1468, whose tract on the seat of
   authority in the Church--Summa de Eccles. et ejus auctoritate --1450
   has already been referred to, took the extreme ultramontane position.
   The papal supremacy extends to all Christians throughout the world and
   includes the appointment of all bishops and right to depose them, the
   filling of all prelatures and benefices whatsoever and the canonizing
   of saints. As the vicar of Christ, he has full jurisdiction in all the
   earth in temporal as well as spiritual matters because all jurisdiction
   of secular princes is derived from the pope quod omnium principum
   saecularum jurisdictionalis potestas a papa in eos derivata sit. Quoted

   [419] Janssen, I. 2-6. Here we come for the first time into contact
   with this author whose work has gone through 20 editions and made such
   a remarkable sensation. Its conclusions and methods of treatment will
   be referred to at length farther on. Here it is sufficient to call
   attention to the seductive plausibility of the work, whose purpose it
   is to show that an orderly reformation was going on in the Church in
   Germany when Luther appeared and by his revolutionary and immoral
   tendency brutally rived the unity of the Church and checked the orderly
   reformation. Such a conclusion is a result of the manipulation of
   historic materials and the use of superlatives in describing men and
   influences which were like rills in the history of the onward progress
   of religion and civilization. The initial comparison between Gutenberg
   and Nicolas of Cusa begs the whole conclusion which Janssen had in view
   in writing his work. Of the permanent consequence of the work of the
   inventor of the printing-press, no one has any doubt. The author makes
   a great jump when he asserts a like permanent influence for Nicolas in
   the department of religion.

   § 26. Popular Preachers.

   During the century and a half closing with 1450, there were local
   groups of preachers as well as isolated pulpit orators who exercised a
   deep influence upon congregations. The German mystics with Eckart and
   John Tauler at their head preached in Strassburg, Cologne and along the
   Rhine. D'Ailly and Gerson stood before select audiences, and give
   lustre to the French pulpit. Wyclif, at Oxford, and John Huss in
   Bohemia, attracted great attention by their sermons and brought down
   upon themselves ecclesiastical condemnation. Huss was one of a number
   of Bohemian preachers of eminence. Wyclif sought to promote preaching
   by sending out a special class of men, his "pore preachers."

   The popular preachers constitute another group, though the period does
   not furnish one who can be brought into comparison with the
   field-preacher, Berthold of Regensburg, the Whitefield of his century,
   d. 1272. Among the popular preachers of the time the most famous were
   Bernardino and John of Capistrano, both Italians, and members of the
   Observant wing of the Franciscan order, and the Spanish Dominican,
   Vincent Ferrer. To a later age belong those bright pulpit luminaries,
   Savonarola of Florence and Geiler of Strassburg.

   Bernardino of Siena, 1380-1444, was praised by Pius II. as a second
   Paul. He made a marked impression upon Italian audiences and was a
   favorite with pope Martin V. His voice, weak and indistinct at first,
   was said to have been made strong and clear through the grace of Mary,
   to whom he turned for help. He was the first vicar-general of the
   Observants, who numbered only a few congregations in Italy when he
   joined them, but increased greatly under his administration. In 1424 he
   was in Rome and, as Infessura the Roman diarist reports, [420] so
   influenced the people that they brought their games and articles of
   adornment to the Capitol and made a bonfire of them. Wherever he went
   to preach, a banner was carried before him containing the monogram of
   Christ, IHS, with twelve rays centring in the letters. He urged priests
   to put the monogram on the walls of churches and public buildings, and
   such a monogram may still be seen on the city building of Siena. [421]
   The Augustinians and Dominicans and also Poggio attacked him for this
   practice. In 1427, he appeared in Rome to answer the charges. He was
   acquitted by Martin V., who gave him permission to preach everywhere,
   and instructed him to hold an eighty-days' mission in the papal city
   itself. In 1419, he appeared in the Lombard cities, where the people
   were carried away by his exhortations to repentance, and often burned
   their trinkets and games in the public squares. His body lies in
   Aquila, and he was canonized by Nicolas V., 1450.

   John of Capistrano, 1386-1456, a lawyer, and at an early age intrusted
   with the administration of Perugia, joined the Observants in 1416 and
   became a pupil of Bernardino. He made a reputation as an inquisitor in
   Northern Italy, converting and burning heretics and Jews. No one could
   have excelled him in the ferocity of his zeal against heresy. His first
   appointment as inquisitor was made in 1426, and his fourth appointment
   23 years later in 1449. [422]

   As a leader of his order, he defended Bernardino in 1427, and was made
   vicar-general in 1443. He extended his preaching to Vienna and far up
   into Germany, from Nürnberg to Dresden, Leipzig, Magdeburg and Breslau,
   making everywhere a tremendous sensation. He used the Latin or Italian,
   which had to be interpreted to his audiences. These are reported to
   have numbered as many as thirty thousand. [423] He carried relics of
   Bernardino with him, and through them and his own instrumentality many
   miracles were said to have been performed. His attendants made a note
   of the wonderful works on the spot. [424] The spell of his preaching
   was shown by the burning of pointed shoes, games of cards, dice and
   other articles of pleasure or vanity. Thousands of heretics are also
   reported to have yielded to his persuasions. He was called by Pius II.
   to preach against the Hussites, and later against the Turks. He was
   present at the siege of Belgrade, and contributed to the successful
   defence of the city and the defeat of Mohammed II. He was canonized in
   1690.

   The life of Vincent Ferrer, d. 1419, the greatest of Spanish preachers,
   fell during the period of the papal schism, and he was intimately
   identified with the controversies it called forth. His name is also
   associated with the gift of tongues and with the sect of the
   Flagellants. This devoted missionary, born in Valencia, joined the
   Dominican order, and pursued his studies in the universities of
   Barcelona and Lerida. He won the doctorate of theology by his tract on
   the Modern Schism in the Church--De moderno ecclesiae schismate.
   Returning to Valencia, he gained fame as a preacher, and was appointed
   confessor to the queen of Aragon, Iolanthe, and counsellor to her
   husband, John I. In 1395, Benedict XIII. called him to be chief
   penitentiary in Avignon and master of the papal palace. Two years later
   he returned to Valencia with the title of papal legate. He at first
   defended the Avignon obedience with great warmth, but later, persuaded
   that Benedict was not sincere in his professions looking to the healing
   of the schism, withdrew from him his support and supported the Council
   of Constance.

   Ferrer's apostolic labors began in 1399. He itinerated through Spain,
   Northern Italy and France, preaching two and three times a day on the
   great themes of repentance and the nearness of the judgment. He has the
   reputation of being the most successful of missionaries among the Jews
   and Mohammedans. Twenty-five thousand Jews and eight thousand
   Mohammedans are said to have yielded to his persuasions. Able to speak
   only Spanish, his sermons, though they were not interpreted, are
   reported to have been understood in France and Italy. The gift of
   tongues was ascribed to him by his contemporaries as well as the gift
   of miracles. Priests and singers accompanied him on his tours, and some
   of the hymns sung were Vincent's own compositions. His audiences are
   given as high as 70,000, an incredible number, and he is said to have
   preached twenty thousand times. He also preached to the Waldenses in
   their valleys and to the remnant of the Cathari, and is said to have
   made numerous converts. He himself was not above the suspicion of
   heresy, and Eymerich made the charge against him of declaring that
   Judas Iscariot hanged himself because the people would not permit him
   to live, and that he found pardon with God. [425] He was canonized by
   Calixtus III., 1455. The tale is that Ferrer noticed this member of the
   Borgia family as a young priest in Valencia, and made the prediction
   that one day he would reach the highest office open to mortal man.
   [426]

   On his itineraries Ferrer was also accompanied by bands of Flagellants.
   He himself joined in the flagellations, and the scourge with which he
   scourged himself daily, consisting of six thongs, is said still to be
   preserved in the Carthusian convent of Catalonia, scala coeli. Both
   Gerson and D'Ailly attacked Ferrer for his adoption of the Flagellant
   delusion. In a letter addressed to the Spanish preacher, written during
   the sessions of the Council of Constance, Gerson took the ground that
   both the Old Testament and the New Testament forbid violence done to

   Note.--Eckart's German sermons and tracts, published in 1498 and 1521,
   were his only writings known to exist till Pfeiffer's ed., 1867.
   Denifle was the first to discover Eckart's Latin writings, in the
   convent of Erfurt, 1880, and at Cusa on the Mosel, 1886. These are
   fragments on Genesis, Exodus, Ecclesiastes and the Book of Wisdom. John
   Trithemius, in his De Scripp. Eccles., 1492, gives a list of Eckart's
   writings which indicates a literary activity extending beyond the works
   we possess. The list catalogues four books on the Sentences,
   commentaries on Genesis, Exodus, the Canticles, the Book of Wisdom, St.
   John, on the Lord's Prayer, etc.

   Poverty, ed. by Denifle, Munich, 1877, and previously under the title
   Imitation of Christ's Life of Poverty, by D. Sudermann, Frankfurt,
   1621, etc. Denifle pointed out the discord between its teachings and
   the teachings of Tauler's sermons. (2) Medulla animae, consisting of 77
   chapters. Preger decides some of them to be genuine. (3) Certain hymns,
   including Es kommt ein Schiff geladen, which even Preger pronounces
   spurious, III. 86. They are publ. by Wackernagel.

   Note.--A few of the short writings of Groote were preserved by Thomas à
   Kempis. To the sermons edited by Acquoy, Langenberg, pp. 3-33, has
   added Groote's tract on simony, which he found in the convent of
   Frenswegen, near Nordhorn. He has also found Groote's Latin writings.
   The tract on simony--de simonia ad Beguttas -- is addressed to the
   Beguines in answer to the question propounded to him by some of their
   number as to whether it was simony to purchase a place in a Beguine
   convent. The author says that simony "prevails very much everywhere,"
   and that it was not punished by the Church. He declares it to be simony
   to purchase a place which involves spiritual exercises, and he goes on
   to apply the principle to civil offices pronouncing it simony when they
   are bought for money. The work is written in Low German, heavy in
   style, but interesting for the light it throws on practices current at
   that time.

   § 28. The New Mysticism.


   In joy of inward peace, or sense

   Of sorrow over sin,

   He is his own best evidence

   His witness is within.

   --Whittier, Our Master.

   At the time when the scholastic method was falling into disrepute and
   the scandals of the Avignon court and the papal schism were shaking
   men's faith in the foundations of the Church, a stream of pure pietism
   was watering the regions along the Rhine, from Basel to Cologne, and
   from Cologne to the North Sea. North of the Alps, voices issuing from
   convents and from the ranks of the laity called attention to the value
   of the inner religious life and God's immediate communications to the
   soul.

   To this religious movement has recently been given the name, the
   Dominican mysticism, on account of the large number of its
   representatives who belonged to the Dominican order. The older name,
   German mysticism, which is to be preferred, points to the locality
   where it manifested itself, and to the language which the mystics for
   the most part used in their writings. Like the Protestant Reformation,
   the movement had its origin on German soil, but, unlike the
   Reformation, it did not spread beyond Germany and the Lowlands. Its
   chief centres were Strassburg and Cologne; its leading representatives
   the speculative Meister Eckart, d. 1327, John Tauler, d. 136l, Henry
   Suso, d. 1366, John Ruysbroeck, d. 1381, Gerrit Groote, d. 1384, and
   Thomas à Kempis, d. 1471. The earlier designation for these pietists
   was Friends of God. The Brothers of the Common Life, the companions and
   followers of Groote, were of the same type, but developed abiding
   institutions of practical Christian philanthropy. In localities the
   Beguines and Beghards also breathed the same devotional and
   philanthropic spirit. The little book called the German Theology, and
   the Imitation of Christ, were among the finest fruits of the movement.
   Gerson and Nicolas of Cusa also had a strong mystical vein, but they
   are not to be classed with the German mystics. With them mysticism was
   an incidental, not the distinguishing, quality.

   The mystics along the Rhine formed groups which, however, were not
   bound together by any formal organization. Their only bond was the
   fellowship of a common religious purpose.

   Their religious thought was not always homogeneous in its expression,
   but all agreed in the serious attempt to secure purity of heart and
   life through union of the soul with God. Mysticism is a phase of
   Christian life. It is a devotional habit, in contradistinction to the
   outward and formal practice of religious rules. It is a religious
   experience in contrast to a mere intellectual assent to tenets. It is
   the conscious effort of the soul to apprehend and possess God and
   Christ, and expresses itself in the words, "I live, and yet not I but
   Christ liveth in me." It is essentially what is now called in some
   quarters "personal religion." Perhaps the shortest definition of
   mysticism is the best. It is the love of God shed abroad in the heart.
   [428] The element of intuition has a large place, and the avenues
   through which religious experience is reached are self-detachment from
   the world, self-purgation, prayer and contemplation.

   Without disparaging the sacraments or disputing the authority of the
   Church, the German mystics sought a better way. They laid stress upon
   the meaning of such passages as "he that believeth in me shall never
   hunger and he that cometh unto me shall never thirst, " "he that loveth
   me shall be loved of my Father "and "he that followeth me shall not
   walk in darkness." The word love figures most prominently in their
   writings. Among the distinctive terms in vogue among them were
   Abgeschiedenheit, Eckart's word for self-detachment from the world and
   that which is temporal, and Kehr, Tauler's oft-used word for
   conversion. They laid stress upon the new birth, and found in Christ's
   incarnation a type of the realization of the divine in the soul.

   German mysticism had a distinct individuality of its own. On occasion,
   its leaders quoted Augustine's Confessions and other works, Dionysius
   the Areopagite, Bernard and Thomas Aquinas, but they did not have the
   habit of referring back to human authorities as had the Schoolmen,
   bulwarking every theological statement by patristic quotations, or
   statements taken from Aristotle. The movement arose like a root out of
   a dry ground at a time of great corruption and distraction in the
   Church, and it arose where it might have been least expected to arise.
   Its field was the territory along the Rhine where the heretical sects
   had had representation. It was a fresh outburst of piety, an earnest
   seeking after God by other paths than the religious externalism
   fostered by sacerdotal prescriptions and scholastic dialectics. The
   mystics led the people back from the clangor and tinkling of
   ecclesiastical symbolisms to the refreshing springs of water which
   spring up into everlasting life.

   Compared with the mysticism of the earlier Middle Ages and the French
   quietism of the seventeenth century, represented by Madame Guyon,
   Fénelon and their predecessor the Spaniard Miguel de Molinos, German
   mysticism likewise has its own distinctive features. The religion of
   Bernard expressed itself in passionate and rapturous love for Jesus.
   Madame Guyon and Fénelon set up as the goal of religion a state of
   disinterested love, which was to be reached chiefly by prayer, an end
   which Bernard felt it scarcely possible to reach in this world.

   The mystics along the Rhine agreed with all genuine mystics in striving
   after the direct union of the soul with God. They sought, as did
   Eckart, the loss of our being in the ocean of the Godhead, or with
   Tauler the undisturbed peace of the soul, or with Ruysbroeck the impact
   of the divine nature upon our nature at its innermost point, kindling
   with divine love as fire kindles. With this aspiration after the
   complete apprehension of God, they combined a practical tendency. Their
   silent devotion and meditation were not final exercises. They were
   moved by warm human sympathies, and looked with almost reverential
   regard upon the usual pursuits and toil of men. They approached close
   to the idea that in the faithful devotion to daily tasks man may
   realize the highest type of religious experience.

   By preaching, by writing and circulating devotional works, and
   especially by their own examples, they made known the secret and the
   peace of the inner life. In the regions along the lower Rhine, the
   movement manifested itself also in the care of the sick, and notably in
   schools for the education of the young. These schools proved to be
   preparatory for the German Reformation by training a body of men of
   wider outlook and larger sympathies than the mediaeval convent was
   adapted to rear.

   For the understanding of the spirit and meaning of German mysticism, no
   help is so close at hand as the comparison between it and mediaeval
   scholasticism. This religious movement was the antithesis of the
   theology of the Schoolmen; Eckart and Tauler of Thomas Aquinas, the
   German Theology of the endless argumentation of Duns Scotus, the
   Imitation of Christ of the cumbersome exhaustiveness of Albertus
   Magnus. Roger Bacon had felt revulsion from the hairsplitting
   casuistries of the Schoolmen, and given expression to it before Eckart
   began his activity at Cologne. Scholasticism had trodden a beaten and
   dusty highway. The German mystics walked in secluded and shady
   pathways. For a catalogue of dogmatic maxims they substituted the quiet
   expressions of filial devotion and assurance. The speculative element
   is still prominent in Eckart, but it is not indulged for the sake of
   establishing doctrinal rectitude, but for the nurture of inward
   experience of God's operations in the soul. Godliness with these men
   was not a system of careful definitions, it was a state of spiritual
   communion; not an elaborate construction of speculative thought, but a
   simple faith and walk with God. Not processes of logic but the insight
   of devotion was their guide. [429] As Loofs has well said, German
   mysticism emphasized above all dogmas and all external works the
   necessity of the new birth. [430] It also had its dangers. Socrates had
   urged men not to rest hopes upon the Delphian oracle, but to listen to
   the voice in their own bosoms. The mystics, in seeking to hear the
   voice of God speaking in their own hearts, ran peril of magnifying
   individualism to the disparagement of what was common to all and of
   mistaking states of the overwrought imagination for revelations from
   God. [431]

   Although the German mystical writers have not been quoted in the acts
   of councils or by popes as have been the theologies of the Schoolmen,
   they represented, if we follow the testimonies of Luther and
   Melanchthon, an important stage in the religious development of the
   German people, and it is certainly most significant that the
   Reformation broke out on the soil where the mystics lived and wrought,
   and their piety took deep root. They have a perennial life for souls
   who, seeking devotional companionship, continue to go back to the
   leaders of that remarkable pietistic movement.

   The leading features of the mysticism of the fourteenth and fifteenth
   centuries may be summed up in the following propositions.

   1. Its appeals were addressed to laymen as well as to clerics.

   2. The mystics emphasized instruction and preaching, and, if we except
   Suso, withdrew the emphasis which had been laid upon the traditional
   ascetic regulations of the Church. They did not commend buffetings of
   the body. The distance between Peter Damiani and Tauler is world-wide.

   3. They used the New Testament more than they used the Old Testament,
   and the words of Christ took the place of the Canticles in their
   interpretations of the mind of God. The German Theology quotes scarcely
   a single passage which is not found in the New Testament, and the
   Imitation of Christ opens with the quotation of words spoken by our
   Lord. Eckart and Tauler dwell upon passages of the New Testament, and
   Ruysbroeck evolves the fulness of his teaching from Matthew 25:6,
   "Behold the Bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet him."

   4. In the place of the Church, with its sacraments and priesthood as a
   saving institution, is put Christ himself as the mediator between the
   soul and God, and he is offered as within the reach of all.

   5. A pure life is taught to be a necessary accompaniment of the higher
   religious experience, and daily exemplification is demanded of that
   humility which the Gospel teaches.

   6. Another notable feature was their use of the vernacular in sermon
   and treatise. The mystics are among the very earliest masters of German
   and Dutch prose. In the Introduction to his second edition of the
   German Theology, Luther emphasized this aspect of their activity when
   he said, "I thank God that I have heard and find my God in the German
   tongue as neither I nor they [the adherents of the old way] have found
   Him in the Latin and Hebrew tongues." In this regard also the mystics
   of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries were precursors of the
   evangelical movement of the sixteenth century. Their practice was in
   plain conflict with the judgment of that German bishop who declared
   that the German language was too barbarous a tongue to be a proper
   vehicle of religious truth.

   The religious movement represented by German and Dutch mysticism is an
   encouraging illustration that God's Spirit may be working effectually
   in remote and unthought-of places and at times when the fabric of the
   Church seems to be hopelessly undermined with formalism, clerical
   corruption and hierarchical arrogance and worldliness. It was so at a
   later day when, in the little and remote Moravian town of Herrnhut, God
   was preparing the weak things of the world, and the things which were
   apparently foolish, to confound the dead orthodoxy of German
   Protestantism and to lead the whole Protestant Church into the way of
   preaching the Gospel in all the world. No organized body survived the
   mystics along the Rhine, but their example and writings continue to
   encourage piety and simple faith toward God within the pale of the
   Catholic and Protestant churches alike.

   A classification of the German mystics on the basis of speculative and
   practical tendencies has been attempted, but it cannot be strictly
   carried out. [432] In Eckart and Ruysbroeck, the speculative element
   was in the ascendant; in Tauler, the devotional; in Suso, the
   emotional; in Groote and other men of the Lowlands, the practical.

   [428] See Inge, Engl. Mystics, p. 37. This author, in his Christian
   Mysticism, p. 5, gives the definition that mysticism is "the attempt to
   realize in the thought and feeling the immanence of the temporal in the
   eternal and of the eternal in the temporal." His statements in another
   place, The Inner Way, pp. xx-xxii, are more simple and illuminating.
   The mystical theology is that knowledge of God and of divine things
   which is derived not from observation or from argument but from
   conscious experience. The difficulty of giving a precise definition of
   mysticism is seen in the definitions Inge cites, Christian Mysticism,
   Appendix A. Comp. Deutsch, p. 632 sq

   [429] It is quite in keeping with this contrast that Pfleiderer, in his
   Religionsphilosophie, excludes the German mystics from a place in the
   history of German philosophy on the ground that their thinking was not
   distinctly systematic. He, however, gives a brief statement to Eckart,
   but excludes Jacob Boehme.

   [430] Dogmengesch., p. 631.

   [431] Nicoll, Garden of Nuts, p. 31, says, "We study the mystics to
   learn from them. It need not be disguised that there are great
   difficulties in the way. The mystics are the most individual of
   writers," etc.

   [432] See Preger, I. 8, and Ullmann, Reformatoren, II. 203. Harnack
   goes far when he denies all originality to the German mystics. Of
   Eckart he says, Dogmengesch. III. 378, "I give no extracts from his
   writings because I do not wish to seem to countenance the error that
   the German mystics expressed anything we cannot read in Origen,
   Plotinus, the Areopagite, Augustine, Erigena, Bernard and Thomas
   Aquinas, or that they represented a stage of religious progress." The
   message they announced was certainly a fresh one to their generation,
   even if all they said bad been said before. They spoke from the living
   sources of their own spiritual experience. They were not imitators.
   Harnack, however, goes on to give credit to the German mystics for
   fulfilling a mission when he says they are of invaluable worth for the
   history of doctrine and the church history of Germany. In the same
   connection he denies the distinction between mysticism and scholastic
   theology." Mysticism," he asserts, "cannot exist in the Protestant
   Church, and the Protestant who is a mystic and does not become a Roman
   Catholic is a dilettante." This condemnation is based upon the
   untenable premise that mysticism is essentially conventual, excluding
   sane intellectual criticism and a practical out-of-doors Christianity.

   § 29. Meister Eckart.

   Meister Eckart, 1260-1327, the first in the line of the German mystics,
   was excelled in vigor of thought by no religious thinker of his
   century, and was the earliest theologian who wrote in German. [433] The
   philosophical bent of his mind won for him from Hegel the title,
   "father of German philosophy." In spite of the condemnation passed upon
   his writings by the pope, his memory was regarded with veneration by
   the succeeding generation of mystics. His name, however, was almost
   forgotten in later times. Mosheim barely mentions it, and the
   voluminous historian, Schroeckh, passes it by altogether. Baur, in his
   History of the Middle Ages, devotes to Eckart and Tauler only three
   lines, and these under the head of preaching, and makes no mention at
   all of German mysticism. His memory again came to honor in the last
   century, and in the German church history of the later Middle Ages he
   is now accorded a place of pre-eminence for his freshness of thought,
   his warm piety and his terse German style. [434] With Albertus Magnus
   and Rupert of Deutz he stands out as the earliest prominent
   representative in the history of German theology.

   During the century before Eckart, the German church also had its
   mystics, and in the twelfth century the godly women, Hildegard of
   Bingen and Elizabeth of Schoenau, added to the function of prophecy a
   mystical element. In the thirteenth century the Benedictine convent of
   Helfta, near Eisleben, Luther's birthplace, was a centre of religious
   warmth. Among its nuns were several by the names of Gertrude and
   Mechthild, who excelled by their religious experiences, and wrote on
   the devotional life. Gertrude of Hackeborn, d. 1292, abbess of Helfta,
   and Gertrude the Great, d. 1302, professed to have immediate communion
   with the Saviour and to be the recipients of divine revelations. When
   one of the Mechthilds asked Christ where he was to be found, the reply
   was, "You may seek me in the tabernacle and in Gertrude's heart." From
   1293 Gertrude the Great recorded her revelations in a work called the
   Communications of Piety--Insinuationes divinae pietatis. Mechthild of
   Magdeburg, d. 1280, and Mechthild of Hackeborn, d. 1310, likewise nuns
   of Helfta, also had visions which they wrote out. The former, who for
   thirty years had been a Beguine, Deutsch calls " one of the most
   remarkable personalities in the religious history of thirteenth
   century." Mechthild of Hackeborn, a younger sister of the abbess
   Gertrude, in her book on special grace,--Liber specialis gratiae,--sets
   forth salvation as the gift of grace without the works of the law.
   These women wrote in German. [435]

   David of Augsburg, d. 1271, the inquisitor who wrote on the
   inquisition,--De inquisitione haereticorum,--also wrote on the
   devotional life. These writings were intended for monks, and two of
   them [436] are regarded as pearls of German prose.

   In the last years of the thirteenth century, the Franciscan Lamprecht
   of Regensburg wrote a poem entitled "Daughter of Zion" (Cant. III. 11),
   which, in a mystical vein, depicts the soul, moved by the impulse of
   love, and after in vain seeking its satisfaction in worldly things, led
   by faith and hope to God. The Dominicans, Dietrich of Freiburg and John
   of Sterngassen, were also of the same tendency. [437] The latter
   labored in Strassburg.

   Eckart broke new paths in the realm of German religious thought. He was
   born at Hochheim, near Gotha, and died probably in Cologne. [438] In
   the last years of the thirteenth century he was prior of the Dominican
   convent of Erfurt, and provincial of the Dominicans in Thuringia, and
   in 1300 was sent to Paris to lecture, taking the master's degree, and
   later the doctorate. After his sojourn in France he was made prior of
   his order in Saxony, a province at that time extending from the
   Lowlands to Livland. In 1311 he was again sent to Paris as a teacher.
   Subsequently he preached in Strassburg, was prior in Frankfurt, 1320,
   and thence went to Cologne.

   Charges of heresy were preferred against him in 1325 by the archbishop
   of Cologne, Henry of Virneburg. The same year the Dominicans, at their
   general chapter held in Venice, listened to complaints that certain
   popular preachers in Germany were leading the people astray, and sent a
   representative to make investigations. Henry of Virneburg had shown
   himself zealous in the prosecution of heretics. In 1322, Walter, a
   Beghard leader, was burnt, and in 1325 a number of Beghards died in the
   flames along the Rhine. It is possible that Eckart was quoted by these
   sectaries, and in this way was exposed to the charge of heresy.

   The archbishop's accusations, which had been sent to Rome, were set
   aside by Nicolas of Strassburg, Eckart's friend, who at the time held
   the position of inquisitor in Germany. In 1327, the archbishop again
   proceeded against the suspected preacher and also against Nicolas. Both
   appealed from the archbishop's tribunal to the pope. In February,
   Eckart made a public statement in the Dominican church at Cologne,
   declaring he had always eschewed heresy in doctrine and declension in
   morals, and expressed his readiness to retract errors, if such should
   be found in his writings. [439]

   In a bull dated March 27, 1329, John XXII. announced that of the 26
   articles charged against Eckart, 15 were heretical and the remaining 11
   had the savor of heresy. Two other articles, not cited in the
   indictment, were also pronounced heretical. The papal decision stated
   that Eckart had acknowledged the 17 condemned articles as heretical.
   There is no evidence of such acknowledgment in the offenders extant
   writing. [440]

   Among the articles condemned were the following. As soon as God was, He
   created the world.--The world is eternal.--External acts are not in a
   proper sense good and divine.--The fruit of external acts does not make
   us good, but internal acts which the Father works in us.--God loves the
   soul, not external acts. The two added articles charged Eckart with
   holding that there is something in the soul which is uncreated and
   uncreatable, and that God is neither good nor better nor best, so that
   God can no more be called good than white can be called black.

   Eckart merits study as a preacher and as a mystic theologian.

   As a Preacher.--His sermons were delivered in churches and at
   conferences within cloistral walls. His style is graphic and
   attractive, to fascination. The reader is carried on by the progress of
   thought. The element of surprise is prominent. Eckart's extant sermons
   are in German, and the preacher avoids dragging in Latin phrases to
   explain his meaning, though, if necessary, he invents new German terms.
   He quotes the Scriptures frequently, and the New Testament more often
   than the Old, the passages most dwelt upon being those which describe
   the new birth, the sonship of Christ and believers, and love. Eckart is
   a master in the use of illustrations, which he drew chiefly from the
   sphere of daily observation,--the world of nature, the domestic circle
   and the shop. Although he deals with some of the most abstruse truths,
   he betrays no ambition to make a show of speculative subtlety. On the
   contrary, he again and again expresses a desire to be understood by his
   hearers, who are frequently represented as in dialogue with himself and
   asking for explanations of difficult questions. Into the dialogue are
   thrown such expressions as "in order that you may understand," and in
   using certain illustrations he on occasion announces that he uses them
   to make himself understood. [441]

   The following is a resumé of a sermon on John 6:44, "No man can come
   unto me except the Father draw him." [442] In drawing the sinner that
   He may convert him, God draws with more power than he would use if He
   were to make a thousand heavens and earths. Sin is an offence against
   nature, for it breaks God's image in us. For the soul, sin is death,
   for God is the soul's true life. For the heart, it is restlessness, for
   a thing is at rest only when it is in its natural state. Sin is a
   disease and blindness, for it blinds men to the brief duration of time,
   the evils of fleshly lust and the long duration of the pains of hell.
   It is bluntness to all grace. Sin is the prison-house of hell. People
   say they intend to turn away from their sins. But how can one who is
   dead make himself alive again? And by one's own powers to turn from sin
   unto God is much less possible than it would be for the dead to make
   themselves alive. God himself must draw. Grace flows from the Father's
   heart continually, as when He says, "I have loved thee with an
   everlasting love."

   There are three things in nature which draw, and these three Christ had
   on the cross. The first was his fellow-likeness to Us. As the bird
   draws to itself the bird of the same nature, so Christ drew the
   heavenly Father to himself, so that the Father forgot His wrath in
   contemplating the sufferings of the cross. Again Christ draws by his
   self-emptiness. As the empty tube draws water into itself, so the Son,
   by emptying himself and letting his blood flow, drew to himself all the
   grace from the Father's heart. The third thing by which he draws is the
   glowing heat of his love, even as the sun with its heat draws up the
   mists from the earth.

   The historian of the German mediaeval pulpit, Cruel, has said, [443]
   "Eckart's sermons hold the reader by the novelty and greatness of their
   contents, by their vigor of expression and by the genial frankness of
   the preacher himself, who is felt to be putting his whole soul into his
   effort and to be giving the most precious things he is able to give."
   He had his faults, but in spite of them "he is the boldest and most
   profound thinker the German pulpit has ever had,--a preacher of such
   original stamp of mind that the Church in Germany has not another like
   him to offer in all the centuries."

   Eckart as a Theological Thinker.--Eckart was still bound in part by the
   scholastic method. His temper, however, differed widely from the temper
   of the Schoolmen. Anselm, Hugo of St. Victor, Thomas Aquinas and
   Bonaventura, who united the mystical with the scholastic element, were
   predominantly Schoolmen, seeking to exhaust every supposable
   speculative problem. No purpose of this kind appears in Eckart's
   writings. He is dominated by a desire not so much to reach the
   intellect as to reach the soul and to lead it into immediate fellowship
   with God. With him the weapons of metaphysical dexterity are not on
   show; and in his writings, so far as they are known, he betrays no
   inclination to bring into the area of his treatment those remoter
   topics of speculation, from the constitution of the angelic world to
   the motives and actions which rule and prevail in the regions of hell.
   God and the soul's relation to Him are the engrossing subjects. [444]
   The authorities upon whom Eckart relied most, if we are to judge by his
   quotations, were Dionysius the Areopagite, and St. Bernard, though he
   also quotes from Augustine, Jerome and Gregory the Great, from Plato,
   Avicenna and Averrhoes. His discussions are often introduced by such
   expressions as "the masters say," or "some masters say." As a mystical
   thinker he has much in common with the mystics who preceded him,
   Neo-Platonic and Christian, but he was no servile reproducer of the
   past. Freshness characterizes his fundamental principles and his
   statement of them. In the place of love for Jesus, the precise
   definitions of the stages of contemplation emphasized by the school of
   St. Victor and the hierarchies and ladders and graduated stairways of
   Dionysius, he magnifies the new birth in the soul, and sonship. [445]

   As for God, He is absolute being, Deus est esse. The Godhood is
   distinct from the persons of the Godhead,--a conception which recalls
   Gilbert of Poictiers, or even the quaternity which Peter the Lombard
   was accused of setting up. The Trinity is the method by which this
   Godhood reveals itself by a process which is eternal. Godhood is simple
   essence having in itself the potentiality of all things. [446] God has
   form, and yet is without form, is being, and yet is without being.
   Great teachers say that God is above being. This is not correct, for
   God may as little be called a being, ein Wesen, as the sun may be
   called black or pale. [447]

   All created things were created out of nothing, and yet they were
   eternally in God. The master who produces pieces of art, first had all
   his art in himself. The arts are master within the master. Likewise the
   first Principle, which Eckart calls Erstigkeit, embodied in itself all
   images, that is, God in God. Creation is an eternal act. As soon as God
   was, He created the world. Without creatures, God would not be God. God
   is in all things and all things are God--Nu sint all Ding gleich in
   Gott und sint Got selber. [448] Thomas Aquinas made a clear distinction
   between the being of God and the being of created things. Eckart
   emphasized their unity. What he meant was that the images or universals
   exist in God eternally, as he distinctly affirmed when he said, "In the
   Father are the images of all creatures." [449]

   As for the soul, it can be as little comprehended in a definition as
   God Himself. [450] The soul's kernel, or its ultimate essence, is the
   little spark, Fünkelein, a light which never goes out which is
   uncreated and uncreatable. [451] Notwithstanding these statements, the
   German theologian affirms that God created the soul and poured into it,
   in the first instance, all His own purity. Through the spark the soul
   is brought into union with God, and becomes more truly one with Him
   than food does with the body. The soul cannot rest till it returns to
   God, and to do 80 it must first die to itself, that is, completely
   submit itself to God. [452] Eckart's aim in all his sermons, as he
   asserts, was to reach this spark.

   It is one of Eckart's merits that he lays so much stress upon the
   dignity of the soul. Several of his tracts bear this title. [453] This
   dignity follows from God's love and regenerative operation.

   Passing to the incarnation, it is everywhere the practical purpose
   which controls Eckart's treatment, and not the metaphysical. The second
   person of the Trinity took on human nature, that man might become
   partaker of the divine nature. In language such as Gregory of Nyssa
   used, he said, God became man that we might become God. Gott ist Mensch
   worden dass wir Gott wurden. As God was hidden within the human nature
   so that we saw there only man, so the soul is to be hidden within the
   divine nature, that we should see nothing but God. [454] As certainly
   as God begets the Son from His own nature, so certainly does He beget
   Him in the soul. God is in all things, but He is in the soul alone by
   birth, and nowhere else is He so truly as in the soul. No one can know
   God but the only begotten Son. Therefore, to know God, man must through
   the eternal generation become Son. It is as true that man becomes God
   as that God was made man. [455]

   The generation of the eternal Son in the soul brings joy which no man
   can take away. A prince who should lose his kingdom and all worldly
   goods would still have fulness of joy, for his birth outweighs
   everything else. [456] God is in the soul, and yet He is not the soul.
   The eye is not the piece of wood upon which it looks, for when the eye
   is closed, it is the same eye it was before. But if, in the act of
   looking, the eye and the wood should become one, then we might say the
   eye is the wood and the wood is the eye. If the wood were a spiritual
   substance like the eyesight, then, in reality, one might say eye and
   wood are one substance. [457] The fundament of God's being is the
   fundament of my being, and the fundament of my being is the fundament
   of God's being. Thus I live of myself even as God lives of Himself.
   [458] This begetment of the Son of God in the soul is the source of all
   true life and good works.

   One of the terms which Eckart uses most frequently, to denote God's
   influence upon the soul, is durchbrechen, to break through, and his
   favorite word for the activity of the soul, as it rises into union with
   God, is Abgeschiedenheit, the soul's complete detachment of itself from
   all that is temporal and seen. Keep aloof, abgeschieden, he says, from
   men, from yourself, from all that cumbers. Bear God alone in your
   hearts, and then practise fasting, vigils and prayer, and you will come
   unto perfection. This Abgeschiedenheit, total self-detachment from
   created things, [459] he says in a sermon on the subject, is "the one
   thing needful." After reading many writings by pagan masters and
   Christian teachers, Eckart came to consider it the highest of all
   virtues,--higher than humility, higher even than love, which Paul
   praises as the highest; for, while love endures all things, this
   quality is receptiveness towards God. In the person possessing this
   quality, the worldly has nothing to correspond to itself. This is what
   Paul had reference to when he said, "I live and yet not I, for Christ
   liveth in me." God is Himself perfect Abgeschiedenheit.

   In another place, Eckart says that he who has God in his soul finds God
   in all things, and God appears to him out of all things. As the thirsty
   love water, so that nothing else tastes good to them, even so it is
   with the devoted soul. In God and God alone is it at rest. God seeks
   rest, and He finds it nowhere but in such a heart. To reach this
   condition of Abgeschiedenheit, it is necessary for the soul first to
   meditate and form an image of God, and then to allow itself to be
   transformed by God. [460]

   What, then, some one might say, is the advantage of prayer and good
   works? In eternity, God saw every prayer and every good work, and knew
   which prayer He could hear. Prayers were answered in eternity. God is
   unchangeable and cannot be moved by a prayer. It is we who change and
   are moved. The sun shines, and gives pain or pleasure to the eye,
   according as it is weak or sound. The sun does not change. God rules
   differently in different men. Different kinds of dough are put into the
   oven; the heat affects them differently, and one is taken out a loaf of
   fine bread, and another a loaf of common bread.

   Eckart is emphatic when he insists upon the moral obligation resting on
   God to operate in the soul that is ready to receive Him. God must pour
   Himself into such a man's being, as the sun pours itself into the air
   when it is clear and pure. God would be guilty of a great
   wrong--Gebrechen -- if He did not confer a great good upon him whom He
   finds empty and ready to receive Him. Even so Christ said of Zaccheus,
   that He must enter into his house. God first works this state in the
   soul, and He is obliged to reward it with the gift of Himself. "When I
   am blessed, selig, then all things are in me and in God, and where I
   am, there is God, and where God is, there I am." [461]

   Nowhere does Eckart come to a distinct definition of justification by
   faith, although he frequently speaks of faith as a heavenly gift. On
   the other hand, he gives no sign of laying stress on the penitential
   system. Everywhere there are symptoms in his writings that his piety
   breathed a different atmosphere from the pure mediaeval type. Holy
   living is with him the product of holy being. One must first be
   righteous before he can do righteous acts. Works do not sanctify. The
   righteous soul sanctifies the works. So long as one does good works for
   the sake of the kingdom of heaven or for the sake of God or for the
   sake of salvation or for any external cause, he is on the wrong path.
   Fastings, vigils, asceticisms, do not merit salvation. [462] There are
   places in the mystic's writings where we seem to hear Luther himself
   speaking.

   The stress which Eckart lays upon piety, as a matter of the heart and
   the denial to good works of meritorious virtue, gave plausible ground
   for the papal condemnation, that Eckart set aside the Church's doctrine
   of penance, affirming that it is not outward acts that make good, but
   the disposition of the soul which God abidingly works in us. John XXII.
   rightly discerned the drift of the mystic's teaching.

   In his treatment of Mary and Martha, Eckart seems to make a radical
   departure from the mediaeval doctrine of the superior value of pure
   contemplation. From the time of Augustine, Rachel and Mary of Bethany
   had been regarded as the representatives of the contemplative and
   higher life. In his sermon on Mary, the German mystic affirmed that
   Mary was still at school. Martha had learned and was engaged in good
   works, serving the Lord. Mary was only learning. She was striving to be
   as holy as her sister. Better to feed the hungry and do other works of
   mercy, he says, than to have the vision of Paul and to sit still. After
   Christ's ascension, Mary learned to serve as fully as did Martha, for
   then the Holy Spirit was poured out. One who lives a truly
   contemplative life will show it in active works. A life of mere
   contemplation is a selfish life. The modern spirit was stirring in him.
   He saw another ideal for life than mediaeval withdrawal from the world.
   The breath of evangelical freedom and joy is felt in his writings.
   [463]

   Eckart's speculative mind carried him to the verge of pantheism, and it
   is not surprising that his hyperbolical expressions subjected him to
   the papal condemnation. But his pantheism was Christian pantheism, the
   complete union of the soul with God. It was not absorption in the
   divine being involving the loss of individuality, but the reception of
   Godhood, the original principle of the Deity. What language could
   better express the idea that God is everything, and everything God,
   than these words, words adopted by Hegel as a sort of motto: "The eye
   with which I see God is the same eye with which God sees me. My eye and
   God's eye are the same, and there is but one sight, one apprehension,
   one love." [464] And yet such language, endangering, as it might seem,
   the distinct personality of the soul, was far better than the
   imperative insistence laid by accredited Church teachers on outward
   rituals and conformity to sacramental rites.

   Harnack and others have made the objection that the Cologne divine does
   not dwell upon the forgiveness of sins. This omission may be
   overlooked, when we remember the prominence given in his teaching to
   regeneration and man's divine sonship. His most notable departure from
   scholasticism consists in this, that he did not dwell upon the
   sacraments and the authority of the Church. He addressed himself to
   Christian individuals, and showed concern for their moral and spiritual
   well-being. Abstruse as some of his thinking is, there can never be the
   inkling of a thought that he was setting forth abstractions of the
   school and contemplating matters chiefly with a scientific eye. He
   makes the impression of being moved by strict honesty of purpose to
   reach the hearts of men. [465] His words glow with the Minne, or love,
   of which he preached so often. In one feature, however, he differed
   widely from modern writers and preachers. He did not dwell upon the
   historical Christ. With him Christ in us is the God in us, and that is
   the absorbing topic. With all his high thinking he felt the limitations
   of human statement and, counselling modesty in setting forth
   definitions of God, he said, "If we would reach the depth of God's
   nature, we must humble ourselves. He who would know God must first know
   himself." [466] Not a popular leader, not professedly a reformer, this
   early German theologian had a mission in preparing the way for the
   Reformation. The form and contents of his teaching had a direct
   tendency to encourage men to turn away from the authority of the
   priesthood and ritual legalism to the realm of inner experience for the
   assurance of acceptance with God. Pfleiderer has gone so far as to say
   that Eckart's "is the spirit of the Reformation, the spirit of Luther,
   the motion of whose wings we already feel, distinctly enough, in the
   thoughts of his older German fellow-citizen." [467] Although he
   declared his readiness to confess any heretical ideas that might have
   crept into his sermons and writings, the judges at Rome were right in
   principle. Eckart's spirit was heretical, provoking revolt against the
   authority of the mediaeval Church and a restatement of some of the
   forgotten verities of the New Testament.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [433] Eckart's name is written in almost every conceivable way in the
   documents. See Büttner, p. xxii, as Eckardus, Eccardus, Egghardus;
   Deutsch and Delacroix, Eckart; Pfeiffer, Preger, Inge and Langenberg,
   Eckhart; Denifle and Büttner, Eckehart. His writings give us scarcely a
   single clew to his fortunes. Quiétif-Echard was the first to lift the
   veil from portions of his career. See Preger, I. 325.

   [434] Deutsch, Herzog, V. 149, says that parts of Eckart's sermons
   might serve as models of German style to-day.

   [435] Flacius Illyricus includes the second Mechthild in his Catal.
   veritatis. For the lives of these women and the editions of their
   works, see Preger, I. 71-132, and the artt. of Deutsch and Zöckler in
   Herzog. Some of the elder Mechthild's predictions and descriptions seem
   to have been used by Dante. See Preger, p. 103 sq. Mechthild v.

   usually given as Strassburg. See Denifle, p. 355.

   Preger, I. 471 sqq., gives the Latin text of Eckart's statement of Jan.
   24, 1327, before the archiepiscopal court, his public statement of
   innocence in the Dominican church and the document containing the
   court's refusal to allow his appeal to Rome.

   [440] The 26 articles, as Denifle has shown, were based upon Eckart's
   Latin writings. John's bull is given by Preger, I. 479-482, and by
   Denifle, Archiv, II. 636-640. Preger, I. 365 sqq., Delacroix, p. 238
   and Deutsch, V. 145, insist that Eckart made no specific recantation.
   The pope's reference must have been to the statement Eckart made in the
   Dominican church, which contained the words, "I will amend and revoke
   in general and in detail, as often as may be found opportune, whatever
   is discovered to have a less wholesome sense, intellectum minus sane.

   [444] Denifle lays down the proposition that Eckart is above all a
   Schoolman, and that whatever there is of good in him is drawn from
   Thomas Aquinas. These conclusions are based upon Eckart's Latin
   writings. Deutsch, V. 15, says that the form of Eckart's thought in the
   Latin writings is scholastic, but the heart is mystical. Delacroix, p.
   277 sqq., denies that Eckart was a scholastic and followed Thomas.
   Wetzer-Welte, IV. 11, deplores as Eckart's defect that he departed from
   "the solid theology of Scholasticism" and took up Neo-Platonic
   vagaries. If Eckart had been a servile follower of Thomas, it is hard
   to understand how he should have laid himself open in 28 propositions
   to condemnation for heresy.

   [445] Harnack and, in a modified way, Delacroix and Loofs, regard
   Eckart's theology as a reproduction of Erigena, Dionysius and Plotinus.
   Delacroix, p. 240, says, sur tous les points essentiels, il est
   d'accord avec Plotin et Proclus. But, in another place, p. 260, he says
   Eckart took from Neo-Platonism certain leading conceptions and
   "elaborated, transformed and transmuted them." Loofs, p. 630, somewhat
   ambiguously says, Die ganze Eckehartsche Mystik ist verständlich als
   eine Erfassung der thomistischen und augustinischen Tradition unter dem
   Gesichtswinkel des Areopagiten.

   § 30. John Tauler of Strassburg.


   To do Thy will is more than praise,

   As words are less than deeds;

   And simple trust can find Thy ways

   We miss with chart of creeds.

   - Whittier. Our Master.

   Among the admirers of Eckart, the most distinguished were John Tauler
   and Heinrich Suso. With them the speculative element largely disappears
   and the experimental and practical elements predominate. They
   emphasized religion as a matter of experience and the rule of conduct.
   Without denying any of the teachings or sacraments of the Church, they
   made prominent immediate union with Christ, and dwelt upon the
   Christian graces, especially patience, gentleness and humility. Tauler
   was a man of sober mind, Suso poetical and imaginative.

   John Tauler, called doctor illuminatus, was born in Strassburg about
   1300, and died there, 1361. Referring to his father's circumstances, he
   once said, "If, as my father's son, I had once known what I know now, I
   would have lived from my paternal inheritance instead of resorting to
   alms." [468] Probably as early as 1315, he entered the Dominican order.
   Sometime before 1330, he went to Cologne to take the usual three-years'
   course of study. That he proceeded from there to Paris for further
   study is a statement not borne out by the evidence. He, however, made a
   visit in the French capital at one period of his career. Nor is there
   sufficient proof that he received the title doctor or master, although
   he is usually called Dr. John Tauler.

   He was in his native city again when it lay under the interdict
   fulminated against it in 1329, during the struggle between John XXII.
   and Lewis the Bavarian. The Dominicans offered defiance, continuing to
   say masses till 1339, when they were expelled for three years by the
   city council. We next find Tauler at Basel, where he came into close
   contact with the Friends of God, and their leader, Henry of Nördlingen.
   After laboring as priest in Bavaria, Henry went to the Swiss city,
   where he was much sought after as a preacher by the clergy and laymen,
   men and women. In 1357, Tauler was in Cologne, but Strassburg was the
   chief seat of his activity. Among his friends were Christina Ebner,
   abbess of a convent near Nürnberg, and Margaret Ebner, a nun of the
   Bavarian convent of Medingen, women who were mystics and recipients of
   visions. [469] Tauler died in the guest-chamber of a nunnery in
   Strassburg, of which his sister was an inmate.

   Tauler's reputation in his own day rested upon his power as a preacher,
   and it is probable that his sermons have been more widely read in the
   Protestant Church than those of other mediaeval preachers. The reason
   for this popularity is the belief that the preacher was controlled by
   an evangelical spirit which brought him into close affinity with the
   views of the Reformers. His sermons, which were delivered in German,
   are plain statements of truth easily understood, and containing little
   that is allegorical or fanciful. They attempt no display of learning or
   speculative ingenuity. When Tauler quotes from Augustine, Gregory the
   Great, Dionysius, Anselm or Thomas Aquinas, as he sometimes does,
   though not as frequently as Eckart, he does it in an incidental way.
   His power lay in his familiarity with the Scriptures, his knowledge of
   the human heart, his simple style and his own evident sincerity. [470]
   He was a practical every-day preachers intent on reaching men in their
   various avocations and trials.

   If we are to follow the History of Tauler's Life and Conscience, which
   appeared in the first published edition of his works, 1498, Tauler
   underwent a remarkable spiritual change when he was fifty. [471] Under
   the influence of Nicolas of Basel, a Friend of God from the Oberland,
   he was then led into a higher stage of Christian experience. Already
   had he achieved the reputation of an effective preacher when Nicolas,
   after hearing him several times, told him that he was bound in the
   letter and that, though he preached sound doctrine, he did not feel the
   power of it himself. He called Tauler a Pharisee. The rebuked man was
   indignant, but his monitor replied that he lacked humility and that,
   instead of seeking God's honor, he was seeking his own. Feeling the
   justice of the criticism, Tauler confessed he had been told his sins
   and faults for the first time. At Nicolas' advice he desisted from
   preaching for two years, and led a retired life. At the end of that
   time Nicolas visited him again, and bade him resume his sermons.
   Tauler's first attempt, made in a public place and before a large
   concourse of people, was a failure. The second sermon he preached in a
   nunnery from the text, Matt. 25:6, "Behold the bridegroom cometh, go ye
   out to meet him," and so powerful was the impression that 50 persons
   fell to the ground like dead men. During the period of his seclusion,
   Tauler had surrendered himself entirely to God, and after it he
   continued to preach with an unction and efficiency before unknown in
   his experience.

   Some of Tauler's expressions might give the impression that he was
   addicted to quietistic views, as when he speaks of being "drowned in
   the Fatherhood of God," of "melting in the fire of His love," of being
   "intoxicated with God." But these tropical expressions, used
   occasionally, are offset by the sober statements in which he portrays
   the soul's union with God. To urge upon men to surrender themselves
   wholly to God and to give a practical exemplification of their union
   with Him in daily conduct was his mission.

   He emphasized the agency of the Holy Spirit, who enlightens and
   sanctifies, who rebukes sin and operates in the heart to bring it to
   self-surrender. [472] The change effected by the Spirit, which he
   called Kehr -- conversion--he dwelt upon continually. The word, which
   frequently occurs in his sermons, was almost a new word in mediaeval
   sermonic vocabulary. Tauler also insisted upon the Eckartian
   Abgeschiedenheit, detachment from the world, and says that a soul, to
   become holy, must become "barren and empty of all created things," and
   rid of all that "pertains to the creature." When the soul is full of
   the creature, God must of necessity remain apart from it, and such a
   soul is like a barrel that has been filled with refuse or decaying
   matter. It cannot thereafter be used for good, generous wine or any
   other pure drink. [473]

   As for good works, if done apart from Christ, they are of no avail.
   Tauler often quoted the words of Isaiah 64:6. "All our righteousnesses
   are as a polluted garment." By his own power, man cannot come unto God.
   Those who have never felt anxiety on account of their sins are in the
   most dangerous condition of all. [474]

   The sacraments suffer no depreciation at Tauler's hands, though they
   are given a subordinate place. They are all of no avail without the
   change of the inward man. Good people linger at the outward symbols,
   and fail to get at the inward truth symbolized. Yea, by being unduly
   concerned about their movements in the presence of the Lord's body,
   they miss receiving him spiritually. Men glide, he says, through
   fasting, prayer, vigils and other exercises, and take so much delight
   in them that God has a very small part in their hearts, or no part in
   them at all. [475]

   In insisting upon the exercise of a simple faith, it seems almost
   impossible to avoid the conclusion that Tauler took an attitude of
   intentional opposition to the prescient and self-confident methods of
   scholasticism. It is better to possess a simple faith--einfaltiger
   Glaube -- than to vainly pry into the secrets of God, asking questions
   about the efflux and reflux of the Aught and Nought, or about the
   essence of the soul's spark. The Arians and Sabellians had a marvellous
   intellectual understanding of the Trinity, and Solomon and Origen
   interested the Church in a marvellous way, but what became of them we
   know not. The chief thing is to yield oneself to God's will and to
   follow righteousness with sincerity of purpose. "Wisdom is not studied
   in Paris, but in the sufferings of the Lord," Tauler said. The great
   masters of Paris read large books, and that is well. But the people who
   dwell in the inner kingdom of the soul read the true Book of Life. A
   pure heart is the throne of the Supreme Judge, a lamp bearing the
   eternal light, a treasury of divine riches, a storehouse of heavenly
   sweetness, the sanctuary of the only begotten Son. [476]

   A distinctly democratic element showed itself in Tauler's piety and
   preaching which is very attractive. He put honor upon all legitimate
   toil, and praised good and faithful work as an expression of true
   religion. One, he said, "can spin, another can make shoes, and these
   are the gifts of the Holy Ghost; and I tell you that, if I were not a
   priest, I should esteem it a great gift to be able to make shoes, and
   would try to make them so well as to become a pattern to all." Fidelity
   in one's avocation is more than attendance upon church. He spoke of a
   peasant whom he knew well for more than forty years. On being asked
   whether he should give up his work and go and sit in church, the Lord
   replied no, he should win his bread by the sweat of his brow, and thus
   he would honor his own precious blood. The sympathetic element in his
   piety excluded the hard spirit of dogmatic complacency. "I would rather
   bite my tongue," Tauler said, "till it bleed, than pass judgment upon
   any man. Judgment we should leave to God, for out of the habit of
   sitting in judgment upon one's neighbor grow self-satisfaction and
   arrogance, which are of the devil." [477]

   It was these features, and especially Tauler's insistence upon the
   religious exercises of the soul and the excellency of simple faith,
   that won Luther's praise, first in letters to Lange and Spalatin,
   written in 1516. To Spalatin he wrote that he had found neither in the
   Latin nor German tongue a more wholesome theology than Tauler's, or one
   more consonant with the Gospel. [478]

   The mood of the heretic, however, was furthest from Tauler. Strassburg
   knew what heresy was, and had proved her orthodoxy by burning heretics.
   Tauler was not of their number. He sought to call a narrow circle away
   from the formalities of ritual to close communion with God, but the
   Church was to him a holy mother. In his reverence for the Virgin, he
   stood upon mediaeval ground. Preaching on the Annunciation, he said
   that in her spirit was the heaven of God, in her soul His paradise, in
   her body His palace. By becoming the mother of Christ, she became the
   daughter of the Father, the mother of the Son, the Holy Spirit's bride.
   She was the second Eve, who restored all that the first Eve lost, and
   Tauler does not hesitate to quote some of Bernard's passionate words
   pronouncing Mary the sinner's mediator with Christ. He himself sought
   her intercession. If any one could have seen into her heart, he said,
   he would have seen God in all His glory. [479]

   Though he was not altogether above the religious perversions of the
   mediaeval Church, John Tauler has a place among the godly leaders of
   the Church universal, who have proclaimed the virtue of simple faith
   and immediate communion with God and the excellency of the
   unostentatious practice of righteousness from day to day. He was an
   expounder of the inner life, and strikes the chord of fellowship in all
   who lay more stress upon pure devotion and daily living than upon
   ritual exercises. A spirit congenial to his was Whittier, whose
   undemonstrative piety poured itself out in hearty appreciation of his
   unseen friend of the fourteenth century. The modern Friend represents
   the mysterious stranger, who pointed out to Tauler the better way, as
   saying:--


   What hell may be, I know not. This I know,

   I cannot lose the presence of the Lord.

   One arm, Humility, takes hold upon

   His dear humanity; the other, Love,

   Clasps His divinity. So where I go

   He goes; and better fire-walled hell with Him

   Than golden-gated Paradise without.

   Said Tauler,


   My prayer is answered. God hath sent the man,

   Long sought, to teach me, by his simple trust,

   Wisdom the weary Schoolmen never knew.

   [470] Specklin, the Strassburg chronicler, says Tauler spoke "in clear

   § 31. Henry Suso.

   Henry Suso, 1295?-1366, a man of highly emotional nature, has on the
   one hand been treated as a hysterical visionary, and on the other as
   the author of the most finished product of German mysticism. Born on
   the Lake of Constance, and perhaps in Constance itself, he was of noble
   parentage, but on the death of his mother, abandoned his father's name,
   Berg, and adopted his mother's maiden name, Seuse, Suso being the Latin
   form. [480] At thirteen, he entered the Dominican convent at Constance,
   and from his eighteenth year on gave himself up to the most exaggerated
   and painful asceticisms. At twenty-eight, he was studying at Cologne,
   and later at Strassburg.

   For supporting the pope against Lewis the Bavarian, the Dominicans in
   Constance came into disfavor, and were banished from the city. Suso
   retired to Diessehoven, where he remained, 1339-1346, serving as prior.
   During this period, he began to devote himself to preaching. The last
   eighteen years of his life were spent in the Dominican convent at Ulm,
   where he died, Jan. 25, 1366. He was beatified by Gregory XVI., 1831.

   Suso's constitution, which was never strong, was undermined by the
   rigorous penitential discipline to which he subjected himself for
   twenty-two years. An account of it is given in his Autobiography. Its
   severity, so utterly contrary to the spirit of our time, was so
   excessive that Suso's statements seem at points to be almost
   incredible. The only justification for repeating some of the details is
   to show the lengths to which the penitential system of the Mediaeval
   Church was carried by devotees. Desiring to carry the marks of the Lord
   Jesus, Suso pricked into his bare chest, with a sharp instrument, the
   monogram of Christ, IHS. The three letters remained engraven there till
   his dying day and, "Whenever my heart moved," as he said, "the name
   moved also." At one time he saw in a dream rays of glory illuminating
   the scar.

   He wore a hair shirt and an iron chain. The loss of blood forced him to
   put the chain aside, but for the hair shirt he substituted an
   undergarment, studded with 150 sharp tacks. This he wore day and night,
   its points turned inwards towards his body. Often, he said, it made the
   impression on him as if he were lying in a nest of wasps. When he saw
   his body covered with vermin, and yet he did not die, he exclaimed that
   the murderer puts to death at one stroke, "but alas, O tender God, --
   zarter Gott,--what a dying is this of mine!" Yet this was not enough.
   Suso adopted the plan of tying around his neck a part of his girdle. To
   this he attached two leather pockets, into which he thrust his hands.
   These he made fast with lock and key till the next morning. This kind
   of torture he continued to practise for sixteen years, when he
   abandoned it in obedience to a heavenly vision. How little had the
   piety of the Middle Ages succeeded in correcting the perverted views of
   the old hermits of the Nitrian desert, whose stories this Swiss monk
   was in the habit of reading, and whose austerities he emulated!

   God, however, had not given any intimation of disapproval of ascetic
   discipline, and so Suso, in order further to impress upon his body
   marks of godliness, bound against his back a wooden cross, to which, in
   memory of the 30 wounds of Christ, he affixed 30 spikes. On this
   instrument of torture he stretched himself at night for 8 years. The
   last year he affixed to it 7 sharp needles. For a long time he went
   through 2 penitential drills a day, beating with his fist upon the
   cross as it hung against his back, while the needles and nails
   penetrated into his flesh, and the blood flowed down to his feet. As if
   this were not a sufficient imitation of the flagellation inflicted upon
   Christ, he rubbed vinegar and salt into his wounds to increase his
   agony. His feet became full of sores, his legs swelled as if he had had
   the dropsy, his flesh became dry and his hands trembled as if palsied.
   And all this, as he says, he endured out of the great inner love which
   he had for God, and our Lord Jesus Christ, whose agonizing pains he
   wanted to imitate. For 25 years, cold as the winter might be, he
   entered no room where there was a fire, and for the same period he
   abstained from all bathing, water baths or sweat baths--Wasserbad und
   Schweissbad. But even with this list of self-mortifications, Suso said,
   the whole of the story was not told.

   In his fortieth year, when his physical organization had been reduced
   to a wreck, so that nothing remained but to die or to desist from the
   discipline, God revealed to him that his long-practised austerity was
   only a good beginning, a breaking up of his untamed humanity,--Ein
   Durchbrechen seines ungebrochenen Menschen,--and that thereafter he
   would have to try another way in order to "get right." And so he
   proceeded to macerations of the inner man, and learned the lessons
   which asceticisms of the soul can impart.

   Suso nowhere has words of condemnation for such barbarous self-imposed
   torture, a method of pleasing God which the Reformation put aside in
   favor of saner rules of piety.

   Other sufferings came upon Suso, but not of his own infliction. These
   he bore with Christian submission, and the evils involved he sought to
   rectify by services rendered to others. His sister, a nun, gave way to
   temptation. Overcoming his first feelings of indignation, Suso went far
   and near in search of her, and had the joy of seeing her rescued to a
   worthy life, and adorned with all religious virtues. Another cross he
   had to bear was the charge that he was the father of an unborn child, a
   charge which for a time alienated Henry of Nördlingen and other close
   friends. He bore the insinuation without resentment, and even helped to
   maintain the child after it was born.

   Suso's chief writings, which abound in imagery and comparisons drawn
   from nature, are an Autobiography, [481] and works on The Eternal
   Wisdom--Büchlein von der ewigen Weisheit -- and the Truth--Büchlein von
   der Wahrheit. To these are to be added his sermons and letters.

   The Autobiography came to be preserved by chance. At the request of
   Elsbet Staglin, Suso told her a number of his experiences. This woman,
   the daughter of one of the leading men of Zürich, was an inmate of the
   convent of Tosse, near Winterthur. When Suso discovered that she had
   committed his conversations to writing, he treated her act as "a
   spiritual theft," and burnt a part of the manuscript. The remainder he
   preserved, in obedience to a supernatural communication, and revised.
   Suso appears in the book as "The Servant of the Eternal Wisdom."

   The Autobiography is a spiritual self-revelation in which the author
   does not pretend to follow the outward stages of his career. In
   addition to the facts of his religious experience, he sets forth a
   number of devotional rules containing much wisdom, and closes with
   judicious and edifying remarks on the being of God, which he gave to
   Elsbet in answer to her questions. [482]

   The Book of the Eternal Wisdom, which is in the form of a dialogue
   between Christ, the Eternal Wisdom, and the writer, has been called by
   Denifle, who bore Suso's name, the consummate fruit of German
   mysticism. It records, in German, [483] meditations in which use is
   made of the Scriptures. Here we have a body of experimental theology
   such as ruled among the more pious spirits in the German convents of
   the fourteenth century.

   Suso declares that one who is without love is as unable to understand a
   tongue that is quick with love as one speaking in German is unable to
   understand a Fleming, or as one who hears a report of the music of a
   harp is unable to understand the feelings of one who has heard the
   music with his own ears. The Saviour is represented as saying that it
   would be easier to bring back the years of the past, revive the
   withered flowers or collect all the droplets of rain than to measure
   the love--Minne -- he has for men.

   The Servant, after lamenting the hardness of heart which refuses to be
   moved by the spectacle of the cross and the love of God, seeks to
   discover how it is that God can at once be so loving and so severe. As
   for the pains of hell, the lost are represented as exclaiming, "Oh, how
   we desire that there might be a millstone as wide as the earth and
   reaching to all parts of heaven, and that a little bird might alight
   every ten thousand years and peck away a piece of stone as big as the
   tenth part of a millet seed and continue to peck away every ten
   thousandth year until it had pecked away a piece as big as a millet
   seed, and then go on pecking at the same rate until the whole stone
   were pecked away, so only our torture might come to an end; but that
   cannot be."

   Having dwelt upon the agony of the cross and God's immeasurable love,
   the bliss of heaven and the woes of hell, Suso proceeds to set forth
   the dignity of suffering. He had said in his Autobiography that "every
   lover is a martyr," [484] and here the Eternal Wisdom declares that if
   all hearts were become one heart, that heart could not bear the least
   reward he has chosen to give in eternity as a compensation for the
   least suffering endured out of love for himself .... This is an eternal
   law of nature that what is true and good must be harvested with sorrow.
   There is nothing more joyous than to have endured suffering. Suffering
   is short pain and prolonged joy. Suffering gives pain here and
   blessedness hereafter. Suffering destroys suffering--Leiden tödtet
   Leiden. Suffering exists that the sufferer may not suffer. He who could
   weigh time and eternity in even balances would rather he in a glowing
   oven for a hundred years than to miss in eternity the least reward
   given for the least suffering, for the suffering in the oven would have
   an end, but the reward is forever.

   After dwelling upon the advantages of contemplation as the way of
   attaining to the heavenly life, the Eternal Wisdom tells Suso how to
   die both the death of the body and the soul; namely, by penance and by
   self-detachment from all the things of the earth--Entbrechen von allen
   Dingen. An unconverted man is introduced in the agonies of dying. His
   hands grow cold, his face pales, his eyes begin to lose their sight.
   The prince of terrors wrestles with his heart and deals it hard blows.
   The chill sweat of death creeps over his body and starts haggard fears.
   "O angry countenance of the severe Judge, how sharp are thy judgments!"
   he exclaims. In imagination, or with real sight, he beholds the host of
   black Moors approaching to see whether he belongs to them, and then the
   beasts of hell surrounding him. He sees the hot flames rising up above
   the denizens of purgatory, and hears them cry out that the least of
   their tortures is greater than the keenest suffering endured by martyr
   on the earth. And that a day there is as a hundred years. They exclaim,
   "Now we roast, now we simmer and now we cry out in vain for help." The
   dying man then passes into the other world, calling out for help to the
   friends whom he had treated well on the earth, but in vain.

   The treatise, which closes with excellent admonitions on the duty of
   praising God continually, makes a profound spiritual impression, but it
   presents only one side of the spiritual life, and needs to be
   supplemented and expurgated in order to present a proper picture.
   Christ came into the world that we might have everlasting life now, and
   that we might have abundance of life, and that his joy might remain in
   us and our joy might be full. The patient endurance of suffering
   purifies the soul and the countenance, but suffering is not to be
   counted as always having a sanctifying power, much less is it to be
   courted. Macerations have no virtue of themselves, and patience in
   enduring pain is only one of the Christian virtues, and not their
   crown. Love, which is the bond of perfectness, finds in a cheerful
   spirit, in hearty human fellowships and in well-doing also, its
   ministries. The mediaeval type of piety turned the earth into a vale of
   tears. It was cloistral. For nearly 30 years, as Suso tells us, he
   never once broke through the rule of silence at table. [485] Innocent
   III. could write, just before becoming world-ruler, a treatise on the
   contempt of the world. The piety of the modern Church is of a cheerful
   type, and sees good everywhere in this world which God created. Suso's
   piety was what the Germans have called the mysticism of suffering--die
   Mystik des Leidens. His way of self-inflicted torture was the wrong
   way. In going, however, with Suso we will not fail to reach some of the
   heights of religious experience and to find nearness to God.

   Suso kept company with the Friends of God, and acknowledged his debt to
   Eckart, "the high teacher," "his high and holy master," from whose
   "sweet teachings he had taken deep draughts." As he says in his
   Autobiography, he went to Eckart in a time of spiritual trial, and was
   helped by him out of the hell of distress into which he had fallen. He
   uses some of Eckart's distinctive vocabulary, and after the Cologne
   rnystic's death, Suso saw him "in exceeding glory" and was admonished
   by him to submission. This quality forms the subject of Suso's Book on
   the Truth, which in part was meant to be a defence of his spiritual
   teacher.

   A passage bearing on the soul's union with Christ will serve as a
   specimen of Suso's tropical style, and may fitly close this chapter.
   The soul, so the Swiss mystic represents Christ as saying--

   "the soul that would find me in the inner closet of a consecrated and
   self-detached life,--abgeschiedenes Leben,--and would partake of my
   sweetness, must first be purified from evil and adorned with virtues,
   be decked with the red roses of passionate love, with the beautiful
   violets of meek submission, and must be strewn with the white lilies of
   purity. It shall embrace me with its arms, excluding all other loves,
   for these I shun and flee as the bird does the cage. This soul shall
   sing to me the song of Zion, which means passionate love combined with
   boundless praise. Then I will embrace it and it shall lean upon my
   heart." [486]

   § 32. The Friends of God.

   The Friends of God attract our interest both by the suggestion of
   religious fervor involved in their name and the respect with which the
   prominent mystics speak of them. They are frequently met within the
   writings of Eckart, Tauler, Suso, and Ruysbroeck, as well as in the
   pages of other writers of the fourteenth century. Much mystery
   surrounds them, and efforts have failed to define with precision their
   teachings, numbers and influence. The name had been applied to the
   Waldenses, [487] but in the fourteenth century it came to be a
   designation for coteries of pietists scattered along the Rhine, from
   Basel to Strassburg and to the Netherlands, laymen and priests who felt
   spiritual longings the usual church services did not satisfy. They did
   not constitute an organized sect. They were addicted to the study of
   the Scriptures, and sought close personal fellowship with God. They
   laid stress upon a godly life and were bent on the propagation of
   holiness. Their name was derived from John 16:15, "Henceforth I call
   you not servants, but I have called you friends." Their practices did
   not involve a breach with the Church and its ordinances. They had no
   sympathy with heresy, and antagonized the Brethren of the Free Spirit.
   The little treatise, called the German Theology, at the outset marks
   the difference between the Friends of God and the false, free spirits,
   especially the Beghards. [488]

   A letter written by a Friend to another Friend [489] represents as
   succinctly as any statement their aim when it says, "The soul that
   loves God must get away from the world, from the flesh and all sensual
   desires and away from itself, that is, away from its own self-will, and
   thus does it make ready to hear the message of the work and ministry of
   love accomplished by our Lord Jesus Christ." The house which Rulman
   Merswin founded in Strassburg was declared to be a house of refuge for
   honorable persons, priests and laymen who, with trust in God, choose to
   flee the world and seek to improve their lives. The Friends of God
   regarded themselves as holding the secret of the Christian life and as
   being the salt of the earth, the instructors of other men. [490]

   Among the leading Friends of God were Henry of Nördlingen, Nicolas of
   Löwen, Rulman Merswin and "the great Friend of God from the Oberland."
   The personality of the Friend of God from the Oberland is one of the
   most evasive in the religious history of the Middle Ages. He is
   presented as leader of great personal power and influence, as the man
   who determined Tauler's conversion and wrote a number of tracts, and
   yet it is doubtful whether such a personage ever lived. Rulman Merswin
   affirms that he had been widely active between Basel and Strassburg and
   in the region of Switzerland, from which he got his name, the Oberland.
   In 1377, according to the same authority, he visited Gregory XI. in
   Rome and, like Catherine of Siena, petitioned the pontiff to set his
   face against the abuses of Christendom. Rulman was in correspondence
   with him for a long period, and held his writings secret until within
   four years of his (Rulman's) death, when he published them. They were
   17 in number, all of them bearing on the nature and necessity of a true
   conversion of heart. [491]

   This mystic from the Oberland, as Rulman's account goes, led a life of
   prayer and devotion, and found peace, performed miracles and had
   visions. He is placed by Preger at the side of Peter Waldo as one of
   the most influential laymen of the Middle Ages, a priest, though
   unordained, of the Church. After Rulman's death, we hear no more of
   him.

   Rulman Merswin, the editor of the Oberland prophet's writings, was born
   in Stra6sburg, 1307, and died there, 1382. He gave up merchandise and
   devoted himself wholly to a religious life. He had undergone the change
   of conversion--Kehr. For four years he had a hard struggle against
   temptations, and subjected himself to severe asceticisms, but was
   advised by his confessor, Tauler, to desist, at least for a time. It
   was towards the end of this period that he met the man from the
   Oberland. After his conversion, he purchased and fitted up an old
   cloister, located on an island near Strassburg, called das grüne Wört,
   to serve as a refuge for clerics and laymen who wished to follow the
   principles of the Friends of God and live together for the purpose of
   spiritual culture. In 1370, after the death of his wife, Rulman himself
   became an inmate of the house, which was put under the care of the
   Knights of St. John a year later. Here he continued to exhort by pen
   and word till his death. He lies buried at the side of his wife in
   Strassburg.

   Merswin's two chief writings are entitled Das Bannerbüchlein, the
   Banner-book, and Das Buch von den neun Felsen, the Nine Rocks. The
   former is an exhortation to flee from the banner of Lucifer and to
   gather under the blood-red banner of Christ. [492] The Nine Rocks,
   written in the form of a dialogue, 1352, opens with a parable,
   describing innumerable fishes swimming down from the lakes among the
   hills through the streams in the valleys into the deep sea. The author
   then sees them attempting to find their way back to the hills. These
   processes illustrate the career of human souls departing from God into
   the world and seeking to return to Him. The author also sees a
   "fearfully high mountain," on which are nine rocks. The souls that
   succeed in getting back to the mountain are so few that it seemed as if
   only one out of every thousand reached it. He then proceeds to set
   forth the condition of the eminent of the earth, popes and kings,
   cardinals and princes; and also priests, monks and nuns, Beguines and
   Beghards, and people of all sorts and classes. He finds the conditions
   very bad, and is specially severe on women who, by their show of dress
   and by their manners, are responsible for men going morally astray and
   falling into sin. Many of these women commit a hundred mortal sins a
   day.

   Rulman then returns to the nine rocks, which represent the nine stages
   of progress towards the source of our being, God. Those who are on the
   rocks have escaped the devil's net, and by climbing on up to the last
   rock, they reach perfection. Those on the fifth rock have gained the
   point where they have completely given up their own self-will. The
   sixth rock represents full submission to God. On the ninth the number
   is so small that there seemed to be only three persons on it. These
   have no desire whatever except to honor God, fear not hell nor
   purgatory, nor enemy nor death nor life.

   The Friends of God, who are bent on something more than their own
   salvation, are depicted in the valley below, striving to rescue souls
   from the net in which they have been ensnared. The Brethren of the Free
   Spirit resist this merciful procedure.

   The presentation is crude, and Scripture is not directly quoted. The
   biblical imagery, however, abounds, and, as in the case of the ancient
   allegory of Hermas, the principles of the Gospel are set forth in a way
   adapted, no doubt, to reach a certain class of minds, even as in these
   modern days the methods of the Salvation Army appeal to many for whom
   the discourses of Bernard or Gerson might have little meaning. [493]

   Rulman Merswin is regarded by Denifle, Strauch and other critics as the
   author of the works ascribed to the Friend of God from the Oberland,
   and the inventor of this fictitious personage. [494] The reason for
   this view is that no one else knows of the Oberlander and that, after
   Rulman's death, attempts on the part of the Strassburg brotherhood to
   find him, or to find out something about him, resulted in failure. On
   the other hand, it is difficult to understand why Rulman did not
   continue to keep his writings secret till after his own death, if the
   Oberlander was a fictitious character. [495]

   Whatever may be the outcome of the discussion over the historic
   personality of the man from the Oberland, we have in the writings of
   these two men a witness to the part laymen were taking in the affairs
   of the Church.

   consideration is emphasized, that is, the resemblance between Nicolas'
   handwriting and the script of the reputed Oberlander.

   § 33. John of Ruysbroeck.

   Independent of the Friends of God, and yet closely allied with them in
   spirit, was Jan von Ruysbroeck, 1293-1381. In 1350, he sent to the
   Friends in Strassburg his Adornment of the Spiritual
   Marriage--Chierheit der gheesteleker Brulocht. He forms a connecting
   link between them and the Brothers of the Common Life. The founder of
   the latter brotherhood, de Groote, and also Tauler, visited him. He was
   probably acquainted with Eckart's writings, which were current in the
   Lowlands. [496]

   The Flemish mystic was born in a village of the same name near
   Brussels, and became vicar of St. Gudula in that city. At sixty he
   abandoned the secular priesthood and put on the monastic habit,
   identifying himself with the recently established Augustinian convent
   Groenendal,--Green Valley,--located near Waterloo. Here he was made
   prior. Ruysbroeck spent most of his time in contemplation, though he
   was not indifferent to practical duties. On his walks through the woods
   of Soignes, he believed he saw visions and he was otherwise the subject
   of revelations. He was not a man of the schools. Soon after his death,
   a fellow-Augustinian wrote his biography, which abounds in the
   miraculous element. The very trees under which he sat were illuminated
   with an aureole. At his passing away, the bells of the convent rang
   without hands touching them, and perfume proceeded from his dead body.

   The title, doctor ecstaticus, which at an early period was associated
   with Ruysbroeck, well names his characteristic trait. He did not
   speculate upon the remote theological themes of God's being as did
   Eckart, nor was he a popular preacher of every-day Christian living,
   like Tauler. He was a master of the contemplative habit, and mused upon
   the soul's experiences in its states of partial or complete union with
   God. His writings, composed in his mother-tongue, were translated into
   Latin by his pupils, Groote and William Jordaens. The chief products of
   his pen are the Adornment of the Spiritual Marriage, the Mirror of
   Blessedness and Samuel, which is a defence of the habit of
   contemplation, and the Glistening Stone, an allegorical meditation on
   the white stone of Rev. 2:17, which is interpreted to mean Christ.

   Ruysbroeck laid stress upon ascetic exercises, but more upon love. In
   its highest stages of spiritual life, the soul comes to God "without an
   intermediary." The name and work of Christ are dwelt upon on every
   page. He is our canon, our breviary, our every-day book, and belongs to
   Laity and clergy alike. He was concerned to have it understood that he
   has no sympathy with pantheism, and opposed the heretical views of the
   Brethren of the Free Spirit and the Beghards. He speaks of four sorts
   of heretics, the marks of one of them being that they despise the
   ordinances and sacraments of the Catholic Church, the Scriptures and
   the sufferings of Christ, and set themselves above God himself. He,
   however, did not escape the charge of heresy. Gerson, who received a
   copy of the Spiritual Marriage from a Carthusian monk of Bruges, found
   the third book teaching pantheism, and wrote a tract in which he
   complained that the author, whom he pronounced an unlearned man,
   followed his feelings in setting forth the secrets of the religious
   life. Gerson was, however, persuaded that he had made a mistake by the
   defence written by John of Schoenhofen, one of the brethren of
   Groenendal. However, in his reply written 1408, he again emphasized
   that Ruysbroeck was a man without learning, and complained that he had
   not made his meaning sufficiently clear. [497]

   The Spiritual Marriage, Ruysbroeck's chief contribution to mystical
   literature, is a meditation upon the words of the parable, "Behold, the
   bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet him." It sets forth three stages
   of Christian experience, the active, the inner and the contemplative.
   In the active stage the soul adopts the Christian virtues and practises
   them, fighting against sin, and thus it goes out "to meet the
   bridegroom." We must believe the articles of the Creed, but not seek to
   fully understand them. And the more subtle doctrines of the Scripture
   we should accept and explain as they are interpreted by the life of
   Christ and the lives of his saints. Man should study nature, the
   Scriptures and all created things, and draw from them profit. To
   understand Christ he must, like Zaccheus, run ahead of all the
   manifestations of the creature world, and climb up the tree of faith,
   which has twelve branches, the twelve articles of the Creed.

   As for the inner life, it is distinguished from the active by devotion
   to the original Cause and to truth itself as against devotion to
   exercises and forms, to the celebration of the sacrament and to good
   works. Here the soul separates itself from outward relations and
   created forms, and contemplates the eternal love of God. Asceticism may
   still be useful, but it is not essential.

   The contemplative stage few reach. Here the soul is transferred into a
   purity and brightness which is above all natural intelligence. It is a
   peculiar adornment and a heavenly crown. No one can reach it by
   learning and intellectual subtlety nor by disciplinary exercises. In
   order to attain to it, three things are essential. A man must live
   virtuously; he must, like a fire that never goes out, love God
   constantly, and he must lose himself in the darkness in which men of
   the contemplative habit no longer find their way by the methods known
   to the creature. In the abyss of this darkness a light incomprehensible
   is begotten, the Son of God, in whom we "see eternal life."

   At last the soul comes into essential unity with God, and, in the
   fathomless ocean of this unity, all things are seized with bliss. It is
   the dark quiet in which all who love God lose themselves. Here they
   swim in the wild waves of the ocean of God's being. [498]

   He who would follow the Flemish mystic in these utterances must have
   his spirit. They seem far removed from the calm faith which leaves even
   the description of such ecstatic states to the future, and is content
   with doing the will of God in the daily avocations of this earthly
   life. Expressions he uses, such as "spiritual intoxication," [499] are
   not safe, and the experiences he describes are, as he declares, not
   intended for the body of Christian people to reach here below. In most
   men they would take the forms of spiritual hysteria and the
   hallucinations of hazy self-consciousness. It is well that Ruysbroeck's
   greatest pupil, de Groote, did not follow along this line of
   meditation, but devoted himself to practical questions of every-day
   living and works of philanthropy. The ecstatic mood is characteristic
   of this mystic in the secluded home in Brabant, but it is not the
   essential element in his religious thought. His descriptions of Christ
   and his work leave little to be desired. He does not dwell upon Mary,
   or even mention her in his chief work. He insists upon the works which
   proceed from genuine love to God. The chapter may be closed with two
   quotations:--

   "Even devotion must give way to a work of love to the spiritual and to
   the physical man. For even should one rise in prayer higher than Peter
   or Paul, and hear that a poor man needed a drink of water, he would
   have to cease from the devotional exercise, sweet though it were, and
   do the deed of love. It is well pleasing to God that we leave Him in
   order to help His members. In this sense the Apostle was willing to be
   banished from Christ for his brethren's sake."

   "Always before thou retire at night, read three books, which thou
   oughtest always to have with thee. The first is an old, gray, ugly
   volume, written over with black ink. The second is white and
   beautifully written in red, and the third in glittering gold letters.
   First read the old volume. That means, consider thine own past life,
   which is full of sins and errors, as are the lives of all men. Retire
   within thyself and read the book of conscience, which will be thrown
   open at the last judgment of Christ. Think over how badly thou hast
   lived, how negligent thou hast been in thy words, deeds, wishes and
   thoughts. Cast down thy eyes and cry, 'God be merciful to me a sinner.'
   Then God will drive away fear and anxious concern and will give thee
   hope and faith. Then lay the old book aside and go and fetch from
   memory the white book. This is the guileless life of Christ, whose soul
   was pure and whose guileless body was bruised with stripes and marked
   with rose-red, precious blood. These are the letters which show his
   real love to us. Look at them with deep emotion and thank him that, by
   his death, he has opened to thee the gate of heaven. And finally lift
   up thine eyes on high and read the third book, written in golden
   script; that is, consider the glory of the life eternal, in Comparison
   with which the earthly vanishes away as the light of the candle before
   the splendor of the sun at midday." [500]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [496] The extent to which Eckart influenced the mystics of the Lowlands
   is a matter of dispute. The clergy strove to keep his works from
   circulation. Langenberg, p. 181, quotes Gerherd Zerbold von Zütphen's,
   d. 1398, tract, De libris Teutonicalibus which takes the position that,
   while wholesome books might be read in the vulgar tongue, Eckart's
   works and sermons were exceedingly pernicious, and not to be read by
   the laity. Langenberg, pp. 184-204, gives descriptions and excerpts
   from four MSS. of Eckart's writings in Low German, copied in the
   convent of Nazareth, near Bredevoorde, and now preserved in the royal
   library of Berlin, but they do not give Eckart as the author.

   [497] Engelhardt, pp. 265-297, gives a full statement of the
   controversy. For Gerson's letters to Bartholomew and Schoenhofen and

   § 34. Gerrit de Groote and the Brothers of the Common Life.

   It was fortunate for the progress of religion, that mysticism in
   Holland and Northwestern Germany did not confine itself to the channel
   into which it had run at Groenendal. In the latter part of the
   fourteenth century, and before Ruysbroeck's death, it associated with
   itself practical philanthropic activities under the leadership of
   Gerrit Groote, 1340-1384, and Florentius Radewyn, 1350-1400, who had
   finished his studies in Prag. They were the founders of the Windesheim
   Congregation and the genial company known as the Brothers of the Common
   Life, called also the Brothers of the New Devotion. To the effort to
   attain to union with God they gave a new impulse by insisting that men
   imitate the conduct of Christ. [501] Originating in Holland, they
   spread along the Rhine and into Central Germany.

   Groote was born at Deventer, where his father had been burgomaster.
   After studying at Paris, he taught at Cologne, and received the
   appointment of canon, enjoying at least two church livings, one at
   Utrecht and one at Aachen. He lived the life of a man of the world
   until he experienced a sudden conversion through the influence of a
   friend, Henry of Kolcar, a Carthusian prior. He renounced his
   ecclesiastical livings and visited Ruysbroeck, being much influenced by
   him. Thomas à Kempis remarks that Groote could say, after his visits to
   Ruysbroeck, "Thy wisdom and knowledge are greater than the report which
   I heard in my own country."

   At forty he began preaching. Throngs gathered to hear him in the
   churches and churchyards of Deventer, Zwolle, Leyden and other chief
   towns of the Lowlands. [502] Often he preached three times a day. His
   success stirred up the Franciscans, who secured from the bishop of
   Utrecht an inhibition of preaching by laymen. Groote came under this
   restriction, as he was not ordained. An appeal was made to Urban VI.,
   but the pope put himself on the side of the bishop. Groote died in
   1384, before the decision was known.

   Groote strongly denounced the low morals of the clergy, but seems not
   to have opposed any of the doctrines of the Church. He fasted, attended
   mass, laid stress upon prayer and alms, and enforced these lessons by
   his own life. To quote an old writer, he taught by living
   righteously--docuit sancte vivendo. In 1374, he gave the house he had
   inherited from his father at Deventer as a home for widows and
   unmarried women. Without taking vows, the inmates were afforded an
   opportunity of retirement and a life of religious devotion and good
   works. They were to support themselves by weaving, spinning, sewing,
   nursing and caring for the sick. They were at liberty to leave the
   community whenever they chose. John Brinkerinck further developed the
   idea of the female community.

   The origin of the Brothers of the Common Life was on this wise. After
   the inhibition of lay preaching, Groote settled down at Deventer,
   spending much time in the house of Florentius Radewyn. He had employed
   young priests to copy manuscripts. At Radewyn's suggestion they were
   united into a community, and agreed to throw their earnings into a
   common fund. After Groote's death, the community received a more
   distinct organization through Radewyn. Other societies were established
   after the model of the Deventer house, which was called "the rich
   brother house,"--het rijke fraterhuis,--as at Zwolle, Delft, Liége,
   Ghent, Cologne, Münster, Marburg and Rostock, many of them continuing
   strong till the Reformation. [503]

   A second branch from the same stock, the canons Regular of St.
   Augustine, established by the influence of Radewyn and other friends
   and pupils of Groote, had as their chief houses Windesheim, dedicated
   1387, and Mt. St. Agnes, near Zwolle. These labored more within the
   convent, the Brothers of the Common Life outside of it.

   The Brotherhood of the Common Life never reached the position of an
   order sanctioned by Church authority. Its members, including laymen as
   well as clerics, took no irrevocable vow, and were at liberty to
   withdraw when they pleased. They were opposed to the Brethren of the
   Free Spirit, and were free from charges of looseness in morals and
   doctrine. Like their founder, they renounced worldly goods and remained
   unmarried. They supported the houses by their own toil. [504]

   To gardening, making clothes and other occupations pertaining to the
   daily life, they added preaching, conducting schools and copying
   manuscripts. Groote was an ardent lover of books, and had many
   manuscripts copied for his library. Among these master copyists was
   Thomas à Kempis. Classical authors as well as writings of the Fathers
   and books of Scripture were transcribed. Selections were also made from
   these authors in distinct volumes, called ripiaria -- little river
   banks. At Liege they were so diligent as copyists as to receive the
   name Broeders van de penne, Brothers of the Quill. Of Groote, Thomas à
   Kempis reports that he had a chest filled with the best books standing
   near his dining table, so that, if a course did not please him, he
   might reach over to them and give his friends a cup for their souls. He
   carried books about with him on his preaching tours. Objection was here
   and there made to the possession of so many books, where they might
   have been sold and the proceeds given to the poor. [505] Translations
   also were made of the books of Scripture and other works. Groote
   translated the Seven Penitential Psalms, the Office for the Dead and
   certain Devotions to Mary. The houses were not slow in adopting type,
   and printing establishments are mentioned in connection with Maryvale,
   near Geissenheim, Windesheim, Herzogenbusch, Rostock, Louvaine and
   other houses.

   The schools conducted by the Brothers of the Common Life, intended
   primarily for clerics, have a distinguished place in the history of
   education. Seldom, if ever before, had so much attention been paid to
   the intellectual and moral training of youth. Not only did the
   Brothers, have their own schools. They labored also in schools already
   established. Long lists of the teachers are still extant. Their school
   at Herzogenbusch had at one time 1200 scholars, and put Greek into its
   course at its very start, 1424. The school at Liége in 1524 had 1600
   scholars. [506] The school at Deventer acquired a place among the
   notable grammar schools of history, and trained Nicolas of Cusa, Thomas
   à Kempis, John Wessel and Erasmus, who became an inmate of the
   institution, 1474, and learned Greek from one of its teachers, Synthis.
   Making the mother-tongue the chief vehicle of education, these schools
   sent out the men who are the fathers of the modern literature of
   Northwestern Germany and the Lowlands, and prepared the soil for the
   coming Reformation.

   Scarcely less influential was the public preaching of the Brethren in
   the vernacular, and the collations, or expositions of Scripture, given
   to private circles in their own houses. Groote went to the Scriptures,
   so Thomas à Kempis says, as to a well of life. Of John Celle, d. 1417,
   the zealous rector of the Zwolle school, the same biographer writes:
   "He frequently expounded to the pupils the Holy Scriptures, impressing
   upon them their authority and stirring them up to diligence in writing
   out the sayings of the saints. He also taught them to sing accurately,
   and sedulously to attend church, to honor God's ministers and to pray
   often." [507] Celle himself played on the organ.

   The central theme of their study was the person and life of Christ.
   "Let the root of thy study," said Groote, "and the mirror of thy life
   be primarily the Gospel, for therein is the life of Christ portrayed."
   [508] A period of each day was set apart for reflection on some special
   religious subject,--Sunday on heaven, Monday on death, Tuesday on the
   mercies of God, Wednesday on the last judgment, Thursday on the pains
   of hell, Friday on the Lord's passion and Saturday on sins. They laid
   more stress upon inward purity and rectitude than upon outward
   conformities to ritual. [509]

   The excellent people joined the other mystics of the fourteenth century
   in loosening the hold of scholasticism and sacerdotalism, those two
   master forces of the Middle Ages. [510] They gave emphasis to the ideas
   brought out strongly from other quarters,--the heretical sects and such
   writers as Marsiglius of Padua,--the idea of the dignity of the layman,
   and that monastic vows are not the condition of pure religious
   devotion. They were the chief contributors to the vigorous religious
   current which was flowing through the Lowlands. Popular religious
   literature was in circulation. Manuals of devotion were current,
   cordials and praecordials for the soul's needs. Written codes of rules
   for laymen were passed from hand to hand, giving directions for their
   conduct at home and abroad. Religious poems in the vernacular, such as
   the poem on the wise and foolish virgins, carried biblical truth.


   Van viff juncfrou wen de wis weren

   Unde van vif dwasen wilt nu hir leren.

   Some of these were translations from Bernard's Jesu dulcis memoria, and
   some condemned festivities like the Maypole and the dance. [511]

   Eugene IV., Pius II., and Sistus IV. gave the Brothers marks of their
   approval, and the great teachers, Cardinal Cusa, D'Ailly and John
   Gerson spoke in their praise. There were, however, detractors, such as
   Grabon, a Saxon Dominican who presented, in the last days of the
   Council of Constance, 1418, no less than twenty-five charges against
   them. The substance of the charges was that the highest religious life
   may not be lived apart from the orders officially sanctioned by the
   Church. A commission appointed by Martin V., to which Gerson and
   D'Ailly belonged, reported adversely, and Grabon was obliged to
   retract. The commission adduced the fact that there was no monastic
   body in Jerusalem when the primitive Church practised community of
   goods, and that conventual walls and vows are not essential to the
   highest religious life. Otherwise the pope, the cardinals and the
   prelates themselves would not be able to attain to the highest reach of
   religious experience. [512]

   With the Reformation, the distinct mission of the Brotherhood was at an
   end, and many of the communities fell in with the new movement. As for
   the houses which maintained their old rules, Luther felt a warm
   interest in them. When, in 1532, the Council of Hervord in Westphalia
   was proposing to abolish the local sister and brother houses, the
   Reformer wrote strongly against the proposal as follows: "Inasmuch as
   the Brothers and Sisters, who were the first to start the Gospel among
   you, lead a creditable life, and have a decent and well-behaved
   community, and faithfully teach and hold the pure Word, such
   monasteries and brother-houses please me beyond measure." On two other
   occasions, he openly showed his interest in the brotherhood of which
   Groote was the founder. [513]

   [501] See Grube, Gerh. Groot, p. 9; Langenberg, p. ix; Pastor, I. 150.
   The Latin titles of the brotherhood were fratres vitae communis,
   fratres modernae devotionis, fratres bonae voluntatis, with reference
   to Luke 11:14, and fratres collationari with reference to their habit
   of preaching. Groote's name is spelled Geert de Groote, Gherd de Groet
   (Langenberg, p. 3), Gerhard Groot (Grube), etc.

   [502] The title, hammer of the heretics,--malleus hereticorum,--was
   applied to him for his defence of the orthodox teaching. For the
   application of this expression, see Hansen, Gesch. des Hexenwahns, p.
   361. On Groote's fame as a preacher, see Grube, p. 14 sqq., 23. Thomas
   à Kempis vouches for Groote's popularity as a preacher. See Kettlewell,
   I. 130-134. Among his published sermons is one against the concubinage
   of the clergy--de focaristis. For a list of his printed discourses, see
   Herzog, VII., 692 sqq., and Langenberg, p. 35 sqq.

   [503] See Grube, p. 88, and Schulze, p. 492 sqq., who gives a succinct

   [504] Writing of Radewyn, Thomas à Kempis, Vita Florentii, ch. XIV.,
   says that work was most profitable to spiritual advancement, and
   adapted to hold in check the lusts of the flesh. One brother who was
   found after his death to be in possession of some money, was denied
   prayer at his burial.

   [510] See Ullman, II. 82, 115 sq. Schulze, p. 190, is not so clear on

   [511] See Langenberg. The poem he gives on the dance, 68 sqq., begins--
   Hyr na volget eyn lere schone Teghen dantzen unde van den meybome. Here
   follows a nice teaching against dancing and the May tree. One reason
   given against dancing was that the dancers stretched out their arms,
   and so showed disrespect to Christ, who stretched out his arms on the
   cross. One of the documents is a letter in which a monk warns his
   niece, who had gone astray, against displays of dress and bold

   § 35. The Imitation of Christ. Thomas à Kempis.

   ... mild saint


   À Kempis overmild.

   --Lanier.

   The pearl of all the mystical writings of the German-Dutch school is
   the Imitation of Christ, the work of Thomas à Kempis. With the
   Confessions of St. Augustine and Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress it
   occupies a place in the very front rank of manuals of devotion, and, if
   the influence of books is to be judged by their circulation, this
   little volume, starting from a convent in the Netherlands, has, next to
   the Sacred Scriptures, been the most influential of all the religious
   writings of Christendom. Protestants and Catholics alike have joined in
   giving it praise. The Jesuits introduced it into their Exercises. Dr.
   Samuel Johnson, once, when ill, taught himself Dutch by reading it in
   that language, and said of its author that the world had opened its
   arms to receive his book. [514] It was translated by John Wesley, was
   partly instrumental in the conversion of John Newton, was edited by
   Thomas Chalmers, was read by Mr. Gladstone "as a golden book for all
   times" and was the companion of General Gordon. Dr. Charles Hodge, the
   Presbyterian divine, said it has diffused itself like incense through
   the aisles and alcoves of the Universal Church. [515]

   The number of counted editions exceeds 2000. The British Museum has
   more than 1000 editions on its shelves. [516]

   Originally written in the Latin, a French translation was made as early
   as 1447, which still remains in manuscript. The first printed French
   copies appeared in Toulouse, 1488. The earliest German translation was
   made in 1434 and is preserved in Cologne, and printed editions in
   German begin with the Augsburg edition of 1486. Men eminent in the
   annals of German piety, such as Arndt, 1621, Gossner, 1824, and
   Tersteegen, 1844, have issued editions with prefaces. The work first
   appeared in print in English, 1502, the translation being partly by the
   hand of Margaret, the mother of Henry VII. Translations appeared in
   Italian in Venice and Milan, 1488, in Spanish at Seville, 1536, in
   Arabic at Rome, 1663, in Arminian at Rome, 1674, and in other
   languages. [517]

   The Imitation of Christ consists of four books, and derives its title
   from the heading of the first book, De imitatione Christi et contemptu
   omnium vanitatum mundi, the imitation of Christ and the contempt of all
   the vanities of the world. It seems to have been written in metre.
   [518] The four books are not found in all the manuscripts nor
   invariably arranged in the same order, facts which have led some to
   suppose that they were not all written at the same time. The work is a
   manual of devotion intended to help the soul in its communion with God.
   Its sententious statements are pitched in the highest key of Christian
   experience. Within and through all its reflections runs the word,
   self-renunciation. Its opening words, "whoso followeth me, shall not
   walk in darkness but shall have the light of life," John 8:12, are a
   fitting announcement of the contents. The life of Christ is represented
   as the highest study it is possible for a mortal to take up. He who has
   his spirit has found the hidden manna. What can the world confer
   without Jesus? To be without him is the direst hell; to be with him,
   the sweetest paradise.

   Here are counsels to read the Scriptures, statements about the uses of
   adversity and advice for submission to authority, warnings against
   temptations, reflections upon death, the judgment and paradise. Here
   are meditations on Christ's oblation on the cross and the advantages of
   the communion, and also admonitions to flee the vanities and emptiness
   of the world and to love God, for he that loveth, knoweth God. Christ
   is more than all the wisdom of the schools. He lifts up the mind in a
   moment of time to perceive more reasons for eternal truth than a
   student might learn over books in ten years. He teaches without
   confusion of words, without the clashing of opinions, without the pride
   of reputation,--sine fastu honoris,--the contention of arguments. The
   concluding words are: "My eyes are unto Thee. My God, in Thee do I put
   my trust, O Thou Father of mercies. Accompany thy servant with Thy
   grace and direct him by the path of peace to the land of unending
   light--patriam perpetuae claritatis."

   The plaintive minor key, the gently persuasive tone of the work are
   adapted to attract serious souls seeking the inner chamber of religious
   peace and purity of thought, but especially those who are under the
   shadow of pain and sorrow. The praise of Christ is so unstinted, and
   the dependence upon him so unaffected, that one cannot help but feel,
   in reading this book, that he is partaking of the essence of the
   Gospel. The work, however, presents only one side of the Christian
   life. It commends humility, submission, gentleness and the passive
   virtues. It does not emphasize the manly virtues of courage and loyalty
   to the truth, nor elaborate upon Christian activities to be done to our
   fellow-men. To fall in completely with the spirit of Thomas à Kempis,
   and to abide there, would mean to follow the best cloistral ideal of
   the Middle Ages, or rather of the fourteenth century. Its counsels and
   reflections were meant primarily for those who had made the convent
   their home, not for the busy traffickers in the marts of the world, and
   in association with men of all classes. It leans to quietism, and is
   calculated to promote personal piety for those who dwell much alone
   rather than to fit men for engaging in the public battles which fall to
   men's usual lot. Its admonitions are adapted to help men to bear with
   patience rather than to rectify the evils in the world, to be silent
   rather than to speak to the throng, to live well in seclusion rather
   than set an example of manly and womanly endeavor in the shop, on the
   street and in the family. The charge has been made, and not without
   some ground, that the Imitation of Christ sets forth a selfish type of
   religion. [519] Its soft words are fitted to quiet the soul and bring
   it to meek contentment rather than to stir up the combatant virtues of
   courage and of assistance to others. Its message corresponds to the
   soft glow of the summer evening, and not to the fresh hours filled with
   the rays of the morning sun. This plaintive note runs through Thomas'
   hymns, as may be seen from a verse taken from "The Misery of this Life"
   :--


   Most wonderful would it be

   If one did not feel and lament

   That in this world to live

   Is toil, affliction, pain. [520]

   Over the pages of the book is written the word Christ. It is for this
   reason that Protestants cherish it as well as Catholics. The references
   to mediaeval errors of doctrine or practice are so rare that it
   requires diligent search to find them. Such as they are, they are
   usually erased from English editions, so that the English reader misses
   them entirely. Thomas introduces the merit of good works,
   transubstantiation, IV. 2, the doctrine of purgatory, IV. 9, and the
   worship of saints, I. 13, II. 9, II. 6, 59. But these statements,
   however, are like the flecks on the marbles of the Parthenon.

   The author, Thomas à Kempis, 1380-1471, was born in Kempen, a town 40
   miles northwest of Cologne, and died at Zwolle, in the Netherlands. His
   paternal name was Hemerken or Hämmerlein, Little Hammer. He was a
   follower of Groote. In 1395, he was sent to the school of Deventer,
   under the charge of Florentius Radewyn and the Brothers of the Common
   Life. He became skilful as a copyist, and was thus enabled to support
   himself. Later he was admitted to the Augustinian convent of Mt. St.
   Agnes, near Zwolle, received priest's orders, 1413, and was made
   sub-prior, 1429. His brother John, a man of rectitude of life, had been
   there before him, and was prior. Thomas' life seems to have been a
   quiet one, devoted to meditation, composition and copying. He copied
   the Bible no less than four times, one of the copies being preserved at
   Darmstadt. His works abound in quotations of the New Testament. Under
   an old picture, which is represented as his portrait, are the words,
   "In all things I sought quiet, and found it not save in retirement and
   in books." [521] They fit well the author of the famous Imitation of
   Christ, as the world thinks of him. He reached the high age of
   fourscore years and ten. A monument was dedicated to his memory in the
   presence of the archbishop of Utrecht in St. Michael's Church Zwolle,
   Nov. 11, 1897. The writings of à Kempis, which are all of a devotional
   character, include tracts and meditations, letters, sermons, a Life of
   St. Lydewigis, a steadfast Christian woman who endured a great fight of
   afflictions, and the biographies of Groote, Florentius and nine of
   their companions. Works similar to the are his prolonged meditation
   upon the Incarnation, and a meditation on the Life and Blessings of the
   Saviour, [522] both of which overflow with admiration for Christ.

   In these writings the traces of mediaeval theology, though they are
   found, are not obtrusive. The writer followed his mediaeval
   predecessors in the worship of Mary, of whom he says, she is to be
   invoked by all Christians, especially by monastics. [523] He prays to
   her as the "most merciful," the "most glorious" mother of God, and
   calls her the queen of heaven, the efficient mediatrix of the whole
   world, the joy and delight of all the saints, yea, the golden couch for
   all the saints. She is the chamber of God, the gate of heaven, the
   paradise of delights, the well of graces, the glory of the angels, the
   joy of men, the model of manners, the brightness of virtues, the lamp
   of life, the hope of the needy, the salvation of the weak, the mother
   of the orphaned. To her all should flee as sons to a mother's bosom.
   [524]

   From these tender praises of Mary it is pleasant to turn away to the
   code of twenty-three precepts which the Dutch mystic laid down under
   the title, A Small Alphabet for a Monk in the School of God. [525] Here
   are some of them. Love to be unknown and to be reputed as nothing. Love
   solitude and silence, and thou wilt find great quiet and a good
   conscience. Where the crowd is, there is usually confusion and
   distraction of heart. Choose poverty and simplicity. Humble thyself in
   all things and under all things, and thou wilt merit kindness from all.
   Let Christ be thy life, thy reading, thy meditation, thy conversation,
   thy desire, thy gain, thy hope and thy reward. Zaccheus, brother,
   descend from the height of thy secular wisdom. Come and learn in God's
   school the way of humility, long-suffering and patience, and Christ
   teaching thee, thou shalt come at last safely to the glory of eternal
   beatitude.

   NOTE. - The Authorship of the Imitation of Christ. This question has
   been one of the most hotly contested questions in the history of pure
   literature. National sentiments have entered into the discussion,
   France and Italy contending for the honor of authorship with the
   Lowlands. The work is now quite generally ascribed to Thomas à Kempis,
   but among those who dissent from this opinion are scholars of rank.

   Among the more recent treatments of the subject not given in the
   Literature, § 27, are V. Becker: L'auteur de l'Imitat. et les documents
   néerlandais, Hague, 1882. Also Les derniers travaux sur l'auteur de

   Thomas, in Brieger's Zeitschrift, 1902, 18 sqq., 1903, 594 sqq.

   Pohl gives a list of no less than 35 persons to whom with more or less
   confidence the authorship has been ascribed. The list includes the
   names of John Gerson, chancellor of the University of Paris; John
   Gersen, the reputed abbot of Vercelli, Italy, who lived about 1230;
   Walter Hylton, St. Bernard, Bonaventura, David of Augsburg, Tauler,
   Suso and even Innocent III. The only claimants worthy of consideration
   are Gerson, Gersen, and Thomas à Kempis, although Montmorency is
   inclined to advance the claim of Walter Hylton. The uncertainty arises
   from the facts (1) that a number of the MSS. and printed editions of
   the fifteenth century have no note of authorship; (2) the rest are
   divided between these, Gerson, Gersen, à Kempis, Hylton, and St.
   Bernard; (3) the MSS. copies show important divergencies. The matter
   has been made more difficult by the forgery of names and dates in MSS.
   since the controversy began, these forgeries being almost entirely in
   the interest of a French or Italian authorship. A reason for the
   absence of the author's name in so many MSS. is found in the desire of
   à Kempis, if he indeed be the author, to remain incognito, in
   accordance with his own motto, ama nesciri, "love to be unknown."

   Of the Latin editions belonging to the fifteenth century, Pohl gives 28
   as accredited to Gerson, 12 to Thomas, 2 to St. Bernard, and 6 as
   anonymous. Or, to follow Funk, p. 426, 40 editions of that century were
   ascribed to Gerson, 11 to à Kempis, 2 to Bernard, 1 to Gersen, and 2
   are anonymous. Spitzen gives 16 as ascribed to à Kempis. Most of the
   editions ascribing the work to Gerson were printed in France, the
   remaining editions being printed in Italy or Spain. The editions of the
   sixteenth century show a change, 37 Latin editions ascribing the
   authorship to à Kempis, and 25 to Gerson. As for the MSS. dated before
   1460, and whose dates may be said to be reasonably above suspicion, all
   were written in Germany and the Lowlands. The oldest, included in a
   codex preserved since 1826 in the royal library of Brussels, probably
   belongs before 1420. The codex contains 9 other writings of à Kempis
   besides the Imitation, and contains the note, Finitus et completus
   MCCCCXLI per manus fratris Th. Kempensis in Monte S. Agnetis prope
   Zwollis (finished and completed, 1441, by the hands of brother Thomas à
   Kempis of Mount St. Agnes, near Zwolle). See Pohl, II. 461 sqq. So this
   is an autographic copy. The text of the Imitation, however, is written
   on older paper than the other documents, and has corrections which are
   found in a Dutch translation of the first book, dating from 1420. For
   these reasons, Funk, p. 424, and others, puts the MS. back to
   1416-1420.

   The literary controversy over the authorship began in 1604, when Dom
   Pedro Manriquez, in a work on the Lord's Supper issued at Milan, and on
   the alleged basis of a quotation by Bonaventura, declared the Imitation
   to be older than that Schoolman. In 1606, Bellarmin, in his Descript.
   eccles., was more precise, and stated it was already in existence in
   1260. About the same time, the Jesuit, Rossignoli, found in a convent
   at Arona, near Milan, a MS. without date, but bearing the name of an
   abbot, John Gersen, as its author; the house had belonged to the
   Benedictines once. In 1614 the Benedictine, Constantius Cajetan,
   secretary of Paul V., issued his Gersen restitutus at Rome, and later
   his Apparatus ad Gersenem restitutum, in which he defended the
   Italian's claim. This individual was said to have been a Benedectine
   abbot of Vercelli, in Piedmont, in the first half of the thirteenth
   century. On the other hand, the Augustinian, Rosweyde, in his vindiciae
   Kempenses, Antwerp, 1617, so cogently defended the claims of à Kempis
   that Bellarmin withdrew his statement. In the nineteenth century the
   claims of Gersen were again urged by a Piedmontese nobleman, Gregory,
   in his Istoria della Vercellese letteratura, Turin, 1819, and
   subsequent publications, and by Wolfsgruber of Vienna in a scholarly
   work, 1880. But Hirsche and Funk are, no doubt, right in pronouncing
   the name Gersen a mistake for Gerson, and Funk, after careful
   criticism, declares the Italian abbot a fictitious personage. The most
   recent Engl. writer on the subject, Montmorency, p. xiii. says, "there
   is no evidence that there was ever an abbot of Vercelli by the name of
   Gersen."

   The claims of John Gerson are of a substantial character, and France
   was not slow in coming to the chancellor's defence. An examination of
   old MSS., made in Paris, had an uncertain issue, so that, in 1640,
   Richelieu's splendid edition of the Imitation was sent forth without an
   author's name. The French parliament, however, in 1652, ordered the
   book printed under the name of à Kempis. The matter was not settled
   and, at three gatherings, 1671, 1674, 1687, instituted by Mabillon, a
   fresh examination of MSS. was made, with the result that the case went
   against à Kempis. Later, Du Pin, after a comparison of Gerson's
   writings with the Imitation, concluded that it was impossible to decide
   with certainty between these two writers and Gersen. (See his 2d ed. of
   Gerson's Works, 1728, I. lix-lxxxiv) but in a special work. Amsterdam,
   1706, he had decided in favor of the Dutchman. French editions of the
   Imitation continued to be issued under the name of Gerson, as, for
   example, those of Erhard-Mezler, 1724, and Vollardt, 1758. On the other
   hand, the Augustinian, Amort, defended the à Kempis authorship in his
   Informatio de statu controversiae, Augsburg, 1728, and especially in
   his Scutum Kempense, Cologne, 1728. After the unfavorable statement of
   Schwab, Life of Gerson, 1858, pp. 782-786, declaring that the Imitation
   is in an altogether different style from Gerson's works, the theory of
   the Gerson authorship seemed to be finally abandoned. The first
   collected edition of Gerson's Works, 1483, knows nothing about the
   Imitation. Nor did Gerson's brother, prior of Lyons, mention it in the
   list he gave of the chancellor's works, 1423. The author of the
   Imitation was, by his own statements, a monk, IV. 5, 11; III., 56.
   Gerson would have been obliged to change his usual habit of
   presentation to have written in the monastic tone.

   After the question of authorship seemed to be pretty well settled in
   favor of à Kempis, another stage in the controversy was opened by the
   publications of Puyol in 1898, 1899. Puyol gives a description of 548
   manuscripts, and makes a sharp distinction between those of Italian
   origin and other manuscripts. He also annotates the variations in 57,
   with the conclusion that the Italian text is the more simple, and
   consequently the older and original text. He himself based his edition
   on the text of Arona. Puyol is followed by Kentenich, and has been
   answered by Pohl and others.

   Walter Hylton's reputed authorship of the Imitation is based upon three
   books of that work, having gone under the name De musica ecclesiastica
   in MSS. in England and the persistent English tradition that Hylton was
   the author. Montmorency, pp. xiv, 138-170, while he pronounces the
   Hylton theory of authorship untenable, confesses his inability to
   explain it.

   The arguments in favor of the à Kempis authorship, briefly stated, are
   as follows:--

   1. External testimony. John Busch, in his Chronicon Windesemense,
   written 1464, seven years before à Kempis' death, expressly states that
   à Kempis wrote the Imitation. To this testimony are to be added the
   testimonies of Caspar of Pforzheim, who made a German translation of
   the work, 1448; Hermann Rheyd, who met Thomas, 1454, and John Wessel,
   who was attracted to Windesheim by the book's fame. For other
   testimonies, see Hirsche and Funk, pp. 432-436.

   2. Manuscripts and editions. The number of extant MSS. is about 500.
   See Kentenich, p. 294. Funk, p. 420, gives 13 MSS. dated before 1500,
   ascribing the Imitation to à Kempis. The autograph copy, contained in
   the Brussels codex of 1441, has already been mentioned. It must be
   said, however, the conclusion reached by Hirsche, Pohl, Funk, Schulze
   and others that this text is autographic has been denied by Puyol and
   Kentenich, on the basis of its divergences from other copies, which
   they claim the author could not have made. A second autograph, in
   Louvaine (see Schulze, p. 730), seems to be nearly as old, 1420, and
   has the note scriptus manibus et characteribus Thomae qui est autor
   horum devotorum libellorum, "written by the hand of Thomas," etc.
   (Pohl, VI. 456 sq.). A third MS., stating that Thomas is the author,
   and preserved in Brussels, is dated 1425.--As for the printed editions
   of the fifteenth century, at least 13 present Thomas as the author,
   from the edition of Augsburg, 1472, to the editions of Paris, 1493,
   1500.

   3. Style and contents. These agree closely with à Kempis' other
   writings, and the flow of thought is altogether similar to that of his
   Meditation on Christ's Incarnation. Spitzen seems to have made it at
   least very probable that the author was acquainted with the writings of
   Ruysbroeck, John of Schoenhoven, and other mystics and monks of the
   Lowlands. Funk has brought out references to ecclesiastical customs
   which fit the book into the time between the fourteenth and fifteenth
   centuries. Hirsche laid stress on Germanisms in the style.

   Among recent German scholars, Denifle sets aside à Kempis' claims and
   ascribes the work to some unknown canon regular of the Lowlands. Karl
   Müller, in a brief note, Kirchengesch., II. 122, and Loof's
   Dogmengesch., 4th ed., p. 633, pronounce the à Kempis authorship more
   than doubtful. On the other hand, Schwab, Hirsche, Schulze and Funk
   agree that the claims of Thomas are almost beyond dispute. It is almost
   impossible to give a reason why the Imitation should have been ascribed
   to the Dutch mystic, if he were not indeed its author. The explanation
   given by Kentenich, p. 603, seems to be utterly insufficient.

   § 36. The German Theology.

   The evangelical teachings of the little book, known as The German
   Theology, led Ullmann to place its author in the list of the Reformers
   before the Reformation. [526] The author was one of the Friends of God,
   and no writing issuing from that circle has had a more honorable and
   useful career. Together with the Imitation of Christ, it has been the
   most profitable of the writings of the German mystics. Its fame is
   derived from Luther's high praise as much as from its own excellent
   contents. The Reformer issued two editions of it, 1516, with a partial
   text, and 1518, in the second edition giving it the name which remains
   with it to this day, Ein Deutsch Theologia -- A German treatise of
   Theology. [527] Luther designated as its author a Frankfurt priest, a
   Teutonic knight, but for a time it was ascribed to Tauler. The Preface
   of the oldest MS., dated 1497, and found in 1850, made this view
   impossible, for Tauler is himself quoted in ch. XIII. Here the author
   is called a Frankfurt priest and a true Friend of God.

   Luther announced his high obligation to the teachings of the manual of
   the way of salvation when he said that next to the Bible and St.
   Augustine, no book had come into his hands from which he had learnt
   more of what God and man and all things are and would wish to learn
   more. The author, he affirmed, was a pure Israelite who did not take
   the foam from the surface, but drew from the bed of the Jordan. Here,
   he continued, the teachings of the Scriptures are set forth as plain as
   day which have been lying under the desk of the universities, nay, have
   almost been left to rot in dust and muck. With his usual patriotism, he
   declared that in the book he had found Christ in the German tongue as
   he and the other German theologians had never found him in Greek, Latin
   or Hebrew.

   The German Theology sets forth man's sinful and helpless condition,
   Christ's perfection and mediatorial work and calls upon men to have
   access to God through him as the door. In all its fifty-four chapters
   no reference is made to Mary or to the justifying nature of good works
   or the merit of sacramental observances. [528] It abounds as no other
   writing of the German mystics did in quotations from the New Testament.
   In its pages the wayfaring man may find the path of salvation marked
   out without mystification.

   The book, starting out with the words of St. Paul, "when that which is
   perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away,"
   declares that that which is imperfect has only a relative existence and
   that, whenever the Perfect becomes known by the creature, then "the I,
   the Self and the like must all be given up and done away." Christ shows
   us the way by having taken on him human nature. In chs. XV.-LIV., it
   shows that all men are dead in Adam, and that to come to the perfect
   life, the old man must die and the new man be born. He must become
   possessed with God and depossessed of the devil. Obedience is the prime
   requisite of the new manhood. Sin is disobedience, and the more "of
   Self and Me, the more of sin and wickedness and the more the Self, the
   I, the Me, the Mine, that is, self-seeking and selfishness, abate in a
   man, the more doth God's I, that is, God Himself, increase." By
   obedience we become free. The life of Christ is the perfect model, and
   we follow him by hearkening unto his words to forsake all. This is
   nothing else than saying that we must be in union with the divine will
   and be ready either to do or to suffer. Such a man, a man who is a
   partaker of the divine nature, will in sincerity love all men and
   things, do them good and take pleasure in their welfare. Knowledge and
   light profit nothing without love. Love maketh a man one with God. The
   last word is that no man can come unto the Father but by Christ.

   In 1621 the Catholic Church placed the Theologia Germanica on the
   Index. If all the volumes listed in that catalogue of forbidden books
   were like this one, making the way of salvation plain, its pages would
   be illuminated with ineffable light. [529]

   § 37. English Mystics.

   England, in the fourteenth century, produced devotional writings which
   have been classed in the literature of mysticism. They are wanting in
   the transcendental flights of the German mystics, and are, for the most
   part, marked by a decided practical tendency.

   The Ancren Riwle was written for three sisters who lived as anchoresses
   at Tarrant Kaines, Dorsetshire. [530] It was the custom in their day in
   England for women living a recluse life to build a room against the
   wall of some church or a small structure in a churchyard and in such a
   way that it had windows, but no doors of egress. This little book of
   religious counsels was written at the request of the sisters, and is
   usually ascribed to Simon of Ghent, bishop of Salisbury, d. 1315. The
   author gives two general directions, namely, to keep the heart "smooth
   and without any scar of evil," and to practise bodily discipline, which
   "serveth the first end, and of which Paul said that it profiteth
   little." The first is the lady, the second the handmaid. If asked to
   what order they belonged, the sisters were instructed to say to the
   Order of St. James, for James said, "Pure religion and undefiled before
   our God and Father is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their
   affliction and to keep one's self unspotted from the world." It is
   interesting to note that they are bidden to have warm clothes for bed
   and back, and to wash "as often as they please." They were forbidden to
   lash themselves with a leathern thong, or one loaded with lead except
   at the advice of their confessor. Richard Rolle, d. 1349, the author of
   a number of devotional treatises, and also translations or paraphrases
   of the Psalms, Job, the Canticles and Jeremiah, suddenly left Oxford,
   where he was pursuing his studies, discontented with the scholastic
   method in vogue at the university, and finally settled down as a hermit
   at Hampole, near Doncaster. Here he attained a high fame for piety and
   as a worker of miracles. He wrote in Latin and English, his chief works
   being the Latin treatises, The Emendation of Life and The Fervor of
   Love. They were translated in 1434, 1435, by Rich Misyn. His works are
   extant in many manuscript copies. Rolle exalted the contemplative life,
   indulged in much dreamy religious speculation, but also denounced the
   vice and worldliness of his time. In the last state of the
   contemplative life he represents man as "seeing into heaven with his
   ghostly eye." [531]

   Juliana of Norwich, who died 1443, as it is said, at the age of 100,
   was also an anchoress, having her cell in the churchyard of St.
   Julian's church, Norwich. She received 16 revelations, the first in
   1373, when she was 30 years old. At that time, she saw "God in a
   point." She laid stress upon love, and presented the joyful aspect of
   religion. God revealed Himself to her in three properties, life, light
   and love. Her account of her revelations is pronounced by Inge "a
   fragrant little book." [532]

   The Ladder of Perfection, written by Walter Hylton, an Augustinian
   canon of Thurgarton, Nottinghamshire, who died 1396, [533] depicts the
   different stages of spiritual attainment from the simple knowledge of
   the facts of religion, which is likened to the water of Cana which must
   be turned into wine, to the last stages of contemplation and divine
   union. There is no great excellency, Hylton says, "in watching and
   fasting till thy head aches, nor in running to Rome or Jerusalem with
   bare feet, nor in building churches and hospitals." But it is a sign of
   excellency if a man can love a sinner, while hating the sin. Those who
   are not content with merely saving their souls, but go on to the higher
   degrees of contemplation, are overcome by "a good darkness," a state in
   which the soul is free and not distracted by anything earthly. The
   light then arises little by little. Flashes come through the chinks in
   the walls of Jerusalem, but Jerusalem is not reached by a bound. There
   must be transformation, and the power that transforms is the love of
   God shed abroad in the soul. Love proceeds from knowledge, and the more
   God is known, the more is He loved. Hylton's wide reputation is proved
   by the ascription of Thomas à Kempis' Imitation to him and its
   identification in manuscripts with his De musica ecclesiastica. [534]

   These writings, if we except Rolle, betray much of that sobriety of
   temper which characterizes the English religious thought. They contain
   no flights of hazy mystification and no rapturous outbursts of
   passionate feeling. They emphasize features common to all the mystics
   of the later Middle Ages, the gradual transformation through the power
   of love into the image of God, and ascent through inward contemplation
   to full fellowship with Him. They show that the principles of the
   imitation of Christ were understood on the English side of the channel
   as well as by the mystics of the Lowlands, and that true godliness is
   to be reached in another way than by the mere practice of sacramental
   rites.

   These English pietists are to be regarded, however, as isolated figures
   who, so far as we know, had no influence in preparing the soil for the
   seed of the Reformation that was to come, as had the Pietists who lived
   along the Rhine. [535]

   § 39. The Church in England in the Fourteenth Century.

   The 14th century witnessed greater social changes in England than any
   other century except the 19th. These changes were in large part a
   result of the hundred years' war with France, which began in 1337, and
   the terrible ravages of the Black Death. The century was marked by the
   legal adoption of the English tongue as the language of the country and
   the increased respect for parliament, in whose counsels the rich
   burgher class demanded a voice, and its definite division into two
   houses, 1341. The social unrest of the land found expression in popular
   harangues, poems, and tracts, affirming the rights of the villein and
   serf class, and in the uprising known as the Peasants' Revolt.

   The distinctly religious life of England, in this period, was marked by
   obstinate resistance to the papal claims of jurisdiction, culminating
   in the Acts of Provisors, and by the appearance of John Wyclif, one of
   the most original and vigorous personalities the English Church has
   produced.

   An industrial revolution was precipitated on the island by the Great
   Pestilence of 1348. The necessities of life rose enormously in value.
   Large tracts of land passed back from the smaller tenants into the
   hands of the landowners of the gentry class. The sheep and the cattle,
   as a contemporary wrote, "strayed through the fields and grain, and
   there was no one who could drive them." The serfs and villeins found in
   the disorder of society an opportunity to escape from the yoke of
   servitude, and discovered in roving or in independent engagements the
   joys of a new-found freedom. These unsettled conditions called forth
   the famous statutes of Edward III.'s reign, 1327-1377, regulating wages
   and the prices of commodities.

   The popular discontent arising from these regulations, and from the
   increased taxation necessitated by the wars with France, took the form
   of organized rebellion. The age of feudalism was coming to an end. The
   old ideas of labor and the tiller of the soil were beginning to give
   way before more just modes of thought. Among the agitators were John
   Ball, whom Froissart, with characteristic aristocratic indifference,
   called "the mad priest of Kent," the poet Longland and the insurgent
   leader, Watt Tyler. In his harangues, Ball fired popular feeling by
   appeals to the original rights of man. By what right, he exclaimed,
   "they, who are called lords, greater folk than we? On what grounds do
   they hold us in vassalage? Do not we all come from the same father and
   mother, Adam and Eve?" The spirit of individual freedom breathed itself
   out in the effective rhyme, which ran like wildfire, --


   When Adam delved and Eve span

   Who was then the gentleman?

   The rhymes, which Will Longland sent forth in his Complaint of Piers
   Ploughman, ventilated the sufferings and demands of the day laborer and
   called for fair treatment such as brother has a right to expect from
   brother. Gentleman and villein faced the same eternal destinies.
   "Though he be thine underling," the poet wrote, "mayhap in heaven, he
   will be worthier set and with more bliss than thou." The rising sense
   of national importance and individual dignity was fed by the victory of
   Crécy, 1346, where the little iron balls, used for the first time,
   frightened the horses; by the battle of Poictiers ten years later; by
   the treaty of Brétigny, 1360, whereby Edward was confirmed in the
   possession of large portions of France, and by the exploits of the
   Black Prince. The spectacle of the French king, John, a captive on the
   streets of London, made a deep impression. These events and the
   legalization of the English tongue, 1362, [536] contributed to develop
   a national and patriotic sentiment before unknown in England.

   The uprising, which broke out in 1381, was a vigorous assertion of the
   popular demand for a redress of the social inequalities between classes
   in England. The insurgent bands, which marched to London, were pacified
   by the fair promises of Richard II., but the Kentish band led by Watt
   Tyler, before dispersing, took the Tower and put the primate, Sudbury,
   to death. He had refused to favor the repeal of the hated decapitation
   tax. The abbeys of St. Albans and Edmondsbury were plundered and the
   monks ill treated, but these acts of violence were a small affair
   compared with the perpetual import of the uprising for the social and
   industrial well-being of the English people. The demands of the
   insurgents, as they bore on the clergy, insisted that Church lands and
   goods, after sufficient allowance had been made for the reasonable
   wants of the clergy, should be distributed among the parishioners, and
   that there should be a single bishop for England. This involved a
   rupture with Rome. [537]

   It was inevitable that the Church should feel the effects of these
   changes. Its wealth, which is computed to have covered one-third of the
   landed property of the realm, and the idleness and mendicancy of the
   friars, awakened widespread murmur and discontent. The ravages made
   among the clergy by the Black Death rendered necessary extraordinary
   measures to recruit its ranks. The bishop of Norwich was authorized to
   replace the dead by ordaining 60 young men before the canonical age.
   With the rise of the staples of living, the stipends of the vast body
   of the priestly class was rendered still more inadequate. Archbishop
   Islip of Canterbury and other prelates, while recognizing in their
   pastorals the prevalent unrest, instead of showing proper sympathy,
   condemned the covetousness of the clergy. On the other hand, Longland
   wrote of the shifts to which they were put to eke out a living by
   accepting secular and often menial employment in the royal palace and
   the halls of the gentry class.


   Parson and parish priest pleyned to the bishop,

   That their parishes were pore sith the pestilence tym,

   To have a license and a leve at London to dwelle

   And syngen there for symonye, for silver is swete.

   There was a movement from within the English people to limit the power
   of the bishops and to call forth spirituality and efficiency in the
   clergy. The bishops, powerful as they remained, were divested of some
   of their prestige by the parliamentary decision of 1370, restricting
   high offices of state to laymen. The first lay chancellor was appointed
   in 1340. The bishop, however, was a great personage, and woe to the
   parish that did not make fitting preparations for his entertainment and
   have the bells rung on his arrival. Archbishop Arundel, Foxe quaintly
   says, "took great snuff and did suspend all such as did not receive him
   with the noise of bells." Each diocese had its own prison, into which
   the bishop thrust refractory clerics for penance or severer punishment.

   The mass of the clergy had little learning. The stalls and canonries,
   with attractive incomes, where they did not go to foreigners, were
   regarded as the proper prizes of the younger sons of noblemen. On the
   other hand, the prelates lived in abundance. The famous bishop of
   Winchester, William of Wykeham, counted fifty manors of his own. In the
   larger ones, official residences were maintained, including hall and
   chapel. This prelate travelled from one to the other, taking reckonings
   of his stewards, receiving applications for the tonsure and ordination
   and attending to other official business. Many of the lower clergy were
   taken from the villein class, whose sons required special exemption to
   attend school. The day they received orders they were manumitted.

   The benefit of clergy, so called, continued to be a source of injustice
   to the people at large. By the middle of the 13th century, the Church's
   claim to tithes was extended not only to the products of the field, but
   the poultry of the yard and the cattle of the stall, to the catch of
   fish and the game of the forests. Wills almost invariably gave to the
   priest "the best animal" or the "best quick good." The Church received
   and gave not back, and, in spite of the statute of Mortmain, bequests
   continued to be made to her. It came, however, to be regarded as a
   settled principle that the property of Church and clergy was amenable
   to civil taxation, and bishops, willingly or by compulsion, loaned
   money to the king. The demands of the French campaigns made such
   taxation imperative.

   Indulgences were freely announced to procure aid for the building of
   churches, as in the case of York Cathedral, 1396, the erection of
   bridges, the filling up of muddy roads and for other public
   improvements. The clergy, though denied the right of participating in
   bowling and even in the pastime of checkers, took part in village
   festivities such as the Church-ale, a sort of mediaeval donation party,
   in which there was general merrymaking, ale was brewed, and the people
   drank freely to the health of the priest and for the benefit of the
   Church. As for the morals of the clergy, care must always be had not to
   base sweeping statements upon delinquencies which are apt to be
   emphasized out of proportion to their extent. It is certain, however,
   that celibacy was by no means universally enforced, and frequent
   notices occur of dispensations given to clergymen of illegitimate
   birth. Bishop Quevil of Exeter complained that priests with families
   invested their savings for the benefit of their marital partners and
   their children. In the next period, in 1452, De la Bere, bishop of St.
   David's, by his own statement, drew 400 marks yearly from priests for
   the privilege of having concubines, a noble, equal in value to a mark,
   from each one. [538] Glower, in his Vox clamantis, gave a dark picture
   of clerical habits, and charges the clergy with coarse vices such as
   now are scarcely dreamed of. The Church historian, Capes, concludes
   that "immorality and negligence were widely spread among the clergy."
   [539] The decline of discipline among the friars, and their rude
   manners, a prominent feature of the times, came in for the strictures
   of Fitzralph of Armagh, severe condemnation at the hands of Wyclif and
   playful sarcasm from the pen of Chaucer. The zeal for learning which
   had characterized them on their first arrival in England, early in the
   13th century, had given way to self-satisfied idleness. Fitzralph, who
   was fellow of Balliol, and probably chancellor of the University of
   Oxford, before being raised to the episcopate, incurred the hostility
   of the friars by a series of sermons against the Franciscan theory of
   evangelical poverty. He claimed it was not scriptural nor derived from
   the customs of the primitive Church. For his temerity he was compelled
   to answer at Avignon, where he seems to have died about the year 1360.
   [540] Of the four orders of mendicants, the Franciscans, Dominicans,
   Carmelites and Augustinians, Longland sang that they


   Preached the people for profit and themselve

   Glosed the Gospel as them good lyked,

   For covetis of copis construed it as they would.

   Of the ecclesiastics of the century, if we except Wyclif, probably the
   most noted are Thomas Bradwardine and William of Wykeham, the one the
   representative of scholarly study, the other of ecclesiastical power.
   Bradwardine, theologian, phiIosopher, mathematician and astronomer, was
   a student at Merton College, Oxford, 1325. At Avignon, whither he went
   to receive consecration to the see of Canterbury, 1349, he had a
   strange experience. During the banquet given by Clement VI. the doors
   were thrown open and a clown entered, seated on a jackass, and humbly
   petitioned the pontiff to be made archbishop of Canterbury. This
   insult, gotten up by Clement's nephew Hugo, cardinal of Tudela, and
   other members of the sacred college, was in allusion to the remark made
   by the pope that, if the king of England would ask him to appoint a
   jackass to a bishopric, he would not dare to refuse. The sport throws
   an unpleasant light upon the ideals of the curia, but at the same time
   bears witness to the attempt which was being made in England to control
   the appointment of ecclesiastics. Bradwardine enjoyed such an enviable
   reputation that Wyclif and other English contemporaries gave him the
   title, the Profound Doctor--doctor profundus. [541] In his chief work
   on grace and freewill, delivered as a series of lectures at Merton, he
   declared that the Church was running after Pelagius. [542] In the
   philosophical schools he had rarely heard anything about grace, but all
   day long the assertions that we are masters of our own wills. He was a
   determinist. All things, he affirmed, which occur, occur by the
   necessity of the first cause. In his Nun's Tale, speaking of God's
   predestination, Chaucer says:--


   But he cannot boult it to the bren

   As can the holie doctour, S. Austin,

   Or Boece (Boethius), or the Bishop Bradwardine.

   Wykeham, 1324-1404, the pattern of a worldly and aristocratic prelate,
   was an unblushing pluralist, and his see of Winchester is said to have
   brought him in £60,000 of our money annually. In 1361 alone, he
   received prebends in St. Paul's, Hereford, Salisbury, St. David's,
   Beverley, Bromyard, Wherwell Abergwili, and Llanddewi Brewi, and in the
   following year Lincoln, York, Wells and Hastings. He occupied for a
   time the chief office of chancellor, but fell into disrepute. His
   memory is preserved in Winchester School and in New College, Oxford,
   which he founded. The princely endowment of New College, the first
   stones of which were laid in 1387, embraced 100 scholarships. These
   gifts place Wykeham in the first rank of English patrons of learning at
   the side of Cardinal Wolsey. He also has a place in the manuals of the
   courtesies of life by his famous words, "Manners makyth man." [543]

   The struggles of previous centuries against the encroachment of Rome
   upon the temporalities of the English Church was maintained in this
   period. The complaint made by Matthew Paris [544] that the English
   Church was kept between two millstones, the king and the pope, remained
   true, with this difference, however, the king's influence came to
   preponderate. Acts of parliament emphasized his right to dictate or
   veto ecclesiastical appointments and recognized his sovereign
   prerogative to tax Church property. The evident support which the pope
   gave to France in her wars with England and the scandals of the Avignon
   residence were favorable to the crown's assertion of authority in these
   respects. Wyclif frequently complained that the pope and cardinals were
   "in league with the enemies of the English kingdom" [545] and the papal
   registers of the Avignon period, which record the appeals sent to the
   English king to conclude peace with France, almost always mention terms
   that would have made France the gainer. At the outbreak of the war,
   1339, Edward III. proudly complained that it broke his heart to see
   that the French troops were paid in part with papal funds. [546]

   The three most important religious acts of England between John's
   surrender of his crown to Innocent III. and the Act of Supremacy, 1534,
   were the parliamentary statutes of Mortmain, 1279, of Provisors, 1351,
   and for the burning of heretics, 1401. The statute of Mortmain or
   Dead-hand forbade the alienation of lands so as to remove them from the
   obligation of service or taxation to the secular power. The statute of
   Provisors, renewed and enlarged in the acts of Praemunire, 1353, 1390
   and 1393, concerned the subject of the papal rights over appointments
   and the temporalities of the English Church. This old bone of
   contention was taken up early in the 14th century in the statute of
   Carlyle, 1307, [547] which forbade aliens, appointed to visit religious
   houses in England, taking moneys with them out of the land and also the
   payment of tallages and impositions laid upon religious establishments
   from abroad. In 1343, parliament called upon the pope to recall all
   "reservations, provisions and collations" which, as it affirmed,
   checked Church improvements and the flow of alms. It further protested
   against the appointment of aliens to English livings, "some of them our
   enemies who know not our language." Clement VI., replying to the briefs
   of the king and parliament, declared that, when he made provisions and
   reservations, it was for the good of the Church, and exhorted Edward to
   act as a Catholic prince should and to permit nothing to be done in his
   realm inimical to the Roman Church and ecclesiastical liberty. Such
   liberty the pope said he would "defend as having to give account at the
   last judgment." Liberty in this case meant the free and unhampered
   exercise of the lordly claims made by his predecessors from Hildebrand
   down. [548] Thomas Fuller was close to the truth, when, defining papal
   provisions and reservations, he wrote, "When any bishopric, abbot's
   place, dignity or good living (aquila non capit muscas -- the eagle
   does not take note of flies) was like to be void, the pope, by a
   profitable prolepsis to himself, predisposed such places to such
   successors as he pleased. By this device he defeated, when he so
   pleased, the legal election of all convents and rightful presentation
   of all patrons."

   The memorable statute of Provisors forbade all papal provisions and
   reservations and all taxation of Church property contrary to the
   customs of England. The act of 1353 sought more effectually to clip the
   pope's power by forbidding the carrying of any suit against an English
   patron before a foreign tribunal. [549]

   To these laws the pope paid only so much heed as expediency required.
   This claim, made by one of his predecessors in the bull Cupientes, to
   the right to fill all the benefices of Christendom, he had no idea of
   abandoning, and, whenever it was possible, he provided for his hungry
   family of cardinals and other ecclesiastics out of the proverbially fat
   appointments of England. Indeed, the cases of such appointments given
   by Merimuth, and especially in the papal books as printed by Bliss, are
   so recurrent that one might easily get the impression that the
   pontiff's only concern for the English Church was to see that its
   livings were put into the hands of foreigners. I have counted the
   numbers in several places as given by Bliss. On one page, 4 out of 9
   entries were papal appointments. A section of 2½ pages announces
   "provisions of a canonry, with expectation of a prebend" in the
   following churches: 7 in Lincoln, 5 in Salisbury, 2 in Chichester, and
   1 each in Wells, York, Exeter, St. Patrick's, Dublin, Moray, Southwell,
   Howden, Ross, Aberdeen, Wilton. [550] From 1342-1385 the deanery of
   York was held successively by three Roman cardinals. In 1374, the
   incomes of the treasurer, dean and two archdeaneries of Salisbury went
   the same way. At the close of Edward III.'s reign, foreign cardinals
   held the deaneries of York, Salisbury and Lichfield, the archdeanery of
   Canterbury, reputed to be the richest of English preferments, and
   innumerable prebends. Bishops and abbots-elect had to travel to Avignon
   and often spend months and much money in securing confirmation to their
   appointments, and, in cases, the prelate-elect was set aside on the
   ground that provision had already been made for his office. As for sees
   reserved by the pope, Stubbs gives the following list, extending over a
   brief term of years: Worcester, Hereford, Durham and Rochester, 1317;
   Lincoln and Winchester, 1320; Lichfield, 1322; Winchester, 1328;
   Carlisle and Norwich, 1825; Worcester, Exeter and Hereford, 1827; Bath,
   1829; Durham, Canterbury, Winchester and Worcester, 1334. Provisions
   were made in full recognition of the plural system. Thus, Walter of
   London, the king's confessor, was appointed by the pope to the deanery
   of Wells, though, as stated in the papal brief, he already held a
   considerable list of "canonries and prebends," Lincoln, Salisbury, St.
   Paul, St. Martin Le Grand, London, Bridgenorth, Hastings and Hareswell
   in the diocese of Salisbury. [551] By the practice of promoting bishops
   from one see to another, the pope accomplished for his favorites what
   he could not have done in any other way. Thus, by the promotion of
   Sudbury in 1874 to Canterbury, the pope was able to translate Courtenay
   from Hereford to London, and Gilbert from Bangor to Hereford, and thus
   by a single stroke he was enriched by the first-fruits of four sees.

   In spite of legislation, the papal collectors continued to ply their
   trade in England, but less publicly and confidently than in the two
   preceding centuries. In 1379, Urban VI. sent Cosmatus Gentilis as his
   nuncio and collector-in-chief, with instructions that he and his
   subcollectors make speedy returns to Rome, especially of Peter's pence.
   [552] In 1375, Gregory XI. had called upon the archbishops of
   Canterbury and York to collect a tax of 60,000 florins for the defence
   of the lands of the Apostolic see, the English benefices, however, held
   by cardinals being exempted. The chronicler Merimuth, in a noteworthy
   paragraph summing up the curial practice of foraging upon the English
   sees and churches, emphasizes the persistence and shrewdness with which
   the Apostolic chair from the time of Clement V. had extorted gold and
   riches as though the English might be treated as barbarians. John XXII.
   he represents as having reserved all the good livings of England. Under
   Benedict XII., things were not so bad. Benedict's successor, Clement
   VI., was of all the offenders the most unscrupulous, reserving for
   himself or distributing to members of the curia the fattest places in
   England. England's very enemies, as Merimuth continues, were thus put
   into possession of English revenues, and the proverb became current at
   Avignon that the English were like docile asses bearing all the burdens
   heaped upon them. [553] This prodigal Frenchman threatened Edward III.
   with excommunication and the land with interdict, if resistance to his
   appointments did not cease and if their revenues continued to be
   withheld. The pope died in 1353, before the date set for the execution
   of his wrathful threat. While France was being made English by English
   arms, the Italian and French ecclesiastics were making conquest of
   England's resources.

   The great name of Wyclif, which appears distinctly in 1366, represents
   the patriotic element in all its strength. In his discussions of
   lordship, presented in two extensive treatises, he set forth the theory
   of the headship of the sovereign over the temporal affairs of the
   Church in his own dominions, even to the seizure of its temporalities.
   In him, the Church witnessed an ecclesiastic of equal metal with Thomas
   à Becket, a man, however, who did not stoop, in his love for his order,
   to humiliate the state under the hand of the Church. He represented the
   popular will, the common sense of mankind in regard to the province of
   the Church, the New Testament theory of the spiritual sphere. Had he
   not been practically alone, he would have anticipated by more than two
   centuries the limitation of the pope's power in England.

   § 40. John Wyclif.


   "A good man was there of religioun

   That was a pore Persone of a town;

   But rich he was of holy thought and werk;

   He was also a lerned man, a clerk,

   That Christes gospel trewly wolde preche.

   * * * * * * *

   This noble ensample to his shepe he gaf,

   That first he wrought and after that he taught.

   * * * * * * *

   A better priest I trow that nowhere non is,

   He waited after no pompe ne reverence;

   Ne maked him no spiced conscience,

   But Christes lore and his apostles twelve

   He taught, but first he folwed it himselve." [554]

   Chaucer.

   The title, Reformers before the Reformation, has been aptly given to a
   group of men of the 14th and 15th centuries who anticipated many of the
   teachings of Luther and the Protestant Reformers. They stand, each by
   himself, in solitary prominence, Wyclif in England, John Huss in
   Bohemia, Savonarola in Florence, and Wessel, Goch and Wesel in Northern
   Germany. To these men the sculptor has given a place on the pedestal of
   his famous group at Worms representing the Reformation of the 16th
   century. They differ, if we except the moral reformer, Savonarola, from
   the group of the German mystics, who sought a purification of life in
   quiet ways, in having expressed open dissent from the Church's ritual
   and doctrinal teachings. They also differ from the group of
   ecclesiastical reformers, D'Ailly, Gerson, Nicolas of Clamanges, who
   concerned themselves with the fabric of the canon law and did not go
   beyond the correction of abuses in the administration and morals of the
   Church. Wyclif and his successors were doctrinal reformers. In some
   views they had been anticipated by Marsiglius of Padua and the other
   assailants of the papacy of the early half of the 14th century.

   John Wyclif, called the Morning Star of the Reformation, and, at the
   time of his death, in England and in Bohemia the Evangelical doctor,
   [555] was born about 1324 near the village of Wyclif, Yorkshire, in the
   diocese of Durham. [556] His own writings give scarcely a clew to the
   events of his career, and little can be gathered from his immediate
   contemporaries. He was of Saxon blood. His studies were pursued at
   Oxford, which had six colleges. He was a student at Balliol and master
   of that hall in 1361. He was also connected with Merton and Queen's,
   and was probably master of Canterbury Hall, founded by Archbishop
   Islip. [557] He was appointed in succession to the livings of
   Fillingham, 1363, Ludgershall, 1368, and by the king's appointment, to
   Lutterworth, 1374. The living of Lutterworth was valued at £26 a year.

   Wyclif occupies a distinguished place as an Oxford schoolman, a
   patriot, a champion of theological and practical reforms and the
   translator of the Scriptures into English. The papal schism, occurring
   in the midst of his public career, had an important bearing on his
   views of papal authority.

   So far as is known, he confined himself, until 1366, to his duties in
   Oxford and his parish work. In that year he appears as one of the
   king's chaplains and as opposed to the papal supremacy in the
   ecclesiastial affairs of the realm. The parliament of the same year
   refused Urban V.'s demand for the payment of the tribute, promised by
   King John, which was back 33 years. John, it declared, had no right to
   obligate the kingdom to a foreign ruler without the nation's consent.
   Wyclif, if not a member of this body, was certainly an adviser to it.
   [558]

   In the summer of 1374, Wyclif went to Bruges as a member of the
   commission appointed by the king to negotiate peace with France and to
   treat with the pope's agents on the filling of ecclesiastical
   appointments in England. His name was second in the list of
   commissioners following the name of the bishop of Bangor. At Bruges we
   find him for the first time in close association with John of Gaunt,
   Edward's favorite son, an association which continued for several
   years, and for a time inured to his protection from ecclesiastical
   violence. [559]

   On his return to England, he began to speak as a religious reformer. He
   preached in Oxford and London against the pope's secular sovereignty,
   running about, as the old chronicler has it, from place to place, and
   barking against the Church. [560] It was soon after this that, in one
   of his tracts, he styled the bishop of Rome "the anti-Christ, the
   proud, worldly priest of Rome, and the most cursed of clippers and
   cut-purses." He maintained that-he "has no more power in binding and
   loosing than any priest, and that the temporal lords may seize the
   possessions of the clergy if pressed by necessity." The duke of
   Lancaster, the clergy's open foe, headed a movement to confiscate
   ecclesiastical property. Piers Ploughman had an extensive public
   opinion behind him when he exclaimed, "Take her lands, ye Lords, and
   let her live by dimes (tithes)." The Good Parliament of 1376, to whose
   deliberation Wyclif contributed by voice and pen, gave emphatic
   expression to the public complaints against the hierarchy.

   The Oxford professor's attitude had become too flagrant to be suffered
   to go unrebuked. In 1377, he was summoned before the tribunal of
   William Courtenay, bishop of London, at St. Paul's, where the
   proceedings opened with a violent altercation between the bishop and
   the duke. The question was as to whether Wyclif should take a seat or
   continue standing in the court. Percy, lord marshal of England, ordered
   him to sit down, a proposal the bishop pronounced an unheard-of
   indignity to the court. At this, Lancaster, who was present, swore he
   would bring down Courtenay's pride and the pride of all the prelates in
   England. "Do your best, Sir," was the spirited retort of the bishop,
   who was a son of the duke of Devonshire. A popular tumult ensued,
   Wyclif being protected by Lancaster.

   Pope Gregory XI. himself now took notice of the offender in a document
   condemning 19 sentences from his writings as erroneous and dangerous to
   Church and state. In fact, he issued a batch of at least five bulls,
   addressed to the archbishop of Canterbury, the bishop of London, the
   University of Oxford and the king, Edward III. The communication to
   Archbishop Sudbury opened with an unctuous panegyric of England's past
   most glorious piety and the renown of its Church leaders, champions of
   the orthodox faith and instructors not only of their own but of other
   peoples in the path of the Lord's commandments. But it had come to his
   ears that the Lutterworth rector had broken forth into such detestable
   madness as not to shrink from publicly proclaiming false propositions
   which threatened the stability of the entire Church. His Holiness,
   therefore, called upon the archbishop to have John sent to prison and
   kept in bonds till final sentence should be passed by the papal court.
   [561] It seems that the vice-chancellor of Oxford at least made a show
   of complying with the pope's command and remanded the heretical doctor
   to Black Hall, but the imprisonment was only nominal.

   Fortunately, the pope might send forth his fulminations to bind and
   imprison but it was not wholly in his power to hold the truth in bonds
   and to check the progress of thought. In his letter to the chancellor
   of Oxford, Gregory alleged that Wyclif was vomiting out of the filthy
   dungeon of his heart most wicked and damnable heresies, whereby he
   hoped to pollute the faithful and bring them to the precipice of
   perdition, overthrow the Church and subvert the secular estate. The
   disturber was put into the same category with those princes among
   errorists, Marsiglius of Padua and John of Jandun. [562]

   The archbishop's court at Lambeth, before which the offender was now
   cited, was met by a message from the widow of the Black Prince to stay
   the proceedings, and the sitting was effectually broken up by London
   citizens who burst into the hall. At Oxford, the masters of theology
   pronounced the nineteen condemned propositions true, though they
   sounded badly to the ear. A few weeks later, March, 1878, Gregory died,
   and the papal schism broke out. No further notice was taken of
   Gregory's ferocious bulls. Among other things, the nineteen
   propositions affirmed that Christ's followers have no right to exact
   temporal goods by ecclesiastical censures, that the excommunications of
   pope and priest are of no avail if not according to the law of Christ,
   that for adequate reasons the king may strip the Church of
   temporalities and that even a pope may be lawfully impeached by laymen.

   With the year 1378 Wyclif's distinctive career as a doctrinal reformer
   opens. He had defended English rights against foreign encroachment. He
   now assailed, at a number of points, the theological structure the
   Schoolmen and mediaeval popes had laboriously reared, and the abuses
   that had crept into the Church. The spectacle of Christendom divided by
   two papal courts, each fulminating anathemas against the other, was
   enough to shake confidence in the divine origin of the papacy. In
   sermons, tracts and larger writings, Wyclif brought Scripture and
   common sense to bear. His pen was as keen as a Damascus blade. Irony
   and invective, of which he was the master, he did not hesitate to use.
   The directness and pertinency of his appeals brought them easily within
   the comprehension of the popular mind. He wrote not only in Latin but
   in English. His conviction was as deep and his passion as fiery as
   Luther's, but on the one hand, Wyclif's style betrays less of the vivid
   illustrative power of the great German and little of his sympathetic
   warmth, while on the other, less of his unfortunate coarseness. As
   Luther is the most vigorous tract writer that Germany has produced, so
   Wyclif is the foremost religious pamphleteer that has arisen in
   England; and the impression made by his clear and stinging thrusts may
   be contrasted in contents and audience with the scholarly and finished
   tracts of the Oxford movement led by Pusey, Keble and Newman, the one
   reaching the conscience, the other appealing to the aesthetic tastes;
   the one adapted to break down priestly pretension, the other to foster
   it.

   But the Reformer of the 14th century was more than a scholar and
   publicist. Like John Wesley, he had a practical bent of mind, and like
   him he attempted to provide England with a new proclamation of the pure
   Gospel. To counteract the influence of the friars, whom he had begun to
   attack after his return from Bruges, he conceived the idea of
   developing and sending forth a body of itinerant evangelists. These
   "pore priests," as they were called, were taken from the list of Oxford
   graduates, and seem also to have included laymen. Of their number and
   the rules governing them, we are in the dark. The movement was begun
   about 1380, and on the one side it associates Wyclif with Gerrit de
   Groote, and on the other with Wesley and with his more recent
   fellow-countryman, General Booth, of the Salvation Army.

   Although this evangelistic idea took not the form of a permanent
   organization, the appearance of the pore preachers made a sensation.
   According to the old chronicler, the disciples who gathered around him
   in Oxford were many and, clad in long russet gowns of one pattern, they
   went on foot, ventilating their master's errors among the people and
   publicly setting them forth in sermons. [563] They had the distinction
   of being arraigned by no less a personage than Bishop Courtenay "as
   itinerant, unauthorized preachers who teach erroneous, yea, heretical
   assertions publicly, not only in churches but also in public squares
   and other profane places, and who do this under the guise of great
   holiness, but without having obtained any episcopal or papal
   authorization."

   It was in 1381, the year before Courtenay said his memorable words,
   that Walden reports that Wyclif "began to determine matters upon the
   sacrament of the altar." [564] To attempt an innovation at this crucial
   point required courage of the highest order. In 12 theses he declared
   the Church's doctrine unscriptural and misleading. For the first time
   since the promulgation of the dogma of transubstantiation by the Fourth
   Lateran was it seriously called in question by a theological expert. It
   was a case of Athanasius standing alone. The mendicants waxed violent.
   Oxford authorities, at the instance of the archbishop and bishops,
   instituted a trial, the court consisting of Chancellor Berton and 12
   doctors. Without mentioning Wyclif by name, the judges condemned as
   pestiferous the assertions that the bread and wine remain after
   consecration, and that Christ's body is present only figuratively or
   tropically in the eucharist. Declaring that the judges had not been
   able to break down his arguments, Wyclif went on preaching and
   lecturing at the university. But in the king's council, to which he
   made appeal, the duke of Lancaster took sides against him and forbade
   him to speak any more on the subject at Oxford. This prohibition Wyclif
   met with a still more positive avowal of his views in his Confession,
   which closes with the noble words, "I believe that in the end the truth
   will conquer."

   The same year, the Peasants' Revolt broke out, but there is no evidence
   that Wyclif had any more sympathy with the movement than Luther had
   with the Peasants' Rising of 1525. After the revolt was over, he
   proposed that Church property be given to the upper classes, not to the
   poor. [565] The principles, however, which he enunciated were germs
   which might easily spring up into open rebellion against oppression.
   Had he not written, "There is no moral obligation to pay tax or tithe
   to bad rulers either in Church or state. It is permitted to punish or
   depose them and to reclaim the wealth which the clergy have diverted
   from the poor?" One hundred and fifty years after this time, Tyndale
   said, "They said it in Wyclif's day, and the hypocrites say now, that
   God's Word arouseth insurrection." [566]

   Courtenay's elevation to the see of Canterbury boded no good to the
   Reformer. In 1382, he convoked the synod which is known in English
   history as the Earthquake synod, from the shock felt during its
   meetings. The primate was supported by 9 bishops, and when the earth
   began to tremble, he showed admirable courage by interpreting it as a
   favorable omen. The earth, in trying to rid itself of its winds and
   humors, was manifesting its sympathy with the body ecclesiastic. [567]
   Wyclif, who was not present, made another use of the occurrence, and
   declared that the Lord sent the earthquake "because the friars had put
   heresy upon Christ in the matter of the sacrament, and the earth
   trembled as it did when Christ was damned to bodily death." [568]

   The council condemned 24 articles, ascribed to the Reformer, 10 of
   which were pronounced heretical, and the remainder to be against the
   decisions of the Church. [569] The 4 main subjects condemned as heresy
   were that Christ is not corporally present in the sacrament, that oral
   confession is not necessary for a soul prepared to die, that after
   Urban VI.'s death the English Church should acknowledge no pope but,
   like the Greeks, govern itself, and that it is contrary to Scripture
   for ecclesiastics to hold temporal possessions. Courtenay followed up
   the synod's decisions by summoning Rygge, then chancellor of Oxford, to
   suppress the heretical teachings and teachers. Ignoring the summons,
   Rygge appointed Repyngdon, another of Wyclif's supporters, to preach,
   and when Peter Stokys, "a professor of the sacred page," armed with a
   letter from the archbishop, attempted to silence him, the students and
   tutors at Oxford threatened the Carmelite with their drawn swords.

   But Courtenay would permit no trifling and, summoning Rygge and the
   proctors to Lambeth, made them promise on their knees to take the
   action indicated. Parliament supported the primate. The new preaching
   was suppressed, but Wyclif stood undaunted. He sent a Complaint of 4
   articles to the king and parliament, in which he pleaded for the
   supremacy of English law in matters of ecclesiastical property, for the
   liberty for the friars to abandon the rules of their orders and follow
   the rule of Christ, and for the view that on the Lord's table the real
   bread and wine are present, and not merely the accidents. [570]

   The court was no longer ready to support the Reformer, and Richard II.
   sent peremptory orders to Rygge to suppress the new teachings.
   Courtenay himself went to Oxford, and there is some authority for the
   view that Wyclif again met the prelate face to face at St. Frideswides.
   Rigid inquisition was made for copies of the condemned teacher's
   writings and those of Hereford. Wyclif was inhibited from preaching,
   and retired to his rectory at Lutterworth. Hereford, Repyngdon, Aston
   and Bedeman, his supporters, recanted. The whole party received a
   staggering blow and with it liberty of teaching at Oxford. [571]

   Confined to Lutterworth, Wyclif continued his labors on the translation
   of the Bible, and sent forth polemic tracts, including the Cruciata,
   [572] a vigorous condemnation of the crusade which the bishop of
   Norwich, Henry de Spenser, was preparing in support of Urban VI.
   against the Avignon pope, Clement VII. The warlike prelate had already
   shown his military gifts during the Peasants' Uprising. Urban had
   promised plenary indulgence for a year to all joining the army. Mass
   was said and sermons preached in the churches of England, and large
   sums collected for the enterprise. The indulgence extended to the dead
   as well as to the living. Wyclif declared the crusade an expedition for
   worldly mastery, and pronounced the indulgence "an abomination of
   desolation in the holy place." Spenser's army reached the Continent,
   but the expedition was a failure. The most important of Wyclif's
   theological treatises, the Trialogus, was written in this period. It
   lays down the principle that, where the Bible and the Church do not
   agree, we must obey the Bible, and, where conscience and human
   authority are in conflict, we must follow conscience. [573]

   Two years before his death, Wyclif received a paralytic stroke which
   maimed but did not completely disable him. It is possible that he
   received a citation to appear before the pope. With unabated rigor of
   conviction, he replied to the supreme pontiff that of all men he was
   most under obligation to obey the law of Christ, that Christ was of all
   men the most poor, and subject to mundane authority. No Christian man
   has a right to follow Peter, Paul or any of the saints except as they
   imitated Christ. The pope should renounce all worldly authority and
   compel his clergy to do the same. He then asserted that, if in these
   views he was found to err, he was willing to be corrected, even by
   death. If it were in his power to do anything to advance these views by
   his presence in Rome, he would willingly go thither. But God had put an
   obstacle in his way, and had taught him to obey Him rather than man. He
   closed with the prayer that God might incline Urban to imitate Christ
   in his life and teach his clergy to do the same.

   While saying mass in his church, he was struck again with paralysis,
   and passed away two or three days after, Dec. 29, 1384, "having lit a
   fire which shall never be put out." [574] Fuller, writing of his death,
   exclaims, "Admirable that a hare, so often hunted with so many packs of
   dogs, should die quietly sitting in his form."

   Wyclif was spare, and probably never of robust health, but he was not
   an ascetic. He was fond of a good meal. In temper he was quick, in mind
   clear, in moral character unblemished. Towards his enemies he was
   sharp, but never coarse or ribald. William Thorpe, a young contemporary
   standing in the court of Archbishop Arundel, bore testimony that "he
   was emaciated in body and well-nigh destitute of strength, and in
   conduct most innocent. Very many of the chief men of England conferred
   with him, loved him dearly, wrote down his sayings and followed his
   manner of life." [575]

   The prevailing sentiment of the hierarchy was given by Walsingham,
   chronicler of St. Albans, who characterized the Reformer in these
   words: "On the feast of the passion of St. Thomas of Canterbury, John
   de Wyclif, that instrument of the devil, that enemy of the Church, that
   author of confusion to the common people, that image of hypocrites,
   that idol of heretics, that author of schism, that sower of hatred,
   that coiner of lies, being struck with the horrible judgment of God,
   was smitten with palsy and continued to live till St. Sylvester's Day,
   on which he breathed out his malicious spirit into the abodes of
   darkness."

   The dead was not left in peace. By the decree of Arundel, Wyclif's
   writings were suppressed, and it was so effective that Caxton and the
   first English printers issued no one of them from the press. The
   Lateran decree of February, 1413, ordered his books burnt, and the
   Council of Constance, from whose members, such as Gerson and D'Ailly,
   we might have expected tolerant treatment, formally condemned his
   memory and ordered his bones exhumed from their resting-place and "cast
   at a distance from the sepulchre of the church." The holy synod, so ran
   the decree, "declares said John Wyclif to have been a notorious
   heretic, and excommunicates him and condemns his memory as one who died
   an obstinate heretic." [576] In 1429, at the summons of Martin IV., the
   decree was carried out by Flemmyng, bishop of Lincoln.

   The words of Fuller, describing the execution of the decree of
   Constance, have engraven themselves on the page of English history.
   "They burnt his bones to ashes and cast them into Swift, a neighboring
   brook running hardby. Thus this brook hath conveyed his ashes into
   Avon, Avon into Severn, Severn into the narrow seas, they into the main
   ocean. And thus the ashes of Wicliffe are the emblem of his doctrine,
   which now is dispersed the world over."

   In the popular judgment of the English people, John Wyclif, in company
   with John Latimer and John Wesley, probably represents more fully than
   any other English religious leader, independence of thought, devotion
   to conscience, solid religious common sense, and the sound exposition
   of the Gospel. In the history of the intellectual and moral progress of
   his people, he was the leading Englishman of the Middle Ages. [577]

   [555] Fasciculi, p. 362.

   [556] Leland's Itinerary placed Wyclif's birth in 1324. Buddensieg and
   Rashdall prefer 1330. Leland, our first authority for the place of
   birth, mentions Spresswell (Hipswell) and Wyclif-on-Tees, places a half
   a mile apart. Wyclif's name is spelled in more than twenty different
   ways, as Wiclif, accepted by Lechler, Loserth, Buddensieg and German
   scholars generally; Wiclef, Wicliffe, Wicleff, Wycleff. Wycliffe,
   adopted by Foxe, Milman, Poole, Stubbs, Rashdall, Bigg; Wyclif
   preferred by Shirley, Matthew, Sergeant, the Wyclif Society, the Early
   English Text Society, etc. The form Wyclif is found in a diocesan
   register of 1361, when the Reformer was warden of Balliol College. The
   earliest mention in an official state document, July 26, 1374, gives it
   Wiclif. On Wyclif's birthplace, see Shirley, Fasciculi, p. x sqq.

   [557] A Wyclif is mentioned in connection with all of these colleges.
   The question is whether there were not two John Wyclifs. A John de
   Whyteclyve was rector of Mayfield, 1361, and later of Horsted Kaynes,
   where he died, 1383. In 1365 Islip, writing from Mayfield, appointed a
   John Wyclyve warden of Canterbury Hall. Shirley, Note on the two
   Wiclifs, in the Fasciculi, p. 513 sqq., advocated the view that this
   Wyclif was a different person from our John Wyclif, and he is followed
   by Poole, Rashdall and Sergeant. Principal Wilkinson of Marlborough
   College, Ch. Quart. Rev., October, 1877, makes a strong statement
   against this view; Lechler and Buddensieg, the two leading German
   authorities on Wyclif's career, also admit only a single Wyclif as
   connected with the Oxford Halls.

   [558] So Lechler, who advances strong arguments in favor of this view.
   Loserth, who is followed by Rashdall, brings considerations against it,
   and places Wyclif's first appearance as a political reformer in 1376.
   Studien zur Kirchenpol., etc., pp. 1, 32, 35, 44, 60. A serious
   difficulty with this view is that it crowds almost all the Reformer's
   writings into 7 years.

   The reply is hardly what we might have expected from Wyclif, confining
   itself, as it does, rather curtly to the question of the pope's
   authority and manner of life. Luther's last treatment of the pope, Der
   Papst der Ende-Christ und Wider Christ, is not a full parallel. Wyclif
   was independent, not coarse.

   [574] 2 The most credible narrative preserved of Wyclif's death comes
   from John Horn, the Reformer's assistant for two years, and was written
   down by Dr. Thomas Gascoigne upon Horn's sworn statement. Walden twice
   makes the charge that disappointment at not being appointed bishop of
   Worcester started Wyclif on the path of heresy, but there is no other
   authority for the story, which is inherently improbable. Lies were also
   invented against the memories of Luther, Calvin and Knox, which the
   respectable Catholic historians set aside.

   [575] Bale, in his account of the Examination of Thorpe, Parker Soc.

   give portraits of Wyclif. The oldest, according to Sergeant, pp. 16-21,
   is taken from Bale's Summary, 1548. There is a resemblance in all the
   portraits, which represent the Reformer clothed in Oxford gown and cap,
   with long beard, open face, clear, large eye, prominent nose and cheek
   bones and pale complexion.

   [577] 2 Green, in his Hist. of the Engl. People, passes a notable
   encomium on the "first Reformer," and the late Prof. Bigg, Wayside
   Sketches, p.131, asserts "that his beliefs are in the main those of the
   great majority of Englishmen to-day, and this is a high proof of the
   justice, the clearness and the sincerity of his thoughts." The Catholic
   historian of England, Lingard, IV. 192, after speaking of Wyclif's
   intellectual perversion, refers to him, "as that extraordinary man who,
   exemplary in his morals, declaimed against vice with the freedom and
   severity of an Apostle."
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 41. Wyclif's Teachings.

   Wyclif's teachings lie plainly upon the surface of his many writings.
   In each one of the eminent rôles he played, as schoolman, political
   reformer, preacher, innovator in theology and translator of the Bible,
   he wrote extensively. His views show progress in the direction of
   opposition to the mediaeval errors and abuses. Driven by attacks, he
   detected errors which, at the outset, he did not clearly discern. But,
   above all, his, study of the Scriptures forced upon him a system which
   was in contradiction to the distinctively mediaeval system of theology.
   His language in controversy was so vigorous that it requires an unusual
   effort to suppress the impulse to quote at great length.

   Clear as Wyclif's statements always are, some of his works are drawn
   out by much repetition. Nor does he always move in a straight line, but
   digresses to this side and to that, taking occasion to discuss at
   length subjects cognate to the main matter he has in hand. This habit
   often makes the reading of his larger works a wearisome task.
   Nevertheless, the author always brings the reader back from his
   digression or, to use a modern expression, never leaves him
   sidetracked.

   I. As a Schoolman.--Wyclif was beyond dispute the most eminent scholar
   who taught for any length of time at Oxford since Grosseteste, whom he
   often quotes. [578] He was read in Chrysostom, Augustine, Jerome and
   other Latin Fathers, as well as in the mediaeval theologians from
   Anselm to Duns Scotus, Bradwardine, Fitzralph and Henry of Ghent. His
   quotations are many, but with increasing emphasis, as the years went
   on, he made his final appeal to the Scriptures. He was a moderate
   realist and ascribed to nominalism all theological error. He seems to
   have endeavored to shun the determinism of Bradwardine, and declared
   that the doctrine of necessity does not do away with the freedom of the
   will, which is so free that it cannot be compelled. Necessity compels
   the creature to will, that is, to exercise his freedom, but at that
   point he is left free to choose. [579]

   II. As a Patriot.--In this role the Oxford teacher took an attitude the
   very reverse of the attitude assumed by Anselm and Thomas à Becket, who
   made the English Church a servant to the pope's will in all things. For
   loyalty to the Hildebrandian theocracy, Anselm was willing to suffer
   banishment and à Becket suffered death. In Wyclif, the mutterings of
   the nation, which had been heard against the foreign regime from the
   days of William the Conqueror, and especially since King John's reign,
   found a stanch and uncompromising mouthpiece. Against the whole system
   of foreign jurisdiction he raised his voice, as also against the
   Church's claim to hold lands, except as it acknowledged the rights of
   the state. He also opposed the tenure of secular offices by the clergy
   and, when Archbisbop Sudbury was murdered, declared that he died in sin
   because he was holding the office of chancellor.

   Wyclif's views on government in Church and state are chiefly set forth
   in the works on Civil and Divine Lordship--De dominio divino, and De
   dominio civili -- and in his Dialogus. [580] The Divine Lordship
   discusses the title by which men hold property and exercise government,
   and sets forth the distinction between sovereignty and stewardship.
   Lordship is not properly proprietary. It is stewardship. Christ did not
   desire to rule as a tenant with absolute rights, but in the way of
   communicating to others. [581] As to his manhood, he was the most
   perfect of servants.

   The Civil Lordship opens by declaring that no one in mortal sin has a
   right to lordship, and that every one in the state of grace has a real
   lordship over the whole universe. All Christians are reciprocally lords
   and servants. The pope, or an ecclesiastical body abusing the property
   committed to them, may be deprived of it by the state. Proprietary
   right is limited by proper use. Tithes are an expedient to enable the
   priesthood to perform its mission. The New Testament does not make them
   a rule.

   From the last portion of the first book of the Civil Lordship, Gregory
   XI. drew most of the articles for which Wyclif had to stand trial. Here
   is found the basis for the charge ascribing to him the famous statement
   that God ought to obey the devil. By this was meant nothing more than
   that the jurisdiction of every lawful proprietor should be recognized.

   III. As a Preacher.--Whether we regard Wyclif's constant activity in
   the pulpit, or the impression his sermons made, he must be pronounced
   by far the most notable of English preachers prior to the Reformation.
   [582] 294 of his English sermons and 224 of his Latin sermons have been
   preserved. To these discourses must be added his English expositions of
   the Lord's prayer, the songs of the Bible, the seven deadly sins and
   other subjects. With rare exceptions, the sermons are based upon
   passages of the New Testament.

   The style of the English discourses is simple and direct. No more
   plainly did Luther preach against ecclesiastical abuses than did the
   English Reformer. On every page are joined with practical religious
   exposition stirring passages rebuking the pope and worldly prelates.
   They are denounced as anti-christ and the servants of the devil--the
   fiend--as they turn away from the true work of pasturing Christ's flock
   for worldly gain and enjoyment. The preacher condemns the false
   teachings which are nowhere taught in the Scriptures, such as
   pilgrimages and indulgences. Sometimes Wyclif seems to be inconsistent
   with himself, now making light of fasting, now asserting that the
   Apostles commended it; now disparaging prayers for the dead, now
   affirming purgatory. With special severity do his sermons strike at the
   friars who preach out of avarice and neglect to expose the sins of
   their hearers. No one is more idle than the rich friars, who have
   nothing but contempt for the poor. Again and again in these sermons, as
   in his other works, he urges that the goods of the friars be seized and
   given to the needy classes. Wyclif, the preacher, was always the bold
   champion of the layman's rights.

   His work, The Pastoral Office, which is devoted to the duties of the
   faithful minister, and his sermons lay stress upon preaching as the
   minister's proper duty. Preaching he declared the "highest service,"
   even as Christ occupied himself most in that work. And if bishops, on
   whom the obligation to preach more especially rests, preach not, but
   are content to have true priests preach in their stead, they are as
   those that murder Jesus. The same authority which gave to priests the
   privilege of celebrating the sacrament of the altar binds them to
   preach. Yea, the preaching of the Word is a more precious occupation
   than the ministration of the sacraments. [583]

   When the Gospel was preached, as in Apostolic times, the Church grew.
   Above all things, close attention should be given to Christ's words,
   whose authority is superior to all the rites and commandments of pope
   and friars. Again and again Wyclif sets forth the ideal minister, as in
   the following description:--

   "A priest should live holily, in prayer, in desires and thought, in
   godly conversation and honest teaching, having God's commandments and
   His Gospel ever on his lips. And let his deeds be so righteous that no
   man may be able with cause to find fault with them, and so open his
   acts that he may be a true book to all sinful and wicked men to serve
   God. For the example of a good life stirreth men more than true
   preaching with only the naked word."

   The priest's chief work is to render a substitute for Christ's miracles
   by converting himself and his neighbor to God's law. [584] The Sermon
   on the Mount, Wyclif pronounced sufficient for the guidance of human
   life apart from any of the requirements and traditions of men.

   IV. As a Doctrinal Reformer.--Wyclif's later writings teem with denials
   of the doctrinal tenets of his age and indictments against
   ecclesiastical abuses. There could be no doubt of his meaning.
   Beginning with the 19 errors Gregory XI. was able to discern, the list
   grew as the years went on. The Council of Constance gave 45, Netter of
   Walden, fourscore, and the Bohemian John Lücke, an Oxford doctor of
   divinity, 266. Cochlaeus, in writing against the Hussites, went beyond
   all former computations and ascribed to Wyclif the plump sum of 303
   heresies, surely enough to have forever covered the Reformer's memory
   with obloquy. Fuller suggests as the reason for these variations that
   some lists included only the Reformer's primitive tenets or breeders,
   and others reckoned all the younger fry of consequence derived from
   them.

   The first three articles adduced by the Council of Constance [585] had
   respect to the Lord's Supper, and charged Wyclif with holding that the
   substance of the bread remains unchanged after the consecration, that
   Christ is not in the sacrament of the altar in a real sense, and the
   accidents of a thing cannot remain after its substance is changed. The
   4th article accuses him with declaring that the acts of bishop or
   priest in baptizing, ordaining and consecrating are void if the
   celebrant be in a state of mortal sin. Then follow charges of other
   alleged heresies, such as that after Urban VI. the papacy should be
   abolished, the clergy should hold no temporal possessions, the friars
   should gain their living by manual toil and not by begging, Sylvester
   and Constantine erred in endowing the Church, the papal elections by
   the cardinals were an invention of the devil, it is not necessary to
   salvation that one believe the Roman church to be supreme amongst the
   churches and that all the religious orders were introduced by the
   devil.

   The most of the 45 propositions represent Wyclif's views with
   precision. They lie on the surface of his later writings, but they do
   not exhaust his dissent from the teachings and practice of his time.
   His assault may be summarized under five heads: the nature of the
   Church, the papacy, the priesthood, the doctrine of transubstantiation
   and the use of the Scriptures.

   The Church was defined in the Civil Lordship to be the body of the
   elect,--living, dead and not yet born,--whose head is Christ. Scarcely
   a writing has come down to us from Wyclif's pen in which he does not
   treat the subject, and in his special treatise on the Church, written
   probably in 1378, it is defined more briefly as the body of all the
   elect--congregatio omnium predestinatorum. Of this body, Christ alone
   is the head. The pope is the head of a local church. Stress is laid
   upon the divine decree as determining who are the predestinate and who
   the reprobate. [586]

   Some persons, he said, in speaking of "Holy Church, understand thereby
   prelates and priests, monks and canons and friars and all that have the
   tonsure,--alle men that han crownes,--though they live ever so
   accursedly in defiance of God's law." But so far from this being true,
   all popes cardinals and priests are not among the saved. On the
   contrary, not even a pope can tell assuredly that he is predestinate.
   This knows no one on earth. The pope may be a prescitus, a reprobate.
   Such popes there have been, and it is blasphemy for cardinals and
   pontiffs to think that their election to office of itself constitutes a
   title to the primacy of the Church. The curia is a nest of heretics if
   its members do not follow Christ, a fountain of poison, the abomination
   of desolation spoken of in the sacred page. Gregory XI. Wyclif called a
   terrible devil--horrendus diabolus. God in His mercy had put him to
   death and dispersed his confederates, whose crimes Urban VI. had
   revealed. [587]

   Though the English Reformer never used the terms visible and invisible
   Church, he made the distinction. The Church militant, he said,
   commenting on John 10:26, is a mixed body. The Apostles took two kinds
   of fishes, some of which remained in the net and some broke away. So in
   the Church some are ordained to bliss and some to pain, even though
   they live godly for a while. [588] It is significant that in his
   English writings Wyclif uses the term Christen men--Christian
   men--instead of the term the faithful.

   As for the papacy, no one has used more stinging words against
   individual popes as well as against the papacy as an institution than
   did Wyclif. In the treatises of his last years and in his sermons, the
   pope is stigmatized as anti-Christ. His very last work, on which he was
   engaged when death overtook him, bore the title, Anti-christ, meaning
   the pope. He went so far as to call him the head-vicar of the fiend.
   [589] He saw in the papacy the revelation of the man of sin. The office
   is wholly poisonous--totum papale officium venenosum. He heaped
   ridicule upon the address "most holie fadir." The pope is neither
   necessary to the Church nor is he infallible. If both popes and all
   their cardinals were cast into hell, believers could be saved as well
   without them. They were created not by Christ but by the devil. The
   pope has no exclusive right to declare what the Scriptures teach, or
   proclaim what is the supreme law. His absolutions are of no avail
   unless Christ has absolved before. Popes have no more right to
   excommunicate than devils have to curse. Many of them are damned--multi
   papae sunt dampnati. Strong as such assertions are, it is probable that
   Wyclif did not mean to cast aside the papacy altogether. But again and
   again the principle is stated that the Apostolic see is to be obeyed
   only so far as it follows Christ's law. [590]

   As for the interpretation of Matthew 16:18, Wyclif took the view that
   "the rock" stands for Peter and every true Christian. The keys of the
   kingdom of heaven are not metal keys, as popularly supposed, but
   spiritual power, and they were committed not only to Peter, but to all
   the saints, "for alle men that comen to hevene have these keies of
   God." [591] Towards the pope's pretension to political functions,
   Wyclif was, if possible, more unsparing. Christ paid tribute to Caesar.
   So should the pope. His deposition of kings is the tyranny of the
   devil. By disregarding Peter's injunction not to lord it over God's
   heritage, but to feed the flock, he and all his sect--tota secta --
   prove themselves hardened heretics.

   Constantine's donation, the Reformer pronounced the beginning of all
   evils in the Church. The emperor was put up to it by the devil. It was
   his new trick to have the Church endowed. [592] Chapter after chapter
   of the treatise on the Church calls upon the pope, prelates and priests
   to return to the exercise of spiritual functions. They had become the
   prelates and priests of Caesar. As the Church left Christ to follow
   Caesar, so now it should abandon Caesar for Christ. As for kissing the
   pope's toe, there it; no foundation for it in Scripture or reason.

   The pope's practice of getting money by tribute and taxation calls
   forth biting invective. It was the custom, Wyclif said, to solemnly
   curse in the parish churches all who clipped the king's coins and cut
   men's purses. From this it would seem, he continued, that the proud and
   worldly priest of Rome and all his advisers were the most cursed of
   clippers and out-purses,--cursed of clipperis and purse-kerveris,--for
   they drew out of England poor men's livelihoods and many thousands of
   marks of the king's money, and this they did for spiritual favors. If
   the realm had a huge hill of gold, it would soon all be spent by this
   proud and worldly priest-collector. Of all men, Christ was the most
   poor, both in spirit and in goods and put from him all manner of
   worldly lordship. The pope should leave his authority to worldly lords,
   and speedily advise his clergy to do the same. I take it, as a matter
   of faith, that no man should follow the pope, nor even any of the
   saints in heaven, except as they follow Christ. [593]

   The priests and friars formed another subject of Wyclif's vigorous
   attack. Clerics who follow Christ are true priests and none other. The
   efficacy of their acts of absolution of sins depends upon their own
   previous absolution by Christ. The priest's function is to show
   forgiveness, already pronounced by God, not to impart it. It was, he
   affirmed, a strange and marvellous thing that prelates and curates
   should "curse so faste," when Christ said we should bless rather than
   reprove. A sentence of excommunication is worse than murder.

   The rule of auricular confession Wyclif also disparaged. True
   contrition of heart is sufficient for the removal of sins. In Christ's
   time confession of man to man was not required. In his own day, he
   said, "shrift to God is put behind; but privy (private) shrift, a
   new-found thing, is authorized as needful for the soul's health." He
   set forth the dangers of the confessional, such as the unchastity of
   priests. He also spoke of the evils of pilgrimages when women and men
   going together promiscuously were in temptation of great "lecherie."
   [594] Clerical celibacy, a subject the Reformer seldom touched upon, he
   declared, when enforced, is against Scripture, and as under the old law
   priests were allowed to marry, so under the new the practice is never
   forbidden, but rather approved.

   Straight truth-telling never had a warmer champion than Wyclif.
   Addressing the clergy, he devotes nearly a hundred pages of his Truth
   of Scripture to an elaboration of this principle. Not even the most
   trifling sin is permissible as a means of averting a greater evil,
   either for oneself or one's neighbor. Under no circumstances does a
   good intention justify a falsehood. The pope himself has no right to
   tolerate or practice misrepresentation to advance a good cause. To
   accomplish a good end, the priest dare not even make a false appeal to
   fear. All lying is of itself sin, and no dispensation can change its
   character. [595]

   The friars called forth the Reformer's keenest thrusts, and these
   increased in sharpness as he neared the end of his life. Quotations,
   bearing on their vices, would fill a large volume. Entire treatises
   against their heresies and practices issued from his pen. They were
   slavish agents of the pope's will; they spread false views of the
   eucharist; they made merchandise of indulgences and letters of
   fraternity which pretended to give the purchasers a share in their own
   good deeds here and at the final accounting. Their lips were full of
   lies and their hands of blood. They entered houses and led women
   astray; they lived in idleness; they devoured England. [596]

   The Reformer had also a strong word to say on the delusion of the
   contemplative life as usually practised. It was the guile of Satan that
   led men to imagine their fancies and dreamings were religious
   contemplation and to make them an excuse for sloth. John the Baptist
   and Christ both left the desert to live among men. He also went so far
   as to demand that monks be granted the privilege of renouncing the
   monkish rule for some other condition where they might be useful. [597]

   The four mendicant orders, the Carmelites, Augustinians, Jacobites or
   Dominicans, and Minorites or Franciscans gave their first letters to
   the word Caim, showing their descent from the first murderer. Their
   convents, Wyclif called Cain's castles. His relentless indignation
   denounced them as the tail of the dragon, ravening wolves, the sons of
   Satan, the emissaries of anti-christ and Luciferians and pronounced
   them worse than Herod, Saul and Judas. The friars repeat that Christ
   begged water at the well. It were to their praise if they begged water
   and nothing else. [598]

   With the lighter hand of ridicule, Chaucer also held up the mendicants
   for indictment. In the Prologue to his Canterbury Tales he represents
   the friar as an--


   ... easy man to yeve penaunce,

   Ther as he wiste to have a good pitaunce

   For unto a powre order for to give

   Is signe that a man is well y-shrive.

   * * * * * * *

   His wallet lay biforn him in his lappe

   Bretful of pardoun come from Rome all hoot,

   A voys he hadde as smal as hath a goot

   Ne was ther swich another pardonour

   For in his male he hadde a pilwe-beer [pillow]

   Which that, he seyde, was our Lady's veyl:

   And in a glas he hadde a pigges bones.

   Skeat's ed., 4:7, 21.

   If it required boldness to attack the powerful body of the monks, it
   required equal boldness to attack the mediaeval dogma of
   transubstantiation. Wyclif himself called it a doctrine of the moderns
   and of the recent Church--novella ecclesia. In his treatise on the
   eucharist, he praised God that he had been delivered from its laughable
   and scandalous errors. [599] The dogma of the transmutation of the
   elements he pronounced idolatry, a lying fable. His own view is that of
   the spiritual presence. Christ's body, so far as its dimensions are
   concerned, is in heaven. It is efficaciously or virtually in the host
   as in a symbol. [600] This symbol "represents"--vicarius est--the body.

   Neither by way of impanation nor of identification, much less by way of
   transmutation, is the body in the host. Christ is in the bread as a
   king is in all parts of his dominions and as the soul is in the body.
   In the breaking of the bread, the body is no more broken than the
   sunbeam is broken when a piece of glass is shattered: Christ is there
   sacramentally, spiritually, efficiently--sacramentaliter, spiritualiter
   et virtualiter. Transubstantiation is the greatest of all heresies and
   subversive of logic, grammar and all natural science. [601]

   The famous controversy as to whether a mouse, partaking of the
   sacramental elements, really partakes of Christ's body is discussed in
   the first pages of the treatise on the eucharist. Wyclif pronounces the
   primary assumption false, for Christ is not there in a corporal manner.
   An animal, in eating a man, does not eat his soul. The opinion that the
   priest actually breaks Christ's body and so breaks his neck, arms and
   other members, is a shocking error. What could be more
   shocking,--horribilius,--he says, than that the priest should daily
   make and consecrate the Lord's body, and what more shocking than to be
   obliged to eat Christ's very flesh and drink his very blood. Yea, what
   could be thought of more shocking than that Christ's body may be burned
   or eructated, or that the priest carries God in bodily form on the tips
   of his fingers. The words of institution are to be taken in a
   figurative sense. In a similar manner, the Lord spoke of himself as the
   seed and of the world as the field, and called John, Elijah, not
   meaning that the two were one person. In saying, I am the vine, he
   meant that the vine is a symbol of himself.

   The impossibility of the miracle of elemental transmutation, Wyclif
   based on the philosophical principle that the substance of a thing
   cannot be separated from its accidents. If accidents can exist by
   themselves, then it is impossible to tell what a thing is or whether it
   exists at all. Transubstantiation would logically demand
   transaccidentation, an expression the English Reformer used before
   Luther. The theory that the accidents remain while the substance is
   changed, he pronounced "grounded neither in holy writt ne reson ne wit
   but only taughte by newe hypocritis and cursed heretikis that magnyfyen
   there own fantasies and dremes." [602]

   Another proof of Wyclif's freedom of mind was his assertion that the
   Roman Church, in celebrating the sacrament, has no right to make a
   precise form of words obligatory, as the words of institution differ in
   the different accounts of the New Testament. As for the profitable
   partaking of the elements, he declared that the physical eating profits
   nothing except the soul be fed with love. Announcing it as his
   expectation that he would be set upon for his views, he closed his
   notable treatise on the eucharist with the words, The truth of reason
   will prevail over all things.


   Super omnia vincit veritas rationis.

   In these denials of the erroneous system of the mediaeval Church at its
   vital points, Wyclif was far in advance of his own age and anticipated
   the views of the Protestant Reformers.

   § 42. Wyclif and the Scriptures.

   Wyclif's chief service for his people, next to the legacy of his own
   personality, was his assertion of the supreme authority of the Bible
   for clergy and laymen alike and his gift to them of the Bible in their
   own tongue. His statements, setting forth the Scriptures as the clear
   and sufficient manual of salvation and insisting that the literal sense
   gives their plain meaning, were as positive and unmistakable as any
   made by Luther. In his treatise on the value and authority of the
   Scriptures, with 1000 printed pages, [603] more is said about the Bible
   as the Church's appointed guide-book than was said by all the mediaeval
   theologians together. And none of the Schoolmen, from Anselm and
   Abaelard to Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus, exalted it to such a
   position of preëminence as did he. With one accord they limited its
   authority by coördinating with its contents tradition, that is, the
   teachings of the Church. This man, with unexcelled precision and
   cogency, affirmed its final jurisdiction, as the law of God, above all
   authorities, papal, decretist or patristic. What Wyclif asserts in this
   special treatise, he said over again in almost every one of his works,
   English and Latin. If possible, he grew more emphatic as his last years
   went on, and his Opus evangelicum, probably his very last writing,
   abounds in the most positive statements language is capable of.

   To give the briefest outline of the Truth of Scripture will be to state
   in advance the positions of the Protestant Reformers in regard to the
   Bible as the rule of faith and morals. To Wyclif the Scriptures are the
   authority for every Catholic tenet. They are the Law of Christ, the Law
   of God, the Word of God, the Book of Life--liber vitae. They are the
   immaculate law of the Lord, most true, most complete and most
   wholesome. [604] All things necessary to belief for salvation are found
   in them. They are the Catholic faith, the Christian faith,--fides
   christiana,--the primal rule of human perfection, the primal foundation
   of the Christian proclamation.

   This book is the whole truth which every Christian should study. [605]
   It is the measure and standard of all logic. Logic, as in Oxford,
   changes very frequently, yea, every twenty years, but the Scriptures
   are yea, yea and nay, nay. They never change. They stand to eternity.
   [606] All logic, all law, all philosophy and all ethic are in them. As
   for the philosophy of the pagan world, whatever it offers that is in
   accord with the Scriptures is true. The religious philosophy which the
   Christian learns from Aristotle he learns because it was taught by the
   authors of Scripture. [607] The Greek thinker made mistakes, as when he
   asserted that creation is eternal. In several places Wyclif confesses
   that he himself had at one time been led astray by logic and the desire
   to win fame, but was thankful to God that he had been converted to the
   full acceptance of the Scriptures as they are and to find in them all
   logic.

   All through this treatise, and in other works, Wyclif contends against
   those who pronounced the sacred writings irrational or blasphemous or
   abounding in errors and plain falsehoods. Such detractors he labelled
   modern or recent doctors--moderni novelli doctores. Charges such as
   these would seem well-nigh incredible, if Wyclif did not repeat them
   over and over again. They remind us of the words of the priest who told
   Tyndale, 150 years later, "It were better to be without God's laws than
   to be without the pope's." What could be more
   shocking,--horribilius,--exclaimed Wyclif, than to assert that God's
   words are false. [608]

   The supreme authority of the Scriptures appears from their contents,
   the beneficent aim they have in view, and from the witness borne to
   them by Christ. God speaks in all the books. They are one great Word of
   God. Every syllable of the two Testaments is true, and the authors were
   nothing more than scribes or heralds. [609] If any error seem to be
   found in them, the error is due to human ignorance and perverseness.
   Nothing is to be believed that is not founded upon this book, and to
   its teachings nothing is to be added. [610]

   Wyclif devotes much time to the principles of biblical exposition and
   brushes away the false principles of the Fath-ers and Schoolmen by
   pronouncing the "literal verbal sense" the true one. On occasion, in
   his sermons, he himself used the other senses, but his sound judgment
   led him again and again to lay emphasis upon the etymological meaning
   of words as final. The tropological, anagogical and allegorical
   meanings, if drawn at all, must be based upon the literal meaning.
   Wyclif confessed his former mistake of striving to distinguish them
   with strict precision. There is, in fact, only one sense of Scripture,
   the one God himself has placed in it as the book of life for the
   wayfaring man. [611] Heresy is the contradiction of Scripture. As for
   himself, Wyclif said, he was ready to follow its teachings, even unto
   martyrdom, if necessary. [612] For hundreds of years no eminent teacher
   had emphasized the right of the laity to the Word of God. It was
   regarded as a book for the clergy, and the interpretation of its
   meaning was assumed to rest largely with the decretists and the pope.
   The Council of Toulouse, 1229, had forbidden the use of the Bible to
   laymen. The condemned sects of the 12th and 13th centuries, especially
   the Waldenses, had adopted another rule, but their assailants, such as
   Alanus ab Insulis, had shown how dangerous their principle was. Wyclif
   stood forth as the champion of an open Bible. It was a book to be
   studied by all Christians, for "it is the whole truth." Because it was
   given to the Church, its teachings are free to every one, even as is
   Christ himself. [613]

   To withhold the Scriptures from the laity is a fundamental sin. To make
   them known in the mother-tongue is the first duty of the priest. For
   this reason priests ought always to be familiar with the language of
   the people. Wyclif held up the friars for declaring it heresy to
   translate God's law into English and make it known to laymen. He argued
   against their position by referring to the gift of tongues at Pentecost
   and to Jerome's translation, to the practice of Christ and the Apostles
   who taught peoples in their native languages and to the existence in
   his own day of a French translation made in spite of all hindrances.
   Why, he exclaims, "should not Englishmen do the same, for as the lords
   of England have the Bible in French, it would not be against reason if
   they had the same material in English." Through an English Bible
   Englishmen would be enabled best "to follow Christ and come to heaven."
   [614] What could be more positive than the following words?

   Christen men and women, olde and young, shulden study fast in the New
   Testament, and no simple man of wit shulde be aferde unmeasurably to
   study in the text of holy Writ. Pride and covetise of clerks is cause
   of their blyndness and heresie and priveth them fro verie understonding
   of holy Writ. The New Testament is of ful autorite and open to
   understonding of simple men, as to the pynts that ben most needful to
   salvation.

   Wyclif was the first to give the Bible to his people in their own
   tongue. He knew no Hebrew and probably no Greek. His version, which was
   made from the Latin Vulgate, was the outgrowth of his burning desire to
   make his English countrymen more religious and more Christian. The
   paraphrastic translation of books which proceeded from the pen of
   Richard Rolle and perhaps a verse of the New Testament of Kentish
   origin and apparently made for a nunnery, [615] must be considered as
   in no wise in conflict with the claim of priority made for the English
   Reformer. In his task he had the aid of Nicolas Hereford, who
   translated the Old Testament and the Apocryphal books as far as Baruch
   3:20. A revision was made of Wyclif's Bible soon after his death, by
   Purvey. In his prologue, Purvey makes express mention of the "English
   Bible late translated," and affirms that the Latin copies had more need
   of being corrected than it. One hundred and seventy copies of these two
   English bibles are extant, and it seems strange that, until the edition
   issued by Forshall and Madden in 1850, they remained unprinted. [616]
   The reason for their not being struck off on the presses of Caxton and
   other early English printers, who issued the Golden Legend, with its
   fantastic and often grewsome religious tales, was that Wyclif had been
   pronounced a heretic and his version of the Scriptures placed under the
   ban by the religious authorities in England.

   A manuscript preserved in the Bodleian, Forshall and Madden affirm to
   be without question the original copy of Hereford himself. These
   editors place the dates of the versions in 1382 and 1388. Purvey was a
   Lollard, who boarded under Wyclif's roof and, according to the
   contemporary chronicler, Knighton, drank plentifully of his
   instructions. He was imprisoned, but in 1400 recanted, and was promoted
   to the vicarage of Hythe. This preferment he resigned three years
   later. He was imprisoned a second time by Archbishop Chichele, 1421,
   was alive in 1427, and perhaps died in prison.

   To follow the description given by Knighton in his Chronicle, the gift
   of the English Bible was regarded by Wyclif's contemporaries as both a
   novel act and an act of desecration. The irreverence and profanation of
   offering such a translation was likened to the casting of pearls before
   swine. The passage in Knighton, who wrote 20 years after Wyclif's
   death, runs thus: --

   The Gospel, which Christ bequeathed to the clergy and doctors of the
   Church,--as they in turn give it to lay and weaker persons,--this
   Master John Wyclif translated out of the Latin into the Anglican
   tongue, not the Angelic tongue, so that by him it is become
   common,--vulgare,--and more open to the lay folk and to women, knowing
   how to read, than it used to be to clerics of a fair amount of learning
   and of good minds. Thus, the Gospel pearl is cast forth and trodden
   under foot of swine, and what was dear to both clergy and laity is now
   made a subject of common jest to both, and the jewel of the clergy is
   turned into the sport of the laity, so that what was before to the
   clergy and doctors of the Church a divine gift, has been turned into a
   mock Gospel [or common thing]. [617]

   The plain meaning of this statement seems to be that Wyclif translated
   at least some of the Scriptures, that the translation was a novelty,
   and that the English was not a proper language for the embodiment of
   the sacred Word. It was a cleric's book, and profane temerity, by
   putting it within the reach of the laity, had vulgarized it.

   The work speedily received reprobation at the hands of the Church
   authorities. A bill presented in the English parliament, 1891, to
   condemn English versions, was rejected through the influence of the
   duke of Lancaster, but an Oxford synod, of 1408, passed the ominous
   act, that upon pain of greater excommunication, no man, by his own
   authority, should translate into English or any other tongue, until
   such translation were approved by the bishop, or, if necessary, by the
   provincial council. It distinctly mentions the translation "set forth
   in the time of John Wyclif." Writing to John XXIII., 1412, Archbishop
   Arundel took occasion to denounce "that pestilent wretch of damnable
   memory, yea, the forerunner and disciple of anti-christ who, as the
   complement of his wickedness, invented a new translation of the
   Scriptures into his mother-tongue." [618]

   In 1414, the reading of the English Scriptures was forbidden upon pain
   of forfeiture "of land, cattle, life and goods from their heirs
   forever." Such denunciations of a common English version were what
   Wyclif's own criticisms might have led us to expect, and quite in
   consonance with the decree of the Synod of Toulouse, 1229, and
   Arundel's reprobation has been frequently matched by prelatical
   condemnation of vernacular translations of the Bible and their
   circulation down to the papal fulminations of the 19th century against
   Bible societies, as by Pius VII., 1816, who declared them "fiendish
   institutions for the undermining of the foundation of religion." The
   position, taken by Catholic apologists, that the Catholic hierarchy has
   never set itself against the circulation of the Scriptures in the
   vernacular, but only against unauthorized translations, would be
   adapted to modify Protestantism's notion of the matter, if there were
   some evidence of only a limited attempt to encourage Bible study among
   the laity of the Catholic Church with the pages of Scripture open
   before them. If we go to the Catholic countries of Southern Europe and
   to South America, where her away has been unobstructed, the very
   opposite is true.

   In the clearest language, Wyclif charged the priestly authorities of
   his time with withholding the Word of God from the laity, and denying
   it to them in the language the people could understand. And the fact
   remains that, from his day until the reign of Elizabeth, Catholic
   England did not produce any translations of the Bible, and the English
   Reformers were of the opinion that the Catholic hierarchy was
   irrevocably set against English versions. Tyndale had to flee from
   England to translate his New Testament, and all the copies of the first
   edition that could be collected were burnt on English soil. And though
   it is alleged that Tyndale's New Testament was burnt because it was an
   "unauthorized" translation, it still remains true that the hierarchy
   made no attempt to give the Bible to England until long after the
   Protestant Reformation had begun and Protestantism was well
   established.

   The copies of Wyclif's and Purvey's versions seem to have been
   circulated in considerable numbers in England, and were in the
   possession of low and high. The Lollards cherished them. A splendid
   copy was given to the Carthusians of London by Henry VI., and another
   copy was in the possession of Henry VII. Sir Thomas More states
   distinctly that there was found in the possession of John Hunne, who
   was afterwards burnt, a Bible "written after Wyclif's copy and by him
   translated into our tongue." [619] While for a century and a half these
   volumes helped to keep alive the spirit of Wyclif in England, it is
   impossible to say how far Wyclif's version influenced the Protestant
   Reformers. In fact, it is unknown whether they used it at all. Some of
   its words, such as mote and beam and strait gate, which are found in
   the version of the 16th century, seem to indicate, to say the least,
   that these terms had become common property through the medium of
   Wyclif's version. [620] The priceless heirloom which English-speaking
   peoples possess in the English version and in an open Bible free to all
   who will read, learned and unlearned, lay and cleric, will continue to
   be associated with the Reformer of the 14th century. As has been said
   by one of the ablest of recent Wyclif students, Buddensieg, the call to
   honor the Scriptures as the Word of God and to study and diligently
   obey them, runs through Wyclif's writings like a scarlet thread. [621]
   Without knowing it, he departed diametrically from Augustine when he
   declared that the Scriptures do not depend for their authority upon the
   judgment of the Church, but upon Christ.

   In looking over the career and opinions of John Wyclif, it becomes
   evident that in almost every doctrinal particular did this man
   anticipate the Reformers. The more his utterances are studied, the
   stronger becomes this conviction. He exalted preaching; he insisted
   upon the circulation of the Scriptures among the laity; he demanded
   purity and fidelity of the clergy; he denied infallibility to the papal
   utterances, and went so far as to declare that the papacy is not
   essential to the being of the Church. He defined the Church as the
   congregation of the elect; he showed the unscriptural and unreasonable
   character of the doctrine of transubstantiation; he pronounced priestly
   absolution a declarative act. He dissented from the common notion about
   pilgrimages; he justified marriage on biblical grounds as honorable
   among all men; he appealed for liberty for the monk to renounce his
   vow, and to betake himself to some useful work.

   The doctrine of justification by faith Wyclif did not state. However,
   he constantly uses such expressions as, that to believe in Christ is
   life. The doctrine of merit is denied, and Christ's mediation is made
   all-sufficient. He approached close to the Reformers when he pronounced
   "faith the supreme theology,"--fides est summa theologia,--and that
   only by the study of the Scriptures is it possible to become a
   Christian. [622]

   Behind all Wyclif's other teaching is his devotion to Christ and his
   appeal to men to follow Him and obey His law. It is scarcely an
   exaggeration to say that the name of Christ appears on every page of
   his writings. To him, Christ was the supreme philosopher, yea, the
   content of all philosophy. [623]

   In reaching his views Wyclif was, so far as we know, as independent as
   any teacher can well be. There is no indication that he drew from any
   of the medieval sects, as has been charged, nor from Marsiglius and
   Ockam. He distinctly states that his peculiar views were drawn not from
   Ockam but from the Scriptures. [624]

   The Continental Reformers did not give to Wyclif the honor they gave to
   Huss. Had they known more about him, they might have said more. [625]
   Had Luther had access to the splendid shelf of volumes issued by the
   Wyclif Society, he might have said of the English Reformer what he said
   of Wessel's Works when they were put into his hands. The reason why no
   organized reformation followed Wyclif's labors is best given when we
   say, the time was not yet ripe. And, after all the parallelisms are
   stated between his opinions and the doctrines of the Reformers, it will
   remain true that, evangelical as he was in speech and patriotic as he
   was in spirit, the Englishman never ceased to be a Schoolman. Luther
   was fully a man of the new age.

   Note. - The Authorship of the First English Bible. Recently the
   priority of Wyclif's translation has been denied by Abbot Gasquet in
   two elaborate essays, The Old English Bible, pp. 87-155. He also
   pronounces it to be very doubtful if Wyclif ever translated any part of
   the Bible. All that can be attempted here is a brief statement of the
   case. In addition to Knighton's testimony, which seems to be as plain
   as language could put it, we have the testimony of John Huss in his
   Reply to the Carmelite Stokes, 1411, that Wyclif translated the whole
   Bible into English. No one contends that Wyclif did as much as this,
   and Huss was no doubt speaking in general terms, having in mind the
   originator of the work and the man's name connected with it. The doubt
   cast upon the first proposition, the priority of Wyclif's version, is
   due to Sir Thomas More's statement in his Dialogue, 1530, Works, p.
   233. In controverting the positions of Tyndale and the Reformers, he
   said, "The whole Bible was before Wyclif's days, by virtuous and
   well-learned men, translated into English and by good and godly people,
   with devotion and soberness, well and reverently read." He also says
   that he saw such copies. In considering this statement it seems very
   possible that More made a mistake (1) because the statement is contrary
   to Knighton's words, taken in their natural sense and Huss' testimony.
   (2) Because Wyclif's own statements exclude the existence of any
   English version before his own. (3) Because the Lollards associated
   their Bible with Wyclif's name. (4) Because before the era of the
   Reformation no English writer refers to any translating except in
   connection with Wyclif's name and time. Sir Thomas More was engaged in
   controversy and attempting to justify the position that the Catholic
   hierarchy had not been opposed to translations of the Scriptures nor to
   their circulation among proper classes of the laity. But Abbot Gasquet,
   after proposing a number of conjectural doubts and setting aside the
   natural sense of Knighton's and Arundel's statements, denies altogether
   the Wycliffite authorship of the Bible ascribed to him and edited by
   Forshall and Madden, and performs the feat of declaring this Bible one
   of the old translations mentioned by More. It must be stated here, a
   statement that will be recalled later, that Abbot Gasquet is the
   representative in England of the school of Janssen, which has
   endeavored to show that the Catholic Church was in an orderly process
   of development before Luther arose, and that Luther and the Reformers
   checked that development and also wilfully misrepresented the condition
   of the Church of their day. Dr. Gasquet, with fewer plausible facts and
   less literature at command than Janssen, seeks to present the English
   Church's condition in the later Middle Ages as a healthy one. And this
   he does (1) by referring to the existence of an English mediaeval
   literature, still in MSS., which he pronounces vast in its bulk; (2) by
   absolutely ignoring the statements of Wyclif; (3) by setting aside the
   testimonies of the English Reformers; (4) by disparaging the Lollards
   as a wholly humble and illiterate folk. Against all these witnesses he
   sets up the single witness, Sir Thomas More.

   The second proposition advocated by Dr. Gasquet that it is doubtful,
   and perhaps very improbable, that Wyclif did nothing in the way of
   translating the Bible, is based chiefly upon the fact that Wyclif does
   not refer to such a translation anywhere in his writings. If we take
   the abbot's own high priest among authorities, Sir Thomas More, the
   doubt is found to be unjustifiable, if not criminal. More, speaking of
   John Hunne, who was burnt, said that he possessed a copy of the Bible
   which was "after a Wycliffite copy." Eadie, I. 6O sqq.; Westcott, Hist.
   of the Eng. Bible. Gairdner who discusses the subject fairly in his
   Lollardy, I. 101-117, Capes, pp. 125-128, F. D. Matthew, in Eng. Hist.
   Rev., 1895, and Bigg, Wayside Sketches, p. 127 sq., take substantially
   the position taken by the author. Gasquet was preceded by Lingard,
   Hist. of Eng., IV. 196, who laid stress upon More's testimony to offset
   and disparage the honor given from time immemorial to Wyclif in
   connection with the English Bible.

   How can a controversialist be deemed fair who, in a discussion of this
   kind, does not even once refer to Wyclif's well-known views about the
   value of a popular knowledge of the Scriptures, and his urgency that
   they be given to all the people through plain preaching and in
   translation? Dr. Gasquet's attitude to "the strange personality of
   Wyclif" may be gotten from these words, Old Eng. Bible, p. 88:
   "Whatever we may hold as Catholics as to his unsound theological
   opinions, about which there can be no doubt, or, as peace-loving
   citizens, about his wild revolutionary social theories, on which, if
   possible, there can be less," etc.

   The following are two specimens of Wyclif's versions:--

   MATT. VIII. 23-27. And Jhesu steyinge vp in to a litel ship, his
   disciplis sueden him. And loo! a grete steryng was made in the see, so
   that the litil ship was hilid with wawis; but he slepte. And his
   disciplis camen nigh to hym, and raysiden hym, sayinge, Lord, saue vs:
   we perishen. And Jhesus seith to hem, What ben yhee of litil feith
   agast? Thanne he rysynge comaundide to the wyndis and the see, and a
   grete pesiblenesse is maad. Forsothe men wondreden, sayinge: What
   manere man is he this, for the wyndis and the see obeishen to hym.

   ROM. VIII. 5-8. For thei that ben aftir the fleisch saueren tho thingis
   that ben of the fleisch, but thei that ben aftir the spirit felen tho
   thingis that ben of the spirit. For the prudence of fleisch: is deeth,
   but the prudence of spirit: is liif and pees. For the wisdom of
   fleische is enemye to God, for it is not suget to the lawe of God: for
   nether it may. And thei that ben in fleisch: moun not please to God.

     __________________________________________________________________

   § 43. The Lollards.

   Although the impulse which Wyclif started in England did not issue
   there in a compact or permanent organization, it was felt for more than
   a century. Those who adopted his views were known as Wycliffites or
   Lollards, the Lollards being associated with the Reformer's name by the
   contemporary chroniclers, Knighton and Walsingham, and by Walden. [626]
   The former term gradually gave way to the latter, which was used to
   embrace all heretics in England.

   The term Lollards was transplanted to England from Holland and the
   region around Cologne. As early as 1300 Lollard heretics were classed
   by the authorities with the Beghards, Beguines, Fratricelli,
   Swestriones and even the Flagellants, as under the Church's ban. The
   origin of the word, like the term Huguenots, is a matter of dispute.
   The derivation from the Hollander, "Walter Lollard," who was burnt in
   Cologne, 1322, is now abandoned. [627] Contemporaries derived it from
   lolium,--tares,--and referred it to the false doctrine these sectarists
   were sowing, as does Knighton, and probably also Chaucer, or, with
   reference to their habit of song, from the Latin word laudare, to
   praise. [628] The most natural derivation is from the Low German,
   lullen or einlullen to sing to sleep, whence our English lullaby. None
   of the Lollard songs have come down to us. Scarcely a decade after
   Wyclif's death a bull was issued by Boniface IX., 1396, against the
   "Lullards or Beghards" of the Low Countries.

   The Wycliffite movement was suppressed by a rigid inquisition, set on
   foot by the bishops and sanctioned by parliament. Of the first
   generation of these heretics down to 1401, so far as they were brought
   to trial, the most, if not all, of them recanted. The 15th century
   furnished a great number of Lollard trials and a number of Lollard
   martyrs, and their number was added to in the early years of the 16th
   century. Active measures were taken by Archbishop Courtenay; and under
   his successor, Thomas, earl of Arundel, the full force of persecution
   was let loose. The warlike bishop of Norwich, Henry Spenser, joined
   heartily in the repressive crusade, swearing to put to death by the
   flames or by decapitation any of the dissenters who might presume to
   preach in his diocese. The reason for the general recantations of the
   first generation of Wyclif's followers has been found in the novelty of
   heresy trials in England and the appalling effect upon the accused,
   when for the first time they felt themselves confronted with the whole
   power of the hierarchy. [629]

   In 1394, they were strong enough to present a petition in full
   parliament, containing twelve Conclusions. [630] These propositions
   called the Roman Church the stepmother of the Church in England,
   declared that many who had priestly ordination were not ordained of
   God, took up the evils growing out of enforced celibacy, denied
   Christ's material presence in the eucharist, condemned pilgrimages and
   image-worship, and pronounced priestly confession and indulgences
   measures invented for the profit of the clergy. The use of mitres,
   crosses, oil and incense was condemned and also war, on the ground that
   warriors, after the first blood is let, lose all charity, and so "go
   straight to hell." In addition to the Bible, the document quotes
   Wyclif's Trialogus by name.

   From about 1390 to 1425, we hear of the Lollards in all directions, so
   that the contemporary chronicler was able to say that of every two men
   found on the roads, one was sure to be a Lollard. [631] With the
   accession of Henry IV. of Lancaster (1399-1413), a severe policy was
   adopted. The culminating point of legislation was reached in 1401, when
   parliament passed the act for the burning of heretics, the first act of
   the kind in England. [632] The statute referred to the Lollards as a
   new sect, damnably thinking of the faith of the Church in respect to
   the sacraments and, against the law of God and the Church, usurping the
   office of preaching. It forbade this people to preach, hold schools and
   conventicles and issue books. The violators were to be tried in the
   diocesan courts and, if found guilty and refusing to abjure, were to be
   turned over to the civil officer and burnt. The burning, so it was
   stipulated, was to be on a high place where the punishment might be
   witnessed and the onlookers be struck with fear.

   The most prominent personages connected with the earliest period of
   Wycliffism, Philip Repyngdon, John Ashton, Nicolas Hereford and John
   Purvey, all recanted. The last three and Wyclif are associated by
   Knighton as the four arch-heretics.

   Repyngdon, who had boldly declared himself at Oxford for Wyclif and his
   view of the sacrament, made a full recantation, 1382. Subsequently he
   was in high favor, became chancellor of Oxford, bishop of Lincoln and a
   cardinal, 1408. He showed the ardor of his zeal by treating with
   severity the sect whose views he had once espoused.

   John Ashton had been one of the most active of Wyclif's preachers. In
   setting forth his heretical zeal, Knighton describes him as "leaping up
   from his bed and, like a dog, ready to bark at the slightest sound." He
   finally submitted in Courtenay's court, professing that he "believed as
   our modur, holy kirke, believes," and that in the sacrament the priest
   has in his hand Christ's very body. He was restored to his privileges
   as lecturer in Oxford, but afterwards fell again into heretical
   company. [633]

   Hereford, Wyclif's fellow-translator, appealed to Rome, was condemned
   there and cast into prison. After two years of confinement, he escaped
   to England and, after being again imprisoned, made his peace with the
   Church and died a Carthusian.

   In 1389, nine Lollards recanted before Courtenay, at Leicester. The
   popular preacher, William Swynderby, to whose sermons in Leicester the
   people flocked from every quarter, made an abject recantation, but
   later returned to his old ways, and was tried in 1891 and convicted.
   Whether he was burnt or died in prison, Foxe says, he could not
   ascertain.

   The number suffering death by the law of 1401 was not large in the
   aggregate. The victims were distributed through the 125 years down to
   the middle of Henry VIII.'s reign. There were among them no clergymen
   of high renown like Ridley and Latimer. The Lollards were an humble
   folk, but by their persistence showed the deep impression Wyclif's
   teachings had made. The first martyr, the poor chaplain of St. Osythe,
   William Sawtré, died March 2, 1401, before the statute for burning
   heretics was passed. He abjured and then returned again to his
   heretical views. After trying him, the spiritual court ordered the
   mayor or sheriff of London to "commit him to the fire that he be
   actually burnt." [634] The charges were that he denied the material
   presence, condemned the adoration of the cross and taught that
   preaching was the priesthood's most important duty.

   Among other cases of burnings were John Badby, a tailor of Evesham,
   1410, who met his awful fate chained inside of a cask; two London
   merchants, Richard Turming and John Claydon at Smithfield, 1415;
   William Taylor, a priest, in 1423 at Smithfield; William White at
   Norwich, 1428; Richard Hoveden, a London citizen, 1430; Thomas Bagley,
   a priest, in the following year; and in 1440, Richard Wyche, who had
   corresponded with Huss. Peter Payne, the principal of St. Edmund's
   College, Oxford, took refuge in flight, 1417, and became a leader among
   the Hussites, taking a prominent part as their representative at the
   Council of Basel. According to Foxe there were, 1424-1480, 100
   prosecutions for heresy in Norwich alone. The menace was considered so
   great that, in 1427, Richard Flemmyng, bishop of Lincoln, founded
   Lincoln College, Oxford, to counteract heresy. It was of this college
   that John Wesley was a fellow, the man who made a great breach in the
   Church in England.

   The case of William Thorpe, who was tried in 1397 and again before
   Arundel, 1407, is of interest not only in itself, but for the
   statements that were made in the second trial about Wyclif. The
   archbishop, after accusing Thorpe of having travelled about in Northern
   England for 20 years, spreading the infection of heresy, declared that
   he was called of God to destroy the false sect to which the prisoner
   belonged, and pledged himself to "punish it so narrowly as not to leave
   a slip of you in this land." [635] Thorpe's assertion that Wyclif was
   the greatest clerk of his time evoked from Arundel the acknowledgment
   that he was indeed a great clerk and, by the consent of many, "a
   perfect liver," but that many of the conclusions of his learning were
   damned, as they ought to be.

   Up to the close of the 14th century, a number of laymen in high
   position at court had favored Wycliffism, including Sir Lewis Clifford,
   Sir Richard Stury and Sir John Clanvowe, all of the king's council, Sir
   John Cheyne, speaker of the lower house, the Lord Chancellor, Sir
   Thomas Erpingham and also the earl of Salisbury. [636] This support was
   for the most part withdrawn when persecution took an active form. With
   Sir John Oldcastle, otherwise known as Lord Cobham from his marriage
   with the heiress of the Cobham estate, it was different. He held firm
   to the end, encouraged the new preachers on his estates in Kent, and
   condemned the mass, auricular confession and the worship of images.
   Arundel's court, before which he appeared after repeated citations,
   turned him over to the secular arm "to do him to death." Oldcastle was
   imprisoned in the Tower, but made his escape and was at large for four
   years. In 1414, he was charged with being a party to an uprising of
   20,000 Lollards against the king. Declared an outlaw, he fled to Wales,
   where he was seized three years later and taken to London to be hanged
   and burnt as a traitor and heretic, Dec. 15, 1417. [637] John Foxe saw
   in him "the blessed martyr of Christ, the good Lord Cobham."

   It is a pleasant relief from these trials and puttings-to-death to find
   the University of Oxford in 1406 bearing good testimony to the memory
   of its maligned yet distinguished dead, placing on record its high
   sense of his purity of life, power in preaching and diligence in
   studies. But fragrant as his memory was held in Oxford, at least
   secretly, parliament was fixed in its purpose to support the
   ecclesiastical authorities in stamping out his doctrine. In 1414, it
   ordered the civil officer to take the initiative in ferreting out
   heresy, and magistrates, from the Lord chancellor down, were called
   upon to use their power in extirpating "all manner of heresies, errors
   and lollardies." This oath continued to be administered for two
   centuries, until Sir Edward Coke, Lord High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire,
   refused to take it, with the name Lollard included, insisting that the
   principles of Lollardy had been adopted by the Church of England. [638]

   Archbishop Chichele seemed as much bent as his predecessor, Arundel, on
   clearing the realm of all stain of heresy. In 1416 he enjoined his
   suffragans to inquire diligently twice a year for persons under
   suspicion and, where they did not turn them over to the secular court,
   to commit them to perpetual or temporary imprisonment, as the nature of
   the case might require. It was about the same time that an Englishman,
   at the trial of Huss in Constance, after a parallel had been drawn
   between Wyclif's views and those of the Bohemian, said, "By my soul, if
   I were in your place I would abjure, for in England all the masters,
   one after another, albeit very good men, when suspected of Wicliffism,
   abjured at the command of the archbishop." [639]

   Heresy also penetrated into Scotland, James Resby, one of Wyclif's poor
   priests, being burnt at Perth, 1407, and another at Glasgow, 1422. In
   1488, a Bohemian student at St. Andrews, Paul Craw, suffered the same
   penalty for heresy. [640] The Scotch parliament of 1425 enjoined
   bishops to make search for heretics and Lollards, and in 1416 every
   master of arts at St. Andrews was obliged to take an oath to defend the
   Church against them.

   Between 1450-1517, Lollardy was almost wholly restricted to the rural
   districts, and little mention is made of it in contemporary records. At
   Amersham, one of its centres, four were tried in 1462, and some
   suffered death, as William Barlowe in 1466, and John Goose a few years
   later. In 1507, three were burnt there, including William Tylsworth,
   the leading man of the congregation. At the crucial moment he was
   deserted by the members, and sixty of them joined in carrying fagots
   for his burning. This time of recantation continued to be known in the
   district as the Great Abjuration. The first woman to suffer martyrdom
   in England, Joan Broughton, was burnt at Smithfield, 1494, as was also
   her daughter, Lady Young. Nine Lollards made public penance at
   Coventry, 1486, but, as late as 1519, six men and one woman suffered
   death there. Foxe also mentions William Sweeting and John Brewster as
   being burnt at Smithfield, 1511, and John Brown at Ashford the same
   year. How extensively Wyclif's views continued to be secretly held and
   his writings read is a matter of conjecture. Not till 1559 was the
   legislation directed against Lollardy repealed.

   Our knowledge of the tenets and practices of the Lollards is derived
   from their Twelve Conclusions and other Lollard documents, the records
   of their trials and from the Repressor for over-much Blaming of the
   Clergy, an English treatise written by Dr. Pecock, bishop of
   Chichester, and finished 1455. Inclined to liberal thought, Bishop
   Pecock assumed a different attitude from Courtenay, Arundel and other
   prelates, and sought by calm reasoning to win the Lollards from their
   mistakes. He mentioned the designation of Known Men--1 Cor. 14:38, 2
   Tim. 2:19--as being one of old standing for them, and he also calls
   them "the lay party" or "the Bible Men." He proposed to consider their
   objections against 11 customs and institutions, such as the worship of
   images, pilgrimages, landed endowments for the church, degrees of rank
   among the clergy, the religious orders, the mass, oaths and war. Their
   tenet that no statute is valid which is not found in the Scriptures he
   also attempted to confute. In advance of his age, the bishop declared
   that fire, the sword and hanging should not be resorted to till the
   effort had been made "by clene wit to draw the Lollards into the
   consent of the true faith." His sensible counsel brought him into
   trouble, and in 1457 he was tried by Archbishop Bouchier and offered
   the alternative of burning or public recantation. Pecock chose the
   latter, and made abjuration at St. Paul's Cross before the archbishop
   and thousands of spectators. He was clothed in full episcopal robes,
   and delivered up 14 of his writings to be burnt. [641] He was forced to
   resign his see, and in 1459 was, at the pope's instance, remanded to
   close confinement in Thorney Abbey. His Repressor had been twice burnt
   in Oxford.

   There seems to have been agreement among the Lollards in denying the
   material presence of Christ in the eucharistic bread and in condemning
   pilgrimages, the worship of images and auricular confession. They also
   held to the right of the people to read the Scriptures in their own
   tongue. [642] The expression, God's law, was widely current among them,
   and was opposed to the canon law and the decisions of the Church
   courts. Some denied purgatory, and even based their salvation on faith,
   [643] the words, "Thy faith hath saved thee," being quoted for this
   view. Some denied that the marriage bond was dependent upon the
   priest's act, and more the scriptural warrant and expediency of
   priestly celibacy. [644]

   Lollardy was an anticipation of the Reformation of the sixteenth
   century, and did something in the way of preparing the mind of the
   English people for that change. Professed by many clerics, it was
   emphatically a movement of laymen. In the early Reformation period,
   English Lutherans were at times represented as the immediate followers
   of Wyclif. Writing in 1523 to Erasmus, Tonstall, bishop of London, said
   of Lutheranism that "it was not a question of some pernicious novelty,
   but only that new arms were being added to the great band of Wycliffite
   heretics." [645]

   § 44. John Huss of Bohemia.

   Across the seas in Bohemia, where the views of Wyclif were
   transplanted, they took deeper root than in England, and assumed an
   organized form. There, the English Reformer was called the fifth
   evangelist and, in its earlier stages, the movement went by the name of
   Wycliffism. It was only in the later periods that the names Hussites
   and Hussitism were substituted for Wycliffites and Wycliffism. Its
   chief spokesmen were John Huss and Jerome of Prag, who died at the
   stake at Constance for their avowed allegiance to Wyclif.

   Through Huss, Prag became identified with a distinct stage in the
   history of religious progress. Distinguished among its own people as
   the city of St. John of Nepomuk, d. 1383, and in the history of armies
   as the residence of Wallenstein, the Catholic leader in the Thirty
   Years' War, Prag is known in the Western world pre-eminently as the
   home of Huss. Through his noble advocacy, the principles enunciated by
   Wyclif became the subject of discussion in oecumenical councils, called
   forth armed crusades and furnished an imposing spectacle of steadfast
   resistance against religious oppression. Wycliffism passed out of view
   in England; but Hussitism, in spite of the most bitter persecution by
   the Jesuits, has trickled down in pure though small streamlets into the
   religious history of modern times, notably through the Moravians of
   Herrnhut.

   During the reign of Charles IV., king of Bohemia and emperor,
   1346-1378, the Bohemian kingdom entered upon the


   [picture with title below]

   John Huss of Bohemia

   golden era of its literary and religious history. In 1344, the
   archbishopric of Prag was created, and the year 1347 witnessed an event
   of far more than local importance in the founding of the University of
   Prag. The first of the German universities, it was forthwith to enter
   upon the era of its brightest fame. The Czech and German languages were
   spoken side by side in the city, which was divided, at the close of the
   14th century into five quarters. The Old Town, inhabited chiefly by
   Germans, included the Teyn church, the Carolinum, the Bethlehem chapel
   and the ancient churches of St. Michael and St. Gallus. Under the first
   archbishop of Prag, Arnest of Pardubitz, and his successor Ocko of
   Wlaschim, a brave effort was made to correct ecclesiastical abuses. In
   1355, the demand for popular instruction was recognized by a law
   requiring parish priests to preach in the Czech. The popular preachers,
   Konrad of Waldhausen, d. 1369, Militz of Kremsier, d. 1874, and
   Matthias of Janow, d. 1394, made a deep impression. They quoted at
   length from the Scriptures, urged the habit of frequent communion, and
   Janow, as reported by Rokyzana at the Council of Basel, 1433, seems to
   have administered the cup to the laity. [646] When John Huss entered
   upon his career in the university, he was breathing the atmosphere
   generated by these fervent evangelists, although in his writings he
   nowhere quotes them.

   Close communication between England and Bohemia had been established
   with the marriage of the Bohemian king Wenzel's sister, Anne of
   Luxemburg, to Richard II., 1382. She was a princess of cultivated
   tastes, and had in her possession copies of the Scriptures in Latin,
   Czech and German. Before this nuptial event, the philosophical faculty
   of the University of Prag, in 1367, ordered its bachelors to add to the
   instructions of its own professors the notebooks of Paris and Oxford
   doctors. Here and there a student sought out the English university, or
   even went so far as the Scotch St. Andrews. Among those who studied in
   Oxford was Jerome of Prag. Thus a bridge for the transmission of
   intellectual products was laid from Wyclif's lecture hall to the
   capital on the Moldau. [647] Wyclif's views and writings were known in
   Bohemia at an early date. In 1381 a learned Bohemian theologian,
   Nicolas Biceps, was acquainted with his leading principles and made
   them a subject of attack. Huss, in his reply to the English Carmelite,
   John Stokes, 1411, declared that he and the members of the university
   had had Wyclif's writings in their hands and been reading them for 20
   years and more. [648] Five copies are extant of these writings, made in
   Huss' own hand, 1398. They were carried away in the Thirty Years' War
   and are preserved in the Royal Library of Stockholm.

   John Huss was born of Czech parents, 1369, at Husinec in Southern
   Bohemia. The word Hus means goose, and its distinguished bearer often
   applied the literal meaning to himself. For example, he wrote from
   Constance expressing the hope that the Goose might be delivered from
   prison, and he bade the Bohemians, "if they loved the Goose," to secure
   the king's aid in having him released. Friends also referred to him in
   the same way. [649] His parents were poor and, during his studies in
   the University of Prag, he supported himself by singing and manual
   services. He took the degree of bachelor of arts in 1393 and of
   divinity a year later. In 1396 he incepted as master of arts, and in
   1398 began delivering lectures in the university. In 1402 he was chosen
   rector, filling the office for six months.

   With his academic duties Huss combined the activity of a preacher, and
   in 1402 was appointed to the rectorship of the Chapel of the Holy
   Innocents of Bethlehem. This church, usually known as the Bethlehem
   church, was founded in 1391 by two wealthy laymen, with the stipulation
   that the incumbent should preach every Sunday and on festival days in
   Czech. It was made famous by its new rector as the little church,
   Anastasia, in Constantinople, was made famous in the fourth century by
   Gregory of Nazianzus, and by his discourses against the Arian heresy.

   As early as 1402, Huss was regarded as the chief exponent and defender
   of Wycliffian views at the university. Protests, made by the clergy
   against their spread, took definite form in 1403, when the university
   authorities condemned the 24 articles placed under the ban by the
   London council of 1382. At the same time 21 other articles were
   condemned, which one of the university masters, John Hübner, a Pole,
   professed to have extracted from the Englishman's writings. The
   decision forbade the preaching and teaching of these 45 articles. Among
   Wyclif's warm defenders were Stanislaus of Znaim and Stephen Paletz.
   The subject which gave the most offence was his doctrine of the Lord's
   Supper.

   A distinct stage in the religious controversies agitating Bohemia was
   introduced by the election of Sbinko of Hasenburg to the see of Prag,
   1403. In the earlier years of his administration Huss had the prelate's
   confidence, held the post of synodal preacher and was encouraged to
   bring to the archbishop's notice abuses that might be reformed. He was
   also appointed one of a commission of three to investigate the alleged
   miracles performed by the relic of Christ's blood at Wylsnak and
   attracting great throngs. The report condemned the miracles as a fraud.
   The matter, however, became subject of discussion at the university and
   as far away as Vienna and Erfurt, the question assuming the form
   whether Christ left any of his blood on the earth. In a tract entitled
   the Glorification of all Christ's Blood, [650] Huss took the negative
   side. In spite of him and of the commission's report, the miracles at
   Wylsnak went on, until, in 1552, a zealous Lutheran broke the pyx which
   held the relic and burnt it.

   So extensive was the spread of Wycliffism that Innocent VII., in 1405,
   called upon Sbinko to employ severe measures to stamp it out and to
   seize Wyclif's writings. The same year a Prag synod forbade the
   propaganda of Wyclif's views and renewed the condemnation of the 45
   articles. Three years later Huss--whose activity in denouncing clerical
   abuses and advocating Wyclif's theology knew no abatement--was deposed
   from the position of synodal preacher. The same year the University
   authorities, at the archbishop's instance, ordered that no public
   lectures should be delivered on Wyclif's Trialogus and Dialogus and his
   doctrine of the Supper, and that no public disputation should concern
   itself with any of the condemned 45 articles.

   The year following, 1409, occurred the emigration from the university
   of the three nations, the Bavarians, Saxons and Poles, the Czechs alone
   being left. The bitter feeling of the Bohemians had expressed itself in
   the demand for three votes, while the other nations were to be
   restricted to one each. When Wenzel consented to this demand, 2000
   masters and scholars withdrew, the Germans going to Leipzig and
   founding the university of that city. The University of Prag was at
   once reduced to a provincial school of 500 students, and has never
   since regained its prestige. [651]

   Huss, a vigorous advocate of the use of the Czech, was the recognized
   head of the national movement at the university, and chosen first
   rector under the new régime. If possible, his advocacy of Wyclif and
   his views was more bold than before. From this time forth, his Latin
   writings were filled with excerpts from the English teacher and teem
   with his ideas. Wyclif's writings were sown broadcast in Bohemia. Huss
   himself had translated the Trialogus into Czech. Throngs were attracted
   by preaching. Wherever, wrote Huss in 1410, in city or town, in village
   or castle, the preacher of the holy truth made his appearance, the
   people flocked together in crowds and in spite of the clergy. [652]

   Following a bull issued by Alexander V., Sbinko, in 1410, ordered
   Wyclif's writings seized and burnt, and forbade all preaching in
   unauthorized places. The papal document called forth the protest of
   Huss and others, who appealed to John XXIII. by showing the absurdity
   of burning books on philosophy, logic and other non-theological
   subjects, a course that would condemn the writings of Aristotle and
   Origen to the flames. The protest was in vain and 200 manuscript copies
   of the Reformer's writings were cast into the flames in the courtyard
   of the archiepiscopal palace amidst the tolling of the church bells.
   [653]

   Two days after this grewsome act, the sentence of excommunication was
   launched against Huss and all who might persist in refusing to deliver
   up Wyclif's writings. Defying the archbishop and the papal bull, Huss
   continued preaching in the Bethlehem chapel. The excitement among all
   classes was intense and men were cudgelled on the streets for speaking
   against the Englishman. Satirical ballads were sung, declaring that the
   archbishop did not know what was in the books he had set fire to. Huss'
   sermons, far from allaying the commotion, were adapted to increase it.

   Huss had no thought of submission and, through handbills, announced a
   defence of Wyclif's treatise on the Trinity before the university, July
   27. But his case had now passed from the archbishop's jurisdiction to
   the court of the curia, which demanded the offender's appearance in
   person, but in vain. In spite of the appeals of Wenzel and many
   Bohemian nobles who pledged their honor that he was no heretic, John
   XXIII. put the case into the hands of Cardinal Colonna, afterwards
   Martin V., who launched the ban against Huss for his refusal to comply
   with the canonical citation.

   Colonna's sentence was read from all the pulpits of Prag except two.
   But the offensive preaching continued, and Sbinko laid the city under
   the interdict, which, however, was withdrawn on the king's promise to
   root out heresy from his realm. Wenzel gave orders that "Master Huss,
   our beloved and faithful chaplain, be allowed to preach the Word of God
   in peace." According to the agreement, Sbinko was also to write to the
   pope assuring him that diligent inquisition had been made, and no
   traces of heresy were to be found in Bohemia. This letter is still
   extant, but was never sent.

   Early in September, 1411, Huss wrote to John XXIII. protesting his full
   agreement with the Church and asking that the citation to appear before
   the curia be revoked. In this communication and in a special letter to
   the cardinals [654] Huss spoke of the punishment for heresy and
   insubordination. He, however, wrote to John that he was bound to speak
   the truth, and that he was ready to suffer a dreadful death rather than
   to declare what would be contrary to the will of Christ and his Church.
   He had been defamed, and it was false that he had expressed himself in
   favor of the remanence of the material substance of the bread after the
   words of institution, and that a priest in mortal sin might not
   celebrate the eucharist. Sbinko died Sept. 28, 1411. At this juncture
   the excitement was increased by the arrival in Prag of John Stokes, a
   Cambridge man, and well known in England as an uncompromising foe of
   Wycliffism. He had come with a delegation, sent by the English king, to
   arrange an alliance with Sigismund. Stokes' presence aroused the
   expectation of a notable clash, but the Englishman, although he
   ventilated his views privately, declined Huss' challenge to a public
   disputation on the ground that he was a political representative of a
   friendly nation. [655]

   The same year, 1411, John XXIII. called Europe to a crusade against
   Ladislaus of Naples, the defender of Gregory XII., and promised
   indulgence to all participating in it, whether by personal enlistment
   or by gifts. Tiem, dean of Passau, appointed preacher of the holy war,
   made his way to Prag and opened the sale of indulgences. Chests were
   placed in the great churches, and the traffic was soon in full sway. As
   Wyclif, thirty years before, in his Cruciata, had lifted up his voice
   against the crusade in Flanders, so now Huss denounced the religious
   war and denied the pope's right to couple indulgences with it. He
   filled the Bethlehem chapel with denunciations of the sale and, in a
   public disputation, took the ground that remission of sins comes
   through repentance alone and that the pope has no authority to seize
   the secular sword. Many of his paragraphs were taken bodily from
   Wyclif's works on the Church and on the Absolution from guilt and
   punishment. [656] Huss was supported by Jerome of Prag.

   Popular opinion was on the side of these leaders, but from this time
   Huss' old friends, Stanislaus of Znaim and Stephen Paletz, walked no
   more with him. Under the direction of Wok of Waldstein, John's two
   bulls, bearing on the crusade and offering indulgence, were publicly
   burnt, after being hung at the necks of two students, dressed as
   harlots, and drawn through the streets in a cart. [657] Huss was still
   writing that he abhorred the errors ascribed to him, but the king could
   not countenance the flagrant indignity shown to the papal bulls, and
   had three men of humble position executed, Martin, John and Stanislaus.
   They had cried out in open church that the bulls were lies, as Huss had
   proved. They were treated as martyrs, and their bodies taken to the
   Bethlehem chapel, where the mass for martyrs was said over them.

   To reaffirm its orthodoxy, the theological faculty renewed its
   condemnation of the 45 articles and added 6 more, taken from Huss'
   public utterances. Two of the latter bore upon preaching. [658] The
   clergy of Prag appealed to be protected "from the ravages of the wolf,
   the Wycliffist Hus, the despiser of the keys," and the curia pronounced
   the greater excommunication. The heretic was ordered seized, delivered
   over to the archbishop, and the Bethlehem chapel razed to the ground.
   Three stones were to be hurled against Huss' dwelling, as a sign of
   perpetual curse. Thus the Reformer had against him the archbishop, the
   university, the clergy and the curia, but popular feeling remained in
   his favor and prevented the papal sentence from being carried out. The
   city was again placed under the interdict. Huss appealed from the pope
   and, because a general council's action is always uncertain and at best
   tardy, looked at once to the tribunal of Christ. He publicly asserted
   that the pope was exercising prerogatives received from the devil.

   To allay the excitement, Wenzel induced Huss to withdraw from the city.
   This was in 1412. In later years Huss expressed doubts as to whether he
   had acted wisely in complying. He was moved not only by regard for the
   authority of his royal protector but by sympathy for the people whom
   the interdict was depriving of spiritual privileges. Had he defied the
   sentence and refused compliance with the king's request, it is probable
   he would have lost the day and been silenced in prison or in the flames
   in his native city. In this case, the interest of his career would have
   been restricted to the annals of his native land, and no place would
   have been found for him in the general history of Europe. So Huss went
   into exile, but there was still some division among the ecclesiastical
   authorities of the kingdom over the merits of Wycliffism, and a
   national synod, convoked February 13, 1413, to take measures to secure
   peace, adjourned without coming to a decision.

   Removed from Prag, Huss was indefatigable in preaching and writing.
   Audiences gathered to hear him on the marketplaces and in the fields
   and woods. Lords in their strong castles protected him. Following
   Wyclif, he insisted upon preaching as the indefeasible right of the
   priest, and wrote that to cease from preaching, in obedience to the
   mandate of pope or archbishop, would be to disobey God and imperil his
   own salvation. [659] He also kept in communication with the city by
   visiting it several times and by writing to the Bethlehem chapel, the
   university and the municipal synod. This correspondence abounds in
   quotations from the Scriptures, and Huss reminds his friends that
   Christ himself was excommunicated as a malefactor and crucified. No
   help was to be derived from the saints. Christ's example and his
   salvation are the sufficient sources of consolation and courage. The
   high priests, scribes, Pharisees, Herod and Pilate condemned the Truth
   and gave him over to death, but he rose from the tomb and gave in his
   stead twelve other preachers. So he would do again. What fear, he
   wrote, "shall part us from God, or what death? What shall we lose if
   for His sake we forfeit wealth, friends, the world's honors and our
   poor life?... It is better to die well than to live badly. We dare not
   sin to avoid the punishment of death. To end in grace the present life
   is to be banished from misery. Truth is the last conqueror. He wins who
   is slain, for no adversity "hurts him if no iniquity has dominion over
   him." In this strain he wrote again and again. The "bolts of
   anti-christ," he said, could not terrify him, and should not terrify
   the "elect of Prag." [660]

   Of the extent of Huss' influence during this period he bore witness at
   Constance when, in answer to D'Ailly, he said:

   I have stated that I came here of my own free will. If I had been
   unwilling to come, neither that king [referring to Wenzel] nor this
   king here [referring to Sigismund] would have been able to force me to
   come, so numerous and so powerful are the Bohemian nobles who love me,
   and within whose castles I should have been able to lie concealed.

   And when D'Ailly rebuked the statement as effrontery, John of Chlum
   replied that it was even as the prisoner said, "There are numbers of
   great nobles who love him and have strong castles where they could keep
   him as long as they wished, even against both those kings."

   The chief product of this period of exile was Huss' work on the Church,
   De ecclesia, the most noted of all his writings. It was written in view
   of the national synod held in 1413, and was sent to Prag and read in
   the Bethlehem chapel, July 8. Of this tractate Cardinal D'Ailly said at
   the Council of Constance that by an infinite number of arguments, it
   combated the pope's plenary authority as much as the Koran, the book of
   the damned Mohammed, combated the Catholic faith. [661]

   In this volume, next to Wyclif's, the most famous treatment on the
   Church since Cyprian's work, De ecclesia, and Augustine's writings
   against the Donatists, Huss defined the Church and the power of the
   keys, and then proceeds to defend himself against the fulminations of
   Alexander V. and John XXIII. and to answer the Prag theologians,
   Stephen Paletz and Stanislaus of Znaim, who had deserted him. The
   following are some of its leading positions.

   The Holy Catholic Church is the body or congregation of all the
   predestinate, the dead, the living and those yet to be. [662] The term
   'catholic' means universal. The unity of the Church is a unity of
   predestination and of blessedness, a unity of faith, charity and grace.
   The Roman pontiff and the cardinals are not the Church. The Church can
   exist without cardinals and a pope, and in fact for hundreds of years
   there were no cardinals. [663] As for the position Christ assigned to
   Peter, Huss affirmed that Christ called himself the Rock, and the
   Church is founded on him by virtue of predestination. In view of
   Peter's clear and positive confession, "the Rock--Petra -- said to
   Peter--Petro -- 'I say unto thee, Thou art Peter, that is, a confessor
   of the true Rock which Rock I am.' And upon the Rock, that is, myself,
   I will build this Church." Thus Huss placed himself firmly on the
   ground taken by Augustine in his Retractations. Peter never was the
   head of the Holy Catholic Church. [664]

   He thus set himself clearly against the whole ultramontane theory of
   the Church and its head. The Roman bishop, he said, was on an equality
   with other bishops until Constantine made him pope. It was then that he
   began to usurp authority. Through ignorance and the love of money the
   pope may err, and has erred, and to rebel against an erring pope is to
   obey Christ. [665] There have been depraved and heretical popes. Such
   was Joan, whose case Huss dwelt upon at length and refers to at least
   three times. Such was also the case of Liberius, who is also treated at
   length. Joan had a son and Liberius was an Arian. [666]

   In the second part of the De ecclesia, Huss pronounced the bulls of
   Alexander and John XXIII. anti-christian, and therefore not to be
   obeyed. Alexander's bull, prohibiting preaching in Bohemia except in
   the cathedral, parish and monastic churches was against the Gospel, for
   Christ preached in houses, on the seaside, and in synagogues, and bade
   his disciples to go into all the world and preach. No papal
   excommunication may be an impediment to doing what Christ did and
   taught to be done. [667]

   Turning to the pope's right to issue indulgences, the Reformer went
   over the ground he had already traversed in his replies to John's two
   bulls calling for a crusade against Ladislaus. He denied the pope's
   right to go to war or to make appeal to the secular sword. If John was
   minded to follow Christ, he should pray for his enemies and say, "My
   kingdom is not of this world." Then the promised wisdom would be given
   which no enemies would be able to gainsay. The power to forgive sins
   belongs to no mortal man anymore than it belonged to the priest to whom
   Christ sent the lepers. The lepers were cleansed before they reached
   the priest. Indeed, many popes who conceded the most ample indulgences
   were themselves damned. [668] Confession of the heart alone is
   sufficient for the soul's salvation where the applicant is truly
   penitent.

   In denying the infallibility of the pope and of the Church visible, and
   in setting aside the sacerdotal power of the priesthood to open and
   shut the kingdom of heaven, Huss broke with the accepted theory of
   Western Christendom; he committed the unpardonable sin of the Middle
   Ages. These fundamental ideas, however, were not original with the
   Bohemian Reformer. He took them out of Wyclif's writings, and he also
   incorporated whole paragraphs of those writings in his pages. Teacher
   never had a more devoted pupil than the English Reformer had in Huss.
   The first three chapters of De ecclesia are little more than a series
   of extracts from Wyclif's treatise on the Church. What is true of this
   work is also true of most of Huss' other Latin writings. [669] Huss,
   however, was not a mere copyist. The ideas he got from Wyclif he made
   thoroughly his own. When he quoted Augustine, Bernard, Jerome and other
   writers, he mentioned them by name. If he did not mention Wyclif, when
   he took from him arguments and entire paragraphs, a good reason can be
   assigned for his silence. It was well known that it was Wyclif's cause
   which he was representing and Wycliffian views that he was defending,
   and Wyclif's writings were wide open to the eye of members of the
   university faculties. He made no secret of following Wyclif, and being
   willing to die for the views Wyclif taught. As he wrote to Richard
   Wyche, he was thankful that "under the power of Jesus Christ, Bohemia
   had received so much good from the blessed land of England." [670]

   The Bohemian theologian was fully imbued with Wyclif's heretical
   spirit. The great Council of Constance was about to meet. Before that
   tribunal Huss was now to be judged.

   affirms that in his Latin tractates Huss "has drawn all his arguments

   from his English predecessor," pp. xiv, 139, 141, 156, etc. Neander
   made a mistake in rating the influence of Matthias of Janow upon Huss
   higher than the influence of Wyclif. He wrote before the Wyclif Society
   began its publications. Even Palacky, in his Church History of Bohemia,
   III. 190-197, pronounced it uncertain how far Huss was influenced by
   Wyclif's writings, and questions whether he had attached himself
   closely to the English Reformer. The publications of the Wyclif
   Society, which make a comparison possible, show that one writer could
   scarcely be more dependent upon another than Huss was upon Wyclif.

   § 45. Huss at Constance.


   Thou wast their Rock, their fortress and their might;

   Thou, Lord, their captain in the well-fought fight;

   Thou, in the darkness drear, their light of light. Alleluia.

   The great expectations aroused by the assembling of the Council of
   Constance included the settlement of the disturbance which was rending
   the kingdom of Bohemia. It was well understood that measures were to be
   taken against the heresy which had invaded Western Christendom. In two
   letters addressed to Conrad, archbishop of Prag, Gerson bore witness
   that, in learned centres outside of Bohemia, the names of Wyclif and
   Huss were indissolubly joined. Of all Huss' errors, wrote the
   chancellor, "the proposition is the most perilous that a man who is
   living in deadly sin may not have authority and dominion over Christian
   men. And this proposition, as is well known, has passed down to Huss
   from Wyclif." [671]

   To Constance Sigismund, king of the Romans and heir of the Bohemian
   crown, turned for relief from the embarrassment of Hussitism; and from
   Lombardy he sent a deputation to summon Huss to attend the council at
   the same time promising him safe conduct. The Reformer expressed his
   readiness to go, and had handbills posted in Prag announcing his
   decision. Writing to Wenzel and his queen, he reaffirmed his readiness,
   and stated he was willing to suffer the penalty appointed for heretics,
   should he be condemned. [672]

   Under date of Sept. 1, 1414, Huss wrote to Sigismund that he was ready
   to go to Constance "under safe-conduct of your protection, the Lord
   Most High being my defender." A week later, the king replied,
   expressing confidence that, by his appearance, all imputation of heresy
   would be removed from the kingdom of Bohemia.

   Huss set out on the journey Oct. 11, 1414, and reached Constance Nov.
   3. He was accompanied by the Bohemian nobles, John of Chlum, Wenzel of
   Duba and Henry Lacembok. With John of Chlum was Mladenowitz, who did an
   important service by preserving Huss' letters and afterwards editing
   them with notes. Huss' correspondence, from this time on, deserves a
   place in the choice autobiographical literature of the Christian
   centuries. For pathos, simplicity of expression and devotion to Christ,
   the writings of the Middle Ages do not furnish anything superior.

   In a letter, written to friends in Bohemia on the eve of his departure,
   Huss expressed his expectation of being confronted at Constance by
   bishops, doctors, princes and canons regular, yea, by more foes than
   the Redeemer himself had to face. He prayed that, if his death would
   contribute aught to God's glory, he might be enabled to meet it without
   sinful fear. A second letter was not to be opened, except in case of
   his death. It was written to Martin, a disciple whom the writer says he
   had known from childhood. He binds Martin to fear God, to be careful
   how he listened to the confessions of women, and not to follow him in
   any frivolity he had been guilty of in other days, such as
   chess-playing. Persecution was about to do its worst because he had
   attacked the greed and incontinence of the clergy. He willed to Martin
   his gray cloak and bade him, in case of his death, give to the rector
   his white gown and to his faithful servant, George, a guinea.

   The route was through Nürnberg. Along the way Huss was met by throngs
   of curious people. He sat down in the inns with the local priests,
   talking over his case with them. At Nürnberg the magistrates and
   burghers invited him to meet them at an inn. Deeming it unnecessary to
   go out of its way to meet Sigismund, who was at Spires, the party
   turned its face directly to the lake of Constance. Arrived on its upper
   shore, they sent back most of their horses for sale, a wise measure, as
   it proved, in view of the thousands of animals that had to be cared for
   at Constance. [673]

   Arrived at Constance, Huss took lodgings with a "second widow of
   Sarepta," who had kept the bakery to the White Pigeon. The house is
   still shown. His coming was a great sensation, and he entered the town,
   riding through a large crowd. The day after, John of Chlum and Baron
   Lacembok called upon pope John XXIII., who promised that no violence
   should be done their friend, nay, even though he had killed the pope's
   own brother. He granted him leave to go about the city, but forbade him
   to attend high mass. Although he was under sentence of excommunication,
   Huss celebrated mass daily in his own lodgings. The cardinals were
   incensed that a man charged openly with heresy should have freedom, and
   whatever misgivings Huss had had of unfair dealing were to be quickly
   justified. Individual liberty had no rights before the bar of an
   ecclesiastical court in the 15th century when a heretic was under
   accusation. Before the month had passed, Huss' imprisonment began, a
   pretext being found in an alleged attempt to escape from the city
   concealed in a hay-wagon. [674] On November 28, the two bishops of
   Trent and Augsburg entered his lodgings with a requisition for him to
   appear before the cardinals. The house was surrounded by soldiers.
   Huss, after some hesitation, yielded and left, with the hostess
   standing at the stairs in tears. It was the beginning of the end.

   After a short audience with the cardinals, the prisoner was taken away
   by a guard of soldiers, and within a week he was securely immured in
   the dungeon of the Dominican convent. Preparations had been going on
   for several days to provide the place with locks, bolts and other
   strong furnishings.

   In this prison, Huss languished for three months. His cell was hard by
   the latrines. Fever and vomiting set in, and it seemed likely they
   would quickly do their dismal work. John XXIII. deserves some credit
   for having sent his physician, who applied clysters, as Huss himself
   wrote. To sickness was added the deprivation of books, including the
   Bible. For two months we have no letters from him. They begin again,
   with January, 1415, and give us a clear insight into the indignities to
   which he was exposed and the misery he suffered. These letters were
   sent by the gaoler.

   What was Sigismund doing? He had issued the letter of safe-conduct,
   Oct. 18. On the day before his arrival in Constance, Dec. 24th, John of
   Chlum posted up a notice on the cathedral, protesting that the king's
   agreement had been treated with defiance by the cardinals. Sigismund
   professed to be greatly incensed, and blustered, but this was the end
   of it. He was a time-serving prince who was easily persuaded to yield
   to the arguments of such ecclesiastical figures as D'Ailly, who
   insisted that little matters like Huss' heresy should not impede the
   reformation of the church, the council's first concern, and that error
   unreproved was error countenanced. [675] All good churchmen prayed his
   Majesty might not give way to the lies and subtleties of the
   Wycliffists. The king of Aragon wrote that Huss should be killed off at
   once, without having the formality of a hearing.

   During his imprisonment in the Black Friars' convent, Huss wrote for
   his gaoler, Robert, tracts on the Ten Commandments, the Lord's Prayer,
   Mortal Sin and Marriage. Of the 13 letters preserved from this time,
   the larger part were addressed to John of Chlum, his trusty friend.
   Some of the letters were written at midnight, and some on tattered
   scraps of paper. [676] In this correspondence four things are
   prominent: Huss' reliance upon the king and his word of honor, his
   consuming desire to be heard in open council, the expectation of
   possible death and his trust in God. He feared sentence would be passed
   before opportunity was given him to speak with the king. "If this is
   his honor, it is his own lookout," he wrote. [677]

   In the meantime the council had committed the matter of heresy to a
   commission, with D'Ailly at its head. It plied Huss with questions, and
   presented heretical articles taken from his writings. Stephen Paletz,
   his apostate friend, badgered him more than all the rest. His request
   for a "proctor and advocate" was denied. The thought of death was
   continually before him. But, as the Lord had delivered Jonah from the
   whale's belly, and Daniel from the lions, so, he believed, God would
   deliver him, if it were expedient.

   Upon John XXIII.'s flight, fears were felt that Huss might be delivered
   by his friends, and the keys of the prison were put into the hands of
   Sigismund. On March 24th the bishop of Constance had the prisoner
   chained and transferred by boat to his castle, Gottlieben. There he had
   freedom to walk about in his chains by day, but he was handcuffed and
   bound to the wall at night. The imprisonment at Gottlieben lasted
   seventy-three days, from March 24th-June 5th. If Huss wrote any letters
   during that time none have survived. It was a strange freak of history
   that the runaway pontiff, on being seized and brought back to
   Constance, was sent to Gottlieben to be fellow-prisoner with Huss, the
   one, the former head of Christendom, condemned for almost every known
   misdemeanor; the other, the preacher whose life was, by the testimony
   of all contemporaries, almost without a blemish. The criminal pope was
   to be released after a brief confinement and elevated to an exalted
   dignity; the other was to be contemned as a religious felon and burnt
   as an expiation to orthodox theology.

   At Gottlieben, Huss suffered from hemorrhage, headache and other
   infirmities, and at times was on the brink of starvation. A new
   commission, appointed April 6, with D'Ailly at its head, now took up
   seriously the heresy of Huss and Wyclif, whom the council coupled
   together. [678] Huss' friends had not forgotten him, and 250 Moravian
   and Bohemian nobles signed a remonstrance at Prag, May 13, which they
   sent to Sigismund, protesting against the treatment "the beloved master
   and Christian preacher" was receiving, and asked that he might be
   granted a public hearing and allowed to return home. Upon a public
   hearing Huss staked everything, and with such a hearing in view he had
   gone to Constance.

   In order to bring the prisoner within more convenient reach of the
   commission, he was transferred in the beginning of June to a third
   prison,--the Franciscan friary. From June 5-8 public hearings were had
   in the refectory, the room being crowded with cardinals, archbishops,
   bishops, theologians and persons of lesser degree. Cardinal D'Ailly was
   present and took the leading part as head of the commission. The action
   taken May 4th condemning 260 errors and heresies extracted from
   Wyclif's works was adapted to rob Huss of whatever hope of release he
   still indulged. Charges were made against him of holding that Christ is
   in the consecrated bread only as the soul is in the body, that Wyclif
   was a good Christian, that salvation was not dependent upon the pope
   and that no one could be excommunicated except by God Himself. He also
   had expressed the hope his soul might be where Wyclif's was. [679] When
   a copy of his book on the Church was shown, they shouted, "Burn it."
   Whenever Huss attempted to explain his positions, he was met with
   shouts, "Away with your sophistries. Say, Yes or No." The Englishman,
   John Stokes, who was present, declared that it seemed to him as if he
   saw Wyclif himself in bodily form sitting before him.

   On the morning of June 7th, Huss exclaimed that God and his conscience
   were on his side. But, Said D'Ailly, "we cannot go by your conscience
   when we have other evidence, and the evidence of Gerson himself against
   you, the most renowned doctor in Christendom." [680] D'Ailly and an
   Englishman attempted to show the logical connection of the doctrine of
   remanence with realism. When Huss replied that such reasoning was the
   logic of schoolboys, another Englishman had the courage to add, Huss is
   quite right: what have these quibbles to do with matters of faith?
   Sigismund advised Huss to submit, saying that he had told the
   commission he would not defend any heretic who was determined to stick
   to his heresy. He also declared that, so long as a single heretic
   remained, he was ready to light the fire himself with his own hand to
   burn him. He, however, promised that Huss should have a written list of
   charges the following day.

   That night, as Huss wrote, he suffered from toothache, vomiting,
   headache and the stone. On June 8th, 39 distinct articles were handed
   to him, 26 of which were drawn from his work on the Church. When he
   demurred at some of the statements, D'Ailly had the pertinent sections
   from the original writings read. When they came to the passage that no
   heretic should be put to death, the audience shouted in mockery. Huss
   went on to argue from the case of Saul, after his disobedience towards
   Agag, that kings in mortal sin have no right to authority. Sigismund
   happened to be at the moment at the window, talking to Frederick of
   Bavaria. The prelates, taking advantage of the avowal, cried out, "Tell
   the king Huss is now attacking him." The emperor turned and said, "John
   Huss, no one lives without sin." D'Ailly suggested that the prisoner,
   not satisfied with pulling down the spiritual fabric, was attempting to
   hurl down the monarchy likewise. In an attempt to break the force of
   his statement, Huss asked why they had deposed pope John. Sigismund
   replied that Baldassarre was real pope, but was deposed for his
   notorious crimes.

   The 39 articles included the heretical assertions that the Church is
   the totality of the elect, that a priest must continue preaching, even
   though he be under sentence of excommunication, and that whoso is in
   mortal sin cannot exercise authority. Huss expressed himself ready to
   revoke statements that might be proved untrue by Scripture and good
   arguments, but that he would not revoke any which were not so proved.
   When Sigismund remonstrated, Huss appealed to the judgment bar of God.
   At the close of the proceedings, D'Ailly declared that a compromise was
   out of the question. Huss must abjure. [681]

   As Huss passed out in the charge of the archbishop of Riga, John of
   Chlum had the courage to reach out his hand to him. The act reminds us
   of the friendly words Georg of Frundsberg spoke to Luther at Worms.
   Huss was most thankful, and a day or two afterward wrote how delightful
   it had been to see Lord John, who was not ashamed to hold out his hand
   to a poor, abject heretic, a prisoner in irons and the butt of all
   men's tongues. In addressing the assembly after Huss' departure,
   Sigismund argued against accepting submission from the prisoner who, if
   released, would go back to Bohemia and sow his errors broadcast. "When
   I was a boy," he said, "I remember the first sprouting of this sect,
   and see what it is today. We should make an end of the master one day,
   and when I return from my journey we will deal with his pupil. What's
   his name?" The reply was, Jerome. Yes, said the king, I mean Jerome.

   Huss, as he himself states, was pestered in prison by emissaries who
   sought to entrap him, or to "hold out baskets" for him to escape in.
   Some of the charges made against him he ascribes to false witnesses.
   But many of the charges were not false, and it is difficult to
   understand how he could expect to free himself by a public statement,
   in view of the solemn condemnation passed upon the doctrines of Wyclif.
   He was convinced that none of the articles brought against him were
   contrary to the Gospel of Christ, but canon law ruled at councils, not
   Scripture. A doctor told him that if the council should affirm he had
   only one eye, he ought to accept the verdict. Huss replied if the whole
   world were to tell him so, he would not say so and offend his
   conscience, and he appealed to the case of Eleazar in the Book of the
   Maccabees, who would not make a lying confession. [682] But he was
   setting his house in order. He wrote affecting messages to his people
   in Bohemia and to John of Chlum. He urged the Bohemians to hear only
   priests of good report, and especially those who were earnest students
   of Holy Writ. Martin he adjured to read the Bible diligently,
   especially the New Testament.

   On June 15th, the council took the far-reaching action forbidding the
   giving of the cup to laymen. This action Huss condemned as wickedness
   and madness, on the ground that it was a virtual condemnation of
   Christ's example and command. To Hawlik, who had charge of the
   Bethlehem chapel, he wrote, urging him not to withhold the cup from the
   laity. [683] He saw indisputable proof that the council was fallible.
   One day it kissed the feet of John, as a paragon of virtue, and called
   him "most holy," and the next it condemned him as "a shameful homicide,
   a sodomite, a simoniac and a heretic." He quoted the proverb, common
   among the Swiss, that a generation would not suffice to cleanse
   Constance from the sins the body had committed in that city.

   The darkness deepened around the prisoner. On June 24th, by the
   council's orders, his writings were to be burnt, even those written in
   Czech which, almost in a tone of irony, as he wrote, the councillors
   had not seen and could not read. He bade his friends not be terrified,
   for Jeremiah's books, which the prophet had written at the Lord's
   direction, were burnt.

   His affectionate interest in the people of "his glorious country" and
   in the university on the Moldau, and his feeling of gratitude to the
   friends who had supported him continued unabated. A dreadful death was
   awaiting him, but he recalled the sufferings of Apostles and the
   martyrs, and especially the agonies endured by Christ, and he believed
   he would be purged of his sins through the flames. D'Ailly had replied
   to him on one occasion by peremptorily saying he should obey the
   decision of 50 doctors of the Church and retract without asking any
   questions. "A wonderful piece of information," he wrote, "As if the
   virgin, St. Catherine, ought to have renounced the truth and her faith
   in the Lord because 50 philosophers opposed her." [684] In one of his
   last letters, written to his alma mater of Prag, he declared he had not
   recanted a single article.

   On the first day of July, he was approached by the archbishops of Riga
   and Ragusa and 6 other prelates, who still had a hope of drawing from
   him a recantation. A written declaration made by Huss in reply showed
   the hope vain. [685] Another effort was made July 5th, Cardinals
   D'Ailly and Zabarella and bishop Hallum of Salisbury being of the party
   of visiting prelates. Huss closed the discussion by declaring that he
   would rather be burnt a thousand times than abjure, for by abjuring he
   said he would offend those whom he had taught. [686]

   Still another deputation approached him, his three friends John of
   Chlum, Wenzel of Duba and Lacembok, and four bishops. They were sent by
   Sigismund. As a layman, John of Chlum did not venture to give Huss
   advice, but bade him, if he felt sure of his cause, rather than to be
   against God, to stand fast, even to death. One of the bishops asked
   whether he presumed to be wiser than the whole council. No, was the
   reply, but to retract he must be persuaded of his errors out of the
   Scriptures. "An obstinate heretic!" exclaimed the bishops. This was the
   final interview in private. The much-desired opportunity was at hand
   for him to stand before the council as a body, and it was his last day
   on earth.

   After seven months of dismal imprisonment and deepening disappointment,
   on Saturday, July 6th, Huss was conducted to the cathedral. It was 6 A.
   M., and he was kept waiting outside the doors until the celebration of
   mass was completed. He was then admitted to the sacred edifice, but not
   to make a defence, as he had come to Constance hoping to do. He was to
   listen to sentence pronounced upon him as an ecclesiastical outcast and
   criminal. He was placed in the middle of the church on a high stool,
   set there specially for him. [687] The bishop of Lodi preached from
   Rom. 6:6, "that the body of sin may be destroyed." The extermination of
   heretics was represented as one of the works most pleasing to God, and
   the preacher used the time-worn illustrations from the rotten piece of
   flesh, the little spark which is in danger of turning into a great
   flame and the creeping cancer. The more virulent the poison the swifter
   should be the application of the cauterizing iron. In the style of
   Bossuet in a later age, before Louis XIV., he pronounced upon Sigismund
   the eulogy that his name would be coupled with song and triumph for all
   time for his efforts to uproot schism and destroy heresy.

   The commission, which included Patrick, bishop of Cork, appointed to
   pronounce the sentence, then ascended the pulpit. All expressions of
   feeling with foot or hand, all vociferation or attempt to start
   disputation were solemnly forbidden on pain of excommunication. 30
   articles were then read, which were pronounced as heretical, seditious
   and offensive to pious ears. The sentence coupled in closest relation
   Wyclif and Huss. [688] The first of the articles charged the prisoner
   with holding that the Church is the totality of the predestinate, and
   the last that no civil lord or prelate may exercise authority who is in
   mortal sin. Huss begged leave to speak, but was hushed up.

   The sentence ran that "the holy council, having God only before its
   eye, condemns John Huss to have been and to be a true, real and open
   heretic, the disciple not of Christ but of John Wyclif, one who in the
   University of Prag and before the clergy and people declared Wyclif to
   be a Catholic and an evangelical doctor--vir catholicus et doctor
   evangelicus." It ordered him degraded from the sacerdotal order, and,
   not wishing to exceed the powers committed unto the Church, it
   relinquished him to the secular authority.

   Not a dissenting voice was lifted against the sentence. Even John
   Gerson voted for it. One incident has left its impress upon history,
   although it is not vouched for by a contemporary. It is said that, when
   Huss began to speak, he looked at Sigismund, reminding him of the
   safe-conduct. The king who sat in state and crowned, turned red, but
   did not speak.

   The order of degradation was carried out by six bishops, who disrobed
   the condemned man of his vestments and destroyed his tonsure. They then
   put on his head a cap covered over with pictures of the devil and
   inscribed with the word, heresiarch, and committed his soul to the
   devil. With upturned eyes, Huss exclaimed, "and I commit myself to the
   most gracious Lord Jesus."

   The old motto that the Church does not want blood--ecclesia non sitit
   sanguinem -- was in appearance observed, but the authorities knew
   perfectly well what was to be the last scene when they turned Huss over
   to Sigismund. "Go, take him and do to him as a heretic" were the words
   with which the king remanded the prisoner to the charge of Louis, the
   Count Palatine. A guard of a thousand armed men was at hand. The
   streets were thronged with people. As Huss passed on, he saw the flames
   on the public square which were consuming his books. For fear of the
   bridge's breaking down, the greater part of the crowd was not allowed
   to cross over to the place of execution, called the Devil's Place.
   Huss' step had been firm, but now, with tears in his eyes, he knelt
   down and prayed. The paper cap falling from his head, the crowd shouted
   that it should be put on, wrong side front.

   It was midday. The prisoner's hands were fastened behind his back, and
   big neck bound to the stake by a chain. On the same spot sometime
   before, so the chronicler notes, a cardinal's worn-out mule had been
   buried. The straw and wood were heaped up around Huss' body to the
   chin, and rosin sprinkled upon them. The offer of life was renewed if
   he would recant. He refused and said, "I shall die with joy to-day in
   the faith of the gospel which I have preached." When Richental, who was
   standing by, suggested a confessor, he replied, "There is no need of
   one. I have no mortal sin." At the call of bystanders, they turned his
   face away from the East, and as the flames arose, he sang twice,
   Christ, thou Son of the living God, have mercy upon me. The wind blew
   the fire into the martyr's face, and his voice was hushed. He died,
   praying and singing. To remove, if possible, all chance of preserving
   relics from the scene, Huss' clothes and shoes were thrown into the
   merciless flames. The ashes were gathered up and cast into the Rhine.

   While this scene was being enacted, the council was going on with the
   transaction of business as if the burning without the gates were only a
   common event. Three weeks later, it announced that it had done nothing
   more pleasing to God than to punish the Bohemian heretic. For this act
   it has been chiefly remembered by after generations.

   Not one of the members of the Council of Constance, after its
   adjournment, so far as we know, uttered a word of protest against the
   sentence. No pope or oecumenical synod since has made any apology for
   it. Nor has any modern Catholic historian gone further than to indicate
   that in essential theological doctrines Huss was no heretic, though his
   sentence was strictly in accord with the principles of the canon law.
   So long as the dogmas of an infallible Church organization and an
   infallible pope continue to be strictly held, no apology can be
   expected. It is of the nature of Protestant Christianity to confess
   wrongs and, as far as is possible, make reparation for them. When the
   Massachusetts court discovered that it had erred in the case of the
   Salem witchcraft in 1692, it made full confession, and offered
   reparation to the surviving descendants; and Judge Sewall, one of the
   leaders in the prosecution, made a moving public apology for the
   mistake he had committed. The same court recalled the action against
   Roger Williams. In 1903, the Protestants of France reared a monument at
   Geneva in expiation of Calvin's part in passing sentence upon Servetus.
   Luther, in his Address to the German Nobility, called upon the Roman
   Church to confess it had done wrong in burning Huss. That innocent
   man's blood still cries from the ground.

   Huss died for his advocacy of Wycliffism. The sentence passed by the
   council coupled the two names together. [689] The 25th of the 30
   Articles condemned him for taking offence at the reprobation of the 45
   articles, ascribed to Wyclif. How much this article was intended to
   cover cannot be said. It is certain that Huss did not formally deny the
   doctrine of transubstantiation, although he was charged with that
   heresy. Nor was he distinctly condemned for urging the distribution of
   the cup to the laity, which he advocated after the council had
   positively forbidden it. His only offence was his definition of the
   Church and his denial of the infallibility of the papacy and its
   necessity for the being of the Church. These charges constitute the
   content of all the 30 articles except the 25th. Luther said brusquely
   but truly, that Huss committed no more atrocious sin than to declare
   that a Roman pontiff of impious life is not the head of the Church
   catholic. [690]

   John Huss struck at the foundations of the hierarchical system. He
   interpreted our Lord's words to Peter in a way that was fatal to the
   papal theory of Leo, Hildebrand and Innocent III. [691] His conception
   of the Church, which he drew from Wyclif, contains the kernel of an
   entirely new system of religious authority. He made the Scriptures the
   final source of appeal, and exalted the authority of the conscience
   above pope, council and canon law as an interpreter of truth. He
   carried out these views in practice by continuing to preach in spite of
   repeated sentences of excommunication, and attacking the pope's right
   to call a crusade. If the Church be the company of the elect, as Huss
   maintained, then God rules in His people and they are sovereign. With
   such assertions, the teachings of Thomas Aquinas were set aside.

   The enlightened group of men who shared the spirit of Gerson and
   D'Ailly did not comprehend Wycliffism, for Wycliffism was a revolt
   against an alleged divine institution, the visible Church. Gerson
   denied that the appeal to conscience was an excuse for refusing to
   submit to ecclesiastical authority. Faith, with him, was agreement with
   the Church's system. The chancellor not only voted for Huss'
   condemnation, but declared he had busily worked to bring the sentence
   about. Nineteen articles he drew from Huss' work on the Church, he
   pronounced "notoriously heretical." However, at a later time, in a huff
   over the leniency shown to Jean Petit, he stated that if Huss had been
   given an advocate, he would never have been convicted. [692]

   In starting out for Constance, Huss knew well the punishment appointed
   for heretics. The amazing thing is that he should ever have thought it
   possible to clear himself by a public address before the council. In
   view of the procedure of the Inquisition, the council showed him
   unheard-of consideration in allowing him to appear in the cathedral.
   This was done out of regard for Sigismund, who was on the eve of his
   journey to Spain to induce Benedict of Luna to abdicate. [693]

   As for the safe-conduct--salvo-conductus -- issued by Sigismund, all
   that can be said is that a king did not keep his word. He was more
   concerned to be regarded as the patron of a great council than to
   protect a Bohemian preacher, his future subject. Writing with reference
   to the solemn pledge, Huss said, "Christ deceives no man by a
   safe-conduct. What he pledges he fulfils. Sigismund has acted
   deceitfully throughout." [694] The plea, often made, that the king had
   no intention of giving Huss an unconditional pledge of protection, is
   in the face of the documentary evidence. In September, 1415, the
   Council of Constance took formal notice of the criticisms floating
   about that in Huss' execution a solemn promise had been broken, and
   announced that no brief of safe-conduct in the case of a heretic is
   binding. No pledge is to be observed which is prejudicial to the
   Catholic faith and ecclesiastical jurisdiction. [695]

   The safe-conduct was in the ordinary form, addressed to all the princes
   and subjects of the empire, ecclesiastical and secular, and informing
   them that Huss should be allowed to pass, remain and return without
   impediment. Jerome, according to the sentence passed upon him by the
   council, declared that the safe-conduct had been grossly violated, and
   when, in 1433, the legates of the Council of Basel attempted to throw
   the responsibility for Huss' condemnation on false witnesses, so
   called, Rokyzana asked how the Council of Constance could have been
   moved by the Holy Ghost if it were controlled by perjurers, and showed
   that the violation of the safe-conduct had not been forgotten. When the
   Bohemian deputies a year earlier had come to Basel, they demanded the
   most carefully prepared briefs of safe-conduct from the Council of
   Basel, the cities of Eger and Basel and from Sigismund and others.
   Frederick of Brandenburg and John of Bavaria agreed to furnish troops
   to protect the Hussites on their way to Basel, at Basel, and on their
   journey home. A hundred and six years later, Luther profited by Huss'
   misfortune when he recalled Sigismund's perfidy, perfidy which the
   papal system of the 16th century would have repeated, had Charles V.
   given his consent. [696]

   In a real sense, Huss was the precursor of the Reformation. It is true,
   the prophecy was wrongly ascribed to him, "To-day you roast a
   goose--Huss--but a hundred years from now a swan will arise out of my
   ashes which you shall not roast." Unknown to contemporary writers, it
   probably originated after Luther had fairly entered upon his work. But
   he struck a hard blow at hierarchical assumption before Luther raised
   his stronger arm. Luther was moved by Huss' case, and at Leipzig,
   forced to the wall by Eck's thrusts, the Wittenberg monk made the open
   avowal that oecumenical councils also may err, as was done in putting
   Huss to death at Constance. Years before, at Erfurt, he had taken up a
   volume of the Bohemian sermons, and was amazed that a man who preached
   so evangelically should have been condemned to the stake. But for fear
   of the taint of heresy, he quickly put it down. [697] The accredited
   view in Luther's time was given by Dobneck in answer to Luther's good
   opinion, when he said that Huss was worse than a Turk, Jew, Tartar and
   Sodomite. In his edition of Huss' letters, printed 1537, Luther praised
   Huss' patience and humility under every indignity and his courage
   before an imposing assembly as a lamb in the midst of wolves and lions.
   If such a man, he wrote, "is to be regarded as a heretic, then no
   person under the sun can be looked upon as a true Christian."

   A cantionale, dating from 1572, and preserved in the Prag library,
   contains a hymn to Huss' memory and three medallions which well set
   forth the relation in which Wyclif and Huss stand to the Reformation.
   The first represents Wyclif striking sparks from a stone. Below it is
   Huss, kindling a fire from the sparks. In the third medallion, Luther
   is holding aloft the flaming torch. his is the historic succession,
   although it is true Luther began his career as a Reformer before he was
   influenced by Huss, and continued his work, knowing little of Wyclif.

   To the cause of religious toleration, and without intending it, John
   Huss made a more effectual contribution by his death than could have
   been made by many philosophical treatises, even as the deaths of
   Blandina and other martyrs of the early Church, who were slaves, did
   more towards the reduction of the evils of slavery than all the
   sentences of Pagan philosophers. Quite like his English teacher, he
   affirmed the sovereign rights of the truth. It was his habit, so he
   stated, to conform his views to the truth, whatever the truth might be.
   If any one, he said, "can instruct me by the sacred Scriptures or by
   good reasoning, I am willing to follow him. From the outset of my
   studies, I have made it a rule to joyfully and humbly recede from a
   former opinion when in any matter I perceive a more rational opinion."

   [690] Note appended to Huss' writings, ed. 1537. See Huss' Opp.,
   Prelim. Statement, I. 4. It did not require the study of the modem
   historian to affirm the view taken above. John Foxe, in his Book of
   Martyrs, presented it clearly when he said, "By the life, acts and
   letters of Huss, it is plain that he was condemned not for any error of
   doctrine, for he neither denied their popish transubstantiation,
   neither spake against the authority of the church of Rome, if it were
   well governed, nor yet against the seven sacraments, but said mass
   himself and in almost all their popish opinions was a papist with them,
   but only through evil will was he accused because he spoke against the
   pomp, pride and avarice and other wicked enormities of the pope,
   cardinals and prelates of the church, etc.

   [691] Gerson declared that among the causes for which Huss was
   condemned was that he had affirmed that the Church could be ruled by
   priests dispersed throughout the world in the absence of one head an
   well as with one head. Schwab, p. 588.

   universalibus, which Huss translated, 1398. See Loserth, p. 253.

   § 46. Jerome of Prag.

   A year after Huss' martyrdom, on May 30, 1416, his friend Jerome of
   Prag was condemned by the council and also suffered at the stake. He
   shared Huss' enthusiasm for Wyclif, was perhaps his equal in
   scholarship, but not in steadfast constancy. Huss' life was spent in
   Prag and its vicinity. Jerome travelled in Western Europe and was in
   Prag only occasionally. Huss left quite a body of writings, Jerome,
   none.

   Born of a good family at Prag, Jerome studied in his native city, and
   later at Oxford and Paris. At Oxford he became a student and admirer of
   Wyclif's writings, two of which, the Trialogus and the Dialogus, he
   carried with him back to Bohemia not later than 1402. In Prag, he
   defended the English doctor as a holy man "whose doctrines were more
   worthy of acceptance than Augustine himself," stood with Huss in the
   contest over the rights of the Bohemian nation, and joined him in
   attacking the papal indulgences, 1412.

   Soon after arriving in Constance, Huss wrote to John of Chlum not to
   allow Jerome on any account to go to join him. In spite of this
   warning, Jerome set out and reached Constance April 4th, 1415, but
   urged by friends he quit the city. He was seized at Hirschau, April 15,
   and taken back in chains. There is every reason for supposing he and
   Huss did not see one another, although Huss mentions him in a letter
   within a week before his death, [699] expressing the hope that he would
   die holy and blameless and be of a braver spirit in meeting pain than
   he was. Huss had misjudged himself. In the hour of grave crisis he
   proved constant and heroic, while his friend gave way.

   On Sept. 11, 1415, Jerome solemnly renounced his admiration for Wyclif
   and professed accord with the Roman church and the Apostolic see and,
   twelve days later, solemnly repeated his abjuration in a formula
   prepared by the council. [700]

   Release from prison did not follow. It was the council's intention that
   Jerome should sound forth his abjuration as loudly as possible in
   Bohemia, and write to Wenzel, the university and the Bohemian nobles;
   but he disappointed his judges. Following Gerson's lead, the council
   again put the recusant heretic on trial. The sittings took place in the
   cathedral, May 23 and 26, 1416. The charge of denying
   transubstantiation Jerome repudiated, but he confessed to having done
   ill in pledging himself to abandon the writings and teachings of that
   good man John Wyclif, and Huss. Great injury had been done to Huss, who
   had come to the council with assurance of safe-conduct. Even Judas or a
   Saracen ought under such circumstances to be free to come and go and to
   speak his mind freely.

   On May 30, Jerome was again led into the cathedral. The bishop of Lodi
   ascended the pulpit and preached a sermon, calling upon the council to
   punish the prisoner, and counselling that against other such heretics,
   if there should be any, any witnesses whatever should be allowed to
   testify,--ruffians, thieves and harlots. The sermon being over, Jerome
   mounted a bench--bancum ascendens -- and made a defence whose eloquence
   is attested by Poggio and others who were present. Thereupon, the, holy
   synod "pronounced him a follower of Wyclif and Huss, and adjudged him
   to be cast off as a rotten and withered branch--palmitem putridum et
   aridum. [701]

   Jerome went out from the cathedral wearing a cheerful countenance. A
   paper cap was put on his head, painted over with red devils. No
   sentence of deposition was necessary or ceremony of disrobing, for the
   condemned man was merely a laic. [702] He died on the spot where Huss
   suffered. As the wood was being piled around him, he sang the Easter
   hymn, salva festa dies, Hail, festal day. The flames were slow in
   putting an end to his miseries as compared with Huss. His ashes were
   thrown into the Rhine. And many learned people wept, the chronicler
   Richental says, that he had to die, for he was almost more learned than
   Huss. After his death, the council joined his name with the names of
   Wyclif and Huss as leaders of heresy.

   Poggio Bracciolini's description of Jerome's address in the cathedral
   runs thus:--

   It was wonderful to see with what words, with what eloquence, with what
   arguments, with what countenance and with what composure, Jerome
   replied to his adversaries, and how fairly he put his case .... He
   advanced nothing unworthy of a good man, as though he felt
   confident--as he also publicly asserted--that no just reason could be
   found for his death .... Many persons he touched with humor, many with
   satire, many very often he caused to laugh in spite of the sad affair,
   jesting at their reproaches .... He took them back to Socrates,
   unjustly condemned by his fellow-citizens. Then be mentioned the
   captivity of Plato, the flight of Anaxagoras, the torture of Zeno and
   the unjust condemnation of many other Pagans .... Thence he passed to
   the Hebrew examples, first instancing Moses, the liberator of his
   people, Joseph, sold by his brethren, Isaiah, Daniel, Susannah ....
   Afterwards, coming down to John the Baptist and then to the Saviour, he
   showed how, in each case, they were condemned by false witnesses and
   false judges .... Then proceeding to praise John Huss, who had been
   condemned to be burnt, he called him a good man, just and holy,
   unworthy of such a death, saying that he himself was prepared to go to
   any punishment whatsoever .... He said that Huss had never held
   opinions hostile to the Church of God, but only against the abuses of
   the clergy, against the pride, the arrogance and the pomp of prelates
   .... He displayed the greatest cleverness,--for, when his speech was
   often interrupted with various disturbances, he left no one unscathed
   but turned trenchantly upon his accusers and forced them to blush, or
   be still .... For 340 days he lay in the bottom of a foul, dark tower.
   He himself did not complain at the harshness of this treatment, but
   expressed his wonder that such inhumanity could be shown him. In the
   dungeon, he said, he had not only no facilities for reading, but none
   for seeing .... He stood there fearless and unterrified, not alone
   despising death but seeking it, so that you would have said he was
   another Cato. O man, worthy of the everlasting memory of men! I praise
   not that which he advanced, if anything contrary to the institutions of
   the Church; but I admire his learning, his eloquence, his
   persuasiveness of speech, his adroitness in reply .... Persevering in
   his errors, he went to his fate with joyful and willing countenance,
   for he feared not the fire nor any kind of torture or death .... When
   the executioners wished to start the fire behind his back that he might
   not see it, he said, 'Come here and light the fire in front of me. If I
   had been afraid of it, I should never have come to this place.' In this
   way a man worthy, except in respect of faith, was burnt .... Not Mutius
   himself suffered his arm to burn with such high courage as did this man
   his whole body. Nor did Socrates drink the poison so willingly as be
   accepted the flames. [703]

   Aeneas Sylvius, afterwards Pius II., bore similar testimony to the
   cheerfulness which Huss and Jerome displayed in the face of death, and
   said that they went to the stake as to a feast and suffered death with
   more courage than any philosopher. [704]

   § 47. The Hussites.

   The news of Huss' execution stirred the Bohemian nation to its depths.
   Huss was looked upon as a national hero and a martyr. The revolt, which
   followed, threatened the very existence of the papal rule in Bohemia.
   No other dissenting movement of the Middle Ages assumed such formidable
   proportions. The Hussites, the name given to the adherents of the new
   body, soon divided into two organized parties, the Taborites and the
   Calixtines or Utraquists. They agreed in demanding the distribution of
   the cup to the laity. A third body, the Unitas Fratrum, or Bohemian
   Brethren, originated in the middle of the 15th century, forty years
   after Huss' death. When it became known that Huss had perished in the
   flames, the populace of Prag stoned the houses of the priests
   unfriendly to the martyr; and the archbishop himself was attacked in
   his palace, and with difficulty eluded the popular rage by flight. King
   Wenzel at first seemed about to favor the popular party.

   The Council of Constance, true to itself, addressed a document to the
   bishop and clergy of Prag, designating Wyclif, Huss and Jerome as most
   unrighteous, dangerous and shameful men, [705] and calling upon the
   Prag officials to put down those who were sowing their doctrines.

   The high regard in which Huss was held found splendid expression at the
   Bohemian diet, Sept. 2, 1415, when 452 nobles signed an indignant
   remonstrance to the council for its treatment of their "most beloved
   brother," whom they pronounced to be a righteous and catholic man,
   known in Bohemia for many years by his exemplary life and honest
   preaching of the law of the Gospel. They concluded the document by
   announcing their intention to defend, even to the effusion of blood,
   the law of Christ and his devoted preachers. [706] Three days later,
   the nobles formed a league which was to remain in force for six years,
   in which they bound themselves to defend the free preaching of the
   Gospel on their estates, and to recognize the authority of prelates
   only so far as they acted according to the Scriptures.

   To this manifesto the council, Feb. 20, 1416, replied by citing the
   signers to appear before it within 50 days, on pain of being declared
   contumacious.

   Huss' memory also had honor at the hands of the university, which, on
   May 23, 1416, sent forth a communication addressed to all lands,
   eulogizing him as in all things a master whose life was without an
   equal. [707] In omnibus Magister vitae sine pari.

   Upon the dissolution of the council, Martin V., who, as a member of the
   curia, had excommunicated Huss, did not allow the measures to root out
   Hussitism drag. In his bull Inter cunctos, [708] Feb. 22, 1418, he
   ordered all of both sexes punished as heretics who maintained "the
   pestilential doctrine of the heresiarchs, John Wyclif, John Huss and
   Jerome of Prag." Wenzel announced his purpose to obey the council, but
   many of his councillors left the court, including the statesman,
   Nicolas of Pistna, and the military leader, the one-eyed John Zizka.
   The popular excitement ran so high that, during a Hussite procession,
   the crowd rushed into the council-house and threw out of the window
   seven of the councillors who had dared to insult the procession.

   Affairs entered a new stage with Wenzel's death, 1419. With
   considerable unanimity the Bohemian nobles acceded to his successor
   Sigismund's demand that the cup be withheld from the laity, but the
   nation at large did not acquiesce, and civil war followed. Convents and
   churches were sacked. Sigismund could not make himself master of his
   kingdom, and an event occurred during his visit in Breslau which
   deepened the feeling against him. A merchant, John Krasa, asserting on
   the street the innocence of Huss, was dragged at a horse's tail to the
   stake and burnt. Hussite preachers inveighed against Sigismund, calling
   him the dragon of the Apocalypse.

   Martin V. now summoned Europe to a crusade against Bohemia, offering
   the usual indulgences, as Innocent III. had done two centuries before,
   when he summoned a crusade against the Cathari in Southern France. In
   obedience to the papal mandate, 150,000 men gathered from all parts of
   Europe. All the horrors of war were perpetrated, and whole provinces
   desolated. Five times the holy crusaders entered the land of Huss, and
   five times they were beaten back. In 1424 the Hussites lost their
   bravest military leader, John Zizka, but in 1427, under his successor,
   Procopius Rasa, called the Great, the most influential priest of Prag,
   they took the offensive and invaded Germany.

   While they were winning victories over the foreign intruders, the
   Hussites were divided among themselves in regard to the extent to which
   the religious reformation should be carried. The radical party, called
   the Taborites, from the steep hill Tabor, 60 miles south of Prag, on
   which they built a city, rejected transubstantiation, the worship of
   saints, prayers for the dead, indulgences and priestly confession and
   renounced oaths, dances and other amusements. They admitted laymen,
   including women, to the office of preaching, and used the national
   tongue in all parts of the public service. Zizka, their first leader,
   held the sword in the spirit of one of the Judges. After his death, the
   stricter wing of the Taborites received the name of the Orphans.

   The moderate party was called now Pragers, from the chief seat of their
   influence, now Calixtines,--from the word calix or cup,--or Utraquists
   from the expression sub utraque specie, "under both forms," from their
   insisting upon the administration of the cup to the laity. The
   University of Prag took sides with the Calixtines and, in 1420, the
   four so-called Prag articles were adopted. This compact demanded the
   free preaching of the Gospel, the distribution of the cup to the laity,
   the execution of punishment for mortal sins by the civil court, and the
   return of the clergy to the practice of Apostolic poverty. The
   Calixtines confined the use of Czech at the church service to the
   Scripture readings. [709]

   After the disastrous rout of the Catholic army, led by Cardinal
   Cesarini at Tauss, Aug. 14, 1431, the history of the Bohemian movement
   passed into a third stage, marked by the negotiations begun by the
   Council of Basel and the almost complete annihilation of the Taborite
   party. It was a new spectacle for an oecumenical council to treat with
   heretics as with a party having rights. Unqualified submission was the
   demand which the Church had heretofore made. On Oct. 15, 1431, the
   council invited the Bohemians to a conference and promised delegates
   safe-conduct. This promise assured them that neither guile nor deceit
   would be resorted to on any ground whatsoever, whether it be of
   authority or the privileges of canon law or of the decisions of the
   Councils of Constance and Siena or any other council. [710] Three
   hundred delegates appointed by the Bohemian diet appeared in Basel. On
   the way, at Eger, and in the presence of the landgrave of Brandenburg
   and John, duke of Bavaria, they laid down their own terms, which were
   sent ahead and accepted by the council. [711] These terms, embodied in
   thirteen articles, dealt with the method of carrying on the
   negotiations, the cessation of the interdict during the sojourn of the
   delegates in the Swiss city and the privilege of practising their own
   religious rites. The leaders of the Bohemian delegation were John
   Rokyzana of the Utraquist party and the Taborite, Procopius. Rokyzana
   was the pastor of the Teyn Church in Prag.

   The council recognized the austere principles of the Hussites by
   calling upon the Basel authorities to prohibit all dancing and gambling
   and the appearance of loose women on the streets. On their arrival,
   Jan. 4, 1433, the Bohemians were assigned to four public taverns, and a
   large supply of wine and provisions placed at their disposal.
   Delegations from the council and from the city bade them formal
   welcome. They followed their own rituals, the Taborites arousing most
   curiosity by the omission of all Latin from the services and discarding
   altar and priestly vestments.

   On the floor of the council, the Bohemians coupled praise with the
   names of Wyclif and Huss, and would tolerate no references to
   themselves as heretics. The discussions were prolonged to a wearisome
   length, some of their number occupying as much as two or three days in
   their addresses. Among the chief speakers was the Englishman, Peter
   Payne, whose address consumed three days. The final agreement of four
   articles, known as the Campactata, was ratified by deputies of the
   council and of the three Bohemian parties giving one another the hand.
   The main article granted the use of the cup to the laity, where it was
   asked, but on condition that the doctrine be inculcated that the whole
   Christ is contained in each of the elements. The use of the cup was
   affirmed to be wholesome to those partaking worthily. [712] The
   Compacts were ratified by the Bohemian diet of Iglau, July 5, 1436. All
   ecclesiastical censures were lifted from Bohemia and its people. The
   abbot of Bonnival, addressing the king of Castile upon the progress of
   the Council of Basel, declared that the Bohemians at the start were
   like ferocious lions and greedy wolves, but through the mercy of Christ
   and after much discussion had been turned into the meekest lambs and
   accepted the four articles. [713]

   Although technically the question was settled, the Taborites were not
   satisfied. The Utraquists approached closer to the Catholics.
   Hostilities broke out between them, and after a wholesale massacre in
   Prag, involving, it is said, 22,000 victims, the two parties joined in
   open war. The Taborites were defeated in the battle at Lipan, May 30,
   1434, and Procopius slain. This distinguished man had travelled
   extensively, going as far as Jerusalem before receiving priestly
   orders. He was a brilliant leader, and won many successes in Austria,
   Moravia and Hungary. The power of the Taborites was gone, and in 1452
   they lost Mt. Tabor, their chief stronghold.

   The emperor now entered upon possession of his Bohemian kingdom and
   granted full recognition to the Utraquist priests, promising to give
   his sanction to the elections of bishops made by the popular will and
   to secure their ratification by the pope. Rokyzana was elected
   archbishop of Prag by the Bohemian diet of 1435. Sigismund died soon
   after, 1437, and the archbishop never received papal recognition,
   although he administered the affairs of the diocese until his death,
   1471.

   Albert of Austria, son-in-law of Sigismund and an uncompromising
   Catholic, succeeded to the throne. In 1457 George Podiebrad, a powerful
   noble, was crowned by Catholic bishops, and remained king of Bohemia
   till 1471. He was a consistent supporter of the national party which
   held to the Compactata. The papal authorities, refusing to recognize
   Rokyzana, despatched emissaries to subdue the heretics by the measures
   of preaching and miracles. The most noted among them were Fra Giacomo
   and John of Capistrano. John, whose miraculous agency equalled his
   eloquence, succumbed to a fever after the battle of Belgrade.

   In 1462 the Compacts were declared void by Pius II., who threatened
   with excommunication all priests administering the cup to the laity.
   George Podiebrad resisted the papal bull. Four years later, a papal
   decree sought to deprive that "son of perdition" of his royal dignity,
   and summoned the Hungarian king, Matthias Corvinus, to take his crown.
   [714] Matthias accepted the responsibility, the cross and invaded
   Moravia. The war was still in progress when Podiebrad died. By the
   peace of Kuttenberg 1485 and an agreement made in 1512, the Utraquists
   preserved their right to exist at the side of their Catholic neighbors.
   Thus they continued till 1629, when the right of communion in both
   kinds was withdrawn by Ferdinand II. of Austria, whose hard and bloody
   hand put an end to all open dissent in Bohemia. [715]

   The third outgrowth from the Hussite stock, the Unitas Fratrum,
   commonly called the Bohemian Brethren, has had an honorable and a
   longer history than the Taborites and Calixtines. This body still has
   existence in the Moravians, whose missionary labors, with Herrnhut as a
   centre, have stirred all Protestant Christendom. Its beginnings are
   uncertain. It appears distinctly for the first time in 1457, and
   continued to grow till the time of the Reformation. Its synod of 1467
   was attended by 60 Brethren. The members in Prag were subjected to
   persecution, and George Podiebrad gave them permission to settle on the
   estate, Lititz, in the village corporation of Kunwald. [716] Martin,
   priest at Königgraetz, with a part of his flock affiliated himself with
   them, and other congregations were soon formed. They were a distinct
   type, worshipping by themselves, and did not take the sacraments from
   the Catholic priests. They rejected oaths, war and military service and
   resorted, apparently from the beginning, to the lot. They also rejected
   the doctrine of purgatory and all services of priests of unworthy life.

   The exact relation which this Hussite body bore to the Taborites and to
   the Austrian Waldenses is a matter which has called forth much learned
   discussion, and is still involved in uncertainty. But there seems to be
   no doubt that the Bohemian Brethren were moved by the spirit of Huss,
   and also that in their earliest period they came into contact with the
   Waldenses. Pressing up from Italy, the followers of Peter Valdez had
   penetrated into Bohemia in the later part of the 14th century, and had
   Frederick Reiser as their leader. [717] This Apostolic man was present
   at the Council of Basel, 1435, and styled himself, "the bishop of the
   faithful in the Romish church, who reject the donation of Constantine."
   With Anna Weiler, he suffered at the stake in Strassburg, 1458. One of
   the earliest names associated with the Bohemian Brethren is the name of
   Peter Chelcicky, a marked religious personage in his day in Bohemia. We
   know he was a man of authority among them, but little more. [718]

   Believing that the papal priesthood had been corrupt since
   Constantine's donation to Sylvester, the Brethren, at the synod of
   1467, chose Michael, pastor of Senftenburg, "presbyter and bishop," and
   sent him to the Waldensian bishop Stephen for sanction or consecration.
   [719] It seems probable that Stephen had received orders at Basel from
   bishops in the regular succession. On his return, Michael consecrated
   Matthias of Kunwald, while he himself, for a time and for a reason not
   known, was not officially recognized. The synod had resorted to the lot
   and placed the words "he is" on 3 out of 12 ballots, 9 being left
   blank. Matthias chose one of he printed ballots. [720] Matthias, in
   turn, ordained Thomas and Elias bishops, men who had drawn the other
   two printed ballots.

   By 1500, the Bohemian Brethren numbered 200,000 scattered in 300 or 400
   congregations in Bohemia and Moravia. They had their own confession,
   catechism and hymnology. [721] Of the 60 Bohemian books printed
   1500-1510, 50 are said to have been by members of the sect. A new
   period in their history was introduced by Lucas of Prag, d. 1528, a
   voluminous writer. He gave explanations of the Brethren's doctrine of
   the Lord's Supper to Luther. Brethren, including Michael Weiss, the
   hymnwriter, visited the German Reformer, and in 1521 he had in his
   possession their catechism.

   The merciless persecutions of the Brethren and the other remaining
   Hussite sectarists were opened under the Austrian rule of Ferdinand I.
   in 1549, and continued, with interruptions, till the Thirty Years' War
   when, under inspiration of the Jesuits, the government resorted to
   measures memorable for their heartlessness to blot out heresy from
   Bohemia and Moravia.

   The Church of the Brethren had a remarkable resurrection in the
   Moravians, starting with the settlement of Christian David and other
   Hussite families in 1722 on land given by Count Zinzendorf at Herrnhut.
   They preserve the venerable name of their spiritual ancestry, Unitas
   Fratrum, and they have made good their heritage by their missionary
   labors which have carried the Gospel to the remotest ends of the earth,
   from Greenland to the West Indies and Guiana, and from the leper colony
   of Jerusalem to Thibet and Australia. In our own land, David Zeisberger
   and other Moravian missionaries have shown in their labors among the
   Indian tribes the godly devotion of John Huss, whose body the flames at
   Constance were able to destroy, but not his sacred memory and
   influence.

   [714] Pius had received at Mt. Tabor hospitable treatment from the
   Hussites, whom he was afterwards to treat with wonted papal arrogance.
   Travelling through Bohemia on a mission from Frederick III., and
   benighted, he preferred to trust himself to the Taborites rather than
   to their enemies. Although he had found refuge with them, he used
   ridicule in describing their poverty and peasant condition. Some he
   found almost naked, some wore only a sheepskin over their bodies, some
   had no saddle, some no reins for their horses. And yet he was obliged
   to say that, though they were bound by no compulsory system of tithes,
   they filled their priests' houses with corn, wood, vegetables and meat.

   [715] The Utraquists came into contact with Luther as early as 1519. At
   the time of the Leipzig Colloquy, two of their preachers in Prag, John
   Poduschka and Wenzel Rosdalowsky, wrote him letters. The first also
   sent Luther a gift of knives, and the second, Huss' work On the Church,
   which was reprinted in Wittenberg, 1620. Luther replied by sending them
   some of his smaller writings. Köstlin, M. Luther, I. 290.

   Müller, Herzog Enc., III. 448, comes to the same conclusion. He is,
   however in doubt whether Chelcicky was associated with the Waldenses.
   Goll is of the opinion that he was strongly influenced by them. Preger,
   Ueber d. Verhältniss der Taboriten zu den Waldesiern des 14ten Jahrh.,
   Munich, 1887, occupies an isolated position when he represents the
   Taborites as a continuation of the Bohemian Waldenses, with some
   modification. These two bodies were separate when the Bohemian Brethren
   began to appear on the scene.

   [719] So Lucas of Prag. See his writings in Goll, pp. 107, 112. De
   Schweinitz, Hist. of the Un. Fratrum, p. 141 sqq., accepts the
   ordination of Stephen as regular. Müller questions it, Herzog, III.
   452.

   [720] See Goll, p. 87, and the letter to Rokyzana, whose nephew Gregory
   belonged to the Lititz colony, p. 92. Of the consecration of Michael by
   Stephen there is no doubt. There is some uncertainty about the details.

   Note. - The works of Creighton, Gregorovius and Pastor are very full.
   It is doubtful whether any period of history has been treated so
   thoroughly and satisfactorily by three contemporary historians. Pastor
   and Gregorovius have used new documents discovered by themselves in the
   archives of Mantua, Milan, Modena, Florence, the Vatican, etc. Pastor's
   notes are vols. of erudite investigation. Creighton is judicial but
   inclined to be too moderate in his estimate of the vices of the popes,
   and in details not always reliable. Gregorovius' narration is searching
   and brilliant. He is unsparing in his reprobation of the dissoluteness
   of Roman society and backs his statements with authorities. Pastor's
   masterly and graphic treatment is the most extensive work on the
   period. Although written with ultramontane prepossessions, it is often
   unsparing when it deals with the corruption of popes and cardinals,
   especially Alexander VI., who has never been set forth in darker colors
   since the 16th century than on its pages.

   The period of the Reformatory councils, closing with the Basel-Ferrara
   synod, was followed by a period notable in the history of the papacy,
   the period of the Renaissance popes. These pontiffs of the last years
   of the Middle Ages were men famous alike for their intellectual
   endowments, the prostitution of their office to personal aggrandizement
   and pleasure and the lustre they gave to Rome by their patronage of
   letters and the fine arts. The decree of the Council of Constance,
   asserting the supreme authority of oecumenical councils, treated as a
   dead letter by Eugenius IV., was definitely set aside by Pius II. in a
   bull forbidding appeals from papal decisions and affirming finality for
   the pope's authority. For 70 years no general assembly of the Church
   was called.

   The ten pontiffs who sat on the pontifical throne, 1450-1517,
   represented in their origin the extremes of fortune, from the
   occupation of the fisherman, as in the case of Sixtus IV., to the
   refinement of the most splendid aristocracy of the age, as in the case
   of Leo X. of the family of the Medici. In proportion as they
   embellished Rome and the Vatican with the treasures of art, did they
   seem to withhold themselves from that sincere religious devotion which
   would naturally be regarded as a prime characteristic of one claiming
   to be the chief pastor of the Christian Church on earth. No great
   principle of administration occupied their minds. No conspicuous
   movement of pious activity received their sanction, unless the proposed
   crusade to reconquer Constantinople be accounted such, but into that
   purpose papal ambition entered more freely than devotion to the
   interests of religion.

   This period was the flourishing age of nepotism in the Vatican. The
   bestowment of papal favors by the pontiffs upon their nephews and other
   relatives dates as a recognized practice from Boniface VIII. In vain
   did papal conclaves, following the decree of Constance, adopt
   protocols, making the age of 30 the lowest limit for appointment to the
   sacred college, and putting a check on papal favoritism. Ignoring the
   instincts of modesty and the impulse of religion, the popes bestowed
   the red hat upon their young nephews and grandnephews and upon the sons
   of princes, in spite of their utter disqualification both on the ground
   of intelligence and of morals. The Vatican was beset by relatives of
   the pontiffs, hungry for the honors and the emoluments of office. Here
   are some of those who were made cardinals before they were 30: Calixtus
   III. appointed his nephews, Juan and Rodrigo Borgia (Alexander VI.),
   the latter 25, and the little son of the king of Portugal; Pius II.,
   his nephew at 23, and Francis Gonzaga at 17; Sixtus IV., John of Aragon
   at 14, his nephews, Peter and Julian Rovere, at 25 and 28, and his
   grandnephew, Rafaelle Riario, at 17; Innocent VIII., John Sclafenatus
   at 23, Giovanni de' Medici at 13; Alexander VI., in 1493, Hippolito of
   Este at 15, whom Sixtus had made archbishop of Strigonia at 8, his son,
   Caesar Borgia, at 18, Alexander Farnese (Paul III.), brother of the
   pope's mistress, at 25, and Frederick Casimir, son of the king of
   Poland, at 19; Leo X., in 1513, his nephew, Innocent Cibo, at 21, and
   his cousin, the illegitimate Julius de' Medici, afterwards Clement
   VII., and in 1517 three more nephews, one of them the bastard son of
   his brother, also Alfonzo of Portugal at 7, and John of Loraine, son of
   the duke of Sicily, at 20. This is an imperfect list. [722] Bishoprics,
   abbacies and other ecclesiastical appointments were heaped upon the
   papal children, nephews and other favorites. The cases in which the red
   hat was conferred for piety or learning were rare, while the houses of
   Mantua, Ferrara and Modena, the Medici of Florence, the Sforza of
   Milan, the Colonna and the Orsini had easy access to the Apostolic
   camera.

   The cardinals vied with kings in wealth and luxury, and their palaces
   were enriched with the most gorgeous furnishings and precious plate,
   and filled with servants. They set an example of profligacy which they
   carried into the Vatican itself. The illegitimate offspring of pontiffs
   were acknowledged without a blush, and the sons and daughters of the
   highest houses in Italy, France and Spain were sought in marriage for
   them by their indulgent fathers. The Vatican was given up to nuptial
   and other entertainments, even women of ill-repute being invited to
   banquets and obscene comedies performed in its chambers.

   The prodigal expenditures of the papal household were maintained in
   part by the great sums, running into tens of thousands of ducats, which
   rich men were willing to pay for the cardinalate. When the funds of the
   Vatican ran low, loans were secured from the Fuggers and other banking
   houses and the sacred things of the Vatican put in pawn, even to the
   tiara itself. The amounts required by Alexander VI. for marriage
   dowries for his children, and by Leo X. for nephews, were enormous.

   Popes, like Sixtus IV. and Alexander VI., had no scruple about
   involving Italy in internecine wars in order to compass the papal
   schemes either in the enlargement of papal domain or the enrichment of
   papal sons and nephews. Julius II. was a warrior and went to the
   battle-field in armor. No sovereign of his age was more unscrupulous in
   resorting to double dealing in his diplomacy than was Leo X. To reach
   the objects of its ambition, the holy see was ready even to form
   alliances with the sultan. The popes, so Döllinger says, from Paul II.
   to Leo X., did the most it was possible to do to cover the papacy with
   shame and disgrace and to involve Italy in the horrors of endless wars.
   [723] The Judas-like betrayal of Christ in the highest seat of
   Christendom, the gayeties, scandals and crimes of popes as they pass
   before the reader in the diaries of Infessura, Burchard and de Grassis
   and the despatches of the ambassadors of Venice, Mantua and other
   Italian states, and as repeated by Creighton, Pastor and Gregorovius,
   make this period one of the most dramatic in human annals. The personal
   element furnished scene after scene of consuming interest. It seems to
   the student as if history were approaching some great climax.

   Three events of permanent importance for the general history of mankind
   also occurred in this age, the overthrow of the Byzantine empire, 1453,
   the discovery of the Western world, 1492, and the invention of
   printing. It closed with a general council, the Fifth Lateran, which
   adjourned only a few months before the Reformer in the North shook the
   papal fabric to its base and opened the door of the modern age.

   § 49. Nicolas V. 1447-1455.

   Nicolas V., 1447-1455, the successor of Bugenius IV., was ruled by the
   spirit of the new literary culture, the Renaissance, and was the first
   Maecenas in a line of popes like-minded. Following his example, his
   successors were for a century among the foremost patrons of art and
   letters in Europe. What Gregory VII. was to the system of the papal
   theocracy, that Nicolas was to the artistic revival in Rome. Under his
   rule, the eternal city witnessed the substantial beginnings of that
   transformation, in which it passed from a spectacle of ruins and
   desertion to a capital adorned with works of art and architectural
   construction. He himself repaired and beautified the Vatican and St.
   Peter's, laid the foundation of the Vatican library and called scholars
   and artists to his court. [724]

   Thomas Parentucelli, born 1397, the son of a physician of Sarzana, owed
   nothing of his distinction to the position of his family. His father
   was poor, and the son was little of stature, with disproportionately
   short legs. What he lacked, however, in bodily parts, he made up in
   intellectual endowments, tact and courtesies of manner. His education
   at Bologna being completed, his ecclesiastical preferment was rapid. In
   1444, he was made archbishop of Bologna and, on his return from Germany
   as papal legate, 1446, he was honored with the red hat. Four months
   later he was elevated to the papal throne, and according to Aeneas
   Sylvius, whose words about the eminent men of his day always have a
   diplomatic flavor, Thomas was so popular that there was no one who did
   not approve his election.

   To Nicolas was given the notable distinction of witnessing the complete
   reunion of Western Christendom. By the abdication of Felix V., whom he
   treated with discreet and liberal generosity, and by Germany's
   abandonment of its attitude of neutrality, he could look back upon
   papal schism and divided obediences as matters of the past.

   The Jubilee Year, celebrated in 1450, was adapted to bind the European
   nations closely to Rome, and to stir up anew the fires of devotion
   which had languished during the ecclesiastical disputes of nearly a
   century. [725] So vast were the throngs of pilgrims that the
   contemporary, Platina, felt justified in asserting that such multitudes
   had never been seen in the holy city before. According to Aeneas,
   40,000 went daily from church to church. The handkerchief of St.
   Veronica,--lo sudario,--bearing the outline of the Lord's face, was
   exhibited every Sabbath, and the heads of St. Peter and St. Paul every
   Saturday. The large sums of money which the pilgrims left, Nicolas knew
   well how to use in carrying out his plans for beautifying the churches
   and streets of the city.

   The calamity, which occurred on the bridge of St. Angelo, and cast a
   temporary gloom over the festivities of the holy year, is noticed by
   all the contemporary writers. The mule belonging to Peter Barbus,
   cardinal of St. Mark's, was crushed to death, so dense were the crowds,
   and in the excitement two hundred persons or more were trodden down or
   drowned by being pushed or throwing themselves into the Tiber. To
   prevent a repetition of the disaster, the pope had several buildings
   obstructing the passage to the bridge pulled down. [726]

   In the administration of the properties of the holy see, Nicolas was
   discreet and successful. He confirmed the papal rule over the State of
   the Church, regained Bolsena and the castle of Spoleto, and secured the
   submission of Bologna, to which he sent Bessarion as papal legate. The
   conspiracy of Stephen Porcaro, who emulated the ambitions of Rienzo,
   was put down in 1453 and left the pope undisputed master of Rome. In
   his selection of cardinals he was wise, Nicolas of Cusa being included
   in the number. The appointment of his younger brother, Philip
   Calandrini, to the sacred college, aroused no unfavorable criticism.

   Nicolas' reign witnessed, in 1452, the last coronation in Rome of a
   German emperor, Frederick III. This monarch, who found in his
   councillor, Aeneas Sylvius, an enthusiastic biographer, but who, by the
   testimony of others, was weak and destitute of martial spirit and
   generous qualities, was the first of the Hapsburgs to receive the crown
   in the holy city, and held the imperial office longer than any other of
   the emperors before or after him. With his coronation the emperor
   combined the celebration of his nuptials to Leonora of Portugal.

   Frederick's journey to Italy and his sojourn in Rome offered to the pen
   of Aeneas a rare opportunity for graphic description, of which he was a
   consummate master. The meeting with the future empress, the welcome
   extended to his majesty, the festivities of the marriage and the
   coronation, the trappings of the soldiery, the blowing of the horns,
   the elegance of the vestments worn by the emperor and his visit to the
   artistic wonders of St. Peter's,--these and other scenes the shrewd and
   facile Aeneas depicted. The Portuguese princess, whose journey from
   Lisbon occupied 104 days, disembarked at Leghorn, February, 1452, where
   she was met by Frederick, attended by a brilliant company of knights.
   After joining in gay entertainments at Siena, lasting four days, the
   party proceeded to Rome. Leonora, who was only sixteen, was praised by
   those who saw her for her rare beauty and charms of person. She was to
   become the mother of Maximilian and the ancestress of Charles V. [727]

   On reaching the gates of the papal capital, Frederick was met by the
   cardinals, who offered him the felicitations of the head of
   Christendom, but also demanded from him the oath of allegiance, which
   was reluctantly promised. The ceremonies, which followed the emperor's
   arrival, were such as to flatter his pride and at the same time to
   confirm the papal tenure of power in the city. Frederick was received
   by Nicolas on the steps of St. Peter's, seated in an ivory chair, and
   surrounded by his cardinals, standing. The imperial visitor knelt and
   kissed the pontiff's foot. On March 16, Nicolas crowned him with the
   iron crown of Lombardy and united the imperial pair in marriage.
   Leonora then went to her own palace, and Frederick to the Vatican as
   its guest. The reason for his lodging near the pope was that Nicolas
   might have opportunity for frequent communication with him or, as rumor
   went, to prevent the Romans approaching him under cover of darkness
   with petitions for the restoration of their liberties. [728] Three days
   later, March 19, the crown of the empire was placed upon Frederick's
   head. [729] With his consort he then received the elements from the
   pope's hand. The following week Frederick proceeded to Naples. [730]

   Scarcely in any pontificate has so notable and long-forecasted an event
   occurred as the fall of Constantinople into the hands of the Turks,
   which took place May 29, 1453. The last of the Constantines perished in
   the siege, fighting bravely at the gate of St. Romanos. The church of
   Justinian, St. Sophia, was turned into a mosque, and a cross,
   surmounted with a janissary's cap, was carried through the streets,
   while the soldiers shouted, "This is the Christian's God." This
   historic catastrophe would have been regarded in Western Europe as
   appalling, if it had not been expected. The steady advance of the Turks
   and their unspeakable atrocities had kept the Greek empire in alarm for
   centuries. Three hundred years before, Latin Christendom had been
   taught to expect defeats at the hands of the Mohammedans in the taking
   of Edessa, 1145, and the fatal battle of Hattin and the loss of
   Jerusalem, 1187.

   In answer to the appeals of the Greeks, Nicolas despatched Isidore as
   legate to Constantinople with a guard of 200 troops, but, as a
   condition of helping the Eastern emperor, he insisted that the Ferrara
   articles of union be ratified in Constantinople. In a long
   communication, dated Oct. 11, 1451, the Roman pontiff declared that
   schisms had always been punished more severely than other evils. Korah,
   Dathan and Abiram, who attempted to divide the people of God, received
   a more bitter punishment than those who introduced idolatry. There
   could not be two heads to an empire or the Church. There is no
   salvation outside of the one Church. He was lost in the flood who was
   not housed in Noah's ark. Whatever opinion it may have entertained of
   these claims, the Byzantine court was in too imminent danger to reject
   the papal condition, and in December, 1452, Isidore, surrounded by 300
   priests, announced, in the church of St. Sophia, the union of the Greek
   and Latin communions. But even now the Greek people violently resented
   the union, and the most powerful man of the empire, Lucas Notaras,
   announced his preference for the turban to the tiara. The aid offered
   by Nicolas was at best small. The last week of April, 1453, ten papal
   galleys set sail with some ships from Naples, Venice and Genoa, but
   they were too late to render any assistance. [731]

   The termination of the venerable and once imposing fabric on the
   Bosphorus by the Asiatic invader was the only fate possible for an
   empire whose rulers, boasting themselves the successors of Constantine,
   Theodosius and Justinian, Christian in name and most Christian by the
   standard of orthodox professions, had heaped their palaces full of
   pagan luxury and excess. The government, planted in the most imperial
   spot on the earth, had forfeited the right to exist by an insipid and
   nerveless reliance upon the traditions of the past. No elements of
   revival manifested themselves from within. Religious formulas had been
   substituted for devotion. Much as the Christian student may regret the
   loss of this last bulwark of Christianity in the East, he will be
   inclined to find in the disaster the judgment realized with which the
   seven churches of the Apocalypse were threatened which were not worthy.
   The problem which was forced upon Europe by the arrival of the Grand
   Turk, as contemporaries called Mohammed II., still awaits solution from
   wise diplomacy or force of arms or through the slow and silent movement
   of modern ideas of government and popular rights.

   The disaster which overtook the Eastern empire, Nicolas V. felt would
   be regarded by after generations as a blot upon his pontificate, and
   others, like Aeneas Sylvius, shared this view. [732]

   He issued a bull summoning the Christian nations to a crusade for the
   recovery of Constantinople, and stigmatized Mohammed II. as the dragon
   described in the Book of Revelation. Absolution was offered to those
   who would spend six months in the holy enterprise or maintain a
   representative for that length of time. Christendom was called upon to
   contribute a tenth. The cardinals were enjoined to do the same, and all
   the papal revenues accruing from larger and smaller benefices, from
   bishoprics, archbishoprics and convents, were promised for the
   undertaking.

   Feeble was the response which Europe gave. The time of crusading
   enthusiasm was passed. The Turk was daring and to be dreaded. An
   assembly called by Frederick III., at Regensburg in the Spring of 1454,
   at which the emperor himself did not put in an appearance, listened to
   an eloquent appeal by Aeneas, but adjourned the subject to the diet to
   meet in Frankfurt in October. Again the emperor was not present, and
   the diet did nothing. Down to the era of the Reformation the crusade
   against the Turk remained one of the chief official concerns of the
   papacy.

   If Nicolas died disappointed over his failure to influence the princes
   to undertake a campaign against the Turks, his fame abides as the
   intelligent and genial patron of letters and the arts. In this rôle he
   laid after generations under obligation to him as Innocent III., by his
   crusading armies, did not. He lies buried in St. Peter's at the side of
   his predecessor, Eugenius IV. [733]

   The next pontiff, the Spaniard, Calixtus III., 1455-1458, had two chief
   concerns, the dislodgment of the Turks from Constantinople and the
   advancement of the fortunes of the Borgia family, to which he belonged.
   Made cardinal by Eugenius IV., he was 77 years old when he was elected
   pope. From his day, the Borgias played a prominent part in Rome, their
   career culminating in the ambitions and scandals of Rodrigo Borgia, for
   30 years cardinal and then pope under the name of Alexander VI.

   Calixtus opened his pontificate by vowing "to Almighty God and the Holy
   Trinity, by wars, maledictions, interdicts, excommunications and in all
   other ways to punish the Turks." [734] Legates were despatched to
   kindle the zeal of princes throughout Europe. Papal jewels were sold,
   and gold and silver clasps were torn from the books of the Vatican and
   turned into money. At a given hour daily the bells were rung in Rome
   that all might give themselves to prayer for the sacred war. But to the
   indifference of most of the princes was added active resistance on the
   part of France. Venice, always looking out for her own interests, made
   a treaty with the Turks. Frederick III. was incompetent. The weak fleet
   the pope was able to muster sailed forth from Ostia under Cardinal
   Serampo to empty victories. The gallant Hungarian, Hunyady, brought
   some hope by his brilliant feat in relieving Belgrade, July 14, 1456,
   but the rejoicing was reduced by the news of the gallant leader's
   death. Scanderbeg, the Albanian, who a year later was appointed papal
   captain-general, was indeed a brave hero, but, unsupported by Western
   Europe, he was next to powerless.

   Calixtus' unblushing nepotism surpassed anything of the kind which had
   been known in the papal household before. Catalan adventurers pressed
   into Rome and stormed their papal fellow-countrymen with demands for
   office. Upon the three sons of two of his sisters, Juan of Milan, son
   of Catherine Borgia, and Pedro Luis and Rodrigo, sons of Isabella, he
   heaped favor after favor. Adopted by their uncle, Pedro and Rodrigo
   were the objects of his sleepless solicitude. Gregorovius has compared
   the members of the Borgia family to the Roman Claudii. By the endowment
   of nature they were vigorous and handsome, and by nature and practice,
   sensual, ambitious, and high-handed,--their coat of arms a bull. Under
   protest from the curia, Rodrigo and Juan of Milan were made cardinals,
   1457, both the young men still in their twenties.

   Their unsavory habits were already a byword in Rome. Rodrigo was soon
   promoted over the heads of the other members of the sacred college to
   the place of vice-chancellor, the most lucrative position within the
   papal gift. At the same time, the little son--figliolo -- of the king
   of Portugal, as Infessura calls him, was given the red hat.

   With astounding rapidity Pedro Luis, who remained a layman, was
   advanced to the highest positions in the state, and made governor of
   St. Angelo and duke of Spoleto, and put in possession of Terni, Narni,
   Todi and other papal fiefs. [735] It was supposed that it was the fond
   uncle's intention, at the death of Alfonso of Naples, to invest this
   nephew with the Neapolitan crown by setting aside Alfonso's
   illegitimate son, Don Ferrante.

   Calixtus' death was the signal for the flight of the Spanish lobbyists,
   whose houses were looted by the indignant Romans. Discerning the coming
   storm, Pedro made the best bargain he could by selling S. Angelo to the
   cardinals for 20,000 ducats, and then took a hasty departure.

   Like Honorius III., Calixtus might have died of a broken heart over his
   failure to arouse Europe to the effort of a crusade, if it had not been
   for this consuming concern for the fortunes and schemes of his
   relatives. From this time on, for more than half a century, the gift of
   dignities and revenues under papal control for personal considerations
   and to unworthy persons for money was an outstanding feature in the
   history of the popes.

   [727] Infessura, p. 52, says that language could not exaggerate
   Leonora's beauty, bella quanto si potesse dire. Aeneas, Hist. Frid.,
   265, speaks of her dark complexion, jet-black and lustrous eyes, her
   soft red cheeks, her intelligent expression, and her snow-white neck,
   "in every particular a charming person."

   [728] Hist. Frid., 294; Ilgen, II. 84 sq. Aeneas gives the alternate
   reason for the hospitality shown to his master.

   [729] The crown used on the occasion was reputed to be the one used by
   Charlemagne which Sigismund had removed to Nürnberg. Aeneas, with his
   usual journalistic love of detail, noticed the Bohemian lion of Charles
   IV. engraven on the sword, which also was brought from Nürnberg.

   [730] Aeneas, p. 303, who is scrupulous in stating from time to time
   that Frederick and Leonora lodged in different palaces or tents, now
   gives a detailed account of the circumstances attending their first
   lodging together as man and wife in Naples. The account is such as we
   might expect from Boccaccio and not from a prelate of the Church, but
   Aeneas' own record fitted him for entering with pruriency into
   realistic details. They are characteristic of the times and of Spanish
   customs.

   [731] Pastor, I. 588 sqq., devotes much space to an attempt to show
   that Nicolas made an effort to help the Greeks. Infessura blames him
   for making none.

   [732] Aeneas wrote, July 12, 1453, to the pope: "Historians of the
   Roman pontiffs, when they reach your time, will write, 'Nicolas V., a
   Tuscan, was pope for so many years. He recovered the patrimony of the
   Church from the hands of tyrants, he gave union to the divided Church,
   he canonized Bernardino, he built the Vatican and splendidly restored
   St. Peter's, he celebrated the Jubilee and crowned Frederick III.' All
   this will be obscured by the doleful addition, 'In his time
   Constantinople was taken and plundered by the Turks.' Your holiness did
   what you could. No blame can be justly attached to you. But the
   ignorance of posterity will blame you when it hears that in your time
   Constantinople was lost." Gibbon makes the observation that "The
   pontificate of Nicolas V., however powerful and prosperous, was
   dishonored by the fall of the Eastern Empire," ch. LXVIII. It was not
   within Nicolas' power to avert the disaster.

   § 50. Aeneas Sylvius de' Piccolomini, Pius II.

   The next pontiff, Pius II., has a place among the successful men of
   history. Lacking high enthusiasms and lofty aims, he was constantly
   seeking his own interests and, through diplomatic shrewdness, came to
   be the most conspicuous figure of his time. He was ruled by expediency
   rather than principle. He never swam against the stream. [736] When he
   found himself on the losing side, he was prompt in changing to the
   other.

   Aeneas Sylvius de' Piccolomini was born in 1405 at Corsignano, a
   village located on a bold spur of the hills near Siena. He was one of
   18 children, and his family, which had been banished from Siena, was
   poor but of noble rank. At 18, the son began studying in the
   neighboring city, where he heard Bernardino preach. Later he learned
   Greek in Florence. It was a great opportunity when Cardinal Capranica
   took this young man with him as his secretary to Basel, 1431.
   Gregorovius has remarked that it was the golden age of secretaries,
   most of the Humanists serving in that capacity. Later, Aeneas went into
   the service of the bishop of Novaro, whom he accompanied to Rome. The
   bishop was imprisoned for the part he had taken in a conspiracy against
   Eugenius IV. The secretary escaped a like treatment by flight. He then
   served Cardinal Albergati, with whom he travelled to France. He also
   visited England and Scotland. [737]

   Returning to Basel, Aeneas became one of the conspicuous personages in
   the council, was a member, and often acted as chairman of one of the
   four committees, the committee on faith, and was sent again and again
   on embassies to Strassburg, Frankfurt, Trent and other cities. The
   council also appointed him its chief abbreviator. In 1440 he decided in
   favor of the rump-synod, which continued to meet in Basel, and espoused
   the cause of Felix V., who made him his secretary. The same year he
   wrote the tract on general councils. [738] Finding the cause of the
   anti-pope waning, he secured a place under Frederick III., and
   succeeded to the full in ingratiating himself in that monarch's favor.
   His Latin epigrams and verses won for him the appointment of
   poet-laureate, and his diplomatic cleverness and versatility the
   highest place in the royal council. At first he joined with Schlick,
   the chancellor, in holding Frederick to a neutral attitude between
   Eugenius and the anti-pope, but then, turning apostate to the cause of
   neutrality, gracefully and unreservedly gave in his submission to the
   Roman pontiff. While on an embassy to Rome, 1445, he excused himself
   before Eugenius for his errors at Basel on the plea of lack of
   experience. He at once became useful to the pope, and a year later
   received the appointment of papal secretary. By his persuasion,
   Frederick transferred his obedience to Eugenius, which Aeneas was able
   to announce in person to the pope a few days before his death. From
   Nicolas V. he received the sees of Trieste, 1447, and Siena, 1450, and
   in 1456 promotion to the college of cardinals.

   At the time of his election as pope, Aeneas was 53 years old. He had
   risen by tact and an accurate knowledge of men and European affairs. He
   was a thorough man of the world, and capable of grasping a situation in
   a glance. He had been profligate, and his love affairs were many. A son
   was born to him in Scotland, and another, by an Englishwoman, in
   Strassburg. In a letter to his father, asking him to adopt the second
   child, he described, without concealment and apparently without shame,
   the measures he took to seduce the mother. He spoke of wantonness as an
   old vice. He himself was no eunuch nor without passion. He could not
   claim to be wiser than Solomon nor holier than David. Aeneas also used
   his pen in writing tales of love adventures. His History of Frederick
   III. contains prurient details that would not be tolerated in a
   respectable author to-day. He was even ready to instruct youth in
   methods of self-indulgence, and wrote to Sigismund, the young duke of
   the Tyrol, neither to neglect literature nor to deny himself the
   blandishments of Venus. [739] This advice was recalled to his face by
   the canonist George von Heimburg at the Congress of Mantua. The famous
   remark belongs to Aeneas that the celibacy of the clergy was at one
   time with good reason made subject of positive legislation, but the
   time had come when there was better reason for allowing priests to
   marry. He himself did not join the clerical order till 1446, when he
   was consecrated subdeacon. Before Pius' election, [740] the conclave
   bound the coming pope to prosecute the war against the Turk, to observe
   the rules of the Council of Constance about the sacred college and to
   consult its members before making new appointments to bishoprics and
   the greater abbeys. Nominations of cardinals were to be made to the
   camera, and their ratification to depend upon a majority of its votes.
   Each cardinal whose income did not amount to 4,000 florins was to
   receive 100 florins a month till the sum of 4,000 was reached. This
   solemn compact formed a precedent which the cardinals for more than
   half a century followed.

   Aeneas' constitution was already shattered. He was a great sufferer
   from the stone, the gout and a cough, and spent many months of his
   pontificate at Viterbo and other baths. His rule was not distinguished
   by any enduring measures. He conducted himself well, had the respect of
   the Romans, received the praise of contemporary biographers, and did
   all he could to further the measures for the expulsion of the Turks
   from Europe. He appointed the son of his sister, Laodamia, cardinal at
   the age of 23, and in 1461 he bestowed the same dignity on Francis
   Gonzaga, a youth of only 17. These appointments seem to have awakened
   no resentment.

   To advance the interest of the crusade against the Turks, Pius called a
   congress of princes to meet in Mantua, 1460. On his way thither,
   accompanied by Bessarion, Borgia and other cardinals, he visited his
   birthplace, Corsignana, and raised it to a bishopric, changing its name
   to Pienza. He also began the construction of a palace and cathedral
   which still endure. Siena he honored by conferring the Golden Rose on
   its signiory, and promoting the city to the dignity of a metropolitan
   see. He also enriched it with one of John the Baptist's arms. Florence
   arranged for the pope's welcome brilliant amusements,--theatrical
   plays, contests of wild beasts, races between lions and horses, and
   dances,--worldly rather than religious spectacles, as Pastor remarks.

   The princes were slow in arriving in Mantua, and the attendance was not
   such as to justify the opening of the congress till Sept. 26. Envoys
   from Thomas Palaeologus of the Morea, brother of the last Byzantine
   emperor, from Lesbos, Cyprus, Rhodes and other parts of the East were
   on hand to pour out their laments. In his opening address, lasting
   three hours, Pius called upon the princes to emulate Stephen, Peter,
   Andrew, Sebastian, St. Lawrence and other martyrs in readiness to lay
   down their lives in the holy war. The aggression of the Turks had
   robbed Christendom of some of its fairest seats,--Antioch, where the
   followers of Christ for the first time received the name Christians,
   Solomon's temple, where Christ so often preached, Bethlehem, where he
   was born, the Jordan, in which he was baptized, Tabor, on which he was
   transfigured, Calvary, where he was crucified. If they wanted to retain
   their own possessions, their wives, their children, their liberty, the
   very faith in which they were baptized, they must believe in war and
   carry on war. Joshua continued to have victory over his enemies till
   the sun went down; Gideon, with 300, scattered the Midianites;
   Jephthah, with a small army, put to flight the swarms of the Ammonites;
   Samson had brought the proud Philistines to shame; Godfrey, with a
   handful of men, had destroyed an innumerable number of the enemy and
   slaughtered the Turks like cattle. Passionately the papal orator
   exclaimed, O! that Godfrey were once more present, and Baldwin and
   Eustache and Bohemund and Tancred, and the other mighty men who broke
   through the ranks of the Turks and regained Jerusalem by their arms.
   [741]

   The assembly was stirred to a great heat, but, so a contemporary says,
   the ardor soon cooled. Cardinal Bessarion followed Pius with an address
   which also lasted three hours. Of eloquence there was enough, but the
   crusading age was over. The conquerors of Jerusalem had been asleep for
   nearly 400 years. Splendid orations could not revive that famous
   outburst of enthusiasm which followed Urban's address at Clermont. In
   this case the element of romance was wanting which the conquest of the
   Holy Sepulchre had furnished. The prowess of the conquering Turks was a
   hard fact.

   During the Congress of Mantua the controversy broke out between the
   German lawyer, Gregor of Heimburg, and Pius. They had met before at
   Basel. Heimburg, representing the duke of the Tyrol, who had imprisoned
   Nicolas of Cusa spoke against the proposed crusade. He openly insulted
   the pope by keeping on his hat in his presence, an indignity he
   jokingly explained as a precaution against the catarrh. From the
   sentence of excommunication, pronounced against his ducal master, he
   appealed to a general council, August 13, 1460. He himself was punished
   with excommunication, and Pius called upon the city of Nürnberg to
   expel him as the child of the devil and born of the artifice of lies.
   Heimburg became a wanderer until the removal of the ban, 1472. He was
   the strongest literary advocate in Germany of the Basel decrees and the
   superiority of councils, and has been called a predecessor of Luther
   and precursor of the Reformation. [742] Diether, archbishop of Mainz,
   another advocate of the conciliar system, who entered into compacts
   with the German princes to uphold the Basel decrees and to work for a
   general council on German soil, was deposed, 1461, as Hermann,
   archbishop of Cologne, was deposed a hundred years later for
   undertaking measures of reform in his diocese.

   Pius left Mantua the last of January, 1461, stopping on the return
   journey a second time at his beloved Siena, and canonizing its
   distinguished daughter, Catherine. [743] Here Rodrigo Borgia's gayeties
   were so notorious as to call forth papal rebuke. The cardinal gave
   banquets to which women were invited without their husbands. In a
   severe letter to the future supreme pontiff, Pius spoke of the dancing
   at the entertainments as being performed, so he understood, with "all
   licentiousness."

   The ease with which Pius, when it was to his interest, renounced
   theories which he once advocated is shown in two bulls. The first, the
   famous bull, Execrabilis, declared it an accursed and unheard-of abuse
   to make appeal to a council from the decisions of the Roman pontiff,
   Christ's vicar, to whom it was given to feed his sheep and to bind and
   loose on earth and in heaven. To rid the Church of this pestiferous
   venom,--pestiferum virus,--it announced the papal purpose to damn such
   appeals and to lay upon the appellants a curse from which there could
   be no absolution except by the Roman pontiff himself and in the article
   of death. [744] Thus the solemn principle which had bloomed so
   promisingly in the fair days of the councils of Constance and Basel,
   and for which Gerson and D'Ailly had so zealously contended, was set
   aside by one stroke of the pen. Thenceforward, the decree announced,
   papal decisions were to be treated as final.

   Three years later, April 26, 1463, the theory of the supremacy of
   general councils was set aside in still more precise language. [745] In
   an elaborate letter addressed to the rector and scholars of the
   University of Cologne, Pius pronounced for the monarchical form of
   government in the church--monarchicum regimen -- as being of divine
   origin, and the one given to Peter. As storks follow one leader, and as
   the bees have one king, so the militant church has in the vicar of
   Christ one who is moderator and arbiter of all. He receives his
   authority directly from Christ without mediation. He is the
   prince--praesul -- of all the bishops, the heir of the Apostles, of the
   line of Abel and Melchisedek. As for the Council Of Constance, Pius
   expressed his regard for its decrees so far as they were approved by
   his predecessors, but the definitions of general councils, he affirmed,
   are subject to the sanction of the supreme pontiff, Peter's successor.
   With reference to his former utterances at Basel, he expressly revoked
   anything he had said in conflict with the positions taken in the bull,
   and ascribed those statements to immaturity of mind, the imprudence of
   youth and the circumstances of his early training. Quis non errat
   mortalis--what mortal does not make mistakes, he exclaimed. Reject
   Aeneas and follow Pius--Aeneam rejicite, Pium recipite -- he said. The
   first was a Gentile name given by parents at the birth of their son;
   the second, the name he had adopted on his elevation to the Apostolic
   see. [746]

   It would not be ingenuous to deny to Pius II., in making retractation,
   the virtue of sincerity. A strain of deep feeling runs through its long
   paragraphs which read like the last testament of a man speaking from
   the heart. Inspired by the dignity of his office, the pope wanted to be
   in accord with the long line of his predecessors, some of whom he
   mentioned by name, from Peter and Clement to the Innocents and
   Boniface. In issuing the decree of papal infallibility four centuries
   later, Pius IX. did not excel his predecessor in the art of
   composition; but he had this advantage over him that his announcement
   was stamped with the previous ratification of a general council. The
   two documents of the two popes of the name Pius reach the summit of
   papal assumption and consigned to burial the theories of the final
   authority of general councils and the infallibility of their decrees.

   Scarcely could any two things be thought of more incongruous than Pius
   II.'s culture and the glorious reception he gave in 1462 to the reputed
   head of the Apostle Andrew. This highly prized treasure was brought to
   Italy by Thomas Palaeologus, who, in recognition of his pious
   benevolence toward the holy see, was given the Golden Rose, a palace in
   Rome and an annual allowance of 6,000 ducats. The relic was received
   with ostentatious signs of devotion. Bessarion and two other members of
   the sacred college received it at Narni and conveyed it to Rome. The
   pope, accompanied by the remaining cardinals and the Roman clergy, went
   out to the Ponte Molle to give it welcome. After falling prostrate
   before the Apostle's skull, Pius delivered an appropriate address in
   which he congratulated the dumb fragment upon coming safely out of the
   hands of the Turks to find at last, as a fugitive, a place beside the
   remains of its brother Apostles. The address being concluded, the
   procession reformed and, with Pius borne in the Golden Chair, conducted
   the skull to its last resting-place. The streets were decked in holiday
   attire, and no one showed greater zeal in draping his palace than
   Rodrigo Borgia. The skull was deposited in St. Peter's, after, as
   Platina says, "the sepulchres of some of the popes and cardinals, which
   took up too much room, had been removed." The ceremonies were closed by
   Bessarion in an address in which he expressed the conviction that St.
   Andrew would join with the other Apostles as a protector of Rome and in
   inducing the princes to combine for the expulsion of the Turks. [747]

   In his closing days, Pius II. continued to be occupied with the
   crusade. He had written a memorable letter to Mohammed II. urging him
   to follow his mother's religion and turn Christian, and assuring him
   that, as Clovis and Charlemagne had been renowned Christian sovereigns,
   so he might become Christian emperor over the Bosphorus, Greece and
   Western Asia. No reply is extant. In 1458, the year before the Mantuan
   congress assembled, the crescent had been planted on the Acropolis of
   Athens. All Southern Greece suffered the indignity and horrors of
   Turkish oppression. Servia fell into the hands of the invaders, 1459,
   and Bosnia followed, 1462.

   Pius' bull of 1463, summoning to a crusade, was put aside by the
   princes, but the pontiff, although he was afflicted with serious bodily
   infirmities, the stone and the gout, was determined to set an example
   in the right direction. Like Moses, he wanted, at least, to watch from
   some promontory or ship the battle against the enemies of the cross.
   Financial aid was furnished by the discovery of the alum mines of
   Tolfa, near Civita Vecchia, in 1462, the revenue from which passed into
   the papal treasury and was specially devoted by the conclave of 1464 to
   the crusade. But it availed little. Pius proceeded to Ancona on a
   litter, stopping on the way at Loreto to dedicate a golden cup to the
   Virgin. Philip of Burgundy, upon whom he had placed chief reliance,
   failed to appear. From Frederick III. nothing was to be expected.
   Venice and Hungary alone promised substantial help. The supreme pontiff
   lodged on the promontory in the bishop's palace. But only two vessels
   lay at anchor in the harbor, ready for the expedition. To these were
   added in a few days 14 galleys sent by the doge. Pius saw them as they
   appeared in sight. The display of further heroism was denied him by his
   death two days later. A comparison has been drawn by the historian
   between the pope, with his eye fixed upon the East, and another, a born
   navigator, who perhaps was even then turning his eyes towards the West,
   and before many years was to set sail in equally frail vessels to make
   his momentous discovery.

   On his death-bed, Pius had an argument whether extreme unction, which
   had been administered to him at Basel during an outbreak of the plague,
   might be administered a second time. Among his last words, spoken to
   Cardinal Ammanati, whom he had adopted, were, "pray for me, my son, for
   I am a sinner. Bid my brethren continue this holy expedition." The body
   was carried to Rome and laid away in St. Peter's.

   The disappointment of this restless and remarkable man, in the closing
   undertaking of his busy career, cannot fail to awaken human sympathy.
   Pius, whose aims and methods had been the most practical, was carried
   away at last by a romantic idea, without having the ability to marshal
   the forces for its realization. He misjudged the times. His purpose was
   the purpose of a man whose career had taught him never to tolerate the
   thought of failure. In forming a general estimate, we cannot withhold
   the judgment that, if he had made culture and literary effort prominent
   in the Vatican, his pontificate would have stood out in the history of
   the papacy with singular lustre. It will always seem strange that he
   did not surround himself with literati, as did Nicolas V., and that his
   interest in the improvement of Rome showed itself only in a few minor
   constructions. His biographer, Campanus, declares that he incurred
   great odium by his neglect of the Humanists, and Filelfo, his former
   teacher of Greek, launched against his memory a biting philippic for
   this neglect. The great literary pope proved to be but a poor patron.
   [748] Platina's praise must not be forgotten, when he says, "The pope's
   delight, when he had leisure, was in writing and reading, because he
   valued books more than precious stones, for in them there were plenty
   of gems." What he delighted in as a pastime himself, he seems not to
   have been concerned to use his high position to promote in others. He
   was satisfied with the diplomatic mission of the papacy and deceived by
   the ignis fatuus of a crusade to deliver Constantinople.

   Platina describes Pius at the opening of his pontificate as short,
   gray-haired and wrinkled of face. He rose at daybreak, and was
   temperate at table. His industry was noteworthy. His manner made him
   accessible to all, and he struck the Romans of his age as a man without
   hypocrisy. Looked at as a man of culture, Aeneas was grammarian,
   geographer, historian, novelist and orator. Everywhere he was the keen
   observer of men and events. The plan of his cosmography was laid out on
   a large scale, but was left unfinished. [749] His Commentaries,
   extending from his birth to the time of his death, are a racy example
   of autobiographic literature. His strong hold upon the ecclesiastics
   who surrounded him can only be explained by his unassumed intellectual
   superiority and a certain moral ingenuousness. He is one of the most
   interesting figures of his century. [750]

   § 51. Paul II. 1464-1471.

   The next occupant of the papal throne possessed none of the
   intellectual attractiveness of his predecessor, and displayed no
   interest in promoting the war against the Turks. He was as difficult to
   reach as Pius had been accessible, and was slow in attending to
   official business. The night he turned into day, holding his audiences
   after dark, and legates were often obliged to wait far into the night
   or even as late as three in the morning before getting a hearing.

   Pietro Barbo, the son of a sister of Eugenius IV., was born in Venice,
   1418. He was about to set sail for the East on a mercantile project,
   when the news reached Venice of his uncle's election to the papacy.
   Following his elder brother's advice, he gave up the quest of worldly
   gain and devoted himself to the Church. Eugenius' favor assured him
   rapid promotion, and he was successively appointed archdeacon of
   Bologna, bishop of Cervia, bishop of Vicenza, papal pronotary and
   cardinal. On being elected to the papal chair, the Venetian chose the
   name of Formosus and then Mark, but, at the advice of the conclave,
   both were given up, as the former seemed to carry with it a reference
   to the pontiff's fine presence, and the latter was the battle-cry of
   Venice, and might give political offence. So he took the name, Paul.

   Before entering upon the election, the conclave again adopted a pact
   which required the prosecution of the crusade and the assembling of a
   general council within three years. The number of cardinals was not to
   exceed 24, the age of appointment being not less than 30 years, and the
   introduction of more than one of the pope's relatives to that body was
   forbidden. [751]

   This solemn agreement, Paul proceeded at once summarily to set aside.
   The cardinals were obliged to attach their names to another document,
   whose contents the pope kept concealed by holding his hand over the
   paper as they wrote. The veteran Carvajal was the only member of the
   curia who refused to sign. From the standpoint of papal absolutism,
   Paul was fully justified. What right has any conclave to dictate to the
   supreme pontiff of Christendom, the successor of St. Peter! The pact
   was treason to the high papal theory, and meant nothing less than the
   substitution of an oligarchy for the papal monarchy. Paul called no
   council, not even a congress, to discuss the crusade against the Turks,
   and appointed three of his nephews cardinals, Marco Barbo, his
   brother's son, and Battista Zeno and Giovanni Michïel, sons of two
   sisters. [752] His ordinances for the city included sumptuary
   regulations, limiting the prices to be paid for wearing apparel,
   banquets and entertainments at weddings and funerals, and restricting
   the dowries of daughters to 800 gold florins.

   A noteworthy occurrence of Paul's pontificate was the storm raised in
   Rome, 1466, by his dismissal of the 70 abbreviators, the number to
   which Pius II. had limited the members of that body. This was one of
   those incidents which give variety to the history of the papal court
   and help to make it, upon the whole, the most interesting of all
   histories. The scribes of the papal household were roughly divided into
   two classes, the secretaries and the abbreviators. The business of the
   former was to take charge of the papal correspondence of a more private
   nature, while the latter prepared briefs of bulls and other more solemn
   public documents. [753] The dismissal of the abbreviators got permanent
   notoriety by the complaints of one of their number, Platina, and the
   sufferings he was called upon to endure. This invaluable biographer of
   the popes states that the dispossessed officials, on the plea that
   their appointment had been for life, besieged the Vatican 20 nights
   before getting a hearing. Then Platina, as their spokesman, threatened
   to appeal to the princes of Europe to have a general council called and
   see that justice was done. The pope's curt answer was that he would
   rescind or ratify the acts of his predecessors as he pleased.

   The unfortunate abbreviator, who was more of a scholar than a
   politician, was thrown into prison and held there during the four
   months of Winter without fire and bound in chains. Unhappily for him,
   he was imprisoned a second time, accused of conspiracy and heretical
   doctrine. In these charges the Roman Academy was also involved, an
   institution which cultivated Greek thought and was charged with having
   engaged in a propaganda of Paganism. There was some ground for the
   charge, for its leader, Pomponius Laeto, who combined the care of his
   vineyard with ramblings through the old Roman ruins and the perusal of
   the ancient classics, had deblaterated against the clergy. This
   antiquary was also thrown into prison. Platina relates how he and a
   number of others were put to the torture, while Vienesius, his
   Holiness' vice-chancellor, looked on for several days as the ordeal was
   proceeding, "sitting like another Minos upon a tapestried seat as if he
   had been at a wedding, a man in holy orders whom the canons of the
   Church forbade to put torture upon laymen, lest death should follow, as
   it sometimes does." On his release he received a promise from Paul of
   reappointment to office, but waited in vain till the accession of
   Sixtus IV., who put him in charge of the Vatican library. [754]

   Paul pursued an energetic policy against Podiebrad and the Utraquists
   of Bohemia and, after ordering all the compacts with the king ignored,
   deposed him and called upon Matthias of Hungary to take his throne.
   Paul had rejected Podiebrad's offer to dispossess the Turk on condition
   of being recognized as Byzantine emperor. [755]

   In 1468, Frederick, III. repeated his visit to Rome, accompanied by 600
   knights, but the occasion aroused none of the high expectation of the
   former visit, when the emperor brought with him the Portuguese infanta.
   There was no glittering pageant, no august papal reception. On
   receiving the communion in the basilica of St. Peter's, he received
   from the pontiff's hand the bread, but not the "holy blood," which, as
   the contemporary relates, Paul reserved to himself as an object-lesson
   against the Bohemians, though it was customary on such occasions to
   give both the elements. The successor of Charlemagne and Barbarossa was
   then given a seat at the pope's side, which was no higher than the
   pope's feet. [756] Patritius, who describes the scene, remarks that,
   while the respect paid to the papal dignity had increased, the imperium
   of the Roman empire had fallen into such decadence that nothing
   remained of it but its name. Without manifesting any reluctance, the
   Hapsburg held the pope's stirrup.

   Paul was not without artistic tastes, although he condemned the study
   of the classics in the Roman schools, [757] and was pronounced by
   Platina a great enemy and despiser of learning. He was an ardent
   collector of precious stones, coins, vases and other curios, and took
   delight in showing his jewels to Frederick III. Sixtus IV. is said to
   have found 54 silver chests filled with pearls collected by this
   pontiff, estimated to be worth 300,000 ducats. The two tiaras, made at
   his order, contained gems said to have been worth a like amount. At a
   later time, Cardinal Barbo found in a secret drawer of one of Paul's
   chests sapphires valued at 12,000 ducats. [758] Platina was probably
   repeating only a common rumor, when he reports that in the daytime Paul
   slept and at night kept awake, looking over his jewels.

   To this diversion the pontiff added sensual pleasures and public
   amusements. [759] He humored the popular taste by restoring heathen
   elements to the carnival, figures of Bacchus and the fauna, Diana and
   her nymphs. In the long list of the gayeties of carnival week are
   mentioned races for young men, for old men and for Jews, as well as
   races between horses, donkeys and buffaloes. Paul looked down from St.
   Mark's and delighted the crowds by furnishing a feast in the square
   below and throwing down amongst them handfuls of coins. In things of
   this kind, says Infessura, the pope had his delight. [760] He was
   elaborate in his vestments and, when he appeared in public, was
   accustomed to paint his face.

   The pope's death was ascribed to his indiscretion in eating two large
   melons. Asked by a cardinal why, in spite of the honors of the papacy,
   he was not contented, Paul replied that a little wormwood can pollute a
   whole hive of honey. The words belong in the same category as the words
   spoken 300 years before by the English pope, Adrian, when he announced
   the failure of the highest office in Christendom to satisfy all the
   ambitions of man.

   § 52. Sixtus IV. 1471-1484.

   The last three popes of the 15th century, Sixtus IV., Innocent VIII.
   and Alexander VI., completely subordinated the interests of the papacy
   to the advancement of their own pleasure and the enrichment and
   promotion of their kindred. [761] The avenues of the Vatican were
   filled with upstarts whose only claim to recognition was that they were
   the children or the nephews of its occupant, the supreme pontiff.

   The chief features of the reign of Sixtus IV., a man of great decision
   and ability, were the insolent rule of his numerous nephews and the
   wars with the states of Italy in which their intrigues and ambitions
   involved their uncle. At the time of his election, Francesco Rovere was
   general of the order of the Franciscans. Born 1414, he had risen from
   the lowest obscurity, his father being a fisherman near Savona. He took
   the doctor's degree in theology at Padua, and taught successively in
   Bologna, Pavia, Siena, Florence and Perugia. Paul II. appointed him
   cardinal. In the conclave strong support is said to have come to him
   through his notorious nephew, Peter Riario, who was active in
   conducting his canvas and making substantial promises for votes.

   The effort to interest the princes in the Turkish crusade was renewed,
   but soon abandoned. Cardinals were despatched to the various courts of
   Europe, Bessarion to France, Marco Barbo to Germany, and Borgia to
   Spain, but only to find these governments preoccupied with other
   concerns or ill-disposed to the enterprise. In 1472, a papal fleet of
   18 galleys actually set sail, with banners blessed by the pope in St.
   Peter's, and under the command of Cardinal Caraffa. It was met at
   Rhodes by 30 ships from Naples and 36 from Venice and, after some
   plundering exploits, returned with 25 Turkish prisoners of war and 12
   camels,--trophies enough to arouse the curiosity of the Romans. Moneys
   realized from some of Paul II.'s gems had been employed to meet the
   expenditure.

   Sixtus' relatives became the leading figures in Rome, and in wealth and
   pomp they soon rivalled or eclipsed the old Roman families and the
   older members of the sacred college. Sixtus was blessed or burdened
   with 16 nephews and grandnephews. All that was in his power to do, he
   did, to give them a good time and to establish them in affluence and
   honor all their days. The Sienese had their day under Pius II., and now
   it was the turn of the Ligurians. The pontiff's two brothers and three,
   if not four, sisters, as well as all their progeny, had to be taken
   care of. The excuse made for Calixtus III. cannot be made for this
   indulgent uncle, that he was approaching his dotage. Sixtus was only 56
   when he reached the tiara. And desperate is the suggestion that the
   unfitness or unwillingness of the Roman nobility to give the pope
   proper support made it necessary for him to raise up another and a
   complacent aristocracy. [762]

   Sixtus deemed no less than five of his nephews and a grandnephew
   deserving of the red hat, and sooner or later eight of them were
   introduced into the college of cardinals. Two nephews in succession
   were appointed prefects of Rome. The nephews who achieved the rank of
   cardinals were Pietro Riario at 25, and Julian della Rovere at 28, in
   1471, both Franciscan monks; Jerome Basso and Christopher Rovere, in
   1477; Dominico Rovere, Christopher's brother, in 1478; and the pope's
   grandnephew, Raphael Sansoni, at the age of 17, in 1477. The two
   nephews made prefects of Rome were Julian's brother Lionardo, who died
   in 1475, and his brother Giovanni, d. 1501. Lionardo was married by his
   uncle to the illegitimate daughter of Ferrante, king of Naples. [763]

   Upon Peter Riario and Julian Rovere he heaped benefice after benefice.
   Julian, a man of rare ability, afterwards made pope under the name of
   Julius II., was appointed archbishop of Avignon and then of Bologna,
   bishop of Lausanne, Constance, Viviers, Ostia and Velletri, and placed
   at the head of several abbeys. Riario, who, according to popular
   hearsay, was the pope's own child, was bishop of Spoleto, Seville and
   Valencia, Patriarch of Constantinople, and recipient of other rich
   places, until his income amounted to 60,000 florins or about 2,500,000
   francs. He went about with a retinue of 100 horsemen. His expenditures
   were lavish and his estate royal. His mistresses, whom he did not
   attempt to conceal, were dressed in elegant fabrics, and one of them
   wore slippers embroidered with pearls. Dominico received one after the
   other the bishoprics of Corneto, Tarentaise, Geneva and Turin.

   The visit of Leonora, the daughter of Ferrante, in Rome in 1473, while
   on her way to Ferrara to meet her husband, Hercules of Este, was
   perhaps the most splendid occasion the city had witnessed since the
   first visit of Frederick III. It furnished Riario an opportunity for
   the display of a magnificent hospitality. On Whitsunday, the Neapolitan
   princess was conducted by two cardinals to St. Peter's, where she heard
   mass said by the pope and then at high-noon witnessed the miracle play
   of Susanna and the Elders, acted by Florentine players. The next
   evening she sat down to a banquet which lasted 3 hours and combined all
   the skill which decorators and cooks could apply. The soft divans and
   costly curtainings, the silk costumes of the servants and the rich
   courses are described in detail by contemporary writers. In
   anticipation of modern electrical fans, 3 bellows were used to cool and
   freshen the atmosphere. In such things, remarks Infessura, the
   treasures of the Church were squandered. [764]

   In 1474, on the death of Peter Riario, a victim of his excesses and
   aged only 28, [765] his brother Jerome, a layman, came into supreme
   favor. Sixtus was ready to put all the possessions of the papal see at
   his disposal and, on his account, he became involved in feuds with
   Florence and Venice. He purchased for this favorite Imola, at a cost of
   40,000 ducats, and married him to the illegitimate daughter of the duke
   of Milan, Catherine Sforza. The purchase of Imola was resented by
   Florence, but Sixtus did not hesitate to further antagonize the
   republic and the Medici. The Medici had established a branch
   banking-house in Rome and become the papal bankers. Sixtus chose to
   affront the family by patronizing the Pazzi, a rival banking-firm. At
   the death of Philip de'Medici, archbishop of Pisa, in 1474, Salviati
   was appointed his successor against the protest of the Medici. Finally,
   Julian de' Medici was denied the cardinalship. These events marked the
   stages in the progress of the rupture between the papacy and Florence.
   Lorenzo, called the Magnificent, and his brother Julian represented the
   family which the fiscal talents of Cosmo de'Medici had founded. In his
   readiness to support the ambitions of his nephew, Jerome Riario, the
   pope seemed willing to go to any length of violence. A conspiracy was
   directed against Lorenzo's life, in which Jerome was the chief
   actor,--one of the most cold-blooded conspiracies of history. The pope
   was conversant with the plot and talked it over with its chief agent,
   Montesecco and, though he may not have consented to murder, which
   Jerome and the Pazzi had included in their plan, he fully approved of
   the plot to seize Lorenzo's person and overthrow the republic. [766]

   The terrible tragedy was enacted in the cathedral of Florence. When
   Montesecco, a captain of the papal mercenaries, hired to carry out the
   plot, shrank from committing sacrilege by shedding blood in the church
   of God, its execution was intrusted to two priests, Antonio Maffei da
   Volterra and Stefano of Bagnorea, the former a papal secretary. While
   the host was being elevated, Julian de'Medici, who was inside the
   choir, was struck with one dagger after another and fell dead. Lorenzo
   barely escaped. As he was entering the sanctuary, he was struck by
   Maffei and slightly wounded, and made a shield of his arm by winding
   his mantle around it, and escaped with friends to the sacristy, which
   was barred against the assassins. The bloody deed took place April 26,
   1478.

   The city proved true to the family which had shed so much lustre upon
   it, and quick revenge was taken upon the agents of the conspiracy.
   Archbishop Salviati, his brother, Francesco de' Pazzi and others were
   hung from the signoria windows. [767] The two priests were executed
   after having their ears and noses cut off. Montesecco was beheaded.
   Among those who witnessed the scene in the cathedral was the young
   cardinal, Raphael, the pope's grandnephew, and without having any
   previous knowledge of the plot. His face, it was said, turned to an
   ashen pallor, which in after years he never completely threw off.

   With intrepid resolution, Sixtus resented the death of his archbishop
   and the indignity done a cardinal in the imprisonment of Raphael as an
   accomplice. He hurled the interdict at the city, branding Lorenzo as
   the son of iniquity and the ward of perdition,--iniquitatis filius et
   perditionis alumnus,--and entered into an alliance with Naples against
   it. Louis XI. of France and Venice and other Italian states espoused
   the cause of Florence. Pushed to desperation, Lorenzo went to Naples
   and made such an impression on Ferrante that he changed his attitude
   and joined an alliance with Florence. The pope was checkmated. The
   seizure of Otranto on Italian soil by the Turks, in 1480, called
   attention away from the feud to the imminent danger threatening all
   Italy. In December of that year, Sixtus absolved Florence, and the
   legates of the city were received in front of St. Peter's and touched
   with the rod in token of forgiveness. Six months later, May 26, 1481,
   Rome received the news of the death of Mohammed II., which Sixtus
   celebrated by special services in the church, Maria del Popolo, [768]
   and the Turks abandoned the Italian coast.

   Again, in the interest of his nephew, Jerome, Sixtus took Forli,
   thereby giving offence to Ferrara. He joined Venice in a war against
   that city, and all Italy became involved. Later, the warlike pontiff
   again saw his league broken up and Venice and Ferrara making peace,
   irrespective of his counsels. He vented his mortification by putting
   the queen of the Adriatic under the interdict.

   In Rome, the bloody pope fanned the feud between the Colonna and the
   Orsini, and almost succeeded in blotting out the name of the Colonna by
   assassination and judicial murder.

   Sixtus has the distinction of having extended the efficacy of
   indulgences to souls in purgatory. He was most zealous in distributing
   briefs of indulgence. [769] The Spanish Inquisition received his solemn
   sanction in 1478. Himself a Franciscan, he augmented the privileges of
   the Franciscan order in a bull which that order calls its great
   ocean--mare magnum. He canonized the official biographer of Francis
   d'Assisi, Bonaventura.

   He issued two bulls with reference to the worship of Mary and the
   doctrine of the immaculate conception, but he declared her sinlessness
   from the instant of conception a matter undecided by the Roman Church
   and the Apostolic see--nondum ab ecclesia romana et apostolica sede
   decisum. [770] In all matters of ritual and outward religion, he was of
   all men most punctilious. The chronicler, Volterra, abounds in notices
   of his acts of devotion. Asa patron of art, his name has a high place.
   He supported Platina with four assistants in cataloguing the archives
   of the Vatican in three volumes.

   Such was Sixtus IV., the unblushing promoter of the interests of his
   relatives, many of them as worthless as they were insolent, the
   disturber of the peace of Italy, revengeful, and yet the liberal patron
   of the arts. The enlightened diarist of Rome, Infessura, [771] calls
   the day of the pontiff's decease that most happy day, the day on which
   God liberated Christendom from the hand of an impious and iniquitous
   ruler, who had before him no fear of God nor love of the Christian
   world nor any charity whatsoever, but was actuated by avarice, the love
   of vain show and pomp, most cruel and given to sodomy. [772]

   During his reign, were born in obscure places in Saxony and Switzerland
   two men who were to strike a mighty blow at the papal rule, themselves
   also of peasant lineage and the coming leaders of the new spiritual
   movement.

   bitterly hostile. Burchard, I. 10 sqq., gives a very detailed account
   of Sixtus' obsequies. He spoke from observation as one of the masters
   of ceremonies. Pastor makes a bold effort to rescue Sixtus from most of
   the charges made against his character by Infessura.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 53. Innocent VIII. 1484-1492.

   Under Innocent VIII. matters in Rome were, if anything, worse than
   under his predecessor, Sixtus IV. Innocent was an easy-going man
   without ideals, incapable of conceiving or carrying out high plans. He
   was chiefly notable for his open avowal of an illegitimate family and
   his bull against witchcraft.

   At Sixtus' death, wild confusion reigned in Rome. Nobles and cardinals
   barricaded their residences. Houses were pillaged. The mob held
   carnival on the streets. The palace of Jerome Riario was sacked. Relief
   was had by an agreement between the rival families of the Orsini and
   Colonna to withdraw from the city for a month and Jerome's renunciation
   of the castle of S. Angelo, which his wife had defended, for 4,000
   ducats. Not till then did the cardinals feel themselves justified in
   meeting for the election of a new pontiff.

   The conclaves of 1484 and 1492 have been pronounced by high catholic
   authority among the "saddest in the history of the papacy." [773] Into
   the conclave of 1484, 25 cardinals entered, 21 of them Italians. Our
   chief account is from the hand of the diarist, Burchard, who was
   present as one of the officials.

   His description goes into the smallest details. A protocol was again
   adopted, which every cardinal promised in a solemn formula to observe,
   if elected pope. Its first stipulation was that 100 ducats should be
   paid monthly to members of the sacred college, whose yearly income from
   benefices might not reach the sum of 4,000 ducats (about 200,000 francs
   in our present money). Then followed provisions for the continuance of
   the crusade against the Turks, the reform of the Roman curia in head
   and members, the appointment of no cardinal under 30 for any cause
   whatever, the advancement of not more than a single relative of the
   reigning pontiff to the sacred college and the restriction of its
   membership to 24. [774]

   Rodrigo Borgia fully counted upon being elected and, in expectation of
   that event, had barricaded his palace against being looted. Large
   bribes, even to the gift of his palace, were offered by him for the
   coveted prize of the papacy. Cardinal Barbo had 10 votes and, when it
   seemed likely that he would be the successful candidate, Julian Rovere
   and Borgia, renouncing their aspirations, combined their forces, and
   during the night, went from cell to cell, securing by promises of
   benefices and money the votes of all but six of the cardinals.
   According to Burchard, the pope about to be elected sat up all night
   signing promises. The next morning the two cardinals aroused the six
   whom they had not disturbed, exclaiming, "Come, let us make a pope."
   "Who?" they said. "Cardinal Cibo." "How is that?" they asked. "While
   you were drowsy with sleep, we gathered all the votes except yours,"
   was the reply.

   The new pope, Lorenzo Cibo, born in Genoa, 1432, had been made cardinal
   by Sixtus IV., 1473. During his rule, peace was maintained with the
   courts of Italy, but in Rome clerical dissipation, curial venality and
   general lawlessness were rampant. "In darkness Innocent was elected, in
   darkness he lives, and in darkness he will die," said the general of
   the Augustinians. [775] Women were carried off in the night. The
   murdered were found in the streets in the morning. Crimes, before their
   commission, were compounded for money. Even the churches were pilfered.
   A piece of the true cross was stolen from S. Maria in Trastavere. The
   wood was reported found in a vineyard, but without its silver frame.
   When the vice-chancellor, Borgia, was asked why the laws were not
   enforced, he replied, "God desires not the death of a sinner, but
   rather that he should pay and live." [776] The favorite of Sixtus IV.,
   Jerome Riario, was murdered in 1488. His widow, the brave and masculine
   Catherine Sforza, who was pregnant at the time, defended his castle at
   Forli and defied the papal forces besieging it, declaring that, if they
   put her children to death who were with her, she yet had one left at
   Imola and the unborn child in her womb. The duke of Milan, her
   relative, rescued her and put the besiegers to flight.

   All ecclesiastical offices were set for sale. How could it be
   otherwise, when the papal tiara itself was within the reach of the
   highest bidder? [777] The appointment of 18 new papal secretaries
   brought 62,400 ducats into the papal treasury. The bulls creating the
   offices expressly declared the aim to be to secure funds. 52 persons
   were appointed to seal the papal bulls, called plumbatores, from the
   leaden ball or seal they used, and the price of the position was fixed
   at 2,500 ducats. Even the office of librarian in the Vatican was sold,
   and the papal tiara was put in pawn. In a time of universal traffic in
   ecclesiastical offices, it is not surprising that the fabrication of
   papal documents was turned into a business. Two papal notaries
   confessed to having issued 50 such documents in two years, and in spite
   of the pleas of their friends were hung and burnt, 1489. [778]

   Innocent's children were not persons of marked traits, or given to
   ambitious intrigues. Common rumor gave their number as 16, all of them
   children by married women. [779] Franceschetto and Theorina seem to
   have been born before the father entered the priesthood.
   Franceschetto's marriage to Maddalena, a daughter of Lorenzo the
   Magnificent, was celebrated in the Vatican, Jan. 20, 1488. Ten months
   later, the pope's granddaughter, Peretta, child of Theorina, was also
   married in the Vatican to the marquis of Finale. The pontiff sat with
   the ladies at the table, a thing contrary to all the accepted
   proprieties. In 1492, another grandchild, also a daughter of Theorina,
   Battistana, was married to duke Louis of Aragon. [780]

   The statement of Infessura is difficult to believe, although it is made
   at length, that Innocent issued a decree permitting concubinage in Rome
   both to clergy and laity. The prohibition of concubinage was declared
   prejudicial to the divine law and the honor of the clergy, as almost
   all the clergy, from the highest to the lowest, had concubines, or
   mistresses. According to the Roman diarist, there were 6,800 listed
   public courtezans in Rome besides those whose names were not recorded.
   [781] To say the least, the statement points to the low condition of
   clerical morals in the holy city and the slight regard paid to the
   legislation of Gregory VII. Infessura was in position to know what was
   transpiring in Rome.

   What could be expected where the morals of the supreme pontiff and the
   sacred senate were so loose? The lives of many of the cardinals were
   notoriously scandalous. Their palaces were furnished with princely
   splendor and filled with scores of servants. Their example led the
   fashions in extravagance in dress and sumptuous banquetings. They had
   their stables, kennels and falcons. Cardinal Sforza, whose yearly
   income is reported to have been 30,000 ducats, or 1,500,000 francs,
   present money, excelled in the chase. Cardinal Julian made sport of
   celibacy, and had three daughters. Cardinal Borgia, the acknowledged
   leader in all gayeties, was known far and wide by his children, who
   were prominent on every occasion of display and conviviality. The
   passion for gaming ran high in the princely establishments. Cardinal
   Raphael won 8,000 ducats at play from Cardinal Balue who, however, in
   spite of such losses, left a fortune of 100,000 ducats. This
   grandnephew of Sixtus IV. was a famous player, and in a single night
   won from Innocent's son, Franceschetto, 14,000 ducats. The son
   complained to his father, who ordered the fortunate winner to restore
   the night's gains. But the gay prince of the church excused himself by
   stating that the money had already been paid out upon the new palace he
   was engaged in erecting.

   The only relative whom Innocent promoted to the sacred college was his
   illegitimate brother's son, Lorenzo Cibo. The appointment best known to
   posterity was that of Giovanni de' Medici, son of Lorenzo the
   Magnificent, afterwards Leo X.

   Another appointment, that of D'Aubusson, was associated with the case
   of the Mohammedan prince, Djem. This incident in the annals of the
   papacy would seem incredible, if it were not true. A writer of romance
   could hardly have invented an episode more grotesque. At the death of
   Mohammed II., his son, Djem, was defeated in his struggle for the
   succession by his brother Bajazet, and fled to Rhodes for protection.
   The Knights of St. John were willing to hold the distinguished fugitive
   as prisoner, upon the promise of 45,000 ducats a year from the sultan.
   For safety's sake, Djem was removed to one of the Hospitaller houses in
   France. Hungary, Naples, Venice, France and the pope,--all put in a
   claim for him. Such competition to pay honor to an infidel prince had
   never before been heard of in Christendom. The pope won by making
   valuable ecclesiastical concessions to the French king, among them the
   bestowal of the red hat on D'Aubusson.

   The matter being thus amicably adjusted, Djem was conducted to Rome,
   where he was received with impressive ceremonies by the cardinals and
   city officials. His person was regarded as of more value than the
   knowledge of the East brought by Marco Polo had been in its day, and
   the reception of the Mohammedan prince created more interest than the
   return of Columbus from his first journey to the West. Djem was
   escorted through the streets by the pope's son, and rode a white horse
   sent him by the pope. The ambassador of the sultan of Egypt, then in
   Rome, had gone out to meet him, and shed tears as he kissed his feet
   and the feet of his horse. The popes had not shrunk from entering into
   alliances with Oriental powers to secure the overthrow of Mohammed II.
   and his dynasty. Djem, or the Grand Turk, as he was called, was
   welcomed by the pope surrounded by his cardinals. The proud descendant
   of Eastern monarchs, however, refused to kiss the supreme pontiff's
   foot, but made some concession by kissing his shoulder. He was
   represented as short and stout, with an aquiline nose, and a single
   good eye, given at times inordinately to drink, though a man of some
   intellectual culture. He was reported to have put four men to death
   with his own hand. But Djem was a dignitary who signified too much to
   be cast aside for such offences. Innocent assigned him to elegantly
   furnished apartments in the Vatican, and thus the strange spectacle was
   afforded of the earthly head of Christendom acting as the host of one
   of the chief living representatives of the faith of Islam, which had
   almost crushed out the Christian churches of the East and usurped the
   throne on the Bosphorus.

   Bajazet was willing to pay the pope 40,000 ducats for the hospitality
   extended to his rival brother, and delegations came from him to Rome to
   arrange the details of the bargain. The report ran that attempts were
   made by the sultan to poison both his brother and the pope by
   contaminating the wells of the Vatican. When the ambassador brought
   from Constantinople the delayed payment of three years, 120,000 ducats,
   Djem insisted that the Turk's clothes should be removed and his skin be
   rubbed down with a towel, and that he should lick the letter "on every
   side," as proof that he did not also carry poison. [782] Djem survived
   his first papal entertainer, Innocent VIII., three years, and figured
   prominently in public functions in the reign of Alexander VI. He died
   1495, still a captive.

   Another curious instance was given in Innocent's reign of the hold
   open-mouthed superstition had in the reception given to the holy lance.
   This pretended instrument, with which Longinus pierced the Saviour's
   side and which was found during the Crusades by the monk Barthélemy at
   Antioch, was already claimed by two cities, Nürnberg and Paris. The
   relic made a greater draft upon the credulity of the age than St.
   Andrew's head. The latter was the gift of a Christian prince, howbeit
   an adherent of the schismatic Greek Church; the lance came from a Turk,
   Sultan Bajazet.

   Some question arose among the cardinals whether it would not be
   judicious to stay the acceptance of the gift till the claims of the
   lance in Nürnberg had been investigated. But the pope's piety, such as
   it was, would not allow a question of that sort to interfere. An
   archbishop and a bishop were despatched to Ancona to receive the iron
   fragment, for only the head of the lance was extant. It was conducted
   from the city gates by the cardinals to St. Peter's, and after mass the
   pope gave his blessing. The day of the reception happened to be a fast,
   but, at the suggestion of one of the cardinals, some of the fountains
   along the streets, where the procession was appointed to go, were made
   to throw out wine to slake the thirst of the populace. After a solemn
   service in S. Maria del Popolo, on Ascension Day, 1492, the Turkish
   present, encased in a receptacle of crystal and gold, was placed near
   the handkerchief of St. Veronica in St. Peter's. [783]

   The two great stains upon the pontificate of Innocent VIII., the
   crusade he called to exterminate the Waldenses, 1487, and his bull
   directed against the witches of Germany, 1484, which inaugurated two
   horrible dramas of cruelty, have treatment in another place.

   Innocent was happy in being permitted to join with Europe in rejoicings
   over the expulsion of the last of the Moors from Granada, 1492. Masses
   were said in Rome, and a sermon preached in the pontiff's presence in
   celebration of the memorable event. [784] With characteristic national
   gallantry, Cardinal Borgia showed his appreciation by instituting a
   bull-fight in which five bulls were killed, the first but not the last
   spectacle of the kind seen in the papal city. In his last sickness,
   Innocent was fed by a woman's milk. [785] Several years before, when he
   was thought to be dying, the cardinals found 1,200,000 ducats in his
   drawers and chests. They now granted his request that 48,000 ducats
   should be taken from his fortune and distributed among his relatives.

   § 54. Pope Alexander VI--Borgia. 1492-1503.

   The pontificate of Alexander VI., which coincides with the closing
   years of the 15th century and the opening of the 16th, may be compared
   with the pontificate of Boniface VIII., which witnessed the passage
   from the 13th to the 14th centuries. Boniface marked the opening act in
   the decline of the papal power introduced by the king of France. Under
   Alexander, when the French again entered actively into the affairs of
   Italy, even to seizing Rome, the papacy passed into its deepest moral
   humiliation since the days of the pornocracy in the 10th century.

   Alexander VI., whom we have before known as Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia,
   has the notorious distinction of being the most corrupt of the popes of
   the Renaissance period. Even in the judgment of Catholic historians,
   his dissoluteness knew no restraint and his readiness to abase the
   papacy for his own personal ends, no bounds. [786] His intellectual
   force, if used aright, might have made his pontificate one of the most
   brilliant in the annals of the Apostolic see. The time was ripe. The
   conditions offered the opportunity if ever period did. But moral
   principle was wanting. Had Dante lived again, he would have written
   that Alexander VI. made a greater refusal than the hermit pope,
   Coelestine V., and deserved a darker doom than the simoniac pope,
   Boniface VIII.

   At Innocent VIII.'s death, 23 cardinals entered into the conclave which
   met in the Sistine chapel. Borgia and Julian Rovere were the leading
   candidates. They were rivals, and had been candidates for the papal
   chair before. Everything was to be staked on success in the pending
   election. Openly and without a blush, ecclesiastical offices and money
   were offered as the price of the spiritual crown of Christendom. Julian
   was supported by the king of France, who deposited 200,000 ducats in a
   Roman bank and 100,000 more in Genoa to secure his election. If Borgia
   could not outbid him he was, at least, the more shrewd in his
   manipulations. There were only five cardinals, including Julian, who
   took nothing. The other members of the sacred college had their price.
   Monticelli and Soriano were given to Cardinal Orsini and also the see
   of Cartagena, and the legation to the March; the abbey of Subiaco and
   its fortresses to Colonna; Civita Castellana and the see of Majorca to
   Savelli; Nepi to Sclafetanus; the see of Porto to Michïel; and rich
   benefices to other cardinals. Four mules laden with gold were conducted
   to the palace of Ascanio Sforza, who also received Rodrigo's splendid
   palace and the vice-chancellorship. Even the patriarch of Venice, whose
   high age--for he had reached 95--might have been expected to lift him
   above the seduction of filthy lucre, accepted 5,000 ducats. Infessura
   caustically remarks that Borgia distributed all his goods among the
   poor. [787]

   The ceremonies of coronation were on a scale which appeared to the
   contemporaries unparalleled in the history of such occasions. A figure
   of a bull, the emblem of the Borgias, was erected near the Palazzo di
   S. Marco on the line of the procession, from whose eyes, nostrils and
   mouth poured forth water, and from the forehead wine. Rodrigo was 61
   years of age, had been cardinal for 37 years, having received that
   dignity when he was 25. His fond uncle, Calixtus III., had made him
   archbishop of Valencia, heaped upon him ecclesiastical offices,
   including the vice-chancellorship, and made him the heir of his
   personal possessions. His palace was noted for the splendor of its
   tapestries and carpets and its vessels of gold and silver. [788] The
   new pope possessed conspicuous personal attractions. He was tall and
   well-formed, and his manners so taking that a contemporary, Gasparino
   of Verona, speaks of his drawing women to himself more potently than
   the magnet attracts iron. [789] The reproof which his gallantries of
   other days called forth from Pius II. at Siena has already been
   referred to.

   The pre-eminent features of Alexander's career, as the supreme pontiff
   of Christendom, were his dissolute habits and his extravagant passion
   to exalt the worldly fortunes of his children. In these two respects he
   seemed to be destitute at once of all regard for the solemnity of his
   office and of common conscience. A third feature was the entry of
   Charles VIII. and the French into Italy and Rome. During his
   pontificate two events occurred whose world-wide significance was
   independent of the occupant of the papal throne,--the one geographical,
   the other religious,--the discovery of America and the execution of the
   Florentine preacher, Savonarola. As in the reign of Calixtus III., so
   now Spaniards flocked to Rome, and the Milanese ambassador wrote that
   ten papacies would not have been able to satisfy their greed for
   official recognition. In spite of a protocol adopted in the conclave, a
   month did not pass before Alexander appointed his nephew, Juan of
   Borgia, cardinal, and in the next years he admitted four more members
   of the Borgia family to the sacred college, including his infamous son,
   Caesar Borgia, at the age of 18. [790]

   Alexander's household and progeny call for treatment first. It soon
   became evident that the supreme passion of his pontificate was to
   advance the fortunes of his children. [791] His parental relations were
   not merely the subject of rumor; they are vouched for by irresistible
   documentary proof.

   Alexander was the acknowledged father of five children by Vanozza de
   Cataneis: Pedro Luis, Juan, Caesar, Lucretia, Joffré and, perhaps,
   Pedro Ludovico. The briefs issued by Sixtus IV. legitimating Caesar and
   Ludovico are still extant. [792] Two bulls were issued by Alexander
   himself in 1493, bearing on Caesar's parentage. The first, declaring
   him to be the son of Vanozza by a former husband, was intended to
   remove the objections the sacred college naturally felt in admitting to
   its number one of uncertain birth. In the second, Alexander announced
   him to be his own son. [793] Tiring of Vanozza, who was 11 years his
   junior, Alexander put her aside and saw that she was married
   successively to three husbands, himself arranging for the first
   relationship and making provision for the second and the third. [794]
   In her later correspondence with Lucretia she signed herself, thy happy
   and unhappy mother--la felice ed infelice matre.

   These were not the only children Alexander acknowledged. His daughters
   Girolama and Isabella were married 1482 and 1483. [795] Another
   daughter, Laura, by Julia Farnese, born in 1492, he acknowledged as his
   own child, and in 1501 the pope formally legitimated, as his own son,
   Juan, by a Roman woman. In a first bull he called the boy Caesar's, but
   in a second he recognized him as his own offspring. [796]

   Among Alexander's mistresses, after he became pope, the most famous was
   cardinal Farnese's sister, Julia Farnese, called for her beauty, La
   Bella. Infessura repeatedly refers to her as Alexander's concubine. Her
   legal husband was appeased by the gift of castles.

   The gayeties, escapades, marriages, worldly distinctions and crimes of
   these children would have furnished daily material for paragraphs of a
   nature to satisfy the most sensational modern taste. Don Pedro Luis,
   Alexander's eldest son, and his three older brothers began their public
   careers in the service of the Spanish king, Ferdinand, who admitted
   them to the ranks of the higher nobility and sold Gandia, with the
   title of duke, to Don Pedro. This gallant young Borgia died in 1491 at
   the age of 30, on the eve of his journey from Rome to Spain to marry
   Ferdinand's cousin. His brother, Don Juan, fell heir to the estate and
   title of Gandia and was married with princely splendor in Barcelona to
   the princess to whom Don Pedro had been betrothed.

   Alexander's son, Caesar Borgia was as bad as his ambition was insolent.
   The annals of Rome and of the Vatican for more than a decade are filled
   with his impiety, his intrigues and his crimes. At the age of six, he
   was declared eligible for ordination. He was made protonotary and
   bishop of Pampeluna by Innocent VIII. At his father's election he
   hurried from Pisa, where he was studying, and on the day of his
   father's coronation was appointed archbishop of Valencia. He was then
   sixteen.

   Don Joffré was married, at 13, to a daughter of Alfonso of Naples and
   was made prince of Squillace.

   The personal fortunes of Alexander's daughter, Lucretia, constitute one
   of the notorious and tragic episodes of the 15th century.

   The most serious foreign issue in Alexander's reign was the invasion of
   Charles VIII., king of France. The introductory act in what seemed
   likely to be the complete transformation of Italy was the sale of
   Cervetri and Anguillara to Virginius Orsini for 40,000 ducats by
   Franceschetto, the son of Innocent VIII. This papal scion was contented
   with a life of ease and retired to Florence. The transfer of these two
   estates was treated by the Sforza as disturbing the balance of power in
   the peninsula, and Ludovico and Ascanio Sforza pressed Alexander to
   check the influence of Ferrante, king of Naples, who was the supporter
   of the Orsini. Ferrante, a shrewd politician, by ministering to
   Alexander's passion to advance his children's fortunes, won him from
   the alliance with the Sforza. He promised to the pope's son, Joffré,
   Donna Sancia, a mere child, in marriage. Ludovico Sforza, ready to
   resort to any measure likely to promote his own personal ambition,
   invited Charles VIII. to enter Italy and make good his claim to the
   crown of Naples on the ground of the former Angevin possession. He also
   applauded the French king's announced purpose to reduce Constantinople
   once more to Christian dominion.

   On Ferrante's death, 1494, Alfonso II. was crowned king of Naples by
   Alexander's nephew, Cardinal Juan Borgia. Charles, then only 22, was
   short, deformed, with an aquiline nose and an inordinately big head. He
   set out for Italy at the head of a splendid army of 40,000 men,
   equipped with the latest inventions in artillery. Julian Rovere, who
   had resisted Alexander's policy and fled to Avignon, joined with other
   disaffected cardinals in supporting the French and accompanying the
   French army. Charles' march through Northern Italy was a series of easy
   and almost bloodless triumphs. Milan threw open its gates to Charles.
   So did Pisa. Before entering Florence, the king was met by Savonarola,
   who regarded him as the messenger appointed by God to rescue Italy from
   her godless condition. Rome was helpless. Alexander's ambassadors, sent
   to treat with the invader, were either denied audience or denied
   satisfaction. In his desperation, the pope resorted to the Turkish
   sultan, Bajazet, for aid. The correspondence that passed between the
   supreme ruler of Christendom and the leading sovereign of the
   Mohammedan world was rescued from oblivion by the capture of its
   bearer, George Busardo. [797] 40,000 ducats were found on Busardo's
   person, a payment sent by Bajazet to Alexander for Djem's safe-keeping.
   Alexander had indicated to the sultan that it was Charles' aim to carry
   Djem off to France and then use him as the admiral of a fleet for the
   capture of Constantinople. In reply, Bajazet suggested that such an
   issue would result in even greater damage to the pope than to himself.
   His papal friend, whom he addressed as his Gloriosity--gloriositas,
   might be pleased to lift the said prisoner, Djem, out of the troubles
   of this present world and transfer his soul into another, where he
   would enjoy more quiet. [798] For performing such a service, he stood
   ready to give him the sum of 300,000 ducats, which, as he suggested,
   the pope might use in purchasing princedoms for his children.

   On the last day of 1494, the French army entered the holy city,
   dragging with it 36 bronze cannon. Such military discipline and
   equipment the Romans had not seen, and they looked on with awe and
   admiration. To the king's demand that the castle of S. Angelo be
   surrendered, Alexander sent a refusal declaring that, if the fortress
   were attacked, he would take his position on the walls surrounded with
   the most sacred relics in Rome. Cardinals Julian Rovere, Sforza,
   Savelli and Colonna, who had ridden into the city with the French
   troops, urged the king to call a council and depose Alexander for
   simony. But when it came to the manipulation of men, Alexander was more
   than a match for his enemies. Charles had no desire to humiliate the
   pope, except so far as it might be necessary for the accomplishment of
   his designs upon Naples. A pact was arranged, which included the
   delivery of Djem to the French and the promise that Caesar Borgia
   should accompany the French troops to Naples as papal legate. In the
   meantime the French soldiery had sacked the city, even to Vanozza's
   house. Henceforth the king occupied quarters in the Vatican, and the
   disaffected cardinals, with the exception of Julian, were reconciled to
   the pope.

   On his march to Naples, which began Jan. 25, 1495, Charles took Djem
   with him. That individual passed out of the gates of Rome, riding at
   the side of Caesar. These two personages, the Turkish pretender and the
   pontiff's son, had been on terms of familiarity, and often rode on
   horseback together. Within a month after leaving Rome, and before
   reaching Naples, the Oriental died. The capital of Southern Italy was
   an easy prize for the invaders. Caesar had been able to make his escape
   from the French camp. His son's shrewdness and good luck afforded
   Alexander as much pleasure as did the opportunity of joining the king
   of Spain and the cities of Northern Italy in an alliance against
   Charles. In 1496, the alliance was strengthened by the accession of
   Henry VII. of England. After abandoning himself for several months to
   the pleasures of the Neapolitan capital, the French king retraced his
   course and, after the battle of Fornuovo, July 6, 1495, evacuated
   Italy. Alexander had evaded him by retiring from Rome, and sent after
   the retreating king a message to return to his proper dominions on pain
   of excommunication. The summons neither hastened the departure of the
   French nor prevented them from returning to the peninsula again in a
   few years. [799]

   The misfortunes and scandals of the papal household were not
   interrupted by the French invasion, and continued after it. In the
   summer of 1497, occurred the mysterious murder of Alexander's son, the
   duke of Gandia, then 24 years old. It was only a sample of the crimes
   being perpetrated in Rome. The duke had supped with Caesar, his
   brother, and Cardinal Juan Borgia at the residence of Vanozza. The
   supper being over, the two brothers rode together as far as the palace
   of Cardinal Sforza. There they separated, the duke going, as he said,
   on some private business, and accompanied by a masked man who had been
   much with him for a month past. The next day, Alexander waited for his
   son in vain. In the evening, unable to bear the suspense longer, he
   instituted an investigation. The man in the mask had been found
   mortally wounded. A charcoal-dealer deposed that, after midnight, he
   had seen several men coming to the brink of the river, one of them on a
   white horse, over the back of which was thrown a dead man. They backed
   the horse and pitched the body into the water. The pope was
   inconsolable with grief, and remained without food from Thursday to
   Sunday. He had recently made his son lord of the papal patrimony and of
   Viterbo, standard-bearer of the church and duke of Benevento. In
   reporting the loss to the consistory of cardinals, the father declared
   that he loved Don Juan more than anything in the world, and that if he
   had seven papacies he would give them all to restore his son's life.

   The origin of the murder was a mystery. Different persons were picked
   out as the perpetrators. It was surmised that the deed was committed by
   some lover who had been abused by the gay duke. Suspicion also fastened
   on Ascanio Sforza, the only cardinal who did not attend the consistory.
   But gradually the conviction prevailed that the murderer was no other
   than Caesar Borgia himself, and the Italian historian, Guicciardini,
   three years later adopted the explanation of fratricide. Caesar, it was
   rumored, was jealous of the place the duke of Gandia held in his
   father's affections, and hankered after the worldly honors which had
   been heaped upon him.

   When the charcoal-dealer was asked why he did not at once report the
   dark scene, he replied that such deeds were a common occurrence and he
   had witnessed a hundred like it. [800]

   In the first outburst of his grief, Alexander, moved by feelings akin
   to repentance, appointed a commission of six cardinals to bring in
   proposals for the reformation of the curia and the Church. His
   reforming ardor was, however, soon spent, and the proposals, when
   offered, were set aside as derogatory to the papal prerogative. For the
   next two years, the marriages and careers of his children, Caesar and
   Lucretia, were treated as if they were the chief concern of
   Christendom.

   Lucretia, born in 1480, had already been twice betrothed to Spaniards,
   when the father was elected pope and sought for her a higher alliance.
   In 1493, she was married to John Sforza, lord of Pesaro, a man of
   illegitimate birth. The young princess was assigned a palace of her own
   near the Vatican, where Julia Farnese ruled as her father's mistress.
   It was a gay life she lived, as the centre of the young matrons of
   Rome. Accompanied by a hundred of them at a time, she rode to church.
   She was pronounced by the master of ceremonies of the papal chapel most
   fair, of a bright disposition, and given to fun and laughter. [801] The
   charges of incest with her own father and brother Caesar made against
   her on the streets of the papal city, in the messages of ambassadors
   and by the historian, Guicciardini, seem too shocking to be believed,
   and have been set aside by Gregorovius, the most brilliant modern
   authority for her life. The distinguished character of her last
   marriage and the domestic peace and happiness by which it was marked
   seem to be sufficient to discredit the damaging accusations.

   The marriage with the lord of Pesaro was celebrated in the Vatican,
   after a sermon had been preached by the bishop of Concordia. Among the
   guests were 11 cardinals and 150 Roman ladies. The entertainment lasted
   till 5 in the morning. There was dancing, and obscene comedies were
   performed, with Alexander and the cardinals looking on. And all this,
   exclaims a contemporary," to the honor and praise of Almighty God and
   the Roman church!" [802]

   After spending some time with her husband on his estate, Lucretia was
   divorced from him on the charge of his impotency, the divorce being
   passed upon by a commission of cardinals. After spending a short time
   in a convent, the princess was married to Don Alfonso, duke of
   Besiglia, the bastard son of Alfonso II. of Naples. The Vatican again
   witnessed the nuptial ceremony, but the marriage was, before many
   months, to be brought to a close by the duke's murder.

   In the meantime Donna Sancia, the wife of Joffré, had come to the city,
   May, 1496, and been received at the gates by cardinals, Lucretia and
   other important personages. The pope, surrounded by 11 cardinals, and
   with Lucretia on his right hand, welcomed his son and daughter-in-law
   in the Vatican. According to Burchard, the two princesses boldly
   occupied the priests' benches in St. Peter's. Later, it was said,
   Sancia's two brothers-in-law, the duke of Gandia and Caesar, quarrelled
   over her and possessed her in turn. Alexander sent her back to Naples,
   whether for this reason or not is not known. She was afterwards
   received again in Rome.

   Caesar, in spite of his yearly revenues amounting to 35,000 ducats, had
   long since grown tired of an ecclesiastical career. Bishop and
   cardinal-deacon though he was, he deposed before his fellow-cardinals
   that from the first he had been averse to orders, and received them in
   obedience to his father's wish. These words Gregorovius has pronounced
   to be perhaps the only true words the prince ever spoke. Caesar's
   request was granted by the unanimous voice of the sacred college.
   Alexander, whose policy it now was to form a lasting bond between
   France and the papacy, looked to Louis XII., successor of Charles
   VIII., for a proper introduction of his son upon a worldly career.
   [803] Louis was anxious to be divorced from his deformed and childless
   wife, Joanna of Valois, and to be united to Charles' young widow, Anne,
   who carried the dowry of Brittany with her. There were advantages to be
   gained on both sides. Dispensation was given to the king, and Caesar
   was made duke of Valentinois and promised a wife of royal line.

   The arrangements for Caesar's departure from Rome were on a grand
   scale. The richest textures were added to gold and silver vessels and
   coin, so that, when the young man departed from the city, he was
   preceded by a line of mules carrying goods worth 200,000 ducats on
   their backs. The duke's horses were shod with silver. The contemporary
   writer gives a picture of Alexander standing at the window, watching
   the cortege, in which were four cardinals, as it passed towards the
   West. The party went by way of Avignon. After some disappointment in
   not securing the princess whom Caesar had picked out, Charlotte
   d'Albret, then a young lady of sixteen, and a sister of the king of
   Navarre, was chosen. When the news of the marriage, which was
   celebrated in May, 1499, reached Rome, Alexander and the Spaniards
   illuminated their houses and the streets in honor of the proud event.
   The advancement of this abandoned man, from this time forth, engaged
   Alexander VI.'s supreme energies. The career of Caesar Borgia passes,
   if possible, into stages of deeper darkness, and the mind shrinks back
   from the awful sensuality, treachery and cruelty for which no crime was
   too revolting. Everything had to give way that stood in the hard path
   of his vulgar ambition and profligate greed. And at last his father,
   ready to sacrifice all that is sacred in religion and human life to
   secure his son's promotion, became his slave, and in fear dared not to
   offer resistance to his plans.

   The duke was soon back in Italy, accompanying the French army led by
   Louis XII. The reduction of Milan and Naples followed. The taking of
   Milan reduced Alexander's former ally and brought captivity to Ascanio
   Sforza, the cardinal, but it was welcome news in the Vatican. Alexander
   was bent, with the help of Louis, upon creating a great dukedom in
   central Italy for his son, with a kingly dominion over all the
   peninsula as the ultimate act of the drama. The fall of Naples was due
   in part to the pope's perfidy in making an alliance with Louis and
   deposing the Neapolitan king, Frederick.

   Endowed by his father with the proud title of duke of the Romagna and
   made captain-general of the church, Caesar, with the help of 8,000
   mercenaries, made good his rights to Imola, Forli, Rimini and other
   towns, some of the victories being celebrated by services in St.
   Peter's. At the same time, Lucretia was made regent of Nepi and
   Spoleto. As a part of the family program, the indulgent father
   proceeded to declare war against the Gaetani house and to despoil the
   Colonna, Savelli and Orsini. No obstacle should be allowed to remain in
   the ambitious path of the unscrupulous son. Upon him was also conferred
   that emblem of purity of character or of high service to the Church,
   the Golden Rose.

   The celebration of the Jubilee in the opening year of the new century,
   which was to be so eventful, brought hundreds of thousands of pilgrims
   to the holy city, and the great sums which were collected were reserved
   for the Turkish crusade, or employed for the advancement of the
   Borgias. The bull announcing the festival offered to those visiting
   Rome free indulgence for the most grievous sins. [804] On Christmas
   eve, 1499, Alexander struck the Golden Gate with a silver mallet,
   repeating the words of Revelation, "He openeth and no man shutteth."

   In glaring contrast to the religious ends with which the Jubilee was
   associated in the minds of the pilgrims, Caesar entered Rome, in
   February, surrounded with all the trappings of military conquest. Among
   the festivities provided to relieve the tedium of religious occupations
   was a Spanish bull-fight. The square of St. Peter's was enclosed with a
   railing and the spectators looked on while the pope's son, Caesar,
   killed five bulls. The head of the last he severed with a single stroke
   of his sword.

   Another of the fearful tragedies of the Borgia family filled the
   atmosphere of this holy year with its smothering fumes, the murder of
   Lucretia's husband, the duke of Besiglia, to whom she had borne a son.
   [805] On returning home at night he was fallen upon at the steps of St.
   Peter's and stabbed. Carried to his palace, he was recovering, when
   Caesar, who had visited him several times, at last had him strangled,
   August 18, 1500. The pope's son openly declared his responsibility, and
   gave as an explanation that he himself was in danger from the prince.

   With such scenes the new century was introduced in the papal city. But
   the end was not yet. The appointment of cardinals had been prostituted
   into a convenient device for filling the papal coffers and advancing
   the schemes of the papal family. In 1493 Alexander added 12 to the
   sacred college, including Alexander Farnese, afterwards Paul III., and
   brother to the pope's mistress. From these creations more than 100,000
   ducats are said to have been realized. [806] In 1496 four more were
   added, all Spaniards, including the pope's nephew, Giovanni Borgia, and
   making 9 Spaniards in Alexander's cabinet. When 12 cardinals were
   appointed, Sept. 28, 1500, Caesar reaped 120,000 ducats as his reward.
   He had openly explained that he needed the money for his designs in the
   Romagna. In 1503, just before his father's death, the duke received
   130,000 more for 9 red hats. He raised 64,000 by the appointment of new
   abbreviators. Nor were the dead to go free. At the death of Cardinal
   Ferrari, 50,000 ducats were seized from his effects, and when Cardinal
   Michïel died, nephew of Paul II., 150,000 ducats were transferred to
   the duke's account.

   One iniquity only led to another, Cardinal Orsini, while on a visit to
   the pope, was taken prisoner. His palace was dismantled, and other
   members of the family seized and their castles confiscated. The
   cardinal's mother, aged fourscore, secured from Alexander, upon the
   payment of 2,000 ducats and a costly pearl which Orsini's mistress had
   in her possession and, dressed as a man, took to Alexander, [807] the
   privilege of supplying her son with a daily dole of bread. But the
   unfortunate man's doom was sealed. He came to his death, as it was
   believed, by poison prepared by Alexander. [808]

   The last of Alexander's notable achievements for his family was the
   marriage of Lucretia to Alfonso, son of Hercules, duke of Ferrara,
   1502. The young duke was 24, and a widower. The prejudices of his
   father were removed through the good offices of the king of France and
   a reduction of the tribute due from Ferrara, as a papal fief, from 400
   ducats to 100 florins, the college of cardinals giving their assent.
   While the negotiations were going on, Alexander, during an absence of
   three months from Rome, confided his correspondence and the transaction
   of his business to the hands of his daughter. This appointment made the
   college of cardinals subject to her.

   Lucretia entered with zest into the settlement of the preliminaries
   leading up to the betrothal and into the preparations for the nuptials.
   When the news of the signing of the marriage contract reached Rome,
   early in September, 1501, she went to S. Maria del Popolo, accompanied
   by 300 knights and four bishops, and gave public thanks. On the way she
   took off her cloak, said to be worth 300 ducats, and gave it to her
   buffoon. Putting it on, he rode through the streets crying out, "Hurrah
   for the most illustrious duchess of Ferrara. Hurrah for Alexander VI."
   [809] For three hours the great bell on the capitol was kept ringing,
   and bonfires were lit through the city to "incite everybody to joy."
   The pope's daughter, although she had been four times betrothed and
   twice married, was only 21 at the time of her last engagement.
   According to the Ferrarese ambassador, her face was most beautiful and
   her manners engaging. [810] In the brilliant escort sent by Hercules to
   conduct his future daughter-in-law to her new home, were the duke's two
   younger sons, who were entertained at the Vatican. Caesar and 19
   cardinals, including Cardinal Hippolytus of Este, met the escort at the
   Porto del Popolo. Night after night, the Vatican was filled with the
   merriment of dancing and theatrical plays. At her father's request,
   Lucretia performed special dances. The formal ceremony of marriage was
   performed, December 30th, in St. Peter's, Don Ferdinand acting as proxy
   for his brother. Preceded by 50 maids of honor, a duke on each side of
   her, the bride proceeded to the basilica. Her approach was announced by
   musicians playing in the portico. Within on his throne sat the pontiff,
   surrounded by 13 cardinals. After a sermon, which Alexander ordered
   made short, a ring was put on Lucretia's finger by Duke Ferdinand. Then
   the Cardinal d'Este approached, laying on a table 4 other rings, a
   diamond, an emerald, a turquoise and a ruby, and, at his order, a
   casket was opened which contained many jewels, including a head-dress
   of 16 diamonds and 150 large pearls. But with exquisite courtesy, the
   prelate begged the princess not to spurn the gift, as more gems were
   awaiting her in Ferrara.

   The rest of the night was spent in a banquet in the Vatican, when
   comedies were rendered, in which Caesar was one of the leading figures.
   To their credit be it said, that some of the cardinals and other
   dignitaries preferred to retire early. The week which followed was
   filled with entertainments, including a bull-fight on St. Peter's
   square, in which Caesar again was entered as a matador.

   The festivities were brought to a close Jan. 6th, 1502. 150 mules
   carried the bride's trousseau and other baggage. The lavish father had
   told her to take what she would. Her dowry in money was 100,000 ducats.
   A brilliant cavalcade, in which all the cardinals and ambassadors and
   the magistrates of the municipality took part, accompanied the party to
   the city gates and beyond, while Cardinal Francesco Borgia accompanied
   the party the whole journey. In this whole affair, in spite of
   ourselves, sympathy for a father supplants our indignation at his
   perfidy in violating the sacred vows of a Catholic priest and the
   pledge of the supreme pontiff. Alexander followed the cavalcade as far
   as he could with his eye, changing his position from window to window.
   But no mention is made by any of the writers of the bride's mother. Was
   she also a witness of the gayeties from some concealed or open
   standing-place?

   Lucretia never returned to Rome. And so this famous woman, whose
   fortunes awaken the deepest interest and also the deepest sympathy,
   passes out from the realm of this history and she takes her place in
   the family annals of the noble house of Este. She gained the respect of
   the court and the admiration of the city, living a quiet, domestic life
   till her death in 1519. Few mortals have seen transpire before their
   own eyes and in so short a time so much of dissemblance and crime as
   she. She was not forty when she died. The old representation, which
   made her the heroine of the dagger and the poisoned cup and guilty of
   incest, has given way to the milder judgment of Reumont and
   Gregorovius, with whom Pastor agrees. While they do not exonerate her
   from all profligacy, they rescue her from being an abandoned Magdalen,
   and make appeal to our considerate judgment by showing that she was
   made by her father an instrument of his ambitions for his family and
   that at last she exhibited the devotion of a wife and of a mother. Her
   son, Hercules, who reigned till 1559, was the husband of Renée, the
   princess who welcomed Calvin and Clement Marot to her court.

   Death finally put an end to the scandals of Alexander's reign. After an
   entertainment given by Cardinal Hadrian, the pope and his son Caesar
   were attacked with fever. It was reported that the poison which they
   had prepared for a cardinal was by mistake or intentionally put into
   the cups they themselves used. [811] The pontiff's sickness lasted less
   than a week. The third day he was bled. On his death-bed he played
   cards with some of his cardinals. At the last, he received the
   eucharist and extreme unction and died in the presence of five members
   of the sacred college. It is especially noted by that well-informed
   diarist, Burchard, that during his sickness Alexander never spoke a
   single word about Lucretia or his son, the duke. Caesar was too ill to
   go to his father's sick-bed but, on hearing of his death, he sent
   Micheletto to demand of the chamberlain the keys to the papal
   exchequer, threatening to strangle the cardinal, Casanova, and throw
   him out of the window in case he refused. Terrified out of his
   wits,--perterritus,--the cardinal yielded, and 100,000 ducats of gold
   and silver were carried away to the bereaved son.

   In passing an estimate upon Alexander VI., it must be remembered that
   the popular and also the carefully expressed judgments of
   contemporaries are against him. [812] The rumor was current that the
   devil himself was present at the death-scene and that, paying the price
   he had promised him for the gift of the papacy 12 years before,
   Alexander replied to the devil's beckonings that he well understood the
   time had come for the final stage of the transaction. [813]

   Alexander's intellectual abilities have abundant proof in the results
   of his diplomacy by which be was enabled to plot for the political
   advancement of Caesar Borgia, with the support of France, at whose feet
   he had at one time been humbled, by his winning back the support of the
   disaffected cardinals, and by his immunity from personal hurt through
   violence, unless it be through poison at last. That which marks him out
   for unmitigated condemnation is his lack of principle. Mental ability,
   which is ascribed to the devil himself, is no substitute for moral
   qualities. Perfidy, treachery, greed, lust and murder were stored up in
   Alexander's heart. [814] While he shrank from the commission of no
   crime to reach the objects of his ambition, he was wont to engage in
   the solemn exercises of devotion, and even to say the mass with his own
   lips. To measure his iniquity, as has been said, one need only compare
   his actions with the simple statement of the precepts, "Thou shalt not
   kill, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not steal." Elevation
   to a position of responsibility usually has the effect of sobering a
   man's spirit, but Rodrigo Borgia degraded the highest office in the
   gift of Christendom for his own carnal designs. The moral qualities and
   aims of Gregory VII. and Innocent III., however much we may dissent
   from those aims, command respect. Alexander VI. was sensual, and his
   ability to govern men, no matter how great it was, should not moderate
   the abhorrence which his depraved aims arouse. The man with brute force
   can hold others in terror, but he is a brute, nevertheless. The
   standards, it must be confessed, of life in Rome were low when Rodrigo
   was made cardinal, and a Roman chronicler could say that every priest
   had his mistress and almost all the Roman monasteries had been turned
   into lupinaria -- brothels. [815] But holy traditions still lingered
   around the sacred places of the city; the solemn rites of the Christian
   ritual were still performed; the dissoluteness of the Roman emperors
   still seemed hellish when compared with the sacrifice of the cross. And
   yet, two years before Alexander's death, October 31, 1501, an orgy took
   place in the Vatican by Caesar's appointment whose obscenity the worst
   of the imperial revels could hardly have surpassed. 50 courtezans spent
   the night dancing, with the servants and others present, first with
   their clothes on and then nude, the pope and Lucretia looking on. The
   women, still naked, and going on their hands and feet, picked up
   chestnuts thrown on the ground, and then received prizes of cloaks,
   shoes, caps and other articles. [816]

   To Alexander nothing was sacred,--office, virtue, marriage, or life. As
   cardinal he was present at the nuptials of the young Julia Farnese, and
   probably at that very moment conceived the purpose of corrupting her,
   and in a few months she was his acknowledged mistress. The cardinal of
   Gurk said to the Florentine envoy, "When I think of the pope's life and
   the lives of some of his cardinals, I shudder at the thought of
   remaining in the curia, and I will have nothing to do with it unless
   God reforms His Church." It was a biting thrust when certain German
   knights, summoned to Rome, wrote to the pontiff that they were good
   Christians and served the Count Palatine, who worshipped God, loved
   justice, hated vice and was never accused of adultery. "We believe,"
   they went on, "in a just God who will punish with eternal flames
   robbery, sacrilege, violence, abuse of the patrimony of Christ,
   concubinage, simony and other enormities by which the Christian Church
   is being scandalized." [817]

   It is pleasant to turn to the few acts of this last pontificate of the
   15th century which have another aspect than pure selfishness or
   depravity. In 1494, Alexander canonized Anselm without, however,
   referring to the Schoolman's great treatise on the atonement, or his
   argument for the existence of God. [818] He promoted the cult of St.
   Anna, the Virgin Mary's reputed mother, to whom Luther was afterwards
   devoted. [819] He almost blasphemously professed himself under the
   special protection of the Virgin, to whom he ascribed his deliverance
   from death on several occasions, by sea and in the papal palace.

   In accord with the later practice of the Roman Catholic Church,
   Alexander restricted the freedom of the press, ordering that no volume
   should be published without episcopal sanction. [820] His name meets
   the student of Western discovery in its earliest period, but his
   treatment of America shows that he was not informed of the purposes of
   Providence. In two bulls, issued May 4th and 5th, 1493, he divided the
   Western world between Portugal and Spain by a line 100 leagues west of
   the Azores, running north and south. These documents mention
   Christopher Columbus as a worthy man, much to be praised, who, apt as a
   sailor, and after great perils, labors and expenditures, had discovered
   islands and continents--terras firmas -- never before known. The
   possession of the lands in the West, discovered and yet to be
   discovered, was assigned to Spain and Portugal to be held and governed
   in perpetuity,--in perpetuum,--and the pope solemnly declared that he
   made the gift out of pure liberality, and by the authority of the
   omnipotent God, conceded to him in St. Peter, and by reason of the
   vicarship of Jesus Christ, which he administered on earth. [821]
   Nothing could be more distinctly stated. As Peter's successor,
   Alexander claimed the right to give away the Western Continent, and his
   gift involved an unending right of tenure. This prerogative of
   disposing of the lands in the West was in accordance with Constantine's
   invented gift to Sylvester, recorded in the spurious Isidorian
   decretals. [822]

   If any papal bull might be expected to have the quality of inerrancy,
   it is the bull bearing so closely on the destinies of the great
   American continent, and through it on the world's history. But the
   terms of the bull of May 4th were set aside a year after its issue by
   the political treaty of Tordesillas, June 7, 1494, which shifted the
   line to a distance 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands. And the
   centuries have rudely overturned the supreme pontiff's solemn bequest
   until not a foot of land on this Western continent remains in the
   possession of the kingdoms to which it was given. Putting aside the
   distinctions between doctrinal and disciplinary decisions, which are
   made by many Catholic exponents of the dogma of papal infallibility,
   Alexander's bull conferring the Americas, as Innocent III.'s bull
   pronouncing the stipulations of the Magna Charta forever null, should
   afford a sufficient refutation of the dogma.

   The character and career of Alexander VI. afford an argument against
   the theory of the divine institution and vicarial prerogatives of the
   papacy which the doubtful exegesis of our Lord's words to Peter ought
   not to be allowed to counteract. If we leave out all the wicked popes
   of the 9th and 10th centuries, forget for a moment the cases of
   Honorius and other popes charged with heresy, and put aside the
   offending popes of the Renaissance period and all the bulls which sin
   against common reason, such as Innocent VIII.'s bull against
   witchcraft, Alexander is enough to forbid that theory. Could God commit
   his Church for 12 years to such a monster? It is fair to recognize that
   Catholic historians feel the difficulty, although they find a way to
   explain it away. Cardinal Hergenröther says that, Christendom was
   delivered from a great offence by Alexander's death, but even in his
   case, unworthy as this pope was, his teachings are to be obeyed, and in
   him the promise made to the chair of St. Peter was fulfilled (Matt.
   23:2, 3). In no instance did Alexander VI. prescribe to the Church
   anything contrary to morals or the faith, and never did he lead her
   astray in disciplinary decrees which, for the most part, were
   excellent." [823]

   In like strain, Pastor writes: [824] In spite of Alexander, the purity
   of the Church's teaching continued unharmed. It was as if Providence
   wanted to show that men may injure the Church, but that it is not in
   their power to destroy it. As a bad setting does not diminish the value
   of the precious stone, so the sinfulness of a priest cannot do any
   essential detriment either to his dispensation of her sacraments or to
   the doctrines committed to her. Gold remains gold, whether dispensed by
   clean hands or unclean. The papal office is exalted far above the
   personality of its occupants, and cannot lose its dignity or gain
   essential worth by the worthiness or unworthiness of its occupants.
   Peter sinned deeply, and yet the supreme pastoral office was committed
   to him. It was from this standpoint that Pope Leo the Great declared
   that the dignity of St. Peter is not lost, even in an unworthy
   successor. Petri dignitas etiam in indigno haeredo non deficit." Leo's
   words Pastor adopts as the motto of his history.

   In such reasoning, the illustrations beg the question. No matter how
   clean or unclean the hands may be which handle it, lead remains lead,
   and no matter whether the setting be gold or tin, an opaque stone
   remains opaque which is held by them. The personal opinion of Leo the
   Great will not be able to stand against the growing judgment of
   mankind, that the Head of the Church does not commit the keeping of
   sacred truth to wicked hands or confide the pastorate over the Church
   to a man of unholy and lewd lips. The papal theory of the succession of
   Peter, even if there were no other hostile historic testimony, would
   founder on the personality of Alexander VI., who set an example of all
   depravity. Certainly the true successors of Peter will give in their
   conduct some evidence of the fulfilment of Christ's words "the kingdom
   of heaven is within you." Who looks for an illustration of obedience to
   the mandates of the Most High to the last pontiff of the 15th century!

   [786] Pastor, III. 278, says that, "from the moment he received
   priestly consecration to the end of his life, he was a slave to the
   demon of sensuality." Hefele-Knöpfler, Kirchengesch., p. 485, speaks of
   his career before he reached the papal office as having been "very
   dissolute"--sehr dissolut. Prof. Villari, Machiavelli, I. 279, calls
   Alexander the worst of the popes, whose "crimes were sufficient to
   upset any human society." Gregorovius and Pastor have carried on the
   most notable researches in this period, and rivalled one another in the
   brilliant description of Alexander's reign and domestic relations.

   Pastor, 1st ed., III. 879, Giovanni Boccaccio, bishop of Modena, gives
   an estimate of Borgia's ability to pay for the tiara, the
   vice-chancellorship worth 8,000 ducats, the cities of Nepi and Civita
   Castellana, abbeys In Aquila and Albano, each worth 1,000 ducats a
   year, two large abbeys in the kingdom of Naples, the abbey of Sabiaco,
   worth 2,000 a year., abbeys in Spain, 16 bishoprics in Spain, the see

   formerly in S. Maria del Popolo reads, Vanotiae Cathanae, Caesare
   Valentiae, Joane Candiae, Jufredo Scylatii et Lucretiae Ferrariae,
   ducibus filiis, etc. See Creighton, III. 163, Pastor, III. 279. Pastor
   says that to deny the authenticity of this inscription as Ollivier does
   is nothing less than ridiculous--geradezu lächerlich. On Ollivier's
   attempt to rehabilitate Alexander, see Pastor's caustic words in 1st
   ed., I. 589. Burchard constantly calls Lucretia papae filia, II. 278,
   386, 493, etc., and Joffré and the other boys his sons. So also
   Sigismondo II. 249, 270, etc. The nativity of Pedro Ludovico is not

   mother.

   Burchard, III. 170, calls the child's mother quaedam Romana. Following
   Burchard, Gregorovius and Pastor have no doubt that it was Alexander's
   own child. Pastor, III. 475, says that the bull is unquestionably
   genuine. A satire of the year 1500 ascribes to Alexander 3 or 4
   children by Julia Farnese. According to Villari, Life of Savonarola, p.
   376, note, the Civilta cattolica, the papal organ at Rome, March 15,
   1873, acknowledged the existence of Giovanni, as Alexander's sixth or
   seventh child.

   [797] These letters are given in full by Burchard, II. 202 sqq.
   Alexander's letters Gregorovius pronounces to be genuine beyond a
   doubt. The sultan's are matter of dispute. Ranke discredited them, but
   Gregorovius regards their contents as genuine, though the form may be
   spurious. Creighton, III. 300 sqq., gives reasons for accepting them.

   [800] Burchard's account of the tragedy, II. 387-390. Gregorovius,
   VIII. 424, confidently advocates the theory of fratricide. This
   explains why Alexander dropped the investigation two weeks after it was
   begun, and why he and Caesar in the first meetings after the event were
   silent in each other's presence. However, it is almost too much to
   believe that Alexander would at once begin to heap honors upon Caesar,
   as he did, if the father believed him to be the murderer. Roscoe, I.
   153 sq., and Pastor discredit the theory of fratricide, to which
   Creighton, III. 388, also inclines. Don Juan was the only one of the
   Borgias that founded a family.

   [802] Infessura, p. 286 sq., closes his account by saying he would not

   Borgia, pp. 59-61.

   [803] Alexander had courteously attended a mass for the repose of the

   [807] Burchard, III. 236.

   [808] So Pastor, though with some hesitation, III. 491. Even Creighton,
   IV. 40, is unwilling to dismiss the charge as groundless. But in
   another place, p. 265, he seems to contradict himself.

   [809] Burchard, III. 161 sq.

   [810] The letter is given in Gregor., Lucr. Borgia, p. 212.

   [811] The question of whether or no poison was the cause of the pope's
   death must be regarded as an open one. This is the view taken by
   Gregorovius, Roscoe, I. 193 sq., Reumont, Pastor, III. 499. Creighton,
   IV. 43, and Hergenröther, III. 987, are against the theory of
   poisoning. Neither Burchard nor the ambassador of Venice speak of
   poison. The ambassador of Mantua, writing on the 19th, denies the
   charge, which was freely made on the streets. Ranke, D. röm. Päpste, p.
   35, distinctly decides for poisoning. So also Hase, Kirchengesch., III.
   353. Many contemporary writers pronounced for poisoning, Guicciardini,
   Cardinal Bembo, Jovius, Cardinal Aegidius, etc. Alexander's physician
   gave as the immediate cause of death apoplexy. Against the theory of
   poisoning is the fact that Cardinal Hadrian was also taken sick. On the
   other hand is the evidence that Alexander's body immediately after
   death was bloated and disfigured and his mouth was filled with foam,
   and that Caesar was taken sick at the same time with the same symptoms,
   a fact which Gregorovius, VII. 521, pronounces the strongest evidence
   for the theory of poisoning.

   [812] There is one exception, the address made in the conclave after
   Alexander's death by the bishop of Gallipolis. See Garnett's art. Engl.
   Hist. Rev., 1892, p. 311 sq., giving the text of the British Museum,
   the only copy in existence.

   [813] The duke of Mantua, whose camp was near Rome, wrote to his
   duchess that seven devils appeared in the pope's room at the moment of
   his death, that the body swelled and was dragged from the bed with a
   cord. Gregorovius, Lucr. Borgia, p. 288.

   [814] Bishop Creighton, IV. 44, lays stress on the fact that hypocrisy
   was not added to Alexander's other vices.

   [815] Infessura, p. 287.

   [816] Burchard, III. 167, who reports the wild scene, was reticent
   about many of the evil happenings in the papal palace. The other
   authorities for the orgy may be seen in Thuasne's ed. of Burchard. See
   also Villari, Machiavelli, I. 538. When we are taken to the square of
   St. Peter's, where the pope and the cardinals watched a feat of
   tight-rope walking, an expert walking with a child in his arms, we may
   easily applaud or tolerate the recreation, Burchard, III. 210; but the
   dark furies of evil seem at will to have had mastery over Alexander's
   soul.

   [817] Burchard, III. 110.

   [818] Mansi, XXXII. 533 sq.

   [819] Calvin spoke of having been taken as a child by his mother to the

   [822] Pastor, III. 520, seeks to break the force of the charge that
   Alexander's gift was a short-sighted piece of work by putting the
   unnatural interpretation upon donamus et assignamus, that it referred
   only to what Portugal and Spain had already acquired. But the very
   wording of the bull makes this impossible, for it is distinctly said
   that all islands and continents were given to Spain and Portugal which
   were to be discovered in the future, as well as those which were
   already discovered--omnes insulas et terras firmas inventas et
   inveniendas, detectas et detegendas. For the bull of Sept. 26, 1493,

   [824] III. 503

   [825] Pastor, in the course of prolonged estimates, Gesch. der Päpste,
   III. pp. vi, 601sq., etc., says: "The life of this
   voluptuary--Genussmenschen --a man of untamed sensuality, contradicted
   at every point the demands of him he was called upon to represent. With
   unrestrained abandon, he gave himself up to a vicious life until his
   end." Ranke thus expresses himself, Hist. of the Popes, Germ. ed., I.
   32. "All his life through, Alexander was bent on nothing else than to
   enjoy the world, to live pleasurably, to satisfy his passions and
   ambitions." The estimate of Gregorovius, City of Rome, VII. 525, is
   this: "No one can ever discover in Alexander's history any other
   guiding principle than the contemptible one of aggrandizing his
   children at any cost. To the despicable objects of nepotism and
   self-preservation he sacrificed his own conscience, the happiness of
   nations, the existence of Italy and the good of the Church." Bishop
   Creighton, IV. 43-49, lays such elaborate emphasis upon Alexander's
   knowledge of politics, firmness of purpose and affability of manners
   that one loses the impression of the baseness of his morals and the
   sacrilege to which he subjected his office and himself. He seems to
   have been influenced by Roscoe's presentation of Alexander's "many
   great qualities," I. 195.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 55. Julius II., the Warrior-Pope. 1503-1513.

   Alexander's successor, Pius III., a nephew of Pius II., and a man of
   large family, succumbed, within a month after his election, to the gout
   and other infirmities. He was followed by Julian Rovere, Alexander's
   old rival, who, as cardinal, had played a conspicuous part for more
   than 30 years. He proved to be the ablest and most energetic pontiff
   the Church had had since the days of Innocent III. and Gregory IX. in
   the 13th century.

   At Alexander's death, Caesar Borgia attempted to control the situation.
   He afterwards told Machiavelli that he had made provision for every
   exigency except the undreamed-of conjunction of his own and his
   father's sickness. [826] Consternation ruled in Rome, but with the aid
   of the ambassadors of France, Germany, Venice and Spain, Caesar was
   prevailed upon to withdraw from the city, while the Orsini and the
   Colonna families, upon which Alexander had heaped high insult, entered
   it again.

   The election of Julian Rovere, who assumed the name of Julius II., was
   accomplished with despatch October 31, 1503, after bribery had been
   freely resorted to. The Spanish cardinals, 11 in number and still in a
   measure under Caesar's control, gave their votes to the successful
   candidate on condition that Caesar should be recognized as gonfalonier
   of the church. The faithful papal master-of-ceremonies, whose Diary we
   have had occasion to draw on so largely, was appointed bishop of Orta,
   but died two years later. Born in Savona of humble parentage and
   appointed to the sacred college by his uncle, Sixtus IV., Julius had
   recently returned to Rome after an exile of nearly 10 years. The income
   from his numerous bishoprics and other dignities made him the richest
   of the cardinals. Though piety was not one of the new pontiff's notable
   traits, his pontificate furnished an agreeable relief from the coarse
   crimes and domestic scandals of Alexander's reign. It is true, he had a
   family of three daughters, one of whom, Felice, was married into the
   Orsini family in 1506, carrying with her a splendid dowry of 15,000
   ducats. But the marriage festivities were not appointed for the
   Vatican, nor did the children give offence by their ostentatious
   presence in the pontifical palace. Julius also took care of his
   nephews. Two of them were appointed to the sacred college, Nov. 29,
   1503, and later two more were honored with the same dignity. For making
   the Spanish scholar, Ximenes, cardinal, Julius deserved well of other
   ages as well as his own. He was a born ruler. He had a dignified and
   imposing presence and a bright, penetrating eye. Under his white hair
   glowed the intellectual fire of youth. He was rapid in his movements
   even to impetuosity, and brave even to daring. Defeats that would have
   disheartened even the bravest seemed only to intensify Julius'
   resolution. If his language was often violent, the excuse is offered
   that violence of speech was common at that time. As a cardinal he had
   shown himself a diplomat rather than a saint, and as pope he showed
   himself a warrior rather than a priest. When Michael Angelo, who was
   ordered to execute the pope's statue in bronze, was representing Julius
   with his right hand raised, the pope asked, "What are you going to put
   into the left?" "It may be a book," answered the artist. "Nay, give me
   a sword, for I am no scholar," was the pope's reply. Nothing could be
   more characteristic. [827]

   Julius' administration at once brought repose and confidence to the
   sacred college and Rome. If he did not keep his promise to abide by the
   protocol adopted in the conclave calling for the assembling of a
   council within two years, he may be forgiven on the ground of the
   serious task he had before him in strengthening the political authority
   of the papal see. This was the chief aim of his pontificate. He
   deserves the title of the founder of the State of the Church, a realm
   that, with small changes, remained papal territory till 1870. This end
   being secured, he devoted himself to redeeming Italy from its foreign
   invaders. Three foes stood in his way, Caesar and the despots of the
   Italian cities, the French who were intrenched in Milan and Genoa, and
   the Spaniards who held Naples and Sicily. His effort to rescue Italy
   for the Italians won for him the grateful regard due an Italian
   patriot. Like Innocent III., he closed his reign with an oecumenical
   council.

   Caesar Borgia returned to Rome, was recognized as gonfalonier and given
   apartments in the Vatican. Julius had been in amicable relations with
   the prince in France and advanced his marriage, and Caesar wrote that
   in him he had found a second father. But Caesar now that Alexander was
   dead, was as a galley without a rudder. He was an upstart; Julius a man
   of power and far-reaching plans. Prolonged co-operation between the two
   was impossible. The one was sinister, given to duplicity; the other
   frank and open to brusqueness. The encroachment of Venice upon the
   Romagna gave the occasion at once for Caesar's fall and for the full
   restoration of papal authority in that region. Supporters Caesar had
   none who could be relied upon in the day of ill success. He no longer
   had the power which the control of patronage gives. Julius demanded the
   keys of the towns of the Romagna as a measure necessary to the
   dislodgment of Venice. Caesar yielded, but withdrew to Ostia,
   meditating revenge. He was seized, carried back to Rome and placed in
   the castle of S. Angelo, which had been the scene of his dark crimes.
   He was obliged to give up the wealth gotten at his father's death and
   to sign a release of Forli and other towns. Liberty was then given him
   to go where be pleased. He accepted protection from the Spanish
   captain, Gonsalvo de Cordova, but on his arrival in Naples the
   Spaniard, with despicable perfidy, seized the deceived man and sent him
   to Spain, August, 1504. For two years he was held a prisoner, when he
   escaped to the court of his brother-in-law, the king of Navarre. He was
   killed at the siege of Viana, 1507, aged 31. Thus ended the career of
   the man who had once been the terror of Rome, whom Ranke calls "a
   virtuoso in crime," and Machiavelli chose as the model of a civil
   ruler. This political writer had met Caesar after Julius' elevation,
   and in his Prince [828] says, "It seems good to me to propose Caesar
   Borgia as an example to be imitated by all those who through fortune
   and the arms of others have attained to supreme command. For, as he had
   a great mind and great ambitions, it was not possible for him to govern
   otherwise." Caesar had said to the theorist, "I rob no man. I am here
   to act the tyrant's part and to do away with tyrants." Only if to
   obtain power by darkness and assassination is worthy of admiration, and
   if to crush all individual liberty is a just end of government, can the
   Machiavellian ideal be regarded with other feelings than those of utter
   reprobation. There is something pathetic in the recollection that, to
   the end, this inhuman brother retained the affection of his sister,
   Lucretia. She pled for his release from imprisonment in Spain, and
   Caesar's letter to her announcing his escape is still extant. [829]
   When the rumor came of his death, Lucretia despatched her servant,
   Tullio, to Navarre to find out the truth, and gave herself up to
   protracted prayer on her brother's behalf. This beautiful example of a
   sister's love would seem to indicate that Caesar possessed by nature
   some excellent qualities.

   Julius was also actively engaged in repairing some of the other evils
   of Alexander's reign and making amends for its injustices. He restored
   Sermoneta to the dukes of Gaetani. The document which pronounced severe
   reprobation upon Alexander ran, "our predecessor, desiring to enrich
   his own kin, through no zeal for justice, but by fraud and deceit,
   sought for causes to deprive the Gaetani of their possessions." With
   decisive firmness, he announced his purpose to assert his lawful
   authority over the papal territory and, accompanied by 9 cardinals, he
   left Rome at the head of 500 men and proceeded to make good the
   announcement. Perugia was quickly brought to terms; and, aided by the
   French, the pope entered Bologna, against which he had launched the
   interdict. Returning to Rome, he was welcomed as a conqueror. The
   victorious troops passed under triumphal arches, including a
   reproduction of Constantine's arch erected on St. Peter's square; and,
   accompanied by 28 members of the sacred college, Julius gave solemn
   thanks in St. Peter's. [830]

   The next to be brought to terms was Venice. In vain had the pope,
   through letters and legates, called upon the doge to give up Rimini,
   Faenza, Forli and other parts of the Romagna upon which he had laid his
   hand. In March, 1508, he joined the alliance of Cambrai, the other
   parties being Louis XII. and the emperor Maximilian, and later,
   Ferdinand of Spain. This agreement decided in cold blood upon the
   division of the Venetian possessions, and bound the parties to a war
   against the Turk. France was confirmed in the tenure of Milan, and
   given Cremona and Brescia. Maximilian was to have Verona, Padua and
   Aquileja; Naples, the Venetian territories in Southern Italy; Hungary,
   Dalmatia; Savoy, Cyprus; and the Apostolic see, the lands of which it
   had been dispossessed. It was high-handed robbery, even though a pope
   was party to it. Julius, who had promised to add the punishments of the
   priestly office to the force of arms, proceeded with merciless
   severity, and placed the republic under the interdict, April 27, 1509.
   In vain did Venice appeal to God and a general council. Past sins
   enough were written against her to call for severe treatment. She was
   forced to surrender Rimini, Faenza and Ravenna, and was made to drink
   the cup of humiliation to its dregs. The city renounced her claim to
   nominate to bishoprics and benefices and tax the clergy without the
   papal consent. The Adriatic she was forced to open to general commerce.
   Her envoys, who appeared in Roma to make public apology for the sins of
   the proud state, were subjected to the insult of listening on their
   knees to a service performed outside the walls of St. Peter's and
   lasting an hour; at every verse of the Miserere the pope and 12
   cardinals, each with a golden rod, touched them. Then, service over,
   the doors of the cathedral were thrown open and absolution pronounced.
   [831] The next time Venice was laid under the papal ban, the measure
   failed.

   Julius' plans were next directed against the French, the impudent
   invaders of Northern Italy and claimants of sovereignty over it. Times
   had changed since the pope, as cardinal Julian Rovere, had accompanied
   the French army under Charles VIII. The absolution of Venice was
   tantamount to the pope's withdrawal from the alliance of Cambrai. By
   making Venice his ally, he hoped to bring Ferrara again under the
   authority of the holy see. The duchy had flourished under the warm
   support of the French.

   Julius now made a far-reaching stroke in securing the help of the
   Swiss, who had been fighting under the banners of France. The hardy
   mountaineers, who now find it profitable to entertain tourists from all
   over the world, then found it profitable to sell their services in war.
   With the aid of their vigorous countryman, Bishop Schinner of Sitten,
   afterwards made cardinal, the pope contracted for 6,000 Swiss
   mercenaries for five years. The localities sending them received 13,000
   gulden a year, and each soldier 6 francs a month, and the officers,
   twice that sum. As chaplain of the Swiss troops, Zwingli went to Rome
   three times, a course of which his patriotism afterwards made him
   greatly ashamed. The descendants of these Swiss mercenaries defended
   Louis XVI., and their heroism is commemorated by Thorwaldsen's lion,
   cut into the rock at Lucerne. Swiss guards, dressed in yellow suits, to
   this day patrol the approaches and halls of the Vatican. [832]

   The French king, Louis XII. (1498-1515), sought to break Julius' power
   by adding to the force of arms the weight of a religious assembly and,
   at his instance, the French bishops met in council at Tours, September,
   1510, and declared that the pope had put aside the keys of St. Peter,
   which his predecessors had employed, and seized the sword of Paul. They
   took the ground that princes were justified in opposing him with force,
   even to withdrawing obedience and invading papal territory. [833] As in
   the reign of Philip the Fair, so now moneys were forbidden transferred
   from France to Rome, and a call was made by 9 cardinals for a council
   to meet at Pisa on Sept. 1st, 1511. This council of Tours denounced
   Julius as "the new Goliath," and Louis had a coin struck off with the
   motto, I will destroy the name of Babylon--perdam Babylonis nomen.
   Calvin, in the year of his death, sent to Renée, duchess of Ferrara,
   one of these medals which in his letter, dated Jan. 8, 1564, he
   declared to be the finest present he had it in his power to make her.
   Renée was the daughter of Louis XII. Julius excommunicated Alfonso,
   duke of Ferrara, as a son of iniquity and a root of perdition. Thus we
   have the spectacle of the supreme priest of Christendom and the most
   Christian king, the First Son of the Church, again engaged in war with
   one another.

   At the opening of the campaign, Julius was in bed with a sickness which
   was supposed to be mortal; but to the amazement of his court, he
   suddenly arose and, in the dead of Winter, January, 1511, betook
   himself to the camp of the papal forces. His promptness of action was
   in striking contrast to the dilatory policy of Louis, who spent his
   time writing letters and summoning ecclesiastical assemblies when he
   ought to have been on the march. From henceforth till his death, the
   pope wore a beard, as he is represented in Raphael's famous portrait.
   [834] Snow covered the ground, but Julius set an example by enduring
   all the hardships of the camp. To accomplish the defeat of the French,
   he brought about the Holy League, October, 1511, Spain and Venice being
   the other parties. Later, these three allies were joined by Maximilian
   and Henry VIII. of England. Henry had been honored with the Golden
   Rose. [835] Henry's act was England's first positive entrance upon the
   field of general European politics.

   In the meantime the French were carrying on the Council of Pisa. The
   pope prudently counteracted its influence by calling a council to meet
   in the Lateran. Christendom was rent by two opposing ecclesiastical
   councils as well as by two opposing armies. The armies met in decisive
   conflict under the walls of the old imperial city of Ravenna. The
   leader of the French, Gaston de Foix, nephew of the French king, though
   only 24, approved himself, in spite of his youth, one of the foremost
   captains of his age. Bologna had fallen before his arms, and now
   Ravenna yielded to the same necessity after a bloody battle. The French
   army numbered 25,000, the army of the League 20,000. In the French camp
   was the French legate, Cardinal Sanseverino, mounted and clad in steel
   armor, his tall form towering above the rest. Prominent on the side of
   the allied army was the papal legate, Cardinal de' Medici, clad in
   white, and Giulio Medici, afterwards Clement VII. The battle took place
   on Easter Day, 1512. Gaston de Foix, thrown to the ground by the fall
   of his horse, was put to death by some of the seasoned Spanish soldiers
   whom Gonsalvo had trained. The victor, whose battle cry was "Let him
   that loves me follow me," was borne into the city in his coffin.
   Rimini, Forli and other cities of the Romagna opened their gates to the
   French. Cardinal Medici was in their hands.

   The papal cause seemed to be hopelessly lost, but the spirit of Julius
   rose with the defeat. He is reported to have exclaimed, "I will stake
   100,000 ducats and my crown that I will drive the French out of Italy,"
   and the victory of Ravenna proved to be another Cannae. The hardy
   Swiss, whose numbers Cardinal Schinner had increased to 18,000, and the
   Venetians pushed the campaign, and the barbarians, as Julius called the
   French, were forced to give up what they had gained, to surrender Milan
   and gradually to retire across the Alps. Parma and Piacenza, by virtue
   of the grant of Mathilda, passed into his hands, as did also Reggio.
   The victory was celebrated in Rome on an elaborate scale. Cannons
   boomed from S. Angelo, and thanks were given in all the churches. In
   recognition of their services, the pope gave to the Swiss two large
   banners and the permanent title of Protectors of the Apostolic
   see--auxiliatores sedis apostolicae. Such was the end of this
   remarkable campaign.

   Julius purchased Siena from the emperor for 30,000 ducats and, with the
   aid of the seasoned Spanish troops, took Florence and restored the
   Medici to power. In December, 1513, Maximilian, who at one time
   conceived the monstrous idea of combining with his imperial dignity the
   office of supreme pontiff, announced his support of the Lateran
   council, the pope having agreed to use all the spiritual measures
   within his reach to secure the complete abasement of Venice. The
   further execution of the plans was prevented by the pope's death. In
   his last hours, in a conversation with Cardinal Grimani, he pounded on
   the floor with his cane, exclaiming, "If God gives me life, I will also
   deliver the Neapolitans from the yoke of the Spaniards and rid the land
   of them." [836]

   The Pisan council had opened Sept. 1, 1511, with only two archbishops
   and 14 bishops present. First and last 6 cardinals attended, Carvajal,
   Briçonnet, Prie, d'Albret, Sanseverino and Borgia. The Universities of
   Paris Toulouse and Poictiers were represented by doctors. After holding
   three sessions, it moved to Milan, where the victory of Ravenna gave it
   a short breath of life. When the French were defeated, it again moved
   to Asti in Piedmont, where it held a ninth session, and then it
   adjourned to Lyons, where it dissolved of itself. [837] Hergenröther,
   Pastor and other Catholic historians take playful delight in calling
   the council the little council--conciliabulum--and a conventicle, terms
   which Julius applied to it in his bulls. [838] Among its acts were a
   fulmination against the synod Julius was holding in the Lateran, and it
   had the temerity to cite the pope to appear, and even to declare him
   deposed from all spiritual and temporal authority. The synod also
   reaffirmed the decrees of the 5th session of the Council of Constance,
   placing general councils over the pope.

   Very different in its constitution and progress was the Fifth Lateran,
   the last oecumenical council of the Middle Ages, and the 18th in the
   list of oecumenical councils, as accepted by the Roman Catholic Church.
   It lasted for nearly five years, and closed on the eve of the nailing
   of the XCV theses on the church door in Wittenberg. It is chiefly
   notable for what it failed to do rather than for anything it did. The
   only one of its declarations which is of more than temporary interest
   was the deliverance, reaffirming Boniface's theory of the supremacy of
   the Roman pontiff over all potentates and individuals whatsoever.

   In his summons calling the council, Julius deposed the cardinals, who
   had entered into the Pisan synod, as schismatics and sons of darkness.
   [839] The attendance did not compare in weight or numbers with the
   Council of Constance. At the 1st session, held May 3, 1512, there were
   present 16 cardinals, 12 patriarchs, 10 archbishops, 70 bishops and 3
   generals of orders. The opening address by Egidius of Viterbo, general
   of the Augustinian order, after dwelling upon the recent glorious
   victories of Julius, magnified the weapons of light at the council's
   disposal, piety, prayers, vows and the breastplate of faith. The
   council should devote itself to placating all Christian princes in
   order that the arms of the Christian world might be turned against the
   flagrant enemy of Christ, Mohammed. The council then declared the
   adherents of the Pisan conventicle schismatics and laid France under
   the interdict. Julius, who listened to the eloquent address, was
   present at 4 sessions.

   At the 2d session, Cajetan dilated at length on the pet papal theory of
   the two swords.

   In the 4th session, the Venetian, Marcello, pronounced a eulogy upon
   Julius which it would be hard to find excelled for fulsome flattery in
   the annals of oratory. After having borne intolerable cold, so the
   eulogist declared, and sleepless nights and endured sickness in the
   interests of the Church, and having driven the French out of Italy,
   there remained for the pontiff the greater triumphs of peace. Julius
   must be pastor, shepherd, physician, ruler, administrator and, in a
   word, another God on earth. [840]

   At the 5th session, held during the pope's last illness, a bull was
   read, severely condemning simony at papal elections. The remaining
   sessions of the council were held under Julius' successor.

   When Julius came to die, he was not yet 70. No man of his time had been
   an actor in so many stirring scenes. On his death-bed he called for
   Paris de Grassis, his master of ceremonies, and reminded him how little
   respect had been paid to the bodies of deceased popes within his
   recollection. Some of them had been left indecently nude. He then made
   him promise to see to it that he should have decent care and burial.
   [841] The cardinals were summoned. The dying pontiff addressed them
   first in Latin, and implored them to avoid all simony in the coming
   election, and reminded them that it was for them and not for the
   council to choose his successor. He pardoned the schismatic cardinals,
   but excluded them from the conclave to follow his death. And then, as
   if to emphasize the tie of birth, he changed to Italian and besought
   them to confirm his nephew, the duke of Urbino, in the possession of
   Pesaro, and then he bade them farewell. A last remedy, fluid gold, was
   administered, but in vain. He died Feb. 20, 1513. [842]

   The scenes which ensued were very different from those which followed
   upon the death of Alexander VI. A sense of awe and reverence filled the
   city. The dead pontiff was looked upon as a patriot, and his services
   to civil order in Rome and its glory counterbalanced his deficiencies
   as a priest of God. [843]

   It was of vast profit that the Vatican had been free from the domestic
   scandals which had filled it so long. From a worldly standpoint, Julius
   had exalted the papal throne to the eminence of the national thrones of
   Europe. In the terrific convulsion which Luther's onslaughts produced,
   the institution of the papacy might have fallen in ruins had not Julius
   re-established it by force of arms. But in vain will the student look
   for signs that Julius II. had any intimation of the new religious
   reforms which the times called for and Luther began. What measures this
   pope, strong in will and bold in execution, might have employed if the
   movement in the North had begun in his day, no one can surmise. The
   monk of Erfurt walked the streets of Rome during this pontificate for
   the first and only time. While Luther was ascending the scala santa on
   his knees and running about to the churches, wishing his parents were
   in purgatory that he might pray them out, Julius was having perfected a
   magnificently jewelled tiara costing 200,000 ducats, which he put on
   for the first time on the anniversary of his coronation, 1511. These
   two men, both of humble beginnings, would have been more a match for
   each other than Luther and Julius' successor, the Medici, the man of
   luxurious culture. [844]

   Under Julius II. the papal finances flourished. Great as were the
   expenditures of his campaigns, he left plate and coin estimated to be
   worth 400,000 ducats. A portion of this fund was the product of the
   sale of indulgences. He turned the forgiveness of sins for the present
   time and in purgatory into a matter of merchandise. [845]

   In another place, Julius will be presented from the standpoint of art
   and culture, whose splendid patron he was. What man ever had the
   privilege of bringing together three artists of such consummate genius
   as Bramante, Michael Angelo and Raphael! His portrait in the Pitti
   gallery, Florence, forms a rich study for those who seek in the lines
   and colors of Raphael's art the secret of the pontiff's power. [846]
   The painter has represented Julius as an old man with beard, and with
   his left hand grasping the arm of the chair in which he sits. His
   fingers wear jewelled rings. The forehead is high, the lips firmly
   pressed, the eyes betokening weariness, determination and commanding
   energy.

   In the history of the Western Continent, Julius also has some place. In
   1504 he created an archbishopric and two bishoprics of Hispaniola, or
   Hayti. The prelates to whom they were assigned never crossed the seas.
   Seven years later, 1511, he revoked these creations and established the
   sees of San Domingo and Concepcion de la Vega on the island of Hayti
   and the see of San Juan in Porto Rico, all three subject to the
   metropolitan supervision of the see of Seville.

   [827] The statue was placed in front of St. Petronio in Bologna. The
   left hand held neither book nor sword, but the keys. Pastor, III. 569,

   [828] The Prince, written in 1515, was dedicated to Leo X.'s nephew,
   Lorenzo de' Medici, at a time when it was contemplated giving Lorenzo a
   large slice of Italian territory to govern. See Villari: Machiavelli,
   III. 372-424. Also Louis Dyer: Machiavelli and the Modern State,

   [829] The letter is given by Gregorovius, Lucr. Borgia, p. 319.

   [830] The expedition is described by de Grassis, the new master of
   ceremonies at the papal palace, who accompanied the expedition, and
   also by Aegidius of Viterbo,

   [831] Pastor, III. 643, contents himself with the simple mention of the
   absolution of the Venetian's, and omits all reference to the
   humiliating conditions. The Venetian scribblers let loose their pens
   against Julius and, among other charges, made against him the charge of
   sodomy. Pastor, III. 644, Note.

   [832] Zwingli's friend, Thomas Platter (1499-1582), in speaking in his
   Autobiography of his travels in Germany as a boy to get knowledge and
   begging his bread, mentions how willing the people were to give him
   ear, "for they were very fond of the Swiss." At Breslau a family was
   ready to adopt him partly on this ground. After the defeat of Marigano,
   1515, it was a common saying, so Platter says, "The Swiss have lost
   their good luck." On one occasion near Dresden, after a good dinner, to
   which he had been treated, he was taken in to see the mother of the
   home, who was on her death-bed. She said to Platter and his Swiss
   companions, "I have heard so many good things about the Swiss that I
   was very anxious to see one before my death." See Whitcomb, Renaissance
   Source-Book, p. 108; Monroe, Thos. Platter, p. 107.

   [833] Mansi, XXXII. 555-559.

   [834] Creighton, IV. 123, unguardedly says that Julius was the first
   pope who let his beard grow. Many of the early bishops of Rome, as
   depicted in St. Peter's, wore beards. So did Clement VII. after him,
   and other popes.

   [839] A pamphlet war was waged over the council. Among the writers on
   the papal side was Thomas de Vio Gaeta, general of the Dominican order
   and afterwards famous as Cardinal Cajetan, who had the colloquies with
   Luther. His tracts were ordered burnt by Louis XII. He took the ground
   that no council can be oecumenical which has not the pope's support. An
   account of this literary skirmish is given by Hefele-Hergenröther,
   VIII. 470-480.

   [840] Tu pastor, tu medicus, tu gubernator, tu cultor, tu denique alter
   Deus in terris, Mansi, XXXII. 761. Hefele-Hergenröther VII. 528-531,
   pronounce this expression, God on earth, used before by Gregory II., a
   rhetorical flourish and nothing more. See also Pastor, III. 725.

   [841] De Grassis reports the rumors abroad concerning the pope's mortal
   malady. One of them was the Gallic disease, and another that the pope's
   stomach had given way under excessive indulgence. He also speaks of the
   great number who went to look at the pope's corpse and to kiss his
   feet. Döllinger, III. 432.

   [842] A satire, called Julius exclusus, which appeared after the
   pontiff's death, represented him as appearing at the gate of heaven
   with great din and noise. Peter remarked that, as he was a brave man,
   had a large army and much gold and was a busy builder, he might build
   his own paradise. At the same time the Apostle reminded him he would
   have to build the foundations deep and strong to resist the assaults of
   the devil. Julius retorted by peremptorily giving Peter three weeks to
   open heaven to him. In case he refused, he would open siege against him
   with 60,000 men. This recalls a story Dr. Philip Schaff used to tell of
   Gregory XVI., with whom, as a young graduate of Berlin, he had an
   audience. Gregory had a reputation with the Romans for being a
   connoisseur of wines. At his death, so the Roman wits reported, he
   appeared at the gate of heaven and, drawing out his keys, tried to
   unlock the gate. The keys would not fit. Peter, hearing the noise,
   looked out and, seeing the bunch of keys, told his vicar that he had
   brought with him by mistake the keys to his wine cellar, and must
   return to his palace and get the right set.

   [843] Guicciardini pronounces Julius a priest only in name. A letter
   dated Rome, Feb. 24, 1513, and quoted by Brosch, p. 363, has this
   statement, hic pontifex nos omnes, omnem Italiam a Barbarorum et
   Gallorum manibus eripuit, an expression used by Aegidius and Marcello
   before the Lateran council. See also Paris de Grassis-in Döllinger, p.
   482. Pastor, III. 732, and Hergenröther, Conciliengesch., VIII. 535,
   justify Julius' attention to war on the ground that he was fighting in
   a righteous cause and for possessions he had held as temporal prince
   ever since the 8th century. The right of a pope to defend the papal
   state is inherent in the very existence of a papal state. Even a saint,
   Leo IX., urges Pastor, p. 741, followed the camp.

   [844] See Ranke: Hist. of the Popes, I. 35.

   [845] Pastor, III. 575, condemns Julius under this head, tadelnswerth
   erscheint dass das Ablassgeschäft vielfach zu einer Finanzoperation
   wurde

   [846] An original cartoon of this portrait is preserved in the Corsini
   Florence. In 1889 I met Professor Weizsäcker of Tübingen in Florence
   standing before Julius' portrait and studying it. I had been with him
   in his home before he started on his journey, and he told me that one
   of the chief pleasures which he was anticipating from his Italian trip
   was the study of that portrait of one of the most vigorous--thatkräftig
   --of the popes.

   § 56. Leo X. 1513-1521.

   The warlike Julius II. was followed on the pontifical throne by the
   voluptuary, Leo X.,--the prelate whose iron will and candid mind compel
   admiration by a prince given to the pursuit of pleasure and an adept in
   duplicity. Leo loved ease and was without high aims. His Epicurean
   conception of the supreme office of Christendom was expressed in a
   letter he sent a short time after his election to his brother Julian.
   In it were these words, "Let us enjoy the papacy, for God has given it
   to us." [847] The last pontificate of the Middle Ages corresponded to
   the worldly philosophy of the pontiff. Leo wanted to have a good time.
   . The idea of a spiritual mission never entered his head. No effort was
   made, emanating from the Vatican, to further the interests of true
   religion.

   Born in Florence, Dec. 11, 1475, Giovanni de' Medici, the second son of
   Lorenzo the Magnificent, had every opportunity which family
   distinction, wealth and learned tutors, such as Poliziano, could give.
   At 7 he received the tonsure, and at once the world of ecclesiastical
   preferment was opened to the child. Louis XI. of France presented him
   with the abbey of Fonte Dolce, and at 8 he was nominated to the
   archbishopric of Aix, the nomination, however, not being confirmed. A
   canonry in each of the cathedral churches of Tuscany was set apart for
   him, and his appointments soon reached the number of 27, one of them
   being the abbacy of Monte Cassino, and another the office of papal
   pronotary. [848]

   The highest dignities of the Church were in store for the lad and,
   before he had reached the age of 14, he was made cardinal-deacon by
   Innocent VIII., March 9, 1489. Three years later, March 8, 1492,
   Giovanni received in Rome formal investment into the prerogatives of
   his office. The letter, which Lorenzo wrote on this latter occasion, is
   full of the affectionate counsels of a father and the prudent
   suggestions of the tried man of the world, and belongs in a category
   with the letters of Lord Chesterfield to his son. Lorenzo reminded
   Giovanni of his remarkable fortune in being made a prince of the
   church, all the more remarkable because he was not only the youngest
   member of the college of cardinals, but the first cardinal to receive
   the dignity at so tender an age. With pardonable pride, he spoke of it
   as the highest honor ever conferred upon the Medicean house. He warned
   his son that Rome was the sink of all iniquities and exhorted him to
   lead a virtuous life, to avoid ostentation, to rise early, an
   admonition the son never followed, and to use his opportunities to
   serve his native city. Lorenzo died a few months later. [849] Forthwith
   the young prelate was appointed papal legate to Tuscany, with residence
   in his native city.

   When Julius died, Giovanni de' Medici was only 37. In proceeding to
   Rome, he was obliged to be carried in a litter, on account of an ulcer
   for which an operation was performed during the meeting of the
   conclave. Giovanni, who belonged to the younger party, had won many
   friends by his affable manners and made no enemies, and his election
   seems to have been secured without any special effort on his part. The
   great-grandson of the banker, Cosimo, chose the name of Leo X. He was
   consecrated to the priesthood March 17, 1513, and to the episcopate
   March 19. The election was received by the Romans with every sign of
   popular approval. On the festivities of the coronation 100,000 ducats,
   or perhaps as much as 150,000 ducats, were expended, a sum which the
   frugality of Julius had stored up.

   The procession was participated in by 250 abbots, bishops and
   archbishops. Alfonso of Este, whom Julius II. had excommunicated, led
   the pope's white horse, the same one he had ridden the year before at
   Ravenna. On the houses and

   Pope Leo X

   on the arches, spanning the streets, might be seen side by side statues
   of Cosmas and Damian, the patrons of the Medicean house, and of the
   Olympian gods and nymphs. On one arch at the Piazza di Parione were
   depicted Perseus, Apollo, Moses and Mercury, sacred and mythological
   characters conjoined, as Alexander Severus joined the busts of Abraham
   and Orpheus in his palace in the third century. A bishop, afterwards
   Cardinal Andrea della Valle, placed on his arch none but ancient
   divinities, Apollo, Bacchus, Mercury, Hercules and Venus, together with
   fauns and Ganymede. Antonio of San Marino, the silversmith, decorated
   his house with a marble statue of Venus, under which were inscribed the
   words--


   Mars ruled; then Pallas, but Venus will rule forever. [850]

   As a ruler, Leo had none of the daring and strength of his predecessor.
   He pursued a policy of opportunism and stooped to the practice of
   duplicity with his allies as well as with his enemies. On all occasions
   he was ready to shift to the winning side. To counteract the designs of
   the French upon Northern Italy, he entered with Maximilian, Henry VIII.
   and Ferdinand of Spain into the treaty of Mechlin, April 5, 1513. He
   had the pleasure of seeing the French beaten by Henry VIII. at the
   battle of the Spurs [851] and again driven out of Italy by the bravery
   of the Swiss at Novara, June 6. Louis easily yielded to the pope's
   advances for peace and acknowledged the authority of the Lateran
   council. The deposed cardinals, Carvajal and Sanseverino, who had been
   active in the Pisan council, signed a humiliating confession and were
   reinstated. Leo remarked to them that they were like the sheep in the
   Gospel which was lost and was found. A secret compact, entered into
   between the pontiff and King Louis, and afterwards joined by Henry
   VIII., provided for the French king's marriage with Mary Tudor, Henry's
   younger sister, and the recognition of his claims in Northern Italy.
   But at the moment these negotiations were going on, Leo was secretly
   engaged in the attempt to divorce Venice from the French and to defeat
   the French plans for the reoccupation of Milan. Louis' career was
   suddenly cut short by death, Jan. 1, 1515, at the age of 52, three
   months after his nuptials with Mary, who was sixteen at the time of her
   marriage.

   The same month Leo came to an understanding with Maximilian and Spain,
   whereby Julian de' Medici, the pope's brother, should receive Parma,
   Piacenza and Reggio. Leo purchased Modena from the emperor for 40,000
   ducats, and was sending 60,000 ducats monthly for the support of the
   troops of his secret allies.

   At the very same moment, faithless to his Spanish allies, the pope was
   carrying on negotiations with Venice to drive them out of Italy.

   Louis' son-in-law and successor, Francis I., a warlike and enterprising
   prince, held the attention of Europe for nearly a quarter of a century
   with his campaigns against Charles V., whose competitor he was for the
   imperial crown. Carrying out Louis' plans, and accompanied by an army
   of 35,000 men with 60 cannon, he marched in the direction of Milan,
   inflicting at Marignano, Sept., 1515, a disastrous defeat upon the
   20,000 Swiss mercenaries. [852] At the first news of the disaster, Leo
   was thrown into consternation, but soon recovered his composure,
   exclaiming in the presence of the Venetian ambassador, "We shall have
   to put ourselves into the hands of the king and cry out for mercy." The
   victory, was the reply, "will not inure to your hurt or the damage of
   the Apostolic see. The French king is a son of the Church." And so it
   proved to be. Without a scruple, as it would seem, the pope threw off
   his alliances with the emperor and Ferdinand and hurried to get the
   best terms he could from Francis.

   They met at Bologna. Conducted by 20 cardinals, Francis entered Leo's
   presence and, uncovering his head, bowed three times and kissed the
   pontiff's hand and foot. Leo wore a tiara glittering with gems, and a
   mantle, heavy with cloth of gold. The French orator set forth how the
   French kings from time immemorial had been protectors of the Apostolic
   see, and how Francis had crossed the mountains and rivers to show his
   submission. For three days pontiff and king dwelt together in the same
   palace. It was agreed that Leo yield up Parma and Piacenza to the
   French, and a concordat was worked out which took the place of the
   Pragmatic Sanction. This document, dating from the Council of Basel,
   and ratified by the synod of Bourges, placed the nomination to all
   French bishoprics, abbeys and priories in the hands of the king, and
   this clause the concordat preserved. On the other hand, the clauses in
   the Pragmatic Sanction were omitted which made the pope subject to
   general councils and denied to him the right to collect annates from
   French benefices higher and lower.

   The election of a successor to the emperor Maximilian, who died Jan.,
   1519, put Leo's diplomacy to the severest test. Ferdinand the Catholic,
   who had seen the Moorish domination in Spain come to an end and the
   Americas annexed to his crown, and had been invested by Julius II. in
   1510 with the kingdom of Naples, died in 1516, leaving his grandson,
   Charles, heir to his dominions. Now, by the death of his paternal
   grandfather Maximilian, Charles was heir of the Netherlands and the
   lands of the Hapsburgs and natural claimant of the imperial crown. Leo
   preferred Francis, but Charles had the right of lineage and the support
   of the German people. To prevent Charles' election, and to avoid the
   ill-will of Francis, he agitated through his legate, Cajetan, the
   election of either Frederick the Wise, elector of Saxony, or the
   elector of Brandenburg. Secretly he entered into the plans of Francis
   and allowed the archbishops of Treves and Cologne to be assured of
   their promotion to the sacred college, provided they would cast their
   electoral vote for the French king. But to be sure of his ground, no
   matter who might be elected, Leo entered also into a secret agreement
   with Charles. Both candidates had equal reason for believing they had
   the pope on their side. [853] Finally, when it became evident that
   Francis was out of the race, and after the electors had already
   assembled in Frankfurt, Leo wrote to Cajetan that it was no use beating
   one's head against the wall and that he should fall in with the
   election of Charles. Leo had stipulated 100,000 ducats as the price of
   his support of Charles. [854] He sent a belated letter of
   congratulation to the emperor-elect, which was full of tropical
   phrases, and in 1521, at the Diet of Worms, the assembly before which
   Luther appeared, he concluded with Charles an alliance against his
   former ally, Francis. The agreement included the reduction of Milan,
   Parma and Piacenza. The news of the success of Charles' troops in
   taking these cities reached Leo only a short time before his death,
   Dec. 1, 1521. For the cause of Protestantism, the papal alliance with
   the emperor against France proved to be highly favorable, for it
   necessitated the emperor's absence from Germany.

   In his administration of the papacy, Leo X. was not unmindful of the
   interests of his family. Julian, his younger brother, was made
   gonfalonier of the Church, and was married to the sister of Francis
   I.'s mother. For a time he was in possession of Parma, Piacenza and
   Reggio. Death terminated his career, 1516. His only child, the
   illegitimate Hippolytus, d. 1535, was afterwards made cardinal.

   The worldly hopes of the Medicean dynasty now centred in Lorenzo de'
   Medici, the son of Leo's older brother. After the deposition of Julius'
   nephew, he was invested with the duchy of Urbino. In 1518 he was
   married to Madeleine de la Tour d'Auvergne, a member of the royal house
   of France. Leo's presents to the marital pair were valued at 300,000
   ducats, among them being a bedstead of tortoise-shell inlaid with
   mother-of-pearl and precious stones. They took up their abode at
   Florence, but both husband and wife died a year after the marriage,
   leaving behind them a daughter who, as Catherine de' Medici, became
   famous in the history of France and the persecution of the Huguenots.
   With Lorenzo's death, the last descendant of the male line of the house
   founded by Cosimo de' Medici became extinct.

   In 1513 Leo admitted his nephew, Innocent Cibo, and his cousin, Julius,
   to the sacred college. Innocent Cibo, a young man of 21, was the son of
   Franceschetto Cibo, Innocent VIII.'s son, and Maddelina de' Medici,
   Leo's sister. His low morals made him altogether unfit for an
   ecclesiastical dignity. Julius de' Medici, afterwards Clement VII., was
   the bastard son of Leo's uncle, who was killed in the Pazzi conspiracy
   under Sixtus IV., 1478. The impediment of the illegitimate birth was
   removed by a papal decree. [855] Two nephews, Giovanni Salviati and
   Nicolas Ridolfi, sons of two of Leo's sisters, were also vested with
   the red hat, 1517. On this occasion Leo appointed no less than
   thirty-one cardinals. Among them were Cajetan, the learned general of
   the Dominicans, Aegidius of Viterbo, who had won an enviable fame by
   his address opening the Lateran council, and Adrian of Utrecht, Leo's
   successor in the papal chair. Of the number was Alfonso of Portugal, a
   child of 7, but it was understood he was not to enter upon the duties
   of his office till he had reached the age of 14. Among the other
   appointees were princes entirely unworthy of any ecclesiastical office.
   [856]

   The Vatican was thrown into a panic in 1517 by a conspiracy directed by
   Cardinal Petrucci of Siena, one of the younger set of cardinals with
   whom the pope had been intimate. Embittered by Leo's interference in
   his brother's administration of Siena and by the deposition of the duke
   of Urbino, Petrucci plotted to have the pope poisoned by a physician,
   Battesta de Vercelli, a specialist on ulcers. The plot was discovered,
   and Petrucci, who came to Rome on a safe-conduct procured from the pope
   by the Spanish ambassador, was cast into the Marroco, the deepest
   dungeon of S. Angelo. On being reminded of the safe-conduct, Leo
   replied to the ambassador that no one was safe who was a poisoner.
   Cardinals Sauli and Riario were entrapped and also thrown into the
   castle-dungeons. Two other cardinals were suspected of being in the
   plot, but escaped. Petrucci and the physician were strangled to death;
   Riario and Sauli were pardoned. Riario, who had witnessed the dastardly
   assassination in the cathedral of Florence 40 years before, was the
   last prominent representative of the family of Sixtus IV. Torture
   brought forth the confession that the plotters contemplated making him
   pope. Leo set the price of the cardinal's absolution high,--150,000
   ducats to be paid in a year, and another 150,000 to be paid by his
   relatives in case Riario left his palace. He finally secured the pope's
   permission to leave Rome, and died, 1521, at Naples.

   One of the sensational pageants which occurred during Leo's pontificate
   was on the arrival of a delegation from Portugal, 1514, to announce to
   the pope the obedience of its king, Emmanuel. The king sent a large
   number of presents, among them horses from Persia, a young panther, two
   leopards and a white elephant. The popular jubilation over the
   procession of the wild beasts reached its height when the elephant,
   taking water into his proboscis, spurted it over the onlookers. [857]
   In recognition of the king's courtesy, the pope vested in Portugal all
   the lands west of Capes Bojador and Non to the Indies.

   The Fifth Lateran resumed its sessions in April, 1513, a month after
   Leo's election. The council ratified the concordat with France, and at
   the 8th session, Dec. 19, 1513, solemnly affirmed the doctrine of the
   soul's immortality. [858] The affirmation was called forth by the
   scepticism of the Arabic philosophers and the Italian pantheists. A
   single vote recorded against the decree came from the bishop of
   Bergamo, who took the ground that it is not the business of theologians
   to spend their time sitting in judgment upon the theories of
   philosophers.

   The invention of printing was recognized by the council as a gift from
   heaven intended for the glory of God and the propagation of good
   science, but the legitimate printing of books was restricted to such as
   might receive the sanction of the master of the palace in Rome or,
   elsewhere, by the sanction of the bishop or inquisitors who were
   charged with examining the contents of books. [859] The condemnation of
   all books, distasteful to the hierarchy, was already well under way.

   The council approved the proposed Turkish crusade and levied a tenth on
   Christendom. Its collection was forbidden in England by Henry VIII.
   Cajetan presented the cause in an eloquent address at the Diet of
   Augsburg, 1518. Altogether the most significant of the council's
   deliverances was the bull, Pater aeternus, labelled as approved by its
   authority and sent out by Leo, 1516. [860] Here the position is
   reaffirmed--the position taken definitely by Pius II. and Sixtus
   IV.--that it is given to the Roman pontiff to have authority over all
   Church councils and to appoint, transfer and dissolve them at will.
   This famous deliverance expressly renewed and ratified the constitution
   of Boniface VIII., the Unam sanctam, asserting it to be altogether
   necessary to salvation for all Christians to be subject to the Roman
   pontiff. [861] To this was added the atrocious declaration that
   disobedience to the pope is punishable with death. Innocent III. had
   quoted Deut. 17:12 in favor of this view, falsifying the translation of
   the Vulgate, which he made to read, "that whoever does not submit
   himself to the judgment of the high-priest, him shall the judge put to
   death." The council, in separating the quotations, falsely derived it
   from the Book of the Kings. [862]

   Nor should it be overlooked that in his bull the infallible Leo X.
   certified to a falsehood when he expressly declared that the Fathers,
   in the ancient councils, in order to secure confirmation for their
   decrees, "humbly begged the pope's approbation." This he affirmed of
   the councils of Nice, 325, Ephesus, Chalcedon, Constantinople, 680, and
   Nice, 787. 214 years before, when Boniface VIII. issued his bull,
   Philip the Fair was at hand to resist it. The French sovereign now on
   the throne, Francis I., made no dissent. The concordat had just been
   ratified by the council.

   The council adjourned March 16, 1517, a bare majority of two votes
   being for adjournment. Writers of Gallican sympathies have denied its
   oecumenical character. On the other hand, Cardinal Hergenröther regrets
   that the Church has taken a position to it of a stepmother to her
   child. Pastor says there was already legislation enough before the
   Fifth Lateran sat to secure all the reforms needed. Not laws but action
   was required. Funk expresses the truth when he says, what the council
   did for Church reform is hardly worth noting down. [863]

   In passing judgment upon Leo X., the chief thing to be said is that he
   was a worldling. Religion was not a serious matter with him. Pleasure
   was his daily concern, not piety. He gave no earnest thought to the
   needs of the Church. It would scarcely be possible to lay more stress
   upon this feature in the life of Louis XIV., or Charles II., than does
   Pastor in his treatment of Leo's career. Reumont [864] says it did not
   enter Leo's head that it was the task and duty of the papacy to
   regenerate itself, and so to regenerate Christendom. Leo's personal
   habits are not a matter of conjecture. They lie before us in a number
   of contemporary descriptions. In his reverend regard for the papal
   office, Luther did Leo an unintentional injustice when he compared him
   to Daniel among the lions. The pope led the cardinals in the pursuit of
   pleasure and in extravagance in the use of money. To one charge,
   unchasteness, Leo seems not to have exposed himself. How far this was a
   virtue, or how far it was forced upon him by nature, cannot be said.

   The qualities, with which nature endowed him, remained with him to the
   end. He was good-humored, affable and accessible. He was often found
   playing chess or cards with his cardinals. At the table he was usually
   temperate, though he spent vast sums in the entertainment of others. He
   kept a monk capable of swallowing a pigeon at one mouthful and 40 eggs
   at a sitting. To his dress he gave much attention, and delighted to
   adorn his fingers with gems.

   The debt art owes to Leo X. may be described in another place. Rome
   became what Paris afterwards was, the centre of luxury, art and
   architectural improvement. The city grew with astonishing rapidity.
   "New buildings," said an orator, "are planted every day. Along the
   Tiber and on the Janicular hill new sections arise." Luigi Gradenigo,
   the Venetian ambassador, reports that in the ten years following Leo's
   election, 10,000 buildings had been put up by persons from Northern
   Italy. The palaces of bankers, nobles and cardinals were filled with
   the richest furniture of the world. Artists were drawn from France and
   Spain as well as Italy, and every kind of personality who could afford
   amusement to others.

   The Vatican was the resort of poets, musicians, artists, and also of
   actors and buffoons. Leo joined in their conversation and laughed at
   their wit. He even vied with the poets in making verses off-hand.
   Musical instruments ornamented with gold and silver he purchased in
   Germany. With almost Oriental abandon he allowed himself to be charmed
   with entertainments of all sorts.

   Among Leo's amusements the chase took a leading place, though it was
   forbidden by canonical law to the clergy. Fortunately for his
   reputation, he was not bound, as pope, by canon law. As Louis XIV.
   said, "I am the state," so the pope might have said, "I am the canon
   law." Portions of the year he passed booted and spurred. He fished in
   the lake of Bolsena and other waters. He takes an inordinate pleasure
   in the chase, wrote the Venetian ambassador. He hunted in the woods of
   Viterbo and Nepi and in the closer vicinity of Rome, but with most
   pleasure at his hunting villa, Magliana. He reserved for his own use a
   special territory. The hunting parties were often large. [865] At a
   meet, prepared by Alexander Farnese, the pope found himself in the
   midst of 18 cardinals, besides other prelates, musicians, actors and
   servants. A pack of sixty or seventy dogs aided the hunters. Magliana
   was five miles from Rome, on the Tiber. This favorite pleasure castle
   is now a desolate farmhouse. In strange contrast to his own practice,
   the pope, at the appeal of the king of Portugal, forbade the privileges
   of the chase to the Portuguese clergy.

   The theatre was another passion to which Leo devoted himself. He
   attended plays in the palaces of the cardinals and rich bankers and in
   S. Angelo, and looked on as they were performed in the Vatican itself.
   Bibbiena, one of the favorite members of his cabinet, was a writer of
   salacious comedies. One of these, the Calandria, Leo witnessed
   performed in 1514 in his palace. The ballet was freely danced in some
   of these plays, as in the lascivious Suppositi by Ariosto, played
   before the pope in S. Angelo on Carnival Sunday. Another of the plays
   was the Mandragola, by Machiavelli, to modern performances of which in
   Florence young people are not admitted. [866] An account given of one
   of these plays by the ambassador of Ferrara, Paolucci, represented a
   girl pleading with Venus for a lover. At once, eight monks appeared on
   the scene in their gray mantles. Venus bade the girl give them a
   potion. Amor then awoke the sleepers with his arrow. The monks danced
   round Amor and made love to the girl. At last they threw aside their
   monastic garb and all joined in a moresca. On the girl's asking what
   they could do with their arms, they fell to fighting, and all succumbed
   except one, and he received the girl as the prize of his prowess. [867]
   And Leo was the high-priest of Christendom, the professed successor of
   Peter the Apostle!

   Festivities of all sorts attracted the attention of the good-natured
   pope. With 14 cardinals he assisted at the marriage of the rich Sienese
   banker, Agostino Chigi, to his mistress. The entertainment was given at
   Chigi's beautiful house, the Farnesina. This man was considered the
   most fortunate banker of his day in Rome. The kings of Spain and France
   and princes of Germany sent him presents, and sought from him loans.
   Even the sultan was said to have made advances for his friendship. His
   income was estimated at 70,000 ducats a year, and he left behind him
   800,000 ducats. This Croesus was only fifty-five when death separated
   him from his fortune. At one of his banquets, the gold plates were
   thrown through the windows into the Tiber after they were used at the
   table, but fortunately they were saved from loss by being caught in a
   net which had been prepared for them. On another occasion, when Leo and
   18 cardinals were present, each found his own coat-of-arms on the
   silver dishes he used. At Agostino's marriage festival, Leo held the
   bride's hand while she received the ring on one of her fingers. The
   pontiff then baptized one of Chigi's illegitimate children. Cardinals
   were not ashamed to dine with representatives of the demi-monde, as at
   a banquet given by the banker Lorenzo Strozzi. [868] But in scandals of
   this sort Alexander's pontificate could not well be outdone.

   With the easy unconcern of a child of the world, spoiled by fortune,
   the light-hearted de' Medici went on his way as if the resources of the
   papal treasury were inexhaustible. Julius was a careful financier.
   Leo's finances were managed by incompetent favorites. [869] In 1517 his
   annual income is estimated to have been nearly 600,000 ducats. Of this
   royal sum, 420,000 ducats were drawn from state revenues and mines. The
   alum deposits at Tolfa yielded 40,000; Ravenna and the salt mines of
   Cervia, 60,000; the river rents in Rome, 60,000; and the papal domains
   of Spoleto, Ancona and the Romagna, 150,000. According to another
   contemporary, the papal exchequer received 160,000 ducats from
   ecclesiastical sources. The vendable offices at the pope's disposal at
   the time of his death numbered 2,150, yielding the enormous yearly
   income of 328,000 ducats. [870]

   Two years after Leo assumed the pontificate, the financial problem was
   already a serious one. All sorts of measures had to be invented to
   increase the papal revenues and save the treasury from hopeless
   bankruptcy. By augmenting the number of the officials of the
   Tiber--porzionari di ripa -- from 141 to 612, 286,000 ducats were
   secured. The enlargement of the colleges of the cubiculari and
   scudieri, officials of the Vatican, brought in respectively 90,000 and
   112,000 ducats more. From the erection of the order of the Knights of
   St. Peter,--cavalieri di San Pietro,--with 401 members, the
   considerable sum of 400,000 ducats was realized, 1,000 ducats from each
   knight. The sale of indulgences did not yield what it once did, but the
   revenue from this source was still large. [871] The highest
   ecclesiastical offices were for sale, as in the reign of Alexander.
   Cardinal Innocent Cibo paid 30,000 ducats or, at; another report went,
   40,000, for his hat, and Francesco Armellini bought his for twice that
   amount. [872]

   The shortages were provided for by resort to the banker and the usurer
   and to rich cardinals. Loan followed loan. Not only were the tapestries
   of the Vatican and the silver plate given as securities, but
   ecclesiastical benefices, the gems of the papal tiara and the rich
   statues of the saints were put in pawn. Sometimes the pope paid 20 per
   cent for sums of 10,000 ducats and over. [873] It occasions no surprise
   that Leo's death was followed by a financial collapse, and a number of
   cardinals passed into bankruptcy, including Cardinal Pucci, who had
   lent the pope 150,000 ducats. From the banker, Bernado Bini, Leo had
   gotten 200,000 ducats. His debts were estimated as high as 800,000
   ducats. It was a common joke that Leo squandered three pontificates,
   the legacy Julius left and the revenues of his successor's pontificate,
   as well as the income of his own.

   For the bankers and all sorts of money dealers the Medicean period was
   a flourishing time in Rome. No less than 30 Florentines are said to
   have opened banking institutions in the city, and, at the side of the
   Fuggers and Welsers, did business with the curia. The Florentines found
   it to be a good thing to have a Medicean pope, and swarmed about the
   Vatican as the Spaniards had done in the good days of Calixtus III. and
   Alexander VI., the Sienese, during the reign of Pius II., and the
   Ligurians while Sixtus IV. of Savona was pope. They stormed the gates
   of patronage, as if all the benefices of the Church were intended for
   them. [874]

   Leo's father, Lorenzo, said of his three sons that Piero was a fool,
   Giuliano was good and Giovanni shrewd. The last characterization was
   true to the facts. Leo X. was shrewd, the shrewdness being of the kind
   that succeeds in getting temporary personal gain, even though it be by
   the sacrifice of high and accessible ends. His amiability and polish of
   manners made him friends and secured for him the tiara. He was not
   altogether a degenerate personality like Alexander VI., capable of all
   wickedness. But his outlook never went beyond his own pleasures. The
   Vatican was the most luxurious court in Europe; it performed no moral
   service for the world. The love of art with Leo was the love of color,
   of outline, of beauty such as a Greek might have had, not a taste
   controlled by regard for spiritual grace and aims. In his treatment of
   the European states and the Italian cities, his diplomacy was marked by
   dissimulation as despicable as any that was practised by secular
   courts. Without a scruple be could solemnly make at the same moment
   contradictory pledges. Perfidy seemed to be as natural to him as
   breath. [875]

   At the same time, Leo followed the rubrics of religion. He fasted, so
   it is reported, three times a week, abstained from meat on Wednesday
   and Friday, daily read his Breviary and was accustomed before mass to
   seek absolution from his confessor. But he was without sanctity,
   without deep religious conviction. The issues of godliness had no
   appreciable effect upon him in the regulation of his habits. Even in
   his patronage of art and culture, he forgot or ignored Ariosto,
   Machiavelli, Guicciardini and Erasmus. What a noble substitution it
   would have been, if these men had found welcome in the Vatican, and the
   jesters and buffoons and gormandizers been relegated to their proper
   place! The high-priest of the Christian world is not to be judged in
   the same terms we would apply to a worldly prince ruling in the closing
   years of the Middle Ages. The Vatican, Leo turned into a house of
   revelling and frivolity, the place of all others where the step and the
   voice of the man of God should have been heard. The Apostle, whom he
   had been taught to regard as his spiritual ancestor, accomplished his
   mission by readiness to undergo, if necessary, martyrdom. Leo despoiled
   his high office of its sacredness and prostituted it into a vehicle of
   his own carnal propensities. Had he followed the advice of his princely
   father, man of the world though he was, Leo X. would have escaped some
   of the reprobation which attaches to his name.

   There is no sufficient evidence that Leo ever used the words ascribed
   to him, "how profitable that fable of Christ has been to us." [876]
   Such blasphemy we prefer not to associate with the de' Medici.
   Nevertheless, no sharper condemnation of one claiming to be Christ's
   vicar on earth could well be thought of than that which is carried by
   the words of Sarpi, the Catholic historian of the Council of Trent,
   [877] who said, "Leo would have been a perfect pope, if he had combined
   with his other good qualities a moderate knowledge of religion and a
   greater inclination to piety, for neither of which he shewed much
   concern." Before Leo's death, the papacy had lost a part of its
   European constituency, and that part which, in the centuries since, has
   represented the furthest progress of civilization. The bull which this
   pontiff hurled at Martin Luther, 1520, was consumed into harmless ashes
   at Wittenberg, ashes which do not speak forth from the earth as do the
   ashes of John Huss. To the despised Saxon miner's son, the Protestant
   world looks back for the assertion of the right to study the
   Scriptures, a matter of more importance than all the circumstance and
   rubrics of papal office and sacerdotal functions. Not seldom has it
   occurred that the best gifts to mankind have come, not through a long
   heritage of prerogatives but through the devotion of some agent of God
   humbly born. It seemed as if Providence allowed the papal office at the
   close of the mediaeval age to be filled by pontiffs spiritually
   unworthy and morally degenerate, that it might be known for all time
   that it was not through the papacy the Church was to be reformed and
   brought out of its mediaeval formalism and scholasticism. What popes
   had refused to attempt, another group of men with no distinction of
   office accomplished.

   [847] These words are upon the testimony of the contemporary
   ambassador, Marino Giorgi, and cannot be set aside. Similar testimony
   is given by a biographer of Leo in Cod. Vat., 3920, which Döllinger
   quotes, Papstthum, p. 484, and which runs volo ut pontificatu isto quam
   maxime perfruamur. Pastor, IV. 353, while trying to break the force of
   the testimony for Leo's words, pronounces the love of pleasure a
   fundamental and insatiable element of his nature--eine unersättliche
   Vergügungssucht, etc. Hefele-Knöpfler, Kirchengesch., p. 488, speak in
   the same vein when they say, Des neuen Papstes vorzüglichstes Streben
   galt heiterem Lebensgenuss, etc.

   [849] The famous letter is given by Roscoe, Bohn's ed., pp. 285-288,
   and Vaughan, p. 23 sqq.

   [850] See Schulte, p. 198 sq., and Reumont, III., part II., p. 67. In
   front of the house of the banker, Agostino Chigi, were seen two persons
   representing Apollo and Mercury, and two little Moors, together with
   the inscription-- Olim habuit Cypria sua tempora, tempora Mavors Olim
   habuit, sua nunc tempora Pallas habet. The goddess of Cyprus had her
   day and also Mars, But now Minerva reigns.

   [851] August 15, 1513. The Scotch king, James IV., who had married
   Henry's sister, Margaret, joined the French. The memorable defeat at
   Flodden followed, Sept. 9, 1513. James and the flower of the Scotch
   nobility fell. Leo recognized Henry's victories by conferring upon him
   the consecrated sword and hat which it was the pope's custom to set
   aside on Christmas day.

   [852] The battle is vividly described by D. J. Dierauer, Gesch. der
   schweizerischen Eidgenossenschaft, 2 vols., Gotha, 1892, vol. II. 451
   sqq. On the second day of the battle, the arrival of the Venetian
   troops gave victory to the French. Of the 12,000 left on the field
   dead, the most were Swiss. Before entering the battle, as was their
   custom, the mountaineers engaged in prayer, and the leader, Steiner of
   Zug, after repeating the usual formula of devotion unto death, threw,
   in the name of the Trinity, a handful of earth over his
   fellow-soldiers' heads.

   [853] Pastor, IV. 185 sq., strongly condemns Leo's two-tongued
   diplomacy, doppelzüngiges Verhalten. Leo's brief, authorizing Francis
   to make a promise of red hats to the two archbishops, is dated March
   12, 1519.

   [854] One-half was to be paid in cash and the other half to be
   deposited with the Fuggers, Schulte, p. 196.

   [855] The investigation, started by Leo, resulted in making it appear
   that Julius' mother, Floreta, and his father had agreed to regard
   themselves as married, though a formal service was wanting.

   [856] Silvio Passerini, one of the fortunate candidates, was a prince
   of benefice-hunters. Pastor, IV. 139, gives fifty-five notices of
   benefices bestowed on him from Leo's Regesta. He calls the list of the
   places he received as wahrhaft erschreckend, "something terrifying."

   [857] The elephant became the subject of quite an extensive literature,
   poets joining others in setting forth his peculiarities. See Pastor,
   IV. 52, Note.

   [858] The concordat met with serious resistance in France both from
   parliament and the University of Paris on the ground that it set aside
   the decisions of the Councils of Constance and Basel on the question of
   conciliar authority, and thus overthrew the Gallican liberties. The
   rector of the university forbade the university printer issuing the
   document, but he was brought to time by Leo instructing his legate to
   pronounce censure against him and the university, who "thinking
   themselves to be wise, had become fools."

   of Leo's hunting expeditions, speaks of his passion for the chase as
   his leidenschaftliche Jagdliebhaberei

   [867] See Reumont, III, Part II., 134 sq.

   [868] Sanuto, as quoted by Pastor, IV. 384. For some of the
   entertainments given by Cardinal Riario Cornaro, see Vaughan, p. 186
   sqq. At one of the banquets given by Cardinal Cornaro, sixty-five
   courses were served, three dishes to each course, and all served on
   silver. Such devices as a huge pie, from which blackbirds or
   nightingales flew forth, or dishes of peacocks' tails, or a
   construction of pastry from which a child would emerge to say a
   piece,--these were some of the inventions prepared for the amusement of
   guests at the tables of members of the sacred college.

   [869] Vettori, a contemporary, as quoted by Villari, IV. 4, says, "It
   was no more possible for his Holiness to keep 1,000 ducats than it is
   for a stone to fly upwards of itself." Villari, IV. 45, gives a list of
   Leo's enormous debts.

   [870] These two lists of figures are taken from the Venetian
   ambassadors, Giorgi and Gradenigo. Schulte, Die Fugger, p. 97 sq.,
   gives many cases of the payment of annates and the servitia through the
   Fuggers.

   [871] Schulte, I. 174, 223 sqq.

   [872] Pastor, IV. 368, has said, Um Geld herbeizuschaffen schreckte man
   vor keinem Mittel zurück. Döllinger, Papstthum, p. 485, quotes a
   contemporary as saying ea tempestate Romae, sacra omnia venalia erant,
   etc.

   [873] These figures are given by Schulte, I. 224-227, upon the basis of
   Sanuto and other contemporary writers. The iII odor of usury was
   avoided by representing the charges of the bankers as gifts.

   [874] Pastor, IV. 371, in his striking way says,Der Zudrang der
   Florentiner in der ersten Zeit dieses Pontificats war ein enormer. Die
   Begehrlichkeit dieser Leute war grenzenlos. The Fuggers, who carried on
   the most extensive dealings with the papal treasury and the sacred
   college, had been firmly established in Rome since the beginning of
   Alexander VI.'s pontificate. They came originally from Langen to
   Augsburg, where they started business as weavers, and then branched off
   into trading in spices and other commodities reaching Europe through
   Venice, and in copper and other metals, under the name of Ulrich Fugger
   and Brothers (George and Jacob), and their capital, estimated by the
   taxes they paid, increased, between 1480 and 1501, 1,634 per cent.
   Schulte, p. 3. After its transfer to Rome, the house became the
   depository of the papal treasurer and cardinals, and was the
   intermediary for the payment of annates and servitia to the papal and
   camera treasuries. The amounts, as furnished in the ledger entries, are
   given by Schulte.

   [875] See Pastor's terrific indictment, IV. 359 sq.

   [876] Quantum nobis nostrisque ea de Christo fabula profuerit, satis
   est omnibus saeculis notum. The words, said to have been spoken to
   Cardinal Bembo, were noted down for the first time by Bale in his
   Pageant of the Popes, ed. 1574, p. 179. Bale, bishop of Ossory, had
   been a Carmelite.

   Dr. Lea's elaborate work is the leading modern treatment of the subject
   and is accepted as an authority In Germany. See Benrath in Lit-Zeitung,
   1908, pp. 203-210. The author has brought out as never before the
   prominent part the confiscation of property played in the Spanish
   tribunal. The work of Abbé Vacandard, the author of the Life of St.
   Bernard, takes up the positions laid down in Dr. Lea's general work on
   the Inquisition and attempts to break the force of his statements.
   Vacandard admits the part taken by the papacy in prosecuting heresy by
   trial torture and even by the death penalty, but reduces the Church's
   responsibility on the ground of the ideas prevailing in the Middle
   Ages, and the greater freedom and cruelty practised by the state upon
   its criminals. He denies that Augustine favored severe measures of
   compulsion against heretics and sets forth, without modification, the
   unrelenting treatment of Thomas Aquinas.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 58. Heretical and Unchurchly Movements.

   In the 14th and 15th centuries, the seat of heresy was shifted from
   Southern France and Northern Italy to Bohemia and Northern Germany, the
   Netherlands and England. In Northern and Central Europe, the papal
   Inquisition, which had been so effective in exterminating the
   Albigenses and in repressing or scattering the Waldenses, entered upon
   a new period of its history, in seeking to crush out a new enemy of the
   Church, witchcraft. The rise and progress of the two most powerful and
   promising forms of popular heresy, Hussitism and Lollardy, have already
   been traced. Other sectarists who came under the Church's ban were the
   Beghards and Beguines, who had their origin in the 13th century, [878]
   the Brethren of the Free Spirit, the Fraticelli, the Flagellants and
   the Waldenses.

   It is not possible to state with exactness the differences between the
   Beghards, Beguines, the Brethren of the Free Spirit and the Fraticelli
   as they appeared from 1300 to 1500. The names were often used
   interchangeably as a designation of foes of the established Church
   order. [879] The court records and other notices that have come down to
   us indicate that they were represented in localities widely separated,
   and excited alarm which neither their numbers nor the station of their
   adherents justified. The orthodox mind was easily thrown into a panic
   over the deviations from the Church's system of doctrine and
   government. The distribution of the dissenters proves that a widespread
   religious unrest was felt in Western Christendom. They may have imbibed
   some elements from Joachim of Flore's millenarianism, and in a measure
   partook of the same spirit as German mysticism. There was a spiritual
   hunger the Church's aristocratic discipline and its priestly
   ministrations did not satisfy. The Church authorities had learned no
   other method of dealing with heresy than the method in vogue in the
   days of Innocent III. and Innocent IV., and sought, as before, by
   imprisonments, the sword and fire, to prevent its predatory ravages.

   The Brethren of the Free Spirit [880] were infected with pantheistic
   notions and manifested a tendency now to free thought, now to
   libertinism of conduct. At times they are identified with the Beghards
   and Beguines. The pantheistic element suggests a connection with Amaury
   of Bena or Meister Eckart, but of this the extant records of trials
   furnish no distinct evidence. To the Beghards and Beguines likewise
   were ascribed pantheistic tenets.

   To the general class of free thinkers belonged such individuals as
   Margaret of Henegouwen, usually known as Margaret of Porete, a Beguine,
   who wrote a book advocating the annihilation of the soul in God's love,
   and affirmed that, when this condition is reached, the individual may,
   without qualm of conscience, yield to any indulgence the appetites of
   nature call for. After having several times relapsed from the faith,
   she was burnt, together with her books, in the Place de Grève, Paris,
   1310. [881] Here belong also the Men of Reason,--homines
   intelligentiae,--who appeared at Brussels early in the 14th century and
   were charged with teaching the final restoration of all men and of the
   devil. [882]

   The Fraticelli, also called the Fratricelli,--the Little
   Brothers,--represented the opposite tendency and went to an extravagant
   excess in insisting upon a rigid observance of the rule of poverty.
   Originally followers of the Franciscan Observants, Peter Olivi, Michael
   Cesena and Angelo Clareno, they offered violent resistance to the
   decrees of John XXII., which ascribed to Christ and the Apostles the
   possession of property. Some were given shelter in legitimate
   Franciscan convents, while others associated themselves in schismatic
   groups of their own. They were active in Italy and Southern France, and
   were also represented in Holland and even in Egypt and Syria, as
   Gregory XI., 1375, declared; but it would be an error to regard their
   number as large. In his bull, Sancta romana, issued in 1317, John XXII.
   spoke of "men of the profane multitude, popularly called Fraticelli, or
   brethren of the poor life, Bizochi or Beguines or known by other
   names." This was not the first use of the term in an offensive sense.
   Villani called two men Fraticelli, a mechanic of Parma, Segarelli and
   his pupil Dolcino of Novara, both of whom were burnt, Segarelli in 1300
   and Dolcino some time later. Friar Bonato, head of a small Spiritual
   house in Catalonia, after being roasted on one side, proffered
   repentance and was released, but afterwards, 1335, burnt alive. [883]
   Wherever the Fraticelli appeared, they were pursued by the Inquisition.
   A number of bulla of the 14th century attacked them for denying the
   papal edicts and condemned them to rigorous prosecution. A formula,
   which they were required to profess, ran as follows: "I swear that I
   believe in my heart and profess that our Lord Jesus Christ and his
   Apostles, while in mortal life, held in common the things the
   Scriptures describe them as having and that they had the right of
   giving, selling and alienating them."

   In localities they seem to have carried their opposition to the Church
   so far as to set up a hierarchy of their own. [884] The regular priests
   they denounced as simonists and adulterers. In places they were held in
   such esteem by the populace that the Inquisition and the civil courts
   found themselves powerless to bring them to trial. Nine were burnt
   under Urban V. at Viterbo, and in 1389 Fra Michaele Berti de Calci, who
   had been successful in making converts, met the same fate at Florence.
   In France also they yielded victims to the flames, among them, Giovanni
   da Castiglione and Francese d'Arquata at Montpellier, 1354, and Jean of
   Narbonne and Maurice at Avignon. These enthusiasts are represented as
   having met death cheerfully.

   Early in the 15th century, we find the Fraticelli again the victims of
   the Inquisition. In 1424 and 1426, Martin V. ordered proceedings
   against certain of their number in Florence and in Spain. The vigorous
   propaganda of the papal preachers, John of Capistrano and James of the
   Mark, succeeded in securing the return of many of these heretics to the
   Church, but, as late as the reign of Paul II., 1466, they were
   represented in Rome, where six of their number were imprisoned and
   subjected to torture. The charges against them were the denial of the
   validity of papal decrees of indulgence other than the Portiuncula
   decree. [885] In Northern Europe the Fraticelli were classified with
   the Lollards and Beghards or identified with these heretics. The term,
   however, occurs seldom. Walter, the Lollard, was styled, the most
   wicked heresiarch of the Fraticelli, a man full of the devil and most
   perverse in his errors." [886]

   Of far more interest to this age are the Flagellants who attracted
   attention by the strange outward demonstrations in which their
   religious fervor found expression. Theirs was a militant Christianity.
   They made an attempt to do something. They correspond more closely to
   the Salvation Army of the 19th century than any other organization of
   the Middle Ages. There is no record that the beating of drums played
   any part in the movement, but they used popular songs, a series of
   distinctive physical gestures and peculiar vociferations, uniforms and
   some of the discipline of the camp. Their campaigns were penitential
   crusades in which the self-mortifications of the monastery were
   transferred to the open field and the public square, and were adapted
   to impress the impenitent to make earnest in the warfare against the
   passions of the flesh. The Flagellants buffeted the body if they did
   not always buffet Satan.

   An account has already been given of the first outbreak of the
   enthusiasm in Italy in 1259, which, starting in Perugia, spread to
   Northern Italy and extended across the Alps to Austria, Prag and
   Strassburg. [887] Similar outbreaks occurred in 1296, 1333, 1349, 1399,
   and again at the time of the Spanish evangelist, Vincent Ferrer.

   From being regarded as harmless fanatics they came to be treated as
   disturbers of the ecclesiastical peace, and in Northern Europe were
   classed with Beghards, Lollards, Hussites and other unchurchly or
   heretical sectarists.

   The movement of 1333 was led by an eloquent Dominican, Venturino of
   Bergamo, and is described at length by Villani. Ten thousand followed
   this leader, wearing head-bands inscribed with the monogram of Christ,
   IHS, and on their chests a dove with an olive-branch in her mouth.
   Venturino led his followers as far as Rome and preached on the
   Capitoline. The penniless enthusiasts soon became a laughing-stock, and
   Venturino, on going to Avignon, gained absolution and died in Smyrna,
   1346.

   The earlier exhibitions of Flagellant zeal were as dim candlelights
   compared with the outbursts of 1349, during the ravages of the Black
   Death, which in contemporary chronicles and the Flagellant codes was
   called the great death--das grosse Sterben, pestis grandis, mortalitas
   magna. Bands of religious campaigners suddenly appeared in nearly all
   parts of Latin Christendom, Hungary, Bohemia, Italy, France, Germany
   and the Netherlands. John du Fayt, preaching before Clement VI.,
   represented them as spread through all parts--per omnes provincias--and
   their numbers as countless. The exact numbers of the separate bands are
   repeatedly given, as they appeared in Ghent, Tournay, Dort, Bruges,
   Liége and other cities. [888] Even bishops and princes took part in
   them. There were also bands of women.

   Our knowledge of the German and Lowland Flagellants is most extensive.
   While the accounts of chroniclers differ in details, they agree in the
   main features. The Flagellants clad themselves in white and wore on
   their mantles, before and behind, and on their caps, a red cross, from
   which they got the name, the Brothers of the Cross. They marched from
   place to place, stopping only a single day and night at one locality,
   except in case of Sunday, when they often made an exception. In the van
   of their processions were carried crosses and banners. They sang hymns
   as they marched. The public squares in front of churches and fields,
   near-by towns, were chosen for their encampments and disciplinary
   drill, which was repeated twice a day with bodies bared to the waist. A
   special feature was the reading of a letter which, so it was asserted,
   was originally written on a table of stone and laid by an angel on the
   altar of St. Peter's in Jerusalem. [889] It represented Christ as
   indignant at the world's wickedness, and, more especially, at the
   desecration of Sunday and the prevalence of usury and adultery, but as
   promising mercy on condition that the Flagellants gather and make
   pilgrimages of penance lasting 33½ days, a period corresponding to the
   years of his earthly life.

   The letter being read, the drill began in earnest. It consisted of
   their falling on their knees and on the ground three times, in
   scourging themselves and in certain significant gestures to indicate to
   what sin each had been specially addicted. Every soldier carried a
   whip, or scourge, which, as writers are careful to report, was tipped
   with pieces of iron. These were often so sharp as to justify their
   comparison to needles, and the blood was frequently seen trickling down
   the bodies of the more zealous, even to their loins. [890] The blows
   were executed to the rhythmic music of hymns, and the ruddy militiamen,
   milites rubicundi,--as they were sometimes called, believed that the
   blood which they shed was one with Christ's blood or was mixed with it.
   They found a patron in St. Paul, whose stigmata they thought of, not as
   scars of conscience but bodily wounds. [891] At each genuflection they
   sang a hymn, four hymns being sung during the progress of a drill. The
   first calling to the drill began with the words: --


   Nun tretet herzu wer buesen welle

   Fliehen wir die heisse Hölle.

   Lucifer ist bös Geselle

   Wen er habet mit Pech er ihn labet.

   Darum fliehen wir mit ihm zu sein.

   Wer unser Busse wolle pflegen

   Der soll gelten und wieder geben.

   Now join us all who will repent

   Let's flee the fiery heat of hell.

   Lucifer is a bad companion

   Whom he clutches, he covers with pitch.

   Let us flee away from him.

   Whoso will through our penance go

   Let him restore what he's taken away. [892]

   In falling flat on the ground, they stretched out their arms to
   represent the arms of the cross. The fourth hymn, sung at the third
   genuflection, was a lament over the punishment of hell to which the
   Usurer, the liar, the murderer, the road-robber, the man who neglected
   to fast on Friday and to keep Sunday, were condemned, and with this was
   coupled a prayer to Mary.


   Das Hilf uns Maria Königin,

   Dass wir deines Kindes Huld gewin.

   Mary, Queen, help us, pray,

   To win the favor of thy child. [893]

   Each penitent indicated his besetting sin. The hard drinker put his
   finger to his lips. The perjurer held up his two front fingers as if
   swearing an oath. The adulterer fell on his belly. The gambler moved
   his hand as if in the act of throwing dice.

   During the ravages of the Black Death a contingent of 120 of these
   penitential warriors crossed the channel from Holland and marched
   through London and other English towns, wearing red crosses and having
   their scourges pointed with pieces of iron as sharp as needles. [894]
   But they failed to secure a following.

   It was inevitable that the Flagellants should incur opposition from the
   Church authorities. The mediaeval Church as little tolerated
   independence in ritual or organization as in doctrine. In France, they
   were opposed from the first. The University of Paris issued a
   deliverance against them, and Philip VI. forbade their manoeuvres on
   French soil under pain of death. A harder blow was struck by the head
   of Christendom, Clement VI., who fulminated his sweeping bull Oct. 20,
   1349. Flagellants starting from Basel appeared in Avignon to the
   number, according to one document, of 2000. Before issuing his bull,
   Clement and his cardinals listened to the sermon on the subject
   preached by the Paris doctor, John du Fayt. The preacher selected 13 of
   the Flagellant tenets and practices for his reprobation, including the
   shedding of their own blood, a practice, he declared, fit for the
   priests of Baal, and the murder of Jews for their supposed crime of
   poisoning the wells, in which was sought the origin of the Black
   Plague. Clement pronounced the Flagellant movement a work of the devil
   and the angelic letter a forgery. He condemned the warriors for
   repudiating the priesthood and treating their penances as equivalent to
   the journey to the jubilee in Rome, set for 1350. [895] The bull was
   sent to the archbishops of England, France, Poland, Germany and Sweden,
   and it called upon them to invoke, if necessary, the secular arm to put
   down the new rebellion against the ordinances of the Church.

   Against such opposition the Flagellants could not be expected to
   maintain themselves long. Sharp enactments were directed against them
   by the Fleming cities and by archbishops, as in Prag and Magdeburg.
   Strassburg forbade public scourgings on its streets. As late as 1353,
   the archbishop of Cologne found it necessary to order all priests who
   had favored them to confess on pain of excommunication. [896]

   We are struck with four features of the Flagellant movement during the
   Black Death,--its organization, the part assumed in it by the laity,
   the use of music and, in general, its strong religious and ethical
   character. In Italy, before this time, these people had their
   organizations. There was scarcely an Italian city which did not have
   one or more such brotherhoods. Padua had six, Perugia and Fabiano
   three, but the movement does not seem to have developed opposition to
   Church authority. In some of the outbreaks priests were the leaders,
   and the permanent organizations seem to have formed a close association
   with the Dominicans and Franciscans and to have devoted themselves to
   the care of the poor and sick.

   On the other hand, in the North, a spirit of independence of the clergy
   manifested itself. This is evident from the Flagellant codes of the
   German and Dutch groups, current at the time of the great pestilence
   and in after years. The conditions of membership included
   reconciliation with enemies, the consent of husband or wife or, in the
   case of servants, the consent of their masters, strict obedience to the
   leaders, who were called master or rector, and ability to pay their own
   expenses. During the campaigns, which lasted 33½ days, they were to ask
   no alms nor to wash their persons or their clothing, nor cut their
   beards nor speak to women, nor to lie on feather beds. They were
   forbidden to carry arms or to pursue the flagellation to the limit
   where it might lead to sickness or death. [897]

   Five pater nosters and ave Marias were prescribed to be said before and
   after meals, and it was provided that, so long as they lived, they
   should flagellate themselves every Friday three times during the day
   and once at night. The associations were called brotherhoods, and the
   members were bidden to call each other not chum--socium -- but brother,
   "seeing that all were created out of the same element and bought with
   the same price." [898]

   The leaders of the fraternities were laymen, and, as just indicated,
   the equality of the members before God and the cross was emphasized.
   The movement was essentially a lay movement, an expression of the
   spirit of dissatisfaction in Northern Germany and the Lowlands with the
   sacerdotal class. [899] Some of the codes condemn the worship of
   images, the doctrine of transubstantiation, indulgences, priestly
   unction and, in cases, they substituted the baptism of blood for water
   baptism. One of these, containing 50 articles, expressly declared that
   the body of Christ is not in the sacrament, and that "indulgences
   amount to nothing and together with priests are condemned of God." The
   26th article said, "It is better to die with a skin tanned with dust
   and sweat than with one smeared with a whole pound of priestly
   ointment." [900]

   The German hymns as well as the codes of the Flagellants urge the duty
   of prayer and the mortification of the flesh and the preparation for
   death, the abandonment of sin, the reconciliation of enemies and the
   restoration of goods unjustly acquired. These sentiments are further
   vouched for by the chroniclers.

   To these religionists belongs the merit of having revived the use of
   popular religious song. Singing was a feature of the earliest
   Flagellant movement, 1259. [901] Their hymns are in Latin, Italian,
   French, German and Dutch. In Italian they went by the name of laude,
   and in German leisen. The Italian hymns, like the German, agree that
   sins have brought down the judgment of God and in appealing to the
   Virgin Mary, and call upon the "brethren" to castigate themselves, to
   confess their sins and to live in peace and brotherhood. They beseech
   the Virgin to prevail upon her son to stop "the hard death and
   pestilence--Gesune tolga via l' aspra morte e pistilentia. [902] Most
   of these hymns are filled with the thought of death and the woes of
   humanity, but the appeals to Mary are full of tenderness, and every
   conceivable allegory is applied to her from the dove to the gate of
   paradise, from the rose to a true medicine for every sickness. The
   songs of the Italian and the Northern Flagellants seem to have been
   independent of each other. [903]

   The cohorts in the North agreed in using the same penitential song at
   their drills, but they had a variety of scores and songs for their
   marches. [904] While the most of the words of their songs have been
   known, it is only recently that some of the music has been found to
   which the Flagellants sang their hymns. A manuscript of Hugo of
   Reutlingen, dating from 1349 and discovered at St. Petersburg, gives 8
   such tunes, together with the words and an account of the movement.
   [905] The hearers, in describing the impression made upon them by the
   melodies, mention their sweetness, their orderly rhythm,--ordine miro
   hymnos cantabant,--and their pathos capable of "moving hearts of stone
   and bringing tears to the eyes of the most stolid." [906]

   Altogether, the Flagellant movement during the Black Death, 1349, must
   be regarded as a genuinely popular religious movement.

   The next outbreak of Flagellant zeal, which occurred in 1399, was
   confined for the most part to Italy. The Flagellants, who were
   distinguished by mantles with a red cross, appeared in Genoa, Piacenza,
   Modena, Rome and other Italian cities. A number of accounts have come
   down to us, now favorable as the account of the "notary of Pistoja,"
   now unfavorable as the account of von Nieheim. According to the
   Pistojan writer, the movement had its origin in a vision seen by a
   peasant in the Dauphiné, which is of interest as showing the relative
   places assigned in the popular worship to Christ and Mary. After a
   midday meal, the peasant saw Christ as a young man. Christ asked him
   for bread. The peasant told him there was none left, but Christ bade
   him look, and behold! he saw three loaves. Christ then bade him go and
   throw the loaves into a spring a short distance off. The peasant went,
   and was about to obey, when a woman, clad in white and bathed in tears,
   appeared, telling him to go back to the young man and say that his
   mother had forbidden it. He went, and Christ repeated his command, but
   at the woman's mandate the peasant again returned to Christ. Finally he
   threw in one of the loaves, when the woman, who was Mary, informed him
   that her Son was exceedingly angry at the sinfulness of the world and
   had determined to punish it, even to destruction. Each loaf signified
   one-third of mankind and the destruction of one-third was fixed, and if
   the peasant should cast in the other two loaves, all mankind would
   perish. The man cast himself on his knees before the weeping Virgin,
   who then assured him that she had prayed her Son to withhold judgment,
   and that it would be withheld, provided he and others went in
   processions, flagellating themselves and crying "mercy" and "peace,"
   and relating the vision he had seen. [907]

   The peasant was joined by 17 others, and they became the nucleus of the
   new movement. The bands slept in the convents and church grounds, sang
   hymns,--laude,--from which they were also called laudesi, and scourged
   themselves with thongs as their predecessors had done. Miracles were
   supposed to accompany their marches. Among the miracles was the
   bleeding of a crucifix, which some of the accounts, as, for example,
   von Nieheim's, explain by their pouring blood into a hole in the
   crucifix and then soaking the wood in oil and placing it in the sun to
   sweat. According to this keen observer, the bands traversed almost the
   whole of the peninsula. Fifteen thousand, accompanied by the bishop of
   Modena, marched to Bologna, where the population put on white. Not only
   were the people and clergy of Rome carried away by their
   demonstrations, but also members of the sacred college and all classes
   put on sackcloth and white. The pope went so far as to bestow upon them
   his blessing and showed them the handkerchief of St. Veronica. Nieheim
   makes special mention of their singing and their new songs -- nova
   carmina. But the historian of the papal schism could see only evil and
   fraud in the movement, [908] and condemns their lying together
   promiscuously at night, men and women, boys and girls. On their marches
   they stripped the trees bare of fruit and left the churches and
   convents, where they encamped, defiled by their uncleanness. An end was
   put to the movement in Rome by the burning of one of the leading
   prophets.

   The bull of Clement VI. was followed, in l372, by the fulmination of
   Gregory XI., who associated the Flagellants with the Beghards, and by
   the action of the Council of Constance. In a tract presented to the
   council in 1417, Gerson asserted that the sect made scourging a
   substitute for the sacrament of penance and confession. [909] He called
   upon the bishops to put down its cruel and sanguinary members who dared
   to shed their own blood and regarded themselves as on a par with the
   old martyrs. The laws of the decalogue were sufficient without the
   imposition of any new burdens, as Christ himself taught, when he said,
   "If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments." This judgment of
   the theologians the Flagellants might have survived, but the merciless
   probe of the Inquisition to which they were exposed in the 15th century
   took their life. Trials were instituted against them in Thuringia under
   the Dominican agent, Schönefeld, 1414. At one place, Sangerhausen, near
   Erfurt, 91 were burnt at one time and, on another occasion, 22 more.
   The victims of the second group died, asserting that all the evils in
   the Church came from the corrupt lives of the clergy.

   The Flagellant movement grew out of a craving which the Church life of
   the age did not fully meet. Excesses should not blind the eye to its
   good features. Hugo of Reutlingen concludes his account of the outbreak
   of 1349 with the words: "Many good things were associated with the
   Flagellant brothers, and these account for the attention they excited."

   A group of sectaries, sometimes associated by contemporary writers with
   the Flagellants, was known as the Dancers. These people appeared at
   Aachen and other German and Dutch towns as early as 1374. In Cologne
   they numbered 500. Like the Flagellants, they marched from town to
   town. Their dancing and jumping--dansabant et saltabant -- they
   performed half naked, sometimes bound together two and two, and often
   in the churches, where they had a preference for the spaces in front of
   the images of the Virgin. Cases occurred where they fell dead from
   exhaustion. In Holland, the Dancers were also called Frisker or Frilis,
   from frisch,--spry,--the word with which they encouraged one another in
   their terpsichorean feats. [910]

   To another class of religious independents belong the Waldenses, who,
   in spite of their reputation as heretics, continued to survive in
   France, Piedmont and Austria. They were still accused of allowing women
   to preach, denying the real presence and abjuring oaths, extreme
   unction, infant baptism and also of rejecting the doctrines of
   purgatory and prayers for the dead. [911]

   With occasional exceptions, the Waldensians of Italy and France were
   left unmolested until the latter part of the 15th century and the dukes
   of Savoy were inclined to protect them in their Alpine abodes. But the
   agents of the Inquisition were keeping watch, and the Franciscan
   Borelli is said to have burned, in 1393, 150 at Grenoble in the
   Dauphiné in a single day. It remained for Pope Innocent VIII. to set on
   foot a relentless crusade against this harmless people as his
   predecessor of the same name, Innocent III., set on foot the crusade
   against the Albigenses. His notorious bull of May 5, 1487, called upon
   the king of France, the duke of Savoy and other princes to proceed with
   armed expeditions against them and to crush them out "as venomous
   serpents." [912] It opened with the assertion that his Holiness was
   moved by a concern to extricate from the abyss of error those for whom
   the sovereign Creator had been pleased to endure sufferings. The
   striking difference seems not to have occurred to the pontiff that the
   Saviour, to whose services he appealed, gave his own life, while he
   himself, without incurring any personal danger, was consigning others
   to torture and death.

   Writing of the crusade which followed, the Waldensian historian, Leger,
   says that all his people had suffered before was as "flowers and roses"
   compared to what they were now called upon to endure. Charles VIII.
   entered heartily into the execution of the decree, and sent his
   captain, Hugo de la Palu. The crusading armies may have numbered 18,000
   men.

   The mountaineer heretics fled to the almost inaccessible platform
   called Pré du Tour, where their assailants could make no headway
   against their arrows and the stones they hurled. On the French side of
   the Alps the crusade was successful. In the Val de Louise, 70, or,
   according to another account, 3000, who had fled to the cave called
   Balme de Vaudois, were choked to death by smoke from fires lit at the
   entrance. Many of the Waldenses recanted, and French Waldensianism was
   well-nigh blotted out. Their property was divided between the bishop of
   Embrun and the secular princes. As late as 1545, 22 villages inhabited
   by French Waldenses were pillaged and burnt by order of the parliament
   of Provence. With the unification of Italy in 1870, this ancient and
   respectable people was granted toleration and began to descend from its
   mountain fastnesses, where it had been confined for the half of a
   millennium.

   in Austria, the fortunes of the Waldensians were more or less
   interwoven with the fortunes of the Hussites and Bohemian Brethren. In
   parts of Northern Germany, as in Brandenburg in 1480, members of the
   sect were subjected to severe persecutions. In the Lowlands we hear of
   their imprisonment, banishment and death by fire. [913]

   The mediaeval horror of heresy appears in the practice of ascribing to
   heretics nefarious performances of all sorts. The terms Waldenses and
   Waldensianism were at times made synonymous with witches and
   witchcraft. Just how the terms Vauderie, Vaudoisie, Vaudois, Waudenses
   and Valdenses came to be used in this sense has not been satisfactorily
   explained. But such usage was in vogue from Lyons to Utrecht, and the
   papal bull of Eugenius IV., 1440, refers to the witches in Savoy as
   being called Waldenses. [914] An elaborate tract entitled the
   Waldensian Idolatry, [915] -- Valdenses ydolatrae,--written in 1460 and
   giving a description of its treatment in Arras, accused, the Waldenses
   with having intercourse with demons and riding through the air on
   sticks, oiled with a secret unguent.

   § 59. Witchcraft and its Punishment.

   Perhaps no chapter in human history is more revolting than the chapter
   which records the wild belief in witchcraft and the merciless
   punishments meted out for it in Western Europe in the century just
   preceding the Protestant Reformation and the succeeding century. [916]
   In the second half of that century, the Church and society were thrown
   into a panic over witchcraft, and Christendom seemed to be suddenly
   infested with a great company of bewitched people, who yielded
   themselves to the irresistible discipline of Satan. The mania spread
   from Rome and Spain to Bremen and Scotland. Popes, lawyers, physicians
   and ecclesiastics of every grade yielded their assent, and the only
   voices lifted up in protest which have come down to us from the Middle
   Ages were the voices of victims who were subjected to torture and
   perished in the flames. No Reformer uttered a word against it. On the
   contrary, Luther was a stout believer in the reality of demonic agency,
   and pronounced its adepts deserving of the flames. Calvin allowed the
   laws of Geneva against it to stand. Bishop Jewel's sermon before Queen
   Elizabeth in 1562 was perhaps the immediate occasion of a new law on
   the subject. [917] Baxter proved the reality of witchcraft in his
   Certainty of the World of Spirits. On the shores of New England the
   delusion had its victims, at Salem, 1692, and a century later, 1768,
   John Wesley, referring to occurrences in his own time, declared that
   "giving up witchcraft was, in effect, giving up the Bible."

   In the establishment of the Inquisition, 1215, Innocent III. made no
   mention of sorcery and witchcraft. The omission may be explained by two
   considerations. Provision was made for the prosecution of sorcerers by
   the state, and heretical depravity, a comparatively novel phenomenon
   for the Middle Ages, was in Innocent's age regarded as the imminent
   danger to which the Church was exposed.

   Witchcraft was one of the forms of maleficium, the general term adopted
   by the Middle Ages from Roman usage for demonology and the dark arts,
   but it had characteristic features of its own. [918] These were the
   transport of the bewitched through the air, their meetings with devils
   at the so-called sabbats and indulgence in the lowest forms of carnal
   vice with them. Some of these features were mentioned in the canon
   episcopi,--the bishop's canon,--which appeared first in the 10th
   century and was incorporated by Gratian in his collection of canon law,
   1150. But this canon treated as a delusion the belief that wicked women
   were accustomed to ride together in troops through the air at night in
   the suite of the Pagan goddess, Diana, into whose service they
   completely yielded themselves, and this in spite of the fact that women
   confessed to this affinity. [919] The night-riding, John of Salisbury,
   d. 1182, treated as an illusion with which Satan vexed the minds of
   women; but another Englishman, Walter Map, in the same century, reports
   the wild orgies of demons with heretics, to whom the devil appeared as
   a tom-cat. [920]

   From the middle of the 13th century the distinctive features of
   witchcraft began to engage the serious attention of the Church
   authorities. During the reign of Gregory IX., 1227-1241, it became
   evident to them that the devil, not satisfied with inoculating Western
   Europe with doctrinal heresy, had determined to vex Christendom with a
   new exhibition of his malice in works of sorcery and witchcraft.
   Strange cases were occurring which the inquisitors of heresy were quick
   to detect. The Dominican Chantimpré tells of the daughter of a count of
   Schwanenburg, who was carried every night through the air, even eluding
   the strong hold of a Franciscan who one night tried to hold her back.
   In 1275 a woman of Toulouse, under torture, confessed she had indulged
   in sexual intercourse with a demon for many years and given birth to a
   monster, part wolf and part serpent, which for two years she fed on
   murdered children. She was burnt by the civil tribunal.

   But it is not till the 15th century that the era of witchcraft properly
   begins. From about 1430 it was treated as a distinct cult, carefully
   defined and made the subject of many treatises. The punishments to be
   meted out for it were carefully laid down, as also the methods by which
   witches should be detected and tried. The cases were no longer sporadic
   and exceptional; they were regarded as being a gild or sect marshalled
   by Satan to destroy faith from the earth.

   It is probable that the responsibility for the spread of the wild witch
   mania rests chiefly with the popes. Pope after pope countenanced and
   encouraged the belief. Not a single utterance emanated from a pope to
   discourage it. [921] Pope after pope called upon the Inquisition to
   punish witches.

   The list of papal deliverances opened in 1233, when Gregory IX.,
   addressing the bishops of Mainz and Hildesheim, accepted the popular
   demonology in its crudest forms. [922] The devil, so Gregory asserted,
   was appearing in the shapes of a toad, a pallid ghost and a black cat.
   In language too obscene to be repeated, he described at length the
   orgies which took place at the meetings of men and women with demons.
   Where medicines did not cure, iron and fire were to be used. The
   rotting flesh was to be cut out. Did not Elijah slay the four hundred
   priests of Baal and Moses put idolaters to death?

   Before the close of the 13th century, popes themselves were accused of
   having familiar spirits and practising sorcery, as John XXI., 1276, and
   Boniface VIII. Boniface went so far, 1303, as to order the trial of an
   English bishop, Walter of Coventry and Lichfield, on the charge of
   having made a pact with the devil and habitually kissing the devil's
   posterior parts. Under his successor, Clement, the gross charges of
   wantonness with the devil were circulated against the Knights of the
   Temple. In his work, De maleficiis, Boniface VIII.'s physician, Arnold
   of Villanova, stated with scientific precision the satanic devices for
   disturbing and thwarting the marital relation. Among the popes of the
   14th century, John XXII. is distinguished for the credit he gave to all
   sorts of malefic arts and his instructions to the inquisitors to
   proceed against persons in league with the devil. [923]

   Side by side with the papal utterances went the authoritative
   statements of the Schoolmen. Leaning upon Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, d.
   1274, accepted as real the cohabitation of human beings with demons,
   and declared that old women had the power by the glance of their eye of
   injecting into young people a certain evil essence. If the horrible
   beliefs of the Middle Ages on the subject of witchcraft are to be set
   aside, then the bulls of Leo XIII. and Pius X. [924] pronouncing Thomas
   the authoritative guide of Catholic theology must be modified.

   The definitions of the Schoolmen justified the demand which papal
   deliverances made, that the Church tribunal has at least equal
   jurisdiction with the tribunal of the state in ferreting out and
   prosecuting the adepts of the dark arts. Manuals of procedure in cases
   of sorcery used by the Inquisition date back at least to 1270. [925]
   The famous Interrogatory of Bernard Guy of 1320 contains formulas on
   the subject. The canonists, however, had difficulty in defining the
   point at which maleficium became a capital crime. Oldradus, professor
   of canon law in turn at Bologna, Padua and Avignon, sought, about 1325,
   to draw a precise distinction between the two, and gave the opinion
   that, only when sorcery savors strongly of heresy, should it be dealt
   with as heresy was dealt with, the position assumed before by Alexander
   IV., 1258-1260. The final step was taken when Eymericus, in his
   Inquisitorial Directory and special tracts, 1370-1380, affirmed the
   close affinity between maleficium and heresy, and threw the door wide
   open for the most rigorous measures against malefics.

   To such threefold authorization was added the weight of the great
   influence of the University of Paris, which, in 1378, two years after
   the issue of Eymericus' work, sent out 28 articles affirming the
   reality of maleficium.

   Proceeding to the second period in the history of our subject,
   beginning with 1430, it is found to teem with tracts and papal
   deliverances on witchcraft.

   Gerson, the leading theologian of his age, said it was heresy and
   impiety to question the practice of the malefic arts, and Eugenius IV.,
   in several deliverances, beginning with 1434, spoke in detail of those
   who made pacts with demons and sacrificed to them. [926] Witchcraft was
   about to take the place in men's minds which heresy had occupied in the
   age of Innocent III. The frightful mania was impending which spread
   through Latin Christendom under the Renaissance popes, from Pius II. to
   Clement VII., and without a dissenting voice received their sanction.
   Of the Humanist, Pius II., better things might have been expected, but
   he also, in 1459, fulminated against the malefics of Brittany. To what
   length the Vatican could go in sanctioning the crassest superstition is
   seen from Sixtus IV.'s bull, 1471, in which that pontiff reserved to
   himself the right to manufacture and consecrate the little waxen
   figures of lambs, the touch of which was pronounced to be sufficient to
   protect against fire and shipwreck, storm and hail, lightning and
   thunder, and to preserve women in the hour of parturition. [927]

   Among the documents on witchcraft, emanating from papal or other
   sources, the place of pre-eminence is occupied by the bull, Summis
   desiderantes issued by Innocent VIII., 1484. This notorious
   proclamation, consisting of nearly 1000 words, was sent out in answer
   to questions proposed to the papal chair by German inquisitors, and
   recognizes in clearest language the current beliefs about demonic
   bewitchment as undeniable. It had come to his knowledge, so the pontiff
   wrote, that the dioceses of Mainz, Cologne, Treves, Salzburg and Bremen
   teemed with persons who, forsaking the Catholic faith, were consorting
   with demons. By incantations, conjurations and other iniquities they
   were thwarting the parturition of women and destroying the seed of
   animals, the fruits of the earth, the grapes of the vine and the fruit
   of the orchard. Men and women, flocks and herds, trees and all herbs
   were being afflicted with pains and torments. Men could no longer
   beget, women no longer conceive, and wives and husbands were prevented
   from performing the marital act. In view of these calamities, the pope
   authorized the Dominicans, Heinrich Institoris and Jacob Sprenger,
   professors of theology, to continue their activity against these
   malefics in bringing them to trial and punishment. He called upon the
   bishop of Salzburg to see to it that they were not impeded in their
   work and, a few months later, he admonished the archbishop of Mainz to
   give them active support. In other documents, Innocent commended
   Sigismund, archbishop of Austria, the count of the Tyrol and other
   persons for the aid they had rendered to these inquisitors in their
   effort to crush out witchcraft.

   The burning of witches was thus declared the definite policy of the
   papal see and the inquisitors proceeded to carry out its instructions
   with untiring and merciless severity. [928]

   Innocent's communication, so abhorrent to the intelligent judgment of
   modern times, would seem of itself to sweep away the dogma of papal
   infallibility, even if there were no cases of Liberius, the Arian, or
   Honorius, the Monothelite. The argument is made by Pastor and Cardinal
   Hergenröther that Innocent did not officially pronounce on the reality
   of witchcraft when, proceeding upon the basis of reports, he condemned
   it and ordered its punishment. [929] However, in case this explanation
   be not regarded as sufficient, these writers allege that the decision,
   being of a disciplinary nature, would have no more binding force than
   any other papal decision on non-dogmatic subjects. This distinction is
   based upon the well-known contention of Catholic canonists that the
   pope's inerrancy extends to matters of faith and not to matters of
   discipline. Leaving these distinctions to the domain of theological
   casuistry, it remains a historic fact that Innocent's bull deepened the
   hold of a vicious belief in the mind of Europe and brought thousands of
   innocent victims to the rack and to the flames. The statement made by
   Dr. White is certainly not far from the truth when he says that, of all
   the documents which have issued from Rome, imperial or papal,
   Innocent's bull first and last cost the greatest suffering. [930]
   Innocent might have exercised his pontifical infallibility in denying,
   or at least doubting, the credibility of the witnesses. A simple word
   from him would have prevented untold horrors. No one of his successors
   in the papal chair has expressed any regret for his deliverance, much
   less consigned to the Index of forbidden books the Malleus maleficarum,
   the inquisitors' official text-book on witchcraft, most of the editions
   of which printed Innocent's bull at length.

   Innocent's immediate successors followed his example and persons or
   states opposing repressive measures against witches were classed with
   malefactors and, as in the case of Venice, the state was threatened by
   Leo X. with the fulminations of the Church if it did not render active
   assistance. At the papal rebuke, Brescia changed its attitude and in a
   single year sentenced 70 to the flames.

   Next to Innocent's bull, the Witches Hammer,--Malleus
   maleficarum,--already referred to, is the most important and nefarious
   legacy the world has received on witchcraft. Dr. Lea pronounces it "the
   most portentous monument of superstition the world has produced." [931]
   These two documents were the official literature which determined the
   progress and methods of the new crusade.

   The Witches Hammer, published in 1486, proceeded from the hands of the
   Dominican Inquisitors, Heinrich Institoris, whose German name was
   Kraemer, and Jacob Sprenger. The plea cannot be made that they were
   uneducated men. They occupied high positions in their order and at the
   University of Cologne. Their book is divided into three parts: the
   first proves the existence of witchcraft; the second sets forth the
   forms in which it manifested itself; the third describes the rules for
   its detection and prosecution. In the last quarter of the 15th century
   the world, so it states, was more given over to the devil than in any
   preceding age. It was flooded with all kinds of wickedness. In
   affirming the antics of witches and other malefics, appeal is made to
   the Scriptures and to the teachings of the Church and especially to
   Augustine and Thomas Aquinas. Witches and sorcerers, whose father is
   the devil, are at last bound together in an organized body or sect.
   They meet at the weekly sabbats and do the devil homage by kissing his
   posterior parts. He appears among them as a tom-cat, goat, dog, bull or
   black man, as whim and convenience suggest. Demons of both sexes swarm
   at the meetings. Baptism and the eucharist are subjected to ridicule,
   the cross trampled upon. After an abundant repast the lights are
   extinguished and, at the devil's command "Mix, mix," there follow
   scenes of unutterable lewdness. The devil, however, is a strict
   disciplinarian and applies the whip to refractory members.

   The human members of the fraternity are instructed in all sorts of fell
   arts. They are transported through the air. They kill unbaptized
   children, keeping them in this way out of heaven. At the sabbats such
   children are eaten. Of the carnal intercourse, implied in the words
   succubus and incubus, the authors say, there can be no doubt. To quote
   them, "it is common to all sorcerers and witches to practise carnal
   lust with demons." [932] To this particular subject are devoted two
   full chapters, and it is taken up again and again.

   In evidence of the reality of their charges, the authors draw upon
   their own extensive experience and declare that, in 48 cases of witches
   brought before them and burnt, all the victims confessed to having
   practised such abominable whoredoms for from 10 to 30 years.

   Among the precautions which the book prescribed against being
   bewitched, are the Lord's Prayer, the cross, holy water and salt and
   the Church formulas of exorcism. It also adds that inner grace is a
   preservative. [933]

   The directions for the prosecution of witches, given in the third part
   of the treatise, are set forth with great explicitness. Public rumor
   was a sufficient cause for an indictment. The accused were to be
   subjected to the indignity of having the hair shaved off from their
   bodies, especially the more secret parts, lest perchance some imp or
   charm might be hidden there. Careful rules were given to the
   inquisitors for preserving themselves against being bewitched, and
   Institoris and Sprenger took occasion to congratulate themselves that,
   in their long experience, they had been able to avoid this calamity. In
   case the defender of a witch seemed to show an excess of zeal, this was
   to be treated as presumptive evidence that he was himself under the
   same influence. One of the devices for exposing guilt was a sheet of
   paper of the length of Christ's body, inscribed with the seven words of
   the cross. This was to be bound on the witch's body at the time of the
   mass, and then the ordeal of torture was applied. This measure almost
   invariably brought forth a confession of guilt. The ordeal of the
   red-hot iron was also recommended, but it was to be used with caution,
   as it was the trick of demons to cover the hands of witches with a
   salve made from a vegetable essence which kept them from being burnt.
   Such a case happened in Constance, the woman being able to carry the
   glowing iron six paces and thus going free.

   Of all parts of this manual, none is quite so infamous as the author's
   vile estimate of woman. If there is any one who still imagines that
   celibacy is a sure highway to purity of thought, let him read the
   testimonies about woman and marriage given by mediaeval writers,
   priests and monks, themselves celibate and presumably chaste. Their
   impurities of expression suggest a foul atmosphere of thought and
   conversation. The very title of the Malleus maleficarum--the Hammer of
   the Female Malefics--is in the feminine because, as the authors inform
   their readers, the overwhelming majority of those who were behagged and
   had intercourse with demons were women. [934] In flat contrast to our
   modern experience of the religious fidelity of women, the authors of
   this book derive the word femina -- woman--from fe and minus, that is,
   fides minus, less in faith. Weeping and spinning and deceiving they
   represent as the very essence of her nature. She deceives, because she
   was formed from Adam's rib and that was crooked.

   A long chapter, I. 6, is devoted to showing woman's inferiority to man
   and the subject of her alliance with demons is dwelt upon, apparently
   with delight. The cohabitation with fiends was in earlier ages, the
   authors affirm, against the will of women, but in their own age it was
   with their full consent and by their ardent desire. They thank God for
   being men. Few of their sex, they say, consent to such obscene
   relations,--one man to ten women. This refusal was due to the male's
   natural vigor of mind, vigor rationis. To show the depravity of woman
   and her fell agency in history, Institoris and Sprenger quote all the
   bad things they can heap up from authors, biblical and classic,
   patristic and scholastic, Cato, Terence, Seneca, Cicero, Jerome. Jesus
   Sirach's words are frequently quoted, "Woman is more bitter than
   death." Helen, Jezebel and Cleopatra are held forth as examples of
   pernicious agency which wrought the destruction of kingdoms, such
   catastrophes being almost invariably due to woman's machinations.

   It was the common representation of the writers of the outgoing century
   of the Mediaeval Age that God permits the intervention of Satan's
   malefic agency through the marriage bed more than through any other
   medium, and for the reason that the first sin was carried down through
   the marital act. On this point, Thomas Aquinas is quoted by one author
   after the other. [935] Preachers, as well as writers on witchcraft,
   took this disparaging view of woman. Geiler of Strassburg gave as the
   reason for ten women being burnt to one man on the charge of
   witchcraft, woman's loquacity and frivolity. He quoted Ambrose that
   woman is the door to the devil and the way of iniquity--janua diaboli
   et via iniquitatis. Another noted preacher of the 15th century, John
   Nider, gave ten cases in which the cohabitation of man and woman is a
   mortal sin and, in a Latin treatise on moral leprosy, included the
   marriage state. [936] A century earlier, in his De planctu ecclesiae,
   written from Avignon, Bishop Alvarez of Pelayo enumerated 102 faults
   common to women, one of these their cohabitation with the denizens of
   hell. From his own experience, the prelate states, he knew this to be
   true. It was practised, he says, in a convent of nuns and vain was his
   effort to put a stop to it.

   Experts gave it as their opinion that "the new sect of witches" had its
   beginning about the year 1300. [937] But the writers of the 15th and
   16th centuries were careful to prove that their two characteristic
   performances, the flight through the air and demonic intercourse, were
   not illusions of the imagination, but palpable realities. [938] To the
   testimonies of the witches themselves were added the ocular
   observations of church officials. [939] Other devilish performances
   dwelt upon, were the murder of children before baptism, the eating of
   their flesh after it had been consecrated to the devil and the
   trampling upon the host. [940] One woman, in 1457, confessed she had
   been guilty of the last practice 30 years.

   The more popular places of the weekly sabbats were the Brocken,
   Benevento, Como and the regions beyond the Jordan. Here the witches and
   demons congregated by the thousands and committed their excesses. The
   witches went from congregation to congregation as they pleased [941]
   and, according to Prierias, children as young as eight and ten joined
   in the orgies.

   Sometimes it went hard with the innocent, though prurient, onlookers of
   these scenes, as was the case with the inquisitor of Como, Bartholomew
   of Homate, and some of his companions. Determined to see for
   themselves, they looked on at a sabbat in Mendrisio from a place of
   concealment. As if unaware of their presence, the presiding devil
   dismissed the assembly, but immediately calling the revellers back, had
   them drag the intruders forth and the demons belabored them so lustily
   that they survived only 15 days. [942] The forms the devil usually
   assumed were those of a large tom-cat or a goat. If the meeting was in
   a building, he was wont to descend by a ladder, tail foremost. The
   witches kissed his posterior parts and, after indulging in a feast, the
   lights were put out and wild revels followed. As early as 1460,
   pictures were printed representing women riding through the air,
   straddling stocks and broomsticks, on goats or carried by demons. In
   Normandy, the obsessed were called broom-riders--scobaces. [943] Taught
   by demons, they made a salve of the ashes of a toad fed on the wafer,
   the blood of murdered children and other ingredients, which they
   applied to their riding sticks to facilitate their flights. According
   to the physician, John Hartlieb, who calls this salve the "unguent of
   Pharelis"--Herodias--it was made from seven different herbs, each
   gathered on a different day of the week and mixed with the fat of birds
   and animals. [944]

   The popularity of the witch-delusion as a subject of literary treatment
   is shown by the extracts Hansen gives from 70 writings, without
   exhausting the list. [945] Most of the writers were Dominicans. The
   Witches Hammer was printed in many editions, issued 13 times before
   1520 and, from 1574-1669, 16 times. The most famous of these writers in
   the earlier half of the 15th century was John Nider, d. 1438, in his
   Formicarius or Ant-Industry. He was a member of the Dominican order,
   professor of theology in Vienna and attended the Council of Basel.
   Writers like Jacquier were not satisfied with sending forth a single
   treatise. [946] Writers like Sylvester Prierias, d. 1523, known in the
   history of Luther, and Bartholomew Spina, d. 1546, occupied important
   positions at the papal court. [947] These two men expounded Innocent
   VIII.'s bull, and quote the Witches Hammer. Geiler of Strassburg
   repeated from the pulpit the vilest charges against witches. Pico della
   Mirandola, the biographer of Savonarola, filled a book with material of
   the same sort, and declared that one might as well call in question the
   discovery of America as the existence of witches. [948]

   The prosecution of witches assumed large proportions first in
   Switzerland and Northern Italy and then in France and Germany. In Rome,
   the first reported burning was in 1424. [949] In the diocese of Como,
   Northern Italy, 41 were burnt the year after the promulgation of
   Innocent VIII.'s bull. Between 1500-1525 the yearly number of women
   tried in that district was 1000 and the executions averaged 100. In
   1521, Prierias declared that the Apennine regions were so full of
   witches that they were expected soon to outnumber the faithful.

   In France, one of the chief victims, the Carmelite William Adeline, was
   professor in Paris and had taken part in the Council of Basel.
   Arraigned by the Inquisition, 1453, he confessed to being a Vaudois,
   and having habitually attended their synagogues and done homage to the
   devil. In spite of his abjurations, he was kept in prison till he died.
   [950] In Briançon, 1428-1447, 110 women and 57 men were executed for
   witchcraft in the flames or by drowning.

   In Germany, Heidelberg, Pforzheim, Nürnberg, Würzburg, Bamberg, Vienna,
   Cologne, Metz and other cities were centres of the craze and witnessed
   many executions. It was during the five years preceding 1486 that
   Heinrich Institoris and Sprenger sent 48 to the stake. The Heidelberg
   court-preacher, Matthias Widman, of Kemnat, pronounced the "Cathari or
   heretical witches" the most damnable of the sects, one which should be
   subjected to "abundance of fire and without mercy." He reports that
   witches rode on broomsticks, spoons, cats, goats and other objects, and
   that he had seen many of them burnt in Heidelberg. In 1540, six years
   before Luther's death, four witches and sorcerers were burnt in
   Protestant Wittenberg. And in 1545, 34 women were burnt or quartered in
   Geneva. In England the law for the burning of heretics, 1401, was
   applied to these unfortunate people, not a few of whom were committed
   to the flames. But the persecution in the mediaeval period never took
   on the proportions on English soil it reached on the Continent; and
   there, it was not the Church but the state that dealt with the crime of
   sorcery.

   According to the estimate of Louis of Paramo, himself a distinguished
   inquisitor of Sicily who had condemned many to the flames, there had
   been during the 150 years before 1597, the date of his treatise on the
   Origin and Progress of the Inquisition, 30,000 executions for
   witchcraft. [951]

   The judgments passed upon witches were whipping, banishment and death
   by fire, or, as in Cologne, Strassburg and other places, by drowning.
   The most common forms of torture were the thumb-screw and the
   strappado. In the latter the prisoner's hands were bound behind his
   back with a rope which was drawn through a pulley in the ceiling. The
   body was slowly lifted up, and at times left hanging or allowed to
   suddenly drop to the floor. In our modern sense, there was no
   protection of law for the accused. The suspicion of an ecclesiastical
   or civil court was sufficient to create an almost insurmountable
   presumption of guilt. Made frantic by the torture, the victims were
   willing to confess to anything, however untrue and repulsive it might
   be. Death at times must have seemed, even with the Church's ban,
   preferable to protracted agonies, for the pains of death at best lasted
   a few hours and might be reduced to a few minutes. As Lecky has said,
   these unfortunate people did not have before them the prospect of a
   martyr's crown and the glory of the heavenly estate. They were not
   buoyed up by the sympathies and prayers of the Church. Unpitied and
   unprayed for, they yielded to the cold scrutiny of the inquisitor and
   were consumed in the flames.

   Persons who took the part of the supposed witch, or ventured to lift up
   their voices against the trials for witchcraft, did so at the risk of
   their lives. In 1598, the Dutch priest, Cornelius Loos Callidus, was
   imprisoned at Treves for declaring that women, making confession under
   torture to witch devices, confessed to what was not true. And four
   years before, 1589, Dr. Dietrich Flade, a councillor of Treves, was
   burnt for attacking the prosecution of witchcraft. [952]

   The belief in demonology and all manner of malefic arts was a legacy
   handed down to the Church from the old Roman world and, where the
   influence of the Northern mythologies was felt, the belief took still
   deeper roots. But it cannot be denied that cases and passages taken
   from the Scriptures, especially the Old Testament, were adduced to
   justify the wild dread of malign spirits in the Middle Ages. Saul's
   experience with the witch of Endor, the plagues brought by the devil
   upon Job, the representations in Leviticus and Deuteronomy, incidents
   from the Apocrypha and the cases of demonic agency in the New Testament
   were dwelt upon and applied with literal and relentless rigor.

   It is a long chapter which begins with the lonely contests the old
   hermits had with demons, recounts the personal encounters of mediaeval
   monks in chapel and cell and relates the horrors of the inquisitorial
   process for heresy. Our more rational processes of thought and our
   better understanding of the Christian law of love happily have brought
   this chapter to a close in enlightened countries. The treatment here
   given has been in order to show how greatly a Christian society may
   err, and to confirm in this generation the feeling of gratitude for the
   better sentiments which now prevail. It is perhaps also clue to those
   who suffered, that a general description of the injustice done them
   should be given. The chapter may not unfitly be brought to a close by
   allowing one of the victims to speak again from his prison-cell, the
   burgomaster of Bamberg, though he suffered a century after the Middle
   Ages had closed, 1628. After being confronted by false witnesses he
   confessed, under torture, to having indulged in the practices ascribed
   to the bewitched and he thus wrote to his daughter: --

   Many hundred good nights, dearly beloved daughter, Veronica. Innocent
   have I come into prison, innocent must I die. For whoever comes into a
   witch-prison must become a witch or be tortured till he invents
   something out of his head and--God pity him--bethinks himself of
   something. I will tell you how it has gone with me .... Then came the
   executioner and put the thumbscrews on me, both hands bound together,
   so that the blood ran out at the nails and everywhere, so that for four
   weeks I could not use my hands, as you can see from the writing ....
   Then they stripped me, bound my hands behind my back and drew me up. I
   thought heaven and earth were at an end. Eight times did they do this
   and let me drop again so that I suffered terrible agony .... [Here
   follows a rehearsal of the confessions he was induced to make.] ...
   Now, dear child, you have all my confessions for which I must die. They
   are sheer lies made up. All this I was forced to say through fear of
   the rack, for they never leave off the torture till one confesses
   something .... Dear child, keep this letter secret so that people may
   not find it or else I shall be tortured most piteously and the jailers
   be beheaded .... I have taken several days to write this for my hands
   are both lame. Good night, for your father Johannes Junius will never
   see you more. [953]

   [916] Lempens pronounces the prosecution of witchcraft the greatest
   crime of all times, das grösste Verbrechen aller Zeiten. Witches were
   called fascinaret, strigimagae, lamiae, phytonissae, strigae, streges,
   maleficae, Gazarii, that is, Cathari, and Valdenses, etc. For the
   derivation of the German term, Hexe, see J. Francke's discussion in
   Hansen, Quellen, pp. 615-670.

   [917] In Protestant Scotland the iron collar and gag were used. The
   last trial in England occurred in 1712. A woman was executed for
   witchcraft in Seville in 1781 and another in Glarus in 1782. Dr.
   Diefenbach, in his Aberglaube, etc., attempts to prove that the belief
   in witchcraft was more deepseated in Protestant circles than in the
   Catholic Church. Funk, Kirchengesch., p. 419, Hefele, Kirchengesch., p.
   522, and other Catholic historians take care to represent the share
   Protestants had in the persecution of witches as equal to the share of
   the Catholics.

   [918] Alexander Hales distinguished eight sorts of maleficium. Martin
   V. and Eugenius IV. call the workers of the dark arts sortilegi,
   divinatores, demonum invocatores, carminatores, conjuratores,
   superstitiosi, augures, utentes artibus nefariis et prohibitis. See
   Hansen, Quellen, p. 16 sqq. Henry IV.'s council of bishops, met at
   Worms, 1076, in deposing Gregory VII., accused him of witchcraft and
   making covenant with the devil.

   [919] Sceleratae mulieres ... credunt se et profitentur nocturnis horis
   cum Diana paganorum dea et innumera multitudine mulierum equitare super
   quasdam bestas, etc. Hansen, Quellen, p. 88 sq.

   [920] See Vol. V., I. 889-897, and Hansen, Zauberwahn, p. 144.

   [921] Michelet, p. 9, says: "I unfalteringly declare that the witch
   appeared in the age of that deep despair which the gentry of the Church
   engendered. The witch is a crime of their own achieving." Döllinger,
   Papstthum, p. 123, says that witchcraft in its different
   manifestations, from the 13th to the 17th century, is "a product of the
   faith in the plenary authority of the pope. This may seem to be a
   paradox, but it is not hard to prove." Hoensbroech's language, I., 381,
   is warm but true, when he says, "In all this period the pope was the
   patron and the prop of the belief in witchcraft, spreading it and
   confirming it."

   [932] Hoc est commune omnium maleficarum spurcitias carnales cum
   daemonibus exercere, Malleus II. 4. The author goes into all the
   details of the demon's procedure, the demon as he approaches men being
   known as the succubus, and women as the incubus. Many of the details
   are too vile to repeat. Such passages of Scripture are quoted as Gen.
   vi. 2 and 1 Cor. xi. 10, which is made to teach that the woman wears a
   covering on her head to guard herself against the looks of lustful
   angels. The demons, in becoming succubi and incubi, are not actuated by
   carnal lust, so the author asserts, but by a desire to make their
   victims susceptible to all sorts of vices.

   [933] Many cases are given to show the efficacy of these preservatives.
   For example, a man in Ravensburg, who was tempted by the devil in the
   shape of a woman, became much concerned, and at last, recalling what a
   priest had said in the pulpit, sprinkled himself with salt and at once
   escaped the devil's influence.

   to sorcery than men, Alexander Hales declared that it was because she
   had less intellectual vigor than man, minus habet discretionem

   § 60. The Spanish Inquisition.


   Torquemada's name, with clouds o'ercast,

   Looms in the distant landscape of the past

   Like a burnt tower upon a blackened heath,

   Lit by the fires of burning woods beneath.

   Longfellow.

   The Inquisition of Spain is one of the bywords of history. The horrors
   it perpetrated have cast a dark shadow over the pages of Spanish
   annals. Organized to rid the Spanish kingdoms of the infection of
   heresy, it extended its methods to the Spanish dependencies in Europe,
   Sicily and Holland and to the Spanish colonies of the new world. After
   the marriage of Philip II. with Mary Tudor it secured a temporary
   recognition in England. In its bloody sacrifices, Jews, Moors,
   Protestants and the practitioners of the dark arts were included. No
   country in the world was more concerned to maintain the Catholic faith
   pure than was Spain from the 15th to the 18th century, and to no Church
   organization was a more unrestricted authority given than to the
   Spanish Inquisition. Agreeing with the papal Inquisition established by
   Innocent III. in its ultimate aim, the eradication of heresy, it
   differed from that earlier institution by being under the direction of
   a tribunal appointed by the Spanish sovereign, immediately amenable to
   him and acting independently of the bishops. The papal Inquisition was
   controlled by the Apostolic see, which appointed agents to carry its
   rules into effect and whose agency was to a certain extent subject to
   the assent of the bishops.

   Engaged in the wars for the dispossession of the Pagan Moors, the
   Spanish kingdoms had shown little disposition to yield to the intrusion
   of Catharan and other heresy from the North. The menace to its orthodox
   repose came from the Jews, Jews who held firmly to their ancestral
   faith and Jews who had of their own impulse or through compulsion
   adopted the Christian rites. In no part of Europe was the number of
   Jews so large and nowhere had they been more prosperous in trade and
   reached such positions of eminence as physicians and as counsellors at
   court. The Jewish literature of mediaeval Spain forms a distinct and
   notable chapter in Hebrew literary history. To rid the land of the Jews
   who persisted in their ancestral belief was not within the jurisdiction
   of the Church. That belonged to the state, and, according to the canon
   law, the Jew was not to be molested in the practice of his religion.
   But the moment Jews or Moors submitted to baptism they became amenable
   to ecclesiastical discipline. Converted Jews in Spain were called
   conversos, or maranos -- the newly converted--and it was with them, in
   its first period, that the Spanish Inquisition had chiefly to do. After
   Luther's doctrines began to spread it addressed itself to the
   extirpation of Protestants, but, until the close of its history, in
   1834, the Jewish Christians constituted most of its victims.

   From an early time Spanish legislation was directed to the humiliation
   of the Jews and their segregation from the Christian population. The
   oecumenical Council of Vienne, 1312, denounced the liberality of the
   Spanish law which made a Jewish witness necessary to the conviction of
   a Jew. Spanish synods, as those of Valladolid and Tarragona, 1322,
   1329, gave strong expression to the spirit of intolerance with which
   the Spanish church regarded the Jewish people. The sacking and
   wholesale massacre of their communities, which lived apart in quarters
   of their own called Juderias, were matters of frequent occurrence, and
   their synagogues were often destroyed or turned into churches. It is
   estimated that in 1391, 50,000 Jews were murdered in Castile, and the
   mania spread to Aragon. [955]

   The explanation of this bitter feeling is to be sought in the haughty
   pride of the descendants of Abraham according to the flesh, their
   persistent observance of their traditions and the exorbitant rates of
   usury which they charged. Not content with the legal rate, which in
   Aragon was 20% and in Castile 331/3% they often compelled
   municipalities to pay even higher rates. The prejudice and fears of the
   Christian population charged them with sacrilege in the use of the
   wafer and the murder of baptized children, whose blood was used in
   preparations made for purposes of sorcery. Legislation was made more
   exacting. The old rules were enforced enjoining a distinctive dress and
   forbidding them to shave their beards or to have their hair cut round.
   All employment in Christian households, the practice of medicine and
   the occupation of agriculture were denied them. Scarcely any trade was
   left to their hand except the loaning of money, and that by canon law
   was illegal for Christians.

   The joint reign of Ferdinand, 1452-1516, and Isabella, 1451-1504,
   marked an epoch in the history of the Jews in Spain, both those who
   remained true to their ancestral faith and the large class which
   professed conversion to the Christian Church. [956]

   In conferring the title "Catholic" upon Ferdinand and Isabella, 1495,
   Alexander VI. gave as one of the reasons the expulsion of the Jews from
   Spain, 1492. The institution of the Spanish Inquisition, which began
   its work twelve years before, was directed primarily against the
   conversos, people of Jewish blood and members of the Church who in
   heart and secret usage remained Jews.

   The papal Inquisition was never organized in Castile, and in Aragon it
   had a feeble existence. With the council of Tortosa, 1429, complaints
   began to be made that the conversos neglected to have their children
   baptized, and by attending the synagogues and observing the Jewish
   feasts were putting contempt upon their Christian faith. That such
   hypocrisy was practised cannot be doubted in view of the action of the
   Council of Basel which put its brand upon it. In 1451 Juan II. applied
   to the papal court to appoint a commission to investigate the
   situation. At the same time the popular feeling was intensified by the
   frantic appeals of clerics such as Friar Alfonso de Espina who in his
   Fortalicium fidei -- the Fortification of the Faith--brought together a
   number of alleged cases of children murdered by Jews and argued for the
   Church's right to baptize Jewish children in the absence of the
   parents' consent. [957] The story ran that before Isabella's accession
   her confessor Torquemada, that hammer of heretics, secured from her a
   vow to leave no measure untried for the extirpation of heresy from her
   realm. Sometime later, listening to this same ecclesiastic's appeal,
   Ferdinand and his consort applied to the papal see for the
   establishment of the Inquisition in Castile.

   Sixtus IV., who was then occupying the chair of St. Peter, did not
   hesitate in a matter so important, and on Nov. 1, 1478, issued the bull
   sanctioning the fell Spanish tribunal. It authorized the Spanish
   sovereigns to appoint three bishops or other ecclesiastics to proceed
   against heretics and at the same time empowered them to remove and
   replace these officials as they thought fit. After a delay of two
   years, the commission was constituted, 1480, and consisted of two
   Dominican theologians, Michael de Morillo and John of St. Martin, and a
   friar of St. Pablo, Seville. A public reception was given to the
   commission by the municipal council of Seville. The number of prisoners
   was soon too large for the capacity of St. Pablo, where the court first
   established itself, and it was removed to the chief stronghold of the
   city, the fortress of Triana, whose ample spaces and gloomy dungeons
   were well fitted for the dark work for which it had been chosen.

   Once organized, the Inquisition began its work by issuing the so-called
   Edict of Grace [958] which gave heretics a period of 30 or 40 days in
   which to announce themselves and, on making confession, assured them of
   pardon. Humane as this measure was, it was also used as a device for
   detecting other spiritual criminals, those confessing, called
   penitentes, being placed under a vow to reveal the names of heretics.
   The humiliations to which the penitents were subjected had exhibition
   at the first auto de fe held in Toledo, 1486, when 750 penitents of
   both sexes were obliged to march through the city carrying candles and
   bare-headed; and, on entering the cathedral, were informed that
   one-fifth of their property had been confiscated, and that they were
   thenceforth incapacitated to hold public office. The first auto de fe
   was held in Seville, Feb. 6, 1481, six months after the appointment of
   the tribunal, when six men and women were cremated alive. The ghastly
   spectacle was introduced with a sermon, preached by Friar Alfonso de
   Hojeda. A disastrous plague, which broke out in the city, did not
   interrupt the sittings of the tribunal, which established itself
   temporarily at Aracena, where the first holocaust included 23 men and
   women. According to a contemporary, by Nov. 4, 1491, 298 persons had
   been committed to the flames and 79 condemned to perpetual
   imprisonment. [959] The tribunal established at Ciudad Real, 1483,
   burnt 52 heretics within two years, when it was removed, in 1485, to
   Toledo. In Avila, from 1490-1500, 75 were burnt alive, and 26 dead
   bodies exhumed and cast into the flames. In cases, the entire conversos
   population was banished, as in Guadalupe, by the order of the
   inquisitor-general, Deza, in 1500. From Castile, the Inquisition
   extended its operations to Aragon, where its three chief centres were
   Valencia, Barcelona and Saragossa, and then to the Balearic Islands,
   where it was especially active. The first burning in Saragossa took
   place, 1484, when two men were burnt alive and one woman in effigy, and
   at Barcelona in 1488, when four persons were consumed alive.

   The interest of Sixtus IV. continued to follow the tribunal he had
   authorized and, in a letter addressed to Isabella, Feb. 13, 1483, he
   assured the queen that its work lay close to his heart. The same year,
   to render the tribunal more efficient, it was raised by Ferdinand to
   the dignity of the fifth council of the state with the title, Concejo
   de la Suprema y General Inquisicion. Usually called the suprema, this
   body was to have charge of the Holy Office throughout the realm. The
   same end was promoted by the creation of the office of
   inquisitor-general, 1483, to which the power was consigned of removing
   and appointing inquisitorial functionaries. The first incumbent was
   Thomas de Torquemada, at that time prior of Santa Cruz in Segovia. This
   fanatical ecclesiastic, whose name is a synonym of uncompromising
   religious intolerance and heartless cruelty, had already been
   appointed, in 1482, an inquisitor by the pope. He brought to his duties
   a rare energy and formulated the rules characteristic of the Spanish
   Inquisition.

   With Torquemada at its head, the Holy Office became, next to royalty
   itself, the strongest power in Spain. Its decisions fell like the blow
   of a great iron hammer, and there was no power beneath the sovereign
   that dared to offer them resistance. In 1507, at the death of Deza,
   third inquisitor-general, Castile and Aragon were placed under distinct
   tribunals. Cardinal Ximenes, 1436-1517, a member of the Franciscan
   order and one of the foremost figures in Spanish church history, was
   elevated to the office of supreme inquisitor of Castile. His
   distinction as archbishop of Toledo pales before his fame as a scholar
   and patron of letters. He likewise was unyielding in the prosecution of
   the work of ridding his country of the taint of heresy, but he never
   gave way to the temptation of using his office for his own advantage
   and enriching himself from the sequestrated property of the conversos,
   as Torquemada was charged with doing.

   Under Adrian of Utrecht, at first inquisitor-general of Aragon, the
   tribunals of the two kingdoms were again united in 1518, and, by the
   addition of Navarre, which Ferdinand had conquered, the whole Iberian
   peninsula, with the exception of Portugal, came under the jurisdiction
   of a single supreme official. Adrian had acted as tutor to Charles V.,
   and was to succeed Leo X. on the papal throne. From his administration,
   the succession of inquisitors-general continued unbroken till 1835,
   when the last occupant of the office died, Geronimo Castellan y Salas,
   bishop of Tarazona. [960]

   The interesting question has been warmly discussed, whether the
   Inquisition of Spain was a papal institution or an institution of the
   state, and the attempt has been made to lift the responsibility for its
   organization and administration from the supreme pontiff. The answer
   is, that it was predominantly an ecclesiastical institution, created by
   the authority of Sixtus IV. and continuously supported by pontifical
   sanction. On the other hand, its establishment was sought after by
   Ferdinand and Isabella, and its operations, after the papal
   authorization had been secured, was under the control of the Spanish
   sovereign. So far as we know, the popes never uttered a word in protest
   against the inhuman measures which were practised by the Spanish
   tribunals. Their only dissent arose from the persistence with which
   Ferdinand kept the administrative agency in his own hands and refused
   to allow any interference with his disposition of the sequestrated
   estates. [961] The hearty approbation of the Apostolic see is vouched
   for in many documents, and the responsibility for the Spanish tribunal
   was distinctly assumed by Sixtus V., Jan. 22, 1588, as an institution
   established by its authority. Sixtus IV. and his successors sought
   again and again to get its full management into their own hands, but
   were foiled by the firmness of Ferdinand. When, for example, in a bull
   dated April 18, 1482, the pope ordered the names of the witnesses and
   accusers to be communicated to the suspects, that the imprisonments
   should be in episcopal gaols, that appeal might be taken to the
   Apostolic chair and that confessions to the bishop should stop all
   prosecution, Ferdinand sharply resented the interference and hinted
   that the suggestion had started with the use of conversos gold in the
   curia. This papal action was only a stage in the battle for the control
   of the Holy Office. [962] Ferdinand was ready to proceed to the point
   of rupture with Rome rather than allow the principle of appeals which
   would have reduced the power of the suprema to impotence. Sixtus wrote
   a compromising reply, and a year later, October, 1483, Ferdinand got
   all he asked for, and the appointment of Torquemada was confirmed.

   The royal management of the Inquisition was also in danger of being
   fatally hampered by letters of absolution, issued according to custom
   by the papal penitentiary, which were valid not only in the court of
   conscience but in stopping public trials. Ferdinand entered a vigorous
   protest against their use in Spain, when Sixtus, 1484, confirmed the
   penitentiary's right; but here also Sixtus was obliged to retreat, at
   least in part, and Alexander VI. and later Clement VII., 1524, made
   such letters invalid when they conflicted with the jurisdiction of the
   Spanish tribunal. Spain was bent on doing things in its own way and won
   practical independence of the curia. [963]

   The principle, whereby in the old Inquisition the bishops were
   co-ordinate in authority with the inquisitors or superior to them, had
   to be abandoned in Spain in spite of the pope's repeated attempts to
   apply it. Innocent VIII., 1487, completely subjected the bishops to the
   inquisitorial organization, and when Alexander, 1494, annulled this
   bull and required the inquisitors to act in conjunction with the
   bishop, Ferdinand would not brook the change and, under his protection,
   the suprema and its agents asserted their independence to Ferdinand.

   Likewise, in the matter of confiscations of property, the sovereign
   claimed the right to dictate their distribution, now applying them for
   the payment of salaries to the inquisitors and their agents, now
   appropriating them for the national exchequer, now for his own use or
   for gifts to his favorites.

   No concern of his reign, except the extension of his dominions,
   received from Ferdinand more constant and sympathetic attention than
   the deletion of heresy. With keen delight he witnessed the public
   burnings as adapted to advance the Catholic faith. He scrutinized the
   reports sent him by inquisitors and, at times, he expressed his
   satisfaction with their services by gifts of money. In his will, dated
   the day before his death, he enjoined his heir, Charles V., to be
   strenuous in supporting the tribunal. As all other virtues, so this
   testament ran, "are nothing without faith by which and in which we are
   saved, we command the illustrious prince, our grandson, to labor with
   all his strength to destroy and extirpate heresy from our kingdoms and
   lordships, appointing ministers, God-fearing and of good conscience,
   who will conduct the Inquisition justly and properly for the service of
   God and the exaltation of the Catholic faith, and who will also have a
   great zeal for the destruction of the sect of Mohammed." [964] Without
   doubt, the primary motive in the establishment of the tribunal was with
   Ferdinand, and certainly with Isabella, religious.

   There seems at no time to have been any widespread revolt against the
   procedure of the Inquisition. In Aragon, some mitigation of its rigors
   and rules was proposed by the Cortes of Barcelona, 1512, such as the
   withdrawal from the inquisitors of the right to carry weapons and the
   exemption of women from the seizure of their property, in cases where a
   husband or father was declared a heretic, but Ferdinand and Bishop
   Enguera, the Aragonese inquisitor-general, were dispensed by Leo X.,
   1514, from keeping the oath they had taken to observe the rules. At
   Charles V.'s accession, an effort was made to have some of the more
   offensive evils abolished, such as the keeping of the names of
   witnesses secret, and in 1520 the Cortes of Valladolid and Corunna made
   open appeal for the amendment of some of the rules. Four hundred
   thousand ducats were offered, presumably by conversos, to the young
   king if he would give his assent, and, as late as 1528, the kingdom of
   Granada, in the same interest, offered him 50,000 ducats. But the
   appeals received no favorable action and, under the influence of
   Ximines, in 1517, the council of Castile represented to Charles that
   the very peace of Spain depended upon the maintenance of the
   Inquisition. The cardinal wrote a personal letter to the king,
   declaring that interference on his part would cover his name with
   infamy. [965]

   The most serious attempt to check the workings of the Inquisition
   occurred in Saragossa and resulted in the assassination of the chief
   inquisitor, Peter Arbues, an act of despair laid at the door of the
   conversos. Arbues was murdered in the cathedral Jan. 25, 1485, the
   fatal blow being struck from behind, while the priest was on his knees
   engaged in prayer. He knew his life was threatened and not only wore a
   coat of mail and cap of steel, but carried a lance. He lingered
   twenty-four hours. Miracles wrought at the coffin vouched for the
   sanctity of the murdered ecclesiastic. The sacred bell of Villela
   tolled unmoved by hands. Arbues' blood liquefied on the cathedral floor
   two weeks after the deed. Within two years, the popular veneration
   showed itself in the erection of a splendid tomb to the martyr's memory
   and the Catholic Church, by the bull of Pius IX., June 29, 1867, has
   given him the honors of canonization. As the assassination of the papal
   delegate, Peter of Castelnau, at the opening of the crusade against the
   Albigenses, 1208, wrought to strengthen Innocent in his purpose to wipe
   out heresy, even with the sword, likewise the taking off of Arbues only
   tightened the grip of the Spanish Inquisition in Aragon. His murderers
   and all in any way accessory to the crime were hunted down, their hands
   were cut off at the portal of the cathedral and their bodies dragged to
   the market-place, where they were beheaded and quartered or burnt
   alive. [966]

   Next to the judicial murders perpetrated by the Inquisition, its chief
   evil was the confiscation of estates. The property of the conversos
   offered a tempting prize to the cupidity of the inquisitors and to the
   crown. The tribunal was expected to live from the spoils of the
   heretics. Torquemada's Instructions of 1484 contained specific rules
   governing the disposition of goods held by heretics. There was no limit
   put upon their despoilment, except that lands transferred before 1479
   were exempted from seizure, a precaution to avoid the disturbance of
   titles. The property of dead heretics, though they had lain in their
   graves fifty years, was within the power of the tribunal. The dowries
   of wives were mercifully exempted whose husbands were adjudged
   heretical, but wives whose fathers were found to be heretics lost their
   dowries. The claims of the children of heretic fathers might have been
   expected to call for merciful consideration, but the righteousness of
   their dispossession had no more vigorous advocates than the clergy. To
   such property, as the bishop of Simancas argued, the old Christian
   population had a valid moral claim. The Instructions of 1484 direct
   that, if the children were under age at the time of the confiscation,
   they were to be distributed among pious families, and announced it as
   the king's intention, in case they grew up good Christians, so to endow
   them with alms, especially the girls, that they might marry or enter
   religion. [967]

   The practice of confiscation extended to the bedding and wearing
   apparel of the victims. One gracious provision was that the slaves of
   condemned heretics should receive freedom. Lands were sold at auction
   30 days after their sequestration, but the low price which they often
   brought indicates that purchasers enjoyed special privileges of
   acquisition. Ferdinand and his successor, Charles, were profuse in
   their disposition of such property. Had the moneys been used for the
   wars against the Moors, as at first proposed by Torquemada, the plea
   might be made that the tribunal was moved by unselfish considerations,
   but they were not. Not only did Ferdinand take money for his bankrupt
   treasury, but he appropriated hunting horses, pearls and other objects
   for his own use. The Flemish favorites of Charles V., in less than ten
   months, sent home 1,100,000 ducats largely made up of bequests derived
   from the exactions of the sacred court. [968] Dr. Lea, whose merit it
   is to have shown the vast extent to which the sequestration of estates
   was carried, describes the money transactions of the Inquisition as "a
   carnival of plunder." It was even found to be not incompatible with a
   purpose to maintain the purity of the faith to enter into arrangements
   whereby, for a sufficient consideration, communities received
   protection from inquisitorial charges. The first such bargain was made
   at Valencia, 1482. The king, however, did not hesitate on occasion to
   violate his pact and allow unfortunate conversos, who had paid for
   exemption, to be arraigned and condemned. No law existed requiring
   faith to be kept with a heretic. It also happened that condemned
   conversos purchased freedom from serving in the galleys or wearing the
   badge of heresy, the sanbenito. [969]

   As early as 1485, Ferdinand and Isabella were able to erect a royal
   palace at Guadalupe, costing 2,732,333 maravedis, with the proceeds of
   sequestrated property and, in a memorial address to Charles V., 1524,
   Tristan de Leon asserted that these sovereigns had received from the
   possessions of heretics no less than 10,000,000 ducats. Torquemada also
   was able to spend vast sums upon his enterprises, such as the
   conventual building of St. Thomas at Avila, which it was supposed were
   drawn from the victims whom his religious fervor condemned to the loss
   of their goods and often of their lives. [970] When the heretical mine
   was showing signs of exhaustion in Spain, the Spanish colonies of
   Mexico and Peru poured in their spoils to enable the Holy Office to
   maintain the state to which it had been accustomed. At an early period,
   it began to take care for its own perpetuation by making investments on
   a large scale. [971]

   After Ferdinand's death, the suprema's power increased, and it demanded
   a respect only less than that which was yielded to the crown. Its
   arrogance and insolence in administration kept pace with the high
   pretension it made to sacredness of aim and divine authority. The
   institution was known as the Holy Office, the building it occupied was
   the holy house, casa santa, and the public solemnity at which the
   tribunal appeared officially before the public and announced its
   decisions was called the act of faith, auto de fe.

   The suprema acted upon the principle started by Paramo, that the
   inquisitor was the chief personage in his district. He represented both
   the pope and king. [972] On the one hand, he claimed the right to
   arrest at will and without restriction from the civil authority; on the
   other, he demanded freedom for his officials from all arrest and
   violence.

   In trading and making exports, the Holy Office claimed exemption from
   the usual duties levied upon the people at large. Immunity from
   military service and the right to carry deadly weapons by day and night
   were among other privileges to which it laid claim. A deliverance of
   the Apostolic see, 1515, confirmed it in its right to arrest the
   highest noble in the land who dared to attack its prerogatives or
   agents and, in case of need, to protect itself by resort to bloodshed.
   Its jurisdiction extended not only to the lower orders of the clergy,
   but also to members of the orders, a claim which, after a long
   struggle, was confirmed by the edicts of Pius IV. and V., 1559, 1561. A
   single class was exempted from the rules of its procedure, the bishops.
   However, the exemption was rather apparent than real, for the Holy
   Office exercised the right of arraigning bishops under suspicion before
   the papal chair. The first cases of this kind were prelates of Jewish
   extraction, Davila of Segovia, 1490, and Aranda of Calahorra, 1498.
   Both were tried in Rome, the former being exonerated, and Aranda kept
   in prison in S. Angelo, where he is supposed to have died, 1500. The
   most famous of the episcopal suspects, the archbishop of Toledo,
   Bartholomew of Carranza, 1503-1576, was kept in prison for 17 years,
   partly in Spain and partly in Rome. The case enjoyed a European
   reputation.

   Carranza had the distinction of administering the last rites to Charles
   V. and was for a time a favorite of Philip II., but that sinister
   prince turned against him. Partly from jealousy of Carranza's honors,
   as has been surmised, and chiefly on account of his indiscretions of
   speech, the inquisitor-general Valdes decided upon the archbishop's
   prosecution, and when his Commentary on the Catechism appeared in
   Spanish, he was seized under authorization from the Apostolic see,
   1559. For two years the prelate was kept in a secret prison and then
   brought to trial. After delay, Pius IV., 1564, appointed a
   distinguished commission to investigate the case and Pius V. forced his
   transfer in 1567 to Rome, where he was confined in S. Angelo for nine
   years. Under Pius V.'s successor, Gregory XIII., Carranza was compelled
   to abjure alleged errors, suspended from his seat for five years and
   remanded to confinement in a Roman convent, where he afterwards died.
   The boldness and vast power of the Inquisition could have no better
   proof than the indignity and punishment placed upon a primate of Spain,

   The procedure of the Holy Office followed the rules drawn by
   Torquemada, 1484, 1485, called the Instructions of Seville, and the
   Instructions of Valladolid prepared by the same hand, 1488 and 1498.
   These early codes were afterwards known as the Instructiones antiguas,
   and remained in force until superseded by the code of 1561 prepared by
   the inquisitor-general, Valdes.

   Torquemada lodged the control of the Inquisition in the suprema, to
   which all district tribunals were subordinated. Permanent tribunals
   were located at Seville, Toledo, Valladolid, Madrid (Corte), Granada,
   Cordova, Murcia Llerena, Cuenca, Santiago, Logroño and the Canaries
   under the crown of Castile and at Saragossa, Valencia, Barcelona and
   Majorca under the crown of Aragon. [973]

   The officials included two inquisitors an assessor or consulter on
   modes of canonical procedure, an alguazil or executive officer, who
   executed the sentences of the tribunal, notaries who kept the records,
   and censors or califadores who pronounced elaborate opinions on points
   of dispute. To these was added an official who appraised and took
   charge of confiscated property. A large body of subordinates, such as
   the familiars or confidential agents, complete the list of officials.
   Laymen were eligible to the office of inquisitor, provided they were
   unmarried, and a condition made for holding any of these places was
   parity of blood, limpieza, freedom from all stain of Morisco, Jewish or
   heretic parentage and of ancestral illegitimacy. This peculiar
   provision led to endless investigation of genealogical records before
   appointments were made. [974]

   Each tribunal had a house of its own, containing the audience chamber,
   rooms for the inquisitors, a library for the records, le secreto de la
   Inquisicion,--a chamber of torture and secret prisons. The familiars
   have a dark fame. They acted as a body of spies to detect and report
   cases of heresy. Their zeal made them the terror of the land, and the
   Cortes of Monzon, 1512, called for the reduction of their number.

   In its procedure, the Inquisition went on the presumption that a person
   accused was guilty until he had made out his innocence. The grounds of
   arrest were rumor or personal denunciation. Informing on suspects was
   represented to the people as a meritorious act and inculcated even upon
   children as a duty. The instructions of 1484 prescribed a mitigated
   punishment for minors who informed on heretical fathers, and Bishop
   Simancas declared it to be the sacred obligation of a son to bring his
   father, if guilty, to justice. [975] The spiritual offender was allowed
   an advocate. Secrecy was a prime feature in the procedure. After his
   arrest, the prisoner was placed in one of the secret prisons,--carceres
   secretas,--and rigidly deprived of all intercourse with friends. All
   papers bearing upon his case were kept from him. The names of his
   accusers and of witnesses for his prosecution were withheld. In the
   choice of its witnesses the Inquisition allowed itself great liberty,
   even accepting the testimony of persons under the Church's sentence of
   excommunication, of Jews who remained in the Hebrew faith and of
   heretics. Witnesses for the accused were limited to persons zealous for
   the orthodox faith, and none of his relatives to the fourth generation
   were allowed to testify. Heresy was regarded as a desperate disorder
   and to be removed at all costs. On the other hand, the age of
   amenability was fixed at 12 for girls and 14 for boys. The age of
   fourscore gave no immunity from the grim rigors of the exacting
   tribunal. [976]

   The charges, on which victims were arraigned, included the slightest
   deflection in word or act from strict Catholic usage, such as the
   refusal to eat pork on a single occasion, visiting a house where
   Moorish notions were taught, as well as saying that the Virgin herself
   and not her image effected cures, and that Jews and Moors would be
   saved if they sincerely, believed the Jewish and the Moorish doctrines
   to be true. [977] Recourse was had to torture, not only to secure
   evidence of guilt. Even when the testimony of witnesses was sufficient
   to establish guilt, resort was had to torture to extract a confession
   from the accused that thereby his soul might be delivered from the
   burden of secret guilt, to extract information of accomplices, and that
   a wholesome influence might be exerted in deterring others from heresy
   by giving them an example of punishment. The modes of torture most in
   use were the water ordeal and the garruche. In the water-cure, the
   victim, tightly bound, was stretched upon a rack or bed, and with the
   body in an inclined position, the head downward. The jaws were
   distended, a linen cloth was thrust down the victim's throat and water
   from a quart jar allowed to trickle through it into his inward parts.
   [978] On occasion, seven or eight such jars were slowly emptied. The
   garrucha, otherwise known as the strappade, has already been described.
   In its application in Spain it was customary to attach weights to the
   feet and to suspend the body in such a manner that the toes alone
   touched the ground, and the Spanish rule required that the body be
   raised and lowered leisurely so as to increase the pain.

   The final penalties for heresy included, in addition to the spiritual
   impositions of fasting and pilgrimage, confiscation of goods,
   imprisonment, public scourging, the galleys, exile and death.
   Confiscation and burning extended to the dead, against whom the charge
   of heresy could be made out. At Toledo, July 25, 1485, more than 400
   dead were burnt in effigy. Frequently at the autos no living victims
   suffered. In cases of the dead their names were effaced from their
   tombstones, that "no memory of them should remain on the face of the
   earth except as recorded in our sentence." Their male descendants,
   including the grandchildren, were incapacitated from occupying
   benefices and public positions, from riding on horseback, carrying
   weapons and wearing silk or ornaments.

   The penalty of scourging was executed in public on the bodies of the
   victims, bared to the waist, by the public executioner. Women of 86 to
   girls of 13 were subjected to such treatment. Galley labor as a mode of
   punishment was sanctioned by Alexander VI., 1503. The sentence of
   perpetual imprisonment was often relaxed, either from considerations of
   mercy or for financial reasons. Up to 1488, there had been 5000
   condemnations to lasting imprisonment. [979]

   The saco bendito, or sanbenito, another characteristic feature of the
   Spanish Inquisition, was a jacket of gray or yellow texture, furnished
   before and behind with a large cross as prescribed by Torquemada. This
   galling humiliation was aggravated by the rule that, after they were
   laid aside, the sanbenitos should be hung up in the churches, together
   with a record of the wearer's name inscribed and his sentence. To avoid
   the shame of this public display, descendants often sought to change
   their names, a practice the law soon checked. The precedent for the
   sanbenito was found in the covering our first parents wore to hide
   their nakedness, or in the sackcloth worn in the early Church as a mark
   of penance.

   The auto de fe, the final act in the procedure of the Inquisition,
   shows the relentlessness of this tribunal, and gave the spectators a
   foretaste of the solemnities of the day of judgment. There heretics,
   after being tried by the inquisitorial court, were exposed to public
   view, [980] and received the first official notice of their sentence.
   The ceremonial took place on the public squares, where platforms and
   staging were erected at municipal expense, and such occasions were
   treated as public holidays. On the day appointed, the prisoners marched
   in procession, led by Dominicans and others bearing green and white
   crosses, and followed by the officials of the Holy Office. Arrived at
   the square, they were assigned seats on benches. A sermon was then
   preached and an oath taken from the people and also from the king, if
   present, to support the Inquisition. The sentences were then announced.
   Unrepentant heretics were turned over to the civil officers. Wearing
   benitos, inscribed with their name, they were conducted on asses to the
   brasero, or place of burning, which was usually outside the city
   limits, and consigned to the flames. The other heretics were then taken
   back to the prisons of the Inquisition. Inquisitorial agents were
   present at the burnings and made a record of them for the use of the
   religious tribunal. The solemnities of the auto de fe were usually
   begun at 6 in the morning and often lasted into the afternoon.

   Theoretically, the tribunal did not pass the sentence of blood. The
   ancient custom of the Church and the canon law forbade such a decision.
   Its authority ceased with the abandonment--or, to use the technical
   expression, the relaxation--of the offender to the secular arm. By an
   old custom in passing sentence of incorrigible heresy, it even prayed
   the secular officer to avoid the spilling of blood and to exercise
   mercy. The prayer was an empty form. The state well understood its
   duty, and its failure to punish with death heretics convicted by the
   spiritual court was punishable with excommunication. It did not presume
   to review the case, to take new evidence or even to require a statement
   of the evidence on which the sentence of heresy was reached. The duty
   of the secular officer was ministerial, not judicial. The sentence of
   heresy was synonymous with burning at the stake. The Inquisition,
   however, did not stop with turning heretics over to the state, but, as
   even Vacandard admits, at times pronounced the sentence of burning.
   [981]

   So honorable to the state and to religion were the autos de fe regarded
   that kings attended them and they were appointed to commemorate the
   marriage of princes or their recovery from sickness. Ferdinand was in
   the habit of attending them. On the visit of Charles V. to Valencia,
   1528, public exhibition was given at which 13 were relaxed in person
   and 10 in effigy. Philip II.'s marriage, in 1560, to Isabella of Valois
   was celebrated by an auto in Toledo and, in 1564, when this sovereign
   was in Barcelona, a public exhibition was arranged in his honor, at
   which eight were sentenced to death. Such spectacles continued to be
   witnessed by royal personages till 1701, when Philip V. set an example
   of better things by refusing to be present at one.

   The last case of an execution by the Spanish Inquisition was a
   schoolmaster, Cayetano Ripoll, July 26, 1826. His trial lasted nearly
   two years. He was accused of being a deist, and substituting in his
   school the words "Praise be to God" for "Ave Maria purissima." He died
   calmly on the gibbet after repeating the words, "I die reconciled to
   God and to man." [982]

   Not satisfied with putting heretical men out of the world, the
   Inquisition also directed its attention to noxious writings. [983] At
   Seville, in 1490, Torquemada burnt a large number of Hebrew copies of
   the Bible, and a little later, at Salamanca, he burnt 6000 copies. Ten
   years later, 1502, Ferdinand and Isabella promulgated a law forbidding
   books being printed, imported and sold which did not have the license
   of a bishop or certain specified royal judges. All Lutheran writings
   were ordered by Adrian, in 1521, delivered up to the Inquisition.
   Thenceforth the Spanish tribunal proved itself a vigorous guardian of
   the purity of the press. The first formal Index, compiled by the
   University of Louvain, 1546, was approved by the inquisitor-general
   Valdes and the suprema, and ordered printed with a supplement. This was
   the first Index Expurgatorius printed in Spain. All copies of the
   Scriptures in Spanish were seized and burnt, and the ferocious law of
   1558 ordered booksellers keeping or selling prohibited books punished
   with confiscation of goods or death. Strict inquisitorial supervision
   was had over all libraries in Spain down into the 19th century. Of the
   effect of this censorship upon Spanish culture, Dr. Lea says: "The
   intellectual development which in the 16th century promised to render
   Spanish literature and learning the most illustrious in Europe was
   stunted and starved into atrophy, the arts and sciences were neglected,
   and the character which Spain acquired among the nations was tersely
   expressed in the current saying that Africa began at the Pyrenees."

   The "ghastly total" of the victims consigned by the Spanish Inquisition
   to the flames or other punishments has been differently stated. Precise
   tables of statistics are of modern creation, but that it was large is
   beyond question. The historian, Llorente, gives the following figures:
   From 1480-1498, the date of Torquemada's death, 8800 were burnt alive,
   6500 in effigy and 90,004 subjected to other punishments. From
   1499-1506, 1664 were burnt alive, 832 in effigy and 32,456 subjected to
   other punishments. From 1507-1517, during the term of Cardinal Ximines,
   2536 were burnt alive, 1368 in effigy and 47,263 subjected to other
   penalties. This writer gives the grand totals up to 1524 as 14,344
   burnt alive, 9372 in effigy and 195,937 condemned to other penalties or
   released as penitents. In 1524, an inscription was placed on the
   fortress of Triana Seville, running: "In the year 1481, under the
   pontificate of Sixtus IV. and the rule of Ferdinand and Isabella, the
   Inquisition was begun here. Up to 1524, 20,000 heretics and more
   abjured their awful crime on this spot and nearly 1000 were burnt."
   From records still extant, the victims in Toledo before 1501 are found
   to have numbered 297 burnt alive and 600 in effigy, and 5400 condemned
   to other punishment or reconciled. The documents, however, are not
   preserved or, at any rate, not known from which a full estimate could
   be made. In any case the numbers included thousands of victims burnt
   alive and tens of thousands subjected to other punishments. [984]

   The rise of the Spanish Inquisition was contemporary with Spain's
   advance to a foremost place among the nations of Europe. After eight
   centuries, her territory was for the first time completely free from
   the government of the Mohammedan. The renown of her regiments was soon
   to be unequalled. Spanish ships opened the highways of the sea and
   returned from the New World freighted with its wealth. Spanish
   diplomacy was in the ascendant in Italy. But the decay of her vital
   forces her religious zeal did not check. Spain's Catholic orthodoxy was
   assured, but Spain placed herself outside the current of modern culture
   and progress. By her policy of religious seclusion and pride, she
   crushed independence of thought and virility of moral purpose. One by
   one, she lost her territorial acquisitions, from the Netherlands and
   Sicily to Cuba and the Philippines in the far Pacific. Heresy she
   consumed inside of her own precincts, but the paralysis of stagnation
   settled down upon her national life and institutions, and peoples
   professing Protestantism, which she still calls heresy, long since have
   taken her crown in the world of commerce and culture, invention and
   nautical enterprise. The present map of the world has faint traces of
   that empire on which it was the boast of the Spaniard of the 16th
   century that the sun never set. This reduction of territory and
   resources calls forth no spirit of denunciation. Nay, it attracts a
   sympathetic consideration which hopes for the renewed greatness of the
   land of Ferdinand and Isabella, through the introduction of that
   intellectual and religious freedom which has stirred the energies of
   other European peoples and kept them in the path of progress and new
   achievement.

   [956] Ferdinand was associated with his father, John of Navarre, in the
   government of Aragon from the year 1469. The same year he was married
   to Isabella, sister of Henry IV., king of Castile. At Henry's death,
   Isabella's title to the throne was disputed by Juana who claimed to be
   a daughter of Henry, but was popularly believed to be the child of
   Beltram de la Cueva and so called La Beltraneja. The civil war, which
   followed, was brought to a close in 1479 by Juana's retirement to a
   convent, and the undisputed recognition of Isabella. Ferdinand and
   Isabella's reign is regarded as the most glorious in Spanish annals.
   Ferdinand's grandson, through his daughter Juana, Charles V., succeeded
   to his dominions.

   [960] The list is given by Lea, I. 556-559.

   [961] Hefele, in his Life of Cardinal Ximenes, p. 265 sqq., took the
   position that the Spanish Inquisition was a state institution,
   Staatsanstalt, pointing out that the inquisitor-general was appointed
   by the king, and the Inquisitors proceeded in his name. Ranke, Die
   Osmanen u. d. span. Monarchie inFürsten u. Völker, 4th ed., 1877, calls
   it "a royal institution fitted out with spiritual weapons." On the
   other hand, the Spanish historians, Orti y Lara and Rodrigo take the
   position that it was a papal institution. Pastor takes substantially
   this view when he insists upon the dominance of the religious element
   and the bull of Sixtus IV. authorizing it. So, he says, erscheint d.
   span. Inquisition als ein gemischtes Institut mit vorwiegend
   kirchlichem Charakter, 1st ed., II. 542-546, 4th ed., III. 624-630.
   Wetzer-Welte, VI. 777, occupies the same ground and quotes Orti y Lara
   as saying, "The Inquisition fused into one weapon the papal sword and
   the temporal power of kings." Dr. Lea emphasizes the mixed character of
   the agency, and says that the chief question is not where it had its
   origin, but which party derived the most advantage. It is, however, of
   much importance for the history of the papacy as a divine or human
   institution to insist upon its responsibility in authorizing and
   supporting the nefarious Holy Office. Funk says that "the assumption
   that the Spanish Inquisition was primarily a state institution does not
   hold good."

   [962] Lea, I. 235; II. 103 sqq.

   [963] Lea, II. 116, etc., insists upon the double-dealing of the
   papacy, from Sixtus IV. to Julius II., "who with one hand sold letters
   of absolution and with the other declared them invalid by revocation."
   Sixtus' bull of 1484 was confirmed by Paul III., 1549. Its claim, an
   infallible papacy cannot well abandon.

   [981] Lea, III. 185 sq., quotes the sentence upon Mencia Alfonso, tried
   at Guadalupe, 1485, which runs: "As a limb of the devil, she shall be
   taken to the place of burning so that by the secular officials of this
   town justice may be executed upon her according to the custom of these
   kingdoms." Paul III., 1547, and Julius III., 1550, conferred upon
   clerics the right of condemning to mutilation and death in cases where,
   as with the Venetian government, delays were interposed in the
   execution of the ecclesiastical sentence. Vacandard says, p. 180: "Some
   inquisitors, realizing the emptiness of the formula, ecclesia abhorret
   a sanguine, dispensed with it altogether and boldly assumed the full
   responsibility for their sentences. The Inquisition is the real
   judge,--it lights the fires .... It is erroneous to pretend that the
   Church had absolutely no part in the condemnation of heretics to death.
   Her participation was not direct and immediate, but, even though
   indirect, it was none the less real and efficacious." This author, p.
   211, misrepresents history when he makes the legislation of Frederick
   II. responsible for the papal treatment of heresy. Innocent III. had
   been punishing the Albigenses to death long before the appearance of
   Frederick's Constitutions.

   [982] The Spanish Inquisition was introduced into Sicily in 1487, where
   it met with vigorous resistance from the parliament, and in Sardinia,
   1492. In the New World its victims were Protestants, conversos,
   bigamists and fornicators. The Mexican tribunal was abolished in 1820,
   and that of Peru, the same year. As late as 1774 a Bogota physician was
   tried "as the first and only one who in this kingdom and perhaps in all
   America" had publicly declared himself for the Copernican system.

   [984] See Hoensbroech, I. 139, quoting Llorente. Dr. Lea speaks of the
   apparent tendency of early writers to exaggerate the achievements of
   the "Holy Office," and calls in question, though with some hesitation,
   Llorente's figures and the figures given by an early secretary of the
   tribunal, Zurita, who records 4000 burnings and 30,000 reconciliations
   in Seville alone before 1520. See Lea's figures, IV. 513-624. Father
   Gams, in his Kirchengesch. Spaniens, reckons the number of those burnt,
   up to 1604, at 2000, but he excludes from these figures the burnings
   for other crimes than heresy. See Lea, IV. 517.

   § 62. The Intellectual Awakening.

   The discussions, which issued in the Reformatory councils and which
   those councils fostered, were a worthy expression of an awakening
   freedom of thought in the effort to secure relief from ecclesiastical
   abuses. The movement, to which the name Renaissance has been given, was
   a larger and far more successful effort, achieving freedom from the
   intellectual bondage to which the individual man had been subjected by
   the theology and hierarchy of the Church. The intelligence of Italy,
   and indeed of Western Europe as a whole, had grown weary of the
   monastic ideal of life, and the one-sided purpose of the scholastic
   systems to exalt heavenly concerns by ignoring or degrading things
   terrestrial. The Renaissance insisted upon the rights of the life that
   now is, and dignified the total sphere for which man's intellect and
   his aesthetic and social tastes by nature fit him. It sought to give
   just recognition to man as the proprietor of the earth. It substituted
   the enlightened observer for the monk; the citizen for the
   contemplative recluse. It honored human sympathies more than conventual
   visions and dexterous theological dialectics. It substituted
   observation for metaphysics. It held forth the achievements of history.
   It called man to admire his own creations, the masterpieces of
   classical literature and the monuments of art. It bade him explore the
   works of nature and delight himself in their excellency. How different
   from the apparent or real indifference to the beauties of the natural
   world as shown, for example, by the monk, St. Bernard, was the attitude
   of Leon Battista Alberti, d. 1472, who bore testimony that the sight of
   a lovely landscape had more than once made him well of sickness. [985]

   In the narrower sense, the Renaissance may be confined to the recovery
   of the culture of Greece and Rome and the revival of polite literature
   and art, and it is sometimes designated the Revival of Letters. After
   having been taught for centuries that the literature of classic
   antiquity was full of snares and dangers for a Christian public, men
   opened their eyes and revelled with childlike delight in the discovery
   of ancient authors and history. Virgil sang again the Aeneid, Homer the
   Iliad and Odyssey. Cicero once more delivered his orations and Plato
   taught his philosophy. It was indeed an intellectual and artistic new
   birth that burst forth in Italy, a regeneration, as the word
   Renaissance means. But it was more. It was a revolt against monastic
   asceticism and scholasticism, the systems which cramped the free flow
   of bodily enthusiasm and intellectual inquiry. [986] It called man from
   morbid self-mortifications as the most fitting discipline of mortal
   existence here below, and offered him the satisfaction of all the
   elements of his nature as his proper pursuit.

   Beginning in Italy, this new enthusiasm spread north to Germany and
   extended as far as Scotland. North of the Alps, it was known as
   Humanism and its representatives as Humanists, the words being taken
   from literae humanae, or humaniores, that is, humane studies, the
   studies which develop the man as the proprietor of this visible sphere.
   In the wider sense, it comprehends the revival of literature and art,
   the development of rational criticism, the transition from feudalism to
   a new order of social organization, the elevation of the modern
   languages of Europe as vehicles for the highest thought, the
   emancipation of intelligence, and the expansion of human interests, the
   invention of the printing-press, the discoveries of navigation and the
   exploration of America and the East, and the definition of the solar
   system by Copernicus and Galileo,--in one word, all the progressive
   developments of the last two centuries of the Middle Ages, developments
   which have since been the concern of modern civilization.

   The most discriminating characterization of this remarkable movement
   came from the pen of Michelet, who defined it as the discovery of the
   world and man. In this twofold aspect, Burckhardt, its leading
   historian for Italy, has treated the Renaissance with deep
   philosophical insight.

   The period of the Renaissance lasts from the beginning of the 14th to
   the middle of the 16th century, from Roger Bacon, d. 1294, and Dante,
   d. 1321, to Raphael, d. 1520, and Michelangelo, d. 1564, Reuchlin, d.
   1522, and Erasmus, d. 1536. For more than a century it proceeded in
   Italy without the patronage of the Church. Later, from the pontificate
   of Nicolas V. to the Medicean popes, Leo X. and Clement VII., it was
   fostered by the papal court. For this reason the last popes of the
   Middle Ages are known as the Renaissance popes. The movement in the
   courts may be divided into three periods: the age of the great Italian
   literati, Dante, Petrarca and Boccaccio, the age from 1400-1460, when
   the interest in classic literature predominated, and the age from
   1460-1540, when the pursuit of the fine arts was the predominant
   feature. The first age contributed immortal works to literature. In the
   second, Plato and the other classics were translated and sedulously
   studied. In the last, the fine arts and architecture offered their
   array of genius in, Italy.

   To some writers it has occurred to go back as far as Frederick II. for
   the beginnings of the movement. That sovereign embodied in himself a
   varied culture and a versatility of intellect rare in any age. With
   authorship and a knowledge of a number of languages, he combined
   enlightened ideas in regard to government and legislation, the
   patronage of higher education and the arts. For the varied interests of
   his mind, he has been called the first modern man. [987] However, the
   literary activity of his court ceased at his death. Italy was not
   without its poets in the 13th century, but it is with the imposing
   figure of Dante that the revival of culture is to be dated. That a
   Renaissance should have been needed is a startling fact in the history
   of human development and demands explanation. The ban, which had been
   placed by the Church upon the study of the classic authors of antiquity
   and ancient institutions, palsied polite research and reading for a
   thousand years. Even before Jerome, whose mind had been disciplined in
   the study of the classics, at last pronounced them unfit for the eye of
   a Christian, Tertullian's attitude was not favorable. Cassian followed
   Jerome; and Alcuin, the chief scholar of the 9th century, turned away
   from Virgil as a collection of lying fables. At the close of the 10th
   century, a pope reprimanded Arnulf of Orleans by reminding him that
   Peter was unacquainted with Plato, Virgil and Terence, and that God had
   been pleased to choose as His agents, not philosophers and
   rhetoricians, but rustics and unlettered men. In deference to such
   authorities the dutiful churchman turned from the closed pages of the
   old Romans and Greeks. Only did a selected author like Terence have
   here and there in a convent a clandestine though eager reader.

   In the 12th century, it seemed as if a new era in literature was
   impending, as if the old learning was about to flourish again. The
   works of Aristotle became more fully known through the translations of
   the Arabs. Schools were started in which classic authors were read.
   Abaelard turned to Virgil as a prophet. The Roman law was discovered
   and explained at Bologna and other seats of learning. John of
   Salisbury, Grosseteste, Peter of Blois and other writers freely quoted
   from Cicero, Livy, Tacitus, Suetonius, Ovid and other Latin authors.
   But the head of Western Christendom discerned in this movement a grave
   menace to theology and religion, and was quick to blight the new shoot
   with his curse, and in its early statutes, forced by the pope, the
   University of Paris excluded the literature of Rome from its
   curriculum.

   But this arbitrary violence could not forever hold the mind of Europe
   in bonds. The satisfaction its intelligence was seeking, it did not
   find in the subtle discussions of the Schoolmen or the dismal pictures
   of the monastics. When the new movement burst forth, it burst forth in
   Italy, that beautiful country, the heir of Roman traditions. The
   glories of Italy's past in history and in literature blazed forth again
   as after a long eclipse, and the cult of the beautiful, for which the
   Italian is born, came once more into free exercise. In spite of
   invasion after invasion the land remained Italian. Lombards, Goths,
   Normans had occupied it, but the invaders were romanized much more than
   the Italians were teutonized. The feudal system and Gothic architecture
   found no congenial soil south of the Alps. In the new era, it seemed
   natural that the poets and orators of old Italy should speak again in
   the land which they had witnessed as the mistress of all nations. The
   literature and law of Greece and Rome again became the educators of the
   Latin and also of the Teutonic races, preparing them to receive the
   seeds of modern civilization.

   The tap-root of the Renaissance was individualism as opposed to
   sacerdotal authority. Its enfranchising process manifested itself in
   Roger Bacon, whose mind turned away from the rabbinical subtleties of
   the Schoolmen to the secrets of natural science and the discoveries of
   the earth reported by Rubruquis or suggested by his own reflection, and
   more fully in Dante, Marsiglius of Padua and Wyclif, who resisted the
   traditional authority of the papacy. It was active in the discussions
   of the Reformatory councils. And it received a strong impetus in the
   administration of the Lombard cities which gloried in their
   independence. With their authority the imperial policy of Frederick
   Barbarossa and Frederick II. had clashed. Partly owing to the loose
   hold of the empire and partly owing to the papal policy, which found
   its selfish interests subserved better by free contending states and
   republics than by a unified kingdom of Italy under a single temporal
   head, these independent municipalities took such deep root that they
   withstood for nearly a thousand years the unifying process which, in
   the case of France, Great Britain and Spain, resulted in the
   consolidation of strong kingdoms soon after the era of the Crusades
   closed. Upon an oligarchical or a democratic basis, despots and
   soldiers of fortune secured control of their Italian states by force of
   innate ability. Individualism pushed aside the claims of birth, and it
   so happened in the 14th and 15th centuries that the heads of these
   states were as frequently men of illegitimate birth as of legitimate
   descent. In our change-loving Italy, wrote Pius II., "where nothing is
   permanent and no old dynasty exists, servants easily rise to be kings."
   [988]

   It was in the free republic of Florence, where individualism found the
   widest sphere for self-assertion, that the Renaissance took earliest
   root and brought forth its finest products. That municipality, which
   had more of the modern spirit of change and progress than any other
   mediaeval organism, invited and found satisfaction in novel and
   brilliant works of power, whether they were in the domain of government
   or of letters or even of religion, as under the spell of Savonarola.
   There Dante and Lionardo da Vinci were born, and there Machiavelli
   exploited his theories of the state and Michelangelo wrought. The
   Medici gave favor to all forms of enterprise that might bring glory to
   the city. After Nicolas V. ascended the papal throne, Rome vied with
   its northern neighbor as a centre of the arts and culture. The new
   tastes and pursuits also found a home in Ferrara, Urbino, Naples, Milan
   and Mantua.

   Glorious the achievement of the Renaissance was, but it was the last
   movement of European significance in which Italy and the popes took the
   lead. Had the current of aesthetic and intellectual enthusiasm joined
   itself to a stream of religious regeneration, Italy might have kept in
   advance of other nations, but she produced no safe prophets. No
   Reformer arose to lead her away from dead religious forms to living
   springs of spiritual life, from ceremonies and relics to the New
   Testament.

   In spreading north to Germany, Holland and England, the movement took
   on a more serious aspect. There it produced no poets or artists of the
   first rank, but in Reuchlin and Erasmus it had scholars whose erudition
   not only attracted the attention of their own but benefited succeeding
   generations and contributed directly to the Reformation. South of the
   Alps, culture was the concern of a special class and took on the form
   of a diversion, though it is true all classes must have looked with
   admiration upon the works of art that were being produced.

   It was, then, the mission of the Renaissance to start the spirit of
   free inquiry, to certify to the mind its dignity, to expand the horizon
   to the faculties of man as a citizen of the world, to recover from the
   dust of ages the literary treasures and monuments of ancient Greece and
   Rome, to inaugurate a style of fresh description, based on observation,
   in opposition to the dialectic circumlocution of the scholastic
   philosophy, to call forth the laity and to direct attention to the
   value of natural morality and the natural relationships of man with
   man. To the monk beauty was a snare, woman a temptation, pleasure a
   sin, the world vanity of vanities. The Humanist taught that the present
   life is worth living. The Renaissance breathed a cosmopolitan spirit
   and fostered universal sympathies. In the spirit of some of the
   yearnings of the later Roman authors, Dante exclaimed again, "My home
   is the world." [989]

   § 63. Dante, Petrarca, Boccaccio.

   Dante, Petrarca and Boccaccio represent the birth and glory of Italian
   literature and ushered in the new literary and artistic age. Petrarca
   and Boccaccio belong chiefly to the department of literary culture;
   Dante equally to it and the realm of religious thought and composition.
   The period covered by their lives extends over more than a hundred
   years, from Dante's birth in 1265 to Boccaccio's death, 1375.

   Dante Alighieri, 1265-1321, the first of Italian and the greatest of
   mediaeval poets, has given us in his Divina Commedia, the Divine
   Comedy, conceived in 1300, a poetic view of the moral universe under
   the aspect of eternity,--sub specie aeternitatis. Born in Florence, he
   read under his teacher Brunetto Latini, whom in later years he praised,
   Virgil, Horace, Ovid and other Latin authors. In the heated conflict of
   parties, going on in his native city, he at first took the side of the
   Guelfs as against the Ghibellines, who were in favor of the imperial
   régime in Italy. In 1300, he was elected one of the priori or chief
   magistrates, approved the severe measures then employed towards
   political opponents and, after a brief tenure of office, was exiled.
   The decree of exile threatened to burn him alive if he ventured to
   return to the city. After wandering about, going to Paris and perhaps
   further west, he settled down in Ravenna, where he died and where his
   ashes still lie. After his death, Florence accorded the highest honors
   to his memory. Her request for his body was refused by Ravenna, but she
   created a chair for the exposition of the Divine Comedy, with Boccaccio
   as its first occupant, and erected to her distinguished son an-imposing
   monument in the church of Santa Croce and a statue on the square in
   front. In 1865, all Italy joined Florence in celebrating the 6th
   centenary of the poet's birth. Never has study been given to Dante's
   great poem as a work of art by wider circles and with more enthusiasm
   than to-day, and it will continue to serve as a prophetic voice of
   divine judgment and mercy as long as religious feeling seeks
   expression.

   Dante was a layman, married and had seven children. An epoch in his
   life was his meeting, as a boy of nine years, with Beatrice, who was a
   few months younger than himself, at a festival given in her father's
   house, where she was tenderly called, as Boccaccio says, Bice. The
   vision of Beatrice--for there is no record that they exchanged
   words--entered and filled Dante's soul with an effluence of purity and
   benignity which cleared away all evil thoughts. [990] After an interval
   of nine years he saw her a second time, and then not again till, in his
   poetic dream, he met her in paradise. Beatrice married and died at 24,
   1290.

   With this vision, the new life began for Dante, the vita nuova which he
   describes in the book of that name. Beatrice's features illuminated his
   path and her pure spirit was his guide. At the first meeting, so the
   poet says, "she appeared to me clothed in a most noble color, a modest
   and becoming crimson, garlanded and adorned in such wise as befitted
   her very youthful age." The love then begotten, says Charles Eliot
   Norton, "lasted from Dante's boyhood to his death, keeping his heart
   fresh, spite of the scorchings of disappointment, with the springs of
   perpetual solace." [991] The last glimpse the poet gives of her was as
   he saw her at the side of Rachel in the highest region of heaven.


   The third in order, underneath her, lo!

   Rachel with Beatrice.--Par., xxxii. 6.

   Had Dante written only the tract against the temporal power of the
   papacy, the De monarchia, his name would have been restricted to a
   place in the list of the pamphleteers of the 14th century. His Divine
   Comedy exalts him to the eminence of the foremost poetic interpreter of
   the mediaeval world. This immortal poem is a mirror of mediaeval
   Christianity and civilization and, at the same time, a work of
   universal significance and perennial interest. It sums up the religious
   concepts of the Middle Ages and introduces the free critical spirit of
   the modern world. [992] It is Dante's autobiography and reflects his
   own experiences: --


   All the pains by me depicted, woes and tortures, void of pity,

   On this earth I have encountered--found them all in Florence City.
   [993]

   It brings into view the society of mediaeval Italy, a long array of its
   personages, many of whom had only a local and transient interest. At
   the same time, the Comedy is the spiritual biography of man as man
   wherever he is found, in the three conditions of sin, repentance and
   salvation. It describes a pilgrimage to the world of spirits beyond
   this life, from the dark forest of temptation, through the depths of
   despair in hell, up the terraces of purification in purgatory, to the
   realms of bliss. Through the first two regions the poet's guide is
   Virgil, the representative of natural reason, and through the heavenly
   spaces, Beatrice, the type of divine wisdom and love. The Inferno
   reflects sin and misery; the Purgatorio, penitence and hope; the
   Paradiso, holiness and happiness. The first repels by its horrors and
   laments; the second moves by its penitential tears and prayers; the
   third enraptures by its purity and peace. Purgatory is an intermediate
   state, constantly passing away, but heaven and hell will last forever.
   Hell is hopeless darkness and despair; heaven culminates in the
   beatific vision of the Holy Trinity, beyond which nothing higher can be
   conceived by man or angel. Here are depicted the extremes of terror and
   rapture, of darkness and light, of the judgment and the love of God. In
   paradise, the saints are represented as forming a spotless white rose,
   whose cup is a lake of light, surrounded by innocent children praising
   God. This sublime conception was probably suggested by the rose-windows
   of Gothic cathedrals, or by the fact that the Virgin Mary was called a
   rose by St. Bernard and other mediaeval divines and poets.

   Following the geocentric cosmology of the Ptolemaic system, the poet
   located hell within the earth, purgatory in the southern hemisphere,
   and heaven in the starry firmament. Hell is a yawning cavity, widest at
   the top and consisting of ten circles. Purgatory is a mountain up which
   souls ascend. The heavenly realm consists of nine circles, culminating
   in the empyrean where the pure divine essence dwells.

   Among these regions of the spiritual and future world, Dante
   distributes the best-known characters of his and of former generations.
   He spares neither Guelf nor Ghibelline, neither pope nor emperor, and
   gives to all their due. He adapts the punishment to the nature of the
   sin, the reward to the measure of virtue, and shows an amazing
   ingenuity and fertility of imagination in establishing the
   correspondence of outward condition to moral character. Thus the
   cowards and indifferentists in the vestibule of the Inferno are driven
   by a whirling flag and stung by wasps and flies. The licentious are
   hurried by tempestuous winds in total darkness, with carnal lust still
   burning, but never gratified.


   The infernal hurricane, that never rests

   Hurtles the spirits onward in its rapine,

   Whirling them round; and smiting, it molests them;

   It hither, thither, downward, upward, drives them.

   Inferno, V. 31-43.

   The gluttonous lie on the ground, exposed to showers of hail and foul
   water; blasphemers supine upon a plain of burning sand, while sparks of
   fire, like flakes of snow in the Alps, slowly and constantly descend
   upon their bodies. The wrathful are forever tearing one another.


   And I, who stood intent upon beholding,

   Saw people mud-besprent in that lagoon,

   All of them naked and with angry look.

   They smote each other not alone with hands,

   But with the head and with the breast and feet

   Tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth.

   Inferno, VII. 100 sqq.

   The simonists, who sell religion for money and turn the temple of God
   into a den of thieves, are thrust into holes, head downwards, with
   their feet protruding and tormented with flames. The arch-heretics are
   held in red-hot tombs, and tyrants in a stream of boiling blood, shot
   at by the centaurs whenever they attempt to rise. The traitors are
   immersed in a lake of ice with Satan, the arch-traitor and the
   embodiment of selfishness, malignity and turpitude. Their very tears
   turn to ice, symbol of utter hardness, and Satan is forever consuming
   in his three mouths the three arch-traitors, Judas, Brutus and Cassius.
   Milton represents Satan as the archangel who even in hell exalts
   himself and in pride exclaims, "Better to reign in hell than serve in
   heaven," and the poet leaves the mind of the reader disturbed by a
   feeling of admiration for Lucifer's untamed ambition and superhuman
   power. Dante's Satan awakens disgust and horror, and the inscription
   over the entrance to hell makes the reader shudder: --


   Through me ye enter the abode of woe;

   Through me to endless sorrow are brought;

   Through me amid the souls accurst ye go.

   * * * * * * *

   All hope abandon--ye who enter here!


   Per me si va nella città dolente;

   Per me si va nell' eterno dolore;

   Per me si va tra la perduta gente.

   * * * * * * *

   Lasciate ogni speranza, voi ch' entrate.

   Passing out from the domain of gloom and dole, Virgil leads the poet to
   purgatory, where the dawn of day breaks. This realm, as has been said,
   comes nearer to our common life than hell or paradise. [994] Hope
   dwells here. Song, not wailing, is heard. A ship appears, moved by an
   angel and filled with spirits, singing the hymn of redemption. Cato
   approaches and urges the guide and Dante to wash themselves on the
   shore from all remainders of hell and to hurry on. In purgatory, they
   pass through seven stages, which correspond to the seven mortal sins,
   the two lowest, pride and envy, the highest, wantonness and luxury. All
   the penitents have stamped on their foreheads seven P's,--the first
   letter of the word peccata, sins,--which are effaced only one by one,
   as they pass from stage to stage, "enclasped with scorching fire,"
   until they are delivered through penal fire from all stain. A similar
   correspondence exists between sin and punishments as in the Inferno,
   but with the opposite effect, for here sins are repented of and
   forgiven, and the woes are disciplinary until "the wound that healeth
   last is medicined." Thus the proud, in the first and lowest terrace,
   are compelled to totter under huge weights, that they may learn
   humility. The indolent, in the fourth terrace, are exercised by
   constant and rapid walking. The avaricious and prodigal, with hands and
   feet tied together, lie with their faces in the dust, weeping and
   wailing. The gluttons suffer hunger and thirst that they may be taught
   temperance. The licentious wander about in flames that their sensual
   passions may be consumed away.

   Arriving at paradise, the Roman poet can go no further, and Beatrice
   takes his place as Dante's guide. The spirits are distributed in glory
   according to their different grades of perfection. Here are passed in
   review theologians, martyrs, crusaders, righteous princes and judges,
   monks and contemplative mystics. In the 9th heaven Beatrice leaves the
   poet to take her place at the side of Rachel, after having introduced
   him to St. Bernard. Dante looks again and sees Mary and Eve and Sarah,


   ... and the gleaner-maid

   Meek ancestress of him, who sang the songs

   Of sore repentance in his sorrowful mood;

   Gabriel, Adam, Moses, John the Baptist, Peter, St. Augustine and other
   saints. Then he is led by the devout mystic to Mary, who, in answer to
   his prayer, shows him the Deity in the empyrean, but what he saw was
   not for words to utter. Alike are all the saints in enjoying the same
   reward of the beatific vision.

   Dante was in full harmony with the orthodox faith of his age, and
   followed closely the teachings of Thomas Aquinas' great book of
   divinity. [995] He accepted all the distinctive tenets of mediaeval
   Catholicism--purgatory, the worship of Mary, the intercession of
   saints, the efficacy of papal indulgences and the divine institution of
   the papacy. He paid deep homage to the monastic life and accords
   exalted place to Benedict, St. Francis and Dominic. But he cast aside
   all traditions in dealing freely with the successors of Peter in the
   Apostolic see. Here, too, he was under the direction of the beloved
   Beatrice. The evils in the Church he traced to her temporal power and
   he condemned to everlasting punishment Anastasius II. for heresy,
   Nicolas III., Boniface VIII. and Clement V. for simony, Coelestine V.
   for cowardice in abdicating the pontifical office, and a squad of other
   popes for avarice.

   Following the theology of Augustine and Thomas Aquinas, he put into
   hell the whole heathen world except two solitary figures, Cato of
   Utica, who sacrificed life for liberty and keeps watch at the foot of
   purgatory, and the just emperor, Trajan, who, 500 years after his
   death, was believed to have been prayed out of hell by Pope Gregory I.
   To the region of the Inferno, also, though on the outer confines of it,
   a place is assigned to infants who die in infancy without being
   baptized, whether the offspring of Christian or heathen parents. Theirs
   is no conscious pain, but they remain forever without the vision of the
   blessed. In the same vicinity the worthies of the old dispensation were
   detained until Christ descended after his crucifixion and gave them
   release. There, John the Baptist had been kept for two years after his
   pains of martyrdom, Par. xxxii. 25. In the upper regions of the
   hopeless Inferno a tolerably comfortable place is also accorded to the
   noble heathen poets, philosophers, statesmen and warriors, while
   unfaithful Christians are punished in the lower circles according to
   the degrees of their guilt. The heathen, who followed the light of
   nature, suffer sorrow without pain. As Virgil says: --


   In the right manner they adored not God.

   For such defects, and not for other guilt,

   Lost are we, and are only so far punished,

   That without hope we live on, in desire.

   Dante began his poem in Latin and was blamed by Giovanni del Virgilio,
   a teacher of Latin literature in Bologna, because he abandoned the
   language of old Rome for the vulgar dialect of Tuscany. Poggio also
   lamented this course. But the poet defended himself in his unfinished
   book, Eloquence in the Vernacular, De vulgari eloquio, [996] and, by
   writing the Commedia, the Vita nuova, the Convivio and his sonnets in
   his native Florentine tongue, he became the father of Italian
   literature and opened the paths of culture to the laity. Within three
   years of the poet's death, commentaries began to be written on the
   Divina Commedia, as by Graziuolo de' Bambagliolo, 1324, and within 100
   years chairs were founded for its exposition at Florence, Venice,
   Bologna and Pisa.

   A second service which Dante rendered in his poem to the coming culture
   was in bringing antiquity once more into the foreground and treating
   pagan and Christian elements side by side, though not as of the same
   value, and interweaving mythological fables with biblical history,
   classical with Christian reminiscences. By this tolerance he showed
   himself a man of the new age, while he still held firmly to the
   mediaeval theology. [997]

   Dante's abiding merit, however, was his inspiring portrayal of the
   holiness and love of God. Sin, the perversion of the will, is punished
   with sin continuing in the future world and pain. Salvation is through
   the "Lamb of God who takes away our sins and suffered and died that we
   might live." This poem, like a mighty sermon, now depresses, now
   enraptures the soul, or, to use the lines of the most poetic of his
   translators, Longfellow,


   Thy sacred song is like the trump of doom;

   Yet in thy heart what human sympathies,

   What soft compassion glows.

   Francesco Petrarca, 1304-1374, was the most cultured man of his time.
   His Italian sonnets and songs are masterpieces of Italian poetic
   diction, but he thought lightly of them and hoped to be remembered by
   his Latin writings. [998] He was an enthusiast for the literature of
   antiquity and gave a great impulse to its study. His parents, exiled
   from Florence, removed to Avignon, then the seat of the papacy, which
   remained Francesco's residence till 1333. He was ordained to the
   priesthood but without an inward call. He enjoyed several
   ecclesiastical benefices as prior, canon and archdeacon, which provided
   for his support without burdening him with duties. He courted and
   enjoyed the favor of princes, popes and prelates. He abused the papal
   residence on the Rhone as the Babylon of the West, urged the popes to
   return to Rome and hailed Cola da Rienzo as an apostle of national
   liberty. His writings contain outbursts of patriotism but, on the other
   hand, the author seems to contradict himself in being quick to accept
   the hospitality of the Italian despots of Mantua, Padua, Rimini and
   Ferrara, and the viconti of Milan. In 1350, he formed a friendship with
   Boccaccio which remained warm until his death.

   In spite of his priestly vows, Petrarca lived with concubines and had
   at least two illegitimate children, Giovanni and Francesca, the stain
   of whose birth was removed by papal bulls. In riper years, and more
   especially after his pilgrimage to Rome in the Jubilee year, 1350, he
   broke away from the slavery of sin. "I now hate that pestilence," he
   wrote to Boccaccio, "infinitely more than I loved it once, so that in
   turning over the thought of it in my mind, I feel shame and horror.
   Jesus Christ, my liberator, knows that I say the truth, he to whom I
   often prayed with tears, who has given to me his hand in pity and
   helped me up to himself." He took great delight in the Confessions of
   St. Augustine, a copy of which he carried about with him.

   In his De contemptu mundi,--the Contempt of the World, written in 1343,
   Petrarca confesses as his greatest fault the love of glory and the
   desire for the immortality of his name. This, the besetting sin of the
   ancient Greeks and Romans, the Humanists inherited. It became with them
   a ruling passion. They found it in Cicero, the most read of all the
   Latin classics. Dante strove after the poet's laurel and often returned
   to the theme of fame as a motive of action--lo grand disio della
   eccelenza. [999] Petrarca, after much seeking on his own part, was
   offered the poet's crown by the University of Paris and the Roman
   senate. He took it from the latter, and was crowned on the Capitoline
   Hill at Rome, April 8, 1341, Robert, king of Sicily, being present on
   the occasion. This he regarded as the proudest moment of his life, the
   excelling glory of his career. In ostentatious piety the poet carried
   his crown to St. Peter's, where he laid it on the altar of the Apostle.

   Petrarca has been called the first modern scholar and man of letters,
   the inaugurator of the Italian Renaissance. Unlike Dante, he despised
   scholastic and mystic learning and went further back to the well of
   pagan antiquity. He studied antiquity, not as a philologist or
   antiquarian, but as a man of taste. [1000] He admired the Greek and
   Roman authors for their eloquence, grace and finish of style. Cicero
   and Virgil were his idols, the fathers of eloquence, the eyes of the
   Latin language. He turned to Plato. He made a distinction between the
   religion of the New Testament as interpreted by Augustine and as
   interpreted by the Schoolmen. Petrarca also opened the period of search
   and discovery of ancient books and works of art. He spared no pains to
   secure old manuscripts. In 1345, he found several of Cicero's letters
   at Verona, and also a portion of Quintilian which had been unknown
   since the 10th century. A copy of Homer he kept with care, though be
   could not read its contents. All the Greek he knew was a few rudiments
   learned from a faithless Calabrian, Barlaam. He was the first to
   collect a private library and had 200 volumes. His first thought in
   passing old convents was to hunt up books. He accumulated old coins and
   medals and advocated the preservation of ancient monumenta. He seems
   also to have outlined the first mediaeval map of Italy. [1001]

   Few authors have more fully enjoyed the benefit of their labors than
   Petrarca. He received daily letters of praise from all parts of Italy,
   from France, Germany and England. He expressed his satisfaction that
   the emperor of Byzantium knew him through his writings. Charles IV.
   invited him three times to Germany that he might listen to his
   eloquence and learn from him lessons of wisdom; and Pope Gregory XI. on
   hearing of his death, ordered good copies of all his books. The next
   generation honored him, not as the singer of Laura, the wife of
   another, whose beauty and loveliness he praised in passionate verse,
   [1002] but as the scholar and sage.

   The name of Giovanni Boccaccio, 1313-1375, the third of the triumvirate
   of the Italian luminaries of the 14th century, has also a distinct
   place in the transition from the Middle Ages to the age of the
   Renaissance. With his two great predecessors he was closely linked,
   with Dante as his biographer, with Petrarca as his warm friend. It was
   given to him to be the founder of easy and elegant Italian prose. The
   world has had few writers who can equal him in realistic narration.
   [1003] There is ground for the saying that Dante is admired, Petrarca
   praised, Boccaccio read. He also wrote poetry, but it does not
   constitute his claim to distinction.

   Certaldo, twenty miles from Florence, was probably Boccaccio's
   birthplace. He was the illegitimate son of a Florentine father and a
   Parisian mother. After spending six years in business and giving six to
   the law,--the whole period being looked upon by him later as lost
   time,--he devoted himself to literature. Several years he spent at the
   court of Naples, where he fell in love with Maria, the married daughter
   of King Robert, who yielded her honor to his advances. Later, he
   represented her passion for him in L'amorosa Fiammetta. Thus the three
   great Italian literati commemorate the love of women who were bound in
   matrimony to others, but there is a wide gulf between the inspiring
   passion of Dante for Beatrice and Boccaccio's sensual love. [1004]
   Boccaccio was an unmarried layman and freely indulged in irregular
   love. His three children of unknown mothers died before him.

   In his old age he passed, like Petrarca, through a certain conversion,
   and, with a preacher's fervor, warned others against the vanity, luxury
   and seductive arts of women. He would fain have blotted out the
   immoralities of his writings when it was too late. The conversion was
   brought about by a Carthusian monk who called upon him at Certaldo.
   Upon the basis of another monk's vision, he threatened Boccaccio with
   speedy death, if he did not abandon his godless writing. Terrified with
   the prospect, he determined to renounce the pen and give himself up to
   penance. Petrarca, on hearing of his state of mind, wrote to him to
   accept what was good in the monk's advice, but not to abandon studies
   which he pronounced the nutriment of a healthy mind.

   In zeal for the ancient classics, Boccaccio vied with his contemporary.
   Many of them he copied with his own hand, and bequeathed them to his
   father-confessor in trust for the Augustinian convent of the Holy
   Spirit in Florence. He learned the elements of Greek and employed a
   Greek of Calabria, Leontius Pilatus, to make a literal translation of
   the Iliad and Odyssey for learners. An insight into his interest in
   books is given to us in his account of a visit to Monte Casino. On
   asking to see the library, a monk took him to a dusty room without a
   door to it, and with grass growing in its windows. Many of the
   manuscripts were mutilated. The monks, as his guide told him, were in
   the habit of tearing out leaves to be used by the children as psalters
   or to be sold to women for amulets for their arms.

   In 1373, the signoria of Florence appointed him to the lectureship on
   the Divina Commedia, with a salary of 100 guldens gold. He had gotten
   only as far as the 17th canto of the Inferno when he was overtaken by
   death.

   Boccaccio's Latin works are mostly compilations from ancient
   mythology--De genealogia deorum -- and biography, and also treat the
   subject of geography--De montium, silvarum, lacuum et marium nominibus.
   In his De claris mulieribus, he gave the biographies of 104
   distinguished women, including Eve, the fictitious popess, Johanna, and
   Queen Johanna of Naples, who was still living. His most popular work is
   the Decamerone, the Ten Days' Book--which in later years he would have
   destroyed or purged of its immoral and frivolous elements. It is his
   poetry in prose and may be called a Commedia Humana, as contrasted with
   Dante's Commedia Divina. It contains 100 stories, told by ten young
   persons, seven ladies and three men of Florence, during the pestilence
   of 1348. After listening to a description of the horrors of the plague,
   the reader is transferred to a beautiful garden, several miles from the
   city, where the members of the company, amid laughter and tears, relate
   the stories which range from moral tales to indecent love intrigues.
   One of the well-known stories is of the Jew, Abraham, who, refusing to
   comply with the appeals to turn Christian, went to Rome to study the
   question for himself. Finding the priestly morals most corrupt,
   cardinals with concubines and revelling in riches and luxury, he
   concluded Christianity must have a divine origin, or it would not have
   survived when the centre of Christendom was so rotten, and he offered
   himself for baptism. The Decamerone reveals a low state of morals among
   priests and monks as well as laymen and women. It derides marriage, the
   confessional, the hypocrisy of monkery and the worship of relics. The
   employment of wit and raillery against ecclesiastical institutions was
   a new element in literature, and Boccaccio wrote in a language the
   people understood. No wonder that the Council of Trent condemned the
   work for its immoralities, and still more for its anticlerical and
   antimonastic ridicule; but it could not prevent its circulation. A
   curious expurgated edition, authorized by the pope, appeared in
   Florence in 1573, which retained the indecencies, the impure
   personages, but substituted laymen for the priests and monks, thus
   saving the honor of the Church. [1005]

   Dante, Petrarca and Boccaccio led the way to a recognition of the worth
   of man's natural endowment by depicting the passions of his heart. To
   them also it belonged to have an ardent love for nature and to
   reproduce it in description. Thus Petrarca described the mountains and
   the gulfs of the sea as well as Rome, Naples and other Italian places
   where he loved to be. [1006] His description of his delight in
   ascending a mountain near Vaucluse, it has been suggested, was the
   first of its kind in literature. In these respects, the appreciation of
   man and the world, they stood at the opening of the new era.

   § 64. Progress and Patrons of Classical Studies in the 15th Century.

   The enthusiasm for classical studies and the monuments of antiquity
   reached its high pitch in Italy in the middle and latter half of the
   15th century. Many distinguished classical students appeared, none of
   whom, however, approached in literary eminence the three Italian
   literati of the preceding century. Admirable as was their zeal in
   promoting an acquaintance with the writers of Greece and Rome, they
   were in danger of becoming mere pedants and imitators of the past. The
   whole field of ancient literature was searched, poetry and philosophy,
   letters and works of geography and history. Italy seemed to be bent on
   setting aside all other studies for the ancient classics. Cicero was
   taken as the supreme model of style, and his age was referred to as
   "that immortal and almost heavenly age." [1007]

   The services of the Italian Humanists in reviving an interest in
   ancient literature and philosophy were, however, quite enough to give
   distinction to their era, though their own writings have ceased to be
   read. One new feature of abiding significance was developed in the 15th
   century, the science of literary and historical criticism. This was
   opened by Salutato, d. 1406, who contended that Seneca could not have
   been the author of the tragedies ascribed to him, and culminated in
   Laurentius Valla and the doubts that scholar cast upon the authorship
   of the Apostles' Creed and the Donation of Constantine. The Fall of
   Constantinople in 1453, with which the middle of the century was
   signalized, cannot be regarded as more than an incident in the history
   of the spread of Greek letters in the West, which would have been
   accomplished had the city remained under the Greek emperors.

   To the discovery and copying of manuscripts, led by such men as Poggio
   or the monk Nicolas of Treves, who in 1429 brought to Rome 12 hitherto
   unpublished comedies of Plautus, were added the foundation of princely
   libraries in Florence, Rome, Urbino and other cities. Numerous were the
   translations of Greek authors made into Latin, and more numerous the
   translations from both languages into Italian. By the recovery of a
   lost or half-forgotten literature, the Italian Renaissance laid the
   modern world under a heavy debt. But in its restless literary activity,
   it went still further, imitating the literary forms received from
   antiquity. Orations became a marked feature of the time, pompous and
   stately. The envoys of princes were called orators and receptions,
   given to such envoys, were opened with classical addresses. Orations
   were also delivered at the reception of relics, at funerals and--the
   epithalamials--and even at the consecration of bishops. At a betrothal,
   Filelfo opened his address with the words, "Aristotle, the peripatetic
   teacher." The orations of this Latinist, most eminent in his day, are
   pronounced by Geiger a disgusting mixture of classic and biblical
   quotations. [1008] Not seldom these ornate productions were extended to
   two or three hours. Pius II.'s fame for oratory helped him to the papal
   throne.

   All forms of classic poetry were revived--from the epic to the epigram,
   from tragedy to satire. Petrarca's Africa, an epic on Scipio, and
   Boccaccio's Theseid led the way. Attempts were even made to continue or
   restore ancient literary works. Maffeo Vegio, under Martin V., composed
   a 13th book of Virgil, Bruni restored the second decade of Livy. The
   poets not only revived the ancient mythologies but peopled Italy with
   new gods and nymphs. Especially active were they in celebrating the
   glories of the powerful men of their age, princes and popes. A Borgiad
   was dedicated to Alexander VI., a Borsead to Borso, duke of Este, a
   Sforzias to one of the viconti of Milan and the Laurentias to Lorenzo
   de' Medici. The most offensive panegyric of all was the poetical
   effusion of Ercole Strozzi at the death of Caesar Borgia. In this
   laudation, Roma is represented as having placed her hopes in the
   Borgias, Calixtus III. and Alexander VI., and last of all in Caesar,
   whose deeds are then glorified.

   In historic composition also, a new chapter was opened. The annals of
   cities and the careers of individuals were studied and written down.
   The histories of Florence, first in Latin by Lionardo Bruni and then
   down to 1362 by the brothers Villani, who wrote in Italian, and then by
   Poggio to 1455, were followed by other histories down to the valuable
   Diaries of Rome by Infessura and Burchard, the History of Venice,
   1487-1513, by Bembo, and the works of Machiavelli and Guicciardini, who
   wrote in Italian. In 1463, Flavio Biondo compiled his encyclopaedic
   work in three parts on the history, customs, topography and monuments
   of Rome and Italy, Roma instaurata, Roma triumphans and Italia
   illustrata. Lionardo Bruni wrote Lives of Cicero and Aristotle in Latin
   and of Dante and Petrarca in Italian. The passion for composition was
   displayed in the despatches of Venetian, Mantuan and other ambassadors
   at the courts of Rome or Este and by the elaborate letters, which were
   in reality finished essays, for the most part written in Latin and
   introducing comments on books and matters of literary interest, by
   Politian, Bembo and others, a form of writing revived by Petrarca. The
   zeal for Latin culture also found exhibition in the habit of giving to
   children ancient names, such as Agamemnon and Achilles, Atalanta and
   Pentesilea. A painter called his daughter Minerva and his son Apelles.
   The habit also took root of assuming Latin names. A Sanseverino,
   howbeit of illegitimate birth, proudly called himself Julius Pomponius
   Laetus. This custom extended to Germany, where Schwarzerd gave up his
   original German patronymic for Melanchthon, Hausschein for
   Oecolampadius, Reuchlin for Capnio, Buchmann for Bibliander; Hutten,
   Luther, Zwingli, who were more patriotic, adhered to their vernacular
   names. Pedants adopted a more serious change when they paganized sacred
   terms and substituted mythological for Christian ideas. The saints were
   called dii and deae; their statues, simulacra sancta deorum; holy
   images of the gods, Peter and Paul, dii titulares Romae or S. Romulus
   and S. Remus; the nuns, vestales virgines; heaven, Olympus; cardinals,
   augurs, and the College of Cardinals, Senatus sacer; the pope, pontifex
   maximus, and his thunders, dirae; the tiara, infula Romulea; and God,
   Jupiter optimus Maximus! [1009] Erasmus protested against such absurd
   pedantry as characterizing Humanism in its dotage. Another sign of the
   cult of the ancients was the imitation of Roman burial usages even in
   the churches. At Bruni's death in 1443, the priors of Florence decreed
   him a public, funeral "after the manner of the ancients." Before the
   laying-away of his body in S. Croce, Manetti pronounced a funeral
   oration and placed the crown of laurel on the deceased author's head.

   The high veneration of antiquity was also shown in the regard which
   cities and individuals paid to the relics of classical writers. Padua
   thought she had the genuine bones of Livy, and Alfonso of Naples
   considered himself happy in securing one of the arms of the dead
   historian. Naples gloried in the real or supposed tomb of Virgil. Parma
   boasted of the bones of Cassius. Como claimed both the Plinies, but
   Verona proved that the elder belonged to it. Alfonso of Naples, as he
   was crossing over the Abruzzi, saluted Sulmona, the birthplace of Ovid.

   The larger Italian towns were not without Latin schools. Among the
   renowned teachers were Vittorino da Feltre, whom Gonzaga of Mantua
   called to his court, and Guarino of Verona. Children of princes from
   abroad went to Mantua to sit at the feet of Feltre, who also gave
   instruction to as many as 70 poor and talented children at a time.
   Latin authors were committed to memory and translated by the pupils,
   and mathematics and philosophy were taught. To his literary curriculum
   Feltre added gymnastic exercises and set his pupils a good example by
   his chastity and temperance. He was represented as a pelican which
   nourishes her young with her own blood. Pastor, who calls this teacher
   the greatest Italian pedagogue of the Renaissance period, is careful to
   notice that he had mass said every morning before beginning the
   sessions of the day.

   The Humanists were fortunate in securing the encouragement of the rich
   and powerful. Literature has never had more liberal and intelligent
   patrons than it had in Italy in the 15th century. The munificence of
   Maecenas was equalled and surpassed by Cosimo and Lorenzo de'Medici in
   Florence and Nicolas V. in Rome. Other cities had their literary
   benefactors, but some of these were most noted for combining profligacy
   with their real or affected interest in literary culture. Humanists
   were in demand. Popes needed secretaries, and princes courted orators
   and poets who could conduct a polished correspondence, write addresses,
   compose odes for festive occasions and celebrate their deeds. Lionardo
   Bruni, Valla, Bembo, Sadoleto and other Humanists were secretaries or
   annotators at the papal court under Nicolas V. and his successors.

   Cosimo de' Medici, d. 1464, the most munificent promoter of arts and
   letters that Europe had seen for more than a thousand years, was the
   richest banker of the republic of Florence, scholarly, well-read and,
   from taste and ambition, deeply interested in literature. We have
   already met him at Constance during the council. He travelled
   extensively in France and Germany and ruled Florence, after a temporary
   exile, as a republican merchant-prince, for 30 years. He encouraged
   scholars by gifts of money and provided for the purchase of
   manuscripts, without assuming the air of condescension which spoils the
   generosity of the gift, but with a feeling of respect for superior
   merit. His literary minister, Nicolo de' Niccoli, 1364-1437, was a
   centre of attraction to literary men in Florence and collected and, in
   great part, copied 800 codices. Under his auspices, Poggio searched
   some of the South German convents and found at St. Gall the first
   complete Quintilian. Niccoli's library, through Cosimo's mediation, was
   given to S. Marco, and forms a part of the Medicean library. With the
   same enlightened liberality, Cosimo also encouraged the fine arts. He
   was a great admirer of the saintly painter, Fra Angelico, whom he
   ordered to paint the history of the crucifixion on one of the walls of
   the chapter-house of S. Marco. Among the scholars protected in Florence
   under Cosimo's administration were the Platonist Ficino, Lionardo Bruni
   and Poggio. During the last year of his life, Cosimo had read to him
   Aristotle's Ethics and Ficino's translation of Plato's The Highest
   Good. He also contributed to churches and convents, and by the erection
   of stately buildings turned Florence into the Italian Athens.

   Cosimo's grandson and worthy successor, Lorenzo de' Medici, d. 1492,
   was well educated in Latin and Greek by Landino, Argyropulos and
   Ficino. He was a man of polite culture and himself no mean poet, whose
   songs were sung on the streets of Florence. His family life was
   reputable. He liked to play with his children and was very fond of his
   son Giovanni, afterwards Leo X. Michelangelo and Pico della Mirandola
   were among the ornaments of his court. By his lavish expenditures he
   brought himself and the republic to the brink of bankruptcy in 1490.

   Federigo da Montefeltro, duke of Urbino, d. 1482, and Alfonso of Naples
   also deserve special mention as patrons of learning. Federigo, a pupil
   of Vittorino da Feltre, was a scholar and an admirer of patristic as
   well as classical learning. He also cultivated a taste for music,
   painting and architecture, employed 30 and 40 copyists at a time, and
   founded, at an expense of 40,000 ducats, a library which, in 1657, was
   incorporated in the Vatican.

   Alfonso was the special patron of the skeptical Laurentius Valla and
   the licentious Beccadelli, 1394-1471, and also had at his court the
   Greek scholars, George of Trebizond and the younger Chrysoloras. He
   listened with delight to literary, philosophical and theological
   lectures and disputes, which were held in his library. He paid large
   sums for literary work, giving Beccadelli 1000 gold guldens for his
   Hermaphrodita, and Fazio, in addition to his yearly stipend of 500
   guldens, 1,500 guldens for his Historia Alphonsi. When he took Manetti
   to be his secretary, he is reported to have said he would be willing to
   divide his last crust with scholars.

   With Nicolas V., 1447-1455, Humanism triumphed at the centre of the
   Roman Church. He was the first and best pope of the Renaissance and its
   most liberal supporter. However, Humanism never struck as deep root in
   Rome as it did in Florence. It was always more or less of an exotic in
   the papal city. [1010] Nicolas caught the spirit of the Renaissance in
   Florence, where he served as private tutor. For 20 years he acted as
   the secretary of Cardinal Niccolo Abergati, and travelled in France,
   England, Burgundy, Germany and Northern Italy. On these journeys he
   collected rare books, among which were Lactantius, Gregory of
   Nazianzus, Irenaeus, 12 epistles of Ignatius and an epistle of
   Polycarp. Many manuscripts he copied with his own hand, and he helped
   to arrange the books Cosimo collected. His pontificate was a golden era
   for architects and authors. With the enormous sums which the year of
   Jubilee, 1450, brought to Rome, he was able to carry out his double
   passion for architecture and literature. In the bank of the Medici
   alone, 100,000 florins were deposited to the account of the papacy.
   Nicolas gave worthy scholars employment as transcribers, translators or
   secretaries, but he made them work night and day. He sent agents to all
   parts of Italy and to other countries, even to Russia and England, in
   search of rare books, and had them copied on parchment and luxuriously
   bound and clasped with silver clasps. He thus collected the works of
   Homer, Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Plato, Aristotle, Polybius,
   Diodorus Siculus, Appian, Philo Judaeus, and the Greek Fathers,
   Eusebius, Basil, Gregory of Nazianzus, Chrysostom, Cyril and Dionysius
   the Areopagite. He kindled a feverish enthusiasm for the translation of
   Greek authors, and was determined to enrich the West with versions of
   all the surviving monuments of Hellenic literature. As Symonds puts it,
   Rome became a factory of translations from Greek into Latin. Nicolas
   paid to Valla 500 scudi for a Latin version of Thucydides and to
   Guarino 1,500 for his translation of Strabo. He presented to Nicolas
   Perotti for his translation of Polybius a purse of 500 new papal
   ducats,--a ducat being the equivalent of 12 francs,--with the remark
   that the sum was not equal to the author's merits. He offered 5,000
   ducats for the discovery of the Hebrew Matthew and 10,000 gold gulden
   for a translation of Homer, but in vain; for Marsuppini and Oratius
   only furnished fragments of the Iliad, and Valla's translation of the
   first 16 books was a paraphrase in prose. He gave Manetti, his
   secretary and biographer, though absent from Rome, a salary of 600
   ducats. No such liberal and enlightened friend of books ever sat in the
   chair of St. Peter.

   Nicolas found an enduring monument in the Vatican Library, which, with
   its later additions, is the most valuable collection in the world of
   rare manuscripts in Oriental, Greek, Latin and ecclesiastical
   literature. Among its richest treasures is the Vatican manuscript of
   the Greek New Testament. There had been older pontifical libraries and
   collections of archives, first in the Lateran, afterwards in the
   Vatican palace, but Nicolas well deserves to be called the founder of
   the Vatican Library. He bought for it about 5,000 volumes of valuable
   classical and biblical manuscripts,--an enormous collection for those
   days,--and he had besides a private library, consisting chiefly of
   Latin classics. No other library of that age reached 1,000 volumes.
   Bessarion had only 600 volumes, Niccoli in Florence 800, Federigo of
   Urbino 772. The Vatican now contains 30,000 manuscripts and about
   100,000 printed works. Free access was offered to its archives for the
   first time by Leo XIII.

   The interest of the later popes of the Renaissance period was given to
   art and architecture rather than to letters. The Spaniard, Calixtus
   III., according to the doubtful report of Vespasiano, regarded the
   accumulation of books by his predecessor as a waste of the treasures of
   the Church of God, gave away several hundred volumes to the old
   Cardinal Isidore of Kiew and melted the silver ornaments, with which
   many manuscripts were bound, into coin for his proposed war against the
   Turks.

   From the versatile diplomatist and man of letters, Pius II., the
   Humanists had a right to expect much, but they got little. This,
   however, was not because Eneas Sylvius had reason to fear rivalry.
   After being elected pope, he was carried about the city of Rome and to
   Tusculum, Alba, Ostia and other localities, tracing the old Roman roads
   and water conduits and examining other monuments. He was a poet,
   novelist, controversialist, historian, cosmographer. He had a heart for
   everything, from the boat-race and hunting-party to the wonders of
   great cities, Florence and Rome. His faculty of observation was as keen
   as his interests were broad. Nothing seems to have escaped his eye.
   Everything that was human had an interest for him, and his description
   of cities and men, as in his Frederick III and History of Bohemia, hold
   the reader's attention by their clever judgments and their appreciation
   of characteristic and entertaining details. [1011] Pius' novels and
   odes breathe a low moral atmosphere, and his comedy, Chrisis, in the
   style of Terence, deals with women of ill-repute and is equal to the
   most lascivious of the Humanistic productions. His orations fill three
   volumes, and over 500 of his letters are still extant.

   Under Paul II., the Humanists of the papal household had hard times, as
   the treatment of Platina shows. Sixtus IV., 1471-1484, has a place in
   the history of the Vatican library, which he transferred to four new
   and beautiful halls. He endowed it with a permanent fund, provided for
   Latin, Greek and Hebrew copyists, appointed as librarians two noted
   scholars, Bussi and Platina, and separated the books from the archives.
   [1012] The light-hearted Leo X., a normal product of the Renaissance,
   honored Bembo and other literati, but combined the patronage of
   frivolous with serious literature. In a letter printed in the first
   edition of the first six books of the Annals of Tacitus,
   1515,--discovered in the Westphalian convent of Corbay, 1508,--he wrote
   that "from his earliest years he had been accustomed to think that, if
   we except the knowledge and worship of God Himself, nothing more
   excellent or more useful had been given by the Creator to mankind than
   classical studies which not only lead to the ornament and guidance of
   human life, but are applicable and useful to every particular
   situation."

   As a characteristic development of the Italian Renaissance must be
   mentioned the so-called academies of Florence, Rome and Naples. These
   institutions corresponded somewhat to our modern scientific
   associations. The most noted of them, the Platonic Academy of Florence,
   was founded by Cosimo de' Medici, and embraced among its members the
   principal men of Florence and some strangers. It celebrated the
   birthday of Plato, November 13, with a banquet and a discussion of his
   writings. It revived and diffused the knowledge of the sublime truths
   of Platonism, and then gave way to other academies in Florence of a
   more literary and social character. [1013] Its brightest fame was
   reached under Lorenzo.

   The academy at Rome, which had Pomponius Laetus for its founder, did
   not confine itself to the study of Plato and philosophy, but had a more
   general literary aim. The meetings were devoted to classical
   discussions and the presentation of orations and plays. Although Laetus
   was half a pagan, Alexander VI. was represented at his funeral, 1498,
   by members of his court. Cardinal Sadoleto in the 16th century reckoned
   the Roman academy among the best teachers of his youth. The academy at
   Naples, developed by Jovianus Pontanus, devoted itself chiefly to
   matters of style. The Florentine academy has been well characterized by
   Professor Jebb as predominantly philosophic, the Roman as antiquarian
   and the Neapolitan as literary. [1014]

   § 65. Greek Teachers and Italian Humanists.

   The revival of the study of Greek, which had been neglected for eight
   centuries or more, was due, not to an interest in the original text of
   the New Testament, but to a passion to become acquainted with Homer,
   Plato and other classic Greek authors. Not even had Gregory the Great
   any knowledge of the language. The erection of chairs for its study was
   recommended by the Council of Vienne, but the recommendation came to
   nothing. The revival of the study of the language was followed by the
   discovery of Greek manuscripts, the preparation of grammars and
   dictionaries and the translation of the Greek classics.

   If we pass by such itinerating and uncertain teachers as the
   Calabrians, from whom Petrarca and Boccaccio took lessons, the list of
   modern teachers of Greek opens with Emanuel Chrysoloras, 1350-1415. He
   taught in Florence, Milan, Padua, Venice and Rome and, having conformed
   to the Latin Church, was taken as interpreter to the council at
   Constance, where he died. He wrote the first Greek grammar, printed in
   1484. The first lexicon was prepared by a Carmelite monk, Giovanni
   Crastone of Piacenza, and appeared in 1497. Provided as we are with a
   full apparatus for the study of Greek, we have little conception of the
   difficulty of acquiring a book-knowledge of that language without the
   elementary helps of grammar and dictionary.

   A powerful impetus was given to Greek studies by the Council of
   Ferrara, 1439, with its large delegation from the Eastern Church and
   its discussions over the doctrinal differences of Christendom. Its
   proceedings appeared in the two languages. Among those who attended the
   council and remained in the West for a period or for life, were
   Plethon, whose original name was Georgios Gemistos, 1355-1450, and
   Bessarion, 1403-1472. Cosimo de' Medici heard Plethon often and was led
   by his lectures on Plato to conceive the idea of the Platonic Academy
   in Florence.

   Bessarion, bishop of Nicaea, became a fixture in the Latin Church and
   was admitted to the college of cardinals by Eugenius IV. The objection
   made in conclave to his candidacy for the papal chair by the cardinal
   of Avignon was that he was a Greek and wore a beard. He died in
   Ravenna. Like all Greeks, Bessarion was a philosophical theologian, and
   took more interest in the metaphysical mystery of the eternal
   procession of the Spirit than the practical work of the Spirit upon the
   hearts of men. He vindicated Plato against the charges of immorality
   and alleged hostility to orthodox doctrines, pointed to that
   philosopher's belief in the creation and the immortality of the soul,
   quoted the favorable opinions of him given by Basil, Augustine and
   other Fathers, and represented him as a bridge from heathenism to
   Christianity. Bessarion's palace in Rome was a meeting-place of
   scholars. At an expense of 15,000 ducats or, as Platina says, 30,000,
   he collected a valuable library which he gave, in 1468, to the republic
   of Venice. [1015]

   George of Trebizond, 1395-1484, came to Italy about 1420, conformed to
   the papal church, taught eloquence and the Aristotelian philosophy in
   Venice and Rome, and was appointed an apostolic scribe by Nicolas V. He
   was a conceited, disputatious and irascible man and quarrelled with
   Valla, Poggio, Theodore of Gaza, Bessarion and Perotti. The 50 scudi
   which Sixtus IV. gave him for the translation of Aristotle's History of
   Animals, he contemptuously threw into the Tiber. His chief work was a
   comparison of Aristotle and Plato, to the advantage of the former.

   Theodore of Gaza, George's rival, was a native of Thessalonica, reached
   Italy 1430, taught in Ferrara and then passed into the service of Pope
   Nicolas. He was a zealous Platonist, and translated several Greek works
   into Latin and some of Cicero's works into Greek and also wrote a Greek
   grammar.

   John Argyropulos, an Aristotelian philosopher and translator, taught 15
   years with great success at Florence, and then at Rome, where Reuchlin
   heard him lecture on Thucydides. His death, 1486, was brought about by
   excess in eating melons.

   The leading Greeks, who emigrated to Italy after the fall of
   Constantinople, were Callistus, Constantine Lascaris and his son John.
   John Andronicus Callistus taught Greek at Bologna and at Rome,
   1454-1469, and took part in the disputes between the Platonists and
   Aristotelians. Afterwards he removed to Florence and last to France, in
   the hope of better remuneration. He is said to have read all the Greek
   authors and imported six chests of manuscripts from Greece. Constantine
   Lascaris, who belonged to a family of high rank in the Eastern empire,
   gave instruction in the Greek language to Ippolita, the daughter of
   Francis Sforza, and later the wife of Alfonso, son of Ferdinand I. of
   Naples. He composed a Greek grammar for her, the first book printed in
   Greek, 1476. In 1470, he moved to Messina, where he established a
   flourishing school, and died near the close of the century. Among his
   pupils was Cardinal Bembo of Venice.

   His son, John Lascaris, 1445-1535, was employed by Lorenzo de' Medici
   to collect manuscripts in Greece, and superintended the printing of
   Greek books in Florence. He accompanied Charles VIII. to France. In
   1513, he was called by Leo X. to Rome, and opened there a Greek and
   Latin school. In 1518, he returned to France and collected a library
   for Francis I. at Fontainebleau.

   Among those who did distinguished service in collecting Greek
   manuscripts was Giovanni Aurispa, 1369-1459, who went to Constantinople
   in his youth to study Greek, and bought and sold with the shrewdness of
   an experienced bookseller. In 1423, he returned from Constantinople
   with 238 volumes, including Sophocles, Aeschylus, Plato, Xenophon,
   Plutarch, Lucian. Thus these treasures were saved from ruthless
   destruction by the Turks, before the catastrophe of 1453 overtook
   Constantinople.

   The study of Greek suffered a serious decline in Italy after the close
   of the 15th century, but was taken up and carried to a more advanced
   stage by the Humanists north of the Alps.

   The study of Hebrew, which had been preserved in Europe by Jewish
   scholars, notably in Spain, was also revived in Italy in the 15th
   century, but its revival met with opposition. When Lionardo Bruni heard
   that Poggio was learning the language, he wrote contending that the
   study was not only unprofitable but positively hurtful. Manetti, the
   biographer of Nicolas V., translated the Psalms out of Hebrew and made
   a collection of Hebrew manuscripts for that pontiff. The Camalduensian
   monk, Traversari, learned the language and, in 1475, began the printing
   of Hebrew books on Italian presses. Chairs for the study of Hebrew were
   founded at Bologna, 1488, and in Rome 1514.

   Passing from the list of the Greek teachers to the Italian Humanists,
   it is possible to select for mention here only a few of the more
   prominent names, and with special reference to their attitude to the
   Church.

   Lionardo Bruni, 1369-1444, a pupil of Chrysoloras, gives us an idea of
   the extraordinary sensation caused by the revival of the Greek
   language. He left all his other studies for the language of Plato and
   Demosthenes. He was papal secretary in Rome and for a time chancellor
   of Florence, and wrote letters, orations, histories, philosophical
   essays and translations from the Greek, among them Aristotle's Ethics,
   Politics and Economies, and Plato's Phaedo, Crito, Apology, Phaedrus
   and Gorgias and his Epistles and six of Plutarch's Lives. Foreigners
   went to Florence expressly to see his face. He was a pious Catholic.
   [1016]

   Francesco Poggio Bracciolini, 1380-1459, was secretary of Martin V.,
   then of Nicolas V., and lived mostly in Florence and Rome. [1017] He
   was the most widely known Humanist of his day and had an unbounded
   passion for classical antiquity and for literary controversy. He
   excelled chiefly in Latin, but knew also Greek and a little Hebrew. He
   was an enthusiastic book-hunter. He went to Constance as papal
   secretary and, besides discovering a complete copy of Quintilian's
   Institutes, made search in the neighboring Benedictine abbeys of
   Reichenau and Weingarten for old manuscripts. In Cluny and other French
   convents he discovered new orations of Cicero. He also visited
   "barbarous England." Although in the service of the curia for nearly 50
   years, Poggio detested and ridiculed the monks and undermined respect
   for the church which supported him. In his Dialogue against Hypocrisy,
   he gathered a number of scandalous stories of the tricks and frauds
   practised by monks in the name of religion. His bold description of the
   martyrdom of the heretic Jerome of Prag has already been cited. When
   Felix was elected, Poggio exhausted the dictionary for abusive terms
   and called the anti-pope another Cerberus, a golden calf, a roaring
   lion, a high-priest of malignity; and he did equally well for the
   Council of Basel, which had elected Felix. Poggio's self-esteem and
   quick temper involved him in endless quarrels, and invectives have
   never had keener edge than those which passed between him and his
   contestants. To his acrid tongue were added loose habits. He lived with
   a concubine, who bore him 14 children, and, when reproached for it, he
   frivolously replied that he only imitated the common habit of the
   clergy. At the age of 54, he abandoned her and married a Florentine
   maiden of 18, by whom he had 4 children. His Facetiae, or Jest-Book, a
   collection of obscene stories, acquired immense popularity.

   The general of the Camalduensian order, Ambrogio Traversari, 1386-1439,
   combined ascetic piety with interest in heathen literature. He
   collected 238 manuscripts in Venice and translated from the Greek
   Fathers. He was, perhaps, the first Italian monk from the time of
   Jerome to his own day who studied Hebrew.

   Carlo Marsuppini, of Arezzo, hence called Carlo Aretino, belonged to
   the same circle, but was an open heathen, who died without confession
   and sacrament. He was nevertheless highly esteemed as a teacher and as
   chancellor of Florence, and honorably buried in the church of S. Croce,
   1463, where a monument was erected to his memory.

   Francesco Filelfo, 1398-1481, was one of the first Latin and Greek
   scholars, and much admired and much hated by his contemporaries. He
   visited Greece, returned to Italy with a rich supply of manuscripts,
   and was professor of eloquence and Greek in the University of Florence.
   He combined the worst and best features of the Renaissance. He was
   conceited, mean, selfish, avaricious. He thought himself equal if not
   superior to Virgil and Cicero. In malignity and indecency of satire and
   invective be rivalled Poggio. His poisonous tongue got him into
   scandalous literary feuds with Niccolo, Poggio, members of the Medici
   family and others. He was banished from Florence, but, recalled in his
   old days by Lorenzo, he died a few weeks after his return, aged 83. He
   was always begging or levying contributions on princes for his poetry,
   and he kept several servants and six horses. His 3 wives bore him 24
   children. He was ungrateful to his benefactors and treacherous to his
   friends. [1018]

   Marsilio Ficino, 1433-1499, one of the circle who made the court of
   Lorenzo the Magnificent famous, was an ordained priest, rector of two
   churches and canon of the cathedral of Florence. He eloquently preached
   the Platonic gospel to his "brethren in Plato," and translated the
   Orphic hymns, the Hermes Trismegistos, and some works of Plato and
   Plotinus,--a colossal task for that age. He believed that the divine
   Plotinus had first revealed the theology of the divine Plato and "the
   mysteries of the ancients," and that these were consistent with
   Christianity. Yet he was unable to find in Plato's writings the mystery
   of the Trinity. He wrote a defence of the Christian religion, which he
   regarded as the only true religion, and a work on the immortality of
   the soul, which he proved with 15 arguments as against the
   Aristotelians. He was small and sickly, and kept poor by dishonest
   servants and avaricious relations.

   Politian, to his edition of Justinian's Pandects, added translations of
   Epictetus, Hippocrates, Galen and other authors, and published among
   lecture-courses those on Ovid, Suetonius, Pliny and Quintilian. His
   lecture-room extended its influence to England and Germany, and Grocyn,
   Linacre and Reuchlin were among his hearers.

   Three distinguished Italian Humanists whose lives overlap the first
   period of the Reformation were cardinals, Pietro Bembo, 1470-1547,
   Giacopo Sadoleto, 1477-1547, and Aleander, 1480-1542. All were masters
   of an elegant Latin style. For 22 years Bembo lived in concubinage, and
   had three children. Cardinal Sadoleto is best known for his polite and
   astute letter calling upon the Genevans to abandon the Reformation, to
   which Calvin replied. [1019]

   Not without purpose have the two names, Laurentius Valla, 1406-1457,
   and Pico della Mirandola, 1463-1494, been reserved for the last. These
   men are to be regarded as having, among the Humanists of the 15th
   century, the most points of contact with our modern thought,--the one
   the representative of critical scholarship, the other of broad human
   sympathies coupled with a warm piety.

   Laurentius Valla, the only Humanist of distinction born in Rome, taught
   at Pavia, was secretary to the king of Naples, and at last served at
   the court of Nicolas V. [1020] He held several benefices and was buried
   in the Lateran, but was a sceptic and an indirect advocate of Epicurean
   morality. He combined classical with theological erudition and attained
   an influence almost equal to that enjoyed by Erasmus several
   generations later. He was a born critic, and is one of the earliest
   pioneers of the right of private judgment. He broke loose from the
   bondage of scholastic tradition and an infallible Church authority, so
   that in this respect Bellarmin called him a forerunner of Luther.
   Luther, with an imperfect knowledge of Valla's works, esteemed him
   highly, declaring that in many centuries neither Italy nor the
   universal Church could produce another like him. [1021] He narrowly
   escaped the Inquisition. He denied to the monks the monopoly of being
   "the religious," and attacked their threefold vow. In his Annotations
   to the New Testament, published by Erasmus, 1505, he ventured to
   correct Jerome's Vulgate. He doubted the genuineness of the writings
   attributed to Dionysius the Areopagite and rejected as a forgery
   Christ's letter to King Abgarus which Eusebius had accepted as genuine.
   When he attacked the Apostolic origin of the Apostles' Creed and, about
   1440, exposed the Donation of Constantine as a fiction, he was calling
   in question the firm belief of centuries. In pronouncing the latter
   "contradictory, impossible, stupid, barbarous and ridiculous," [1022]
   he was wrenching a weapon, long used, out of the hand of the hierarchy.
   His attack was based on the ground of authentic history, inherent
   improbability and the mediaeval character of the language. Not
   satisfied with refuting its genuineness, Valla made it an occasion of
   an assault upon the whole temporal power of the papacy. He thus struck
   at the very bulwarks of the mediaeval theocracy. In boldness and
   violence Valla equalled the anti-papal writings of Luther. He went,
   indeed, not so far as to deny the spiritual power and divine
   institution of the papacy, but he charged the bishop of Rome with
   having turned Peter into Judas and having accepted the devil's offer of
   the kingdoms of this world. He made him responsible for the political
   divisions and miseries of Italy, for rebellions and civil wars, herein
   anticipating Machiavelli. He maintained that the princes had a right to
   deprive the pope of his temporal possessions, which he had long before
   forfeited by their abuse. The purity of Valla's motives are exposed to
   suspicion. At the time he wrote the tract he was in the service of
   Alfonso, who was engaged in a controversy with Eugenius IV.

   Unfortunately, Valla's ethical principles and conduct were no
   recommendation to his theology. His controversy with Poggio abounds in
   scandalous personalities. In the course of it, Valla was charged with
   seduction and pederasty. [1023] His Ciceronian Dialogues on Lust,
   written perhaps 1431, are an indirect attack upon Christian morality.
   Valla defended the Platonic community of wives. What nature demands is
   good and laudable, and the voice of nature is the voice of God. When he
   was charged by Poggio with having seduced his brother-in-law's maid, he
   admitted the charge without shame.

   Pico della Mirandola, the most precocious genius that had arisen since
   Duns Scotus, was cut down when he was scarcely 30 years of age. The
   Schoolman was far beyond him in dialectic subtlety, but was far
   inferior to him in independence of thought and, in this quality, Pico
   anticipated the coming age. He studied canon law, theology, philosophy
   and the humanities in Ferrara and learned also Hebrew, Chaldee and
   Arabic. [1024] In his twenty-third year, he went to Rome and published
   900 theses on miscellaneous topics, in which he anticipated some of the
   Protestant views; for example, that no image or cross should be adored
   and that the words "This is my body" must be understood
   symbolically,--significative,--not materially. He also maintained that
   the science of magic and the Cabbala confirm the doctrine of the
   Trinity and the deity of Christ. These opinions aroused suspicion, and
   13 of his theses were condemned by Innocent VIII. as heretical; but, as
   he submitted his judgment to the Church, he was acquitted of heresy,
   and Alexander VI. cleared him of all charges.

   To his erudition, Pico added sincere faith and ascetic tendencies. In
   the last years of his short life, he devoted himself to the study of
   the Bible with the purpose of preaching Christ throughout the world. He
   was an admirer of Savonarola, who blamed him for not becoming a full
   monk and thought he went to purgatory. Of all Humanists he had the
   loftiest conception of man's dignity and destiny. In his De dignitate
   hominis, he maintained that God placed man in the midst of the world
   that he might the more easily study all that therein is, and endowed
   him with freewill, by which he might degenerate into the condition of
   the beast or rise to a godlike existence. He found the highest truth in
   the Christian religion. He is the author of the famous sentence:
   Philosophia veritatem quaerit, theologia invenit, religio
   possidet,--philosophy seeks the truth, theology finds it, religion has
   it.

   Mirandola had a decided influence on John Reuchlin, who saw him in 1490
   and was persuaded by him of the immense wisdom hid in the Cabbala. He
   also was greatly admired by Zwingli. He was the only one, says
   Burckhardt, "who, in a decided voice, fought for science and the truth
   of all the ages against the one-sided emphasis of classic antiquity. In
   him it is possible to see what a noble change Italian philosophy would
   have undergone, if the counter-Reformation had not come in and put an
   end to the whole higher intellectual movement." [1025] Giordano Bruno,
   one of the last representatives of the philosophical Renaissance, was
   condemned as a heretic by the Roman Inquisition and burnt on the Campo
   de' Fiori in 1600. To the great annoyance of Pope Leo XIII., his
   admirers erected a statue to his memory on the same spot in 1889.

   § 66. The Artists.

   Haec est Italia diis sacra.--Pliny.

   Italian Humanism reproduced the past. Italian art was original. The
   creative productions of Italy in architecture, sculpture and painting
   continue to render it the world's chief centre of artistic study and
   delight. Among Italian authors, Dante alone has a place at the side of
   Michelangelo, Raphael and Lionardo da Vinci. The cultivation of art
   began in the age of Dante with Cimabue and Giotto, but when Italian
   Humanism was declining Italian painting and sculpture were celebrating
   their highest triumphs. Such a combination and succession of men of
   genius in the fine arts as Italy produced, in a period extending over
   three centuries, has nowhere else been known. They divided their
   triumphs between Florence and Rome, but imparted their magic touch to
   many other Italian cities, including Venice, which had remained cold to
   the literary movement. Here again Rome drew upon Florence for painters
   such as Giotto and Fra Angelico, and for sculptors such as Ghiberti,
   Donatello, Brunelleschi and Michelangelo.

   While the Italy of the 15th century--or the quattrocento, as the
   Italians call it--was giving expression to her own artistic conceptions
   in color and marble and churchly dome, masterpieces of ancient
   sculpture, restless, in the graves where for centuries they had had
   rude sepulture, came forth to excite the admiring astonishment of a new
   generation. What the age of Nicolas V. was for the discovery of
   manuscripts, the age of Julius II. was for the discovery of classic
   Greek statuary. The extensive villa of the Emperor Hadrian at Tivoli,
   which extended over several miles and embraced a theatre, lyceum,
   temple, basilica, library, and race-course, alone furnished immense
   treasures of art. Others were found in the bed of the Tiber or brought
   from Greece or taken from the Roman baths, where their worth had not
   been discerned. In Alexander VI.'s pontificate the Apollo Belvedere was
   found; under Julius II. the torso of Hercules, the Laocoön group [1026]
   and the Vatican Venus. The Greek ideals of human beauty were again
   revealed and kindled an enthusiasm for similar achievements.

   Petrarca's collections were repeated. Paul II. deposited his rich store
   of antiquities in his palace of San Marco. In Florence, Lorenzo de'
   Medici was active in securing pieces of ancient art. The museum on the
   Capitoline Hill in Rome, where Nicolas V. seems to have restored the
   entire palace of the senate, dates from 1471, one of its earliest
   treasures being the statue of Marcus Aurelius. The Vatican museum was
   the creation of Julius II. To these museums and the museums in Florence
   were added the galleries of private collectors.

   In architecture, the Renaissance artists never adopted the stern Gothic
   of the North. In 1452, Leon Battista Alberti showed to Nicolas V. a
   copy of his De re aedificatoria, a work on architecture, based upon his
   studies of the Roman monuments. Nicolas opened the line of great
   builders in Rome and his plans were on a splendid scale.

   The art of the Renaissance blends the glorification of mediaeval
   Catholicism with the charms of classical paganism, the history of the
   Bible with the mythology of Greece and Rome. The earlier painters of
   the 14th and 15th centuries were more simple, chaste and devout than
   those of the 16th, who reached a higher distinction as artists. The
   Catholic type of piety is shown in the preponderance of the pictures of
   the Madonna holding the infant Saviour in her arms or on her lap and in
   the portraiture of St. Sebastian and other saints. Heavenly beauty and
   earthly sensuality meet side by side, and the latter often draws
   attention away from the former. The same illustrious painters, says
   Hawthorne, in the Marble Faun, "seem to take up one task or the
   other--the disrobed woman whom they called Venus, or the type of
   highest and tenderest womanhood in the mother of their Saviour--with
   equal readiness, but to achieve the former with far more satisfactory
   success." One moment the painter represented Bacchus wedding Ariadne
   and another depicted Mary on the hill of Calvary. Michelangelo now
   furnished the Pietà for St. Peter's, now designed the Rape of Ganymede
   for Vittoria Colonna and the statue of the drunken Bacchus for the
   Roman Jacopo Galli. Titian's Magdalen in the Pitti gallery, Florence,
   exhibits in one person the voluptuous woman with exposed breasts and
   flowing locks and the penitent saint looking up to heaven. Of Sandro
   Botticelli, Vasari said that "in many homes he painted of naked women a
   plenty." If, however, the Christian religion furnished only to a single
   writer, Dante, the subject of his poem, it furnished to all the
   painters and sculptors many subjects from both Testaments and also from
   Church history, for the highest productions of their genius.

   In looking through the long list of distinguished sculptors, painters
   and architects who illuminated their native Italy in the Renaissance
   period, one is struck with the high age which many of them reached and,
   at the same time, with the brief period in which some of them acquired
   undying fame. Michelangelo lived to be 89, while Correggio died before
   he was 44. Titian, had he lived one year longer, would have rounded out
   a full century, while death took the brush out of Raphael's hand before
   he was 37, a marvellous example of production in a short period, to be
   compared with Mozart in the department of music and Blaise Pascal in
   letters. And again, several of the great artists are remarkable
   examples of an extraordinary combination of talents. Lionardo da Vinci
   and Michelangelo excelled alike as architects, sculptors, painters and
   poets. Lionardo was, besides being these, a chemist, engineer,
   musician, merchant and profound thinker, yea, "the precocious
   originator of all modern wonders and ideas, a subtle and universal
   genius, an isolated and insatiate investigator," and is not unjustly
   called, on his monument at Milan, "the restorer of the arts and
   sciences." [1027] His mural picture of the Last Supper in Milan, best
   known by the engraving of Raphael Morghen, in spite of its defaced
   condition, is a marvellous reproduction of one of the sublimest events,
   adapted to the monks seated around their refectory table (instead of
   the reclining posture on couches), and every head a study. As for
   Michelangelo, he has been classed by Taine with Dante, Shakespeare and
   Beethoven among the four great intellects in the world of art and
   literature.

   Distinguishing in the years between 1300-1550 two periods, the earlier
   Renaissance to 1470 and the high Renaissance, from that date forward,
   we find that Italian art had its first centre in Florence, and its most
   glorious exhibition under Julius II. and Leo X. in Rome. [1028] The
   earlier period began with Cimabue, who died about 1302, and Giotto,
   1276-1336, the friend of Dante. According to the story, Cimabue found
   Giotto, then ten years old, drawing sheep on a stone with a piece of
   charcoal and, with his father's consent, took the lad to Florence.
   These two artists employed their genius in the decoration of the
   cathedral erected to the memory of St. Francis in Assisi. The visitor
   to S. Croce and other sacred places in Florence looks upon the frescos
   of Giotto. His Dante, like Guido Reni's Beatrice Cenci, once seen can
   never be forgotten. Symonds has remarked that it may be said, without
   exaggeration, that Giotto and his scholars, within the space of little
   more than half a century, painted upon the walls of the churches and
   the public places of Italy every great conception of the Middle Ages.
   [1029] Fra Angelico da Fiesole, 1387-1455, is the most religious of the
   painters of this period, and his portraiture of saints and angels is so
   pure as to suggest no other impression than saintliness.

   The mind is almost stunned by the combination of brilliant artistic
   achievement, of which the pontificate of Julius II. may be taken as the
   centre. There flourished in that age Perugino, 1446-1524,--Raphael's
   teacher,--Lionardo da Vinci, 1452-1519, Raphael, 1483-1520,
   Michelangelo, 1475-1564, Correggio, 1493-1534, Andrea del Sarto,
   1487-1531, and Titian, 1477-1576, all Italians.

   Of Raphael, his German biographer has said his career is comprised in
   four words, "he lived, he loved, he worked, he died young." [1030] He
   was an attractive and amiable character, free from envy and jealousy,
   modest, magnanimous, patient of criticism, as anxious to learn as to
   teach, always ready to assist poor artists. Michelangelo and he labored
   in close proximity in the Vatican, Michelangelo in the Sistine chapel,
   Raphael in the stanze and loggie. Their pupils quarrelled among
   themselves, each depreciating the rival of his master; but the masters
   rose above the jealousy of small minds. They form a noble pair, like
   Schiller and Goethe among poets. Raphael seemed almost to have
   descended from a higher world. Vasari says that he combined so many
   rare gifts that he might be called a mortal god rather than a simple
   man. The portraits, which present him as an infant, youth and man, are
   as characteristic and impressive as Giotto's Dante and Guido Reni's
   Beatrice Cenci.

   Like Goethe, Raphael was singularly favored by fortune and was free
   from the ordinary trials of artists--poverty, humiliation and neglect.
   He held the appointment of papal chamberlain and had the choice between
   a cardinal's hat and marriage to a niece of Cardinal Bibbiena, with a
   dowry of three thousand gold crowns. But he put off the marriage from
   year to year, and preferred the dangerous freedom of single life. His
   contemporary and admirer, Vasari, says, when Raphael felt death
   approaching, he "as a good Christian dismissed his mistress from his
   house, making a decent provision for her support, and then made his
   last confession."

   The painter's best works are devoted to religious characters and
   events. On a visit to Florence after the burning of Savonarola, he
   learned from his friend Fra Bartolomeo to esteem the moral reformer and
   gave him, as well as Dante, a place among the great teachers of the
   Church in his fresco of the Theologia in the Vatican. His Madonnas
   represent the perfection of human loveliness and purity. In the Madonna
   di San Sisto at Dresden, so called because Sixtus IV. is introduced
   into the picture, the eye is divided between the sad yet half-jubilant
   face of the Virgin Mother, the contemplative gaze of the cherubs and
   the pensive and sympathetic expression of the divine child.

   Grimm says, Raphael's Madonnas are not Italian faces but women who are
   lifted above national characteristics. The Madonnas of da Vinci,
   Correggio, Titian, Murillo and Rubens contain the features of the
   nationality to which these painters belonged. Raphael alone has been
   able to give us feminine beauty which belongs to the European type as
   such. [1031]

   The last, the greatest, and the purest of Raphael's works is the
   Transfiguration in the Vatican. While engaged on it, he died, on Good
   Friday, his birthday. It was suspended over his coffin and carried to
   the church of the Pantheon, where his remains repose in his chosen spot
   near those of his betrothed bride, Maria di Bibbiena. In that picture
   we behold the divinest figure that ever appeared on earth, soaring high
   in the air, in garments of transparent light, and with arms outspread,
   adored by Moses on the right hand and by Elijah on the left, who
   represent the Old Covenant of law and promise. The three favorite
   disciples are lying on the ground, unable to face the dazzling splendor
   from heaven. Beneath this celestial scene we see, in striking contrast,
   the epileptic boy with rolling eyes, distorted features, and spasmodic
   limbs, held by his agonized father and supported by his sister; while
   the mother imploringly appeals to the nine disciples who, in their
   helplessness, twitted by scribes, point up to the mountain where Jesus
   had gone. In connecting the two scenes, the painter followed the
   narrative of the Gospels, Matt. xvii. 1-14; Mark ix. 2-14; Luke ix.
   28-37. The connection is being continually repeated in Christian
   experience. Descending from the Mount of Transfiguration, we are
   confronted with the misery of earth and, helpless in human strength, we
   look to heaven as the only source of help.


   Earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot heal.

   Michelangelo Buonarroti was 10 years older than Raphael, and survived
   him 44 years. He drew the inspiration for his sculptures and pictures
   from the Old Testament, from Dante and from Savonarola. He praised
   Dante in two sublime sonnets and heard Savonarola's thrilling sermons
   against wickedness and vice, and witnessed his martyrdom. Vasari and
   Condivi both bear witness to his spotless morality. He deplored the
   corruptions of the papal court.


   For Rome still slays and sells Christ at the court,

   Where paths are closed to virtue's fair increase. [1032]

   The artist's works have colossal proportions, and refuse to be judged
   by ordinary rules. They are divided between painting, as the frescos in
   the Sistine chapel of St. Peter's, architecture as in St. Peter's dome,
   and works of statuary, as Moses in Rome and David in Florence. His
   Pietà in St. Peter's, a marble group representing the Virgin Mary
   holding the crucified Saviour in her arms, raised him suddenly to the
   rank of the first sculptor of Italy. [1033] His Last Judgment, on the
   altar wall of the Sistine chapel, represents the dominant conception of
   the Middle Ages of Christ as an angry judge, and is as Dantesque as
   Dante's Inferno itself. [1034] The artist's last work in marble was the
   unfinished Pietà, in the cathedral of Florence; his last design a
   picture of the crucifixion. In his last poems, he took farewell of the
   fleeting pleasures of life, turned to God as the only reality and found
   in the crucified Saviour his only comfort. This is the core of the
   evangelical doctrine of justification rightly understood.

   The day of Michelangelo's death was the day of Galileo Galilei's birth
   in Florence. The golden age of art had passed: the age of science was
   at hand.

   Among the greater churches of Italy,--the cathedrals of Milan, Venice,
   Pisa, Siena, Florence and Rome,--St. Peter's stands pre-eminent in
   dimensions, treasures of art and imposing ecclesiastical associations.
   [1035] This central cathedral of Christendom was not dedicated till
   1626 by Urban VIII. Its reconstruction was planned on a colossal scale
   by Nicolas V., but little was done till Julius II. took up the work.
   Among the architects who gave to the building their thought, Bramante
   and Michelangelo did most. On April 18, 1506, Julius II. laid the first
   stone according to Bramante's design. A mass being said by Cardinal
   Soderini, the old pope descended by a ladder into the trench which had
   been dug at the spot where the statue of St. Veronica now stands. There
   was much fear, says Paris de Grassis, that the ground would fall in and
   the pope, before consecrating the foundations, cried out to those above
   not to come too near the edge. Under Leo X., Raphael was appointed sole
   architect, and was about to deviate from Bramante's plan, when death
   stayed his hand. Michelangelo, taking up the task in 1535, gave to the
   structure its crowning triumph in the dome, the noblest in Western
   Europe, and the rival of the dome of St. Sophia.


   That vast and wondrous dome,

   To which Diana's marvel was a cell, --

   Christ's mighty shrine above his martyr's tomb. [1036]

   § 67. The Revival of Paganism.

   The revival of letters and the cultivation of art brought no
   purification of morals to Italy nor relief from religious formalism.
   The great modern historians of the period,--Voigt, Burckhardt,
   Gregorovius, Pastor, Creighton and Symonds,--agree in depicting the
   decline of religion and the degeneracy of morals in dark colors,
   although Pastor endeavors to rescue the Church from the charge of total
   neglect of its duty and to clear the mediaeval hierarchy and theology
   from the charge of being responsible for the semi-paganism of the
   Renaissance.

   The mediaeval theology had put the priesthood in the place of the
   individual conscience. Far from possessing any passion to rescue Italy
   from a religious formalism which involved the seeds of stagnation of
   thought and moral disintegration, the priesthood was corrupt at heart
   and corrupt in practice in the highest seats of Christendom. [1037]
   Finding the clerical mind of Italy insincere and the moral condition of
   the Church corrupt, Humanism not only made no serious effort to amend
   this deplorable state but, on the contrary, it contributed to the
   further decadence of morals by a revival of paganism, now Epicurean,
   now Stoical, attested both in the lives and the writings of many of its
   chief leaders. Gregorovius has felt justified in pronouncing the
   terrible sentence that the sole end of the Italian Renaissance was
   paganism. [1038]

   The worship of classical forms led to the adoption of classical ideas.
   There were not wanting Humanists and artists who combined culture with
   Christian faith, and devoted their genius to the cause of truth and
   virtue. Traversari strictly observed the rules of his monastic order;
   Manetti, Lionardo Bruni, Vittorino da Feltre, Ficino, Sadoleto, Fra
   Angelico, Fra Bartolomeo, Michelangelo and others were devout Christian
   believers. Traversari at first hesitated to translate classic authors
   and, when he did, justified himself on the ground that the more the
   Pagan writers were understood, the more would the excellence of the
   Christian system be made manifest. But Poggio, Filelfo, Valla and the
   majority of the other writers of the Renaissance period, such as
   Ariosto, Aretino, Machiavelli, were indifferent to religion, or
   despised it in the form they saw it manifested. Culture was substituted
   for Christianity, the worship of art and eloquence for reverence for
   truth and holiness. The Humanists sacrificed in secret and openly to
   the gods of Greece and Rome rather than to the God of the Bible. Yet,
   they were not independent enough to run the risk of an open rupture
   with orthodoxy, which would have subjected them to the Inquisition and
   death at the stake. [1039] Yea, those who were most flagrant in their
   attacks upon the ecclesiastics of their time often professed repentance
   for their writings in their last days, as Boccaccio and Bandello, and
   applied for extreme unction before death. So it was with Machiavelli,
   who died with the consolations of the Church which he undermined with
   his pen, with the half-Pagan Pomponius Laetus of Rome and the infamous
   Sigismondo Malatesta of Rimini, who joined to his patronage of culture
   the commission of every crime.

   Dangerous as it may be to pronounce a final judgment upon the moral
   purity of a generation, even though, as in the case of the 15th
   century, it reveals itself clearly in its literature and in the lives
   of the upper classes, literary men, popes and princes, nevertheless
   this it is forced upon us to do. The Renaissance in Italy produced no
   Thomas à Kempis. No devout mystics show signs of a reform movement in
   her convents and among her clergy, though, it is true, there were
   earnest preachers who cried out for moral reform, as voices crying in
   the wilderness. Nor are we unmindful of the ethical disintegration of
   the Church and society at other periods and in other countries, as in
   France under Louis XIV., when we call attention to the failure of
   religion in the country of the popes and at a time of great literary
   and artistic activity to bear fruits in righteousness of life.

   The Humanists were the natural enemies of the monks. For this they
   cannot be blamed. As a class, the monks hated learning, boasted of
   superior piety, made a display of their proud humility and yet were
   constantly quarrelling with each other. Boccaccio and the novelists
   would not have selected monks and nuns as heroes and heroines of their
   obscene tales if monastic life had not been in a degenerate state.
   Poggio, Filelfo, Valla, Bandello, Machiavelli, Ariosto, Aretino and
   Erasmus and the writers of the Epistolae virorum obscurorum chastised
   with caustic irony and satire the hypocrisy and vices of the monastic
   class, or turned its members into a butt of ridicule. To the charges of
   unchastity and general hypocrisy was added the imposition of false
   miracles upon the ignorant and credulous. It was common rumor that the
   nuns were the property of the monks. [1040] The literature of the 15th
   century teems with such charges, and Savonarola was never more intense
   than when he attacked the clergy for their faithlessness and sins.
   Machiavelli openly declared "we Italians are of all most irreligious
   and corrupt," and he adds, "we are so because the representatives of
   the Church have shown us the worst example." Pastor has suggested that
   Humanists, who were themselves leading corrupt lives, were ill-fitted
   to sit in judgment upon the priesthood. This in a sense is true, and
   their representations, taken alone, would do no more than create an
   unfavorable presumption, but their statements are confirmed by the
   scandals of the papal court and the social conditions in Rome; and Rome
   was not worse than Venice, Florence and other Italian towns. The same
   distinguished historian seeks to parry the attacks of Humanistic
   writers and to offset the lives of the hierarchy by a long list of 89
   saints of the calendar who lived 1400-1520. [1041] The number is
   imposing, but outside of Bernardino da Siena, Fra Angelico, Jacopo
   della Marca and John of Capistrano, few of the names are known to
   general history, and the last two showed traits which the common
   judgment of mankind is not inclined to regard as saintly. Pastor also
   adduces the wills of the dying, in which provision was made for
   ecclesiastical objects, but these may indicate superstitious fear as
   well as intelligent piety. After all is said, it remains true that the
   responsibility and the guilt were with the clergy, who were rightly
   made the targets of the wits, satirists and philosophers of the time.

   But while the Humanists were condemning the clerical class, many, yea,
   the most of them, lived in flagrant violation of the moral code
   themselves and inclined to scepticism or outright paganism. In their
   veneration of antiquity, they made the system of Plato of equal
   authority with the Christian system, or placed its authority above the
   Christian scheme. They advocated a return to the dictates of nature,
   which meant the impulses of the natural and sensuous man. The
   watchword, sequere naturam, "follow nature," was launched as a
   philosophical principle. The hard-fought controversy which raged over
   the relative merits of the two Greek thinkers, Aristotle and Plato, was
   opened by Plethon, who accused Aristotle of atheism. The battle was
   continued for many years, calling forth from contestants the bitterest
   personal assaults. In defending Plato, Ficino set the philosopher so
   high as to obscure the superior claims of the Christian religion, and
   it was seriously proposed to combine with the Scripture readings of the
   liturgy excerpts from Plato's writings. [1042]

   The immortality of the soul was formally questioned by Pietro
   Pomponazzi, a popular teacher of the Aristotelian philosophy in Padua
   and Bologna. His tract, published in 1516, was burnt by the Franciscans
   at Venice, but was saved from a like fate in Rome and Florence by the
   intervention of Bembo and Julius de' Medici. So widespread was the
   philosophy of materialism that the Fifth Lateran three years before,
   Dec. 19, 1513, deemed it necessary to reaffirm the doctrine of the
   soul's immortality and to instruct professors at the universities to
   answer the arguments of the materialists. In the age of Julius II. and
   Leo X., scepticism reigned universally in Rome, and the priests laughed
   among themselves over their religious functions as the augurs once did
   in the ancient city. [1043]

   The chief indictment against Humanism is, that it lacked a serious
   moral sense, which is an essential element of the Christian system. Nor
   did it at any time show a purpose of morally redeeming itself or seek
   after a regenerative code of ethics. It declined into an intellectual
   and aesthetic luxury, a habit of self-indulgence for the few, with no
   provision for the betterment of society at large and apparently no
   concern for such betterment. The Humanists were addicted to arrogance,
   vanity, and lacked principle and manly dignity. They were full of envy
   and jealousy, engaged in disgraceful personal quarrels among themselves
   and stooped to sycophancy in the presence of the rich and powerful.
   Politian, Filelfo and Valla agreed in begging for presents and places
   in terms of abject flattery. While they poured contempt upon the
   functionaries of religion, they failed to imitate the self-denying
   virtues which monasticism enjoined and that regard for the rights of
   others which Christian teaching commands. Under the influence of the
   Renaissance was developed that delusive principle, called honor, which
   has played such an extensive rôle in parts of Europe and under which a
   polished culture may conceal the most refined selfishness. [1044]

   No pugilistic encounter could be more brutal than the literary feuds
   between distinguished men of letters. Poggio and Filelfo fought with
   poisoned daggers. To sully these pages, says Symonds, "with Poggio's
   rank abuse would be impossible." Poggio, not content with thrusts at
   Filelfo's literary abilities, accused him of the worst vices, and
   poured out calumnies on Filelfo's wife and mother. In Poggio's contest
   with George of Trebizond, the two athletes boxed each other's ears and
   tore one another's hair. George had accused Poggio of taking credit for
   translations of Xenophon and Diodorus which did not belong to him.
   Between Valla and Fazio eight books of invectives were exchanged.
   Bezold is forced to say that such feuds revealed perhaps more than the
   cynicism of the Italian poetry the complete moral decay. [1045]

   To the close of the period, the Renaissance literature abounds in
   offences against morality and decency. Poggio was already 70 years of
   age when he published his filthy Facetiae, Jest-book, which appeared 26
   times in print before 1500 and in 3 Italian translations. Of Poggio's
   works, Burckhardt says, "They contain dirt enough to create a prejudice
   against the whole class of Humanists." Filelfo's epigrams, De jocis et
   seriis, are declared by his biographer, Rosmini, to contain "horrible
   obscenities and expressions from the streets and the brothels."
   Beccadelli and Aretino openly preached the emancipation of the flesh,
   and were not ashamed to embellish and glorify licentiousness in
   brilliant verses, for which they received the homage of princes and
   prelates. Beccadelli's Hermaphroditus was furiously attacked by the
   monks in the pulpit, but applauded by the Humanists. Cosimo allowed the
   indecent work to be dedicated to himself, and the author was crowned by
   the Emperor Sigismund in Siena, 1433, and died old and popular at
   Naples, 1471. The critics of his obscenities, Beccadelli pointed to the
   ancient writers. Nicolas was loaned a copy of his notorious production,
   kept it for nine days and then returned the work without condemning it.
   Pietro Aretino, d. 1557, the most obscene of the Italian poets, was
   called il divino Aretino, honored by Charles V., Francis I. and Clement
   VII., and even dared to aspire to a cardinal's hat, but found a
   miserable end. Bandello, d. 1562, in his Facetiae, paints society in
   dissolution. Moral badness taints every one's lips. Debauchery in
   convents is depicted as though it were a common occurrence. And he was
   a bishop! [1046]

   Machiavelli, the Florentine politician and historian, a worshipper of
   ability and power, and admirer of Caesar Borgia, built upon the basis
   of the Renaissance a political system of absolute egotism; yet he
   demands of the prince that he shall guard the appearance of five
   virtues to deceive the ignorant. [1047] Under the cover of Stoicism,
   many Humanists indulged in a refined Epicureanism.

   The writers of novels and plays not only portrayed social and domestic
   immorality without a blush, but purposely depicted it in a dress that
   would call forth merriment and laughter. Tragedy was never reached by
   the Renaissance writers. The kernel of this group of works was the
   faithlessness of married women, for the unmarried were kept under such
   close supervision that they were with difficulty reached. The skill is
   enlarged upon with which the paramour works out his plans and the
   outwitted husband is turned into an object of ridicule. Here we are
   introduced to courtesans and taken to brothels. [1048]

   In the Mandragola by Machiavelli, Callimaco, who has been in Paris,
   returns to Florence determined to make Lucrezia, of whose charms he has
   heard, his mistress. Assuming the roll of a physician, he persuades her
   husband, who is anxious for an heir, to allow him to use a potion of
   mandragora, which will relieve his wife of sterility and at the same
   time kill the paramour. Working upon the husband's mind through the
   mother-in-law and Lucrezia's confessor, who consents to the plot for a
   bribe, he secures his end. Vice and adultery are glorified. And this
   was one of the plays on which Leo X. looked with pleasure! In 1513, in
   face of the age-long prohibition of the theatre by the Church, this
   pontiff opened the playhouse on the Capitol. A few years later he
   witnessed the performance of Ariosto's comedy the Suppositi. The
   scenery had been painted by Raphael. The spectators numbered 2,000, Leo
   looking on from a box with an eye-glass in his hand. The plot centres
   around a girl's seduction by her father's servant. One of the first of
   the cardinals to open his palace to theatrical representations was
   Raffaele Riario.

   Intellectual freedom in Italy assumed the form of unrestrained
   indulgence of the sensual nature. In condemning the virginity extolled
   by the Church, Beccadelli pronounced it a sin against nature. Nature is
   good, and he urged men to break down the law by mixing with nuns.
   [1049] The hetaerae were of greater service to mankind than monastic
   recluses. Illegitimacy, as has already been said, was no bar to high
   position in the state or the Church. Aeneas Sylvius declared that most
   of the rulers in Italy had been born out of wedlock, [1050] and when,
   as pope, he arrived in Ferrara, 1459, he was met by eight princes, not
   a single one of them the child of legitimate marriage. The appearance
   of the Gallic disease in Italy at the close of the 15th century may
   have made men cautious; the rumor went that Julius II., who did not
   cross his legs at public service on a certain festival, was one of its
   victims. [1051] Aretino wrote that the times were so debauched that
   cousins and kinsfolk of both sexes, brothers and sisters, mingled
   together without number and without a shadow of conscientious scruple.
   [1052]

   What else could be expected than the poisoning of all grades of society
   when, at the central court of Christendom, the fountain was so corrupt.
   The revels in the Vatican under Alexander VI. and the levity of the
   court of Leo X. furnished a spectacle which the most virtuous
   principles could scarcely be expected to resist. Did not a harlequin
   monk on one occasion furnish the mirth at Leo's table by his
   extraordinary voracity in swallowing a pigeon whole, and consuming
   forty eggs and twenty capons in succession! Innocent VIII.'s son was
   married to a daughter of the house of the Medici, and Alexander's son
   was married into the royal family of France and his daughter Lucrezia
   into the scarcely less proud family of Este. Sixtus IV. taxed and
   thereby legalized houses of prostitution for the increase of the
   revenues of the curia. The 6,800 public prostitutes in Rome in 1490, if
   we accept Infessura's figures, were an enormous number in proportion to
   the population. This Roman diarist says that scarcely a priest was to
   be found in Rome who did not keep a concubine "for the glory of God and
   the Christian religion." All parts of Italy and Spain contributed to
   the number of courtesans. They lived in greater splendor in Rome than
   the hetaerae in Athens, and bore classical names, such as Diana,
   Lucrezia, Camilla, Giulia, Costanza, Imperia, Beatrice. They were
   accompanied on their promenades and walks to church by poets, counts
   and prelates, but usually concluded their gilded misery in hospitals
   after their beauty had faded away. [1053]

   The almost nameless vice of the ancient world also found its way into
   Italy, and Humanists and sons of popes like the son of Paul III.,
   Pierluigi Farnese, if not popes themselves, were charged with
   pederasty. In his 7th satire, Ariosto, d. 1533, went so far as to say
   it was the vice of almost all the Humanists. For being addicted to it,
   a Venetian ambassador lost his position, and the charge was brought
   against the Venetian annalist, Sanuto. Politian, Valla and Aretino and
   the academicians of Rome had the same accusation laid at their door.
   The worst cannot be told, so abhorrent to the prime instincts of
   humanity do the crimes against morality seem. No wonder that Symonds
   speaks of "an enervation of Italian society in worse than heathen
   vices." [1054]

   To licentiousness were added luxury, gaming, the vendetta or the law of
   blood-revenge, and murder paid for by third parties. Life was cheap
   where revenge, a licentious end or the gain of power was a motive.
   Cardinals added benefice to benefice in order to secure the means of
   gratifying their luxurious tastes. [1055] In the middle of the 16th
   century, Italy, says Burckhardt, was in a moral crisis, out of which
   the best men saw no escape. In the opinion of Symonds, who has written
   seven volumes on the Renaissance, it is "almost impossible to
   overestimate the moral corruption of Rome at the beginning of the 16th
   century. And Gregorovius adds that "the richest intellectual life
   blossomed in a swamp of vices." [1056]

   Of open heresy and attacks upon the papal prerogatives, popes were
   intolerant enough, as was quickly proved, when Luther appeared and
   Savonarola preached, but not of open immorality and secret infidelity.
   In the hierarchical interest they maintained the laws of sacerdotal
   celibacy, but allowed them to be broken by prelates in their confidence
   and employ, and openly flaunted their own bastard children and
   concubines. And unfortunately, as has been said, not only did the
   Humanists, with some exceptions, fall in with the prevailing
   licentiousness: there even was nothing in their principles to prevent
   its practice. As a class, the artists were no better than the scholars
   and, if possible, even more lax in regard to sexual license. Such
   statements are made not in the spirit of bitterness toward the Church
   of the Middle Ages, but in deference to historic fact, which ought at
   once to furnish food for reflection upon the liability of an
   ecclesiastical organization to err and even to foster vice as well as
   superstition by its prelatical constitution and unscriptural canons,
   and also to afford a warning against the captivating but fallacious
   theory that literature and art, not permeated by the principles of the
   Christian faith, have the power to redeem themselves or purify society.
   They did not do it in the palmy days of Greece and Rome, nor did they
   accomplish any such end in Italy.

   In comparing our present century with the period of the Renaissance,
   there is at least one ground for grateful acknowledgment. [1057] The
   belief in astrology, due largely to the rise of astronomical science,
   has been renounced. Thomas Aquinas had decided that astrology was a
   legitimate art when it is used to forecast natural events, such as
   drought and rain, but when used to predict human actions and destiny it
   is a daemonic cult. [1058] At an early period it came to be classed
   with heresy, and was made amenable to the Inquisition. In 1324, Cecco
   d'Ascoli, who had shown that the position of libra rendered the
   crucifixion of Christ inevitable, was obliged to abjure, and his
   astrolabe and other instruments were burnt, 1327, by the tribunal at
   Florence. In spite of Petrarca's ridicule, the cult continued. The
   Chancellor D'Ailly gave it credit. Scarcely a pope or Italian prince or
   republic of the latter part of the Renaissance period who did not have
   his astrologer or yield to the delusion in a larger or smaller measure,
   as, for example, Sixtus IV., Julius II. and Leo X., as well as Paul
   III. at a period a little later. Julius II. delayed his coronation
   several weeks, to Nov. 26, 1503, the lucky day announced by the
   astrologer. Ludovico of Milan waited upon favorable signs in the
   heavens before taking an important step. [1059]

   On the other hand, Savonarola condemned the belief, and was followed by
   Pico della Mirandola and Erasmus. [1060] To the freedom of human action
   astrology opposed a fatalistic view of the world. This was felt at the
   time, and Matteo Villani said more than once that "no constellation is
   able to compel the free-will of man or thwart God's decree." Before the
   15th century had come to a close, the cult was condemned to extinction
   in France, 1494, but in Germany, in spite of the spread of the
   Copernican system, it continued to have its followers for more than a
   century. The great Catholic leader in the Thirty Years' War,
   Wallenstein, continued, in the face of reverses, to follow the supposed
   indications of the heavenly bodies, and Schiller puts into his mouth
   the words:


   The stars he not; what's happened

   Has turned out against the course of star and fate;

   Art does not play us false. The false heart

   'Tis, which drags falsehood into the truth-telling heavens.

   The revolt against the ascendancy of mediaeval priestcraft and
   scholastic dialectic was a great and necessary movement demanded by the
   sane intents of mankind. The Italian Renaissance led the revolt. It
   gave liberty to the individual and so far its work was wholesome, but
   it was liberty not bound by proper restraints. It ran wild in an excess
   of indulgence, so that Machiavelli could say, "Italy is the corruption
   of the world." When the restraint came, it came from the North as it
   had come centuries before, in the days of the Ottos, in the 10th
   century. When studies in Italy set aside the ideals of Christianity,
   when religion seemed to be in danger of expiring and social virtue of
   altogether giving way, then the voice was raised in Wittenberg which
   broke with monastic asceticism and scholasticism and, at the same time,
   asserted an individualism under the control of conscience and reverence
   for God.

   § 68. Humanism in Germany.

   Humanistic studies were late in finding entrance into Germany. They
   were opposed not so much by priestly ignorance and prejudice, as was
   the case in Italy, as by the scholastic theology which reigned at the
   universities. German Humanism may be dated from the invention of the
   printing-press about 1450. Its flourishing period began at the close of
   the 15th century and lasted only till about 1520, when it was absorbed
   by the more popular and powerful religious movement, the Reformation,
   as Italian Humanism was superseded by the papal counter-Reformation.
   Marked features distinguished the new culture north of the Alps from
   the culture of the Italians. The university and school played a much
   more important part than in the South. The representatives of the new
   scholarship were teachers, even Erasmus, who taught in Cambridge, and
   was on intimate terms with the professors at Basel. During the progress
   of the movement new universities sprang up, from Basel to Rostock.
   Again, in Germany, there were no princely patrons of arts and learning
   to be compared in intelligence and munificence to the Renaissance popes
   and the Medici. Nor was the new culture here exclusive and
   aristocratic. It sought the general spread of intelligence, and was
   active in the development of primary and grammar schools. In fact, when
   the currents of the Italian Renaissance began to set toward the North,
   a strong, independent, intellectual current was pushing down from the
   flourishing schools conducted by the Brothers of the Common Life. In
   the Humanistic movement, the German people was far from being a slavish
   imitator. It received an impulse from the South, but made its own path.
   Had Italy been careful to take lessons from the pedagogy of the North,
   it is probable her people would to-day be advanced far beyond what they
   are in intelligence and letters.

   In the North, Humanism entered into the service of religious progress.
   German scholars were less brilliant and elegant, but more serious in
   their purpose and more exact in their scholarship than their Italian
   predecessors and contemporaries. In the South, the ancient classics
   absorbed the attention of the literati. It was not so in the North.
   There was no consuming passion to render the classics into German as
   there had been in Italy. Nor did Italian literature, with its loose
   moral teachings, find imitators in the North. Boccaccio's Decameron was
   first translated into German by the physician, Henry Stainhöwel, who
   died in 1482. North of the Alps, the attention was chiefly centred on
   the Old and New Testaments. Greek and Hebrew were studied, not with the
   purpose of ministering to a cult of antiquity, but to more perfectly
   reach the fountains of the Christian system. In this way, preparation
   was made for the constructive work of the Protestant Reformation.

   And what was true of the scholarship of Germany was also true of its
   art. The painters, Albrecht Dürer, who was born and died at Nürnberg,
   1471-1528, Lukas Kranach, 1472-1553, and for the most part Hans
   Holbein, 1497-1543, were free from the pagan element and contributed to
   the spread of the Reformation. Kranach lived in Wittenberg after 1504
   and painted portraits of Luther, Melanchthon and other leaders of the
   German Reformation. Holbein gave illustrations for some of the new
   writings and painted portraits of Erasmus and Melanchthon. His Madonna,
   now at Darmstadt, has a German face and wears a crown on her head,
   while the child in her arms reflects his concern for the world in the
   sadness of his countenance.

   If any one individual more than another may be designated as the
   connecting link between the learning of Italy and Germany, it is Aeneas
   Sylvius. By his residence at the court of Frederick III. and at Basel,
   as one of the secretaries of the council, he became a well-known
   character north of the Alps long before he was chosen pope. The
   mediation, however, was not effected by any single individual. The fame
   of the Renaissance was carried over the pathways of trade which led
   from Northern Italy to Augsburg, Nürnberg, Constance and other German
   cities. The visits of Frederick III. and the campaigns of Charles VIII.
   and the ascent of the throne of Naples by the princes of Aragon carried
   Germans, Frenchmen and Spaniards to the greater centres of the
   peninsula. A constant stream of pilgrims itinerated to Rome and the
   Spanish popes drew to the city throngs of Spaniards. As the fame of
   Italian culture spread, scholars and artists began to travel to Venice,
   Florence and Rome, and caught the inspiration of the new era.

   To the Italians Germany was a land of barbarians. They despised the
   German people for their ignorance, rudeness and intemperance in eating
   and drinking. Aeneas found that the German princes and nobles cared
   more for horses and dogs than for poets and scholars and loved their
   wine-cellars better than the muses. Campanus, a witty poet of the papal
   court, who was sent as legate to the Diet of Regensburg by Paul II.,
   and afterwards was made a bishop by Pius II., abused Germany for its
   dirt, cold climate, poverty, sour wine and miserable fare. He lamented
   his unfortunate nose, which had to smell everything, and praised his
   ears, which understood nothing. Such impressions were soon offset by
   the sound scholarship which arose in Germany and Holland. And, if Italy
   contributed to Germany an intellectual impulse, Germany sent out to the
   world the printing-press, the most important agent in the history of
   intellectual culture since the invention of the alphabet.

   Before the first swell of the new movement was felt, the older German
   universities were already established: Prag in 1347, Vienna 1365,
   Heidelberg 1386, Cologne 1388, Erfurt 1392, Würzburg 1402, Leipzig 1409
   and Rostock 1419. During the last half of the 15th century, there were
   quickly added to this list universities at Greifswald and Freiburg
   1456, Treves 1457, Basel 1459, Ingolstadt 1472, Tübingen and Mainz
   1477, and Wittenberg 1502. Ingolstadt lost its distinct existence by
   incorporation in the University of Munich, 1826, and Wittenberg by
   removal to Halle. Most of these universities had the four faculties,
   although the popes were slow to give their assent to the sanction of
   the theological department, as in the case of Vienna and Rostock, where
   the charter of the secular prince authorized their establishment.
   Strong as the religious influences of the age were, the social and
   moral habits of the students were by no means such as to call for
   praise. Parents, Luther said, in sending their sons to the
   universities, were sending them to destruction, and an act of the
   Leipzig university, dating from the close of the 15th century, stated
   that students came forth from their homes obedient and pious, but "how
   they returned, God alone knew." [1061] In 1510, the student-body at
   Erfurt were so turbulent that the citizens and the peasant-folk turned
   cannons upon the collegiate building and, after the students had fled,
   battered down its walls and did great damage to university archives and
   library.

   The theological teaching was ruled by the Schoolmen, and the dialectic
   method prevailed in all departments. In clashing with the scholastic
   method and curricula, the new teaching met with many a repulse, and in
   no case was it thoroughly triumphant till the era of the Reformation
   opened. Erfurt may be regarded as having been the first to give the new
   culture a welcome. In 1466, it received Peter Luder of Kislau, who had
   visited Greece and Asia Minor, and had been previously appointed to a
   chair in Heidelberg, 1456. He read on Virgil, Jerome, Ovid and other
   Latin writers. There Agricola studied and there Greek was taught by
   Nicolas Marschalck, under whose supervision the first Greek book
   printed in Germany issued from the press, 1501. There John of Wesel
   taught. It was Luther's alma mater and, among his professors, he
   singled out Trutvetter for special mention as the one who directed him
   to the study of the Scriptures. [1062]

   Heidelberg, chartered by the elector Ruprecht I. and Pope Urban VI.,
   showed scant sympathy with the new movement. However, the
   elector-palatine, Philip, 1476-1508, gathered at his court some of its
   representatives, among them Reuchlin. Ingolstadt for a time had
   Reuchlin as professor and, in 1492, Konrad Celtis was appointed
   professor of poetry and eloquence.

   In 1474, a chair of poetry was established at Basel. Founded by Pius
   II., it had among its early teachers two Italians, Finariensis and
   Publicius. Sebastian Brant taught there at the close of the century and
   among its notable students were Reuchlin and the Reformers, Leo Jud and
   Zwingli. In 1481, Tübingen had a stipend of oratoria. Here Gabriel Biel
   taught till very near the close of the century. The year after Biel's
   death, Heinrich Bebel was called to lecture on poetry. One of Bebel's
   distinguished pupils was Philip Melanchthon, who studied and taught in
   the university, 1512-1518. Reuchlin was called from Ingolstadt to
   Tübingen, 1521, to teach Hebrew and Greek, but died a few months later.

   Leipzig and Cologne remained inaccessible strongholds of scholasticism,
   till Luther appeared, when Leipzig changed front. The last German
   university of the Middle Ages, Wittenberg, founded by Frederick the
   Wise and placed under the patronage of the Virgin Mary and St.
   Augustine, acquired a world-wide influence through its professors,
   Luther and Melanchthon. Not till 1518, did it have instruction in
   Greek, when Melanchthon, soon to be the chief Greek scholar in Germany,
   was called to one of its chairs at the age of 21. According to Luther,
   his lecture-room was at once filled brimful, theologians high and low
   resorting to it.

   As seats of the new culture, Nürnberg and Strassburg occupied, perhaps,
   even a more prominent place than any of the university towns. These two
   cities, with Basel and Augsburg, had the most prosperous German
   printing establishments. At the close of the 15th century, Nürnberg,
   the fountain of inventions, had four Latin schools and was the home of
   Albrecht Dürer the painter and Willibald Pirkheimer, a patron of
   learning.

   Popular education, during the century before the Reformation, was far
   more advanced in Germany than in other nations. The chief schools,
   conducted by the Brothers of the Common Life, were located at Zwolle,
   Deventer, Herzogenbusch and Liége. All the leading towns had schools.
   [1063] The attendance at Deventer ran as high as 2,200. Melanchthon
   attended the Latin school at Pforzheim, now in Baden. Here Reuchlin
   found his young grand-nephew and gave him a Greek grammar, promising
   him a Vocabulary, provided Melanchthon would have ready some verses in
   Latin on his return. It is needless to say that the boy was ready and
   received the book. The town of Schlettstadt in Alsace was noted as a
   classical centre. Here Platter found Sapidus teaching, and he regarded
   it as the best school he had found. In 1494, there were five pedagogues
   in Wesel, teaching reading, writing, arithmetic and singing. One
   Christmas the clergy of the place entertained the pupils, giving them
   each cloth for a new coat and a piece of money. [1064] The primary or
   trivial schools, as they were called from teaching the
   trivium,--grammar, rhetoric and dialectic,--gradually extended their
   courses and, before the Reformation, such schools as Liége and
   Schlettstadt had eight classes. [1065] Greek was begun with the 4th
   class.

   Among the noted schoolmasters was Alexander Hegius, who taught at
   Deventer for nearly a quarter of a century, till his death in 1498. At
   the age of 40 he was not ashamed to sit at the feet of Agricola. He
   made the classics central in education and banished the old text-books.
   Trebonius, who taught Luther at Eisenach, belonged to a class of worthy
   men. The penitential books of the day called upon parents to be
   diligent in keeping their children off the streets and sending them to
   school. [1066] It remained for Luther to issue a stirring appeal to the
   magistrates of the Saxon towns to establish schools for both girls and
   boys and he called for a curriculum, which included not only history
   and Latin but vocal and instrumental music.

   The chief Humanists of Germany were Rudolph Agricola, Reuchlin and
   Erasmus. To the last two a separate treatment is given as the
   pathfinders of biblical learning, the venerabiles inceptores of modern
   biblical research.

   Agricola, whose original name was Roelef Huisman, was born near
   Groningen, 1443, and died 1485. He enjoyed the highest reputation in
   his day as a scholar and received unstinted praise from Erasmus and
   Melanchthon. He has been regarded as doing for Humanism in Germany what
   was done for Italy by Petrarca, the first life of whom, in German,
   Agricola prepared. He was far in advance of the Italian poet in the
   purity of his life. After studying in Erfurt, Louvain and Cologne,
   Agricola went to Italy, spending some time at the universities in Pavia
   and Ferrara. He declined a professor's chair in favor of an appointment
   at the court of Philip of the Palatinate in Heidelberg. He made Cicero
   and Quintilian his models. In his last years, he turned his attention
   to theology and studied Hebrew. Like Pico della Mirandola, he was
   buried in the cowl of a monastic order. The inscription on his tomb in
   Heidelberg stated that he had studied what is taught about God and the
   true faith of the Saviour in the books of Scripture.

   Another Humanist was Jacob Wimpheling, 1450-1528, of Schlettstadt, who
   taught in Heidelberg. He was inclined to be severe on clerical abuses
   but, at the close of his career, wanted to substitute for the study of
   Virgil and Horace, Sedulius and Prudentius. The poetic Sebastian Brant,
   1457-1521, the author of the Ship of Fools, began his career as a
   teacher of law in Basel. Mutianus Rufus, d. at Gotha 1526, in his
   correspondence, went so far as to declare that Christianity is as old
   as the world and that Jupiter, Apollo, Ceres and Christ are only
   different names of the one hidden God. [1067]

   A name which deserves a high place in the German literature of the last
   years of the Middle Ages is John Trithemius, 1462-1505, abbot of a
   Benedictine convent at Sponheim, which, under his guidance, gained the
   reputation of a learned academy. He gathered a library of 2,000 volumes
   and wrote a patrology, or encyclopaedia of the Fathers, and a catalogue
   of the renowned men of Germany. Prelates and nobles visited him to
   consult and read the Latin and Greek authors he had collected. These
   men and others contributed their part to that movement of which
   Reuchlin and Erasmus were the chief lights and which led on easily to
   the Protestant Reformation. [1068]

   Luther speaks of the number of floggings he got a day. No case is more
   famous than that of Hans Butzbach. As a little fellow he was accustomed
   to play truant. When the teacher, an Erfurt B. A., found it out, he
   took off the child's clothes and, binding him to a post, flogged him
   till the blood covered his body. His mother, hearing the cries, hurried
   to the school, and bursting the door open and seeing her child, fell
   fainting to the floor. Schmid, II. 125.

   § 69. Reuchlin and Erasmus.

   In his fresco of the Reformation on the walls of the Berlin museum,
   Kaulbach has given a place of great prominence to Reuchlin and Erasmus.
   They are represented in the group of the Humanists, standing side by
   side, with books under their arms and clad in scholar's cap and gown,
   their faces not turned toward the central figure on the platform,
   Martin Luther. The artist has presented the truth of history. These two
   most noteworthy German scholars prepared the way for the Reformation
   and the modern study of the Greek and Hebrew Scriptures, but remained
   and died in the Roman Church in which they were born. Rightly did
   Ulrich von Hutten call them "the two eyes of Germany." To them, and
   more especially to Erasmus, did all the greater Reformers owe a debt,
   Luther, Calvin, Zwingli, Oecolampadius, Melanchthon and Beza.

   John Reuchlin, 1455-1522, known also by the Latin name Capnion, [1069]
   was born in Pforzheim and studied at Schlettstadt, Freiburg, Paris,
   Basel, Orleans, Poictiers, Florence and Rome. He learned Greek from
   native Greeks, Hebrew from John Wessel and from Jewish rabbis in
   Germany and Italy. He bought many Hebrew and rabbinical books, and
   marked down the time and place of purchase to remind him of the
   happiness their first acquaintance gave him. A lawyer by profession, he
   practised law in Stuttgart and always called himself legum doctor. He
   was first in the service of Eberhard, count of Würtemberg, whom he
   accompanied to Italy in 1482 as he later accompanied his son, 1490. He
   served on diplomatic missions and received from the Emperor Maximilian
   the rank of a count of the Palatinate. At Eberhard's death he removed
   to Heidelberg, 1496, where he was appointed by the elector Philip chief
   tutor in his family. His third visit to Rome, 1498, was made in the
   elector's interest. Again he returned to Stuttgart, from which he was
   called in 1520 to Ingolstadt as professor of Greek and Hebrew at a
   salary of 200 gulden. In 1521, he was driven from the city by the
   plague and was appointed lecturer in Tübingen. His death occurred the
   following spring at Liebenzell in the Black Forest.

   Reuchlin recommended Melanchthon as professor of Greek in the
   University of Wittenberg, and thus unconsciously secured him for the
   Reformation. He was at home in almost all the branches of the learning
   of his age, but especially in Greek and Hebrew. He translated from
   Greek writings into Latin, and a part of the Iliad and two orations of
   Demosthenes into German. His first important work appeared at Basel
   when he was 20, the Vocabularius breviloquus, a Latin lexicon which
   went through 25 editions, 1475-1504. He also prepared a Greek Grammar.
   His chief distinction, however, is as the pioneer of Hebrew learning
   among Christians in Northern Europe. He gave a scientific basis for the
   study of this language in his Hebrew Grammar and Dictionary, the De
   rudimentis hebraicis, which he published in 1506 at his own cost at
   Pforzheim. Its circulation was slow and, in 1510, 750 copies of the
   edition of 1,000 still remained unsold. The second edition appeared in
   1537. The author proudly concluded this work with the words of Horace,
   that he had reared a monument more enduring than brass. [1070] In 1512,
   he issued the Penitential Psalms with a close Latin translation and
   grammatical notes, a work used by Luther. The printing of Hebrew books
   had begun in Italy in 1475.

   Reuchlin pronounced Hebrew the oldest of the tongues--the one in which
   God and angels communicated with man. In spite of its antiquity it is
   the richest of the languages and from it other languages drew, as from
   a primal fountain. He complained of the neglect of the study of the
   Scriptures for the polite study of eloquence and poetry. [1071]
   Reuchlin studied also the philosophy of the Greeks and the Neo-Platonic
   and Pythagorean mysticisms. He was profoundly convinced of the value of
   the Jewish Cabbala, which he found to be a well of hidden wisdom. In
   this rare branch of learning he acknowledged his debt to Pico della
   Mirandola, whom he called "the greatest scholar of the age." He
   published the results of his studies in two works--one, De verbo
   mirifico, which appeared at Basel in 1494, and passed through eight
   editions; and one, De arte cabbalistica, 1517. "The wonder-working word
   "is the Hebrew tetragrammaton Ihvh, the unpronounceable name of God,
   which is worshipped by the celestials, feared by the infernals and
   kissed by the soul of the universe. The word Jesu, Ihsvh, is only an
   enlargement of Ihvh by the letter s. The Jehovah- and Jesus-name is the
   connecting link between God and man, the infinite and the finite. Thus
   the mystic tradition of the Jews is a confirmation of the Christian
   doctrine of the trinity and the divinity of Christ. Reuchlin saw in
   every name, in every letter, in every number of the old Testament, a
   profound meaning. In the three letters of the word for create, bara,
   Gen. 1:1, he discerned the mystery of the Trinity; in one verse of
   Exodus, 72 inexpressible names of God; in Prov. 30:31, a prophecy that
   Frederick the Wise, of Saxony, would follow Maximilian as emperor of
   Germany, a prophecy which was not fulfilled. We may smile at these
   fantastic vagaries; but they stimulated and deepened the zeal for the
   hidden wisdom of the Orient, which Reuchlin called forth from the
   grave.

   Through his interest in the Jews and in rabbinical literature, Reuchlin
   became involved in a controversy which spread over all Europe and
   called forth decrees from Cologne and other universities, the
   archbishop of Mainz, the inquisitor-general of Germany, Hoogstraten,
   the emperor, Maximilian, and Pope Leo X. The monks were his chief
   opponents, led by John Pfefferkorn, a baptized Jew of Cologne. The
   controversy was provoked by a tract on the misery of the Jews, written
   by Reuchlin, 1505--Missive warumb die Juden so lang im Elend sind. Here
   the author made the obstinacy of the Jews in crucifying Christ and
   their persistence in daily blaspheming him the just cause of their
   sorrows, but, instead of calling for their persecution, he urged a
   serious effort for their conversion. In a series of tracts, Pfefferkorn
   assaulted this position and demanded that his former coreligionists, as
   the sworn enemies of Christ, should be compelled to listen to Christian
   preaching, be forbidden to practise usury and that their false Jewish
   books should be destroyed. [1072] The flaming anti-Semite prosecuted
   his case with the vigor with which a few years later Eck prosecuted the
   papal case against Luther. Maximilian, whose court he visited three
   times to present the matter, Hoogstraten and the University of Cologne
   took Pfefferkorn's side, and the emperor gave him permission to burn
   all Jewish books except, of course, the Old Testament. Called upon to
   explain his position by the archbishop of Mainz, with whom Maximilian
   left the case, Reuchlin exempted from destruction the Talmud, the
   Cabbala and all other writings of the Jews except the Nizahon and the
   Toledoth Jeshu, which, after due examination and legal decision, might
   be destroyed, as they contained blasphemies against Christ, his mother
   and the Apostles. He advised the emperor to order every university in
   Germany to establish chairs of Hebrew for ten years. [1073]

   Pfefferkorn, whom Reuchlin had called a "buffalo or an ass," replied in
   a violent attack, the Handmirror--Handspiegel wider und gegen die Juden
   -- 1511. Both parties appeared before the emperor, and Reuchlin replied
   in the Spectacles--Augenspiegel,--which in its turn was answered by his
   antagonist in the Burning Glass--Brandspiegel. The sale of the
   Spectacles was forbidden in Frankfurt. Reuchlin followed in a Defense
   against all Calumniators, 1513, and after the manner of the age
   cudgelled them with such epithets as goats, biting dogs, raving wolves,
   foxes, hogs, sows, horses, asses and children of the devil. [1074] An
   appeal he made to Frederick the Wise called forth words of support from
   Carlstadt and Luther. The future Reformer spoke of Reuchlin as a most
   innocent and learned man, and condemned the inquisitorial zeal of the
   Cologne theologians who "might have found worse occasions of offence on
   all the streets of Jerusalem than in the extraneous Jewish question."
   The theological faculty of Cologne, which consisted mostly of
   Dominicans, denounced 43 sentences taken from Reuchlin as heretical,
   1514. The Paris university followed suit. Cited before the tribunal of
   the Inquisition by Hoogstraten, Reuchlin appealed to the pope.
   Hoogstraten had the satisfaction of seeing the Augenspiegel publicly
   burnt at Cologne, Feb. 10, 1514. The young bishop of Spires, whom Leo
   X. appointed to adjudicate the case, cleared Reuchlin and condemned
   Hoogstraten to silence and the payment of the costs, amounting to 111
   gulden, April 24, 1514. [1075] But the indomitable inquisitor took
   another appeal, and Leo appointed Cardinal Grimani and then a
   commission of 24 to settle the dispute. All the members of the
   commission but Sylvester Prierias favored Reuchlin, who was now
   supported by the court of Maximilian, by the German "poets" as a body
   and by Ulrich von Hutten, but opposed by the Dominican order. When a
   favorable decision was about to be rendered, Leo interposed, June 23,
   1520, and condemned Reuchlin's book, the Spectacles, as a work friendly
   to the Jews, and obligated the author to pay the costs of trial and
   thereafter to keep silence. The monks had won and Pfefferkorn, with
   papal authority on his side, could celebrate his triumph over
   scholarship and toleration in a special tract, 1521.

   With the Reformation, which in the meantime had broken out at
   Wittenberg, the great Hebrew scholar showed no sympathy. He even turned
   away from Melanchthon and cancelled the bequest of his library, which
   he had made in his favor, and gave it to his native town, Pforzheim. He
   prevented, however, Dr. Eck, during his brief sojourn at Ingolstadt,
   from burning Luther's writings. His controversy with Pfefferkorn had
   shown how strong in Germany the spirit of obscurantism was, but it had
   also called forth a large number of pamphlets and letters in favor of
   Reuchlin. The Hebrew pathfinder prepared a collection of such
   testimonies from Erasmus, Mutianus, Peutinger, Pirkheimer, Busch,
   Vadianus, Glareanus, Melanchthon, Æcolampadius, Hedio and others,--in
   all, 43 eminent scholars who were classed as Reuchlinists.

   Among the writings of the Reuchlinists against the opponents of the new
   learning, the Letters of Unfamed Men--Epistolae virorum obscurorum --
   occupy the most prominent place. These epistles are a fictitious
   correspondence of Dominican monks who expose their own old-fogyism,
   ignorance and vulgarity to public ridicule in their barbarous
   German-Latin jargon, which is called kitchen-Latin, Küchenlatein, and
   which admits of no adequate translation. They appeared anonymously, but
   were chiefly written by Ulrich von Hutten and Crotus Rubeanus whose
   German name was Johannes Jaeger. The authors were friends of Luther,
   but Crotus afterwards fell out with the Reformation, like Erasmus and
   other Humanists.

   Ulrich von Hutten, 1488-1523, after breaking away from the convent in
   which his father had placed him six years before, pursued desultory
   studies in the University of Cologne, developed a taste for the
   Humanistic culture and travelled in Italy. In 1517, he returned to
   Germany and had a position at the court of the pleasure-loving
   Albrecht, archbishop of Mainz, a patron of the new learning. He was
   crowned with the poet's crown by Maximilian and was hailed as the
   future great epic poet of Germany by Erasmus, but later incurred the
   hostility of that scholar who, after Hutten's death, directed against
   his memory the shafts of his satire. He joined Franz von Sickingen in
   standing ready to protect Luther at Worms. Placed under the ban, he
   spent most of his time after 1520, till his death, in semi-concealment
   at Schlettstadt, Basel and at Zürich under the protection of Zwingli.

   Hutten's life at Cologne and in Rome gave him opportunity enough to
   find out the obscurantism of the Dominicans and other foes of progress
   as well as the conditions prevailing at the papal court. In 1517, he
   edited Valla's tract on the spurious Donation of Constantine and, with
   inimitable irony, dedicated it to Leo X. In ridicule and contempt it
   excelled everything, Janssen says, that had been written in Germany up
   to that time against the papacy. As early as 1513, Hutten issued
   epigrams from Italy, calling Julius II. "the corrupter of the earth,
   the plague of mankind." [1076] His Latin poem, the Triumph of Reuchlin,
   1518, defended the Hebrew scholar, and called for fierce punishment
   upon Pfefferkorn. It contained a curious woodcut, representing
   Reuchlin's triumphal procession to his native Pforzheim, and his
   victory over Hoogstraten and Pfefferkorn with their four idols of
   superstition, barbarism, ignorance and envy. [1077]

   The 10 Epistles of the Unfamed Men, written first in Latin and then
   translated by Hutten into German, with genial and not seldom coarse
   humor, demanded the restriction of the pope's tyranny, the dissolution
   of the convents, the appropriation of annates and lands of abolished
   convents and benefices for the creation of a fund for the needy. The
   amorous propensities of the monks are not spared. The author called the
   holy coat of Treves a lousy old rag, and declared the relics of the
   three kings of Cologne to be the bodies of three Westphalian peasants.
   In the 4th letter, entitled the Roman trinity, things are set forth and
   commented upon which were found in three's in Rome. Three things were
   considered ridiculous at Rome: the example of the ancients, the papacy
   of Peter and the last judgment. There were three things of which they
   had a superabundance in the holy city: antiquities, poison and ruins;
   three articles were kept on sale: Christ, ecclesiastical places and
   women; three things which gave the Romelings pain: the unity among the
   princes, the growing intelligence of the people and the revelation of
   their frauds; three things which they disliked most to hear about: a
   general council, a reformation of the clerical office and the opening
   of the eyes of the Germans; three things held as most precious:
   beautiful women, proud horses and papal bulls. These were some of the
   spectacles which Rome offered. Had not Hutten himself been in Rome,
   when the same archbishop's pall was sold twice in a single day! The
   so-called "gracious expectations," which the pope distributed, were a
   special mark of his favor to the Germans. [1078] Hutten's wit reached
   the popular heart, drew laughter from the educated and stirred up the
   wrath of the self-satisfied advocates of the old ways. As a knight, he
   touched a new chord, the national German pride, a chord on which Luther
   played as a master.

   What Reuchlin did for Hebrew learning, Erasmus, who was twelve years
   his junior, accomplished for Greek learning and more. He established
   the Greek pronunciation which goes by his name; he edited and
   translated Greek classics and Church Fathers and made them familiar to
   northern scholars, and he furnished the key to the critical study of
   the Greek Testament, the magna charta of Christianity. He was the
   contemporary of the Protestant Reformers and was an invaluable aid to
   the movement led by them through his edition of the New Testament, his
   renunciation of scholastic subtlety in its interpretation and his
   attacks on the ceremonial religiosity of his age. But, when the time
   came for him to take open sides, he protested his aversion to the
   course which the Reformers had taken as a course of violence and
   revolution. He died in isolation, without a party. The Catholics would
   not claim him; the Protestants could not. [1079]

   Desiderius Erasmus, 1466-1536, was born at Rotterdam out of wedlock,
   his father probably a priest at the time. [1080] His school life began
   at Deventer when he was nine years old, Hegius then being in charge.
   His parents died when he was 13 and, in 1481, he was in the school at
   Herzogenbusch where he spent three years, a period he speaks of as lost
   time. His letters of after years refer to his school experiences
   without enthusiasm or gratitude. After wandering about, he was
   persuaded against his will to enter a convent at Steyn. This step, in
   later years, he pronounced the most unfortunate calamity of his life.
   To his experience in the convent he ascribed the physical infirmity of
   his manhood. But he certainly went forth with the great advantage of
   having become acquainted with conventual life on its inside, and
   wholesome moral influence must have been exerted from some quarter in
   his early life to account for the moral discrimination of his later
   years. His ability secured for him the patronage of the bishop of
   Cambray, who intended taking him as his interpreter to Italy, where he
   hoped to receive the cardinal's hat. So far as Italy went, the young
   scholar was disappointed, but the bishop sent him to Paris, without,
   however, providing him with much financial assistance. He was able to
   support himself from the proceeds of instruction he gave several young
   Englishmen and, through their mediation, Erasmus made his first visit
   to England, 1499. This visit seems to have lasted only two or three
   months. [1081]

   At Oxford, the young scholar met Colet and Sir Thomas More and, through
   the influence of the former, was induced to give more attention to the
   Greek than he had been giving. The next years he spent in France and
   Holland writing his book of Proverbs,--Adagia,--issued 1500, and his
   Manual of the Christian soldier, --Enchiridion militis
   Christiani,--issued in 1502. In 1505, he was back in England, remaining
   there for three years. He then embraced an opportunity to travel in
   Italy with the two sons of Henry VII.'s Genoese physician, Battista
   Boerio. At Turin, he received the doctor's degree, spent a number of
   months in Venice, turning out work for the Aldine presses, and visited
   Bologna, Rome and other cities. There is no indication in his
   correspondence that he was moved by the culture, art or natural scenery
   of Italy, nor does he make a single reference to the scenery of the
   Alps which he crossed.

   Expecting lucrative appointment from Henry VIII., Erasmus returned to
   England, 1509, remaining there five years. On his way, he wrote for
   diversion his Praise of Folly,--Encomium moriae,--a book which received
   its title from the fact that he was thinking of Sir Thomas More when
   its conception took form in his mind. The book was completed in More's
   house and was illustrated with life-like pictures by Holbein. [1082]
   During part of this sojourn in England, Erasmus was entered as "Lady
   Margaret's Professor of Divinity" at Cambridge and taught Greek. The
   salary was 65 dollars a year, which Emerton calls "a respectable sum."
   He was on intimate terms with Colet, now dean of St. Paul's, More,
   Fisher, bishop of Rochester, Archbishop Warham and other Englishmen.
   Lord Mountjoy provided him with an annuity and Archbishop Warham with
   the living of Aldington in 1411, which Erasmus retained for a while and
   then exchanged for an annuity of £20 from the archbishop. [1083]

   From 1515-1521, he had his residence in different cities in the
   Lowlands, and it was at this time he secured complete dispensation from
   the monastic vow which had been granted in part by Julius II. some
   years earlier. [1084] Erasmus' fame now exceeded the fame of any other
   scholar in Europe. Wherever he went, he was received with great honors.
   Princes joined scholars and prelates in doing him homage. Melanchthon
   addressed to him a poem, "Erasmus the best and greatest," Erasmum
   optimum, maximum. His edition of the Greek New Testament appeared in
   1516, and in 1518 his Colloquies, a collection of familiar relations of
   his experiences with men and things.

   When persecution broke out in the Netherlands after Leo's issuance of
   his bull against Luther, Erasmus removed to Basel, where some of his
   works had already been printed on the Froben presses. At first be found
   the atmosphere of his new home congenial, and published one edition
   after the other of the Fathers,--Hilary 1523, Irenaeus 1526, Ambrose
   1527, Augustine 1528, Epiphanius 1529, Chrysostom 1530. But when the
   city, under the influence of Oecolampadius, went Protestant and Erasmus
   was more closely pushed to take definite sides or was prodded with
   faithlessness to himself in not going with the Reformers, he withdrew
   to the Catholic town of Freiburg in Breisgau, 1529. The circulation of
   his Colloquies had been forbidden in France and burnt in Spain, and his
   writings were charged by the Sorbonne with containing 82 heretical
   teachings. On the other hand, he was offered the red hat by Paul III.,
   1535, but declined it on account of his age.

   After the death of Oecolampadius, he returned to Basel, 1535, broken
   down with the stone and catarrh. The last work on which he was engaged
   was an edition of Origen. He died calling out, "Oh, Jesus Christ, thou
   Son of God, have mercy on me," but without priest or extreme
   unction,--sine lux, sine crux, sine Deus, as the Dominicans of Cologne
   in their joy and bad Latin expressed it. He was buried in the
   Protestant cathedral of Basel, carried to the grave, as his friend and
   admirer, Beatus Rhenanus, informs us, on the shoulders of students. The
   chief magistrate of the city and all the professors and students were
   present at the burial.

   Erasmus was the prince of Humanists and the most influential and useful
   scholar of his age. He ruled with undisputed sway as monarch in the
   realm of letters. He combined brilliant genius with classical and
   biblical learning, keen wit and elegant taste. He rarely wrote a dull
   line. His extensive travels made him a man of the world, a genuine
   cosmopolitan, and he stood in correspondence with scholars of all
   countries who consulted him as an oracle. His books had the popularity
   and circulation of modern novels. When the rumor went abroad that his
   Colloquies were to be condemned by the Sorbonne, a Paris publisher
   hurried through the press an edition of 24,000 copies. To the income
   from his writings and an annuity of 400 gulden which he received as
   counsellor of Charles V.--a title given him in 1516--were added the
   constant gifts from patrons and admirers. [1085]

   Had Erasmus confined himself to scholarly labors, though he secured
   eminence as the first classicist of his age, his influence might have
   been restricted to his time and his name to a place with the names of
   Politian of Italy and Budaeus of France, whose works are no longer
   read. But it was otherwise. His labors had a far-reaching bearing on
   the future. He was a leading factor in the emancipation of the mind of
   Europe from the bondage of ignorance and superstition, and he uncovered
   a lifeless formalism in religion. He unthawed the frost-bitten
   intellectual soil of Germany. The spirit of historical criticism which
   Laurentius Valla had shown in the South, he represented north of the
   Alps, and of Valla he spoke as "unrivalled both in the sharpness of his
   intelligence and the tenacity of his memory." [1086] But the sweep of
   his influence is due to the mediation of his pupils and admirers,
   Zwingli, Oecolampadius and Luther.

   Erasmus' break with the old mediaeval ecclesiasticism was shown in a
   fourfold way. He scourged the monks for their ignorance, pride and
   unchastity, and condemned that ceremonialism in religion which is
   without heart; he practised the critical method in the treatment of
   Scripture; he issued the first Greek New Testament; be advocated the
   translation of the Bible into the languages spoken in his day.

   In almost every work that he wrote, Erasmus, in a vein of satire or in
   serious statement, inveighed against the hypocritical pretension of the
   monkery of his time and against the uselessness of hollow religious
   rites. In his edition of the New Testament, he frequently returns to
   these subjects. For example, in a note on Matt. 19:12 he speaks of the
   priests "who are permitted to fornicate and may freely keep concubines
   but not have a wife." [1087] Nowhere is his satire more keen on the
   clergy than in the Praise of Folly. In this most readable book, Folly
   represented as a female, delivers an oration to an audience of all
   classes and conditions and is most explicit and elaborate when she
   discourses on the priests, monks, theologians and the pope. After
   declaring with consummate irony that of all classes the theologians
   were the least dependent upon her, Folly proceeds to exhibit them as
   able to give the most exquisite solutions for the most perplexing
   questions, how in the wafer accidents may subsist without a subject,
   how long a time it required for the Saviour to be conceived in the
   Virgin's womb, whether God might as easily have become a woman, a
   devil, a beast, an herb or a stone as a man. In view of such wonderful
   metaphysics, the Apostles themselves would have needed a new
   illuminating spirit could they have lived again.

   As for the monks, whose name signifies solitude, they were to be found
   in every street and alley. They were most precise about their girdles
   and hoods and the cut of their crowns, yet they easily provoked
   quarrels, and at last they would have to search for a new heaven, for
   entrance would be barred them to the old heaven prepared for such as
   are true of heart. As for the pope, Luther's language never pictured
   more distinctly the world-wide gulf between what the successor of St.
   Peter should be and really was, than did the biting sentences of
   Erasmus. Most liberal, he said, were the popes with the weapons of the
   Spirit,--interdicts, greater and lesser excommunications, roaring bulls
   and the like,--which they launch forth with unrestrained vehemence when
   the authority of St. Peter's chair is attacked. These are they who by
   their lusts and wickedness grieve the Holy Spirit and make their
   Saviour's wounds to bleed afresh. [1088] In the Enchiridion, he says,
   "Apostle, pastor and bishop" are names of duties not of government, and
   papa, pope, and abbas, abbot, are titles of love. The sale of
   indulgences, saint worship and other mediaeval abuses came in for
   Erasmus' poignant thrusts.

   In addition to his own Annotations and Paraphrases of the New
   Testament, he edited the first printed edition of Valla's Annotations,
   which appeared in Paris, 1505. It was his great merit to call attention
   to the plain meaning of Scripture and to urge men "to venerate the
   living and breathing picture of Christ in the sacred books, instead of
   falling down before statues of wood and stone of him, adorned though
   they were with gold. What were Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas and
   Ockam compared with him, whom the Father in heaven called His beloved
   Son!" As for the Schoolmen, he said, "I would rather be a pious divine
   with Jerome than invincible with Scotus. Was ever a heretic converted
   by their subtleties!" [1089]

   The appearance of Erasmus' edition of the Greek Testament at Basel,
   1516, marked an epoch in the study and understanding of the Scriptures.
   It was worth more for the cause of religion than all the other literary
   works of Erasmus put together, yea, than all the translations and
   original writings of all the Renaissance writers. The work contained a
   dedication to Leo X., a man whom Erasmus continued to flatter, as in
   the epistle dedicating to him his edition of Jerome, but who of all men
   was destined to oppose the proclamation of the true Gospel. The volume,
   672 pages in all, contained the Greek text in one column and Erasmus'
   own Latin version in the other, together with his annotations. It was
   hurried through the press in order to anticipate the publication of the
   New Testament of the Complutensian Polyglot, which was actually printed
   in 1514, but was not given to the public till 1520. The editor used
   three manuscripts of the 12th century, which are still preserved in the
   university library of Basel and retain the marginal notes of Erasmus
   and the red lines of the printer to indicate the corresponding pages of
   the printed edition. Erasmus did not even take the trouble to copy the
   manuscripts, but sent them, with numerous marginal corrections, to the
   printer. [1090] The manuscript of the Apocalypse was borrowed from
   Reuchlin, and disappeared, but was rediscovered, in 1861, by Dr.
   Delitzsch in the library of Oettingen-Wallerstein at Mayhingen,
   Bavaria. It was defective on the last leaf and supplemented by Erasmus,
   who translated the last six verses from the Vulgate into indifferent
   Greek, for he was a better Latinist than Hellenist.

   In all, Erasmus published five editions of the Greek Testament-1516,
   1519, 1522, 1527 and 1535. Besides, more than 30 unauthorized reprints
   appeared in Venice, Strassburg, Basel, Paris and other cities. He made
   several improvements, but his entire apparatus never exceeded eight
   MSS. The 4th and the 5th editions were the basis of the textus
   receptus, which ruled supreme till the time of Lachmann and Tregelles.
   His notes and paraphrases on the New Testament, the Apocalypse
   excepted, were translated into English, and a copy given to every
   parish in 1547. Zwingli copied the Pauline Epistles from the 1st Greek
   edition with his own hand in the convent at Einsiedeln, 1516. From the
   2d edition of 1519, Luther prepared his German translation on the
   Wartburg, 1522, and Tyndale his English version, 1526.

   Thus Erasmus directly contributed to the preparation of the vernacular
   versions which he so highly commended in his Preface to the 1st edition
   of his Greek Testament. He there expressed the hope that the Scriptures
   might be translated into every tongue and put into the hands of every
   reader, to give strength and comfort to the husbandman at his plough,
   to the weaver at his shuttle, to the traveller on his journey and to
   the woman at her distaff. He declared it a miserable thing that
   thousands of educated Christians had never read the New Testament. In
   editing the Greek original, it was his purpose, so he says, to enable
   the theologians to study Christianity at its fountain-head. It was high
   praise when Oecolampadius confessed he had learned from Erasmus that
   "in the Sacred Books nothing was to besought but Christ," nihil in
   sacris scripturis praeter Christum quaerendum. [1091]

   It was a common saying, to which Erasmus himself refers, that he laid
   the egg which Luther hatched. His relations to the Wittenberg Reformer
   and to the movement of the Reformation is presented in the 6th volume
   of this series. Here it is enough to say that Erasmus desired a
   reformation by gradual education and gentle persuasion within the
   limits of the old Church system. He disapproved of the violent measures
   of Luther and Zwingli, and feared that they would do much harm to the
   cause of learning and refined culture, which he had more at heart than
   religion.

   He and Luther never met, and he emphatically disavowed all
   responsibility for Luther's course and declared he had had no time to
   read Luther's books. And yet, in a letter to Zwingli, he confessed that
   most of the positions taken by Luther he had himself taken before
   Luther's appearance. The truth is that Erasmus was a critical scholar
   and not a man of action or of deep fervor of conviction. At best, he
   was a moralist. He went through no such religious experiences as
   Luther, and Luther early wrote to Lange that he feared Erasmus knew
   little of the grace of God. The early part of the 16th century was a
   period when the critic needed to be supplemented. Erasmus had no mind
   for the fray of battle. His piety was not deep enough to brave a
   rupture with the old order. He courted the flattery of the pope, though
   his pen poured forth ridicule against him. And nowhere is the
   difference of the two men shown in clearer light than in their
   treatment of Leo X., whom, when it was to his advantage, Erasmus lauded
   as a paragon of culture. [1092] He did not see that something more was
   needed than literature and satire to work a change. The times required
   the readiness for martyrdom, and Erasmus' religious conviction was not
   sufficient to make him ready to suffer for principle. On most
   controverted points, Emerton well says he had one opinion for his
   friends and another for the world. He lacked both the candor and the
   courage to be a religious hero. "Erasmus is a man for himself" was the
   apt characterization often repeated in the Letters of Unfamed Men.
   Luther spoke to the German people and fought for them. Erasmus awakened
   the admiration of the polite by his scholarship and wit. The people
   knew him not. Luther spoke in German: Erasmus boasted that he knew as
   little Italian as Indian and that he was little conversant with German,
   French or English. He prided himself on his pure Latinity.

   Erasmus never intended to separate from Rome any more than his English
   friends, John Colet and Thomas More. He declared he had never departed
   from the judgment of the Church, nor could he. "Her consent is so
   important to me that I would agree with the Arians and Pelagians if the
   Church should approve what they taught." This he wrote in 1526 after
   the open feud with Luther in the controversy over the freedom of the
   will. The Catholic Church, however, never forgave him. All his works
   were placed on the Index by two popes, Paul IV. in 1559 and Sixtus V.,
   1590, as intentionally heretical. In 1564, by the final action of the
   Council of Trent, this sweeping judgment was revoked and all the
   writings removed from the Index except the Colloquies, Praise of Folly,
   Christian Marriage and one or two others, a decision confirmed by
   Clement VIII., 1596. And there the matter has rested since. [1093]

   The Catholic historian of the German people, Janssen, in a dark picture
   of Erasmus, presents him as vain and conceited, ungrateful to his
   benefactors, always ready to take a neutral attitude on disputed
   questions and, for the sake of presents, flattering to the great.
   Janssen calls attention to his delight over the gold and silver vessels
   and other valuables he had received in gifts. My drawers, Erasmus
   wrote, "are filled with presents, cups, bottles, spoons, watches, some
   of them of pure gold, and rings too numerous to count." In only one
   respect, says Janssen, did he go beyond his Italian predecessors in his
   attack upon the Church. The Italians sneered and ridiculed, but kept
   their statements free from hypocritical piety, which Erasmus often
   resorted to after be had driven his dagger into his opponent's breast.
   [1094] In England, the old Puritan, Tyndale, also gave Erasmus no
   quarter, but spoke of him as one "whose tongue maketh little gnats
   great elephants and lifteth up above the stars whosoever giveth him a
   little exhibition." [1095] But no one has ever understood Erasmus and
   discerned what was his mission better than Luther. That Reformer, who
   had once called him "our ornament and hope--decus nostrum et
   spes,"--expressed the whole truth when, in a letter to Oecolampadius,
   1523, he said: "Erasmus has done what he was ordained to do. He has
   introduced the ancient languages in place of the pernicious scholastic
   studies. He will probably die like Moses in the land of Moab .... He
   has done enough to overcome the evil, but to lead to the land of
   promise is not, in my judgment, his business."

   § 70. Humanism in France.

   Humanism in France found its way from Italy, but did not become a
   distinct movement until the 16th century was well on its way. Budaeus,
   1467-1540, was the chief representative of classical studies; Faber
   Stapulensis, or, to use his French name, Lefèvre d'Etaples, of
   Christian culture, 1469-1536, both of them living well into the period
   of the Reformation. [1096] In France, as in Germany, the pursuit of the
   classics never went to the point of intoxication as it did in Italy. In
   France, the Renaissance did not reach its maturity till after the
   Reformation was well advanced in Germany, the time at which the springs
   of the movement in the Italian peninsula were dried up.

   On the completion of the 100 years' war between France and England, the
   intellectual currents began to start. In 1464, Peter Raoul composed for
   the duke of Bourgogne a history of Troy. At that time the French still
   regarded themselves as descendants of Hector. If we except Paris, none
   of the French universities took part in the movement. Individual
   writers and printing-presses at Paris, Lyons, Rouen and other cities
   became its centres and sources. William Fichet and Gaguin are usually
   looked upon as the first French Humanists. Fichet introduced "the
   eloquence of Rome" at Paris and set up a press at the Sorbonne. He
   corresponded with Bessarion and had in his library volumes of Petrarca,
   Guarino of Verona and other Italians. Gaguin copied and corrected
   Suetonius in 1468 and other Latin authors. Poggio's Jest-book and some
   of Valla's writings were translated into French. In the reign of Louis
   XI., who gloried in the title "the first Christian king," French poets
   celebrated his deeds. The homage of royalty took in part the place
   among the literary men of France that the cult of antiquity occupied in
   Italy. [1097]

   Greek, which had been completely forgotten in France, had its first
   teachers in Gregory Tifernas, who reached Paris, 1458, John Lascaris,
   who returned with Charles VIII., and Hermonymus of Sparta, who had
   Reuchlin and Budaeus among his scholars. An impetus was given to the
   new studies by the Italian, Aleander, afterwards famous for his
   association with Luther at Worms. He lectured in Paris, 1509, on Plato
   and issued a Latino-Greek lexicon. In 1512 his pupil, Vatable,
   published the Greek grammar of Chrysoloras. William Budaeus, perhaps
   the foremost Greek scholar of his day, founded the Collège de France,
   1530, and finally induced Francis I. to provide for instruction in
   Hebrew and Greek. The University of Paris at the close of the 14th
   century was sunk into a low condition and Erasmus bitterly complained
   of the food, the morals and the intellectual standards of the college
   of Montague which he attended. Budaeus urged the combination of the
   study of the Scriptures with the study of the classics and exclaimed of
   the Gospel of John, "What is it, if not the almost perfect sanctuary of
   the truth!" [1098] He persisted in setting himself against the
   objection that the study of the languages of Scripture led on to
   Lutheranism.

   Lefèvre studied in Paris, Pavia, Padua and Cologne and, for longer or
   shorter periods, tarried in the greater Italian cities. He knew Greek
   and some Hebrew. From 1492-1506 he was engaged in editing the works of
   Aristotle and Raymundus Lullus and then, under the protection of
   Briçonnet, bishop of Meaux, he turned his attention to theology. It was
   his purpose to offset the Sentences of Peter the Lombard by a system of
   theology giving only what the Scriptures teach. In 1509, he published
   the Psalterum quintuplex, a combination of five Latin versions of the
   Psalms, including a revision and a commentary by his own hand. In 1512,
   he issued a revised Latin translation of the Pauline Epistles with
   commentary. In this work, he asserted the authority of the Bible and
   the doctrine of justification by faith, without appreciating, however,
   the far-reaching significance of the latter opinion. [1099] He also
   called in question the merit of good works and priestly celibacy. In
   his Preface to the Psalms Lefèvre said, "For a long time I followed
   Humanistic studies and I scarcely touched my books with things divine,
   but then these burnt upon me with such light, that profane studies
   seemed to be as darkness in comparison." Three years after the
   appearance of Luther's New Testament, Lefèvre's French translation
   appeared, 1523. It was made from the Vulgate, as was his translation of
   the Old Testament, 1528. In 1522 and 1525, appeared his commentaries on
   the four Gospels and the Catholic Epistles. The former was put on the
   Index by the Sorbonne. The opposition to the free spirit of inquiry and
   to the Reformation, which the Sorbonne stirred up and French royalty
   adopted, forced him to flee to Strassburg and then to the liberal court
   of Margaret of Angoulême.

   Among those who came into contact with Lefèvre were Farel and Calvin,
   the Reformers of Geneva. In the meantime Clement Marot, 1495-1544, the
   first true poet of the French literary revival, was composing his
   French versification of the Psalms and of Ovid's Metamorphoses. The
   Psalms were sung for pleasure by French princes and later for worship
   in Geneva and by the Huguenots. When Calvin studied the humanities and
   law at Bourges, Orleans and Paris, about 1520, he had for teachers
   Cordier and L'Etoile, the canonists, and Melchior Wolmar, teacher of
   Greek, whose names the future Reformer records with gratitude and
   respect. He gave himself passionately to Humanistic studies and sent to
   Erasmus a copy of his work on Seneca's Clemency, in which he quoted
   frequently from the ancient classics and the Fathers. Had he not
   adopted the new religious views, it is possible he would now be known
   as an eminent figure in the history of French Humanism.

   § 71. Humanism in England.

   Use well temporal things: desire eternal things.

   --John Colet.

   Humanism reached England directly from Italy, but was greatly advanced
   by Erasmus during his three sojourns at Oxford and Cambridge and by his
   close and abiding friendship with the leading English representatives
   of the movement. Its history carries us at once to the universities
   where the conflict between the new learning and the old learning was
   principally fought out and also to St. Paul's school, London, founded
   by Colet. It was marked with the usual English characteristics of
   caution and reserve, and never manifested any of the brilliant or
   paganizing traits of the Italian literary movement, nor did it reach
   the more profound classical scholarship of the German Humanists. In the
   departments of the fine arts, if we except printing, it remained
   unresponsive to the Continental leadership. English Humanism, like the
   theology of the English Reformation, adopted the work of others. It was
   not creative. On the other hand, it laid more distinctive emphasis upon
   the religious and ethical elements than the Humanistic circles of
   Italy, though not of Germany. Its chief leaders were John Colet and Sir
   Thomas More, with whom Erasmus is also to be associated. It had patrons
   in high places in Archbishop Warham of Canterbury, Cardinal Wolsey and
   John Fisher, bishop of Rochester. [1100]

   The English revival of letters was a direct precursor of the English
   Reformation, although its earliest leaders died in the Catholic Church.
   Its first distinct impetus was received in the last quarter of the 15th
   century through English students who visited Italy. It had been the
   custom for English archdeacons to go to Italy for the study of the
   canon law. Richard de Bury and Peter de Blois had shown interest in
   books and Latin profane authors. Italians, Poggio and Polidore Virgil
   [1101] among them, tarried and some of them taught in England, but the
   first to introduce the new movement were William Sellyng, Thomas
   Linacre and William Grocyn.

   Sellyng, of All Souls' College, Oxford, and afterwards prior of Christ
   Church, Canterbury, 1471-1495, made a visit to Italy in 1464 and at
   Bologna was a pupil of Politian. From this tour, or from a later one,
   he brought back with him some Greek MSS. and he introduced the studying
   of Greek in Canterbury. Linacre, d. 1524, the most celebrated medical
   man of his day in England, studied under Sellyng at Christ Church and
   then in Oxford, where he took Greek under Cornelio Vitelli, the first
   to publicly teach that language in England in the later Middle Ages. He
   then went to Florence, Rome and Padua, where he graduated in medicine.
   On returning to England, he was ordained priest and later made
   physician to Henry VIII. He translated the works of Galen into English.
   [1102]

   While Linacre was studying in Florence, Grocyn arrived in that city. He
   was teaching Greek in Oxford before 1488 and, on his return from the
   Continent, he began, 1491, to give Greek lectures in that university.
   With this date the historian, Green, regards the new period as opening.
   Grocyn lectured on pseudo-Dionysius and, following Laurentius Valla,
   abandoned the tradition that he was the Areopagite, the pupil of St.
   Paul. He and Linacre were close friends of Erasmus, and that scholar
   couples them with Colet and More as four representatives of profound
   and symmetrical learning. [1103]

   At the close of the 15th century, the English were still a "barbarous"
   people in the eyes of the Italians. [1104] According to Erasmus, who
   ought to have known what a good school was, the schoolteachers of
   England were "shabby and broken down and, in cases, hardly in their
   senses." At the universities, the study of Duns Scotus ruled and the
   old method and text-books were in use. The Schoolmen were destined,
   however, soon to be displaced and the leaves of the Subtle Doctor to be
   scattered in the quadrangles of Oxford and trodden under foot.

   As for the study of Greek, there were those, as Wood says, who preached
   against it as "dangerous and damnable" and, long after the new century
   had dawned, Sir Thomas More wrote to the authorities at Oxford
   condemning them for opposition to Greek. [1105] A course of sermons, to
   which More refers, had been preached in Lent not only against the study
   of the Greek classics but also the Latin classics. What right, he went
   on to say, "had a preacher to denounce Latin of which he knew so little
   and Greek of which he knew nothing? How can he know theology, if he is
   ignorant of Hebrew, Greek and Latin? "In closing the letter, More
   threatened the authorities with punishment from Warham, Wolsey and even
   the king himself, if they persisted in their course. Of the clergy's
   alarm against the new learning, More took notice again and again. To
   Lily, the headmaster of St. Paul's school, he wrote, "No wonder your
   school raises a storm; it is like the wooden horse for the ruin of
   barbarous Troy." But, if there were those who could see only danger
   from the new studies, there were also men like Fisher of Rochester who
   set about learning Greek when he was 60. For the venerable Sentences of
   the Lombard, the Scriptures were about to be instituted as the
   text-book of theology in the English universities.

   The man who contributed most to this result was John Colet. Although
   his name is not even so much as mentioned in the pages of Lingard, he
   is now recognized, as he was by Tyndale, Latimer and other Reformers of
   the middle of the 16th century, as the chief pioneer of the new
   learning in England and as an exemplar of noble purposes in life and
   pure devotion to culture.

   The son of Sir Henry Colet, several times lord mayor of London, the
   future dean of St. Paul's was one of 22 children. He survived all the
   members of his family except his mother, to whom he referred, when he
   felt himself growing old, with admiration for her high spirits and
   happy old age. As we think of her, we may be inclined to recall the
   good mother of John Wesley. After spending 3 years at Oxford,
   1493-1496, [1106] young Colet, "like a merchantman seeking goodly
   wares," as Erasmus put it, went to Italy. For the places where he
   studied, we are left to conjecture, but Archbishop Parker two
   generations later said that he studied "a long time in foreign
   countries and especially the Sacred Scriptures." On his return to
   Oxford, although not yet ordained to the priesthood, he began
   expounding St. Paul's Greek epistles in public, the lectures being
   given gratuitously. At this very moment the Lady Margaret professor of
   divinity was announcing for his subject the Quodlibets of Duns Scotus.
   Later, Colet expounded also the First Epistle to the Corinthians.

   At this period, he was not wholly freed from the old academic canons
   and was inclined to reject the reading of classic authors whose
   writings did not contain a "salutatory flavor of Christ and in which
   Christ is not set forth .... Books, in which Christ is not found, are
   but a table of devils." [1107] Of the impression made by his
   exposition, a proof is given in Colet's own description of a visit he
   had from a priest. The priest, sitting in front of Colet's fire, drew
   forth from his bosom a small copy of the Epistles, which he had
   transcribed with his own hand, and then, in answer to his request, his
   host proceeded to set forth the golden things of the 1st chapter of
   Romans. [1108] His expositions abound in expressions of admiration for
   Paul.

   At Oxford, in 1498, Colet met Erasmus, who was within a few months of
   being of the same age, and he also came into contact with More, whom he
   called "a rare genius." The fellowship with these men confirmed him in
   his modern leanings. He lectured on the Areopagite's Hierarchies, but
   he soon came to adopt Grocyn's view of their late date. The high
   estimate of Thomas Aquinas which prevailed, he abandoned and pronounced
   him "arrogant for attempting to define all things" and of "corrupting
   the whole teaching of Christ with his profane philosophy." [1109] Some
   years later, writing to Erasmus, he disparaged the contemporary
   theologians as spending their lives in mere logical tricks and
   dialectic quibbles. Erasmus, replying to him, pronounced the theology
   which was once venerable "become, almost dumb, poor and in rags."

   As dean of St. Paul's, an appointment he received in 1504, Colet stands
   forth as a reformer of clerical abuses, a bold preacher and a liberal
   patron of education. The statutes he issued for the cathedral clergy
   laid stress upon the need of reformation "in every respect, both in
   life and religion." The old code, while it was particular to point out
   the exact plane the dean should occupy in processions and the choir,
   did not mention preaching as one of his duties. Colet had public
   lectures delivered on Paul's Epistles, but it was not long till he was
   at odds with his chapter. The cathedral school did not meet his
   standard, and the funds he received on his father's death he used to
   endow St. Paul's school, 1509. [1110] The original buildings were burnt
   down in the London fire, and new buildings reared in 1666. The statutes
   made the tuition free, and set the number of pupils at 153, since
   increased threefold. They provided for instruction in "good literature,
   both Latin and Greek," but especially for Christian authors that "wrote
   their wisdom with clean and chaste Latin." The founder's high ideal of
   a teacher's qualifications, moral as well as literary, set forth in his
   statutes for the old cathedral school, was "that he should be an
   upright and honorable man and of much and well-attested learning."
   Along with chaste literature, he was expected "to imbue the tender
   minds of his pupils with holy morals and be to them a master, not of
   grammar only, but of virtue." [1111]

   St. Paul's has the distinction of being the first grammar-school in
   England where Greek was taught. The list of its masters was opened by
   William Lily, one of the few Englishmen of his age capable of teaching
   Greek. After studying at Oxford, he made a journey to Jerusalem, and
   returned to England by way of Italy. He died in 1522. By his will,
   Colet left all his books, "imprinted and in paper," to poor students of
   the school.

   As a preacher, the dean of St. Paul's was both bold and Scriptural.
   Among his hearers were the Lollards. Colet himself seems to have read
   Wyclif's writings as well as other heretical works. [1112] Two of his
   famous sermons were delivered before convocation, 1511, and on Wolsey's
   receiving the red hat. The convocation discourse, which has come down
   to us entire, is a vigorous appeal for clerical reform. [1113] The text
   was taken from Rom. xii:2. "Be ye not conformed to this world but be ye
   reformed." The pride and ambition of the clergy were set forth and
   their quest of preferment in Church and state condemned. Some
   frequented feasts and banquetings and gave themselves to sports and
   plays, to hunting and hawking. [1114] If priests themselves were good,
   the people in their turn would be good also. "Our goodness," exclaimed
   the preacher, "would urge them on in the right way far more
   efficaciously than all your suspensions and excommunications. They
   should live a good and holy life, be properly learned in the Scriptures
   and chiefly and above all be filled with the fear of God and the love
   of the heavenly life."

   According to the canons of the age, the preacher went beyond the limits
   of prudence and Fitz-James, bishop of London, cited him for trial but
   the case was set aside by the archbishop. The charges were that Colet
   had condemned the worship of images and declared that Peter was a poor
   man and enjoyed no episcopal revenues and that, in condemning the
   reading of sermons, Colet had meant to give a thrust to Fitz-James
   himself, who was addicted to that habit. Latimer, who was at Cambridge
   about that time, said in a sermon some years later, that, in those days
   Doctor Colet was in trouble and should have been burned, if God had not
   turned the king's heart to the contrary."

   When Erasmus' Greek Testament appeared, Colet gave it a hearty welcome.
   In a letter to the Dutch scholar acknowledging the receipt of a copy,
   he expressed his regret at not having a sufficient knowledge of Greek
   to read it and his desire to be his disciple in that tongue. It was
   here he made the prediction that "the name of Erasmus will never
   perish." Erasmus had written to Colet that he had dipped into Hebrew
   but gone no further, "frightened by the strangeness of the idiom and in
   view of the insufficiency of the human mind to master a multitude of
   subjects." [1115] A much younger scholar at Tübingen, Philip
   Melanchthon, had put his tribute to the Novum instrumentum in Greek
   verse which was transmitted to Erasmus by Beatus Rhenanus. Fox, bishop
   of Winchester, pronounced the book more instructive to him than 10
   commentaries.

   Not long before his death, Colet determined to retire to a religious
   retreat at Shene, a resolution based upon his failing health and the
   troubles in which his freedom of utterance had involved him. He did not
   live to carry out his resolution. He was buried in St. Paul's. It is
   noteworthy that his will contained no benefactions to the Church or
   provision for masses for his soul. Erasmus paid the high tribute to his
   friend, while living, that England had not "another more pious or one
   who more truly knew Christ." And, writing after Colet's death to a
   correspondent, he exclaimed, "What a man has England and what a friend
   I have lost!" Colet had often hearkened to Erasmus' appeals in times of
   stringency. [1116] No description in the Colloquies has more interest
   for the Anglo-Saxon people than the description of the journey which
   the two friends made together to the shrines of Thomas à Becket and of
   Our Lady of Walsingham. And the best part of the description is the
   doubting humor with which they passed criticism upon Peter's finger,
   the Virgin's milk, one of St. Thomas' shoes and other relics which were
   shown them.

   Far as Colet went in demanding a reform of clerical habits, welcoming
   the revival of letters, condemning the old scholastic disputation and
   advocating the study of the Scriptures, it is quite probable he would
   not have fallen in with the Reformation. [1117] He was fifty when it
   broke out. The best word that can be spoken of him is, that he seems to
   have conformed closely to the demand which he made of Christian men to
   live good and upright lives for, of a surety, he said, "to do mercy and
   justice is more pleasant to God, than to pray or do sacrifice to Him."
   [1118] What higher tribute could be paid than the one paid by Donald
   Lupton in his History of Modern Protestant Divines, 1637, "This great
   dean of St. Paul's taught and lived like St. Paul." [1119]

   Sir Thomas More, 1478-1535, not only died in the Catholic Church, but
   died a martyr's death, refusing to acknowledge the English king's
   supremacy so far as to impugn the pope's authority. After studying in
   Oxford, be practised law in London, rising to be chancellor of the
   realm. It is not for us here to follow his services in his profession
   and to the state, but to trace his connection with the revival of
   learning and the religious movement in England. More was a pattern of a
   devout and intelligent layman. He wore a hair shirt next to his skin
   and yet he laughed at the superstition of his age. On taking office, he
   stipulated that, he should first look to God and after God to the
   king." At the same time, he entered heartily with his close friends,
   Erasmus and Colet, into the construction of a new basis for education
   in the study of the classics, Latin and Greek. He was firmly bound to
   the Church, with the pope as its head, and yet in his Utopia he
   presented a picture of an ideal society in which religion was to be in
   large part a matter of the family, and confession was not made to the
   priest nor absolution given by the priest.

   With the exception of the Utopia, all of More's genuine works were
   religious and the most of them were controversial treatises, intended
   to confute the new doctrines of the Reformation which had found open
   advocates in England long before More's death. More was beheaded in
   1535 and, if we recall that Tyndale's English New Testament was
   published in 1526, we shall have a standard for measuring the duration
   of More's contact with the Protestant upheaval. Tyndale himself was
   strangled and burnt to death a year after More's execution. In answer
   to Simon Fish's work, The Supplication of Beggars, a bitter attack
   against purgatory, More sent forth the Supplication of Souls or Poor
   Seely (simple) Souls pewled out of Purgatory. Here souls are
   represented as crying out not to be left in their penal distress by the
   forgetfulness of the living. Fish was condemned to death and burnt,
   1533. As the chief controversialist on the old side, More also wrote
   against John Fryth, who was condemned to the stake 1533, and against
   Tyndale, pronouncing his translation of the New Testament "a false
   English translation newly forged by Tyndale." He also made the strange
   declaration that "Wyclif, Tyndale and Friar Barnes and such others had
   been the original cause why the Scripture has been of necessity kept
   out of lay people's hands." [1120] More said heretical books were
   imported from the Continent to England, in vats full." He called Thomas
   Hylton, a priest of Kent, one of the heretics whom he condemned to the
   flames, "the devil's stinking pot." Hylton's crime was the denial of
   the five sacraments and he was burnt 1530. [1121] As was the custom of
   the time, More's controversial works abound in scurrilous epithets. His
   opponents he distinguishes by such terms as "swine," "hellhounds that
   the devil hath in his kennel," "apes that dance for the pleasure of
   Lucifer." [1122] In his works against Tyndale and Fryth, he commended
   pilgrimages, image-worship and indulgences. He himself, so the
   chancellor wrote, had been present at Barking, 1498, when a number of
   relics were discovered which "must have been hidden since the time when
   the abbey was burnt by the infidels," and he declared that the main
   thing was that such relics were the remains of holy men, to be had in
   reverence, and it was a matter of inferior import whether the right
   names were attached to them or not." [1123]

   And yet, More resisted certain superstitions, as of the Franciscan monk
   of Coventry who publicly preached, that "whoever prayed daily through
   the Psalter to the Blessed Virgin could not be damned." He denied the
   Augustinian teaching that infants dying without baptism were consigned
   to eternal punishment and he could write to Erasmus, that Hutten's
   Epistolae obscurorum virorum delighted every one in England and that
   "under a rude scabbard the work concealed a most excellent blade."
   [1124] His intimacy with Colet and Erasmus led to an attempt on the
   part of the monks, in 1519, to secure his conversion.

   More was beatified by Leo XIII., 1886, and with St. Edmund, Bishop
   Fisher and Thomas à Becket is the chief English martyr whom English
   Catholics cultivate. He died "unwilling to jeopardize his soul to
   perpetual damnation" and expressing the hope that, "as St. Paul and St.
   Stephen met in heaven and were friends, so it might be with him and his
   judges." Gairdner is led to remark that "no man ever met an unjust doom
   in a more admirable spirit." [1125] We may concur in this judgment and
   yet we will not overlook the fact that More, gentleman as he was in
   heart, seems to us to have been unrelenting to the men whom he
   convicted as heretics and, in his writings, piled upon them epithets as
   drastic as Luther himself used. Aside from this, he is to be accorded
   praise for his advocacy of the reform in education and his commendation
   of Erasmus' Greek Testament. He wrote a special letter to the Louvain
   professor, Dorpius, upbraiding him for his attack upon the critical
   studies of Erasmus and upon the revision of the old Latin text as
   unwarranted.

   More's Utopia, written in Latin and published in 1516 with a preface by
   Budaeus, took Europe by storm. It was also called Nusquama or Nowhere.
   With Plato's Republic as a precedent, the author intended to point out
   wherein European society and especially England was at fault. In More's
   ideal commonwealth, which was set up on an island, treaties were
   observed and promises kept, and ploughmen, carpenters, wagoners,
   colliers and other artisans justly shared in the rewards of labor with
   noblemen, goldsmiths and usurers, who are called the unproductive
   classes. "The conspiracy of the rich procuring their own commodities
   under the name and title of the commonwealth" was not allowed. In
   Utopia, a proper education was given to every child, the hours of
   physical labor were reduced to six, the streets were 20 feet wide and
   the houses backed with gardens and supplied with freshwater. The
   slaughtering was done outside the towns. All punishment was for the
   purpose of reform and religion, largely a matter of family. The old
   religions continued to exist on the island, for Christianity had but
   recently been introduced, but More, apparently belying his later
   practice as judge, declared that "no man was punished for his
   religion." Its priests were of both sexes and "overseers and orderers
   of worship" rather than sacerdotal functionaries. Not to them but to
   the heads of families was confession made, the wife prostrate on the
   ground confessing to her husband, and the children to both parents. The
   priests were married.

   Little did More suspect that, within ten years of the publication of
   his famous book, texts would be drawn from it to support the Peasants'
   Revolt in Germany. [1126] In it are stated some of the sociological
   hopes and dreams of this present age. The author was voicing the
   widespread feeling of his own generation which was harassed with laws
   restricting the wages of labor, with the enclosures of the commons by
   the rich, the conversion of arable lands into sheep farms and with the
   renewed warfare on the Continent into which England was drawn. [1127]

   John Fisher, who suffered on the block a few months before More for
   refusing to take the oath of supremacy, and set aside the succession of
   Catherine of Aragon's offspring, was 79 years old when he died. Dean
   Perry has pronounced him "the most learned, the most conscientious and
   the most devout of the bishops of his day." In 1511, he recommended
   Erasmus to Cambridge to teach Greek. On the way to the place of
   beheadal, this good man carried with him the New Testament, repeating
   again and again the words, "This is life eternal to know Thee and Jesus
   Christ whom thou hast sent." "That was learning enough for him," he
   said.

   To Grocyn, Colet, More and Fisher the Protestant world gives its
   reverent regard. It is true, they did not fully apprehend the light
   which was spreading over Europe. Nevertheless, they went far as
   pioneers of a more rational system of education than the one built up
   by the scholastic method and they have a distinct place in the history
   of the progress of religious thought. [1128]

   In Scotland, the Protestant Reformation took hold of the nation before
   the Renaissance had much chance to exercise an independent influence.
   John Major, who died about 1550, wrote a commentary on the Sentences of
   Peter the Lombard and is called "the last of the Schoolmen." He is,
   however, a connecting link with the new movement in literature through
   George Buchanan, his pupil at St Andrews. Major remained true to the
   Roman communion. Buchanan, after being held for six months in prison as
   a heretic in Portugal, returned to Scotland and adopted the
   Reformation. According to Professor Hume-Brown, his Latin paraphrase of
   the Psalms in metre "was, until recent years, read in Scotland in every
   school where Latin was taught." [1129] Knox's History of the
   Reformation was the earliest model of prose literature in Scotland.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1100] Wolsey applied the proceeds of 20 monasteries, which he closed,
   to the endowment of a school at Ipswich and of Cardinal College,
   Oxford. In 1516, Fox, bishop of Winchester, founded Corpus Christi
   College at the same university to teach the new learning.

   [1101] He wrote a History of England and revenged himself by
   disparaging Wolsey, who had refused to give him his favor.

   [1102] For his services to medicine, see W. Osler; Thos. Linacre,
   Cambr., 1908, pp. 23-27.

   [1103] Nichols: Erasmus' Letters, I. 226. Sir Thomas More, writing to
   Colet, Nov., 1504, said: "I shall spend my time with Grocyn, Linacre
   and Lily. The first, as you know, is the director of my life in your
   absence, the second the master of my studies, the third my most dear
   companion."

   [1104] Seebohm, p. 283.

   [1105] See the letter. Froude: Erasmus, 139.

   [1106] Probably at Magdalen Hall. See Lupton, 23 sqq., and the same
   cautious author for Colet's school life in London. For the facts of
   Colet's career, our best authority is Erasmus' letter to Justus Jonas.

   [1107] Quoted by Lupton, p. 76.

   [1108] For the letter to the abbot of Winchcombe, in which Colet
   describes the priest's visit, see Lupton, p. 90 sqq., and Seebohm, p.
   42 sqq.

   [1109] Seebohm, p. 107.

   [1110] Seebohm gives 1510. For date and the original name, see
   correspondence in London Times, July 7, 20, 1909, between M. E. J.
   McDonnell and Gardiner, surmaster and honorable librarian of St.
   Paul's. The school was sometimes called Jesus' School by Colet. The
   buildings were finished, August, 1510. The present location of the
   school is Hammersmith.

   [1111] The statutes are given by Lupton, Appendix A., p. 271 sqq. For
   the Accidence which Colet prepared for the school, see Lupton, Appendix
   B. In contrasting the recent Latin with the Latin of classic authors,
   profane and patristic, Colet called the former "blotterature rather
   than literature." One of the rules required the boys to furnish their
   own candles, stipulating they should be of wax and not of tallow. For
   the bishop who preached against St. Paul's school as "a home of
   idolatry," see Colet's letter to Erasmus, Nichols, II. 63.

   [1112] The former is an inference from Erasmus' statement in his
   account of the visit to Walsingham, and the latter Erasmus' plain
   statement in his letter to Jonas.

   [1113] The text in Lupton, Appendix C.

   [1114] Lupton, p. 183, says Colet might aptly have referred to the case
   of the archdeacon who, in the course of his visitation, went to
   Bridlington Priory with 97 horses, 21 dogs and 8 hawks. For Colet's
   description in the Hierarchies of Dionysius of what a priest should be,
   see Lupton, p. 71; Seebohm, p. 76.

   [1115] Nichols, I. 376, II. 287. At a later time, to take More's
   statement, Colet prosecuted the study, Nichols, II. 393.

   [1116] Nichols, H. 25, 35 sqq., 72, 258, etc.

   [1117] Gasquet: The Eve of the Reformation, p. 6, insists that the
   contrary view is "absolutely false and misleading."

   Christian Man's Life. A tract by Colet reprinted in Lupton's Life, p.

   [1120] See Gasquet: Eve of the Reform., p. 215 sqq.

   [1121] What estimate was put upon the life of a heretic in some
   quarters in England may be gathered from a letter written to Erasmus,
   1511, by Ammonius, Latin secretary to Henry VIII. The writer said, he
   did "not wonder wood was so scarce and dear, the heretics necessitated
   so many holocausts." At the convocation of 1512, an old priest arguing
   for the burning of heretics repeated the passage louder and louder
   haereticum hominem devita (avoid) and explained it as if it were de
   vita tolli, to be removed from life, and thus turned the passage into a
   positive command to execute heretics. For Morels denial of having used
   cruelty towards heretics, see hisEngl. Works, p. 901 sqq. The
   martyrologist, Foxe, pronounced More "a bitter persecutor of good men
   and a wretched enemy against the truth of the Gospel."

   the affecting scenes in the last experiences recorded of men devoted to

   reported by Morels first biographer, Roper (Lumby's ed., p. liii). His
   favorite daughter, Margaret, longing once more to show her affection,
   pressed through the files of halberdiers and, embracing her father,
   kissed him and received his blessing. When she was again outside the
   ranks of the guards, she forced her way through a second time for a
   father's embrace.

   [1128] There is, of course, no standing ground except that of generous
   toleration as between the view taken by the author and the view of
   Abbot Gasquet, who can find nothing praiseworthy in the Protestant
   Reformation and closes his chapter on the Revival of Letters in
   England, in The Eve of the Reform., p. 46, with the words, "What put a
   stop to the Humanist movement in England, as it certainly did in
   Germany, was the rise of the religious difficulties which were opposed
   by those most conspicuous for their championship of true learning,
   scholarship and education," meaning Colet, Erasmus, Fisher and More.

   § 73. The Clergy.

   Both in respect of morals and education the clergy, during the period
   following the year 1450, showed improvement over the age of the Avignon
   captivity and the papal schism. Clerical practice in that former age
   was so lo that it was impossible for it to go lower and any appearance
   of true religion remain. One of the healthy signs of this latter period
   was that, in a spirit of genuine religious devotion, Savonarola in
   Italy and such men in Germany as Busch, Thomas Murner, Geiler of
   Strassburg, Sebastian Brant and the Benedictine abbot, Trithemius, held
   up to condemnation, or ridicule, priestly incompetency and worldliness.
   The pictures, which they joined Erasmus in drawing, were dark enough.
   Nevertheless, the clergy both of the higher and lower grades included
   in its ranks many men who truly sought the well-being of the people and
   set an example of purity of conduct.

   The first cause of the low condition, for low it continued to be, was
   the impossible requirement of celibacy. The infraction of this rule
   weakened the whole moral fibre of the clerical order. A second cause is
   to be looked for in the seizure of the rich ecclesiastical endowments
   by the aristocracy as its peculiar prize and securing them for the sons
   of noble parentage without regard to their moral and intellectual
   fitness. To the evils arising from these two causes must be added the
   evils arising from the unblushing practice of pluralism. No help came
   from Rome. The episcopal residences of Toledo, Constance, Paris, Mainz,
   Cologne and Canterbury could not be expected to be models of domestic
   and religious order when the tales of Boccaccio were being paralleled
   in the lives of the supreme functionaries of Christendom at its centre.

   The grave discussions of clerical manners, carried on at the Councils
   of Constance and Basel, revealed the disease without providing a cure.
   The proposition was even made by Cardinal Zabarella and Gerson, in case
   further attempts to check priestly concubinage failed, to concede to
   the clergy the privilege of marriage. [1130] In the programme for a
   reformation of the Church, offered by Sigismund at Basel, the
   concession was included and Pius II., one of the attendants on that
   synod, declared the reasons for restoring the right of matrimony to
   priests to be stronger in that day than were the reasons in a former
   age for forbidding it. The need of a relaxation of the rigid rule found
   recognition in the decrees of Eugenius IV., 1441, and Alexander VI.,
   1496, releasing some of the military orders from the vow of chastity.
   Here and there, priests like Lallier of Paris at the close of the 15th
   century, dared to propose openly, as Wyclif had done a century before,
   its full abolition. But, for making the proposal, the Sorbonne denied
   to Lallier the doctorate.

   In Spain, the efforts of synods and prelates to put a check upon
   clerical immorality accomplished little. Finally, the secular power
   intervened and repeated edicts were issued by Ferdinand and Isabella
   against priestly concubinage, 1480, 1491, 1502, 1503. So energetic was
   the attempt at enforcement that, in districts, clerics complained that
   the secular officials made forcible entrance into their houses and
   carried off their women companions. [1131] In his History of the
   Spanish Inquisition, Dr. Lea devotes a special chapter to clerical
   solicitation at the confessional. Episcopal deliverances show that the
   priests were often illiterate and without even a knowledge of Latin.
   The prelates were given to worldliness and the practice of pluralism.
   The revenues of the see of Toledo were estimated at from 80,000 to
   100,000 ducats, with patronage at the disposal of its incumbent
   amounting to a like sum. A single instance must suffice to show the
   extent to which pluralism in Spain was carried. Gonzalez de Mendoza,
   while yet a child, held the curacy of Hita, at twelve was archdeacon of
   Guadalajara, one of the richest benefices of Spain, and retained the
   bishopric of Seguenza during his successive administrations of the
   archbishoprics of Seville and Toledo. Gonzalez was a gallant knight
   and, in 1484, when he led the army which invaded Granada, he took with
   him his bastard son, Rodrigo, who was subsequently married in great
   state in the presence of Ferdinand and Isabella to Ferdinand's niece.
   In 1476, when the archbishopric of Saragossa became vacant, king Juan
   II. applied to Sixtus IV. to appoint his son, Alfonzo, a child of six,
   to the place. Sixtus declined, but after a spirited controversy
   preserved the king's good-will by appointing the boy perpetual
   administrator of the see.

   In France, the bishop of Angers, in an official address to Charles
   VIII., 1484, declared that the religious orders had fallen below the
   level of the laity in their morals. [1132] To give a case of
   extravagant pluralism, John, son of the duke of Lorraine, 1498-1550,
   was appointed bishop-coadjutor of Metz, 1501, entering into full
   possession seven years later, and, one after the other, he united with
   this preferment the bishoprics of Toul, 1517, and Térouanne, 1518,
   Valence and Die, 1521, Verdun, 1523, Alby, 1536, Macon soon after,
   Agen, 1541 and Nantes, 1542. To these were added the archbishoprics of
   Narbonne, 1524, Rheims, 1533, and Lyons, 1537. He also held at least
   nine abbeys, including Cluny. He resigned the sees of Verdun and Metz
   to a nephew, but resumed them in 1548 when this nephew married
   Marguerite d'Egmont. [1133] In 1518, he received the red hat. During
   the 15th century one boy of 10 and another of 17 filled the bishopric
   of Geneva. A loyal Romanist, Soeur Jeanne de Jussie, writing after the
   beginning of the 16th century, testifies to the dissoluteness of the
   bishops and clergy of the Swiss city and charged them with living in
   adultery. [1134]

   In Germany, although as a result of the labors of the Mystics the
   ecclesiastical condition was much better, the moral and intellectual
   unfitness was such that it calls forth severe criticism from Catholic
   as well as Protestant historians. The Catholic, Janssen, says that "the
   profligacy of the clergy at German cathedrals, as well as their
   rudeness and ignorance, was proverbial. The complaints which have come
   down to us from the 15th century of the bad morals of the German clergy
   are exceedingly numerous." Ficker, a Protestant, speaks of "the
   extraordinary immorality to which priests and monks yielded
   themselves." And Bezold, likewise a Protestant, says that "in the 15th
   century the worldliness of the clergy reached a height not possible to
   surpass." [1135] The contemporary Jacob Wimpheling, set forth probably
   the true state of the case. He was severe upon the clergy and yet spoke
   of many excellent prelates, canons and vicars, known for their piety
   and good works. He knew of a German cleric who held at one time 20
   livings, including 8 canonries. To the archbishopric of Mainz, Albrecht
   of Hohenzollern added the see of Halberstadt and the archbishopric of
   Magdeburg. For his promotion to the see of Mainz he paid 30,000 gulden,
   money he borrowed from the Fuggers.

   The bishops were charged with affecting the latest fashions in dress
   and wearing the finest textures, keeping horses and huntings dogs,
   surrounding themselves with servants and pages, allowing their beards
   and hair to grow long, and going about in green- and red-colored shoes
   and shoes punctured with holes through which ribbons were drawn. They
   were often seen in coats of mail, and accoutred with helmets and
   swords, and the tournament often witnessed them entered in the lists.
   [1136]

   The custom of reserving the higher offices of the Church for the
   aristocracy was widely sanctioned by law. As early as 1281 in Worms and
   1294 in Osnabruck, no one could be dean who was not of noble lineage.
   The office of bishop and prebend stalls were limited to men of noble
   birth by Basel, 1474, Augsburg, 1475, Münster and Paderborn, 1480, and
   Osnabruck, 1517. The same rule prevailed in Mainz, Halberstadt,
   Meissen, Merseburg and other dioceses. At the beginning of the 16th
   century, it was the established custom in Germany that no one should be
   admitted to a cathedral chapter who could not show 16 ancestors who had
   joined in the tournament and, as early as 1474, the condition of
   admission to the chapter of Cologne was that the candidate should show
   32 members of his family of noble birth. Of the 228 bishops who
   successively occupied the 32 German sees from 1400-1517, all but 13
   were noblemen. The eight occupants of the see of Münster, 1424-1508,
   were all counts or dukes. So it was with 10 archbishops of Mainz,
   1419-1514, the 7 bishops of Halberstadt, 1407-1513, and the 5
   archbishops of Cologne, 1414-1515. [1137] This custom of keeping the
   high places for men of noble birth was smartly condemned by Geiler of
   Strassburg and other contemporaries. Geiler declared that Germany was
   soaked with the folly that to the bishoprics, not the more pious and
   learned should be promoted but only those who, "as they say, belong to
   good families." It remained for the Protestant Reformation to reassert
   the democratic character of the ministry.

   A high standard could not be expected of the lower ranks of the clergy
   where the incumbents of the high positions held them, not by reason of
   piety or intellectual attainments but as the prize of birth and
   favoritism. The wonder is, that there was any genuine devotion left
   among the lower priesthood. Its ranks were greatly overstocked. Every
   family with several sons expected to find a clerical position for one
   of them and often the member of the family, least fitted by physical
   qualifications to make his way in the world, was set apart for
   religion. Here again Geiler of Strassburg applied his lash of
   indignation, declaring that, as people set apart for St. Velten the
   chicken that had the pox and for St. Anthony the pig that was affected
   with disease, so they devoted the least likely of their children to the
   holy office.

   The German village clergy of the period were as a rule not university
   bred. The chronicler, Felix Faber of Ulm, in 1490 declared that out of
   1000 priests scarcely one had ever seen a university town and a
   baccalaureate or master was a rarity seldom met with. With a sigh,
   people of that age spoke of the well-equipped priest of, the good old
   times."

   From the Alps to Scandinavia, concubinage was widely practised and in
   parts of Germany, such as Saxony, Bavaria, Austria and the Tirol, it
   was general. The region, where there was the least of it, was the
   country along the Rhine. In parts of Switzerland and other localities,
   parishes, as a measure of self-defence, forced their young pastors to
   take concubines. Two of the Swiss Reformers, Leo Jud and Bullinger,
   were sons of priests and Zwingli, a prominent priest, was given to
   incontinence before starting on his reformatory career. It was a common
   saying that the Turk of clerical sensualism within was harder to drive
   out than the Turk from the East.

   How far the conscientious effort, made in Germany in the last years of
   the Middle Ages to reform the convents, was attended with success is a
   matter of doubt. John Busch labored most energetically in that
   direction for nearly fifty years in Westphalia, Thuringia and other
   parts. The things that he records seem almost past belief. Nunneries,
   here and there, were no better than brothels. In cases, they were
   habitually visited by noblemen. The experience is told of one nobleman
   who was travelling with his servant and stopped over night at a
   convent. After the evening meal, the nuns cleared the main room and,
   dressed in fine apparel, amused their visitor by exhibitions of
   dancing. [1138] Thomas Murner went so far as to say that convents for
   women had all been turned into refuges for people of noble birth.
   [1139] The dancing during the sessions of the Diet of Cologne, 1505,
   was opened by the archbishop and an abbess, and nuns from St. Ursula's
   and St. Mary's, the king Maximilian looking on. Preachers, like Geiler
   of Strassburg, cried out against the moral dangers which beset persons
   taking the monastic vow. [1140] The cloistral life came to be known as
   "the compulsory vocation." As the time of the Reformation approached,
   there was no lessening of the outcry against the immorality of the
   clergy and convents, as appears from the writings of Ulrich von Hutten
   and Erasmus.

   The practice of priestly concubinage, uncanonical though it was,
   bishops were quite ready to turn into a means of gain, levying a tax
   upon it. In the diocese of Bamberg, a toll of 5 gulden was exacted for
   every child born to a priest and, in a single year, the tax is said to
   have brought in the considerable sum of 1,500 gulden. In 1522, a
   similar tax of 4 gulden brought into the treasury of the bishop of
   Constance, 7,500 gulden. The same year, complaint was made to the pope
   by the Diet of Nürnberg of the reckless lawlessness of young priests in
   corrupting women and of the annual tax levied in most dioceses upon all
   the clergy without distinction whether they kept concubines or not.
   [1141] It is not surprising, in view of these facts, that Luther called
   upon monks and nuns unable to avoid incontinence of thought, to come
   forth from the monasteries and marry. On the other hand, it must not be
   forgotten that no plausible charge of incontinence was made against the
   Reformer.

   If we turn to England, we are struck with the great dearth of
   contemporary religious literature, 1450-1517, as compared with Germany.
   [1142] Few writings have come down to us from which to form a judgment
   of the condition of the clergy. Our deductions must be drawn in part
   from the testimonies of the English Humanists and Reformers and from
   the records of the visitations of monasteries and also their
   suppression under Henry VIII. In a document, drawn up at the request of
   Henry V. by the University of Oxford, 1414, setting forth the need of a
   reformation of the Church, one of the articles pronounced the
   "undisguised profligacy of the clergy to be the scandal of the Church."
   [1143] In the middle of the century, 1455, Archbishop Bourchier's
   Commission for Reforming the Clergy spoke of the marriage and
   concubinage of the secular clergy and the gross ignorance which, in
   quarters, marked them. In the latter part of the century, 1489, the
   investigation of the convents, undertaken by Archbishop Morton,
   uncovered an unsavory state of affairs. The old abbey of St. Albans,
   for example, had degenerated till it was little better than a house of
   prostitution for monks. In two priories under the abbey's jurisdiction,
   the nuns had been turned out to give place to avowed courtesans. The
   Lollards demanded the privilege of wedlock for priests. When, in 1494,
   30 of their number were arraigned by Robert Blacater, archbishop of
   Glasgow, one of the charges against them was their assertion that
   priests had wives in the primitive Church. [1144] Writing at the very
   close of the 15th century, Colet exclaimed, "Oh, the abominable impiety
   of those miserable priests, of whom this age of ours contains a great
   multitude, who fear not to rush from the arms of some foul harlot into
   the temple of the Church, to the altar of Christ, to the mysteries of
   God." [1145] The famous tract, the Beggars' Petition, written on the
   eve of the British Reformation, accused the clergy of having no other
   serious occupation than the destruction of the peace of family life and
   the corruption of women. [1146]

   As for the practice of plural livings, it was perhaps as much in vogue
   in England as in Germany. Dr. Sherbourne, Colet's predecessor as dean
   of St. Paul's, was a notable example of a pluralist, but in this
   respect was exceeded by Morton and Wolsey. As for the ignorance of the
   English clergy, it is sufficient to refer to the testimony of Bishop
   Hooper who, during his visitation in Gloucester, 1551, found 168 of 811
   clergymen unable to repeat the Ten Commandments, 40 who could not tell
   where the Lord's Prayer was to be found and 31 unable to give the
   author. [1147]

   In Scotland, the state of the clergy in pre-Reformation times was
   probably as low as in any other part of Western Europe. [1148] John
   IV.'s bastard son was appointed bishop of St. Andrews at 16 and the
   illegitimate sons of James V., 1513-1542, held the five abbeys of
   Holyrood, Kelso, St. Andrews, Melrose and Coldingham. Bishops lived
   openly in concubinage and married their daughters into the ranks of the
   nobility. In the marriage document, certifying the nuptials of Cardinal
   Beaton's eldest daughter to the Earl of Crawford, 1546, the cardinal
   called her his child. On the night of his murder, he is said to have
   been with his favorite mistress, Marion Ogilvie.

   Side by side with the decline of the monastic institutions, there
   prevailed among the monks of the 15th century a most exaggerated notion
   of the sanctifying influence of the monastic vow. According to Luther,
   the monks of his day recognized two grades of Christians, the perfect
   and the imperfect. To the former the monastics belonged. Their vow was
   regarded as a second baptism which cleared those who received it from
   all stain, restored them to the divine image and put them in a class
   with the angels. Luther was encouraged by his superiors to feel, after
   he had taken the vow, that he was as pure as a child. This second
   regeneration had been taught by St. Bernard and Thomas Aquinas. Thomas
   said that it may with reason be affirmed that any one "entering
   religion," that is, taking the monastic vow, thereby received remission
   of sins. [1149]

   § 74. Preaching.

   The two leading preachers of Europe during the last 50 years of the
   Middle Ages were Jerome Savonarola of Florence and John Geiler of
   Strassburg. Early in the 15th century, Gerson was led by the ignorance
   of the clergy to recommend a reduction of preaching, [1150] but in the
   period just before the Reformation there was a noticeable revival of
   the practice of preaching in Germany and a movement in that direction
   was felt in England. Erasmus, as a cosmopolitan scholar made an appeal
   for the function of the pulpit, which went to all portions of Western
   Europe.

   In Germany, the importance of the sermon was emphasized by synodal
   decrees and homiletic manuals. Such synods were the synods of
   Eichstädt, 1463, Bamberg, 1491, Basel, 1503, Meissen, 1504. Surgant's
   noted Handbook on the Art of Preaching praised the sermon as the
   instrument best adapted to lead the people to repentance and inflame
   Christian love and called it "the way of life, the ladder of virtue and
   the gate of paradise." [1151] It was pronounced as much a sin to let a
   word from the pulpit fall unheeded as to spill a drop of the
   sacramental wine. In the penitential books and the devotional manuals
   of the time, stress was laid upon the duty of attending preaching, as
   upon the mass. Those who left church before the sermon began were
   pronounced deserving excommunication. Wolff's penitential manual of
   1478 made the neglect of the sermon a violation of the 4th commandment.
   The efficacy of sermons was vouched for in the following story. A good
   man met the devil carrying a bag full of boxes packed with salves.
   Holding up a black box, the devil said that he used it to put people to
   sleep during the preaching service. The preachers, he continued,
   greatly interfered with his work, and often by a single sermon snatched
   from him persons he had held in his power for 30 or 40 years. [1152]

   By the end of the 15th century, all the German cities and most of the
   larger towns had regular preaching. [1153] It was a common thing to
   endow pulpits, as in Mainz, 1465, Basel, 1469, Strassburg, 1478,
   Constance, Augsburg, Stuttgart and other cities. The popular preachers
   drew large audiences. So it was with Geiler of Strassburg, whose
   ministry lasted 30 years. 10,000 are said to have gathered to hear the
   sermons of the barefooted monk, Jacob Mene of Cologne, when he held
   forth at Frankfurt, the people standing in the windows and crowding up
   against the organ to hear him. It was Mene's practice to preach a
   sermon from 7-8 in the morning, and again after the noon meal. On a
   certain Good Friday he prolonged his effort five hours, from 3-8 P. M.
   According to Luther, towns were glad to give itinerant monks 100 gulden
   for a series of Lenten discourses.

   Other signs of the increased interest felt in sermons were the
   homiletic cyclopaedias of the time furnishing materials derived from
   the Bible, the Fathers, classic authors and from the realm of tale and
   story. To these must be added the plenaria, collections from the
   Gospels and Epistles with glosses and comments. The plenarium of
   Guillermus, professor in Paris, went through 75 editions before 1500.
   Collections of model sermons were also issued, some of which had an
   extensive circulation. The collection of John Nider, d. 1439, passed
   through 17 editions. His texts were invariably subjected to a threefold
   division. The collection of the Franciscan, John of Werden, who died at
   Cologne about 1450, passed through 25 editions. John Herolt's volume of
   Sermons of a Disciple -- Sermones discipuli -- went through 41 editions
   before 1500 and is computed to have had a circulation of no less than
   40,000 copies. [1154] One of the most popular of the collections called
   Parati sermones--The Ready Man's Sermons -- appeared anonymously. Its
   title was taken from 1 Peter 4:6, "ready--paratus -- to judge the quick
   and the dead" and Ps. 119:60, "I made haste [ready] and delayed not to
   observe thy commandments." In setting forth the words "Be not unwise
   but understanding what the will of the Lord is" the author says that
   such wisdom is taught by the animals. 1. By the lion who brushes out
   his paw-prints with his tail so that the hunter is thrown off the
   track. So we should with penance erase the marks of our sins that the
   devil may not find us out. 2. The serpent which closes both ears to the
   seducer, one ear with his tail and the other by holding it to the
   ground. Against the devil we should shut our ears by the two thoughts
   of death and eternity. 3. The ant from which we learn industry in
   making provision for the future. 4. A certain kind of fish which sucks
   itself fast to the rock in times of storm. So we should adhere closely
   to the rock, Christ Jesus, by thoughts of his passion and thus save
   ourselves from the surging of the waves of the world. Such materials
   show that the homiletic instinct was alert and the preachers anxious to
   catch the attention of the people and impart biblical truth.

   The sermons of the German preachers of the 15th century were written
   now in Latin, now in German. The more famous of the Latin sermonizers
   were Gabriel Biel, preacher in Mainz and then professor in Tübingen, d.
   1495, and Jacob Jüterbock, 1883-1465, Carthusian prior in Erfurt and
   professor in the university in that city. [1155] Among the notable
   preachers who preached in German were John Herolt of Basel, already
   mentioned; the Franciscan John Gritsch whose sermons reached 26
   editions before 1500; the Franciscan, John Meder of Basel whose Lenten
   discourses on the Prodigal Son of the year 1494 reached 36 editions and
   Ulrich Krafft, pastor in Ulm, 1500 to 1516, and author of the two
   volumes, The Spiritual Battle and Noah's Ark.

   More famous than all others was Geiler of Strassburg, usually called
   from his father's birthplace, Geiler of Kaisersberg, born in
   Schaffhausen, 1445, died in Strassburg, 1510. He and his predecessor,
   Bertholdt of Regensburg, have the reputation of being the most powerful
   preachers of mediaeval Germany. For more than a quarter of a century he
   stood in the cathedral pulpit of Strassburg, the monarch of preachers
   in the North. After pursuing his university studies in Freiburg and
   Basel, Geiler was made professor at Freiburg, 1476. His pulpit efforts
   soon made him a marked man. In accepting the call as preacher in the
   cathedral at Strassburg, he entered into a contract to preach every
   Sunday and on all festival and fast days. He continued to fill the
   pulpit till within two months of his death and lies interred in the
   cathedral where he preached. [1156]

   "The Trumpet of Strassburg," as Geiler was called, gained his fame as a
   preacher of moral and social reforms. He advocated no doctrinal
   changes. Called upon, 1500, to explain his public declaration that the
   city councillors were "all of the devil," he issued 21 articles
   demanding that games of chance be prohibited, drinking halls closed,
   the Sabbath and festival days observed, the hospitals properly cared
   for and monkish mendicancy regulated.

   He was a preacher of the people and now amused, now stung them, by
   anecdotes, plays on words, descriptions, proverbs, sallies of wit,
   humor and sarcasm. [1157] He attacked popular follies and fashions and
   struck at the priests "many of whom never said mass," and at the
   convents in which "neither religion nor virtue was found and the living
   was lax, lustful, dissolute and fall of all levity." [1158] Mediaeval
   superstition he served up to his hearers in good doses. He was a firm
   believer in astrology, ghosts and witches.

   Geiler's style may seem rude to the polite age in which we live, but it
   reached the ear of his own time. The high as well as the low listened.
   Maximilian went to hear Geiler when he was in Strassburg. No one could
   be in doubt about the preacher's meaning. In a series of 65 passion
   sermons, he elaborated a comparison between Christ and a ginger
   cake--the German Lebkuchen. Christ is composed of the bean meal of the
   deity, the old fruit meal of the body and the wheat meal of the soul.
   To these elements is added the honey of compassion. He was thrust into
   the oven of affliction and is divided by preachers into many parts and
   distributed among the people. In other sermons, he compared perfect
   Christians to sausages.

   In seven most curious discourses on Der Hase im Pfeffer an idiomatic
   expression for That's the Rub--based on Prov. 30:26, "The coney is a
   weak folk," he made 14 comparisons between the coney and the good
   Christian. The coney runs better up hill than down, as a good Christian
   should do. The coney has long ears as also a Christian should have,
   especially monastics, attending to what God has to say. The coney must
   be roasted; and so must also the Christian pass through the furnace of
   trial. The coney being a lank beast must be cooked in lard, so also
   must the Christian be surrounded with love and devotion lest he be
   scorched in the furnace. In 64 discourses, preached two years before
   his death, Geiler brought out the spiritual lessons to be derived from
   ants and in another series he elaborated the 25 sins of the tongue. In
   a course of 20 sermons to business men, he depicted the six market days
   and the devil as a pedler(sic) going about selling his wares. He
   preached 17 sermons on the lion in which the king of beasts was
   successively treated as the symbol of the good man, the worldly man,
   Christ and the devil; 12 of these sermons were devoted to the ferocious
   activities of the devil. A series on the Human Tree comprised no less
   than 163 discourses running from the beginning of Lent, 1495, to the
   close of Lent, 1496.

   During the last two years of the 15th century, Geiler preached 111
   homilies on Sebastian Brant's Ship of Fools Narren-schiff -- all drawn
   from the text Eccles. 1:15 as it reads in the Vulgate, "the fools are
   without number." Through Geiler's intervention Brant had been brought
   to Strassburg from Basel, where he was professor. His famous work,
   which is a travesty upon the follies of his time, employed the figure
   of a ship for the transport of his fools because it was the largest
   engine of transportation the author knew of. Very humorously Brant
   placed himself in the moderator's chair while all the other fools were
   gathered in front of him. He himself took the rôle of the Book-fool.
   Among other follies which are censured are the doings of the
   mendicants, the traffic in relics and indulgences and the
   multiplication of benefices in single hands. [1159] Geiler's homilies
   equal Brant's poetry in humor. Both were true to life. No preacher of
   the Middle Ages held the popular ear so long as Geiler of Strassburg
   and no popular poet, not even Will Langland, more effectually wrote for
   the masses than Sebastian Brant.

   In this period, the custom came to be quite general to preach from the
   nave of the church instead of from the choir railing. Preachers limited
   their discourses by hour-glasses, a custom later transplanted to New
   England. [1160] Sermons were at times unduly extended. Gerhard Groote
   sometimes preached for three hours during Lent and John Gronde extended
   some of his discourses to six hours, mercifully, however, dividing them
   into two parts with a brief breathing-spell between, profitable as may
   well be surmised alike to the preacher and the hearers. Geiler, who at
   one time had been inclined to preach on without regard to time, limited
   his discourses to a single hour.

   The criticisms which preachers passed upon the customs of the day show
   that human nature was pretty much the same then as it is now and that
   the "good old times" are not to be sought for in that age. All sorts of
   habits were held up to ridicule and scorn. Drunkenness and gluttony,
   the dance and the street comedy, the dress of women and the idle
   lounging of rich men's sons, usury and going to church to make a parade
   were among the subjects dwelt upon. Again and again, Geiler of
   Strassburg returned to the lazy sons of the rich who spent their time
   in retailing scandals and doing worse, more silly in their dress than
   the women, fops who "thought themselves somebody because their fathers
   were rich." He also took special notice of women and their fripperies.
   He condemned their belts, sometimes made of silk and adorned with gold,
   costing as much as 40 or 50 gulden, their padded busts and their
   extensive wardrobes, enabling them to wear for a week at a time two
   different garments each day and a third one for a dancing party or the
   play. He launched out against their long hair, left to fall down over
   the back and crowned with ribbons or small caps such as the men wore.
   As examples of warning, Absalom and Holofernes were singled out, the
   former caught by his hair in the branches of the tree and Holofernes
   ensnared by the adornments of Judith. Geiler called upon the city
   authorities to come to the help of society and the preacher and
   legislate against such evils. [1161]

   Another preacher, Hollen, condemned the long trails which women wore as
   "the devil's wagon," for neither men nor angels but only the devil has
   a caudal appendage. As for dancing, especially the round dances, the
   devil was the head concertmaster at such entertainments and the higher
   the dancers jumped, the deeper their fall into hell and, the more
   firmly they held on to each other with their hands, the more closely
   did the devil tighten his hold upon them. Dancing was represented by
   the preachers as an occasion of much profligacy.

   In ridiculing the preaching of his day, Erasmus held forth the
   preachers' ignorance, their incongruous introductions, their use of
   stories from all departments without any discrimination, their old
   women's tales and the frivolous topics they chose--aniles fabulae et
   questiones frivolse. A famous passage in which the great scholar
   disparages the preaching of the monks and friars begins with the words:
   --

   All their preaching is mere stage-playing, and their delivery the very
   transports of ridicule and drollery. Good Lord! how mimical are these
   gestures! What heights and falls in their voice! What toning, what
   bawling, what singing, what squeaking, what grimaces, making of months,
   apes' faces, and distorting of their countenance; and this art of
   oratory as a choice mystery, they convey down by tradition to one
   another. [1162]

   Erasmus deserves credit for discerning the need of the times, and
   recommending the revival of the practice of preaching and the mission
   of preachers to the heathen nations. His views were set forth in the
   Ecclesiastes or Preacher, a work written during the Freiburg period and
   filling 275 pages, [1163] each double the size of the pages of the
   hardcopy volume. The chief purpose of preaching he defined to be
   instruction. Every preacher is a herald of Christ, who was himself the
   great preacher. The office of preaching is superior in dignity to the
   office of kings. "Among the charisms of the Spirit, none is more noble
   and efficacious than preaching. To be a dispenser of the celestial
   philosophy and a messenger of the divine will is excelled by no office
   in the church." It is quite in accord with Erasmus' high regard for the
   teaching function, that he magnifies the instructional element of the
   sermon. Writing to Sapidus, 1516, he said, "to be a schoolmaster is
   next to being a king." [1164]

   Of the English pulpit, there is little to say. We hear of preaching at
   St. Paul's Cross and at other places, but there is no evidence that
   preaching was usual. No volumes of English sermons issued from the
   printing-press. Colet is the only English preacher of the 15th century
   of historical importance. The churchly counsel given to priests to
   impart instruction to the people, issued by the Lambeth synod of 1281,
   stands almost solitary. In 1466, Archbishop Nevill of York did no more
   than to repeat this legislation.

   In Scotland the history of the pulpit begins with Knox. Dr. Blaikie
   remarks that, for the three centuries before the Reformation, scarcely
   a trace of Christian preaching can be found in Scotland worthy the
   name. The country had no Wyclif, as it had no Anselm. [1165] Hamilton
   and Wishart, Knox's immediate forerunners, were laymen.

   The Abbé Dr. Gasquet in a chapter on A Forgotten English Preacher in
   his Old Eng. Bible and other Essays gives extracts from the MS. sermon
   of Thomas Branton, Bishop of Rochester, 1372-1389. After saying that we
   know very little about mediaeval preaching in England, Dr. Gasquet, p.
   54, remarks that it is perhaps just as well, as the sermons were
   probably dull and that "the modern sermon" has to be endured as a
   necessary evil. In his chapter on Teaching and Preaching, pp. 244-284,
   in his Eve of the Reformation, the same author returns to the subject,
   but the chapter itself gives the strongest evidence of the literary
   barrenness of the English Church in the closing years of the Middle
   Ages and the dearth of preaching and public instruction. By far the
   larger part of the chapter, pp. 254-280, is taken up with quotations
   from Sir Thomas More, the tract Dives and Pauper and other tracts, to
   show that the doctrine of the worship of images and saints was not
   taught in its crass form and with a statement of the usefulness of
   miracle-plays as a means of popular religious instruction. Dr. Gasquet
   lays stress upon the "simple instruction" given by the English
   priesthood in the Middle Ages as opposed to formal sermons which he
   confesses "were probably by no means so frequent as in these times." He
   makes the astounding assertion, p. 245, that religions instruction as a
   means of social and moral improvement was not one of the primary aims
   of the Reformation. The very opposite is proved by the efforts of
   Luther, Calvin and Knox to secure the establishment of schools in every
   hamlet and the catechisms which the two former prepared and the
   numerous catechisms prepared by their fellow Reformers. And what of
   their habit of constant preaching? Luther preached day after day. One
   of the first signs of the Reformation in Geneva was that St. Pierre and
   St. Gervaise were opened for preaching daily. Calvin incorporated into
   his ecclesiastical polity as one of the orders the ministry, the
   teaching body.

   § 75. Doctrinal Reformers.

   A group of theologians appeared in Northwestern Germany who, on the one
   hand, were closely associated by locality and training with the
   Brothers of the Common Life and, on the other, anticipated the coming
   age by the doctrinal reforms which they proposed. On the latter
   account, John of Goch, John of Wesel and Wessel of Gansfort have been
   properly classed with Wyclif and Huss as Reformers before the
   Reformation. [1166] Erasmus has no place at their side for, with his
   satire on ceremonies and church conditions, the question is always
   raised of his sincerity. Savonarola suggested no doctrinal changes.
   Among the new views emphasized by one or all of these three men were
   the final authority of the Scriptures, the fallibility of the pope, the
   sufficiency of divine grace for salvation irrespective of priestly
   mediation, and the distinction between the visible and the invisible
   Church. However, but for the Protestant Reformation, it is not probable
   their voices would have been heard beyond the century in which they
   lived.

   John Pupper, 1400-1475, usually called John of Goch from his
   birthplace, a hamlet on the lower Rhine near Cleves, seems to have been
   trained in one of the schools of the Brothers of the Common Life, and
   then studied in Cologne and perhaps in Paris. He founded a house of
   Augustinians near Mecheln, remaining at its head till his death. His
   writings were not published till after the beginning of the
   Reformation. He anticipated that movement in asserting the supreme
   authority of the Bible. The Fathers are to be accepted only so far as
   they follow the canonical Scriptures. In contrast to the works of the
   philosophers and the Schoolmen, the Bible is a book of life; theirs,
   books of death. [1167] He also called in question the merit of monastic
   vows and the validity of the distinction between the higher and lower
   morality upon which monasticism laid stress. What is included under the
   higher morality is within the reach of all Christians and not the
   property of monks only. He renounced the Catholic view of justification
   without stating with clearness the evangelical theory. [1168]

   John Ruchrath von Wesel, d. 1481, attacked the hierarchy and
   indulgences and was charged on his trial with calling in question
   almost all the distinctive Roman Catholic tenets. He was born in
   Oberwesel on the Rhine between Mainz and Coblentz. He taught at the
   University of Erfurt and, in 1458, was chosen its vice-rector. Luther
   bore testimony to his influence when he said, "I remember how Master
   John Wesalia ruled the University of Erfurt by his writings through the
   study of which I also became a master." [1169] Leaving Erfurt, he was
   successively professor in Basel and cathedral preacher in Mainz and
   Worms.

   In 1479, Wesel was arraigned for heresy before the Inquisition at
   Mainz. [1170] Among the charges were that the Scriptures are alone a
   trustworthy source of authority; the names of the predestinate are
   written in the book of life and cannot be erased by a priestly ban;
   indulgences do not profit; Christ is not pleased with festivals of
   fasting, pilgrimages or priestly celibacy; Christ's body can be in the
   bread without any change of the bread's substance: pope and councils
   are not to be obeyed if they are out of accord with the Scriptures; he
   whom God chooses will be saved irrespective of pope and priests, and
   all who have faith will enjoy as much blessedness as prelates. Wesel
   also made the distinction between the visible and the invisible Church
   and defined the Church as the aggregation of all the faithful who are
   bound together by love--collectio omnium fidelium caritate copulatorum.
   In his trial, he was accused of having had communication with the
   Hussites. In matters of historical criticism, he was also in advance of
   his age, casting doubt upon some of the statements of the Athanasian
   Creed, abandoning the application of the term Catholic to the Apostles'
   Creed and pronouncing the addition of the filioque clause--and from the
   Son--unwarranted. The doctrines of indulgences and the fund of merit he
   pronounced unscriptural and pious frauds. The elect are saved wholly
   through the grace of God--sola Dei gratia salvantur electi.

   At the request of Diether of Isenburg, archbishop of Mainz, the
   Universities of Cologne and Heidelberg sent delegates to the trial. The
   accused was already an old man, leaning on his staff, when he appeared
   before the tribunal. Lacking strength to stand by the heretical
   articles, he agreed to submit "to mother Church and the teachings of
   the doctors." A public recantation in the cathedral followed, and his
   books were burnt. [1171] These punishments were not sufficient to
   expiate his offence and he was sentenced to imprisonment for life in
   the Augustinian convent of Mainz, where he died.

   Among Wesel's reported sayings, which must have seemed most blasphemous
   to the devout churchman of the time, are the following: "The
   consecrated oil is not better than the oil used for your cakes in the
   kitchen." "If you are hungry, eat. You may eat a good capon on Friday."
   "If Peter established fasting, it was in order that he might get more
   for his fish" on fast days. To certain monastics, he said, "Not
   religion" (that is, monastic vows) "but God's grace saves," religio
   nullum salvat sed gratia Dei.

   A still nearer approach to the views of the Reformers was made by
   Wessel Gansfort, commonly called John Wessel, [1172] born in Groningen,
   1420, died 1489. In his Preface to Wessel's writings, 1522, Luther
   said, "If I had read Wessel earlier, my enemies might have said that
   Luther drew everything from Wessel, so well do our two minds agree."
   Wessel attended school at Zwolle, where he met Thomas à Kempis of the
   neighboring convent of Mt. St. Agnes. The story ran that when Thomas
   pointed him to the Virgin, Wessel replied, "Father, why did you not
   rather point me to Christ who calls the heavy-laden to himself?" He
   continued his studies in Cologne, where he took Greek and Hebrew, in
   Heidelberg and in Paris. He declined a call to Heidelberg. In 1470, we
   find him in Rome. The story went that, when Sixtus IV. invited him to
   follow the common custom of visitors to the Vatican and make a request,
   the German student replied that he would like to have a Hebrew or Greek
   manuscript of the Bible from the Vatican. The pope, laughing, said,
   "Why did you not ask for a bishopric, you fool?" Wessel's reply was
   "Because I do not need it."

   Wessel spent some time in Basel, where he met Reuchlin. In 1473, the
   bishop of Utrecht wrote that many were seeking his life and invited him
   back to Holland. His last years, from 1474 on, Wessel spent with the
   Brothers of the Common Life at Mt. St. Agnes, and in the nuns' convent
   at Groningen. There, in the place of his birth, he lies buried. His
   last words were, "I know no one save Jesus, the Crucified."

   Wessel enjoyed a reputation for great learning. He escaped arraignment
   at the hands of the Inquisition, but was violently attacked after his
   death in a tract on indulgences, by Jacob Hoeck, Dean of Naaldwyk. None
   of Wessel's writings were published till after the outbreak of the
   Reformation. Although he did not reach the doctrine of justification by
   faith, he declared that pope and councils may err and he defined the
   Church to be the communion of the saints. The unity of the Church does
   not lie in the pope--unitas ecclesiae sub uno papa tantum accidentalis
   est, adeo ut non sit necessaria. He laid stress upon the faith of the
   believer in partaking of the eucharist or, rather, upon his hunger and
   thirst after the sacrament. But he did not deny the sacrifice of the
   mass or the validity of the communion under one kind. He gave up the
   judicial element in priestly absolution. [1173] There is no such thing
   as works of supererogation, for each is under obligation to do all he
   can and to do less is to sin. The prerogative of the keys belongs to
   all believers. Plenary indulgences are a detestable invention of the
   papacy to fill its treasury.

   In 1522, a Dutch lawyer, von Hoen, joining with other Netherlanders,
   sent Luther a copy of some of Wessel's writings. [1174] In the preface
   which the Reformer wrote for the Wittenberg edition, he said that, as
   Elijah of old, so he had felt himself to be the only one left of the
   prophets of God but he had found out that God had also had his prophets
   in secret like Wessel.

   These three German theologians, Goch, Wesel and Wessel, were quietly
   searching after the marks of the true Church and the doctrine of
   justification by faith in Christ alone. Without knowing it, they were
   standing on the threshold of the Reformation.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1166] This group of men forms the subject of Ullmann's notable work
   The Reformers before the Reformation published in 1841. He followed
   Flacius, Walch and others before him who had treated them as precursors
   of the Reformation. Hase: Kirchengesch., II. 551; Köstlin: Leben
   Luthers, I. 18; Funk, p. 382, and others still hold to this
   classification. Loofs: Dogmengesch., p. 658, takes another view and
   says "they were not Reformers before the Reformation, nevertheless they
   bear witness that, in the closing years of the Middle Ages, the
   preparation made for the Reformation was not, merely negative."
   Janssen, I. 745, treats them as followers of Huss.

   [1167] Goch's words are Sola scriptura canonica fidem indubiam et
   irrefragabilem habet auctoritatem. The writer in Wetzer-Welte concedes
   Goch's depreciation of the Schoolmen and of Thomas Aquinas in
   particular, whom at one point Goch calls a prince of error--princeps
   erroris.

   [1168] Ullmann, I. 91, 149 sqq., asserts that Goch stated the doctrine
   of justification by faith alone. Clemen and the writer in Wetzer-Welte
   modify this judgment. Walch, as quoted by Ullmann, p. 150, gives 9
   points in which Goch anticipated the Reformation.

   [1169] Catholic writers like Funk, p. 390, Wetzer-Welte and Janssen, I.
   746, speak of Wesel as one of the false teachers of the Middle Ages and
   find many of the doctrines of the Reformation in his writings.

   [1170] For detailed account of the trial, Ullman, I. 383-405.

   [1171] During his trial, Wesel acknowledged the following writing as
   his: 1, Super modo obligationis legum humanarum ad quemdam Nicolaum de
   Bohemia. 2, De potestate actes. 3, De jeuniis. 4, De indulgentiis.

   [1172] The name, "John" is disputed by Muurling and Wetzer-Welte and
   shown by Paulus to be a mistake. Gansfort, or Goesevort, was the name
   of the village from which the family came.

   [1173] See Ritschl: The Christian Doctr. of Justification and
   Reconciliation. Edinb. ed., p. 481 sq.

   [1174] In a letter accompanying the gift, Honius wrote that the words
   "This is my body" meant "This represents my body." For Luther's reply,
   see Köstlin: Luthers Leben, I. 701. For the lat edd. of Wessel's works,
   see Doedes, pp. 435, 442. Doedes in Studien u. Kritiken, for 1870, p.
   409, asks, "Who in the latter half of the 15th cent. had so much
   genuine faith and evangelical knowledge as this man who was always the
   scholar of the Lord Jesus Christ and nothing else?"

   § 76. Girolamo Savonarola.

   Ecce gladius Domini super terram cito et velociter.

   In the closing decade of the 15th century the city of Florence seemed
   to be on the eve of becoming a model municipality, a pattern of
   Christian morals, a theocracy in which Christ was acknowledged as
   sovereign. In the movement looking towards this change, the chief actor
   was Jerome Savonarola, prior of the


   [picture with title below]

   Savonarola

   Dominican convent of St. Mark's, the most imposing preacher of the
   Middle Ages and one of the most noteworthy preachers of righteousness
   since St. Paul. Against the dark moral background of his generation he
   appears as a broad sheet of northern light with its coruscations,
   mysterious and protentous, but also quickly disappearing. His message
   was the prophet's cry, "Who shall abide the day of His coming and who
   shall stand when He appeareth?"

   Savonarola, born in Ferrara Sept. 21, 1452, died in Florence May 23,
   1498, was the third of seven children. Choosing his grandfather's
   profession, he entered upon the study of medicine, from which he was
   turned away by a deepening impression of the corruption of society and
   disappointment at the refusal of a family of Strozzi, living at
   Ferrara, to give him their daughter in marriage. At the age of 23, he
   secretly left his father's house and betook himself to Bologna, where
   he assumed the Dominican habit. Two days after his arrival in Bologna,
   he wrote thus to his father explaining the reason of his abrupt
   departure.

   I could not endure any longer the wickedness of the blinded peoples of
   Italy. Virtue I saw despised everywhere and vices exalted and held in
   honor. With great warmth of heart, I made daily a short prayer to God
   that He might release me from this vale of tears. 'Make known to me the
   way,' I cried, 'the way in which I should walk for I lift up my soul
   unto Thee,' and God in His infinite mercy showed me the way, unworthy
   as I am of such distinguishing grace. [1175]

   He begged his father to console his mother and referred him to a poem
   by his pen on the contempt of the world, which he had left among his
   papers. In this letter and several letters to his mother, which are
   extant, is shown the young monk's warm affection for his parents and
   his brothers and sisters.

   In the convent, the son studied Augustine and Thomas Aquinas and became
   familiar with the Scriptures, sections of which he committed to memory.
   Two copies of the Bible are extant in Florence, containing copious
   notes in Savonarola's own handwriting, made on the margin, between the
   printed lines and on added leaves. [1176] After his appointment as
   provincial, he emphasized the study of the Bible in Hebrew and Greek.

   In 1481, he was sent to Florence, where he became an inmate of St.
   Mark's. The convent had been rebuilt by Cosimo de Medici and its walls
   illuminated by the brush of Fra Angelico. At the time of Savonarola's
   arrival, the city was at the height of its fame as a seat of culture
   and also as the place of lighthearted dissipation under the brilliant
   patronage of Lorenzo the Magnificent.

   The young monk's first efforts in the pulpit in Florence were a
   failure. The congregation at San Lorenzo, where he preached during the
   Lenten season, fell to 25 persons. Fra Mariano da Gennazzano, an
   Augustinian, was the popular favorite. The Dominican won his first fame
   by his Lenten sermons of 1486, when he preached at Brescia on the Book
   of Revelation. He represented one of the 24 elders rising up and
   pronouncing judgments upon the city for its wickedness. In 1489, he was
   invited back to Florence by Lorenzo at the suggestion of Pico della
   Mirandola, who had listened to Savonarola's eloquence at Reggio. During
   the remaining nine years of his life, the city on the Arno was filled
   with Savonarola's personality. With Catherine of Siena, he shares the
   fame of being the most religious of the figures that have walked its
   streets. During the first part of this short period, he had conflict
   with Lorenzo and, during the second, with Alexander VI., all the while
   seeking by his startling warnings and his prophecies to bring about the
   regeneration of the city and make it a model of civic and social
   righteousness. From Aug. 1, 1490, when he appeared in the pulpit of St.
   Mark's, the people thronged to hear him whether he preached there or in
   the cathedral. In 1491, he was made prior of his convent. To preaching
   he added writings in the department of philosophy and tracts on
   humility, prayer and the love of Jesus. He was of middle height, dark
   complexion, lustrous eyes dark gray in color, thick lips and aquiline
   nose. His features, which of themselves would have been called coarse,
   attracted attention by the serious contemplative expression which
   rested upon them, and the flash of his eye.

   Savonarola's sermons were like the flashes of lightning and the
   reverberations of thunder. It was his mission to lay the axe at the
   root of dissipation and profligacy rather than to depict the
   consolations of pardon and communion with God. He drew more upon the
   threatenings of the divine wrath than upon the refreshing springs of
   the divine compassion. Tender descriptions of the divine love and mercy
   were not wanting in his sermons, but the woes pronounced upon the
   sinfulness of his time exceeded the gentle appeals. He was describing
   his own method, when he said, "I am like the hail. Cover thyself lest
   it come down upon thee, and strike thee. And remember that I said unto
   thee, Cover thy head with a helmet, that is clothe thyself with virtue
   and no hail stone will touch thee." [1177]

   In the time of his greatest popularity, the throngs waited hours at the
   doors of the cathedral for the preacher's arrival and it has been
   estimated by Villari, that audiences of 10,000 or 12,000 hung on his
   discourses. Like fields of grain under the wind, the feelings of his
   audiences were swayed by the preacher's voice. Now they burned with
   indignation: now they were softened to tears. "I was overcome by
   weeping and could not go on." So wrote the reporter while taking down a
   sermon, and Savonarola himself felt the terrible strain of his efforts
   and often sank back into his seat completely exhausted. His message was
   directed to the clergy, high and low, as well as to the people and the
   flashes of his indignation often fell upon the palace of Lorenzo. The
   clergy he arraigned for their greed of prebends and gold and their
   devotion to outer ceremonies rather than to the inner life of the soul.
   Florence he addressed in endearing terms as the object of his love. "My
   Florence," he was wont to exclaim. Geneva was no more the city of
   Calvin or Edinburgh of Knox than was Florence the city of Savonarola.
   Portraying the insincerity of the clergy, he said: --

   In these days, prelates and preachers are chained to the earth by the
   love of earthly things. The care of souls is no longer their concern.
   They are content with the receipt of revenue. The preachers preach to
   please princes and to be praised by them. They have done worse. They
   have not only destroyed the Church of God. They have built up a new
   Church after their own pattern. Go to Rome and see! In the mansions of
   the great prelates there is no concern save for poetry and the
   oratorical art. Go thither and see! Thou shalt find them all with the
   books of the humanities in their hands and telling one another that
   they can guide mens' souls by means of Virgil, Horace and Cicero ...
   The prelates of former days had fewer gold mitres and chalices and what
   few they possessed were broken up and given to relieve the needs of the
   poor. But our prelates, for the sake of obtaining chalices, will rob
   the poor of their sole means of support. Dost thou not know what I
   would tell thee! What doest thou, O Lord! Arise, and come to deliver
   thy Church from the hands of devils, from the hands of tyrants, from
   the hands of iniquitous prelates. [1178]

   Dizzy flights of fancy abounded in Savonarola's discourses and took the
   place of calm and logical exposition. On the evening before he preached
   his last sermon in Advent, 1492, Savonarola beheld in the middle of the
   sky a hand holding a sword with the inscription, Behold the sword of
   the Lord will descend suddenly and quickly upon the earth--Ecce gladius
   Domini super terram cito et velociter. Suddenly the sword was turned
   toward the earth, the sky was darkened, swords, arrows and flames
   rained down. The heavens quaked with thunder and the world became a
   prey to famine and death. The vision was ended by a command to the
   preacher to make these things known. Again and again, in after years
   did he refer to this prophetic vision. [1179] Its memory was also
   preserved by a medal, representing on one side Savonarola and on the
   other a sword in the heavens held by a hand and pointing to a city
   beneath.

   The inscription on the heavenly sword well represents the style of
   Savonarola's preaching. It was impulsive, pictorial, eruptive,
   startling, not judicial and instructive. And yet it made a profound
   impression on men of different classes. Pico della Mirandola the elder
   has described its marvellous effect upon himself. On one occasion, when
   he announced as his text Gen. 6:17, "Behold I will bring the flood of
   waters upon the earth," Pico said he felt a cold shudder course through
   him, and his hair, as it were, stand on end. One is reminded of some of
   the impressions made by the sermons of Christmas Evans, the Welsh
   preacher, and the impression made by Whitefield's oratory upon Lord
   Chesterfield and Franklin. But the imagery of the sermon, brilliant and
   weird as it was, is no sufficient explanation of the Florentine
   preacher's power. The preacher himself was burning with religious
   passion. He felt deeply and he was a man of deep devotion. He had the
   eye of the mystic and saw beneath the external and ritual to the inner
   movements of spiritual power.

   The biblical element was also a conspicuous feature of his preaching.
   Defective as Savonarola's exegesis was, the biblical element was
   everywhere in control of his thought and descriptions. His famous
   discourses were upon the ark, Exodus, and the prophets Haggai, Ezekiel,
   Amos and Hosea, and John's Revelation. He insisted upon the authority
   of Scripture. "I preach the regeneration of the Church," he said,
   "taking the Scriptures as my sole guide." [1180]

   Another element which gave to Savonarola's sermons their virility and
   power was the prophetic element. Savonarola was not merely the
   expounder of righteousness. He claimed to be a prophet revealing things
   which, to use his own words, "are beyond the scope of the knowledge
   which is natural to any creature." This element would have been a sign
   of weakness, if it had not been associated with a great personality,
   bent on noble ends. The severity of his warnings was often so fearful
   that the preacher himself shrank back from delivering them. On one
   occasion, he spent the entire night in vigils and prayer that he might
   be released from the duty of making known a message, but in vain. The
   sermon, he then went forth to preach, he called a terrific sermon.

   Savonarola's confidence in his divine appointment to be the herald of
   special communications from above found expression not only from the
   pulpit but was set forth more calmly in two works, the Manual of
   Revelations, 1495, and a Dialogue concerning Truth and Prophecy, 1497.
   The latter tract with a number of Savonarola's sermons were placed on
   the Index. In the former, the author declared that for a long time he
   had by divine inspiration foretold future things but, bearing in mind
   the Saviour's words, "Give not that which is holy unto the dogs," he
   had practised reserve in such utterances. He expressed his conception
   of the office committed to him, when he said, "The Lord has put me here
   and has said to me, 'I have placed thee as a watchman in the centre of
   Italy ... that thou mayest hear my words and announce them,' " Ezek.
   3:17. If we are inclined to regard Savonarola as having made a mistake
   in claiming prophetic foresight, we easily condone the mistake on the
   ground of his impassioned fervor and the pure motives by which he was
   animated. To his prophecies he applied Christ's own words, that no jot
   or tittle should fail till they were fulfilled.

   None of his messages was more famous than the one he received on his
   visit to paradise, March, 1495. Before starting on his journey, a
   number of ladies offered to be his companions. Philosophy and Rhetoric
   he declined. Accepting the company of Faith, Simplicity, Prayer and
   Patience, he was met on his way by the devil in a monk's garb. [1181]
   Satan took occasion to present to him objections against the
   supernatural character of his predictions. Savonarola ought to have
   stopped with preaching virtue and denouncing vices and left prophecy
   alone. A prophet was always accredited by miracles. True prophets were
   holy men and the devil asked Savonarola whether he felt he had reached
   a high grade of saintliness. He then ventured to show that Savonarola's
   prophecies had not always been fulfilled. By this time they had arrived
   at the gates of paradise where prudently Satan took his leave. The
   walls of paradise--so Savonarola described them--were of diamonds and
   other precious stones. Ten banners surmounted them inscribed with the
   prayers of Florence. Hierarchies and principalities appeared on every
   side. With the help of angels, the visitor mounted a ladder to the
   throne of the Virgin who gave him a crown and a precious stone and
   then, with Jesus in her arms, supplicated the Trinity for Savonarola
   and the Florentines. Her request was granted and the Florentines
   promised an era of prosperity preceded by a period of sorrows. In this
   new time, the city would be more powerful and rich than ever before.

   The question arises whether Savonarola was a genuine prophet or whether
   he was self-deluded, mistaking for the heated imaginations of his own
   religious fervor, direct communications from God. [1182] Alexander VI.
   made Savonarola's "silly declaration of being a prophet" one of the
   charges against him. [1183] In his Manual of Revelations, Savonarola
   advanced four considerations to prove that he was a true prophet--his
   own subjective certainty, the fulfilment of his predictions, their
   result in helping on the cause of moral reform in Florence and their
   acceptance by good people in the city. His prophecies, he said, could
   not have come from astrology for he rejected it, nor from a morbid
   imagination for this was inconsistent with his extensive knowledge of
   the Scriptures, nor from Satan for Satan hated his sermons and does not
   know future events.

   For us, the only valid test is historical fact. Were Savonarola's
   prophecies fulfilled? The two prophecies, upon whose fulfilment stress
   is laid, were the political revolution in Florence, which occurred, and
   the coming of Charles VIII. from across the Alps. Savonarola saw in
   Charles a Cyrus whose advent would release Florence from her political
   bondage and introduce an era of civil freedom . He also predicted
   Charles' subsequent retreat. Commines, who visited Savonarola in the
   convent of St. Mark's after the trials which followed Charles' advent
   in Italy had begun, went away impressed with the friar's piety and
   candor, and declared that he predicted with certainty to him and to the
   king, "things which no one believed at the time and which have all been
   fulfilled since." [1184] On the other hand, such solemn
   prognostications failed of fulfilment, as the extension of Florentine
   dominion even to the recovery of Pisa, made May 28, 1495, and the
   speedy conversion of the Turks and Moors, made May 3, 1495. The latter
   purported to be a revelation from the Virgin on his visit to paradise.
   Where a certain number of solemn, prophetic announcements remained
   unfulfilled, it is fair to suspect that the remainder were merely the
   predictions of a shrewd observer watching the progress of events. Many
   people trusted the friar as a prophet but, as conditions became more
   and more involved, they demanded with increasing insistence that he
   should substantiate his prophetic claim by a miracle. Even the
   predictions which came true in part, such as the coming of Charles
   VIII. across the Alps, received no fulfilment in the way of a permanent
   improvement of conditions, such as Savonarola expected. The statement
   of Prof. Bonet-Maury expresses the case well. Savonarola's prophetic
   gift, so-called, was nothing more than political and religious
   intuition. [1185] Some of his predictions were not in the line of what
   Christian prophecies might be expected to be, such as the rehumiliation
   of Pisa. The Florentines felt flattered by the high honor which the
   prophet paid to their city, and his predictions of her earthly dominion
   as well as heavenly glory. In his Manual of Revelations he exclaims,
   "Whereas Florence is placed in the midst of Italy, like the heart in
   the midst of the body, God has chosen to select her, that she may be
   the centre from which this prophetic announcement should be spread
   abroad throughout all Italy."

   No scene in Savonarola's career excels in moral grandeur and dramatic
   interest his appearance at the death-bed of Lorenzo the Magnificent, in
   1492. History has few such scenes to offer. When it became apparent to
   the brilliant ruler of the Florentine state that his days were
   numbered, he felt unwilling to face the mysteries of death and the
   future without the absolution priestly prerogative pretends to be
   competent to confer. Savonarola and Lorenzo loved Florence with an
   equal love, though the one sought its glory through a career of
   righteousness and the other through a career of worldly dominion and
   glittering culture. The two leaders found no terms of agreement.
   Lorenzo had sought to win the preacher by personal attention and
   blandishments. He attended mass at St. Mark's. Savonarola held himself
   back as from an elegant worldling and the enemy of the liberties of
   Florence. "You see," said Lorenzo, "a stranger has come into my house,
   yet he will not stoop to pay me a visit." "He does not ask for me; let
   him go or stay at his pleasure," replied the friar to those who told
   him that Lorenzo was in the convent garden.

   Five influential citizens of Florence called and suggested to the friar
   that he modify his public utterances. Recognizing that they had come at
   Lorenzo's instance, he bade them tell the prince to do penance for his
   sins, for the Lord is no respecter of persons and spares not the mighty
   of the earth. Lorenzo called upon Fra Mariano to publicly take
   Savonarola to task. This he did from the pulpit on Ascension Day, 1491.
   Lorenzo himself was present, but the preacher's charges overshot the
   mark, and Savonarola was more popular than ever. The prior of St.
   Mark's exclaimed, "Although I am a stranger in the city, and Lorenzo
   the first man in the state, yet shall I stay here and it is he who will
   go hence."

   When the hour of death approached, Lorenzo was honest with himself. In
   vain did the physician, Lazzaro of Pavia, resort to the last medical
   measure, a potion of distilled gems. Farewell was said to Pico della
   Mirandola and other literary friends, and Lorenzo gave his final
   counsels to his son, Piero. The solemn rites of absolution and extreme
   unction were all that remained for man to receive from man. Lorenzo's
   confessor was within reach but the prince looked to St. Mark's. "I know
   of no honest friar save this one," he exclaimed. And so Savonarola was
   summoned to the bedside in the villa Careggi, two miles from the city.
   The dying man wanted to make confession of three misdeeds: the sack of
   Volterra, the robbery of Monte delle Fanciulle and the merciless
   reprisals after the Pazzi conspiracy. The spiritual messenger then
   proceeded to present three conditions on which his absolution depended.
   The first was a strong faith in God's mercy. The dying man gave assent.
   The second was that he restore his ill-gotten wealth, or charge his
   sons to do it. To this assent was also given. The third demand required
   that he give back to Florence her liberties. To this Lorenzo gave no
   response and turned his face to the wall. The priest withdrew and, in a
   few hours, April 8, 1492, the ruler of Florence passed into the
   presence of the omnipotent Judge who judgeth not according to the
   appearance but according to the heart and whose mercy is everlasting.

   The surmisal has been made that, if Savonarola had been less rigid, he
   might have exercised an incalculable influence for good upon the dying
   prince who was still susceptible of religious impressions. [1186] But
   who can with probability conjecture the secrets of the divine purpose
   in such cases? Perhaps, Savonarola's relentless demands awakened in
   Lorenzo a serious impression showing itself in a cry to God for
   absolution, while the extreme unction of the priest might have lulled
   the dying man's conscience to sleep with a false sense of security. At
   any rate, the influence of the friar of St. Mark's with the people
   increased.

   During the years, beginning with 1494, Savonarola's ascendancy was at
   its height and so cold a witness as Guicciardini reports his influence
   as extraordinary. These years included the invasion of Charles VIII.,
   the banishment of the Medici from Florence and the establishment of a
   theocratic government in the city.

   "He will come across the Alps against Italy like Cyrus," Savonarola had
   prophesied of the French king, Charles VIII. And, when the French army
   was approaching the confines of Florence, he exclaimed, "Behold, the
   sword has come upon you. The prophecies are fulfilled, the scourge
   begun! Behold these hosts are led of the Lord! O Florence, the time of
   singing and dancing is at an end. Now is the time to shed floods of
   tears for thy sins."

   Florence listened eagerly. Piero de' Medici went to the French camp and
   yielded to the king's demand for 200,000 florins, and the cession of
   Pisa, Leghorn and Sarzana. But Savonarola thundered and pled from the
   pulpit against the Medicean house. The city decreed its banishment and
   sent commissioners to Charles, with Savonarola among them. In his
   address, which is preserved, the friar reminded his Majesty that he was
   an instrument sent by the Lord to relieve Italy of its woes and to
   reform the Church. Charles entered Florence but, moved by Savonarola's
   intercession, reduced the tribute to 120,000 florins and restrained the
   depredations of the French soldiery. The king also seems to have
   listened to the friar's stern words when he said to him, "Hearken unto
   the voice of God's servant and pursue thy journey onward without
   delay."

   When Charles, after sacking Rome and occupying Naples, returned to
   Northern Italy, Savonarola wrote him five letters threatening that, if
   he did not do for Florence the things about which he had spoken to him,
   God's wrath would be poured out upon his head. These things were the
   recognition of the liberties of Florence and the return of Pisa to her
   dominion. In his letter of May 25, 1495, bidding Charles favor the city
   of Florence, he asserted, "God has chosen this city and determined to
   magnify her and raise her up and, whoso toucheth her, toucheth the
   apple of His eye." Certainly, from the standpoint of the welfare of
   Italy, the French invasion was not of Providential origin. Although the
   banners of his army were inscribed with the words Voluntas Dei -- the
   Will of God--and Missus Dei -- the legate of God--Charles was bent on
   territorial aggrandizement and not on breaking the bonds of civic
   despotism.

   The time had now come to realize in Florence Savonarola's ideal of
   government, a theocracy with Christ at its head. The expulsion of the
   Medici made possible a reorganization of the state and the new
   constitution, largely a matter of Savonarola's creation, involved him
   inextricably in civic policies and the war of civic factions. However,
   it should not be forgotten that his municipal constitution secured the
   commendation of Guicciardini and other Italian political writers. It
   was a proof of the friar's remarkable influence that, at his earnest
   advice, a law was passed which prevented retaliatory measures against
   the followers of the Medici. Landucci wrote in his diary that, but for
   Savonarola, the streets would have been bathed in blood. In his great
   sermons on Haggai, during the Advent season of 1494, and on the Psalms
   in 1495, Savonarola definitely embarked as a pilot on the political
   sea. "The Lord has driven my bark into the open ocean," he exclaimed
   from the pulpit. Remonstrating with God for imposing this duty upon
   him, he declared, 'I will preach, if so I must, but why need I meddle
   with the government of Florence.' And the Lord said, 'If thou wouldst
   make Florence a holy city, thou must establish her on firm foundations
   and give her a government which cherishes righteousness.' Thus the
   preacher was committed. He pronounced from the pulpit in favor of
   virtue as the foundation of a sound government and democracy as its
   form. "Among northern nations," he affirmed, where there is great
   strength and little intellect, and among southern nations where there
   is great intellect and little strength, the rule of a single despot may
   sometimes be the best of governments. But in Italy and, above all in
   Florence, where both strength and intellect abound,--where men have
   keen wits and restless spirits,--the government of the one can only
   result in tyranny."

   In the scheme, which he proposed, he took for his model the great
   council of Venice, leaving out its head, the doge, who was elected for
   life. The great council of Florence was to consist of, at least, 1500
   men, who had reached the age of 29, paid their taxes and belonged to
   the class called beneficiati, that is, those who held a civil office
   themselves or whose father, grandfather, or great-grandfather had held
   a civil office. A select council of 80 was to be chosen by it, its
   members to be at least forty years of age. In criminal cases, an appeal
   from a decision of the signory was allowed to the great council, which
   was to meet once a week and to be a voting rather than a deliberative
   body.

   The place of the supreme doge or ruler, Savonarola gave to God himself.
   "God alone," he exclaimed from the pulpit, "God alone will be thy king,
   O Florence, as He was king of Israel under the old Covenant." "Thy new
   head shall be Jesus Christ,"--this was the ringing cry with which he
   closed his sermons on Haggai. Savonarola's recent biographer, Villari,
   emphasizes "the masterly prudence and wisdom shown by him in all the
   fundamental laws he proposed for the new state." He had no seat in the
   council and yet he was the soul of the entire people. [1187]

   In the last chapter of his career Savonarola was pitted against
   Alexander VI. as his contestant. The conflict began with the demand
   made by the pope July 25, 1495, that Savonarola proceed to Rome and
   answer charges. Then followed papal inhibitions of his preaching and
   the decree of excommunication, and the conflict closed with the
   appointment of a papal commission which condemned Savonarola to death
   as a heretic.

   Alexander's order, summoning the friar to Rome, was based on his
   announcement that his predictions of future events came by divine
   revelation. [1188] At the same time, the pope expressed his great joy
   over the report that of all the workers in the Lord's vineyard,
   Savonarola was the most zealous, and he promised to welcome him to the
   eternal city with love and fraternal affection. Savonarola declined the
   pontiff's summons on the ground of ill-health and the dangers that
   would beset him on the way to Rome. His old rival in the pulpit, Fra
   Mariano de Gennazzano, and other enemies were in Rome intriguing
   against him, and the Medici were fast winning the pope's favor.

   Alexander's first letter inhibiting him from preaching, Sept. 9, 1495,
   condemned Savonarola's insane folly in mixing up with Italian political
   affairs and his announcement that he was a special messenger sent from
   God. In his reply Savonarola answered the charges and, at the
   invitation of the signory, continued to preach. In his third brief,
   Oct. 16, 1495, the pontiff forbade him to preach openly or in private.
   Pastor remarks, "It was as clear as the sun that Savonarola was guilty
   of rank disobedience to the papal authority." [1189]

   For five months, the friar held himself aloof in his convent but, Feb.
   17, 1496, at the call of the signory to preach the Lenten sermons, he
   again ascended the pulpit. He took the bold position that the pope
   might err. "The pope," he said, "may command me to do something that
   contravenes the law of Christian love or the Gospel. But, if he did so
   command, I would say to him, thou art no shepherd. Not the Roman
   Church, but thou errest." From that time on, he lifted his voice
   against the corruptions of the papal city as he had not done before.
   Preaching on Amos 4:1, Feb. 28, 1496, he exclaimed, "Who are the fat
   kine of Bashan on the mountains of Samaria? I say they are the
   courtesans of Italy and Rome. Or, are there none? A thousand are too
   few for Rome, 10,000, 12,000, 14,000 are too few for Rome. Prepare
   thyself, O Rome, for great will be thy punishments." [1190]

   Finding threats would not stop Savonarola's mouth, Alexander resorted
   to bribery, an art in which he was well skilled. Through a Dominican
   sent to Florence, he offered to the friar of St. Mark's the red hat.
   But Alexander had mistaken his man and, in a sermon delivered August,
   1496, Savonarola declared that neither mitres nor a cardinal's hat
   would he have, but only the gift God confers on His saints--death, a
   crimson hat, a hat reddened with blood. Lucas, strangely enough,
   ascribes the offer of the red hat, not to vicious shrewdness but to the
   alleged good purpose of Alexander to show his appreciation of, an
   earnest but misguided man."

   The carnival season of 1496 and the seasons of the next two years gave
   remarkable proofs of the hold Savonarola had on the popular mind. The
   carnival, which had been the scene of wild revelries, was turned into a
   semi-religious festival. The boys had been accustomed to carry their
   merriment to rude excesses, forcing their demands for money upon older
   persons, dancing around bonfires at night and pelting people and houses
   promiscuously with stones. For this "festival of the stones," which the
   signory had been unable to abolish Savonarola and his co-helpers
   substituted a religious celebration. It was called the reform of the
   boys. Savonarola had established boys' brigades in different wards of
   the city and arranged tiers of seats for them against the walls of the
   cathedral. These "boys of Fra Girolamo," as Landucci calls them,
   marched up and down the streets singing hymns which Savonarola and
   Benivieni composed and taking their places at stands, erected for the
   purpose, received collections for the poor.

   On the last day of the carnival of 1497, occurred the burning of the
   vanities, as it was called. The young men, who had been stirred to
   enthusiasm by Savonarola's sermons, went through the city, knocking
   from door to door and asking the people to give up their trinkets,
   obscene books such as Ovid and Boccaccio, dice, games of chance, harps,
   mirrors, masks, cosmetics and portraits of beautiful women, and other
   objects of luxury. These were piled up in the public square in a
   pyramid, 60 feet high and 240 feet in circumference at the base. The
   morning of that day, throngs listened to the mass said by Savonarola.
   The young men went in procession through the streets and reaching the
   pile of vanities, they with others joined hands and danced around the
   pile and then set fire to it amid the singing of religious songs. The
   sound of bells and trumpets added to the effect of the strange
   spectacle. Men thought of the books and philters, burnt at Ephesus
   under the spell of Paul's preaching. The scene was repeated the last
   year of Savonarola's life,1498.

   Savonarola has been charged with having no sympathy with the
   Renaissance and the charge it is not easy to set aside. As Burckhardt,
   the historian of that movement, says, he remained a monastic. In one
   writing, he sets forth the dangers of literature. Plato and Aristotle
   are in hell. And this was the judgment expressed in the city of the
   Platonic Academy! Virgil and Cicero he tolerated, but Catullus, Ovid
   and Terence he condemned to banishment. [1191]

   At one time, under the spell of the prior's preaching, all Florence
   seemed to be going to religion. Wives left their husbands and betook
   themselves to convents. Others married, taking the vow of nuptial
   abstinence and Savonarola even dreamed that the city might reach so
   perfect a condition that all marrying would cease. People took the
   communion daily and young men attended mass and received the
   eucharistic emblem. Fra Bartolomeo threw his studies of naked figures
   into the fire and for a time continued to think it sinful to use the
   hands in painting which ought to be folded continually in prayer. It
   was impossible that such a tension should continue. There was
   enthusiasm but not regeneration. A reaction was sure to come and the
   wonder is that Savonarola retained so much of the popular confidence,
   almost to the end of his life.

   Alexander would have none of the Florentine reforms and was determined
   to silence Savonarola at any cost. Within the city, the air was full of
   rumors of plots to restore the Medici and some of the conspirators were
   executed. Enemies of the republic avowed their purpose to kill
   Savonarola and circulated sheets and poems ridiculing and threatening
   him. Insulting placards were posted up against the walls of his convent
   and, on one occasion, the pulpit of the cathedral was defiled with
   ordure and draped in an ass' skin, while spikes were driven into the
   place where the preacher was accustomed to strike his hand. Landucci
   speaks of it as a "great scandal." Assassins even gathered in the
   cathedral and were only cowed by guards posted by the signory. The
   friar of St. Mark's seemed not to be appalled. It was ominous, however,
   that the signory became divided in his support.

   If possible, Savonarola became more intense in his arraignment of the
   evils of the Church. He exclaimed: "O prostrate Church, thou hast
   displayed thy foulness to the whole earth. Thou hast multiplied thy
   fornications in Italy, in France, in Spain and all other regions. Thou
   hast desecrated the sacraments with simony. Of old, priests called
   their bastards nephews, now they call them outright sons." Alexander
   could not mistake the reference nor tolerate such declamations. The
   integrity of the supreme seat of Christendom was at stake. A prophetic
   function superior to the papacy Eugenius III. might recognize, when it
   was administered in the admonitions of a St. Bernard, but the
   Florentine prophet had engaged in denunciation even to personal
   invective. The prophet was losing his balance. On May 12,1497, for "his
   failure to obey our Apostolic admonitions and commands" and as "one
   suspected of heresy" Alexander declared him excommunicate. All were
   forbidden to listen to the condemned man or have converse with him.
   [1192]

   In a letter addressed a month later "to all Christians, the elect of
   God," Savonarola again affirmed his readiness to yield to the Church's
   authority, but denied that he was bound to submit to the commands of
   his superiors when these were in conflict with charity and God's law.
   "Henceforth," exclaimed the Puritan contemporary, Landucci, "we were
   deprived of the Word of God." The signory wrote to Alexander in support
   of Savonarola, affirming his purity of character and soundness of
   doctrine, and friends, like Pico della Mirandola the younger, issued
   defences of his conduct. The elder Pico della Mirandola and Politian,
   both of whom had died a year or two before, showed their reverence for
   Savonarola by assuming the Dominican garb on their death-beds.

   At this time, Savonarola sent forth his Triumph of the Cross, in which
   were set forth the verity and reasonableness of the Catholic faith.
   [1193] After proving from pure reason God's existence and the soul's
   immortality, the work proceeds to expound the Trinity, which is above
   man's reason, and articles of the Apostles' Creed, and to set forth the
   superior excellency of the lives of Christians, on which much stress is
   laid. It closes with a confutation of Mohammedanism and other false
   forms of religion.

   Savonarola kept silence in the pulpit and refrained from the
   celebration of the sacrament until Christmas day of 1497, when he
   celebrated the mass at St. Mark's three times. On the 11th of February,
   he stood again in the pulpit of the duomo. To a vast concourse he
   represented the priest as merely an instrument of the Almighty and,
   when God withdraws His presence, prelate and pope are but as "a broken
   iron tool." "And, if a prelate commands what is contrary to godly
   living and charity, he is not only not to be obeyed but deserves to be
   anathema." On another occasion, he said that not only may the pope be
   led into error by false reports but also by his own badness, as was the
   case with Boniface VIII. who was a wicked pope, beginning his
   pontificate like a fox and ending it like a dog. [1194] Many, through
   reverence for the Church, kept away from Savonarola's preaching from
   this time on. Among these was the faithful Landucci, who says, "whether
   justly or unjustly, I was among those who did not go. I believed in
   him, but did not wish to incur risk by going to hear him, for he was
   under sentence of excommunication." Savonarola's enemies had made the
   words of Gregory the Great their war-cry, Sententia pastoris sive justa
   sive unjusta timenda est.--"The sentence of the shepherd is to be
   respected, whether it be just or unjust." [1195] His denunciations of
   the corruption prevailing in the Church became more bold. The tonsure,
   he cried, is the seat of all iniquity. It begins in Rome where the
   clergy make mock of Christ and the saints; yea, are worse than Turks
   and worse than Moors. They traffic in the sacraments. They sell
   benefices to the highest bidder. Have not the priests in Rome
   courtesans and grooms and horses and dogs? Have they not palaces full
   of tapestries and silks, of perfumes and lackeys? Seemeth it, that this
   is the Church of God?

   Every Roman priest, he said, had his concubine. No longer do they speak
   of nephews but of their sons and daughters. Savonarola even sought to
   prove from the pulpit that the papal brief of excommunication proceeded
   from the devil, inasmuch as it was hostile to godly living.

   It was becoming evident that the preacher was fighting a losing battle.
   His assaults against the morals of the clergy and the Vatican stirred
   up the powers in the Church against him; his political attitude,
   factions in Florence. His assertions, dealing more and more in
   exaggerations, were developing an expectant and at the same time a
   critical state of mind in the people which no religious teacher could
   permanently meet except through the immediate and startling
   intervention of God. He called heaven to witness that he was "ready to
   die for His God" and invited God to send him to the fires of hell, if
   his motives were not pure and his work inspired. On another occasion,
   he invoked the Lord to strike him dead on the spot, if he was not
   sincere. Landucci reports some of these wild protestations which he
   heard with his own ears.

   One weapon still remained to the pope to bring Savonarola to
   terms,--the interdict. This he threatened to fulminate over Florence,
   unless the signory sent this "son of the evil one" to Rome or cast him
   into prison. In case the first course was pursued, Alexander promised
   to treat Savonarola as a father would treat a son, provided he
   repented, for he "desired not the death of a sinner but that he might
   turn from his way and live." [1196] He urged the signory not to allow
   Savonarola to be as the fly in the milk, disturbing its relations with
   Rome or "to tolerate that pernicious worm fostered by their warmth."

   Through epistolary communications and legates, the signory continued
   its attempts to remove Alexander's objections and protect Savonarola.
   But, while all the members continued to express confidence in the
   friar's purity of motive, the majority came to take the position that
   it was more expedient to silence the preacher than to incur the pope's
   ban. At the public meeting, called by the signory March 9,1498, to
   decide the course of action to be taken, the considerations pressed
   were those of expediency. The pope, as the vicar of Christ, has his
   authority directly from God and ought to be obeyed. A second
   consideration was the financial straits of the municipality. A tenth
   was needed and this could only be ordered through the pope. Some
   proposed to leave the decision of the matter to Savonarola himself. He
   was the best man the world had seen for 200 years. Others boldly
   announced that Alexander's letters were issued through the machinations
   of enemies of Florence and the censures they contained, being unjust,
   were not to be heeded. [1197] On March 17,1498, the signory's decision
   was communicated to Savonarola that he should thenceforth refrain from
   preaching and the next day he preached his last sermon.

   In his last sermon, Savonarola acknowledged it as his duty to obey the
   mandate. A measure had been worked out in his mind which was the last
   open to a churchman. Already had he hinted from the pulpit at the
   convention of a general council as a last resort. The letters are still
   extant which he intended to send to the kings of Spain, England,
   France, Germany and Hungary, calling upon them to summon a council. In
   them, he solemnly declared that Alexander was no pope. For, aside from
   purchasing his office and from his daily sale of benefices, his
   manifest vices proved him to be no Christian. The letters seem never to
   have been received. Individuals, however, despatched preliminary
   communications to friends at the different courts to prepare the way
   for their appeal. [1198] One, addressed to Charles VIII., was
   intercepted at Milan and sent to the pope. Alexander now had
   documentary proof of the Florentine's rebellion against papal
   authority. But suddenly a wholly unexpected turn was given to the
   course of events.

   Florence was startled by the rumor that resort was to be had to ordeal
   by fire to decide the genuineness of Savonarola's claims. [1199] The
   challenge came from a Franciscan, Francesco da Puglia, in a sermon at
   S. Croce in which he arraigned the Dominican friar as a heretic and
   false prophet. In case Savonarola was not burnt, it would be a clear
   sign that Florence was to follow him. The challenge was accepted by Fra
   Domenico da Pescia, a monk of St. Mark's and close friend of
   Savonarola's, a man of acknowledged purity of life. He took his
   friend's place, holding that Savonarola should be reserved for higher
   things. Francesco da Puglia then withdrew and a Franciscan monk, Julian
   Rondinelli, reluctantly took his place. Savonarola himself disapproved
   the ordeal. It was an appeal to the miraculous. He had never performed
   a miracle nor felt the importance of one. His cause, he asserted,
   approved itself by the fruits of righteousness. But to the people, as
   the author of Romola has said, "the fiery trial seemed a short and easy
   argument" and Savonarola could not resist the popular feeling without
   forfeiting his popularity. The history of Florence could show more than
   one case of saintly men whose profession had been tested by fire. So it
   was, during the investiture controversy, with St. John Gualberti, in
   Settimo close by, and with the monk Peter in 1068, and so it was, a
   half century later, with another Peter who cleared himself of the
   charge of contemning the cross by walking unhurt over nine glowing
   ploughshares. [1200]

   The ordeal was authorized by the signory and set for April 7. It was
   decided that, in case Fra Domenico perished, Savonarola should go into
   exile within three hours. The two parties, Domenico and Rondinelli,
   filed their statements with the signory. The Dominican's included the
   following points. The Church stands in need of renovation. It will be
   chastened. Florence will be chastened. These chastisements will happen
   in our day. The sentence of excommunication against Savonarola is
   invalid. No one sins in ignoring it. [1201]

   The ordeal aroused the enthusiasm of Savonarola's friends. When he
   announced it in a sermon, many women exclaimed, "I, too, I, too." Other
   monks of St. Mark's and hundreds of young men announced their readiness
   to pass through the flames out of regard for their spiritual guide.

   Alexander VI. waited with intense interest for the last bulletins from
   Florence. His exact state of mind it is difficult to determine. He
   wrote disapproving of the ordeal and yet he could not but feel that it
   afforded an easy way of getting rid of the enemy to his authority.
   After the ordeal was over, he praised Francesco and the Franciscans in
   extravagant terms and declared the Franciscans could not have done
   anything more agreeable to him. [1202]

   The coming trial was looked for with the most intense interest. There
   was scarcely any other topic of conversation in Florence or in Rome.
   Great preparations were made. Two pyres of thorns and other wood were
   built on the public square about 60 feet in length, 3 feet wide at the
   base and 3 or 4 feet high, [1203] the wood soaked with pitch and oil.
   The distance between the pyres was two feet, just wide enough for a man
   to pass through. All entrances to the square were closed by a company
   of 300 men under Marcuccio Salviatis and two other companies of 500
   each, stationed at different points. The people began to arrive the
   night before. The windows and roofs of the adjoining houses were
   crowded with the eager spectators.

   The solemnity was set for eleven o'clock. The Dominicans made a solemn
   impression as they marched to the appointed place. Fra Domenico, in the
   van, was clothed in a fiery red velvet cope. Savonarola, clad in white
   and carrying a monstrance with the host, brought up the rear of the
   body of monks and these were followed by a great multitude of men,
   women and children, holding lighted tapers. When the hour arrived for
   the procession to start, Savonarola was preaching. He had again told
   the people that his work required no miracle and that he had ever
   sought to justify himself by the signs of righteousness and declared
   that, as on Mt. Carmel, miraculous intervention could only be expected
   in answer to prayer and humility.

   Later mediaeval history has few spectacles to offer to the eye and the
   imagination equal in interest to the spectacle offered that day. There,
   stood the greatest preacher of his time and the most exalted moral
   figure since the days of John Huss and Gerson. And there, the ancient
   method of testing innocency was once more to be tried, a novel
   spectacle, indeed, to that cultured generation of Florentines. The
   glorious pageants of Medicean times had afforded no entertainment more
   attractive.

   The crowds were waiting. The hour was past. There was a mysterious
   moving of monks in and out of the signory-palace. The whole story of
   what occurred was later told by Savonarola himself as well as by other
   eyewitnesses. The Franciscans refused to allow Fra Domenico to enter
   the burning pathway wearing his red cope or any of the other garments
   he had on, on the ground that they might be bewitched. So he was
   undressed to his skin and put on another suit. On the same ground, they
   also insisted that he keep at a distance from Savonarola. The
   impatience of the crowds increased. The Franciscans again passed into
   the signory-hall and had a long conference. They had discerned a wooden
   crucifix in Domenico's hands and insisted upon its being put away for
   fear it might also have been bewitched. Savonarola substituted the host
   but the Franciscans insisted that the host should not be carried
   through the flames. The signory was appealed to but Savonarola refused
   to yield, declaring that the accidents might be burnt like a husk but
   that the essence of the sacred wafer would remain unconsumed. Suddenly
   a storm came up and rain fell but it as suddenly stopped. The delay
   continued. The crowds were growing unruly and threatening. Nightfall
   was at hand. The signory called the ordeal off.

   Savonarola's power was gone. The spell of his name had vanished. The
   spectacle was felt to be a farce. The popular menace grew more and more
   threatening and a guard scarcely prevented violence to Savonarola's
   person, as the procession moved back to St. Mark's.

   There is much in favor of the view that on that day Savonarola's
   political enemies, the Arrabbiati, were in collusion with the
   Franciscans and that the delay on the square, occasioned by interposing
   objections, was a trick to postpone the ordeal altogether. [1204] It
   was said daggers were ready to put Savonarola out of the way. The
   populace, however, did not stop to consider such questions. Savonarola
   had not stood the test. And, it reasoned, if he was sincere and
   confident of his cause, why did he not enter the flaming pathway
   himself and brave its fiery perils. If he had not gone through
   unharmed, he at any rate, in dying, would have shown his moral heroism.
   It was Luther's readiness to stand the test at Worms which brought him
   the confidence of the people. Had he shrunk in 1521 in the presence of
   Charles V., he would have lost the popular regard as Savonarola did in
   1498 on the piazza of Florence. The judgment of modern times agrees
   with the popular judgment of the Florentines. Savonarola showed himself
   wanting in the qualities of the hero. Better for him to have died, than
   to have exposed himself to the charge of cowardice.

   Florence felt mad anger at having been imposed upon. The next day St.
   Mark's was stormed by the mob. The signory voted Savonarola's immediate
   banishment. Landucci, who wept and continued to pray for him, says
   "that hell seemed to have opened its doors." Savonarola made an
   address, bidding farewell to his friends. Resistance of the mob was in
   vain. The convent was broken into and pillaged. Fra Domenico and the
   prior were bound and taken before the galfonier amidst insults and
   confined in separate apartments. A day or two later Fra Silvestro,
   whose visions had favored the ordeal, was also seized. "As for saying a
   word in Savonarola's favor," wrote Landucci, "it was impossible. One
   would have been killed."

   The pope, on receiving the official news of the occurrences in
   Florence, sent word congratulating the signory, gave the city plenary
   absolution and granted it the coveted tithes for three years. He also
   demanded that Savonarola be sent to Rome for trial, at the same time,
   however, authorizing the city to proceed to try the three friars, not
   neglecting, if necessary, the use of torture. [1205] A commission was
   appointed to examine the prisoners. Torture was resorted to. Savonarola
   was bound to a rope drawn through a pulley and, with his hands behind
   his back, was lifted from the floor and then by a sudden jerk allowed
   to fall. On a single day, he was subjected to 14 turnings of the rope.
   There were two separate trials conducted by the municipality, April 17
   and April 21-23. In the delirious condition, to which his pains reduced
   him, the unfortunate man made confessions which, later in his sane
   moments, he recalled as untrue. [1206] He even denied that he was a
   prophet. The impression which this denial made upon such ardent
   admirers as Landucci, the apothecary, was distressing. Writing April
   19,1498, he says:--

   I was present at the reading of the proceedings against Savonarola,
   whom we all held to be a prophet. But he said he is no prophet and that
   his prophecies were not from God. When I heard that, I was seized with
   wonder and amazement. A deep pain took hold of my soul, when I saw such
   a splendid edifice fall to the ground, because it was built upon the
   sorry foundation of a falsehood. I looked for Florence to become a new
   Jerusalem whose laws and example of a good life--buona vita -- would go
   out for the renovation of the Church, the conversion of infidels and
   the comfort of the good and I felt the contrary and took for medicine
   the words, "in thy will, O Lord, are all things placed"--in voluntate
   tua, Domine, omnia sunt posita. Diary, p. 173.

   Alexander despatched a commission of his own to conduct the trial anew,
   Turriano, the Venetian general of the Dominicans and Francesco
   Romolino, the bishop of Ilerda, afterwards cardinal. Letters from Rome
   stated that the commission had instructions "to put Savonarola to
   death, even if he were another John the Baptist." Alexander was quite
   equal to such a statement. Soon after his arrival in Florence, Romolino
   announced that a bonfire was impending and that he carried the sentence
   with him ready, prepared in advance.

   Fra Domenico bore himself most admirably and persisted in speaking
   naught but praise of his friend and ecclesiastical superior. Fra
   Silvestro, yielding to the agonies of the rack, charged his master with
   all sorts of guilt. Other monks of St. Mark's wrote to Alexander,
   making charges against their prior as an impostor. So it often is with
   those who praise in times of prosperity. To save themselves, they deny
   and calumniate their benefactors. They received their reward, the papal
   absolution.

   The exact charges, upon which Savonarola was condemned to death, are
   matter of some uncertainty and also matter of indifference, for they
   were partly trumped up for the occasion. Though no offender against the
   law of God, he had given offence enough to man. He was accused by the
   papal commissioners with being a heretic and schismatic. He was no
   heretic. The most that can be said is, that he was a rebel against the
   pope's authority and went in the face of Pius II.'s bull Execrabilis,
   when he decided to appeal to a council. [1207]

   The intervals between his torture, Savonarola spent in composing his
   Meditations upon the two penitential Psalms, the 32d and the 51st. Here
   we see the gloss of his warm religious nature. The great preacher
   approaches the throne of grace as a needy sinner and begs that he who
   asks for bread may not be turned away with a stone. He appeals to the
   cases of Zaccheus, Mary Magdalene, the woman of Canaan, Peter and the
   prodigal son. Deliver me, he cries, "as Thou hast delivered countless
   sinners from the grasp of death and the gates of hell and my tongue
   shall sing aloud of thy righteousness." Luther, who published the
   expositions with a notable preface,1523, declared them "a piece of
   evangelical teaching and Christian piety. For, in them Savonarola is
   seen entering in not as a Dominican monk, trusting in his vows, the
   rules of his order, his cowl and masses and good works but clad in the
   breastplate of righteousness and armed with the shield of faith and the
   helmet of salvation, not as a member of the Order of Preachers but as
   an everyday Christian." [1208]

   At their own request the three prisoners, after a separation of six
   weeks, were permitted to meet face to face the night before the
   appointed execution. The meeting occurred in the hall of the signory.
   When Savonarola returned to his cell, he fell asleep on the lap of
   Niccolini of the fraternity of the Battuti, a fraternity whose office
   it was to minister to prisoners. Niccolini reported that the sleep was
   as quiet as the sleep of a child. On awaking, the condemned man passed
   the remaining hours of the night in devotions. The next morning, the
   friends met again and partook together of the sacrament.

   The sentence was death by hanging, after which the bodies were to be
   burnt that "the soul might be completely separated from the body." The
   execution took place on the public square where, two months before, the
   crowds had gathered to witness the ordeal by fire. Savonarola and his
   friends were led forth stripped of their robes, barefooted and with
   hands bound. Absolution was pronounced by the bishop of Verona under
   appointment from the pope. In pronouncing Savonarola's deposition, the
   prelate said, "I separate thee from the Church militant and the Church
   triumphant"--separo te ab ecclesia militante et triumphante. "Not from
   the Church triumphant," replied Savonarola, "that is not thine to
   do"--militante, non triumphante: hoc enim tuum non est. In silence he
   witnessed the deaths of Fra Domenico and Fra Silvestro, whose last
   words were "Jesus, Jesus," and then ascended the platform of execution.
   There were still left bystanders to fling insults. The bodies were
   burnt and, that no particle might be left to be used as a relic, the
   ashes were thrown into the Arno.

   Savonarola had been pronounced by Alexander's commission "that
   iniquitous monster--omnipedium nequissimum -- call him man or friar we
   cannot, a mass of the most abominable wickedness." The pious Landucci,
   in thinking of his death, recalled the crucifixion and, at the scene of
   the execution, again lamented the disappointment of his hopes for the
   renovation of the Church and the conversion of the infidel--la
   novazione della chiesa e la conversione degli infedeli.

   Savonarola was one of the most noteworthy figures Italy has produced.
   The modern Christian world, Catholic and Protestant, joins him in close
   fellowship with the flaming religious luminaries of all countries and
   all centuries. He was a preacher of righteousness and a patriot. Among
   the religious personalities of Italy, he occupies a position of
   grandeur by himself, separate from her imposing popes, like Gregory
   VII. and Innocent III.; from Dante, Italy's poet and the world's; from
   St. Francis d'Assisi and from Thomas Aquinas. Italy had other
   preachers,--Anthony of Padua, Bernardino of Siena,--but their messages
   were local and ecclesiastical. With Arnold of Brescia, Savonarola had
   something in common. Both had a stirring message of reform. Both mixed
   up political ideals with their spiritual activity and both died by
   judicial sanction of the papal see.

   Savonarola's intellectual gifts and attainments were not extraordinary.
   He was great by reason of moral conviction, his eloquence, his
   disinterested love of his country, his whole-souled devotion to the
   cause of righteousness. As an administrator, he failed. He had none of
   the sagacity or tact of the statesman and it was his misfortune to have
   undertaken to create a new government, a task for which he was the
   least qualified of all men. [1209] He was a preacher of righteousness
   and has a place in the "goodly fellowship of the prophets." He belonged
   to the order of Ezekiel and Isaiah, Nathan and John the Baptist,--the
   company in which the Protestant world also places John Knox.

   Savonarola was a true Catholic. He did not deny a single dogma of the
   mediaeval Church. But he was more deeply rooted in the fundamental
   teachings of Christ than in ecclesiastical formulas. In the deliverance
   of his message, he rose above rituals and usages. He demanded
   regeneration of heart. His revolt against the authority of the pope, in
   appealing to a council, is a serious stumbling-block to Catholics who
   are inclined to a favorable judgment of the Friar of St. Mark's. Julius
   II.'s bull Cum tanto divino,1505, pronounced every election to the
   papacy secured by simony invalid. If it was meant to be retroactive,
   then Alexander was not a true pope. [1210]

   The favorable judgments of contemporaries were numerous. Guicciardini
   called him the saviour of his country--salvatore di patria -- and said
   that "Never was there so much goodness and religion in Florence as in
   his day and, after his death, it was seen that every good thing that
   had been done was done at his suggestion and by his advocacy."
   Machiavelli thus expressed himself: "The people of Florence seemed to
   be neither illiterate nor rude, yet they were persuaded that God spake
   through Savonarola. I will not decide, whether it was so or not, for it
   is due to speak of so great a man with reverence."

   The day after Savonarola's death, women were seen praying at the spot
   where he suffered and for years flowers were strewn there. Pico della
   Mirandola closed his biography with an elaborate comparison between
   Savonarola and Christ. Both were sent from God. Both suffered in the
   cause of righteousness between two others. At the command of Julius
   II., Raphael,12 years after Savonarola's death, placed the preacher
   among the saints in his Disputa. Philip Neri and Catherine de Ricci
   [1211] revered him, and Benedict XIV. seems to have regarded him worthy
   of canonization. [1212]

   Within the Dominican order, the feeling toward its greatest preacher
   has undergone a great change. Respect for the papal decision led it,
   for a hundred years after Savonarola's death, to make official effort
   to retire his name to oblivion. The Dominican general, Sisto Fabri of
   Lucca, in 1585, issued an order forbidding every Dominican monk and nun
   mentioning his name and commanded them to give up any article to their
   superiors which kept warm admiration for him or aroused it. In the
   latter half of the 19th century, as the 400th anniversary of his
   execution approached, Catholics, and especially Dominicans, in all
   parts of the world defended his memory and efforts were made to prepare
   the way for his canonization. In the attempt to remove all objections,
   elaborate arguments have been presented to prove that Alexander's
   sentence of excommunication was in fact no excommunication at all.
   [1213] The sound and judicious Catholic historians, Hefele-Knöpfler, do
   not hesitate to pronounce his death a judicial murder. [1214]

   By the general consent of Protestants, Jerome Savonarola is numbered
   among the precursors of the Reformation,--the view taken by Ranke. He
   was not an advocate of its distinguishing tenet of justification by
   faith. The Roman church was for him the mother of all other churches
   and the pope its head. In his Triumph of the Cross, he distinctly
   asserts the seven sacraments as an appointment of Christ and that
   Christ is "wholly and essentially present in each of the eucharistic
   elements." Nevertheless, he was an innovator and his exaltation of
   divine grace accords with the teaching of the Reformation. Here all
   Protestants would have fellowship with him as when he said: [1215] --

   It is untrue that God's grace is obtained by pre-existing works of
   merit as though works and deserts were the cause of predestination. On
   the contrary, these are the result of predestination. Tell me, Peter;
   tell me, O Magdalene, wherefore are ye in paradise? Confess that not by
   your own merits have ye obtained salvation, but by the goodness of God.

   Passages abound in his Meditations like this one. "Not by their own
   deservings, O Lord, or by their own works have they been saved, lest
   any man should be able to boast, but because it seemed good in Thy
   sight." Speaking of Savonarola's Exposition of the Psalms, Luther said
   that, although some clay still stuck to Savonarola's theology, it is a
   pure and beautiful example of what is to be believed, trusted and hoped
   from God's mercy and how we come to despair of works. And the
   whole-souled German Reformer exclaimed, "Christ canonizes Savonarola
   through us even though popes and papists burst to pieces over it."
   [1216]

   The sculptor has given him a place at the feet of Luther and at the
   side of Wyclif and Huss in the monument of the Reformation at Worms.
   When Catholics, who heard that this was proposed, wrote to show the
   impropriety of including the Florentine Dominican in such company,
   Rietschel consulted Hase on the subject. The venerable Church historian
   replied, "It makes no difference whether they counted Savonarola a
   heretic or a saint, he was in either case a precursor of the
   Reformation and so Luther recognized him." [1217]

   The visitor in Florence to-day finds two invisible personalities
   meeting him everywhere, Dante, whom the city banished, and Savonarola,
   whom it executed. The spirit of theexecutioner has vanished and the
   mention of Savonarola's name strikes in all Florentines a tender chord
   of admiration and love. In 1882, the signory placed his statue in the
   Hall of the Five Hundred. There, a few yards from the place of his
   execution, he stands in his Dominican habit and cowl, with his left
   hand resting on a lion's head and holding aloft in his right hand a
   crucifix, while his clear eye is turned upwards. Again, on May 22,1901,
   the city honored the friar by setting a circular bronze tablet with
   portrait on the spot where he suffered death. A great multitude
   attended the dedication and one of the wreaths of flowers bore the name
   of the Dominicans.

   In Savonarola's cell in St. Mark's has been placed a medallion head of
   the friar, and still another on the cloistral wall over the spot where
   he was seized and made prisoner, and the visitor will often find there
   a fresh wreath of flowers, a proof of the undying memory of the
   Florentine preacher and patriot.


   This was he,

   Savonarola,--the star-look shooting from the cowl.

   [1175] The translation is from Schottmüller, pp. 2, 3. This writer
   gives two of Savonarola's letters to his mother.

   [1176] The one, the Vulgate printed in Basel, 1491, the other in
   Venice, 1492. See Luotto: Dello Studio, etc. This author draws a
   parallel between Leo XIII.'s commendation of the study of the Bible and
   Savonarola's emphasis upon it as the seat of authority.

   [1177] Sermon, March 14, 1498. Schottmüller, p. 111. Roscoe: Life of
   Lorenzo, ch. VIII., says: "The divine word from the lips of Savonarola,
   descended not amongst his audience like the dews of heaven. It was the
   piercing hail, the sweeping whirlwind, the destroying sword."

   [1178] Villari, I. 183 sqq.

   [1179] So Nov. 1, 1494, etc. See Schottmüller, p. 28 sqq. The motto,
   cito et velociter, was repeated to Savonarola by the Virgin in his
   vision of heaven, 1495.

   [1180] Rudelbach, pp. 333-346, presents an elaborate statement of
   Savonarola's attitude to the Bible, and quotes from one of his sermons
   on the Exodus thus: "The theologians of our time have soiled everything
   by their unseemly disputations as with pitch. They do not know a shred
   of the Bible, yea, they do not even know the names of its books."

   [1181] Lucas, pp. 55-61, gives a translation of the interview. Also
   Perrens, II. 167-177.

   [1182] Luotto asserts that the dilemma is presented of the genuineness
   of Savonarola's predictions or downright imposture and he boldly
   supports the former view. Pastor, Villari, Lucas and others show that
   we are not narrowed down to this dilemma.

   [1183] In his first letter to Savonarola July 21, 1495. See the text in
   O'Neil, p. 10 sqq. Savonarola's reply, p. 26 sqq.

   [1184] Villari I. 855 and Bonet-Maury, p. 232.

   [1185] This is the view of Lucas, pp. 69 sq., Pastor, Creighton, III.
   248, who pronounces "the prophetic claims a delusion," and Villari. The
   last author says, I. 362 sqq., "Is it not possible that Savonarola was
   intoxicated by the feeling that the earlier predictions had been
   fulfilled, and, as the difficulty of maintaining his position in
   Florence in the last years of his life increased, he felt forced to
   appeal more and more to this endowment as though it were real?"
   Rudelbach gives a long chapter to Savonarola's prophecies, pp. 281-333.
   Pastor discusses Savonarola's alleged prophetic gift thoroughly in his
   Gesch. d. Päpste, III. 146 sqq., and in refutation of Luotto in his Zur
   Beurtheilung

   [1186] So Pastor, III. 141. The account given of Lorenzo's interview
   with Savonarola is based upon Burlamacchi and Mirandola. Politian, in a
   letter to Jacopo Antiquario, gave a different amount of the three
   demands and made no mention of Savonarola's demand that Florence be
   restored her liberties. He also added that Savonarola left the room
   pronouncing upon the dying man a blessing. Politian's version is
   accepted by Roscoe, ch. X., Creighton, III. 296-299 and Lucas, 83 sq.
   The version given above is accepted by Villari, 168 sqq., W. Clark, p.
   116, and the rigid critic Hase, p. 20. Ranke did not see his way clear
   to deny its truth and Reumont, II. 443, who denied it in the 1st ed. of
   his Lorenzo de' Medici, hesitates in the 2d ed. Pastor proceeds upon
   the basis of its truth but expresses doubt in a note.

   [1187] One of Savonarola's propositions was to levy taxes on real
   property alone and, it seems, he was not averse to taxing Church
   property. Landucci, p. 119; Villari, I. 269, 298; II. 81.

   [1190] The Italian text in Perrens, I. 471 sq. The sermons of this
   period were on Amos, Zachariah, Micah and Ruth. According to
   Burlamacchi, the sultan had some of them translated into Turkish.

   by Villari, II. 292 sq. See also Hase, p. 59, Creighton, III. 237. Of
   the genuineness of the letters, Villari says there can be no doubt.

   [1199] Landucci's account of the fuoco, p. 165 sqq., is most vivid. For
   Cerretani's account, Schnitzer's ed., 59-71.

   [1200] See Schnitzer: Feuerprobe, p. 49 sq.

   [1201] Schnitzer, p. 54.

   [1202] Schnitzer, p. 64 sq., who goes into the matter at length, and
   Villari, II. 306 sqq., agree in the opinion that Alexander fully
   sympathized with the ordeal. They also agree that the Arrabbiati were
   largely, if not wholly, responsible for the suggestion of the ordeal
   and making it a matter of public appointment. Pastor, III. 429,
   represents Alexander as wholly disapproving the ordeal.

   [1203] There is a difference among the contemporary writers about the
   figures. Landucci, p. 168, gives the length at 50 braccia, width 10 and
   height 4; Bartolomeo Cerretaui, Schnitzer ed. p. 62, the width as 1
   braccio and the height 2.

   [1204] Schnitzer, p. 159 sq., who says the signory and the Franciscans
   joined "in packing the cards."

   [1205] Etiam per torturam. Alexander's letter in Lucas, p. 372.

   [1206] The reports of Savonarola's trial and confessions are of
   uncertain value, as they were garbled by the reporter Ser Ceccone. See
   Pastor, III. 432 sq. Landucci says that from 9 A. M. till nightfall the
   cries of Domenico and Sylvestro under the strain of torture could be
   heard in the city prison.

   [1207] See the miserable letters sent by the papal commission to
   Alexander, Lucas, pp. 434-436.

   [1208] Weimar ed. XII. 248. Twenty-three edd. of Savonarola's
   exposition appeared within two years of the author's death and, before
   half a century elapsed, it had been translated into Spanish, German,
   English and French. In Italy, it was used as a tract and put into the
   hands of prisoners condemned to death. It was embodied in the Salisbury
   Primer,1538, and in Henry VIII.'s Primer,1543.

   [1209] See the excellent remarks of Burckhardt: Renaiss., II. 200.

   [1210] Pastor, III. 436 says that Savonarola was always true to
   Catholic dogma in theory. His only departure was disobeying the pope
   and appealing to a council. Father Proctor, Pref. to Triumph of the
   Cross, p. xvii, calls Savonarola "Of Catholics the most Catholic."

   [1211] Cardinal Capecelatro in his Life of St. Ph. Neri. trsl. by
   Father Pope, I. 278, says, "Philip often read Savonarola's writings
   especially the Triumph of the Cross, and used them in the instruction
   of his spiritual children." Quoted by Proctor, Preface, p. 6. For
   Catherine de Ricci, see her Life by F. M. Capes, Lond.,1908, pp. 48,
   49, 53,270 sq. She was devoted in her cult of Savonarola and wrote a
   laud to him. This was the chief objection to her beatification in 1716,
   but the arguments for an unfavorable judgment of Savonarola were
   answered on that occasion.

   [1212] Villari, II. 417, following Schwab and other Catholic writers.
   The interpretation put upon Benedict's words is denied by Pastor:
   Beurtheilung, p. 16 sq., and Lucas.

   [1213] Father O'Neil, a Dominican, in his work, Was Savonarola really
   excommunicated? takes this position and says, p. 132, "Alexander did
   not inflict any censure on Savonarola." The fact, however, is that in
   his letters to the signory, Alexander proceeded on the basis of his
   brief of excommunication. He stated distinctly the reasons for his
   being excommunicated and he called upon the priests of Florence to
   publicly announce his sentence of May 12,1497, upon pain of drawing
   ecclesiastical censure upon themselves. O'Neil replies that a papal
   decision, based upon a false charge, is invalid, p. 175 sqq.

   [1214] Rechtlos hingemordert, Kirchengesch., p. 503. Ranke's statement
   that view making Savonarola a hero is a Dominican legend "worked out
   after the preacher's death" has been rendered untenable by the latest
   research by the eminent Savonarola scholar, the Catholic Professor
   Schnitzer. See his Feuerprobe, p. 152.

   work in 1879 to dispose of this charge and to prepare the way for
   Savonarola's canonization.

   § 77. The Study and Circulation of the Bible.

   The only biblical commentary of the Middle Ages, conforming in any
   adequate sense to our modern ideas of exegesis, was produced by Nicolas
   of Lyra, who died 1340. The exegesis of the Schoolmen was a subversion
   of Scripture rather than an exposition. In their hands, it was made the
   slave of dogma. Of grammatical and textual criticism they had no
   conception and they lacked all equipment for the grammatical study of
   the original Hebrew and Greek. What commentaries were produced in the
   flourishing era of Scholasticism, were either collections of quotations
   from the Fathers, called Chains,--catenae, the most noted of which was
   the catena on the Gospels by Thomas Aquinas,--or, if original works,
   they teemed with endless suggestions of the fancy and were like
   continents of tropical vine-growths through which it is next to
   impossible to find a clear path to Jesus Christ and the meaning of
   human life. The bulky expositions of the Psalms, Job and other biblical
   books by such theologians as Rupert of Deutz, Bonaventura and Albertus
   Magnus, are to-day intellectual curiosities or, at best, manuals from
   which piety of the conventual type may be fed. They bring out every
   other meaning but the historical and plain sense intended by the
   biblical authors. Especially true is this of the Song of Songs, which
   the Schoolmen made a hunting-ground for descriptions of the Virgin
   Mary. [1218] It is said, Thomas Aquinas was engaged on the exposition
   of this book when he died.

   The traditional mediaeval formula of interpretation reduced Tychonius'
   seven senses to four,--the literal, allegorical, moral and anagogical.
   The formula ran:--


   Litteralis gesta docet; quid credas, allegoria,

   Moralis quid agas; quo tendas anagogia.

   Thomas Aquinas, fully in accord with this method, said that "the
   literal sense of Scripture is manifold, its spiritual sense, threefold,
   viz., allegorical, moral and anagogical." [1219] The literal sense
   teaches the things which have happened, the allegorical what we are to
   believe, the moral what we are to do and the anagogical directs to
   things to be awaited. The last three senses correspond to faith, hope
   and charity. Hugo of Cher compared them to the four coverings of the
   tabernacle, the four winds, the four wings of the cherubim, the four
   rivers of paradise, the four legs of the Lord's table. Here are
   specimens: Jerusalem, literally, is a city in Palestine; allegorically,
   it is the Church; morally, the faithful soul; anagogically, the
   heavenly Jerusalem. The Exodus from Egypt is, historically, a fact;
   allegorically, the redemption of Christ; morally, the soul's
   conversion; anagogically, the departure for the heavenly land. In his
   earliest years, Dean Colet followed this method. From Savonarola we
   would expect it. The literal heaven, earth and light of Genesis 1:1,2,
   he expounded as meaning allegorically, Adam, Eve and the light of grace
   or the Hebrews, Gentiles and Jesus Christ; morally, the soul, body and
   active intelligence; anagogically, angels, men and the vision of God.
   In his later years, Colet, in answer to a letter from Erasmus, who
   insisted upon the fecundity of meanings of Scripture texts, abandoned
   his former position and declared that their fecundity consisted not in
   their giving birth to many senses but to one only and that the truest.
   [1220] In his better moods, Erasmus laid stress upon the one
   historical, sense, applying to the interpretation of the Bible the rule
   that is applied to other books.

   After the Reformation was well on its way, the old irrational method
   continued to be practised and Bishop Longland, in a sermon on Prov.
   9:1,2, preached in 1525, explained the words "she hath furnished her
   table" to mean, that wisdom had set forth in her spiritual banquet the
   four courses of history, tropology, anagogy and allegory. [1221] Three
   years later,1528, Tyndale, the translator of the English Bible, had
   this to say of the mediaeval system of exegesis and the new system
   which sought out the literal sense of Scripture: --

   The papists divide the Scripture into four senses, the literal,
   tropological, allegorical and anagogical. The literal sense has become
   nothing at all, for the pope hath taken it clean away and hath made it
   his possession. He hath partly locked it up with the false and
   counterfeited keys of his traditions, ceremonies and feigned lies. Thou
   shalt understand that the Scripture hath but one sense, which is the
   literal sense, and this literal sense is the root and ground of all and
   the anchor that never faileth whereunto, if thou cleave, thou canst
   never err or go out of the way. [1222]

   A decided step in the direction of the, new exegesis movement was made
   by Nicolas of Lyra in his Postillae, a brief commentary on the entire
   Bible. [1223] This commentator, called by Wyclif the elaborate and
   skilful annotator of Scripture,--tamen copiosus et ingeniosus
   postillator Scripturae, [1224] was born in Normandy, about 1270, and
   became professor in Paris where he remained till his death. He knew
   Greek and learned Hebrew from a rabbi and his knowledge of that tongue
   gave rise to the false rumor that he had a Jewish mother. Lyra made a
   new Latin translation, commented directly on the original text and
   ventured at times to prefer the comments of Jewish commentators to the
   comments of the Fathers. As he acknowledged in his Introduction, he was
   much influenced by the writings of Rabbi Raschi.

   Lyra's lasting merit lies in the stress he laid upon the literal sense
   which he insisted should alone be employed in establishing dogma. In
   practice, however, he allowed a secondary sense, the mystical or
   typical, but he declared that it had been put to such abuse as to have
   choked out--suffocare -- the literal sense. The language of Scripture
   must be understood in its natural sense as we would expect our words to
   be understood. [1225] His method aided in undermining the fanciful and
   pernicious exegetical system of the Schoolmen who knew neither Greek
   nor Hebrew and prepared the way for a new period of biblical
   exposition. He was used not only by Wyclif and Gerson, [1226] but also
   by Luther, who acknowledged his services in insisting upon the literal
   sense.

   Although Wyclif wrote no commentaries on books of Scripture, he gave
   expositions of the Lord's Prayer and the Decalogue and of many texts,
   which are thoroughly practical and popular. In his treatise on the
   Truth of Scripture, he seems at times to pronounce the discovery of the
   literal sense the only object of a sound exegesis. [1227] A generation
   later Gerson showed an inclination to lay stress upon the literal sense
   as fundamental but went no further than to say that it is to be
   accepted so far as it is found to be in harmony with the teachings of
   the Church. [1228]

   Later in the 15th century, the free critical spirit which the Revival
   of Letters was begetting found pioneers in the realm of exegesis in
   Laurentius Valla and Erasmus, Colet, Wesel and Wessel. As has already
   been said, Valla not only called in question the genuineness of
   Constantine's donation, but criticised Jerome's Vulgate and Augustine.
   Erasmus went still farther when he left out of his Greek New
   Testament,1516, the spurious passage about the three witnesses, 1 John
   5:7, though he restored it in the edition of 1522. He pointed out the
   discrepancy between a statement in Stephen's speech and the account in
   Genesis and questioned the authorship of the Epistle to the Hebrews,
   the Apostolic origin of 2d and 3rd John and the Johannine authorship of
   the Apocalypse.

   In opposition to such views the Sorbonne, in 1526, declared it an error
   of faith to call in question the authorship of any of the books of the
   New Testament. Erasmus recommended for the student of the Scriptures a
   fair knowledge of Latin, Greek and Hebrew and also that he be versed in
   other studies, especially the knowledge of natural objects such as the
   animals, trees, precious stones and geography of Scripture. [1229]

   The nearest approach to the exegetical principles as well as doctrinal
   positions of the Reformers was made by the Frenchman, Lefèvre
   d'Etaples, whose translations of the New Testament and the Old
   Testament carry us into the period introduced by Luther. It remained
   for Luther and the other Reformers to give to the literal or historical
   sense its due weight, and especially from the sane grammatical exegesis
   of John Calvin is a new period in the exposition of the sacred writings
   to be dated.

   The early printing-presses, from Lyons to Paris and from Venice and
   Nürnberg to Cologne and Lübeck, eagerly turned out editions of the
   entire Bible or parts of it, the vast majority of which, however, gave
   the Latin text. The first printed Latin Bible, which appeared at Mainz
   without date and in two volumes, belongs before 1455 and bears the name
   of the Gutenberg Bible from the printer or the Mazarin Bible from the
   copy which was found in the library of Cardinal Mazarin. Before 1520,
   no less than 199 printed editions of the entire volume appeared. Of
   these,156 were Latin,17 German,--3 of the German editions being in Low
   German,--11 Italian, 2 Bohemian and one Russian. [1230] Spain produced
   two editions, a Limousin version at Valencia,1478, and the
   Complutensian Bible of Cardinal Ximenes,1514-1517. England was far
   behind and her first printed English New Testament did not appear till
   1526, although Caxton had setup his printing-press at Westminster in
   1477.

   To the printed copies of the whole Scriptures must be added the parts
   which appeared in plenaria and psalteria,--copies of the Gospels and of
   the Psalms, [1231] -- and in the postillae which contained the
   Scripture text with annotations. From 1470-1520 no less than 103
   postillae appeared from the press. [1232]

   The number of copies of the Bible sent off in a single edition is a
   matter of conjecture as must also be the question whether copies were
   widely held by laymen. [1233]

   The new path which Erasmus struck out in his edition of the New
   Testament was looked upon in some quarters as a dangerous path.
   Dorpius, one of the Louvain professors, in 1515, anticipated the
   appearance of the book by remonstrating with Erasmus for his bold
   project and pronounced the received Vulgate text free "from all mixture
   of falsehood and mistake." This, he alleged, was evident from its
   acceptance by the Church in all ages and the use the Fathers had made
   of it. Another member of the Louvain faculty, Latromus, employed his
   learning in a pamphlet which maintained that a knowledge of Greek and
   Hebrew was not necessary for the scholarly study of the Scriptures. In
   England, Erasmus' New Testament was attacked on a number of grounds by
   Lee, archbishop of York; and Standish, bishop of St. Asaph, preached a
   furious sermon in St. Paul's churchyard on Erasmus' temerity in
   undertaking the issue of such a work. The University of Cologne was
   especially outraged by Erasmus' attempt and Conrad of Hersbach wrote:
   [1234] --

   They have found a language called Greek, at which we must be careful to
   be on our guard. It is the mother of all heresies. In the hands of many
   persons I see a book, which they call the New Testament. It is a book
   full of thorns and poison. As for Hebrew my brethren, it is certain
   that those who learn it will sooner or later turn Jews.

   But among the men who read Erasmus' text was Martin Luther, and he was
   studying it to settle questions which started in his soul. About one of
   these he asked his friend Spalatin to consult Erasmus, namely the final
   meaning of the righteousness of the law, which he felt the great
   scholar had misinterpreted in his annotations on the Romans in the
   Novum instrumentum. He believed, if Erasmus would read Augustine's
   works, he would change his mind. Luther preferred Augustine, as he
   said, with the knowledge of one tongue to Jerome with his knowledge of
   five.

   Down to the very end of its history, the mediaeval Church gave no
   official encouragement to the circulation of the Bible among the laity.
   On the contrary, it uniformly set itself against it. In 1199 Innocent
   III., writing to the diocese of Metz where the Scriptures were being
   used by heretics, declared that as by the old law, the beast touching
   the holy mount was to be stoned to death, so simple and uneducated men
   were not to touch the Bible or venture to preach its doctrines. [1235]
   The article of the Synod of Toulouse,1229, strictly forbidding the Old
   and New Testaments to the laity either in the original text or in the
   translation [1236] was not recalled or modified by papal or synodal
   action. Neither after nor before the invention of printing was the
   Bible a free book. Gerson was quite in line with the utterances of the
   Church, when he stated, that it was easy to give many reasons why the
   Scriptures were not to be put into the vulgar tongues except the
   historical sections and the parts teaching morals. [1237] In Spain,
   Ferdinand and Isabella represented the strict churchly view when, on
   the eve of the Reformation, they prohibited under severe penalties the
   translation of the Scriptures and the possession of copies. The
   positive enactment of the English archbishop, Arundel, at the beginning
   of the 15th century, forbidding the reading of Wyclif's English
   version, was followed by the notorious pronouncement of Archbishop
   Bertholdt of Mainz against the circulation of the German Bible, at the
   close of the same century,1485. The position taken by Wyclif that the
   Scriptures, as the sole source of authority for creed and life, should
   be freely circulated found full response in the closing years of the
   Middle Ages only in the utterances of one scholar, Erasmus, but he was
   under suspicion and always ready to submit himself to the judgment of
   the Church hierarchic. If Wyclif said, "God's law should be taught in
   that tongue that is more known, for this wit [wisdom] is God's Word,"
   Erasmus in his Paraclesis [1238] uttered the equally bold words: --

   I utterly dissent from those who are unwilling that the sacred
   Scriptures should be read by the unlearned translated into their own
   vulgar tongue, as though the strength of the Christian religion
   consisted in men's ignorance of it. The counsels of kings are much
   better kept hidden but Christ wished his mysteries to be published as
   openly as possible. I wish that even the weakest woman should read the
   Gospel and the epistles of Paul. And I wish they were translated into
   all languages, so that they might be read and understood, not only by
   Scots and Irishmen but also by Turks and Saracens, I long that the
   husbandman should sing portions of them to himself as he follows the
   plow, that the weaver should hum them to the tune of his shuttle, that
   the traveller should beguile with their stories the tedium of his
   journey.

   The utterances of Erasmus aside, the appeals made 1450-1520 for the
   circulation of the Scriptures among all classes are very sparse and, in
   spite of all pains, Catholic controversialists have been able to bring
   together only a few. And yet, the few that we have show that, at least
   in Germany and the Netherlands, there was a popular hunger for the
   Bible in the vernacular. Thus, the Preface to the German Bible, issued
   at Cologne,1480, called upon every Christian to read the Bible with
   devotion and honest purpose. Though the most learned may not exhaust
   its wisdom, nevertheless its teachings are clear and uncovered. The
   learned may read Jerome's Vulgate but the unlearned and simple folk
   could and should use the Cologne edition which was in good German. The
   devotional manual, Die Himmelsthür,--Door of Heaven,--1513, declared
   that listening to sermons ought to stir up people to read diligently in
   the German Bible. In 1505, Jacob Wimpheling spoke of the common people
   reading both Testaments in their mother-tongue and made this the ground
   of an appeal to priests not to neglect to read the Word of God
   themselves. [1239]

   Such testimonies are more than offset by warnings against the danger
   attending the popular use of Scriptures. Brant spoke strongly in this
   vein and so did Geiler of Strassburg, who asserted that putting the
   Scriptures into the hands of laymen was like putting a knife into the
   hands of children to cut bread. He added that it "was almost a wicked
   thing to print the sacred text in German." [1240] Archbishop
   Bertholdt's fulmination against German versions of the Bible and their
   circulation among the people no doubt expressed the general mind of the
   hierarchy in Germany and all Europe. [1241] In this celebrated edict,
   the German primate pronounced the German language too barbarous a
   tongue to reproduce the high thoughts expressed by Greek and Latin
   writers, writing of the Christian religion. The Scriptures are not to
   be given to simple and unlearned men and, above all, are not to be put
   into the hands of women. [1242] He spoke of the fools who were using
   the divine gift of printing to send forth things proscribed to the
   public and declared, that the printers of the sacred text were moved by
   the vain love of fame or by greed. In his zeal, the archbishop went so
   far as to forbid the translation of all works whatsoever, of Greek and
   Latin authorship, or their sale without the sanction of the doctors of
   the Universities of Mainz or Erfurt. The punishment for the violation
   of the edict was excommunication, confiscation of books and a fine of
   100 gulden.

   The decree was so effective that, after 1488, only four editions of the
   German Bible appeared until 1522, when Luther issued his New Testament,
   when the old German translations seemed to be suddenly laid aside.
   [1243] In England, Arundel's inhibition so fully expressed the mind of
   the nation that for a full century no attempt was made to translate the
   Bible into English and it was not till after 1530 that the first copy
   of the English Scriptures was published on English soil. [1244] Sir
   Thomas More, it is true, writing on the threshold of the English
   Reformation, interpreted Arundel's decree as directed against corrupt
   translations and sought to make it appear that it was on account of
   errors that Wyclif's version had been condemned. He was striving to
   parry the charge that the Church had withheld the Bible from popular
   use, but, whatever the interpretation put upon his words may be (see
   this volume, p. 348), the fact remains that the English were slow in
   getting any printed version of their own and that the Catholic party
   issued none till the close of the 16th century.

   Distinct witness is borne by Tyndale to the unwillingness of the old
   party to have the Bible in English, in these words: "Some of the
   papists say it is impossible to translate the Scriptures into English,
   some that it is not lawful for the layfolk to have it in the
   mother-tongue, some that it would make them all heretics." [1245] After
   the new views were quite prevalent in England, the English Bible had a
   hard time in winning the right to be read. Tyndale's version, for the
   printing of which he found no room in England, was at Wolsey's instance
   proscribed by Henry VIII. and the famous burning of 1527 in St. Paul's
   churchyard of all the copies Bishop Tonstall could lay his hands on
   will always rise up to rebuke those who try to make it appear that the
   circulation of the Word of God was intended by the Church authorities
   to be free. Tyndale declared that, "in burning the New Testament, the
   papists did none other thing than I looked for; no more shall they do
   if they burn me also." Any fears he may have had were realized in his
   execution at Vilvorde,1536. [1246] No doubt, the priest represented a
   large class when he rebuked Tyndale for proposing to translate the
   Bible in the words, "We were better without God's laws than the
   pope's." The martyr Hume's body was hung when an English Bible was
   found on his person. In 1543, the reading of the Scriptures was
   forbidden in England except to persons of quality. The Scotch joined
   the English authorities when the Synod of St. Andrews,1529, forbade the
   importation of Bibles into Scotland.

   In France, according to the testimony of the famous printer Robert
   Stephens, who was born in 1503, the doctors of the Sorbonne, in the
   period when he was a young man, knew about the New Testament only from
   quotations from Jerome and the Decretals. He declared that he was more
   than 50 years old before he knew anything about the New Testament.
   Luther was a man before he saw a copy of the Latin Bible. In 1533,
   Geneva forbade its citizens to read the Bible in German or French and
   ordered all translations burnt. [1247] The strict inquisition of books
   would have passed to all countries, if the hierarchy had had its way.
   In 1535, Francis I. closed the printing-presses and made it a capital
   offence in France to publish a religious book without authorization
   from the Sorbonne. The attitude of the Roman Catholic hierarchy, since
   the Reformation as well as during the Reformation, has been against the
   free circulation of the Bible. In the 19th century, one pope after
   another anathematized Bible societies. In Spain, Italy and South
   America, the punishments visited upon Bible colporteurs and the
   frequent burning of the Bible itself have been quite in the line of the
   decrees of Arundel and Bertholdt and the treatment of Bishop Tonstall.
   Nor will it be forgotten that, at the time Rome was made the capital of
   Italy in 1870, a papal law required that copies of the Bible found in
   the possession of visitors to the papal city be confiscated.

   On the other hand, through the agency of the Reformers, the book was
   made known and offered freely to all classes. What use the Reformers
   hoped to make of printing for the dissemination of religion and
   intelligence is tersely and quaintly expressed by the martyrologist,
   Foxe, in these words: [1248] --

   Either the pope must abolish printing or he must seek a new world to
   reign over, for else, as the world stands, printing will abolish him.
   The pope and all the cardinals must understand this, that through the
   light of printing the world begins now to have eyes to see and heads to
   judge .... God hath opened the press to preach, whose voice the pope is
   never able to stop with all the puissance of the triple crown. By
   printing as by the gift of tongues and as by the singular organ of the
   Holy Ghost, the doctrine of the Gospel sounds to all nations and
   countries under heaven and what God reveals to one man, is dispersed to
   many and what is known to one nation is opened to all.

   Note: - Both Janssen and Abbot Gasquet spend much pains in the attempt
   to show that the mediaeval Church was not opposed to the circulation of
   the Bible in popular versions or the Latin Vulgate. The proofs they
   bring forward must be regarded as strained and insufficient. They
   ignore entirely the vast mass of testimony on the other side, as, for
   example, the testimony involved in the popular reception given to the
   German and English Scriptures when they appeared from the hands of the
   Reformers and the mass of testimony given by the Reformers on the
   subject. Gasquet endeavors to break the force of the argument drawn
   from Arundel's edict, but he has nothing to say of the demand Wyclif
   made for the popular dissemination of the Bible, a demand which implied
   that the Bible was withheld from the people. Dr. Barry who belongs to
   the same school, in the Cambr. Mod. Hist., I. 640, speaks of "the
   enormous extent the Bible was read in the 15th century" and that it was
   not "till we come within sight of the Lutheran troubles that preachers,
   like Geiler of Kaisersberg, hint their doubts on the expediency of
   unrestrained Bible-reading in the vernacular." What is to be said of
   such an exaggeration in view of the fact that the vast majority of
   Bibles were in Latin, a language which the people could not read, that
   Geiler died in 1510, seven years before Luther ceased to be a pious
   Augustinian monk, and that he did very much more than hint doubts! He
   expressed himself unreservedly against Bible-reading.
   Janssen-Pastor,--I. 23 sqq., 72 sqq., VII. 535 sqq.--have a place for
   stray testimonies between 1480-1520 in favor of the popular reading of
   the Scriptures, but, go far as I can see, do not refer to the warnings
   of Brant, Geiler and others against their use by laymen, and the only
   reference they make to Bertholdt's notorious decree is to the clause in
   which the archbishop emphasizes the divine art of printing, divina
   quaedam ars imprimendi, I. 15.

   § 78. Popular Piety.

   During the last century of the Middle Ages, the religious life of the
   laity was stimulated by some new devices, especially in Germany. There,
   the effort to instruct the laity in the matters of the Christian faith
   was far more vital and active than in any other part of Western
   Christendom.

   The popular need found recognition in the illustrations, furnished in
   many editions of the early Bibles. The Cologne Bible of 1480, the
   Lübeck Bible of 1494 and the Venice Bible of Malermi,1497, are the best
   examples of this class of books. Fifteen of the 17 German Bibles,
   issued before the Reformation, were illustrated.

   A more distinct recognition of this need was given in the so-called
   biblia pauperum,--Bibles for the poor,--first single sheets and then
   books, containing as many as 40 or 50 pictures of biblical scenes.
   [1249] In the first instance, they seem to have been intended to aid
   priests in giving instruction. Side by side, they set scenes from the
   two Testaments, showing the prophetic types and their fulfilments. Thus
   the circumcisions of Abraham, Jacob and Christ are depicted in three
   separate pictures, the priest being represented in the very act of
   circumcising Christ. Explanations in Latin, German or French accompany
   the pictures.

   An extract will give some idea of the kind of information furnished by
   this class of literature. When Adam was dying, he sent Seth into the
   garden to get medicine. The cherub gave him a branch from the tree of
   life. When Seth returned, he found his father dead and buried. He
   planted the branch and in 4000 years it grew to be the tree on which
   the Saviour was crucified.

   The best executed of these biblical picture-books are those in
   Constance, [1250] St. Florian, Austria and in the libraries of Munich
   and Vienna. The name, biblia pauperum, may have been derived from
   Bonaventura or the statement of Gregory the Great, that pictures are
   the people's bible. In 1509, Lukas Kranach issued the passion in a
   series of pictures at Wittenberg.

   A marked and most hopeful novelty in Germany were the numerous manuals
   of devotion and religious instruction which were issued soon after the
   invention of printing. This literature bears witness to the intelligent
   interest taken in religious training, although its primary purpose was
   not for the young but to furnish a guide-book for the confessional and
   to serve priest and layman in the hour of approaching death. [1251]
   These books are, for the most part, in German, and probably had a wide
   circulation. They show common Christians what the laws of God are for
   daily life and what are the chief articles of the Church's faith. Some
   of the titles give us an idea of the intent,--The Soul's Guide, Der
   Seelenführer; Path to Heaven, Die Himmelstrasse; The Soul's Comfort,
   Der Seelentrost; The Heart's Counsellor, Der Herzmahner; The Devotional
   Bell, Das andächtige Zeitglöcklein; The Foot-Path to Eternal Bliss, Der
   Fusspfad zur ewigen Seligkeit; The Soul's Vegetable Garden, Das
   Seelenwürzgärtlein; The Soul's Vineyard, Der Weingarten der Seele; The
   Spiritual Chase, Die geistliche Jagd. Others were known by the general
   title of Beichtbüchlein--libri di penitentia -- or penitential books.

   A compendious statement of their intent is given in the title of the
   Seelenführer, [1252] namely "The Soul's Guide, a useful book for every
   Christian to practise a pious life and to reach a holy death." This
   literature deserves closer attention both because it represents
   territory hitherto largely neglected by students of the later Middle
   Ages and because it bears witness to the zeal among the German clergy
   to spread practical religion among the people. The Himmelwagen, the
   Heavenly Carriage, represents the horses as faith, love, repentance,
   patience, peace, humility and obedience. The Trinity is the driver, the
   carriage itself God's mercy.

   With variations, these little books explain the 10 Commandments, the 14
   articles of the Creed--the number into which it was then divided--the
   Lord's Prayer, the Beatitudes, mortal sins, the 5 senses, the works of
   mercy and other topics. The Soul's Comfort, which appeared in 16
   editions,1474-1523, [1253] takes up the 10 Commandments, 7 sacraments,
   8 Beatitudes, 6 works of mercy, the 7 spiritual gifts, 7 mortal sins
   and 7 cardinal virtues and "what God further thinks me worthy of
   knowing." Most useful as this little book was adapted to be, it
   sometimes states truth under strange forms, as when it tells of a man
   whose soul after death was found, not in his body but in his
   money-chest and of a girl who, while dancing on Friday, was violently
   struck by the devil but recovered on giving her promise to amend her
   ways.

   The Path to Heaven contains 52 chapters. The first two set forth faith
   and hope, the joys of the elect and the pains of the lost and it closes
   with 4 chapters describing a holy death, the devil's modes of tempting
   the dying and questions which are to be put to sick people. Dietrich
   Kolde's Mirror of a Christian Man, one of the most popular of the
   manuals, in the first two of its 46 chapters, took up the Apostles'
   Creed and, in the last, the marks of a good Christian man. The first
   edition appeared before 1476; the 23d at Delfft,1518. [1254]

   Many of the manuals expressly set forth the value of the family
   religion and call upon parents to teach their children the Creed, the
   10 Commandments, the Lord's Prayer, to have them pray morning and
   evening and to take them to church to hear the mass and preaching. The
   Soul's Guide says, "The Christian home should be the first school for
   young children and their first church."

   The Path to Heaven, [1255] written by Stephen von Landskron or
   Lanzkranna, dean of Vienna, d. 1477, presents a very attractive picture
   of a Christian household. As a model for imitation, the head of a
   family is represented as going to church with his wife, children and
   servants every Sunday and listening to the preaching. On returning
   home, he reviews the subject of the sermon and hears them recite the
   Commandments, Lord's Prayer and Creed and the 7 mortal sins. Then,
   after he has refreshed himself with a draught, Trinklein, they sing a
   song to God or Mary or to one of the saints. The Soul's Comfort
   counsels parents to examine their households about the articles of
   faith and the precepts the children had learned at school and at
   church. The Table of a Christian Life [1256] urges the parents to keep
   their children off the streets, send them to school, making a selection
   of their teachers and, above all, to live well themselves and "go
   before" their children in the practice of all the virtues.

   Of the penitential books, designed distinctly as manuals of preparation
   for the confessional, the work of John Wolff is the most elaborate and
   noteworthy. This good man, who was chaplain at St. Peter's, Frankfurt,
   wrote his book 1478. [1257] He was deeply interested in the impartation
   of religious instruction. His tombstone, which was unearthed in 1895,
   calls him the "doctor of the 10 Commandments" and gives a
   representation of the 10 Commandments in 10 pictures, each Commandment
   being designated by a hand with one or more fingers uplifted. Such
   tables it was not an uncommon thing, in the last years of the Middle
   Ages, to hang on the walls of churches.

   Wolff's book, which is a guide for daily Christian living, sets forth
   at length the 10 Commandments and the acts and inward thoughts which
   are in violation of them, and puts into the mouth of the offender an
   appropriate confession. Thus, confessing to a violation of the 4th
   Commandment, the offender says, "I have done on Friday rough work, in
   farming, dunging the fields, splitting wood, spinning, sewing, buying
   and selling, dancing, striking people at the dance, playing games and
   doing other sinful things. I did not hear mass or preaching and was
   remiss in the service of Almighty God." Upon the exposition of the
   Decalogue follow lists of the five baser sins,--usury, killing,
   stealing, sodomy and keeping back wages,--the 6 sins against the Holy
   Ghost, the 7 works of mercy such as visiting the sick, clothing the
   naked and burying the dead, the sacraments, the Beatitudes, the 7 gifts
   of the Holy Ghost and an exposition of repentance. The work closes with
   a summary of the advantages to be derived from the frequent repetition
   of the 10 Commandments and mentions 13 excuses, given for not repeating
   them, such as that the words are hard to remember and the unwillingness
   to have them as a perpetual monitor.

   These manuals, having in view the careful instruction of adults and
   children, indicate a new era in the history of religious training. No
   catechisms have come down to us from the ancient Church. The
   catechumens to whom Augustine and Cyril addressed their catechetical
   discourses were adults. In the 13th century, synods began to call for
   the preparation of summaries of religious knowledge for laymen. So a
   synod at Lambeth,1281, Prag,1355, and Lavaur, France,1368. The Synod of
   Tortosa,1429, ordered its prelates to secure the preparation of a brief
   compendium containing in concise paragraphs all that it was necessary
   for the people to know and that might be explained to them every Sunday
   during the year by their pastors. Gerson approached the catechetical
   method (see this volume, p. 216 sq.) and, after long years of activity
   made the statement that the reformation of the church must begin with
   children, a parvulis ecclesiae reparatio et ejus cultura incipienda.
   [1258] In his Tripartite work he presents the Ten Commandments,
   confession and thoughts for the dying. The catechetical form of
   question and answer was not adopted till after the Lutheran Reformation
   was well on its way. The term, catechism, as a designation of such a
   manual was first used by Luther,1525, and the first book to bear the
   title was Andreas Althammer's Catechism, which appeared in 1528.
   Luther's two catechisms were issued one year later. The first Catholic
   book to bear the title was prepared by George Wicelius,1535.

   In England, we have something similar to the German penitential books
   in the Prymers, [1259] the first copy of which dates from 1410. They
   were circulated in Latin and English, and were intended for the
   instruction of the laity. They contained the calendar, the Hours of our
   Lady, the litany, the Lord's Prayer, Creed, Ten Commandments, 7
   Penitential Psalms, the 7 deadly sins, prayers and other matters. The
   book is referred to by Piers Plowman, and frequently in the 15th
   century, as one well known. [1260] The Horn-book also deserves mention.
   This device for teaching the alphabet and the Lord's Prayer consisted
   of a rectangular board with a handle, to be held like a modern
   hand-mirror. On one or both sides were cut or printed the letters of
   the alphabet and the Lord's Prayer. Horn-books were probably not in
   general use till the close of the 16th century, but they date back to
   the middle of the 15th. They probably got their name from a piece of
   animal horn with which the face of the written matter was covered as a
   protection against grubby fingers. [1261]

   A nearer approach to the catechetical idea was made by Colet in his
   rudiments of religious knowledge appended to his elementary grammar,
   and intended for use in St. Paul's School. It contains the Apostles'
   Creed, the Lord's Prayer, an exposition of the love due God and our
   fellowmen, 46 special "precepts of living," and two prayers, and is
   generally known as the Catecheyzon. [1262]

   Religious instruction was also given through the series of pictures
   known as the Dance of Death, and through the miracle plays. [1263] In
   the Dance of Death, a perpetual memento mori, death was represented in
   the figure of a skeleton appearing to persons in every avocation of
   life and of every class. None were too holy or too powerful to evade
   his intrusion and none too humble to be beyond his notice. Death wears
   now a serious, now a comic aspect, now politely leads his victim, now
   walks arm in arm with him, now drags him or beats him. An hour-glass is
   usually found somewhere in the pictures, grimly reminding the onlooker
   that the time of life is certain to run out. These pictures were
   painted on bridges, houses, church windows and convent walls. Among the
   oldest specimens are those in Minden,1383, at Paris in the churchyard
   of the Franciscans,1425, Dijon,1436, Basel,1441, Croyden, the Tower of
   London, Salisbury Cathedral,1460, Lübeck,1463. [1264]

   In the fifteenth century, the religious drama was in its bloom in
   Germany and England. [1265] The acting was now turned over to laymen
   and the public squares and streets were preferred for the performances.
   The people looked on from the houses as well as from the streets. In
   1412, while the play of St. Dorothea was being acted in the
   market-place at Bautzen, the roof of one of the houses fell and 33
   persons were killed. The introduction of buffoonery and farce had
   become a recognized feature and lightened the impression without
   impairing the religious usefulness of the plays. The devil was made a
   subject of perpetual jest and fun. The people found in them an element
   of instruction which, perhaps, the priest did not impart. The scenes
   enacted reached from the Creation and the fall of Lucifer to the Last
   Judgment and from Abel's death and Isaac's sacrifice to the crucifixion
   and resurrection.

   Set forth by living actors, the miracle plays and moralities were to
   the Middle Ages what the Pilgrim's Progress was to Puritans. They were
   performed from Rome to London, at the marriage and visits of princes
   and for the delectation of the people. We find them presented before
   Sigismund and prelates during the solemn discussions of the Council of
   Constance, as when the play of the Nativity and the Slaughter of the
   Innocents was acted at the Bishop of Salisbury's lodgings,1417, and at
   St. Peter's, as when the play of Susannah and the Elders was performed
   in honor of Leonora, daughter of Ferrante of Naples,1473. At a popular
   dramatization of the parable of the 10 Virgins in Eisenach,1324, the
   margrave, Friedrich, was so moved by the pleas of the 5 foolish maidens
   and the failure to secure the aid of Mary and the saints, that he cried
   out, "What is the Christian religion worth, if sinners cannot obtain
   mercy through the intercession of Mary?" The story went, that he became
   melancholy and died soon afterwards.

   Of the four English cycles of miracle plays, York, Chester, Coventry
   and Towneley or Wakefield, the York cycle dates back to 1360 and
   contained from 48 to 57 plays. Chester and Coventry were the
   traditional centres of the religious drama. The stage or pageant, as it
   was called, was wheeled through the streets. The playing was often in
   the hands of the guilds, such as the barbers, tanners, plasterers,
   butchers, spicers, chandlers. [1266] The paying of actors dates from
   the 14th century.

   Chester cycles was Noah's Flood, a subject popular everywhere in
   mediaeval Europe. After God's announcement to the patriarch, his 3 sons
   and their wives offered to take hand in the building of the ark. Noah's
   wife alone held out and scolded while the others worked. In spite of
   Noah's well-known quality of patience, her husband exclaimed: --


   Lord, these women be crabbed, aye

   And none are meke, I dare well says.

   Nothing daunted, however, the patriarch went on with his hammering and
   hewing and remarked: --


   These bordes heare I pinne togither

   To bear us saffe from the weither,

   That we may rowe both heither and theither

   And saffe be from the fludde. [1267]

   The ark finished, each party brought his portion of animals and birds.
   But when they were housed, Noah's help-meet again proved a disturbing
   element. Noah bade Shem go and fetch her.


   Sem, sonne, loe! thy mother is wrawe (angry).

   Shem told her they were about to set sail, but still she resisted
   entreaty and all hands were called to join together and "fetch her in."

   One of the best of the English plays, Everyman, has for its subject the
   inevitableness of death and the judgment. [1268] God sends Death to
   Everyman and, in his attempt to withstand his message, Everyman calls
   upon his friends Fellowship, Riches, Strength, Beauty and Good Works
   for help or, at least, to accompany him on his pilgrimage. This with
   one consent they refused to do. He then betook himself to Penance, and
   has explained to him the powers of the priesthood: --


   God hath to priest more power given

   Than to any angel that is in heaven.

   With five words, he may consecrate

   God's body in flesh and blood to take

   And handleth his Maker between his hands:

   The priest bindeth and unbindeth all bands

   Both in earth and in heaven,

   He ministers all the sacraments seven.

   Such plays were impressive sermons, a popular summer-school of moral
   and religious instruction, the mediaeval Chatauqua. They continued to
   be performed in England till the 16th century and even till the reign
   of James I., when the modern drama took their place. The last survival
   of the religious drama of the Middle Ages is the Passion Play given at
   Oberammergau in the highlands of Bavaria. In obedience to a vow, made
   during a severe epidemic in 1684, it has been acted every ten years
   since and more often in recent years. Since 1860, the performances have
   attracted throngs of spectators from foreign lands, a performance being
   set for 1910. Writers have described it as a most impressive sermon on
   the most momentous of scenes, as it is a solemn act of worship for the
   simple-hearted, pious Catholics of that remote mountain village.

   Pilgrimages and the worship of relics were as popular in the 16th
   century as they had been in previous periods of the Middle Ages. [1269]
   Guide-books for pilgrims were circulated in Germany and England and
   contained vocabularies as well as items of geography and other details.
   [1270] Jerusalem continued to attract the feet of princes and prelates
   as well as persons of less exalted estate. Frederick the Wise of
   Saxony, Luther's cautious but firm friend, was one of these pilgrims in
   the last days of the Middle Ages. William Wey of England, who in 1458
   and 1462, went to the Holy Land, tells us how the pilgrims sang "O city
   dear Jerusalem," Urbs beata, as they landed at Joppa. Sir Richard
   Torkington and Sir Thomas Tappe, both ecclesiastics, made the journey
   the same year that Luther nailed up the Theses,1517. The journeys to
   Rome during the Jubilee Years of 1450,1500, drew vast throngs of
   people, eager to see the holy city and concerned to secure the
   religious benefits promised by the supreme pontiff. Local shrines also
   attracted constant streams of pilgrims.

   Among the popular shrines in Germany were the holy blood at Stemberg
   from 1492, the image of Mary at Grimmenthal from 1499, as a cure for
   the French sickness, the head of St. Anna at Düren from 1500, this
   relic having been stolen from Mainz. The holy coat of Treves was
   brought to light in 1512. As in the flourishing days of the Crusades,
   so again, pilgrimage-epidemics broke out among the children of Germany,
   as in 1457 when large bands went to St. Michael's in Normandy and in
   1475 to Wilsnack, where, in spite of the exposure by Nicolas of Cusa,
   the blood was still reputed holy. [1271] The most noted places of
   pilgrimage in Germany were Cologne with the bodies of the three
   Magi-kings and Aachen, where Mary's undergarment, Jesus'
   swaddling-cloth and the loin-cloth he wore on the cross and other
   priceless relics are kept. Some idea of the popularity of pilgrimages
   may be had from the numbers that are given, though it is possible they
   are exaggerated. In 1466, 130,000 attended the festival of the angels
   at Einsiedeln, Switzerland, and in 1496 the porter at the gate of
   Aachen counted 146,000. [1272] In the 14 days, when the relics were
   displayed, 85,000 gulden were left in the money-boxes of St. Mary's,
   Aachen.

   Imposing religious processions were also popular, such as the
   procession at Erfurt,1483, in a time of drought. It lasted from 5 in
   the morning till noon, the ranks passing from church to church. Among
   those who took part were 948 children from the schools, the entire
   university-body comprising 2,141 persons, 812 secular priests, the
   monks of 5 convents and a company of 2,316 maidens with their hair
   hanging loosely down their backs and carrying tapers in their hands.
   German synods called attention to the abuses of the pilgrimage-habit
   and sought to check it. [1273]

   English pilgrims, not satisfied with going to Rome, Jerusalem and the
   sacred places on their own island, also turned their footsteps to the
   tomb of St. James of Compostella, Spain. In 1456, Wey conducted 7
   ship-loads of pilgrims to this Spanish locality. Among the popular
   English shrines were St. Edmund of Bury, St. Ethelred of Ely, the holy
   hood of Boxley, the holy blood of Hailes and, more popular than all,
   Thomas à Becket's tomb at Canterbury and our Blessed Lady of
   Walsingham. So much frequented was the road to Walsingham that it was
   said, Providence set the milky way in the place it occupies in the
   heavens that it might shine directly upon it and direct the devout to
   the sacred spot. These two shrines were visited by unbroken processions
   of religious itinerants, including kings and queens as well as people
   less distinguished. Reference has already been made to Erasmus'
   description, which he gives in his Colloquies. At Walsingham, he was
   shown the Virgin's shrine rich with jewels and ornaments of silver and
   gold and lit up by burning candles. There, was the wicket at which the
   pilgrim had to stoop to pass but through which, with the Virgin's aid,
   an armed knight on horseback had escaped from his pursuer. The Virgin's
   congealed milk, the cool scholar has described with particular
   precision. Asking what good reason there was for believing it was
   genuine, the verger replied by pointing him to an authentic record hung
   high up on the wall. Walsingham was also fortunate enough to possess
   the middle joint of one of Peter's fingers.

   At Canterbury, Erasmus and Colet looked upon Becket's skull covered
   with a silver case except at the spot where the fatal dagger pierced it
   and Colet, remarking that Thomas was good to the poor while on earth,
   queried whether now being in heaven he would not be glad to have the
   treasures, stored in his tomb, distributed in alms. When a chest was
   opened and the monk held up the rags with which the archbishop had
   blown his nose, Colet held them only a moment in his fingers and let
   them drop in disgust. It was said by Thomas à Kempis, that rarely are
   they sanctified who jaunt about much on pilgrimages--raro
   sanctificantur, qui multum peregrinantur. [1274] One of the German
   penitential books exclaimed, "Alas! how seldom do people go on
   pilgrimages from right motives." Twenty-five years after the visits of
   Erasmus and Colet, the canons of Walsingham, convicted of forging
   relics, were dragged by the king's order to Chelsea and burnt and the
   tomb of St. Thomas was rifled of its contents and broken up.

   Saints continued to be in high favor. Every saint has his distinct
   office allotted to him, said Erasmus playfully. One is appealed to for
   the toothache, a second to grant easy delivery in childbirth, a third
   to lend aid on long journeys, a fourth to protect the farmer's live
   stock. People prayed to St. Christopher every morning to be kept from
   death during the day, to St. Roche to be kept from contagion and to St.
   George and St. Barbara to be kept from falling into the hands of
   enemies. He suggested that these fabulous saints were more prayed to
   than Peter and Paul and perhaps than Christ himself. [1275] Sir Thomas
   More, in his defence of the worship of saints, expressed his
   astonishment at the "madness of the heretics that barked against the
   custom of Christ's Church."

   The encouragement, given at Rome to the worship of relics, had a signal
   illustration in the distinguished reception accorded the head of St.
   Andrew by the Renaissance pope, Pius II. In Germany, princes joined
   with prelates in making collections of sacred bones and other objects
   in which miraculous virtue was supposed to reside and whose worship was
   often rewarded by the almost infinite grace of indulgence. In Germany,
   in the 15th century as in Chaucer's day in England, the friars were the
   indefatigable purveyors of this sort of merchandise, from the bones of
   Balaam's ass to the straw of the manger and feathers from St. Michael's
   wings. The Nürnberger, Nicolas Muffel, regretted that, after the effort
   of 33 years, he had only been able to bring together 308 specimens.
   Unfortunately this did not keep him from the crime of theft and the
   penalty of the gallows. [1276] In Vienna, were shown such rarities as a
   piece of the ark, drops of sweat from Gethsemane and some of the
   incense offered by the Wise Men from the East. Albrecht, archbishop of
   Mainz, helped to collect no less than 8,138 sacred fragments and 42
   entire bodies of saints. This collection, which was deposited at Halle,
   contained the host--that is, Christ's own body--which Christ offered
   while he was in the tomb, a statue of the Virgin with a full bottle of
   her milk hanging from her neck, several of the pots which had been used
   at Cana and a portion of the wine Jesus made, as well as some of the
   veritable manna which the Hebrews had picked up in the desert, and some
   of the earth from a field in Damascus from which God made Adam.

   A most remarkable collection was made by no less a personage than
   Frederick the Wise of Saxony. [1277] A rich description of its
   treasures has been preserved from the hand of Andreas Meinhard, then a
   new master of arts. On his way to Wittenberg,1507, he met a raw student
   about to enter the university, Reinhard by name. The elector had made
   good use of the opportunities his pilgrimages to Jerusalem furnished
   and succeeded in obtaining the very respectable number of 5,005 sacred
   pieces. The collection was displayed for over a year in the
   Schlosskirche, where Meinhard and his travelling companion looked at it
   with wondering eyes and undoubting confidence. Among the pieces were a
   thorn from the crown of thorns, a tunic belonging to John the
   Evangelist, milk from the Virgin's breast, a piece of Mt. Calvary, a
   piece of the table on which the Last Supper was eaten, fragments of the
   stones on which Christ stood when he wept over Jerusalem and as he was
   about to ascend to heaven, the entire body of one of the Bethlehem
   Innocents, one of the fingers of St. Anna, "the most blessed of
   grandmothers,"--beatissimae aviae,--pieces of the rods of Aaron and
   Moses, a piece of Mary's girdle and some of the straw from the
   Bethlehem manger. Good reason had Meinhard to remark that, if the
   grandfathers had been able to arise from the dead, they would have
   thought Rome itself transferred to Wittenberg. Each of these fragments
   was worth 100 days of indulgence to the worshipper. The credulity of
   Frederick, the collector, and the people betrays the atmosphere in
   which Luther was brought up and the struggle it must have cost him to
   attack the deep-seated beliefs of his generation.

   The religious reverence paid to the Virgin could not well go beyond the
   stage it reached in the age of the greater Schoolmen nor could more
   flattering epithets be heaped upon her than were found in the works of
   Albertus Magnus and Bonaventura. Mary was more easily entreated than
   her Son. The Horticulus animae,--Garden of the Soul,--tells the story
   of a cleric, accustomed to say his Ave Marias devoutly every day, to
   whom the Lord appeared and said, that his mother was much gratified at
   the priest's prayers and loved him much but that he should not forget
   also to direct prayers to himself. The book, Heavenly Wagon, called
   upon sinners to take refuge in her mantle, where full mercy and pardon
   would be found. [1278] Erasmus remarked that Mary's blind devotees,
   praying to her on all occasions, considered it manners to place the
   mother before the Son. [1279] In 1456, Calixtus III. commended the use
   of the Ave Maria as a protection against the Turks. English Prymers
   contained the salutations,

   Blessid art thou virgyn marie, that hast born the lord maker of the
   world: thou hast getyn hym that made thee, and thou dwellist virgyne
   withouten ende. Thankis to god.

   Heil sterre of the see, hooli goddis modir, alwei maide, blesful gate
   of heuene. [1280]

   The doctrine of the Immaculate Conception in its extreme form,
   exempting Mary from the beginning from all taint of original sin, was
   defined by the Council of Basel [1281] but the decision has no
   oecumenical authority. Sixtus IV.,1477 and 1483, declared the
   definition of the dogma still an open question, the Holy See not having
   pronounced upon the subject. But the University of Paris,1497, in
   emphatic terms decided for the doctrine and bound its members to the
   tenet by an oath. Erasmus, comparing the subtlety of the Schoolmen with
   the writings of the Apostles, observed that, while the former hotly
   contended over the Immaculate Conception, the Apostles who knew Mary
   well never undertook to prove that she was immune from original sin.
   [1282]

   To the worship of Mary was added the worship of Anna, Mary's reputed
   mother. The names of Mary's parents, Anna and Joachim, were received
   from the Apocryphal Gospels of James and the Infancy. Jerome and
   Augustine had treated the information with suspicion as also the
   further information that the couple were married in Bethlehem and lived
   in Nazareth, had angelic announcements of the birth of Mary and that,
   upon Joachim's death, Anna married a second and a third time. The
   Crusaders brought relics of her with them to Western Europe and
   gradually her claim found recognition. Her cult spread rapidly. In
   Alexander VI. she found a distinguished devotee. Churches and hospitals
   were built to her memory. Trithemius wrote a volume in her praise and
   artists, like Albrecht Dürer, joined her with Mary on the canvas.
   [1283] She was claimed as a patron saint by women in childbirth and by
   the copper miners. Luther himself was one of her ardent worshippers.
   Both Albrecht of Mainz and Frederick the Wise were fortunate enough to
   have in their collections of relics, each, one of the fingers of the
   saint. [1284]

   If sacred poetry is any test of the devotion paid to a saint, then the
   Virgin Mary was far and away the chief personage to whom worshippers in
   the last centuries of the Middle Ages looked for help. The splendid
   collection issued by Blume and Dreves,--Analecta hymnica,--filling now
   nearly 8,000 pages, gives the material from which a judgment can be
   formed as to the relative amount of attention writers of hymns and
   sequences paid to the Godhead, to Mary and to the other saints. Number
   XLII., containing 336 hymns, gives 37 addressed to Christ,110 to Mary
   and 189 to other saints. Number XLVI. devotes 102 to Mary. These
   numbers are taken at random. Here are introductory verses from several
   of the thousands of hymns which were composed in praise of her virtues
   and the efficacy of her intercession:--


   Pulchra regis regia

   Regens regentem omnia [1285]


   Sal deitatis cella

   Virgo virginum

   Maria, nostra consolatrix. [1286]


   Materaltissimi regis

   Tu humani altrix gregis

   Advocata potissima

   In hora mortis ultima. [1287]

   Anna also has a large place in the hymns of the later Middle Ages and
   the 16th century. [1288] Here are the opening verses of two of them:


   Dulcis Jesu matris pater

   Joachim, et Anna mater

   Justi, natu nobiles. [1289]


   Gaude, mater Anna

   Gaude, mater sancta

   Cum sis Dei facta

   Genetrix avia. [1290]

   In England, singing sacred songs seems to have been little cultivated
   before the 16th century. The singing of Psalms in the days of Anne
   Boleyn was a novelty and was greatly enjoyed at the court as it was
   later in Elizabeth's reign, on the streets. The vast numbers of sacred
   pieces, written in Germany, France and the Lowlands, were intended for
   conventual devotions not for popular use. [1291] Singing, however, was
   practised extensively in pilgrimages and processions and also in
   churches, and the Basel synod at its 21st session complained that the
   public services were interrupted by hymns in the vernacular. Germany
   took the lead in sacred popular music. From 1470-1520, nearly 100 hymns
   were printed from German presses, many of them with original tunes.
   Sometimes the hymns were in German from beginning to end, sometimes
   they were a mixture of Latin and German. As the Middle Ages drew to a
   close, religious song increased. The Reformation established
   congregational singing and begat the congregational hymnbook. [1292]

   These adjuncts and elements of Christian worship and training were
   added to the usual service of the churches, the celebration of the
   mass, which was central, the confessional and preaching. The age was
   religious but doubt was growing. A writer of the 16th century says of
   England: [1293]

   There are many who have various opinions concerning religion but all
   attend mass every day and say many pater nosters in public, the women
   carrying long rosaries in their hands and any who can read taking the
   Hours of our Lady with them and reciting them in church verse by verse
   in a low voice is the manner of the religious. They always hear mass in
   their parish church on Sunday and give liberal alms nor do they omit
   any form incumbent upon good Christians.

   The age of a more intelligent piety was still to come, though it was to
   prove itself less submissive to human authority.

   § 79. Works of Charity.

   Benevolence and philanthropy, which are of the very essence of the
   Christian religion, flourished in the later Middle Ages. In the
   endeavor to provoke his generation to good works, Luther asserted that
   "in the good old papal times everybody was merciful and kind. Then it
   snowed endowments and legacies and hospitals." [1294] Institutions were
   established to care for the destitute and sick, colleges and bursaries
   were endowed and protection given to the dependent against the rapacity
   of unscrupulous money-lenders.

   The modern notion of stamping out sickness by processes of sanitation
   scarcely occurred to the mediaeval municipalities. Although the
   population of Europe was not 1/10 of what it is to-day, disease was
   fearfully prevalent. No epidemics so fatal as the Black Death appeared
   in Europe but, even in England, the return of plagues was frequent, as
   in 1406,1439,1464,1477. The famine of 1438, called the Great Famine,
   was followed the next year by the Great Pestilence, called also the
   pestilence sans merci. In 1464, to follow the Chronicle of Croyland,
   thousands, "died like slaughtered sheep." The sweating sickness of 1485
   reappeared in 1499 and 1504. In the first epidemic, 20,000 died in
   London and, in 1504, the mayor of the city succumbed. The disease took
   people suddenly and was marked by a chill, which was followed by a
   fiery redness of the skin and agonizing thirst that led the victims to
   drink immoderately. Drinking was succeeded by sweating from every pore.
   [1295]

   Provision was made for the sick and needy through the monasteries,
   gilds and brotherhoods as well as by individual assistance and state
   collections. The care of the poor was in England regarded as one of the
   primary functions of the Church. Archbishop Stratford,1342, ordered
   that a portion of the tithe should be invariably set apart for their
   needs. The neglect of the poor was alleged as one of the crying
   omissions of the alien clergy.

   Doles for the poor, a common form of charity in England, were often
   provided for on a large scale. During the 40 days the duke of Gaunt's
   body was to remain unburied, 50 marks were to be distributed daily
   until the 40th day, when the amount was to be increased to 500 marks.
   Bishop Skirland wanted 200 given away between his death and his
   interment. A draper of York gave by will 100 beds with furniture to as
   many poor folk. A cloth-maker made a doubtful charity when he left a
   suit of his own make to 13 poor people, with the condition that they
   should sit around his coffin for 8 days. There were houses, says
   Thorold Rogers, where doles of bread and beer were given to all
   wayfarers, houses where the sick were treated, clothed and fed,
   particularly the lepers. One of the hospitals that survives is St. Crow
   at Winchester for old and indigent people. [1296] The cook Ketel, a
   Brother of the Common Life, whose biography Thomas à Kempis wrote, said
   it would be better to sell all the books of the house at Deventer and
   give more to the poor.

   Hospitals, in the earlier part of our period, were the special concern
   of the knights of the Teutonic Order and continued throughout the whole
   of it to engage the attention of the Beguines. It became the custom
   also for the Beguines to go as nurses to private houses as in Cologne,
   Frankfurt, Treves, Ulm and other German cities, receiving pay for their
   services. [1297] The Beguinages in Bruges, Ghent, Antwerp andother
   cities of Belgium and Holland date back to this period. The 15th
   century also witnessed the growth of municipal hospitals, a product of
   the civic spirit which had developed in North-Europe. Cities like
   Cologne, Lübeck and Augsburg had several hospitals. The Hotel de Dieu,
   Paris, did not come under municipal control till 1505. In cases,
   admission to hospitals was made by their founders conditional on
   ability to say the Lord's Prayer, the Creed and the Ave Maria, as for
   example to St. Anthony's, Augsburg. In this case, the founder took care
   to provide for himself, requiring the inmates on entering to say 100
   Pater nosters and 100 Ave Marias over his grave and every day to join
   in saying over it 15 of each. [1298] Damian of Löwen and his wife, who
   endowed a hospital at Cologne,1450, stipulated that "the very poorest
   and sickest were to be taken care of whether they belonged to Cologne
   or were strangers."

   Rome had more than one hospital endowment. The foundation of Cardinal
   John Colonna at the Lateran, made 1216, still remains. In his History
   of the Popes (III. 51), Pastor has given a list of the hospitals and
   other institutions of mercy in the different states of Italy and justly
   laid stress upon this evidence of the power of Christianity. The
   English gilds, organized, in the first instance, for economic and
   industrial purposes, also pledged relief to their own sick and indigent
   members. The gild of Corpus Christi at York provided 8 beds for poor
   people and paid a woman by the year 14 shillings and fourpence to keep
   them. The gild of St. Helena at Beverley cared constantly for 3 or 4
   poor folk. [1299]

   Leprosy decreased during the last years of the Middle Ages, but
   hospitals for the reception of lepers are still extensively found,--the
   lazarettos, so called after Lazarus, who was reputed to have been
   afflicted with the disease. Houses for this malady had been established
   in England by Lanfranc, Mathilda, queen of Henry I. at St. Giles, by
   King Stephen at Burton, Leicestershire and by others till the reign of
   John. St. Hugh of Lincoln, as well as St. Francis
   d'Assissidistinguished themselves by their solicitude for lepers. But
   the disease seems to have died out in England in the 14th century and
   it was hard to fill the beds endowed for this class of sufferers. In
   1434, it was ordered that beds be kept for 2 lepers in the great Durham
   leper hospital "provided they could be found in these parts."
   Originally the hospital had beds for 60. [1300] Late in the 16th
   century there were still lepers in Germany. Thomas Platter wrote, "When
   we came to Munich, it was so late that we could not enter the city, but
   had to remain in the leperhouse." [1301]

   Begging was one of the curses of England and Germany as it continues to
   be of Southern Europe to-day. It was no disgrace to ask alms. The
   mendicant friars by their example consecrated a nuisance with the
   sacred authority of religion. Pilgrims and students also had the right
   of way as beggars. Sebastian Brant gave a list of the different
   ecclesiastical beggars who went about with sacks, into which they put
   with indiscriminate greed apples, plums, eggs, fish, chickens, meat,
   butter and cheese,--sacks which had no bottom.


   Der Bettler Sack wird nimmer voll;

   Wie man ihn füllt, so bleibt er hohl.

   In Germany, towns gave franchises to beg. [1302] The habit of
   mendicancy, which Brant ridiculed, Geiler of Strassburg called upon the
   municipality to regulate or forbid altogether. In England, mendicancy
   was a profession recognized in law.

   With the decay of the monastic endowments and the legal maintenance of
   wages at a low rate, the destitution and vagrancy increased. The
   English statutes of laborers at the close of this period,1495 and 1504,
   ordered beggars, not able to work, to return to their own towns where
   they might follow the habit of begging without hindrance. [1303]

   At a time when in Germany, the richest country of Europe, church
   buildings were multiplying with great rapidity, many churches in
   England, on account of the low economic conditions, were actually left
   to go to ruin or turned into sheepcotes and stables, a transmutation to
   which Sir Thomas More as well as others refers. The rapacity of the
   nobles and abbots in turning large areas into sheep-runs deprived
   laborers of employment and brought social distress upon large numbers.
   On the other hand, parliament passed frequent statutes of apparel, as
   in 1463 and 1482, restricting the farmer and laborer in his expenditure
   on dress. The different statutes of laborers, enacted during the 15th
   century, had the effect of depressing and impoverishing the classes
   dependent upon the daily toil of their hands. [1304]

   In spite of the strict synodal rules, repeated again and again, usury
   was practised by Christians as well as by Jews. All the greater
   Schoolmen of the 13th century had discussed the subject of usury and
   pronounced it sin, on the ground of Luke 6:34, and other texts. They
   held that charges of interest offended against the law of love to our
   neighbor and the law of natural fairness, for money does not increase
   with use but rather is reduced in weight and value. It is a species of
   greed which is mortal sin. [1305] It was so treated by mediaeval
   councils when practised by Christians and the contrary opinion was
   pronounced heretical by the oecumenical council of Vienne. Geiler of
   Strassburg expounded the official church view when he pronounced usury
   always wicked. It was wrong for a Christian to take back more than the
   original principal. And the substitution of a pig or some other gift in
   place of a money payment he also denounced.

   The rates of the Jews were exorbitant. In Florence, they were 20% in
   1430 and, in 1488, 32½%. [1306] In Northern Europe they were much
   higher, from 431/3 to 80 or even 100%. Municipalities borrowed.
   Clerics, convents and churches mortgaged their sacred vessels. City
   after city in Germany and Switzerland expelled the Jews,--from Spires
   and Zürich,1435, to Geneva,1490, and Nürnberg, Ulm and
   Nördlingen,1498-1500. The careers of the great banking-houses in the
   second half of the fifteenth century show the extensive demand for
   loans by popes and prelates, as well as secular princes.

   To afford relief to the needy, whose necessities forced them to borrow,
   a measure of real philanthropy was conceived in the last century of the
   Middle Ages, the montes pietatis, or charitable accumulations. [1307]
   They were benevolent loaning funds. The idea found widespread
   acceptance in Italy, where the first institutions were founded at
   Perugia,1462, and Orvieto,1463. City councils aided such funds by
   contributions, as at Perugia, when it gave 3,000 gulden. But in this
   case, finding itself unable to furnish the full amount, it mulcted the
   Jews for 1,200 gulden, Pius II. giving his sanction to the constraint.
   In cases, bishops furnished the capital, as at Pistoja,1473, where
   Bishop Donato de' Medici gave 3,000 gulden. At Lucca, a merchant, who
   had grown rich through commercial affiliation with the Jews, donated
   the princely capital of 40,000 gold gulden. At Gubbio, a law taxed all
   inheritances one per cent in favor of the local fund, and neglect to
   pay was punished with an additional tax of one per cent.

   The popes showed a warm interest in the new benevolence by granting to
   particular funds their sanction and offering indulgences to
   contributors. From 1463 to 1515 we have records of 16 papal
   authorizations from such popes as Pius II., Sixtus IV., Innocent VIII.,
   Alexander VI., Julius II. and Leo X. The sanction of Innocent VIII.,
   given to the Mantua fund,1486, called upon the preachers to summon the
   people to support the fund, promised 10 years full indulgence to
   donors, and excommunicated all who opposed the project. Sixtus IV., in
   commending the fund for his native town of Savona,1479, pronounced its
   worthy object to be to aid not only the poor but also the rich who had
   pawned their goods. He offered a plenary indulgence on the collection
   of every 100 gulden. In 1490, the Savona fund had 22,000 gulden and the
   limit of loans was raised to 100 ducats. [1308]

   The administration of these bureaus of relief was in the hands of
   directors, usually a mixed body of clergymen and laymen, and often
   appointed by municipal councils. The accounts were balanced each month.
   In Perugia, the rate, which was 12% in 1463, was reduced to 8% a year
   later. In Milan it was reduced from 10% to 5%, in 1488. Five per cent
   was the appointed rate fixed at Padua, Vicenza and Pisa, and 4% at
   Florence. The loans were made upon the basis of property put in pawn.
   The benevolent efficacy of these funds cannot be questioned and to
   them, in part, is due the reduction of interest from 40% to 4 and 10%
   in Italy, before the close of the 15th century. [1309] They met,
   however, with much opposition and were condemned as contravening the
   traditional law against usury.

   A foremost place in advancing the movement was taken by the Franciscans
   and in the Franciscan Bernardino da Feltre,1439-1494, it had its chief
   apostle. This popular orator canvassed all the greater towns of
   Northern Italy,--Mantua, Florence, Parma, Padua, Milan, Lucca, Verona,
   Brescia. Wherever he went, he was opposed from the pulpit and by
   doctors of the canon law. At Florence, so warmly was the controversy
   conducted in the pulpits that a public discussion was ordered at which
   Lorenzo de' Medici, doctors of the law, clerics and many laymen were
   present, with the result that the archbishop forbade opposition to the
   mons on pain of excommunication. The Deuteronomic injunction, 24:12
   sq., ordering that, if a man borrow a coat, it should be restored
   before sundown and the Lord's words, Luke 6, were quoted by the
   opposition. But it was replied, that the object of loaning to the poor
   was not to enrich the fund or individuals but to do the borrower good.
   Savonarola gave the institution his advocacy. [1310] The Fifth Lateran
   commended it and in this it was followed, 50 years later, by the
   Council of Trent.

   The attempt to transplant the Italian institution in Germany was
   unsuccessful and was met by the establishment of banks by municipal
   councils, as at Frankfurt. [1311] In England also, it gained no
   foothold. So strong was the feeling against lending out money at
   interest that, at Chancellor Morton's importunity, parliament proceeded
   against it with severe measures, and a law of Henry VII.'s reign made
   all lending of money at interest a criminal offence and the bargain
   between borrower and lender null and void.

   Notable expression was also given to the practice of benevolence by the
   religious brotherhoods of the age. These organizations developed with
   amazing rapidity and are not to be confounded with the gilds which were
   organizations of craftsmen, intended to promote the production of good
   work and also to protect the master-workers in their monopoly of trade.
   They were connected with the Church and were, in part, under the
   direction of the priesthood, although from some of them, as in Lübeck,
   priests were distinctly excluded. Like the gilds, their organization
   was based upon the principle of mutual aid [1312] but they emphasized
   the principle of unselfish sympathy for those in distress. Luther once
   remarked, there was no chapel and no saint without a brotherhood. In
   fact, nothing was so sure to make a saint popular as to name a
   brotherhood after him. By 1450, there was not a mendicant convent in
   Germany which had not at least one fraternity connected with it. Cities
   often had a number of these organizations. Wittenberg had 21, Lübeck
   70, Frankfurt 31, Hamburg 100. Every reputable citizen in German cities
   belonged to one or more. [1313] Luther belonged to 3 at Erfurt, the
   brotherhoods of St. Augustine, St. Anna and St. Catherine.

   The dead, who had belonged to them, had the distinct advantage of being
   prayed for. Their sick were cared for in hospitals, containing beds
   endowed by them. Sometimes they incorporated the principle of mutual
   benefit or assurance societies, and losses sustained by the living they
   made good. At Paderborn, in case a brother lost his horse, every member
   contributed one or two shillings or, if he lost his house, his
   fellow-members contributed three shillings each or a load of lumber.

   As there were gilds of apprentices as well as of master-workmen, so
   there were brotherhoods of the poor and humble as well as of those in
   comfortable circumstances. Even the lepers had fraternities, and one of
   these clans had fief rights to a spring at Wiesbaden. So also had the
   beggars and cripples at Zülpich, founded 1454. The entrance fee in the
   last case was 8 shillings, from which there was a reduction of one-half
   for widows. [1314]

   In the case of the Italian brotherhoods, it is often difficult to
   distinguish between a society organized for a benevolent purpose and a
   society for the cult of some saint. The gilds of Northern Italy, as a
   rule, laid emphasis upon religious duties such as attendance upon mass,
   confession of sins and refraining from swearing. The Roman societies
   had their patron saints,--the blacksmith and workers in gold, St.
   Eligius, the millers Paulinus of Nola, the barrel-makers St. James, the
   inn-keepers St. Blasius and St. Julian, the masons St. Gregory the
   Great, the barbers and physicians St. Cosmas and St. Damian, the
   painters St. Luke and the apothecaries St. Lawrence. The popes
   encouraged the confraternities and elevated some of them to the dignity
   of archfraternities, as St. Saviour in Rome, the first to win this
   distinction. Florence was also good soil for religious brotherhoods. At
   the beginning of the 16th century, there were no less than 73 within
   its bounds, some of them societies of children. [1315]

   Society did not wait for the present age to apply the principle of
   Christian charity. The development of organizations and bureaus in the
   15th century was not carried as far as it is to-day, and for the good
   reason that the same demand for it did not exist. The cities were small
   and it was possible to carry out the practice of individual relief with
   little fear of deception.

   § 80. The Sale of Indulgences.

   Nowhere, except in the lives of the popes themselves, did the
   humiliation of the Western Church find more conspicuous exhibition than
   in the sale of indulgences. The forgiveness of sins was bought and sold
   for money, and this sacred privilege formed the occasion of the rupture
   of Western Christendom as, later, the Lord's Supper became the occasion
   of the chief division between the Protestant churches.

   Originally an indulgence was the remission of a part or all of the
   works of satisfaction demanded by the priest in the sacrament of
   penance. This is the definition given by Roman Catholic authorities
   to-day. [1316] In the 13th century, it came to be regarded as a
   remission of the penalty of sin itself, both here and in purgatory. At
   a later stage, it was regarded, at least in wide circles, as a release
   from the guilt of sin as well as from its penalty. The fund of merits
   at the Church's disposition--thesaurus meritorum -- as defined by
   Clement VI., in 1343, is a treasury of spiritual assets, consisting of
   the infinite merits of Christ, the merits of Mary and the
   supererogatory merits of the saints, which the Church uses by virtue of
   the power of the keys. One drop of Christ's blood, so it was argued,
   was sufficient for the salvation of the world, and yet Christ shed all
   his blood and Mary was without stain. From the vast surplus
   accumulation supplied by their merits, the Church had the right to draw
   in granting remission to sinners from the penalties resulting from the
   commission of sin. The very term "keys," it was said, implies a
   treasure which is looked away and to which the keys give access. [1317]
   The authority to grant indulgences was shared by the pope and the
   bishops. The law of Innocent III., intended to check its abuse,
   restricted the time for which bishops might grant indulgence to 40
   days, the so-called quarantines. By the decree of Pius X., issued Aug.
   28,1903, cardinals, even though they are not priests, may issue
   indulgences in their titular churches for 200 days, archbishops for 100
   and bishops for 50 days.

   The application of indulgence to the realm of purgatory by Sixtus IV.
   was a natural development of the doctrine that the prayers and other
   suffrages of the living inure to the benefit of the souls in that
   sphere. As Thomas Aquinas clearly taught, such souls belong to the
   jurisdiction of the Church on earth. And, if indulgences may be granted
   to the living, certainly the benefit may be extended to the
   intermediate realm, over which the Church also has control.

   Sixtus' first bull granting indulgence for the dead was issued 1476 in
   favor of the church of Saintes. Here was offered to those who paid a
   certain sum--certam pecuniam -- for the benefit of the building, the
   privilege of securing a relaxation of the sufferings of the purgatorial
   dead, parents for their children, friend for friend. The papal
   deliverance aroused criticism and in a second bull, issued the
   following year, the pontiff states that such relaxations were offered
   by virtue of the fulness of authority vested in the pope from above
   plenitudo potestatis -- to draw upon the fund of merits.. [1318]

   To the abuse, to which this doctrine opened the door, was added the
   popular belief that letters of indulgence gave exemption both from the
   culpability and penalty of sin. The expression, "full remission of
   sins," plena or plenissima remissio peccatorum, is found again and
   again in papal bulls from the famous Portiuncula indulgence, granted by
   Honorius III. to the Franciscans, to the last hours of the undisputed
   sway of the pope in the West. It was the merit of the late Dr. Lea to
   have called attention to this almost overlooked element of the
   mediaeval indulgence. Catholic authorities of to-day, as Paulus and
   Beringer, without denying the use of the expression, a poena et culpa,
   assert that it was not the intent of any genuine papal message to grant
   forgiveness from the guilt of sin without contrition of heart. [1319]
   The expression was in current use in tracts and in common talk. [1320]
   John of Paltz, in his Coelifodina, an elaborate defence of indulgences
   written towards the close of the 15th century, affirmed that an
   indulgence is given by virtue of the power of the keys whereby guilt is
   remitted and penalty withdrawn. These keys open the fund of the Church
   to its sons. [1321] Luther was only expressing the popular view when,
   writing to Albrecht of Mainz,1517, he complained that men accepted the
   letters of indulgence as giving them exemption from all penalty and
   guilt--homo per istas indulgentias liber sit ab omni poena et culpa.
   Not only on the Continent but also in England were such forms of
   indulgence circulated. For example, Leo X.'s indulgence for the
   hospital S. Spirito in Rome ran in its English translation, "Holy and
   great indulgence and pardon of plenary remission a culpa et poena."
   [1322] The popular mind did not stop to make the fine distinction
   between guilt and its punishment and, if it had, it would have been
   quite satisfied to be made free from the sufferings entailed by sin. If
   by a papal indulgence a soul in purgatory could be immediately released
   and given access to heavenly felicity, the question of guilt was of no
   concern.

   Long before the days of Tetzel, Wyclif and Huss had condemned the use
   of the formula, "from penalty and guilt," as did also John Wessel. In
   denouncing the bulls of indulgence for those joining in a crusade
   against Ladislaus, issued 1412, Huss copied Wyclif almost word for
   word. [1323] Wyclif fiercely condemned the papal assumption in granting
   full indulgence for the crusade of Henry de Spenser. Priests, he
   asserted, have no authority to give absolution without proper works of
   satisfaction and all papal absolution is of no avail, where the
   offenders are not of good and worthy life. If the pope has power to
   absolve unconditionally, he should exercise his power to excuse the
   sins of all men. The English Reformer further declared that, to the
   Christian priest it was given, to do no more than announce the
   forgiveness of sins just as the old priests pronounced a man a leper or
   cured of leprosy, but it was not possible for him to effect a cure. He
   spoke of, the fond fantasy of spiritual treasure in heaven, that each
   pope is made dispenser of the treasure at his own will, a thing dreamed
   of without ground." [1324] Such power would make the pope master of the
   saints and Christ himself. He condemned the idea that the pope could
   "clear men of pain and sin both in this world and the other, so that,
   when they die, they flee to heaven without pain. This is for blind men
   to lead blind men and both to fall into the lake." As for the pardoning
   of sin for money, that would imply that righteousness may be bought and
   sold. Wyclif gave it as a report, that Urban VI. had granted an
   indulgence for 2,000 years. [1325]

   Indulgences found an assailant in Erasmus, howbeit a genial assailant.
   In his Praise of Folly, he spoke of the "cheat of pardons and
   indulgences." These lead the priests to compute the time of each soul's
   residence in purgatory and to assign them a longer or shorter
   continuance according as the people purchase more or fewer of these
   salable exemptions. By this easy way of purchasing pardon any notorious
   highwayman, any plundering bandit or any bribe-taking judge may for a
   part of their unjust gains secure atonement for perjuries, lusts,
   bloodsheds, debaucheries and other gross impieties and, having paid off
   arrears, begin upon a new score. The popular idea was no doubt stated
   by Tyndale in answer to Sir Thomas More when he said, that "men might
   quench almost the terrible fire of hell for three halfpence." [1326]

   It is fair to say that, while the last popes of the Middle Ages granted
   a great number of indulgences, the exact expression, "from guilt and
   penalty," does not occur in any of the extant papal copies [1327]
   although some of their expressions seem fully to imply the exemption
   from guilt. Likewise, it must be said that they also contain the usual
   expressions for penitence as a condition of receiving the grace--"being
   truly penitent and confessing their sins"--vere poenitentibus et
   confessio.

   Indulgences in the last century of the Middle Ages were given for all
   sorts of benevolent purposes, crusades against the Turks, the building
   of churches and hospitals, in connection with relics, for the
   rebuilding of a town desolated by fire, as Brüx, for bridges and for
   the repair of dikes, such an indulgence being asked by Charles V. The
   benefits were received by the payment of money and a portion of the
   receipts, from 33% to 50%, was expected to go to Rome. The territory
   chiefly, we may say almost exclusively, worked for such enterprises was
   confined to the Germanic peoples of the Continent from Switzerland and
   Austria to Norway and Sweden. England, France and Spain were hardly
   touched by the traffic. Cardinal Ximenes set forth the damage done to
   ecclesiastical discipline by the practice and, as a rule, it was under
   other pretexts that papal moneys were received from England. [1328]

   In the transmission of the papal portions of the indulgence-moneys, the
   house of the Fuggers figures conspicuously. Sometimes it charged 5%,
   sometimes it appropriated amounts not reckoned strictly on the basis of
   a fixed per cent. The powerful banking-firm, also responding cheerfully
   to any request made to them, often secured the grant of indulgences in
   Rome. The custodianship of the chests, into which the indulgence-moneys
   were cast, was also a matter of much importance and here also the
   Fuggers figured prominently. Keys to such chests were often distributed
   to two or three parties, one of whom was apt to be the representative
   of the bankers.

   Among the more famous indulgences for the building of German churches
   were those for the construction of a tower in Vienna,1514, for the
   rebuilding of the Cathedral of Constance, which had suffered great
   damage from fire,1511, the building of the Dominican church in
   Augsburg,1514, the restoration of the Cathedral of Treves,1515, and the
   building of St. Annaberg church,1517, in which Duke George of Saxony
   was much interested. One-half of the moneys received for these
   constructions went to Rome. In most of these cases, the Fuggers acted
   as agents to hold the keys of the chest and transmit the moneys to the
   papal exchequer. The sees of Constance, Chur, Augsburg and Strassburg
   were assigned as the territory in which indulgences might be sold for
   the cathedral in Constance. No less than four bulls of indulgence were
   issued in 1515 for the benefit of Treves, including one for those who
   visited the holy coat which was found 1512 and was to be exhibited
   every 7 years. [1329]

   Among the noted hospitals to which indulgences were issued--that is,
   the right to secure funds by their sale--were hospitals in
   Nürnberg,1515, Strassburg,1518 and S. Spirito, Rome,1516.

   Both of the churches in Wittenberg were granted indulgences and a
   special indulgence was issued for the reliquary-museum which the
   elector Frederick had collected. An indulgence of 100 days was attached
   to each of the 5,005 specimens and another 100 to each of the 8
   passages between the cases that held them. With the 8,133 relics at
   Halle and the 42 entire bodies, millions and billions of days of
   indulgence were associated, a sort of anticipation of the geologic
   periods moderns demand. To be more accurate, these relics were good for
   pardons covering 39,245,120 years and 220 days and the still further
   period of 6,540,000 quarantines, each of 40 days.

   In Rome, the residence of the supreme pontiffs, as we might well have
   expected, the offer of indulgences was the most copious, almost as
   copious as the drops on a rainy day. According to the Nürnberger
   relic-collector, Nicolas Muffel, every time the skulls of the Apostles
   were shown or the handkerchief of St. Veronica, the Romans who were
   present received a pardon of 7,000 days, other Italians 10,000 and
   foreigners 14,000. In fact, the grace of the ecclesiastical authorities
   was practically boundless. Not only did the living seek indulgences,
   but even the dying stipulated in their wills that a representative
   should go to Assisi or Rome or other places to secure for their souls
   the benefit of the indulgences offered there.

   Prayers also had remarkable offers of grace attached to them. According
   to the penitential book, The Soul's Joy, the worshipper offering its
   prayers to Mary received 11,000 years indulgence and some prayers, if
   offered, freed 15 souls from purgatory and as many earthly sinners from
   their sins. It professed to give one of Alexander Vl.'s decrees,
   according to which prayer made three times to St. Anna secured 1,000
   years indulgence for mortal sins and 20,000 for venial. The Soul's
   Garden claimed that one of Julius II.'s indulgences granted 80,000
   years to those who would pray a prayer to the Virgin which the book
   gave. No wonder Siebert, a Roman Catholic writer, is forced to say that
   "the whole atmosphere of the later Middle Ages was soaked with the
   indulgence-passion." [1330]

   An indulgence issued by Alexander VI., in 1502, was designed to secure
   aid for the knights of the Teutonic Order against the Russians. The
   latter was renewed by Julius II. and Cologne, Treves, Mainz, Bremen,
   Bamberg and other sees were assigned as the territory. Much money was
   collected, the papal treasury receiving one-third of the returns. The
   preaching continued till 1510 and Tetzel took a prominent part in the
   campaign. [1331]

   It remains to speak of the most important of all of the indulgences,
   the indulgence for the construction of St. Peter's in Rome. This
   interest was pushed by two notable popes, Julius II. and Leo X., and
   called forth the protest of Luther, which shook the power of the papacy
   to its foundations. It seems paradoxical that the chief monument of
   Christian architecture should have been built in part out of the
   proceeds of the scandalous traffic in absolutions.

   On April 18,1506, soon after the laying of the cornerstone of St.
   Peter's, Julius II. issued a bull promising indulgence to those who
   would contribute to its construction, fabrica, as it was called.
   Eighteen months later, Nov. 4,1507, he commissioned Jerome of
   Torniello, a Franciscan Observant, to oversee the preaching of the bull
   in the so-called 25 Cismontane provinces, which included Northern
   Italy, Austria, Bohemia and Poland. By a later decree Switzerland was
   added. [1332] Germany was not included and probably for the reason that
   a number of indulgence bulls were already in force in most of its
   territory. A special rescript appointed Warham, archbishop of
   Canterbury, as chief overseer of the business in England. At Julius'
   death, the matter was taken up by Leo X. and pushed.

   The preaching of indulgences in Germany for the advantage of St.
   Peter's began in the pontificate of Leo X. and is closely associated
   with the elevation of Albrecht of Hohenzollern to the sees of Mainz,
   Magdeburg and Halberstadt. Albrecht, a brother of Joachim, elector of
   Brandenburg, was chosen in 1513 to the archbishopric of Magdeburg and
   the bishopric of Halberstadt. The objections on the ground of his age
   and the combination of two sees--a thing, however, which was true of
   Albrecht's predecessor--were set aside by Leo X., after listening to
   the arguments made by the German embassies.

   In 1514, Albrecht was further honored by being elected archbishop of
   Mainz. The last incumbent, Uriel of Gemmingen, died the year before.
   The archdiocese had been unfortunate with its bishops. Berthold of
   Henneberg had died 1504 and James of Liebenstein in 1508. These
   frequent changes necessitated a heavy burden of taxation to enable the
   prelates to pay their tribute to the Holy See, which amounted to 10,000
   ducats in each case, with sundry additions. By the persuasion of the
   elector Joachim and the Fuggers, Leo sanctioned Albrecht's election to
   the see of Mainz. He was given episcopal consecration and thus the
   three sees were joined in the hands of a man who was only 24.

   But Albrecht's confirmation as archbishop was not secured without the
   payment of a high price. The price,10,000 ducats, was set by the
   authorities in Rome and did not originate with the German embassy,
   which had gone to prosecute the case. The proposition came from the
   Vatican itself and at the very moment the Lateran council was voting
   measures for the reform of the Church. It carried with it the promise
   of a papal indulgence for the archbishop's territories. The elector
   Joachim expressed some scruples of conscience over the purchase, but it
   went through. Schulte exclaims that, if ever a benefice was sold for
   gold, this was true in the case of Albrecht. [1333]

   The bull of indulgences was issued March 31,1516, and granted the young
   German prelate the right to dispose of pardons throughout the half part
   of Germany, the period being fixed at 8 years. The bull offered,
   "complete absolution--plenissimam indulgentiam -- and remission of all
   sins," sins both of the living and the dead. A private paper, emanating
   from Leo and dated two weeks later, April 15, mentions the 10,000
   ducats proposed by the Vatican as the price of Albrecht's confirmation
   as having been already placed in Leo's hands. [1334] To enable him to
   pay the full amount of 30,000 ducats his ecclesiastical dignities had
   cost, Albrecht borrowed from the Fuggers and, to secure funds, he
   resorted to a two-years' tax of two-fifths which he levied on the
   priests, the convents and other religious institutions of his dioceses.
   In 1517, "out of regard for his Holiness, the pope, and the salvation
   and comfort of his people," Joachim opened his domains to the
   indulgence-hawkers. It was his preaching in connection with this bull
   that won for Tetzel an undying notoriety. Oldecop, writing in 1516, of
   what he saw, said that people, in their eagerness to secure deliverance
   from the guilt and penalty of sin and to get their parents and friends
   out of purgatory, were putting money into the chest all day long.

   The description of Tetzel's sale of indulgences and Luther's protest
   are a part of the history of the Reformation. It remains, however, yet
   to be said, as belonging to the mediaeval period, that the grace of
   indulgences was popularly believed to extend to sins, not yet
   committed. Such a belief seems to have been encouraged by the
   pardon-preachers, although there is no documentary proof that any papal
   authorities made such a promise. In writing to the archbishop of Mainz,
   Oct. 31,1517, Luther had declared that it was announced by the
   indulgence-hawkers that no sin was too great to be covered by the
   indulgence, nay, not even the sin of violating the Virgin, if such a
   thing had been possible. And late in life,1541, the Reformer stated
   that the pardoner "also sold sins to be committed." [1335] The story
   ran that a Saxon knight went to Tetzel and offered him 10 thaler for a
   sin he had in mind to commit. Tetzel replied that he had full power
   from the pope to grant such an indulgence, but that it was worth 80
   thaler. The knight paid the amount, but some time later waylaid Tetzel
   and took all his indulgence-moneys from him. To Tetzel's complaints the
   robber replied, that thereafter he must not be so quick in giving
   indulgence from sins, not yet committed. [1336]

   The traffic in ecclesiastical places and the forgiveness of sins
   constitutes the very last scene of mediaeval Church history. On the eve
   of the Reformation, we have the spectacle of the pope solemnly renewing
   the claim to have rule over both spheres, civil and ecclesiastical, and
   to hold in his hand the salvation of all mankind, yea, and actually
   supporting the extravagant luxuries of his worldly court with moneys
   drawn from the trade in sacred things. How deep-seated the pernicious
   principle had become was made manifest in the bull which Leo issued,
   Nov. 9,1518, a full year after the nailing of the Theses on the church
   door at Wittenberg, in which all were threatened with excommunication
   who failed to preach and believe that the pope has the right to grant
   indulgences. [1337]

   Society of Jesus, whose work on indulgences has the sanction of the
   Congregation of Indulgences of the College of Cardinals. Both writers
   insist that the indulgence does not confer forgiveness of guilt but
   only the remission of penalty after guilt is forgiven. See also on the
   general subject this Hist., V. 1, pp. 735-748, VI. 146 sqq.

   indulgences to the dead, see Köhler, p. 40.

   [1319] Paulus, 97 sq., and Beringer, p. 11, either explain the
   expression to mean the penalty of guilt, as if it read a poena culpae
   delicta, or refer it to venial sins. See Vol. V. 1, p. 741. The Jubilee
   bull of Boniface VIII., 1300, was interpreted by a cardinal to include
   in its benefits guilt as well as penalty--duplex indulgentia culpae
   videlicet et poenae. Köhler, p. 18 sq., gives the text of the bull.
   John XXIII. confessed to have often absolved a culpa et poena.

   [1320] It was used by Piers Plowman (see Lea: Sacerd. Celibacy, I.

   Paulus, p. 39), etc. Oldecop said that those who cast their money into
   the chest and confessed their sins were " absolved from all their sins
   and from pain and guilt." For other cases and a general treatment of

   the least devout to God. And when the heavenly porter charged him with
   a readiness to destroy the very world itself and ruin the pope, the
   architect confessed and declared that his failure was due to the fact
   that "Julius did not put his hand Into his pocket to build the new
   church but relied on indulgences and the confessional." Paris de

   left behind reported that his companions had been released by friends,
   but that he was without a single friend. So, for the unfortunate soul's
   benefit, one of the pilgrims made a pilgrimage to Rome, and the soul at
   once took its flight to heaven. "So may a soul," the moral went on to
   say, "be released from purgatorial fire, if only 50 Pater nosters be
   said for it."

   No period in the history of the Christian Church has a more clear date
   set for its close than the Middle Ages. In whatever light the
   Protestant Reformation is regarded there can be no doubt that a new age
   began with the nailing of the Theses on the church doors in Wittenberg.
   All attempts to find another date for the beginning of modern history
   have failed, whether the date be the reign of Philip the Fair or the
   Fall of Constantinople,1453, or the invention of printing. Much as the
   invention of movable type has done for the spread of intelligence, the
   personality and conduct of Luther must always be looked upon as the
   source from which the new currents of human thought and action in
   Western Europe emanated. [1338]

   Not so easy, however, is it to fix a satisfactory date for the opening
   of the Middle Ages. They have been dated from Charlemagne, the founder
   of the Holy German Empire, the patron of learning, the maker of codes
   of law. The better starting-point is the pontificate of Gregory the
   Great, who is well called the last of the Fathers and the first of the
   mediaeval popes. From that date, the rift between the Eastern and the
   Western Churches, which was already wide as a result of the arrogance
   of the bishops of Rome, rapidly grew to be unhealable.

   The Middle Ages, with their limits, fall easily into 3 periods, but it
   must be confessed that the first, extending from 600-1050, is a period
   of warring elements, with no orderly development. Hildebrand properly
   opens the Middle Ages as a period of great ideas, conscious of its
   power and begetting movements which have exerted a tremendous influence
   upon the history of the Church. From the moment that monk entered Rome,
   the stream of ecclesiastical affairs proceeded on its course between
   well-defined banks. During the 500 years that followed, the voice of
   the supreme pontiff was heard above all other voices and controlled
   every movement emanating from the Church. In this period, the doctrinal
   system, which is distinctively known as the mediaeval, came to its full
   statement. It was the period of great corporate movements, of the
   Crusades, the Mendicant orders, of the cathedrals and universities, of
   the canon law and the sacramental combination and of the Reformatory
   councils.

   The third period of the Middle Ages, which this volume traverses, is at
   once the product of the former period of Gregory VII. and Innocent III.
   and, at the same time, the germinative seed-plot of new forces. The
   sacerdotal keeps its hold and the papacy remains the central tribunal
   and court of Europe, but protests were heard--vigorous and startling
   from different quarters, from Prag, Paris, Oxford--which, without
   overthrowing old institutions, shook the confidence in their Apostolic
   appointment and perpetuity. These last two centuries of the mediaeval
   world betray no consuming passion like the Crusades, for all efforts of
   the pope to stir the dead nerves of that remarkable impulse were
   futile. And Pius II., looking from the bluffs of Ancona out upon the
   sea in the hope of discerning ships rigged to undertake the reconquest
   of the East, furnishes a pathetic spectacle of an attempt to call forth
   energies to achieve the dreams of the past, when for practical minds
   the illusion itself has already disappeared.

   The Reformatory councils endeavored to undo what Hildebrand and
   Innocent III. had built up and Thomas Aquinas had sanctioned, the
   control of the Church and society by the will of the supreme pontiff.
   The system of the Schoolmen broke down. Wyclif, himself endowed with
   scholastic acuteness, belonged to that modern class of men who find in
   practical considerations a sufficient reason to ignore the contentions
   of dialectic philosophy. And, finally, the Renaissance completely set
   aside some of the characteristic notions of the Middle Ages, stirring
   the interest of man in all the works of God, and honoring those who in
   this earthly sphere of action wrought out the products of intellectual
   endeavor in literature and art, on the platform and in the department
   of state.

   This last period of the Middle Ages appears to the student of general
   history as a period of presentiments--and efforts on the part of
   scattered thinkers, to reach a more free and rational mode of thought
   and living than the mode they had inherited from the past. The period
   opening with Hildebrand and extending to Boniface VIII. furnished more
   imposing personalities,--architects compelling by the force of
   intellectual assertion,--but fewer useful men. It created a dogmatic
   unity and triumphed by a policy of force, but the rights of the
   individual and the principle of liberty of thought and conscience, with
   which God has chosen to endow mankind, it could not consign to
   permanent burial.

   However, in spite of the efforts put forth in the closing period of the
   Middle Ages to shake off the fetters of the rigid ecclesiastical
   compulsion, it failed. The individual reformers and prophets prepared
   the way for a new time, but were unable to marshal forces enough in
   their own age to inaugurate the new order. This it was the task of
   Luther to do.

   In a retrospect of the marked features of the closing centuries of the
   Middle Ages, we are struck first of all with the process by which the
   nations of Western Europe became consolidated until they substantially
   won the limits which they now occupy. The conquest of the weary
   Byzantine empire seemed to open the way for the Turks into all Europe.
   The acropolis of Athens was occupied in 1458. Otranto on the Italian
   coast was seized and Vienna itself threatened. All Europe felt as
   Luther did when he offered the prayer, "from the murderous cruelty of
   the Turk, Good Lord deliver us." Much as the loss of the city on the
   Bosphorus was lamented at this time, it cannot but be felt that there
   was no force in Eastern Christendom which gave any promise of progress,
   theological or civil.

   The papacy, claiming to be invested with plenitude of authority, abated
   none of its claims, but by its history proved that those very claims
   are fictitious and have no necessary place in the divine appointment.

   Seldom has a more impressive spectacle been furnished than was
   furnished by the Reformatory councils. Following the Avignon period and
   the age of the papal schism, they struggled to correct the abuses of
   the papal system and to define its limitations. The first oecumenical
   council held on German soil, the Council of Constance, made such an
   authoritative decision. Its weight was derived from its advocates, the
   most distinguished theologians and canonists of the time, and the
   combined voice of the universities and the nations of Latin
   Christendom. But the decision proved to be no stronger than a spider's
   web. The contention, which had been made by that long series of pungent
   tracts which was opened with the tract of Gelnhausen, was easily set
   aside by the dexterous hand of the papacy itself. Gelnhausen had
   declared that the way to heal the troubles in the papal household was
   to convoke a general council. [1339] To this mode of statement Pius II.
   opposed his bull, Execrabilis, and his successors went on untroubled by
   the outcry of Latin Christendom for some share in the government of the
   Church.

   But the appeal for a council was an ominous portent. It had been made
   by Philip the Fair and the French Parliament,1303. It was made by the
   Universities of Paris and Oxford and the great churchmen of France. It
   was made by Wyclif, by Huss and Savonarola. In vain, to be sure, but
   the body of the Church was thinking and the arena of free discussion
   was extending.

   The most extravagant claims of the papacy still had defenders. Augustus
   Triumphus and Alvarus Pelayo declared there could be no appeal from the
   pope to God, because the pope and God were in agreement. He who looks
   upon the pope with intent and trusting eye, looks upon Christ, and
   wherever the pope is, there is the Church. Yea, the pope is above canon
   law. But these men were simply repeating what was current tradition.
   Dante struck another note, when he put popes in the lowest regions of
   hell, and Marsiglius of Padua, when he cast doubt upon Peter's ever
   having been in Rome and insisted that the laity are also a part of the
   Church.

   The scandalous lives of the popes whose names fill the last paragraph
   of the history of the Middle Ages would have excluded them from decent
   modern circles and exposed them to sentence as criminals. They were
   perjurers, adulterers. Avarice, self-indulgence ruled their life. They
   had no mercy. The charges of murder and vicious disease were laid to
   their door. They were willing to set the states of Italy one over
   against the other and to allow them to lacerate each other to extend
   their own territory or to secure power and titles for their own
   children and nephews. Luther was not far out of the way when, in his
   Appeal to the German Nobility, he declared "Roman avarice is the
   greatest of robbers that ever walked the earth. All goes into the Roman
   sack, which has no bottom, and all in the name of God." In all history,
   it would be difficult to discover a more glaring inconsistency between
   profession and practice than is furnished by the careers of the last
   popes of the Middle Ages.

   Upon freedom of thought, the papacy continued to lay the mortmain of
   alleged divine appointment. Dante's De monarchia was burnt by John
   XXII. The evangelical text-book, the Theologia Germanica has been put
   on the index. Erasmus' writings were put on the Index. Curses were
   hurled against a German emperor by Clement VI. which it would almost be
   sacrilege to repeat with the lips. Eckart was declared a heretic.
   Wyclif's bones were dug up and cast into the flames. Huss was burnt.
   Savonarola was burnt. And, from nameless graves in Spain and Germany
   rises the protest against the papacy as a divine institution.

   Valla said again and again that the papacy was responsible for all the
   misfortunes of Italy, its worst enemy. To such a low plane was that
   institution brought that the Emperor Maximilian I. seriously considered
   having himself elected pope and combining in himself the two
   sovereignties of Church and state. That such a thought was possible is
   proof of the actual state of affairs. A most Catholic historian,
   Janssen (III. 77), says: "The court of Leo X., with its extravagant
   expenditure in card-playing, theatres and all manner of worldly
   amusements, was still more flagrantly opposed to the position of chief
   overseer of the Church than the courts of the German ecclesiastical
   princes, notably Albrecht of Mainz. The iniquity of Rome exceeded that
   of the ecclesiastical princes of Germany." And was not the chief idea,
   which some of the aspirants after the highest office in Christendom had
   in mind, well embodied in the words with which Leo followed his
   election, "Let us enjoy the papacy"? If the lives of these latter popes
   were unworthy, their treatment of the spiritual prerogatives was
   sacrilegious. Rome encouraged the Crusades but sent no Crusaders. In
   Rome everything was for sale. The forgiveness of sins itself was
   offered for money.

   And, within papal circles, there was no movement towards reform. As
   well might men have looked for a burnt field to furnish food. It is not
   improbable that the very existence of the papacy was saved by the
   Reformation. This is the view to which Burckhardt chooses to give
   expression twice in the same work. [1340] It discredited by its
   incumbents every high claim asserted for it. And yet, with abounding
   self-confidence, in the last hours of the Middle Ages, it solemnly
   reaffirmed the claim of supreme jurisdiction over the souls and bodies
   of men, the Church and the state. And after the Reformation had begun,
   Prierias, Master of the palace, declared the pope's superiority to the
   Scriptures in these words: "Whoever does not rest upon the doctrine of
   the Roman Church and the Roman pope as an infallible rule of faith,
   from which even the Holy Scriptures derive their authority, is a
   heretic." And to be a heretic meant to be an outlaw. Prierias was the
   man who spoke of Luther as "the brute with the deep eyes and strange
   fantasies."

   Forces of another character were working. In quiet pathways, the
   mystics walked with God and, though they did not repudiate the
   sacramental system, they called attention to the religion of the heart
   as the seat of religion. The Imitation of Christ was written once, for
   all ages. The Church had found its proper definition as the body of the
   elect and that idea stood in direct antithesis to the theory the
   hierarchy worked upon. The preaching of the Waldenses had been
   condemned by the Fourth Lateran Council, but there was a growing
   popular demand for instruction as well as the spectacle of the mass,
   and the catechetical manuals laid stress upon the sermon. The
   Albigenses had been completely blotted out, but the principles of
   Lollardism and Hussitism continued to flow, though as little rills. The
   Inquisition was still doing its work, but in Germany schools for all
   classes of children were being taught. The laity was asserting its
   rights in the domain of learning and culture. These influences were
   silently preparing the soil for the new teachings.

   In the 15th century, a potent force stirred Europe as Europe had never
   been stirred by it before,--Commerce. The industrial change, then going
   on, deserves more than a passing reference as a factor preparing the
   mind for intellectual and religious innovation. This, at least, is true
   of the German people. Explorations and the extension of commerce have,
   in more periods than one, preceded a revival of missionary enterprise.
   But, of all the centuries, none is so like the 19th as the last century
   of the Middle Ages,--vital with humanistic forces of all kinds. It was
   a time of revolution in the methods of trade and the comforts and
   prices of living. The world could never be again just what it had been
   before. There was marked restlessness among the artisan and peasant
   classes. This industrial unrest was adapted to encourage and to beget
   unrest in things ecclesiastical and to accustom the mind to the thought
   of change there.

   From Italy, whose harbors were the outfitting points for fleets during
   the Crusades, the centre of trade had shifted to the cities north of
   the Alps and to the Portuguese coast. Nürnberg, Ulm, Augsburg and
   Constance in Southern Germany; Bruges, Antwerp and other cities along
   the lower Rhine and in Flanders; and the cities of the Hanseatic League
   were bustling marts, turning out new and wonderful products of
   manufacture and drawing the products of the outside world through
   London, Lisbon, Lyons and Venice. Energy and enterprise were making
   Germany rich and her mercantile houses had their representatives and
   depots in Venice, Antwerp and other ports. [1341]

   Methods of business, such as to-day are suggesting grave problems to
   the political economist and moralist, were introduced and flourished.
   Trading companies and monopolies came upon the stage and startled the
   advocates of the old feudal ways by the extent and boldness of their
   operations. Trusts flourished in Augsburg and other German cities.
   [1342] Individuals and corporations cornered the import trade, the
   grain crop, the wine harvest, the silver, copper and iron product,
   sugar, linen, leather, pepper, even soap, for they used soap also in
   those days. The Höchstetters, the Ebners and the Fuggers were among the
   great speculative and trading firms of the age. They carried things
   with a high hand. Ambrose Höchstetter of Augsburg, for example, one
   season bought up all the ash wood, another all the grain and another
   all the wine. Nor was the art of adulteration left for these later, and
   often discredited, times to practice. They condescended to small
   things, even to the mixing of brick-dust with pepper. Commodities rose
   suddenly in price. In Germany, wine rose, in 1510, 49 per cent and
   grain 32 per cent. Imperial diets took cognizance of these conditions
   and tried to correct the evils complained of by regulating the prices
   of goods. [1343] Municipalities did the same. Preachers, like Geiler of
   Strassburg, charged the monopolists with fearing neither God nor man
   and called upon the cities to banish them. Professors of jurisprudence,
   for there was at that time no department of social science, inveighed
   against monopolies as spiders' webs to ensnare the innocent. [1344] It
   was a fast age. There was no precedent for what was going on. Men
   sighed for the good old times. Speculation was rampant and the prospect
   of quick gains easily captivated the people. They took shares in the
   investment companies and often lost everything. It was noticed that the
   directors of the companies were able to avoid losses which the common
   and unsuspecting investor had to bear. The confusion was increased by
   the readiness of town aldermen and city councillors to take stock in
   the concerns. It also happened that the great traders, whose ventures
   involved others in loss, were conspicuous in church affairs.

   To the wealth, arising from manufactures and foreign commerce, were
   added the riches which were being dug up from the newly opened mines of
   silver, copper and iron in Bohemia and Saxony. Avarice was cried down
   as the besetting sin of the age and, in some quarters, commerce was
   denounced as being carried on in defiance of the simplest precepts of
   the Gospel. [1345]

   With wealth came extravagance in dress and at the table. Municipalities
   legislated against it and imperial parliaments sought to check it by
   arbitrary rules. Wimpheling says, table services of gold were not
   unusual and that he himself had eaten from golden plates at Cologne.
   Complaint was frequently made at the diets that men were being brought
   to poverty by their expenditures for dress upon themselves and the
   expenditures of the female members of their households.

   In Germany, peasants were limited to a certain kind of cloth for their
   outer garments and to a maximum price. [1346] The women had their share
   in making the disturbance and dignified town councils sat in judgment
   upon the number of gowns and other articles of apparel and ornament the
   ladies of the day might possess without detriment to the community or
   hurt to the solvency of their indulgent husbands. The council of
   Ratisbon, for example, in 1485 made it a rule that the wives and
   daughters of distinguished burghers should be limited to 8 dresses, 6
   long cloaks, 3 dancing gowns, one plaited mantle with not more than 3
   sets of sleeves of silk velvet and brocade, 2 pearl hair bands not to
   cost more than 12 florins, one tiara of gold set with pearls, not more
   than three veils costing 8 florins each, etc. But why enumerate the
   whole list of articles? It is supposable the women conformed, even if
   they were inclined to criticise the aldermen for not sticking to their
   legitimate municipal business. Geiler of Strassburg had his word to say
   for these innovations of an extravagant age, the women with two dresses
   for a single day, their long trains trailing in the dust, the cocks'
   feathers worn in the women's hats and the long hair falling down over
   their shoulders. The times were cried down as bad. It is, however,
   pleasant to recall that a contemporary annalist commended as
   praiseworthy the habit of bathing at least "once every two weeks."

   Among the artisans and the peasants, the unrest asserted itself in
   strikes and uprisings, strikes for shorter hours, for better food and
   for better wages. Sometimes a municipality and a gild were at strife
   for years. Sometimes a city was bereft at one stroke of all the workers
   of a given craft, as was Nürnberg of her tin workers in 1475. The gilds
   of tailors are said to have been most given to strikes.

   The new social order involved the peasant class in more hardship than
   any other. The peasants were made the victims of the rapacity and
   violence of the landowners, who encroached upon their fields and their
   traditional but unwritten rights, and deprived them of the right to
   fish and hunt and gather wood in the forests. The Church also came in
   for its share of condemnation. One-fifth of the soil of Germany was in
   the possession of convents and other religious establishments and the
   peasant leaders called upon the monks and priests to distribute their
   lands. In their marching songs they appealed to Christ to keep them
   from putting the priests to death. The Peasant War of 1525 was not the
   product of the abuse of the principle of personal freedom introduced by
   the Reformation. It was one of a long series of uprisings and it has
   been said that, if the Reformation had not come and diverted the
   attention of the people, it is likely Germany would have been shaken by
   such a social revolution in the 16th century as the world has seldom
   seen. [1347]

   In England, the restlessness was scarcely less demonstrative and the
   condition of the laboring classes scarcely less deplorable. Their
   hardships in the 14th century called forth the rebellion of Watt Tyler.
   The famous statute of laborers of 1350 fixed the wages of reapers at 8
   pence a day; the statute of 1444, a century later, raised it to 5
   pence. The laws of 1495, Cunningham says, were intended to keep down
   the wages of the daily toiler. English legislation was habitually bent
   on preventing an artificial enhancement of prices. At the very close of
   the Middle Ages,1515, a regulation fixed the day's work from 5 in the
   morning until 7 or 8 in the evening in summer and during the hours of
   daylight during the winter. Legislation was sought to put a limit on
   prices against the inflation of combinations. Frauds and adulterations
   in articles offered for sale, bad work and false weights were
   officially condemned in 1504. Against the proclivity of the gilds to
   fix the prices of their wares at unreasonable figures, Henry VII. set
   himself with determination. With the development of sheep-walks farm
   hands lost their employment. [1348] To the author of Utopia the act of
   parliament in 1515, fixing wages, seemed to be "nothing else than a
   conspiracy of the rich against the poor," and, the laboring man was
   doomed to a life so wretched that even a beast's life in comparison
   seemed to be enviable."

   The discoveries in the New World and the nautical exploits, which
   carried Portuguese sailors around the Cape of Good Hope, also
   stimulated this feeling of restlessness. While the horizon of the
   natural world was being enlarged and new highways of commerce were
   being opened, thoughtful men had questions whether the geography of the
   spiritual world, as outlined in the scholastic systems, did not need
   revision. The resurrection of the Bible as a popular book stimulated
   the curiosity and questioning. The Bible also was a new world. The
   trade, the enterprise, the thought awakened during the last 70 years of
   the Middle Ages were incomparably more vital than had been awakened by
   the Crusades and the Crusaders' tales. When the Reformation came, the
   chief centres of business in Germany and England became, for the most
   part, seats of the new religious movement, Nürnberg, Ulm, Augsburg,
   Geneva, Strassburg, Frankfurt, Lübeck and London.

   The Renaissance, as has already been set forth, was another potent
   factor contributing to the forward impulse of the last century of the
   Middle Ages. All the faculties of man were to be recognized as worthy
   of cultivation. Europe arose as out of a deep sleep. Men opened their
   eyes and saw, as Mr. Taine put it. The Renaissance made the discovery
   of man and the earth. The Schoolmen had forgotten both. Here also a new
   world was revealed to view and Ulrich von Hutten, referring to it and
   to the age as a whole could exclaim, "O century, studies flourish,
   spirits are awaking. It is a pleasure to live!"

   But in the Renaissance Providence seems to have had the design of
   showing again that intellectual and artistic culture may flourish,
   while the process of moral and social decline goes on. No regenerating
   wave passed over Italy's society or cleansed her palaces and convents.
   The outward forms of civilization did not check the inward decline. The
   Italian character, says Gregorovius, "in the last 30 years of the 15th
   century displays a trait of diabolical passion. Tyrannicide,
   conspiracies and deeds of treachery were universal." In the period of
   Athenian greatness, the process of the intellectual sublimation of the
   few was accompanied by the process of moral decay in the many. So now,
   art did not purify. The Renaissance did not find out what repentance
   was or feel the need of it. Savonarola's admiring disciple, Pico della
   Mirandola, presented a memorial to the Fifth Lateran which declared
   that, if the prelates "delayed to heal the wounds of the Church, Christ
   would cut off the corrupted members with fire and sword. Christ had
   cast out the money-changers, why should not Leo exile the worshippers
   of the many golden calves?" In Italy, remarks Ranke, "no one counted
   for a cultured person who did not cherish some erroneous views about
   Christianity."

   The North had no Dante and Petrarca and Boccaccio or Thomas Aquinas,
   but it had its Tauler and Thomas à Kempis and its presses sent forth
   the first Greek New Testament. This was a positive preparation for the
   coming age as much as the Greek language was a preparation for the
   spread of Christianity through Apostolic preaching in the 1st century.
   German printers went to Rome in 1467 and as far as Barcelona. In his
   work on the new invention,1507, Wimpheling [1349] declared "that as the
   Apostles went forth of old, so now the disciples of the sacred art go
   forth from Germany into all lands and their printed books become
   heralds of the Gospel, preachers of the truth and wisdom." Germany
   became the intellectual market of Europe and its wares went across the
   North Sea to that little kingdom which was to become the chief bulwark
   of Protestantism. In vain did Leo X. set himself against the free
   circulation of literature. [1350]

   The Greek edition of the New Testament and the printing-press,--that
   invention which cleaves all the centuries in two and yet binds all the
   centuries together--were the two chief providential instruments made
   ready for Martin Luther. But he had to find them. They did not make him
   a reformer, the leader of the new age. Erasmus, whom Janssen
   mercilessly condemns, remained a moralizer. He lacked both the passion
   and the heroism of the religious reformer. The religious reformer must
   be touched from above. Reuchlin, Erasmus and Gutenberg prepared the
   outward form of the Greek and Hebrew Bible. Luther discovered its
   contents, and made them known.

   Such were the complex forces at work in the closing century of the
   Middle Ages. The absolute jurisdiction of the papacy was solemnly
   reaffirmed. The hierarchy virtually constituted the Church. Religious
   dissent was met with compulsion and force, not by persuasion and
   instruction. Coercion was substituted for individual consent. Popular
   piety remained bound in the old forms and was strong. But there were
   sounds of refreshing rills, flowing from the fresh fountain of the
   water of life, running at the side of the old ceremonials, especially
   in the North. The Revival of Letters aroused the intellect to a sense
   of its sovereign rights. The movement of thought was greatly
   accelerated by the printed page. The development of trade communicated
   unrest. But the lives of the popes, as we look back upon the age,
   forbade the expectation of any relief from Rome. The Reformatory
   councils had contented themselves with attempts to reform the
   administration of the Church. Nevertheless, though men did not see it,
   driftwood as from a new theological continent was drifting about and
   there were prophetic voices though the princes of the Church listened
   not to them. What was needed was not government, was not regulations
   but regeneration. This the hierarchy could not give, but only God
   alone. [1351]

   The facts, set forth in this volume, leave no room for the contention
   of the recent class of historians in the Roman Church,--Janssen,
   Denifle, Pastor, Nicolas, Paulus, Dr. Gasquet--who have devoted
   themselves to the task of proving that an orderly reform-movement was
   going on when the Reformation broke out. That movement, they represent
   as an unspeakable calamity for civilization, an apostasy from
   Christianity, an insurrection against divinely constituted authority.
   It violently checked the alleged current of progress and popes, down to
   Pius IX. and Leo XIII., have anathematized Protestantism as a poisonous
   pestilence and the mother of all modem evils in Church and state. In
   the attempt to make good this judgment, these recent writers not only
   have laid stress upon "the good old times,"--a description which the
   people of the 16th century would have repudiated, [1352] -- but have
   resorted to the defamation of the German Reformer's character, setting
   aside the contemporaries who knew him best, and violently perverting
   Luther's own words. Imbart de la Tour, the most recent French historian
   of this school, on reaching the year 1517, exclaims, "The era of
   peaceful reforms was at an end; the era of religious revolution was
   about to open." [1353]

   Lefèvre d'Etaples was not alone when he uttered the famous words: --

   The signs of the times announce that a reformation of the Church is
   near at hand and, while God is opening new paths for the preaching of
   the Gospel by the discoveries of the Portuguese and the Spaniards, we
   must hope that He will also visit His Church and raise her from the
   abasement into which she has now fallen.

   The Philosophy of Christ,--the name which Erasmus gave to the Gospel in
   his Paraclesis, prefixed to his edition of the New Testament,--was to a
   large degree covered over by the dialectical theology of the Schoolmen.
   What men needed was the Gospel and the bishop of Isernia, preaching at
   the Fifth Lateran council in its 12th session, spoke better than he
   knew when he exclaimed: "The Gospel is the fountain of all wisdom, of
   all knowledge. From it has flowed all the higher virtue, all that is
   divine and worthy of admiration. The Gospel, I say the Gospel." The
   words were spoken on the very eve of the Reformation and the council of
   the Middle Ages failed utterly to offer any real remedy for the
   religious degeneracy. The Reformer came from the North, not from Rome
   and as from another Nazareth. The angel of God had to descend again and
   trouble the waters and a single personality touched in conscience
   proved himself mightier than the wisdom of theology and wiser than the
   rulers of the visible Church.

   Remarkable the Middle Ages were for their bold enterprises in thought
   and action and they are an important part of the history of the Church.
   We acknowledge our debt, but their superstitions and errors we set
   aside as we move on in the pathway of a more intelligent devotion and
   broader human, sympathies, towards an age when all who profess the
   Gospel shall unite together in the unity of the faith in the Son of
   God.

   aside as we move on in the pathway of a more intelligent devotion and
   broader human, sympathies, towards an age when all who profess the
   Gospel shall unite together in the unity of the faith in the Son of
   God.

   [1338] Gregorovius, VII. 273, well says that "theoretically and
   practically the Reformation put an end to the universal power of the
   papacy and closed the Middle Ages as an epoch in the world's history."

   [1339] Gelnhausen in Martène, Thesaur. Nov. anec., Paris ed., 1717, II.
   1203. Conclusio principalis ista est quod pro remediando et de medio
   auferendo schismate moderno expedit, potest et debet concilium generate
   convocari.

   [1340] Renaissance, I. 136, II. 185. Ficker p. 13, speaks of "the
   incalculable advantage which accrued to the Catholic Church from the
   Reformation."

   [1341] For the transfer of the centre of the Levantine trade from
   Venice to Lisbon at the beginning of the 16th century, see Heyd, II.
   505-540. Heyd says that the discovery of the route to India around the
   Cape of Good Hope by the Portuguese hatte wie ein Donnerschlag am
   heiteren Himmel die Gemüther der Venetianer berührt. To counteract the
   stream of trade in the direction of Lisbon, the Venetians proposed a
   scheme for cutting a canal through the Isthmus of Suez in 1500 and, in
   the same interest, the Turks actually began that enterprise in 1529.
   Manuel, king of Portugal, in 1505 stationed a fleet at Calicut to
   prevent the Venetians from interfering with the export of Indian goods
   to Portugal. For the German Board of Trade at Venice, the fondaco dei
   Tedeschi, see Heyd, II. 520, etc.

   [1342] Writing in 1458, Aeneas Sylvius said, "The German nation takes
   the lead of all others in wealth and power." He spoke of Cologne as
   unexcelled in magnificence among the cities of Europe. At Nürnberg he
   found simple burghers living in houses, the like of which the kings of
   Scotland would have been glad to house in.

   [1343] So the Diet of Cologne, 1512. At the same time, however, it
   declared that its acts were not designed to prevent the association of
   merchants in trading companies. The Diet of Innsbruck, 1518, did the
   same, and complained of the trading companies for driving out the small
   dealers and fixing prices arbitrarily. Trithemius argued for laws
   protecting the people from the overreachings of avarice and declared
   that whosoever bought up meat, grain and other articles of diet to
   force up prices is no better than a common criminal. See Janssen, II.
   102, sq.

   [1344] So Christopher Kuppner of Leipzig, in his tract on usury,1508.
   He insists that magistrates should proceed against trading companies
   and rich merchants who, through agents in other lands, bought up
   saffron, pepper, com and what not and sold them at whatsoever price
   they chose. According to the secretary of the firm, Conrad Meyer, the
   capital of the Fuggers increased in 7 years 13,000,000 florins.

   [1345] A preacher in 1515 declared the spirit of speculation then
   prevailing to be of recent growth, only ten years old, and that it had
   not existed in former times. Janssen, II. 87.

   [1346] The diets of 1498 and 1500 forbade artisans to wear gold,
   silver, pearls, velvet and embroidered stuffs. They were forbidden to
   pay more than one-half a florin a yard for the cloth of their coats and
   mantles. Laws regulating dress were also passed in Italy. Elastic beds,
   false hair and other fashions came into vogue. Women sat in the sun all
   day to bleach their hair. In Florence, money was scented. See
   Burckhardt-Geiger, II. 87 sqq. John of Arundel, who was drowned at sea,
   1879, had 62 new suits of cloth of gold or tissue. By a parliamentary
   act of 1463, no knight or other person might wear shoes or boots having
   peaks longer than two inches, Soc. Engl., II. 426 sqq.

   [1347] Ficker, p. 107 sq.; Müller: Kirchengesch. II. 196 sq. Among
   these peasant leaders, the piper of Niklahausen was one of the most
   prominent. In the last quarter of the 15th century, tracts were
   circulated among the peasants, calling upon them to resist the
   oppression of the ruling classes and demand the secularization of
   Church lands.

   [1348] Rogers, p. 143; Cunningham, pp. 399, 457 sq., 468 sqq., 476
   sqq., 484.

   [1349] De arte impressoria. The printer Gutenberg lived 1397-1468 and
   his son-in-law, Schöffer, died 1502.

   [1350] In his bull of May 4, 1515. See Mirbt, p. 177.

   [1351] See Sohm's sententious words in closing his treatment of the
   Middle Ages, Kirchengesch.,15th ed., 1907, p. 122 sq. Colet, who was in
   Italy during the rule of Alexander VI. said: "Unless the Mediator who
   created and founded the Church out of nothing for himself, lay his hand
   with all speed, our most disordered Church cannot be far from death
   .... All seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ, not heavenly
   things but earthly things, what will bring them to death, not what will
   bring them life eternal."--Seebohm, p. 75.

   [1352] To the other testimonies in this vol. add Erasmus, Enchiridion,
   p. 11 sq.

   [1353] II. 579. An example of misrepresentation may be taken from
   Denifle, Luther u. Luthertum who picks out a single clause from one of
   Luther's sermons, Die Begierde ist gänzlich unbesiegbar, "Passion
   cannot be overcome," and holds it up as the starting-point for the
   Reformer's alleged profligate life. What could be more atrocious,
   unworthy of a scholar and a gentleman, when it was Luther's purpose in
   this very sermon to show that Christ imparts the power to overcome
   evil, which the natural man does not possess and calls upon men to flee
   to Christ's protection. In these last vols. Denifle outdid Janssen. Leo
   XIII. praised Janssen as a "light of historic science and a man of
   profound learning." Pius X. gave to Denifle the distinction of
   receiving the first copy of his book from the author's hand.
