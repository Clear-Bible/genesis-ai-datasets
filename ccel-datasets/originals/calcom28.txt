   TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE

   Contained in this Volume, as in the last, are the Writings of three
   Prophets: and they are explained and elucidated in the Author's
   peculiar manner; every sentence being dissected and examined, and the
   meaning ascertained according to the context, without the introduction
   of any extraneous matters. The main object throughout seems to have
   been to exhibit the genuine sense and design of the Sacred Writers.

   The Book of Jonah is a plain narrative, and no part is supposed to have
   been written in the style of poetry except the prayer in the second
   chapter.

   Some things in this Book have furnished Infidels with objections, and
   have induced some learned men, bearing at least the name of believers,
   to indulge in inventions. To satisfy Infidels or themselves, they have
   endeavored to prove, that this Book is either an historical allegory,
   or a parable, or a dream, or a moral fiction, or something else still
   more absurd and extravagant. But all these are mere vagrant
   conjectures, wholly groundless, rendered plausible only by a show of
   learning, and calculated to do tenfold more mischief than all the
   sneers and cavils of Infidels. The Bible Is A Book Of Miracles as well
   as of Prophecies; and an attempt to divest it of its Miracles is an
   attempt to divest it of one of its distinctive properties. Its
   Prophecies, which are continued Miracles, capable in many instances of
   ocular demonstration, attest those Miracles which were confined to
   certain times and occasions, as these were also in some cases performed
   for the purpose of gaining credit at the time to what was predicted.
   But there are no Miracles recorded in Scripture, which involve as much
   exercise of divine power as the fulfillment of Prophecies, though less
   visible in its operation. [1]

   The fact that Miracles of some sort form a part of the records of false
   religions and of superstitious times, is no reason for disbelieving the
   Miracles of Scripture. Almost all errors are imitations of truth, and
   superstition is man's substitute for true Religion. The existence of a
   false coin is no evidence that there is no genuine coin, but, on the
   contrary, proves that it exists. Independently of the general character
   of the Miracles recorded in Scripture, what has been just stated, their
   connection with indubitable Prophecies is an argument in their favor,
   which neither heathen nor Christian superstition is capable of
   adducing. Both must stand or fall together. If the truth of Prophecies
   be allowed, then the reality of Miracles cannot with any reason be
   denied. They are so connected together, that they cannot possibly be
   separated.

   Learned men, being driven back, as it were, by manifest and palpable
   absurdities, have sometimes resiliated beyond the limits of reason and
   truth; being disgusted, and justly so, by Heathen and Popish Miracles,
   they have often been imperceptibly led to doubt all Miracles, as when
   we are frequently deceived, we are tempted to conclude that there is no
   such a thing as honesty in the world. And hence has arisen the attempt
   to obliterate Miracles from Scripture; and various hypotheses have been
   suggested, and supported in some instances by no small measure of
   ingenuity and learning: but it is an attempt which ought in the
   strongest manner to be deprecated and condemned as being nothing less
   than a sacrilege, the robbing of God's Word of one of its peculiar
   characteristics, even of that by which God has visibly proved his
   supreme power; for by reversing and changing those laws of nature,
   which at the creation he had fixed and established, he has given a
   manifest demonstration of his Omnipotence and Sovereignty. He has made
   it known to the world by Miracles, that He who has constructed the
   wonderful mechanism of nature, can alter, change, and reconstruct it
   whenever He pleases.

   "The opinion," says Dr. Henderson, "which has been most generally
   entertained is that which accords to the Book a strictly historical
   character; in other words, which affirms that it is a relation of facts
   which actually took place in the life and experience of the Prophet.
   Nor can I view it in any other light while I hold fast an enlightened
   belief in the divine authority of the Books composing the Canon of the
   Old Testament, and place implicit reliance on the authority of the Son
   of God. Into the fixed and definite character of the Canon I need not
   here enter, having fully discussed the subject elsewhere; but assuming
   that all the Books contained in it possess the divine sanction, the
   test to which I would bring the question, and by which, in my opinion,
   our decision must be mainly formed, is the unqualified manner in which
   the personal existence, miraculous fate, and public ministry of JONAH
   are spoken of by our Lord. He not only explicitly recognizes the
   prophetic office of the son of Amittai, (Iona tou prophetou,) just as
   he does that of Elisha, Isaiah, and Daniel, but represents his being in
   the belly of the fish as a real miracle, (to semeion,) grounds upon it,
   as a fact, the certainty of the future analogous fact in his own
   history; assumes the actual execution of the commission of the Prophet
   at Nineveh; positively asserts that the inhabitants of that city
   repented at his preaching; and concludes by declaring respecting
   himself, "Behold! a greater than Jonah is here," (Matthew 12:39-41;
   16:4.) Now is it conceivable that all these historical circumstances
   would have been placed in this prominent light, if the person of the
   Prophet, and the brief details of his narrative, had been purely
   fictitious? On the same principle that the historical bearing of the
   reference in this ease is rejected, may not that to the Queen of Sheba,
   which follows in the connection, be set aside, and the portion in the
   First Book of Kings, in which the circumstances of her visit to Solomon
   are recorded, be converted into an allegory, a moral fiction, or a
   popular tradition? The two eases, as adduced by our Lord, are
   altogether parallel; and the same may be affirmed of the allusion to
   Tyre and Sidon, and that to Sodom in the preceding chapter."

   This reasoning is conclusive on the subject, and cannot be fairly
   evaded. Our learned author adds another consideration: --

   "Certainly in no other instance in which our Savior adduces passages
   out of the Old Testament for the purpose of illustrating or confirming
   his doctrines, can it be shown that any point or circumstance is thus
   employed which is not historically true. He uniformly quotes and
   reasons upon them as containing accounts of universally admitted facts,
   stamps them as such with the high sanction of his own authority, and
   transmits them for the confident belief of mankind in all future ages."

   That the preservation of Jonah in the bowels of the fish was an
   impossibility according to the course and nature of things, as they now
   exist, is quite evident: but it was no greater reversion of nature than
   the parting of the Red Sea, or the dividing of the streams of Jordan,
   or the sustentation of life in Moses during his stay on the Mount for
   forty days. The laws of nature were equally suspended in all these
   instances; and to deny to Him, who made these laws to be what they are,
   the power of changing them, is an inconsistency which no reason can
   justify.

   The next Prophet is Micah; and his Book is especially interesting on
   account of the prediction it contains of the birth-place of our Savior,
   and also of the establishment of his Kingdom, and the spread of his
   Gospel. The prophecy recorded in the fourth chapter is one of the most
   splendid in all the Writings of the Prophets. We find the same in the
   second chapter of Isaiah; but it is fuller and given more at large by
   Micah. The idea of borrowing seems not compatible with the fact, that
   each declares that what they delivered was conveyed to them by a
   vision: and there is nothing unreasonable in the thought, that the
   Divine Spirit communicated the very same things, to a certain extent,
   to two individual Prophets; and the fact that more, on the same
   subject, was revealed to one than to the other, seems to favor the
   notion, that the whole was communicated to each separately.

   It is a subject worthy of being noticed, -- that it was not the
   practice of the Prophets to refer to the testimony of one another, or
   even expressly to the commandments included in the Law of Moses. Isaiah
   indeed once said, "To the Law and to the Testimony." Though the sins
   which generally prevailed were distinctly condemned in the Law,
   especially the idolatry which was so common, they yet never quoted the
   commandments, and brought them to bear on the reigning corruptions.
   This may appear singular: but the way to account for it seems to be
   this, -- that the Prophets' authority was the same with that of Moses:
   Their communications proceeded from the same Author; and there was no
   necessity to confirm what they said by referring to what the Law
   sanctioned. The same God, who gave the Law by Moses, sent his messages
   to the people by his Prophets. And hence arises a strong, though, as it
   were, an incidental, proof of the Divine character of what they have
   written.

   The style of Micah much resembles, in some respects, the style of
   Hosea. His transitions are sometimes abrupt, and the sudden change of
   persons is not unfrequent. Lowth in his Prelections describes him as
   "being brief in words, sententious, concise, pointed, -- sometimes
   bordering on the obscurity of Hosea, -- in many parts lofty and fervid,
   and highly poetical." [2] Marckius says, that, "his diction is elegant,
   not very unlike that of Isaiah." [3] Henderson's account is more
   extensive, but on the whole just, as well as discriminating, -- "His
   style is concise, yet perspicuous, [4] nervous, vehement, and
   energetic; and, in many instances, equals that of Isaiah in boldness
   and sublimity. He is rich and beautiful in the varied use of tropical
   language, indulges in paranomasias, preserves a pure and classical
   diction, is regular in the formation of parallelisms, and exhibits a
   roundness in the construction of his periods, which is not surpassed by
   his more celebrated contemporary. Both in administering threatenings
   and communicating promises, he evinces great tenderness, and shows that
   his mind was deeply affected by the subjects of which he treats. In his
   appeals he is lofty and energetic. His description of the character of
   Jehovah, chap. 7:18-20, is unrivalled by any contained elsewhere in
   Scripture."

   "Some of his prophecies," says Newcome, "are distinct and illustrious
   ones, as Micah 2:12, 13; Micah 3:12; 4:1-4, 10; Micah 5:2, 3, 4; Micah
   6:13; 7:8-10. We may justly admire the beauty and elegance of his
   manner -- Micah 2:12, 13; Micah 4:1, 2, 3, and particularly the two
   first lines of verse 4; his animation, -- Micah 1:5, lines 3, 4; Micah
   2:7, 10, line 1; Micah 4:9; his strength of expression, -- Micah 1:6,
   8; Micah 2:3, lines 3, 4; Micah 3:2, 3, 12; Micah 7:1, 2, 4, line 1,
   19, line 2; his pathos, -- Micah 1:16; Micah 2:4; his sublimity, --
   Micah 1:2, 3, 4; Micah 3:6, 12; Micah 4:12, lines 3, 13; Micah 5:8;
   Micah 6:1, 9-16; Micah 7:16, 17."

   The three first chapters are throughout comminatory, in which judgments
   are denounced on both nations, the Jews and the Israelites, and in
   which are also enumerated the various evils which prevailed, idolatry
   as the chief, and its accompanying sins -- injustice, oppression, and
   cruelty. -- The fourth and the fifth chapters are of an opposite
   character, being prophetic of blessings, appertaining more especially
   to the Kingdom of Christ, while at the same time the previous
   sufferings and trials of the Church are graphically described. -- In
   the sixth chapter the people are summoned to a trial; the Lord had a
   controversy with them. Being proved guilty of ingratitude, ignorance,
   injustice, and idolatry, they are threatened with awful judgments. --
   In the seventh and last chapter the Prophet bewails the paucity of good
   men, deplores the faithlessness and perfidy of the people, turns to the
   Lord, entertains hope, foretells the restoration of the Church and the
   fall of its enemies, and ends with a rapturous exclamation, having been
   evidently favored with a glimpse of the rich and abundant mercies which
   God had in reserve for his people.

   The Prophet Nahum has but one subject -- the Fall Of Nineveh -- and he
   keeps to his subject without diverging to any other. In mentioning the
   sins of Nineveh, the first thing he states is a wicked design against
   the Lord, referring no doubt to the purpose formed of entirely
   destroying the Kingdom of Judah. In describing afterwards the vices of
   the people of Nineveh, he especially mentions their rapaciousness,
   deceit, injustice, oppression, and barbarous cruelty, and compares
   Nineveh to the den of lions.

   The special design of the Prophet in the description he gives, at the
   beginning of the first chapter, of the character of the Almighty, was
   to delineate him as He is to his enemies, as the God of vengeance, who
   vindicates his own honor, and defends his own cause against profane and
   rebellious opponents. He only makes a transient allusion to his
   goodness towards his people. The other subject was that which was
   suitable to his purpose. He was going to denounce irrevocable judgment
   on God's adversaries; he therefore described Him as the God of
   vengeance: and the extremely awful character here presented to us by
   one who spoke, as he was inspired from above, ought to be well weighed
   and seriously considered, especially by all those who are not become
   God's friends, but still continue his enemies.

   The second chapter contains a vivid description of the fierce
   assailants of Nineveh, of their success, of the plunder of the city,
   and of the captivity of its people, with an exultation over the den of
   lions. To prevent, as it were, any hope of escape, the Prophet, in the
   third chapter, gives, according to Calvin and many other Commentators,
   a graphic view of the ransack of the city, as though he were an
   eye-witness; then he states the reasons for this dreadful overthrow,
   reminds the Ninevites of what had happened to another powerful and well
   fortified city, shows the uselessness of resistance, and declares the
   doom of the city to be irrevocable and irremediable. How wonderfully
   exact has been the fulfillment of this Prophecy! [5] Who can
   contemplate it without acknowledging that He who spoke by the Prophets
   is the supreme, who rules and overrules all the events of time?

   The style of Nahum has been admired by all critics. Lowth says, that
   "no one of the minor Prophets seems to equal the sublimity, the
   vehemence and the boldness of Nahum: besides, his Prophecy is a
   complete and finished poem; his exordium is magnificent, and indeed
   majestic; the preparation for the destruction of Nineveh, and the
   description of its ruin, and its greatness, are expressed in most vivid
   colors, and possess admirable perspicuity and fulness." [6]

   This Volume contains a very interesting portion of The Minor Prophets.
   The History of Jonah is in many respects very instructive. [7] The
   Prophecies of Micah are some of the most remarkable in the Old
   Testament. Nahum exhibits in language the most awful the vengeance of
   the Almighty against the enemies of his Church. And readers will find
   that our Commentator continues to exercise his talents in that capacity
   with his wonted vigor, penetration, and judgment. An impartial
   consideration of his labors cannot fail to impress our minds with
   veneration for his character, and especially with gratitude to the only
   Giver of all good for having so richly endued his servant, and for
   having employed him in services so conducive to the interest of true
   religion. Such was the respect in which he was held by Bishop Horsley,
   whose learning and acuteness were not of an ordinary kind, that in
   quoting his comment on a portion of the eighteenth chapter of Isaiah,
   he calls him" The Venerable Calvin."

   Preface by the Author

   At what time Jonah discharged the office of a Teacher, we may in some
   measure learn from 2 Kings 14:1 for it is certain that he is the person
   there mentioned in Sacred history, as he is expressly called the son of
   Amittai [8] . It is said there that Jeroboam, the son of Joash, had
   enlarged the borders of his kingdom, from the entrance into Hamath to
   the sea of the desert, according to the word of Jonah, the servant of
   God, the son of Amittai, who came from Gath. It was then at that time,
   or shortly before, that Jonah prophesied. And it is certain that he was
   not only sent to the Ninevites, but that he also was counted a Teacher
   among the people of Israel. And the beginning also of his Book seems to
   intimate what I have said, -- that he was an ordinary Prophet among the
   people of Israel, for it begins with a copulative, And the Word of the
   Lord came to Jonah. Though the Holy Spirit does in other places speak
   sometimes in this manner, yet I doubt not but that Jonah intimates that
   he was recalled from the discharge of his ordinary office, a

   nd had a new charge committed to him, -- to denounce, as we shall see,
   on the Ninevites a near destruction.

   We must now then understand, that Jonah taught among the people of
   Israel, but that he received a command to go to the Ninevites. Of this
   command we shall take notice in its proper place; but it is right that
   we should know that he was not then only made a Prophet, when he was
   given as a Teacher to the Ninevites, but that he was sent to the
   Ninevites after having for some time employed his labors for God and
   his Church.

   This Book is partly historical and partly didactic. For Jonah relates
   what happened to him after he had attempted to avoid the call of God,
   and what was the issue of his prophecy: this is one thing. But at the
   same time he mentions the kind of doctrine which he was commanded to
   proclaim, and he also writes a Song of Thanksgiving. This last part
   contains doctrines and is not a mere narrative.

   I come now to the words.

   Jonah 1:1-2

   1. Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,

   1. Et fuit sermo Jehovae ad Ionam, filium Amittai, dicendo,

   2. Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their
   wickedness is come up before me.

   2. Surge, vade Niniveh, ad urbem magnam, et clama contra eam; quia
   ascendit malitia eorum coram facie mea.


   As I have before observed, Jonah seems here indirectly to intimate, [9]
   that he had been previously called to the office of a teacher; for it
   is the same as though he had said, that he framed this history as a
   part of his ordinary function. The word of God then was not for the
   first time communicated to Jonah, when he was sent to Nineveh; but it
   pleased God, when he was already a Prophet, to employ him among other
   nations. It might have been then, that he was sent to Nineveh, that the
   Lord, being wearied with the obstinacy of his own people, might afford
   an example of pious docility on the part of a heathen and uncircumcised
   nation, in order to render the Israelites more inexcusable. They made a
   profession of true religion, they boasted that they were a holy people;
   circumcision was also to them a symbol and a pledge of God's covenant;
   yet they despised all the Prophets, so that their teaching among them
   was wholly useless. It is then probable that this Prophet was taken
   away from them, that the Ninevites by their example might increase the
   sin of Israel, for in three days they turned to God, after Jonah had
   preached to them: but among the Israelites and their kindred he had,
   during a long time, effected nothing, when yet his authority had been
   sufficiently ratified, and thus, as we have already said, in their
   favor: for Jonah had predicted, that the kingdom of Israel would as yet
   stand; and however much they deserved to perish, yet the Lord fulfilled
   what he had promised by the mouth at his servant. They ought then to
   have embraced his doctrine, not only because it was divine, but
   especially because the Lord had been pleased to show his love to them.

   I do not indeed doubt, but that the ingratitude of the people was in
   this manner arraigned, since the Ninevites repented at the preaching of
   Jonah, and that for a short time, while the Israelites ever hardened
   themselves in their obstinacy. And hence some have refinedly expounded
   that passage in Matthew 12:39-41, This perverse generation seeketh a
   sign, and a sign shall not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the
   Prophet,' as though this intimated, that the Gospel was to be preached
   to the Gentiles, inasmuch as Jonah was taken away from his own nation,
   and was given as a teacher to foreign and heathen nations. They
   therefore suppose, that we are to understand this as a prophecy
   respecting the future call of the Gentiles, as though Christ had said,
   that he would hereafter go to the Gentiles, after having found the
   wickedness of the chosen people past recovery. But as Christ expressly
   applies this comparison, we ought not to draw his words here and there.
   [10] He indeed confines the similitude to one particular thing, that
   is, "As Jonah had been three days in the whale's bowels, so also he
   would be three days in the bowels of the earth;" as though he had said,
   that in this he would be like to Jonah, for he would be a Prophet
   brought to life again. And this was said designedly by Christ, because
   he saw that he was despised by the Jews, and that his labors were in
   vain: "Since ye now hear me not, and regard me as nothing, know that I
   shall be hereafter a new Prophet, even after my resurrection; so at
   length I shall begin to speak more effectually both to the Jews and to
   the Gentiles, as Jonah converted Nineveh, after having returned again
   to life." This then is the simple meaning of the passage. Hence Jonah
   was not a type of Christ, because he was sent away unto the Gentiles,
   but because he returned to life again, after having for some time
   exercised his office as a Prophet among the people of Israel. They then
   who say that his going forth was a token of the call of the Gentiles,
   adduce indeed what is plausible, but it seems to be supported by no
   solid reason; for it was in fact an extraordinary thing. God, then, had
   not as yet openly showed what he would do at the coming of Christ. When
   Naaman the Syrian was converted to the faith, (2 Kings 5:15) and a few
   others, God changed nothing in his ordinary proceedings: for there ever
   existed the special call of the race of Abraham, and religion was ever
   confined within the ancient limits; and it remained ever true, that God
   had not done to other nations as he had to the Jews, for he had
   revealed to them his judgments, (Psalm 147:20.) It was therefore God's
   will that the adoption of the race of Abraham should continue unaltered
   to the coming of Christ, so that the Jews might excel all other
   nations, and differ from them through a gratuitous privilege, as the
   holy and elect people of God.

   Those who adopt the contrary opinion say, that the Ninevites were
   converted to the Lord without circumcision. This is true; but I know
   not whether that was a true and legitimate conversion, which is
   hereafter mentioned; and of this, the Lord being willing, I shall again
   speak more fully: but it seems more probable, that they were induced by
   the reproofs and threatening of the Prophet, suppliantly to deprecate
   the impending wrath of God: hence God once forgave them; what took
   place afterwards does not clearly appear. It is certainly not probable
   that the whole city was converted to the Lord: for soon after that city
   became exceedingly hostile both to the Israelites and the Jews; and the
   Church of God was by the Ninevites continually harassed with
   slaughters. Since it was so, there is certainly no reason to think,
   that they had really and from the heart repented. But I put off a full
   discussion of this subject until we come to another passage. Let us go
   on now with our text.

   Arise, go to Nineveh, to that great city. Nineveh is called a great
   city, and not without reason; for it was in circumference, as heathen
   writers say, 400 stadia: and we shall see that Jonah was three whole
   days in going through the squares and streets of the city [11] . It
   hence follows, that it was a very large city, and this all allow.
   Profane writers call it Ninus, and say that it is a name derived from
   its founder; for it was Ninus, the son of Betas, who built it. But more
   correct is their opinion, who think that nynvh Ninue, is a Hebrew word:
   and hence what Herodotus and Diodorus, and others of the same class,
   say, is certainly fabulous, both as to the origin of the city and as to
   the whole progress of the kingdom, and their legends can easily be
   disproved by testimonies from holy Scripture. It is at the same time
   admitted by all, that Nineveh was a very large and a well fortified
   city. Babylon was afterwards built by Semiramis, who had been the wife
   of Betas: after her husband's death she wished to show that she also
   excelled in mind and industry, and that she had wisdom above her sex.
   But with regard to the founder of Nineveh, it is certain that the city
   was first built by Asshur: whether it was enlarged by Ninus, I know
   not: this, then, I leave as uncertain; for I wish not to contend about
   what is doubtful. But it is certain, from what Moses has said, that the
   founder of this city was Asshur, (Genesis 10:11.)

   As to the largeness of the city, even if profane writers had not said a
   word, the testimony of Jonah ought to be sufficient to us. Now, since
   he is bidden to go and proceed to Nineveh, the Lord gives him some hope
   of success. He indeed wrought effectually by the hand of his servant,
   Nahum; who, though he continued at home, yet prophesied against the
   Ninevites; but with a different view, and for another end. For as the
   people were then miserably distressed, and saw the kingdom or monarchy
   of Assyria in a flourishing state, they must have despaired, had not
   some solace been afforded them. Hence Nahum showed that God would be a
   judge against the Ninevites; that though he for a time favored and
   spared them, there was yet impending over them the dreadful judgment of
   which he speaks. Nahum, then, was not given as a teacher to the
   Ninevites, but was only a proclaimer, that the Jews might strengthen
   their faith by this comfort -- that they were not wholly rejected by
   the Lord, as he would some time avenge their wrongs. The case with
   Jonah was different: for he was sent to the city itself, to exhort the
   Ninevites to repent. Now the Lord, by speaking expressly of the
   largeness of the city, intended thus to prepare him with firmness, lest
   he should be frightened by the splendor, wealth, and power of that
   city: for we know how difficult it is to take in hand great and arduous
   undertakings, especially when we feel ourselves destitute of strength.
   When we have to do with many and powerful adversaries, we are not only
   debilitated, but our courage wholly vanishes away. Lest, then, the
   greatness of Nineveh should fill Jonah with terror, he is here prepared
   and armed with firmness. "Go then to Nineveh, and let not the power of
   that monarchy prevent thee to fulfill what I command thee; which is, to
   show to the Ninevites their sins, and to denounce on them destruction,
   if they repent not."

   We now then understand why Nineveh was called a great city: for had it
   not been for the reason just stated, it would not have been necessary
   that this should have been said to Jonah. The Israelites, I doubt not,
   knew well that it was a large city, and also possessed of strength and
   of a large number of men: but the Lord intended to set before his
   servant what might have been a hindrance to him in the discharge of his
   office; Go then to this great city. In short, God designed in this way
   to try Jonah, whether he would prefer his command to all the hindrances
   of this world. And it is a genuine proof of obedience when we simply
   obey God, however numerous the obstacles which may meet us and may be
   suggested to our minds, and though no escape may appear to us; yea,
   when we follow God, as it were with closed eyes, wherever he may lead
   us, and doubt not but that he will add strength to us, and stretch
   forth also his hand, whenever need may require, to remove all our
   difficulties. It was then the Lord's purpose to deal thus with Jonah;
   as though he had said to him, "remember who I am, and be content with
   my authority; for I have ready at hand all resources; when any thing
   stands in your way, rely on my power, and execute what I command thee."
   This is the import of the passage. Whenever then God demands any
   service from us, and we at the same time see that what the discharge of
   our duty demands is either difficult or apparently impossible, let this
   come to our minds, -- that there is not anything in the whole world
   which ought not to give way to God's command: we shall then gather
   courage and confidence, nor will anything be able to call us away from
   our duty and a right course, though the whole world were fighting
   against God.

   It now follows, Cry against her; for ascended has their wickedness
   before my presence. Cry, he says, against her: it was an unpleasant
   undertaking to cry out against her immediately at the beginning. We
   indeed know that men take pride in their power: and as there was then
   but one monarchy in the world, the seat of which was at Nineveh, a
   teacher could hardly expect to obtain a patient hearing, though he
   excelled in gracefulness of manner, and had acquired reputation, and
   brought an agreeable message. But Jonah was a foreigner, one unknown,
   and destitute of authority; and still more, he was immediately to
   denounce destruction on the Ninevites, to cry aloud, to reprove, to
   make a vehement proclamation, to threaten. How difficult was all this?
   We hence see how hard a command it was when God charged his Prophet to
   cry against Nineveh.

   It is now added, For their wickedness has ascended to me. By this
   clause God strengthens his servant Jonah; as though he said, "Thou wilt
   not, as an individual, have to contend with them, but I constitute thee
   as my herald, to summon them to my tribunal." And no doubt it must have
   served much to animate Jonah, that he had not to deal with the
   Ninevites as an individual, but as the messenger of God: and it might
   also have had an influence on their minds, to know, that though no
   mortal inflicted punishment for their crimes, they yet could not escape
   the vengeance of God. This then is the reason why the Lord here
   declares that he would be the judge of Nineveh. And at the same time he
   reminds us, that though the Ninevites felicitated themselves, and also
   gained the plaudits of the whole world on account of their power, yet
   all this was of no moment, because their wickedness and iniquity had
   ascended into heaven. When therefore we are reproved, there is no
   reason that we should turn our eyes here and there towards men; we
   ought instantly to present ourselves to the scrutiny of God; nay, we
   ought ourselves to take in hand that voluntary examination which God
   requires. By so doing, we shall not feed our vices by foolishly
   deceiving ourselves, as hypocrites do, who ever look around them to the
   right hand and to the left, and never raise up their thoughts to
   heaven. Let us go on --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [9] Calvin lays no great stress on the circumstance of the Book
   commencing with a v, but states what he thinks as its probable import.
   The fact that other Books, such as Joshua, Judges, 1 Samuel, Ezekiel,
   and other books, begin thus, is no proof that the copulative here does
   not intimate what is here stated. Marckius and Cocceius think that it
   imports a connection between the different Books of Scripture; and if
   so, why may it not intimate a connection between this Book and the
   former Prophecy of Jonah? Junius and Tremelius render the v "when," and
   connect it with "then" at the beginning of the third verse; and it may
   be so construed at the beginning of most of the other Books. Adopting
   this rendering, we may translate thus, --   1. When the word of Jehovah
   came to Johah,
   the son of Amittai, saying 2. Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city,
   and cry against her, for there wickedness has ascended before me. 3.
   Then Jonah arose to flee to Tarshish, from the presence of Jehovah, and
   went down to Joppa," etc. This reads connected, and the passage admits
   of this construction, for the copulative v in Hebrew, when repeated,
   may very frequently be thus rendered, the first by "when," and the
   second by "then." -- Ed.

   [10] Marckius wisely says on another subject, but on a similar
   occasion, "Extra Scripturam autem audacter hic sapiat nemo;" -- "but
   let no one be here rashly wise beyond Scripture." -- Ed.

   [11] There is some difference in the account given. Diodorus Siculus,
   as quoted by Marckius, says, that if it was in form oblong; one side
   was 150 stadia, the other 90; so that its circumference must have been
   480 stadia. A stadium is nearly equal to a furlong, eight of which make
   a mile. It must then have been in circuit about 60 miles. Its walls are
   reported to have been 100 feet high -- 33 yards and 1 foot, and so
   broad that three chariots might run abreast, and adorned by 1,500
   towers, the height of which were 200 feet. From the circumstance of
   having in it 120,000 not knowing the right hand from the left, supposed
   to be infants, some think that its population must have been above two
   million. It was situated on the river Tigris on the eastern side, not
   far from the present Mosul. In building this city, as reported by
   Bochart, there were no less than 140 myriads of men for eight years. A
   myriad being ten thousand, the number must have been one million, four
   hundred thousand. Such a city none has ever built since, was the
   declaration of Diodorus: and there has not probably on record an
   account of such a city. That it had large gardens, and even fields,
   within its walls, there can be no doubt. -- Ed.

   Jonah 1:3

   3. But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the
   Lord, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so
   he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto
   Tarshish from the presence of the Lord.

   3. Et surrexit Jonas ad fugendum (ut fugeret) Tharsis a facie Jehovae,
   et descendit Japho, et invenit navem, quae transibat Tharsis, et dedit
   mercedem (hoc est, naulum pretium vecturae,) et descendit in eam, ut
   iret cum ipsis (nempe cum mercatoribus vel nautis) in Tharsis a
   conspectu Jehovae.


   Jonah now relates how he sought hiding-places, that he might withdraw
   himself from the service of God; not that he deceived himself with such
   a gross notion, as that he would be no longer under the power of God,
   after having passed over the sea; but he intended to shun, as it were,
   the light of the present life, by proceeding to a foreign country. He
   was, no doubt, not only in a disturbed state of mind, when he formed
   such a purpose, but was utterly confused.

   It may be asked, why Jonah thus avoided the command of God. The Jews,
   indulging in frigid trifles in divine things, say that he feared lest,
   when he came to Nineveh, he should be deprived of the prophetic spirit,
   as though he were not in the same danger by passing over the sea: this
   is very frivolous and puerile. And further, they blend things of no
   weight, when reasons sufficiently important present themselves to us.

   It was first a new and unusual thing for Prophets to be drawn away from
   the chosen people, and sent to heathen nations. When Peter was sent to
   Cornelius, (Acts 10:17,) though he had been instructed as to the future
   call of the Gentiles, he yet doubted, he hesitated until he was driven
   as it were forcibly by a vision. What then must have come to the mind
   of Jonah? If only on account of one man the mind of Peter was
   disquieted, so as to think it an illusion, when he was sent a teacher
   to Cornelius, what must Jonah have thought, when he was sent to a city
   so populous? Hence novelty, doubtless, must have violently shaken the
   courage of the holy Prophet, and induced him to retake himself
   elsewhere, as one destitute of understanding. Again, doubt might have
   had an influence on him: for how could he have hoped that a people, who
   were notorious for their licentiousness, would be converted? He had
   indeed before an experience of the hardness of the chosen people. He
   had been faithfully engaged in his office, he had omitted nothing to
   confirm the worship of God and true religion among the people of
   Israel: but he had effected but little; and yet the Jews had been
   called from the womb. What then could he hope, when the Lord removed
   him to Nineveh? for unbridled licentiousness ruled there; there was
   also there extreme blindness, they had no knowledge of divine worship;
   in a word, they were sunk in extreme darkness, and the devil in every
   way reigned there. Doubt then must have broken down the spirit of
   Jonah, so that he disobeyed the command of God. Still further, the
   weakness of the flesh must have hindered him from following his
   legitimate call: "What then? even this, -- I must go to the chief city
   of that monarchy, which at this day treads under its feet the whole
   earth; I must go there, a man obscure and despised; and then I must
   proclaim a message that will excite the greatest hatred, and instantly
   kindle the minds of men into rage; and what must I say to the
   Ninevites? Ye are wicked men, God can no longer endure your impiety;
   there is, therefore, a dreadful vengeance near at hand.' How shall I be
   received?" Jonah then, being still surrounded by the infirmities of the
   flesh, must have given way to fear, which dislodged the love of
   obedience.

   And I have no doubt, in my own mind, but that Jonah discussed these
   things within himself, for he was not a log of wood. And doubtless it
   was not to no purpose, as I have already said, that he mentions that
   the city was great. God indeed sought to remove what might prove an
   hindrance, but Jonah, on the other hand, reasoned thus, -- "I see that
   I am to have a fierce contest; nay, that such a number of people will
   fall on me, enough to overwhelm me a hundred times, as the Lord has not
   in vain foretold me that the city is great." And though he might have
   had some hope, if they had been chastised, that they would give God his
   due honor; yet he confesses, that this hindrance came to his mind,
   which prevented him to proceed in the course of his calling. Hence
   doubt, as well as the fear of the flesh made Jonah to stumble, and
   novelty also, as I have already said, must have perplexed him; so that
   he preferred to go down, as it were, to the grave, than to undertake an
   office which apparently had no reason in its favor. For why were the
   Prophets sent, except to effect something by their labor, and to bring
   forth some fruit? but of this Jonah had no hope. Some authority was
   also allowed the Prophets, at least they were allowed the liberty of
   teaching; but Jonah thought that all entrance was closed up against
   him: and still more, Jonah thought that he was opposing the covenant of
   the Lord, who had chosen one people only; and he also thought that he
   was, as it were, fixed to his own land, when he was appointed a Teacher
   in his own country; he therefore could not remove elsewhere without
   feeling a great repugnance.

   I hence think, that Jonah disobeyed the command of God, partly because
   the weakness of the flesh was an hindrance, partly because of the
   novelty of the message, and partly because he despaired of fruit, or of
   success to his teaching.

   But he doubtless grievously transgressed: for the first rule, as to all
   our actions, is to follow the call of God. Though one may excel in
   heroic virtues, yet all his virtues are mere fumes, which shine before
   the eyes of men, except the object be to obey God. The call of God
   then, as I have said, holds the first place as to the conduct of men;
   and unless we lay this foundation, we do like him who would build a
   house in the air. Disordered then will be the whole course of our life,
   except God presides over and guides us, and raises up over us, as it
   were, his own banners. As then Jonah subverted the first and the only
   firm foundation of a right conduct, what could have remained for him?
   There is then no reason for us to extenuate his fault, for he could not
   have sinned more grievously than by forsaking God, in having refused to
   obey his call: it was, as it were to shake off the yoke; and this he
   confesses himself.

   They therefore very childishly write who wish to be his apologists,
   since he twice condemns himself -- Jonah rose up to flee from the
   presence of Jehovah -- to go unto Tarshish from the presence of
   Jehovah. Why does he the second time repeat, from the presence of
   Jehovah? He meant, no doubt, to express here more distinctly his fault:
   and the repetition is indeed very emphatical: and it also proves
   clearly that it was not a slight offense, when Jonah retook himself
   elsewhere when he was sent to Nineveh. He could not indeed have
   departed from the Lord, for God fills heaven and earth; and, as I have
   said already, he was not fascinated by so gross an error as to think,
   that when he became a fugitive, he was beyond the reach of God's hand.
   What then is to flee from the face of Jehovah, except it be that which
   he here confesses, that he fled from the presence of God, as though he
   wished, like runaway servants, to reject the government of God? Since
   then Jonah was carried away by this violent temptation, there is no
   reason why we should now try, by some vain and frivolous pretenses, to
   excuse his sin. This is one thing.

   With regard to the word Tharsis, or Tharsisa, I doubt not but that it
   means Cilicia. There are those who think that it is the city Tarsus;
   but they are mistaken, for it is the name of a country. They are also
   mistaken who translate it, Sea; for Jonah intended not only to go to
   sea, but also to pass over into Cilicia, which is opposite to the
   Syrian Sea. But the Jews called that the Sea of Tarshish, as it appears
   from many passages, because there was very frequent sailing to that
   place. As then that transmarine country was more known to them than any
   other, and as they carried there their merchandise, and in their turn
   purchased their goods, they called that the Sea of Tarshish, as it is
   well known, as being near it.

   Jonah then intended to flee into Cilicia, when the Lord would have sent
   him to Nineveh. It is said that he rose up to flee, and then, that he
   went down to Joppa, that he found there a ship, which was passing over
   to Tarshish, that he paid the fare, that he went down into the ship, to
   go with them into Cilicia: [12] now by all those expressions Jonah
   intimates that he was wholly fixed in his purpose, and that it was
   necessary that he should have been brought back by a strong hand; for
   he was touched by no repentance during his journey. Many things may
   indeed come to our minds when the call of God appears to us too
   burdensome. There is none of us, when service is to be performed to
   God, who does not roll this and that in his mind: "What will be the
   issue? how wilt thou reach the place where thou expectest to be? See
   what dangers await thee." For Satan always comes forth, whenever we
   resolve to obey God; but we are to struggle in this case, and then
   repel what we see to be contrary to our calling. But Jonah shows that
   he was obstinately fixed in his purpose of fleeing: for he not only
   intended to go into Tarshish, but he actually went down to the city
   Joppa, which was nigh to Judea; and, therefore some think that Tarshish
   was Africa; but this is strained. Others divine it to be Thunetus or
   Carthage, as though indeed these cities were built at that time; but
   men are very bold in dreaming. But what need of giving a new meaning to
   this word against the most common usage of Scriptures when it is
   evident enough that Tarshish is Cilicia?

   Now, when Jonah went down to Joppa, it was evident that he intended
   immediately to migrate from the land of Judah, and to pass over the
   sea: but by saying that he paid the fare, that he went down into the
   ship, that he might go, -- by this gradual progress, he sets before us,
   as I have said, more fully his own perverseness; so that he admits that
   he not only resolutely purposed to reject the call of God, but that he
   also confirmed himself in it: and though there were many things to be
   done, which might have sometimes forced him to stand still, he yet
   constantly followed where his perverse and blind impulse led him. There
   is no doubt then, but that Jonah, in these distinct words sets himself
   forth as a fugitive, not only by one act, but by many acts.

   Now, as to his flight, we must bear in mind what I have before said --
   that all flee away from the presence of God, who do not willingly obey
   his commandments; not that they can depart farther from him, but they
   seek, as far as they can, to confine God within narrow limits, and to
   exempt themselves from being subject to his power. No one indeed openly
   confesses this; yet the fact itself shows, that no one withdraws
   himself from obedience to God's commands without seeking to diminish
   and, as it were, to take from him his power, so that he may no longer
   rule. Whosoever, then, do not willingly subject themselves to God, it
   is the same as though they would turn their backs on him and reject his
   authority that they may no more be under his power and dominion.

   It is deserving of notice, that as Jonah represents himself as guilty
   before the whole world, so he intended by his example to show how great
   and detestable a sin it is, not to submit to the commands of God, and
   not to undertake whatever he enjoins, but to evade his authority. That
   he might then enhance the atrocity of his sin, he shows by his own
   example that we cannot rebel against God, without seeking, under some
   pretense or another to thrust him from his throne, and, at the same
   time, to confine him within certain limits that he may not include
   heaven and earth within his empire.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [12] On this success of Jonah in meeting with a ship, etc., Marckius
   has these appropriate remarks --
   "God sometimes not only suffers the wicked to advance prosperously in
   their sins, but does not immediately restore the godly in their
   declensions; nay, he gives them every facility for a time in their
   downward course, in order that they may know themselves more, and that
   the glory of God may become thereby more manifest. Foolish then is the
   sinner, who, having begun life prosperously, concludes that the end
   will be equally happy." Matthew Henry's remarks are of the same import,
   but still more striking -- "Providence seemed to favor his design, and
   gave him an opportunity to escape: we may be out of the way of duty,
   and yet may meet with favorable gale. The ready way is not always the
   right way."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast not sent a Jonah to us, when
   alienated from every hope of salvation, but hast given thy Son to be
   our Teacher, clearly to show to us the way of salvation, and not only
   to call us to repentance by threatening and terrors, but also kindly to
   allure us to the hope of eternal life, and to be a pledge of thy
   paternal love, -- O grant, that we may not reject so remarkable a favor
   offered to us, but willingly and from the heart obey thee; and though
   the condition which thou settest before us in thy Gospel may seem hard,
   and though the bearing of the cross is bitter to our flesh, yet may we
   never shun to obey thee, but present ourselves to thee as a sacrifice;
   and having overcome all the hindrances of this world, may we thus
   proceed in the course of our holy calling, until we be at length
   gathered into thy celestial kingdom, under the guidance of Christ thy
   Son, our Lord. Amen.

   Jonah 1:4

   4.. But the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a
   mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.

   4. Et Jehova emisit ventum magnum super mare, et facta est tempestas
   magna in mari, et navis cogitabit frangi.


   Jonah declares here how he had been, as it were, by force brought back
   by the Lord, when he tried to flee away from his presence. He then says
   that a tempest arose in the sea; but he at the same time tells us, that
   this tempest did not arise by chance, as ungodly men are wont to say,
   who ascribe everything that happens to fortune. God, he says, sent a
   strong wind on the sea. Some give this renderings God raised up,
   deriving the verb from ntl, nuthel; but others derive it more correctly
   from tvl, tul [13] , and we shall presently meet with the same word in
   the fifth verse. Now as to what took place, he says that there was so
   great a tempest, that the ship was not far from being broken. When he
   says, The ship thought to be broken [14] the expression corresponds
   with the idiom of our language, la navire cuidoit perir But some take
   the ship for the passengers or the sailors; but this is strained; and
   we know that our common language agrees in many of its phrases with the
   Hebrew.

   Jonah then meant, that a tempest arose, not by chance, but by the
   certain purpose of God, so that being overtaken on the sea, he
   acknowledged that he had been deceived when he thought that he could
   flee away from God's presence by passing over the sea. Though indeed
   the Prophet speaks here only of one tempest, we may yet hence generally
   gather, that no storms, nor any changes in the air, which produce rain
   or stir up tempests on the sea, happen by chance, but that heaven and
   earth are so regulated by a Divine power, that nothing takes place
   without being foreseen and decreed. But if any one objects, and says
   that it does not harmonize with reason, that, for the fault of one man,
   so many suffered shipwreck, or were tossed here and there by the storm:
   the ready answer to this is, -- that though God had a regard only, in a
   special manner, to the case of Jonah, yet there were hidden reasons why
   he night justly involve others in the same danger. It is probable that
   many were then sailing; it was not one ship only that was on that sea,
   since there were so many harbors and so many islands. But though the
   Lord may involve many men in the same punishment, when he especially
   intends to pursue only one man, yet there is never wanting a reason why
   he might not call before his tribunal any one of us, even such as
   appear the most innocent. And the Lord works wonderfully, while ruling
   over men. It would be therefore preposterous to measure his operations
   by our wisdom; for God can so punish one man, as to humble some at the
   same time, and to chastise others for their various sins, and also to
   try their patience. Thus then is the mouth of ungodly men stopped, that
   they may not clamor against God, when he so executes his judgments as
   not to comport with the judgment of our flesh. But this point I shall
   presently discuss more at large: there are indeed everywhere in
   Scripture, instances in which God inflicted punishment on a whole
   people, when yet one man only had sinned. But when some murmur and
   plead that they are innocent, there is ever to be found a reason why
   God cannot be viewed as dealing cruelly with them; nay, were he
   pleased, he might justly treat them with much greater severity: in a
   word, though God may appear to deal severely with men, he yet really
   spares them, and treats them with indulgence. Let us now proceed --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [13] This is no doubt its root. It is used when Saul is said to cast a
   javelin at David, 1 Samuel 18:11, and when the Lord threatens to cast
   out the people from his land, Jeremiah 16:13. It implies force and
   power. Coverdale's rendering, as quoted by Henderson, strikingly
   conveys its meaning, "But the Lord hurled a great wynde into the sea."
   -- Ed.

   [14] This perhaps can hardly be said to be a Hebrew idiom. Marckius,
   and also Henderson, think it to be a metonymy, the ship is mentioned,
   instead of the mariners: there is in Luke 8:23 an opposite metonymy,
   the sailors are taken for the ship. Newcome renders the sentence, "and
   it was thought that the ship would be broken in pieces." If the
   metonymy be admitted, the rendering would be, "and the mariners thought
   that they should be shipwrecked." -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jonah 1:5

   5. Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and
   cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it
   of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he
   lay, and was fast asleep.

   5. Et timuerunt nautae et vociferati sunt quisque ad deum suum; et
   projecerunt vasa, quae erant in navi, in mare, ut levaretur ab illis:
   Jonas autem descenderat in latera navis, et jacebat et dormiebat.


   This narrative, in which Jonah relates in order so many circumstances,
   is not without its use; for, as we shall presently see, he intended to
   set forth his own insensibility, and to lay it before us as painted
   before our eyes: and the comparison, which is implied in the
   circumstances, greatly illustrates the supine and almost brutal
   security of Jonah.

   He says first that the mariners [15] were afraid, and then, that each
   cried, that is, to his god and that they cast out into the sea the
   lading of the ship. As then they were all so concerned, was it not
   marvelous that Jonah, on whose account the sea was stormy, was asleep?
   Others were busy, they ran here and there in the ship, and spoiled
   themselves of their goods, that they might reach the shore in safety:
   they indeed chose to strip themselves of all they had rather than to
   perish; they also cried to their gods. Jonah cared for nothing, nay, he
   lay asleep: but whence came such a carelessness as this, except that he
   was not only become torpid, but that he seemed also to have been
   deprived of all reason and common feeling? There is no doubt then but
   that Jonah, in order to show this to have been the case, has here
   enumerated so many circumstances.

   He says that the mariners were afraid. We indeed know that sailors are
   not usually frightened by small or common storms; for they are a hardy
   race of men, and they are the less afraid, because they daily see
   various commotions in the air. When, therefore, he says that the
   sailors were afraid, we hence gather that it was not a moderate
   tempest, for such does not thus terrify men accustomed by long expert
   once to all sorts of storms: they, then, who had been previously
   hardened, were disquieted with fear. He afterwards adds, that they
   cried, each of them to his god. Jonah certainly ought not to have slept
   so soundly, but that he might rouse himself at almost any moment, for
   he carried in his heart his own executioner, as he knew that he was a
   fugitive: for we have said before, that it was not a slight offense for
   Jonah to withdraw himself from the presence of God; he despised his
   call, and, as far as he could, cast off the yoke, so as not to obey
   God. Seeing, then, that Jonah was ill at ease with himself, ought he
   not to have trembled, even while asleep? But while others cried to
   their false gods, he either despised, or at least neglected the true
   God, to whom he knew he was disobedient, and against whom he rebelled.
   This is the point of the comparison, or of the antithesis. But we at
   the same time see, how in dangers men are constrained to call on God.
   Though, indeed, there is a certain impression by nature on the hearts
   of men as to God, so that every one, willing or unwilling, is conscious
   that there is some Supreme Being; we yet by our wickedness smother this
   light, which ought to shine within us. We indeed gladly cast away all
   cares and anxieties; for we wish to live at ease, and tranquillity is
   the chief good of men. Hence it comes, that all desire to live without
   fear and without care; and hence we all naturally seek quietness. Yet
   this quietness generates contempt. Hence then it is, that hardly any
   religion appears in the world, when God leaves us in an undisturbed
   condition. Fear constrains us, however unwilling, to come to God. False
   indeed is what is said, that fear is the cause of religion, and that it
   was the first reason why men thought that there were gods: this notion
   is indeed wholly inconsistent with common sense and experience. But
   religion, which has become nearly extinct, or at least covered over in
   the hearts of men, is stirred up by dangers. Of this Jonah gives a
   remarkable instance, when he says that the sailors cried, each of them
   to his god We know how barbarous is this race of men; they are disposed
   to shake off every sense of religion; they indeed drive away every
   fear, and deride God himself as long as they may. Hence that they cried
   to God, it was no doubt what necessity forced them to do. And here we
   may learn, how useful it is for us to be disquieted by fear; for while
   we are safe, torpidity, as it is well known, soon creeps over us.
   Since, then, hardly any one of himself comes to God, we have need of
   goads; and God sharply pricks us, when he brings any danger, so as to
   constrain us to tremble. But in this way, as I have already said, he
   stimulates us; for we see that all would go astray, and even perish in
   their thoughtlessness, were he not to draw them back, even against
   their own will.

   But Jonah does not simply say, that each cried to God, but he adds, to
   his own god. As, then, this passage teaches, that men are constrained
   by necessity to seek God, we also, on the other hand, it shows, that
   men go astray in seeking God, except they are directed by celestial
   truth, and also by the Spirit of God. There is then some right desire
   in men, but it goes astray; for none will keep the right way except the
   Lord directs them, as it has been said, both by his word and his
   Spirit. Both these particulars we learn from the words of the Prophet:
   The sailors feared; men hardy and almost iron-hearted, who, like the
   Cyclops, despised God, -- these, he says, were afraid; and they also
   cried to God; but they did not cry by the guidance of faith; hence it
   was, that every one cried to his own god.

   When we read this, let it first come to our minds that there is no hope
   until God constrains us, as it were, by force; but we ought to
   anticipate extreme necessity by seeking him willingly. For what did it
   avail the sailors and other passengers, to call once on God? It is
   indeed probable that, shortly after, they relapsed into their former
   ungodly indifference; after having been freed from their danger, they
   probably despised God, and all religion was regarded by them with
   contempt. And so it commonly happens as to ungodly men, who never obey
   God except when they are constrained. Let therefore every one of us
   offer himself willingly to God, even now when we are in no danger, and
   enjoy full quietness. For if we think, that any pretext for
   thoughtlessness, or for error, or for ignorance, will serve as an
   excuse, we are greatly deceived; for no excuse can be admitted, since
   experience teaches us, that there is naturally implanted in all some
   knowledge of God, and that these truths are engraven on our hearts,
   that God governs our life, -- that he alone can remove us by death, --
   that it is his peculiar office to aid and help us. For how was it that
   these sailors cried? Had they any new teacher who preached to them
   about religion, and who regularly taught them that God was the
   deliverer of mankind? By no means: but these truths, as I have said,
   had been by nature impressed on their hearts. While the sea was
   tranquil, none of them called on their god; but danger roused them from
   their drowsiness. But it is hence sufficiently evident, that whatever
   excuses they may pretend, who ascribe not to God his glory, they are
   all frivolous; for there is no need of any law, there is no need of any
   Scripture, in short, there is no need of any teaching, to enable men to
   know, that this life is in the hand of God, that deliverance is to be
   sought from him alone, and that nothing, as we have said, ought to be
   looked for from any other quarter: for invocation proves that men have
   this conviction respecting God; and invocation comes from nothing else
   but from some hidden instinct, and indeed from the guidance and
   teaching of nature, (duce ac magistra natura) This is one thing.

   But let us also learn from this passage, that when God is sought by us,
   we ought not to trust to our own understanding; for we shall in that
   case immediately go astray. God then must be supplicated to guide us by
   his word, otherwise every one will fall off into his own superstitions;
   as we here see, that each cried to his own god. The Prophet also
   reminds us that multiplicity of gods is no modern invention; for
   mankind, since the fall of Adam, have ever been prone to falsehood and
   vanity. We know how much corruption must occupy our minds, when every
   one invents for himself hideous and monstrous things. Since it is so,
   there is no wonder that superstitions have ever prevailed in the world;
   for the wit of man is the workshop of all errors. (quia ingenium
   hominis officina est omnium errorum) And hence also we may learn what I
   have lately touched upon, -- that nothing is worse for us than to
   follow the impulses of our flesh; for every one of himself advances in
   the way of error, even without being pushed on by another; and at the
   same time, as is commonly the case, men draw on one another.

   He now adds, that the wares were cast out, that is, the lading of the
   ship; and we know that this is the last resource in shipwrecks; for
   men, to save their lives, will deprive themselves willingly of all
   their goods. We hence see how precious is life to man; for he will not
   hesitate to strip himself of all he has, that he may not lose his life.
   We indeed shun want, and many seek death because extreme poverty is
   intolerable to them; but when they come to some great danger, men ever
   prefer their life to all their possessions; for what are the good
   things of this world, but certain additions to our life? But Jonah
   tells us for another purpose that the ship was lightened, even for
   this, -- that we may know that the tempest was no ordinary commotion,
   but that the sailors, apprehensive of approaching death, adopted this
   as the last resource.

   Another clause follows: Jonah had gone down into the sides [16] , or
   the side, of the ship. Jonah no doubt sought a retreat before the storm
   arose. As soon then as they sailed from the harbor, Jonah withdrew to
   some remote corner, that he might sleep there. But this was no
   excusable insensibility on his part, as he knew that he was a fugitive
   from the presence of God: he ought then to have been agitated by
   unceasing terrors; nay, he ought to have been to himself the taxer
   (exactor) of anxiety. But it often so happens, that when any one has
   sought hiding-places, he brings on himself a stupor almost brutal; he
   thinks of nothing, he cares for nothing, he is anxious for nothing.
   Such then was the insensibility which possessed the soul of Jonah, when
   he went down to some recess in the ship, that he might there indulge
   himself in sleep. Since it thus happened to the holy Prophet, who of us
   ought not to fear for himself? Let us hence learn to remind ourselves
   often of God's tribunal; and when our minds are seized with torpor, let
   us learn to stimulate and examine ourselves, lest God's judgment
   overwhelm us while asleep. For what prevented ruin from wholly
   swallowing up Jonah, except the mercy of God, who pitied his servant,
   and watched for his safety even while he was asleep? Had not the Lord
   then exercised such care over Jonah, he must have perished. [17]

   We hence see that the Lord often cares for his people when they care
   not for themselves, and that he watches while they are asleep: but this
   ought not to serve to nourish our self-indulgence; for every one of us
   is already more indulgent to himself than he ought to be: but, on the
   contrary, this example of Jonah, whom we see to have been so near
   destruction, ought to excite and urge us, that when any of us has gone
   astray from his calling he may not lie secure in that state, but, on
   the contrary, run back immediately to God. And if God be not able to
   draw us back to himself without some violent means, let us at least
   follow in this respect the example of Jonah, which we shall in its own
   place notice. It follows --

   Jonah 1:6

   6. So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou,
   O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon
   us, that we perish not.

   6. Et accessit ad eum magister funis, et dixit ei, Quid tibi, sopite?
   Surge, clama ad Deum tuum, si forte serenum se exhibeat Deus nobis
   (alii vertunt, cogitet de nobis, vel gratificetur nobis,) et non
   pereamus.


   Jonah relates here how he was reproved by the pilot or master of the
   ship [18] , inasmuch as he alone slept, while all the rest were in
   anxiety and fear. "What meanest thou, fast sleeper?" The pilot no doubt
   upbraids Jonah for his sleepiness, and reproves him for being almost
   void of all thought and reflection. What meanest thou, fast sleeper
   [19] , he says; when thou sees all the rest smitten with alarm, how
   canst thou sleep? Is not this unnatural? Rise, then, and call on thy
   God

   We see that where there is no rule of faith a liberty is commonly
   taken, so that every one goes astray here and there. Whence was it,
   that the pilot said to Jonah, Call on thy God, and that he did not
   confine him to any certain rule? Because it had been customary in all
   ages for men to be satisfied with some general apprehension of God; and
   then every one according to his own fancy formed a god for himself: nor
   could it have been otherwise, as I have said, while men were not
   restrained by any sacred bond. All agree as to this truth, that there
   is some God, and also that no dead idol can do anything, but that the
   world is governed by the providence and power of God, and further, that
   safety is to be sought from him. All this, has been received by the
   common consent of all; but when we come to particulars, then every one
   is in the dark; how God is to be sought they know not. Hence every one
   takes his own liberty: "For the sake of appeasing God I will then try
   this; this shall be my mode of securing his favor; the Lord will regard
   this service acceptable; in this way shall all my iniquity be expiated,
   that I may obtain favor with God." Thus each invents for themselves
   some tortuous way to come to God; and then every one forms a god
   peculiar to himself. There can therefore be no stability nor
   consistency in men, unless they are joined together by some bond, even
   by some certain rule of religion, so that they may not vacillate, and
   not be in doubt as to what is right to be done, but be assured and
   certainly persuaded, that there is but one true God, and know what sort
   of God he is, and then understand the way by which he is to be sought.

   We then learn from this passage, that there is an awful license taken
   in fictitious religions, and that all who are carried away by their
   fancy are involved in a labyrinth, so that men do nothing but weary and
   torment themselves in vain, when they seek God without understanding
   the right way. They indeed run with all their might, but they go
   farther and farther from God. But that they, at the same time, form in
   their minds an idea of some God, and that they agree on this great
   principle, is sufficiently evident from the second clause of this
   verse, If so be that God will be Propitious to us. Here the pilot
   confines not his discourse to the God of Jonah, but speaks simply of a
   God; for though the world by their differences divide God, and Jonah
   worshipped a God different from the rest, and, in short, there was
   almost an endless number of gods among the passengers, yet the pilot
   says, If so be that God, etc.: now then he acknowledges some Supreme
   God, though each of them had his own god. We hence see that what I have
   said is most true, -- that this general truth has ever been received
   with the consent of all, -- that the world is preserved by the
   providence of God, and hence that the life and safety of men are in his
   hand. But as they are very far removed from God, and not only creep
   slowly, but are also more inclined to turn to the earth than to look up
   to heaven, and are uncertain and ever change, so they seek gods which
   are nigh to them, and when they find none, they hesitate not to invent
   them.

   We have elsewhere seen that the Holy Spirit uses this form of speaking,
   If so be, when no doubt, but difficulty alone is intended. It is
   however probable, that the pilot in this case was perplexed and
   doubtful, as it is usual with ungodly men, and that he could determine
   nothing certain as to any help from God; and as his mind was thus
   doubtful, he says, that every means of relief were to be tried. And
   here, as in a mirror, we may see how miserable is the condition of all
   those who call not on God in pure faith: they indeed cry to God, for
   the impulse of nature thus leads them; but they know not whether they
   will obtain any thing by their cries: they repeat their prayers; but
   they know not whether they pass off into air or really come to God. The
   pilot owns, that his mind was thus doubtful, If so be that God will be
   propitious to us, call thou also on thy God. Had he been so surely
   convinced, as to call on the true God, he would have certainly found it
   to have been no doubtful relief. However, that nothing might be left
   untried, he exhorted Jonah, that if he had a God, to call upon him. We
   hence see, that there are strange windings, when we do not understand
   the right way. Men would rather run here and there, a hundred times,
   through earth and heaven, than come to God, except where his word
   shines. How so? because when they make the attempt, an insane impulse
   drives them in different ways; and thus they are led here and there:
   "It may be, that this may be useful to me; as that way has not
   succeeded, I will try another." God then thus punishes all the
   unbelieving, who obey not his word; for to the right way they do not
   keep: He indeed shows how great a madness it is, when men give loose
   reins to their imaginations, and do not submit to celestial truth.

   As to the words, interpreters translate them in different ways. Some
   say, "If so be that God will think of us;" others "If so be that God
   will favor us. st, oshit, is properly to shine; but when put as here in
   the conjugation Hithpael, it means to render one's self clear or
   bright: and it is a metaphor very common in Scriptures that the face of
   God is cloudy or dark, when he is not propitious to us; and again, God
   is said to make bright his face and to appear serene to us, when he
   really shows himself kind and gracious to us. As then this mode of
   speaking altogether suits this place, I wonder that some seek
   extraneous interpretations. [20]

   He afterwards adds, Lest we perish. Here the pilot clearly owns, that
   he thought the life of man to be in the power of God; for he concluded,
   that they must perish unless the Lord brought aid. Imprinted then in
   the minds of all is this notion or prolepsis, that is, preconception,
   that when God is angry or adverse, we are miserable, and that near
   destruction impends over us; and another conviction is found to be in
   the hearts of men, -- that as soon as the Lord looks on us, his favor
   and goodwill brings to us immediate safety. The Holy Spirit does not
   speak here, but a heathen, and we know too how great is the impiety of
   sailors, and yet he declares this by the impulse of nature, and there
   is here no feigning; for God, as I have already said, extorts by
   necessity a confession from the unbelieving, which they would gladly
   avoid.

   Now what excuse can we have, if we think our safety to be in our own
   hands, if we depend not wholly on God, and if we neglect him in
   prosperity, as though we could be safe without his help? These words
   then, spoken by the sailor, ought to be weighed by us, If so be that
   God's face may appear bright to us, and that we perish not. [21] It now
   follows --

   thou art fast asleep?" -- Henderson. "What ails thee? Sleeping!" --
   Benjoin. The first pare is well rendered by the last author, but not
   the other; for mdrn, only found as a verb in Niphal, ever means a deep
   sleep. It is applied to Sisera, in Jael's tent, Judges 4:21, and to the
   sleep of death, Psalm 76:6. The rendering then ought to be, "What ails
   thee? Being fast asleep." -- Ed.

   [20] Calvin is quite right here. The verb tsty occurs only here in
   Hithpael; and once as a verb in Kal, Jeremiah 5:28, vts, they "shine,"
   applied to fat men, and once as a participle, applied to iron, tvs
   lzrv, "bright iron," or iron brightened, or made to shine, Ezekiel
   27:19. It occurs as a noun in three other places, ts, Canticles 5:14,
   tvts in Job 12:5, and tvchs in Psalm 146:4. The idea of shining,
   brightness, or splendor, comports better with the context than that of
   thought, as given in our version in the two last places. It occurs once
   in its Chaldec form in Daniel 6:3, and there, no doubt, it means
   thought, or intention, or design. Following the usual import of the
   Hithpael conjugation, we may render the word here, "It may be, that God
   will himself shine upon us;" which means "will show himself gracious to
   us." The Septuagint gives the sense, but not the ideal meaning of the
   verb, diasose, may save, and so does Pagininus, placeatur -- may be

   Jonah 1:7

   7. And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots,
   that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast
   lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.

   7. Et dixit vir (hoc est, quisque) ad socium suum, Venite et jaciamus
   sortes, ut sciamus ob quam causam [22] malum hoc nobis: et jecerunt
   sortes, et cecidit sors super Jonam.


   Jonah did not without reason mention this, -- that the passengers
   consulted together about casting lots; for we hence learn, that it was
   no ordinary tempest: it appeared then to be a token of God's wrath.
   For, if strong wind arose, it would not have been so strange, for such
   had been often the case; and if a tempest followed, it would not have
   been a thing unusual. It must then have been something more dreadful,
   as it filled men's minds with alarms so that they were conscious that
   God was present as an avenger: and we know, that it is not common with
   ungodly men to recognize the vengeance of Gods except in extreme
   dangers; but when God executes punishment on sins in an unusual manner,
   then men begin to acknowledge God's vengeance.

   This very thing, Jonah now bears witness to, They said then each to his
   friend, Come, let us cast lots. Was it not an accustomed thing for them
   to cast lots whenever a tempest arose? By no means. They had recourse,
   no doubt, to this expedient, because they knew, that God had not raised
   up that tempest without some very great and very serious cause. This is
   one thing: but I cannot now pursue the subjects, I must therefore defer
   it until tomorrow.

   Grant, Almighty God, that though we are here disquieted in the midst of
   so many tossings, we may yet learn with tranquil minds to recumb on thy
   grace and promise, by which thou testifiest that thou wilt be ever near
   us, and not wait until by a strong hand thou drawest us to thyself, but
   that we may be, on the contrary, ever attentive to thy providence: may
   we know that our life not only depends on a thread, but also vanishes
   like the smoke, unless thou protectest it, so that we may recumb wholly
   on thy power; and may we also, while in a cheerful and quiet state, so
   call on thee, that relying on thy protection we may live in safety, and
   at the same time be careful, lest torpor, which draws away our minds
   and thoughts from meditating on the divine life, should creep over us,
   but may we, on the contrary, so earnestly seek thee, morning and
   evening, and at all times, that we may through life advance towards the
   mark thou hast set before us, until we at length reach that heavenly
   kingdom, which Christ thy Son has obtained for us by his own blood.
   Amen

   Lecture Seventy-fourth.

   We said in yesterday's lecture, that it was a proof of extreme fear,
   that the sailors and the rest cast lots; for this is not usually done,
   except men see themselves to be destitute of judgment and counsel.

   But it must at the same time be observed, that through error they cast
   lots: for they did not know, that if God intended to punish each of
   them, they were worthy even of heavier punishment. They would not
   indeed have thrown the blame on one man, if each had well considered
   what he deserved before God. When a calamity happens, it is the duty of
   every one to examine himself and his whole life before God: then every
   one, from the first to the last, must confess that he bears a just
   judgment. But when all demand together who is guilty before God, they
   thus exonerate themselves, as though they were innocent. And it is an
   evil that prevails at this day in the world, that every one is disposed
   to cast the blame on others and all would have themselves to be
   innocent before God; not that they can clear themselves of every fault,
   but they extenuate their sins, as though God could not justly pursue
   them with so much severity. As for instance, when any one perceives
   that he had in various ways done wrong, he will indeed confess in words
   that he is a sinner; but were any person to enumerate and bring forward
   each of his sins he would say, "This is a light offense, that is a
   venal sin; and the Lord deals not with us with so much strict justice,
   that he means to bring on us instantly extreme punishment." When there
   is a slight offense, it is immediately referred to by every one. Thus
   acted the sailors, of whom Jonah now speaks. Had any one asked, whether
   they were wholly without fault, every one, no doubt, would have
   confessed that he was a sinner before God; but yet they cast lots as
   though one only was exposed to God's judgment. How so? because they did
   not think that their own sins deserved so heavy a punishment. How much
   soever they might have offended, -- and this they really felt and were
   convinced of, -- they yet did not make so much of their sins as to
   think that they deserved any such judgment. This then is the reason why
   they come to the lot; it was, because every one seemed to himself to be
   blameless when he came to examine himself.

   This passage, then, shows what is even well known by common experience,
   -- that men, though they know themselves to be guilty before God, yet
   extenuate their sins and promise themselves pardon, as though they
   could make an agreement with God, that he should not treat them with
   strict justice, but deal with them indulgently. Hence, then, is the
   hope of impunity, because we make light offenses of the most grievous
   sins. Thus we find under the Papacy, that various modes are devised, by
   which they absolve themselves before God and wipe away their stains:
   the sprinkling of holy water cleanses almost all sins; except a man be
   either an adulterer, or a murderer, or a sorcerer, or ten times
   perjured, he hardly thinks himself to be guilty of any crime. Then the
   expiations which they use, avail, as they think, to obliterate all
   iniquities. Whence is this error? Even because they consider God to be
   like themselves, and think not their sins to be so great abominations
   before God. But this is no new thing; for we see what happened in the
   time of Jonah; and from profane histories also we may learn, that this
   error possessed everywhere the minds of all. They had then daily
   expiations, as the Papists have their masses, their pilgrimages, their
   sprinklings of holy water, and similar playthings (nugas -- trifles,
   fopperies): but as under the Papacy there are reserved cases, so also
   in former times, when any one had killed a father or mother, when any
   one had committed incest, he stood in need of some extraordinary
   expiation; and if there was any one of great renown on the earth, they
   applied to him, that he might find out some new kind of expiation. An
   example of this error is set before us here, when they said, let us
   cast lots. For except they thought that one only was guilty, and not
   and every one would have publicly confessed his sins, and would then
   have acknowledged that such was the mass of them as to be enough to
   fill heaven and earth; but this they did not. One man must have been
   the offender; but no one came forward with such a confession: hence
   they cast lots.

   It may now be inquired, whether this mode of seeking out the truth was
   lawful; as they knew not through whose fault the tempest arose, was it
   right to have recourse to lots? Some have been too superstitious in
   condemning lots; for they have plainly said, that all lots are wicked.
   Hence has come the name, lot-drawers; (sortilegi) and they have thought
   that lot-drawers differ nothing from magicians and enchanters. This has
   proceeded from ignorance, for we know that the casting of lots has been
   sometimes allowed. And Solomon certainly speaks, as of a common rule,
   when he says of lots being cast into the bosom, and of the issue being
   from Jehovah (Proverbs 16:33.) Solomon speaks not there of the arts of
   magic but says that when lots are cast, the event is not by chance but
   by God's providence. And when Matthias was chosen in the place of
   Judas, it was done by lot, (Acts 1:26.) Did the Apostles use this mode
   presumptuously? No, the Holy Spirit presided over this election. There
   is then no doubt but that God approved of that casting of lots. So also
   Joshua had recourse to the lot when the cause of God's displeasure was
   unknown, though it was evident that God was angry with the people.
   Joshua, being perplexed by what was unknown, did cast lots; and so
   Achan was discovered and his sacrilege. That lot no one will dare
   condemn. Then what I have said is clear enough, that those have been
   too superstitious who have condemned all casting of lots without
   exception. But we must yet remember that lots are not to be used
   indiscriminately. It is a part of the civil law, that when a common
   inheritance is divided, it is allowed to cast lots: as it belongs not
   to this or that person to choose, each must take the part which the lot
   determines. So again it is lawful to cast lot in great undertakings,
   when men are anywhere sent: and when there is a division of labor, to
   prevent jealousy when one wishes to choose a certain part for himself,
   the lot will remove all contentions. A lot of this kind is allowed both
   by the word of God, and by civil laws. But when any one adopts the lot
   without any reason, he is no doubt superstitious, and differs not much
   from the magician or the enchanter. As for instance, when one intends
   to go a journey, or to take anything in hand, if he throws into his hat
   a white and a black lot, and says, "I will see whether my going out
   today will be prosperous;" now this is of the devil; for Satan by such
   arts deludes wretched men. If then any one makes use of the lot without
   any just reason, he is, as I have said without excuse.

   But as to the other lots, such as we have now noticed, they ought not
   to be viewed as precedents. For though Joshua used the lot to bring to
   light the cause for which God was angry with his people, it is not yet
   right for us to imitate what he did; for Joshua was no doubt led by
   some peculiar influence to adopt this measure. So also as to Saul, when
   he cast lots, and his son Jonathan was discovered as the one who had
   tasted honey, it was an especial example. The same thing must be also
   said of the lot mentioned here; for as the sailors were trembling, and
   knew not the cause why the tempest arose, and the fear of shipwreck
   seized them, they had recourse to the lot. Were we continually to
   imitate such examples, such a liberty would not certainly be pleasing,
   to God, nor consistent with his word. We must therefore bear in mind,
   that there were some peculiar influences, whenever God's servants used
   the lot in doubtful and extreme cases [23] . This then is shortly the
   answer to the question -- Was it lawful for the sailors to cast lots,
   that they might find out the person on account of whom they were in so
   much danger? I now proceed to what follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [23] Similar is the view given by Jerome. "We ought not, for this
   example, to put implicit confidence in lots, nor to connect with it the
   instance recorded in the Acts, when Matthias was chosen an Apostle by
   lot, since privileges granted to individuals cannot make a common rule,
   (cum privilegia singulorum non possint legem facere communem.")

   Jonah 1:8-10

   8. Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this
   evil is upon us; What is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what
   is thy country? and of what people art thou?

   8. Et dixerunt ei, Narra nunc nobis quare malum hoc nobis contingerit,
   quodnam opus tuum et unde venias, quae sit patria tua, et ex quo
   populosis?

   9. And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the Lord, the God
   of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land

   9. Et dixit ad eos Hebraeus ego sum, et Jehovam Deum coelorum ego
   timeo, qui fecit mare et aridam.

   10. Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, Why hast
   thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the
   Lord, because he had told them.

   10. Et timuerunt viri timore magno, et dixerunt ei, Quare hoc fecisti?
   Quia noverant viri quod a facie Jehovae ipse fugeret; nam ipsis
   narraverat.


   After the lot fell on Jonah, they doubted not but that he was the
   guilty person, any more than if he had been a hundred times proved to
   be so: for why did they cast lots, except that they were persuaded that
   all doubt could thus be removed, and that what was hid could thus be
   brought to the light? As then this persuasion was fixed in their minds,
   that the truth was elicited, and was in a manner drawn out of darkness
   by the lot, they now inquire of Jonah what he had done: for they took
   this as allowed, that they had to endure the tempest on his account,
   and also, that he, by some detestable crime, had merited such a
   vengeance at Gods hand. We hence see that they cast lots, because they
   fully believed that they could not otherwise find out the crime on
   account of which they suffered, and also, that lots were directed by
   the hidden purpose of God: for how could a certain judgment be found by
   lot, except God directed it according to his own purpose, and overruled
   what seemed to be especially fortuitous? These principles then were
   held as certain in a manner by men who were heathens, -- that God can
   draw out the truth, and bring it to the light, -- and also, that he
   presides over lots, however fortuitous they may be thought to be.

   This was the reason why they now asked what Jonah had done. Tell us,
   then, why has this evil happened to us, what is thy work? etc. By work
   here I do not mean what is wrong, but a kind of life, or, as they say,
   a manner of living. They then asked how Jonah had hitherto employed
   himself, and what sort of life he followed. For it afterwards follows,
   Tell us, whence comest thou, what is thy country, and from what people
   art thou? They made inquiries, no doubt, on each particular in due
   order; but Jonah here briefly records the questions.

   I now come to his answer, He said to them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear
   Jehovah the God of heaven, Who has created the sea and the dry land
   [24] Here Jonah seemed as yet to evade, yea, to disown his crime, for
   he professed himself to be the worshipper of the true God. Who would
   not have said, but that he wished here to escape by a subterfuge, as he
   set up his own piety to cover the crime before-mentioned? But all
   things are not here in the first verse related; for shortly after, it
   follows, that the sailors knew of Jonah's flight; and that he had
   himself told them, that he had disobeyed God's call and command. There
   is then no doubt but that Jonah honestly confessed his own sin, though
   he does not say so. But we know, that it is a mode of speaking common
   among the Hebrews to add in the last place what had been first said;
   and grammarians say, that it is husteron proteron, (last first,) when
   anything is left out in its proper place and then added as an
   explanation. When therefore Jonah says that he was an Hebrew, and
   worshipper of the true God, -- this tended to aggravate his fault or
   crime rather than to excuse it: for had he said only, that he was
   conscious of having done wrong in disobeying God, his crime would not
   have appeared so atrocious; but when he begins by sayings that known to
   him was the true God, the framer of heaven and earth, the God of
   Israel, who had made himself known by a law given and published, --
   when Jonah made this introduction, he thereby removed from himself all
   pretenses as to ignorance and misconception. He had been educated in
   the law, and had, from childhood, been taught who the true God was. He
   could not then have fallen through ignorance; and further, he did not,
   as the others, worship fictitious gods; he was an Israelite. As then he
   had been brought up in true religion, his sin was the more atrocious,
   inasmuch as he had fallen away from God, having despised his command,
   and, as it were, shaken off the yoke, and had become a fugitive.

   We now then perceive the reason why Jonah called himself here an
   Hebrew, and testified that he was the worshipper of the true God.
   First, by saying that he was an Hebrew, he distinguished the God of
   Abraham from the idols of the Gentiles: for the religion of the chosen
   people was well known in all places, though disapproved by universal
   consent; at the same time, the Cilicians and other Asiatics, and also
   the Grecians, and the Syrians in another quarter, -- all these knew
   what the Israelites gloried in, -- that the true God had appeared to
   their father Abraham, and then made with him a gratuitous covenant, and
   also had given the law by Moses; -- all this was sufficiently known by
   report. Hence Jonah says now, that he was an Hebrew, as though he had
   said, that he had no concern with any fictitious god, but with the God
   of Abraham, who had formerly appeared to the holy Fathers, and who had
   also given a perpetual testimony of his will by Moses. We see then how
   emphatically he declared, that he was an Hebrew: secondly, he adds, I
   fear Jehovah the God of heaven. By the word fear is meant worship: for
   it is not to be taken here as often in other places, that is, in its
   strict meaning; but fear is to be understood for worship: "I am not
   given", he says, "to various superstitions, but I have been taught in
   true religion; God has made himself known to me from my childhood: I
   therefore do not worship any idol, as almost all other people, who
   invent gods for themselves; but I worship God, the creator of heaven
   and earth." He calls him the God of heaven, that is, who dwells alone
   as God in heaven. While the others thought heaven to be filled with a
   great number of gods, Jonah here sets up against them the one true God,
   as though he said, "Invent according to your own fancy innumerable
   gods, there is yet but one, who possesses the highest authority in
   heaven; for it is he who made the sea and the dry land. [25] "

   We now then apprehend what Jonah meant by these words: he shows here
   that it was no wonder that God pursued him with so much severity; for
   he had not committed a slight offense, but a fatal sin. We now see how
   much Jonah had profited since the Lord had begun severely to deal with
   him: for inasmuch as he was asleep yea, and insensible in his sin, he
   would have never repented had it not been for this violent remedy. But
   when the Lord roused him by his severity, he then not only confessed
   that he was guilty, or owned his guilt in a formal manner, (defunctorie
   -- as ridding one's self of a business, carelessly;) but also willingly
   testified, as we see, before men who were heathens, that he was the
   guilty man, who had forsaken the true God, in whose worship he had been
   well instructed. This was the fruit of true penitence, and it was also
   the fruit of the chastisement which God had inflicted on him. If then
   we wish God to approve of our repentance, let us not seek evasions, as
   for the most part is the case; nor let us extenuate our sins, but by a
   free confession testify before the whole world what we have deserved.

   It then follows, that the men feared with great fear, and said, Why
   hast thou done this? [26] for they knew that he had fled from the
   presence of Jehovah, for he had told them. And this is not unimportant
   -- that the sailors feared with great fear: for Jonah means that they
   were not only moved by what he said, but also terrified, so that they
   gave to the true God his glory. We indeed know that superstitious men
   almost trifle with their own idols. They often entertain, it is true,
   strange fears, but afterwards they flatter themselves, and in a manner
   cajole their own hearts, so that they can pleasantly and sweetly smile
   at their own fancies. But Jonah, by saying here that they feared with
   great fear, means that they were so smitten, that they really perceived
   that the God of Israel was a righteous judge, and that he was not such
   as other nations fancied him to be, but that he was capable of
   affording dreadful examples whenever he intended to execute his
   vengeance. We hence see what Jonah means, when he speaks of great fear.
   At the same time, two things ought to be noticed, -- that they feared,
   because it was easy for them to conclude from the Prophet's words, that
   the God of Israel was the only creator of heaven and earth, -- and
   then, that it was a great fear, which, as I have said, must be
   considered as serious dread, since the fear which the unbelieving have
   soon vanishes.

   But with regard to the reproof which the sailors and other passengers
   gave to Jonah, the Lord returned to him this as a reward which he had
   deserved. He had fled from the presence of God; he had thus, as we have
   said taken away from God his supreme power: for what becomes of God's
   authority when any one of us rejects his commands and flees away from
   his presence? Since Jonah then sought to shun God, he was now placed
   before men. There were present heathens, and even barbarians, who
   rebuked him for his sin, who were his censors and judges. And the same
   thing we see happening often. For they who do not willingly obey God
   and his word, afterwards abandon themselves to many flagrant sins, and
   their baseness becomes evident to all. As, then, they cannot bear God
   to be their Master and Teacher, they are constrained to bear
   innumerable censors; for they are branded by the reproaches of the
   vulgar, they are pointed at every where by the finger, at length they
   are conducted to the gallows, and the executioner becomes their chief
   teacher. The case was similar, as we see, with Jonah: the pilot had
   before reproved his torpor, when he said, Do thou also call on thy God;
   what meanest thou, O sleeper? thou liest down here like a log of wood,
   and yet thou sees us perplexed and in extreme danger. As, then, the
   pilot first so sharply inveighed against Jonah, and then all reproved
   him with one mouth, we certainly find that he was made subject to the
   condemnation of all, because he tried to deprive God of his supreme
   power. If at any time the same thing should happen to us, if God should
   subject us to the reproaches of men when we seek to avoid his judgment,
   let us not wonder. But as Jonah here calmly answers, and raises no
   clamor, and shows no bitterness, so let every one of us, in the true
   spirit of meekness, acknowledge our own sins; when charged with them,
   were even children our condemners, or were even the most contemptible
   of the people to rise up against us, let us patiently bear all this;
   and let us know that these kinds of censors befall us through the
   providence of God. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [24] This answer reverses the order of the questions. He answers the
   last question first. "Whence comest thou, and what is thy country?" The
   answer is, "I am Hebrew." The previous question was, "What is thy
   work," or occupation? To this he answers, "I fear Jehovah," etc. This
   was his calling, his work, his occupation. "Fear," of course, includes
   worship and service. This ought to be the work and occupation of all.
   But to the first question, as to what evil he had done, he gives no
   answer. Calvin supposes that the whole is not here related, but is to
   be gathered from what follows. It is, however, probable that he had
   previously told them, that is, before the storm arose, that he was
   fleeing from the presence of the Lord: he therefore left them to
   conclude what evil it was which he had done. It may be inquired why he
   said that he was "Hebrew," and not that he was an Israelite, as the
   case really was, for he belonged to the ten tribes, and not to the
   kingdom of Judah; and Israelites, and not Hebrews seem to have been
   then the common name of the ten tribes. The reason may be, that as the
   Israelites were then for the most part idolatrous, he wished to show
   that he was a true descendant of the patriarchs, who were God's
   faithful servants, real Hebrews, passengers, sojourners, and pilgrims,
   as the word imparts, on the earth. -- Ed.

   [25] "Non Deos quos invocatis, et qui salvare non possunt, sed Deum
   coeli qui mare fecit et aridam, mare in quo fugio, aridam de qua
   fugio," etc. -- Jerome.

   [26] mh-z't syt, -- "What this thou hast done?" "ti touto epoiesas --
   what this thou hast done?" -- Sept. "Quid (i.e., cur) hoc fecisti --
   why hast thou done this?" -- Marckius; so Jerome, and Drusius, and
   Dathius. "What is this thou hast done?" -- Henderson. It is not a
   question, requiring a reason for what he had done, but rather an
   exclamation -- "What an evil is this which thou has done!" They judged
   of it by the effects; for they knew before that he had fled from the
   presence of the Lord; and now they perceived how great an evil it was.

   Jonah 1:11-12

   11. Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea
   may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous.

   11. Et dixerunt ad eum, Quid faciemus tibi ut resideat mare a nobis?
   Quia mare ibat (id est, commovebatur,) et erat tempestuosum.

   12. And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea;
   so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this
   great tempest is upon you.

   12. Et dixit illis, Tollite me, et projicite me in mare, et residebit
   mare a vobis; quia novi ego, quod propter me tempestas magna haec
   contingerit super vos (hoc est, sit super vos.)


   The sailors asked counsel of Jonah; and hence it appears that they were
   touched with so much fear as not to dare to do any thing to him. We
   hence see how much they had improved almost in an instant, since they
   spared an Israelite, because they acknowledged that among that people
   the true God was worshipped, the supreme King of heaven and earth: for,
   without a doubt, it was this fear that restrained them from throwing
   Jonah immediately into the sea. For since it was certain that through
   his fault God was displeased with them all, why was it that they did
   not save themselves by such an expiation? That they then delayed in so
   great a danger, and dared not to lay hold instantly on Jonah, was an
   evident proof that they were restrained, as I have said, by the fear of
   God.

   They therefore inquire what was to be done, What shall we do to thee,
   that the sea may be still to us? [27] for the sea was going, etc. By
   going Jonah means, that the sea was turbulent: for the sea is said to
   rest when it is calm, but when it is turbulent, then it is going, and
   has various movements and tossings. The sea, then, was going and very
   tempestuous [28] We hence see that God was not satisfied with the
   disgrace of Jonah, but he purposed to punish his offense still more. It
   was necessary that Jonah should be led to the punishment which he
   deserved, though afterwards, he was miraculously delivered from death,
   as we shall see in its proper place.

   Jonah then answers, Take me, and throw me into the sea, and it will be
   still to you. It may be asked whether Jonah ought to have of his own
   accord offered himself to die; for it seemed to be an evidence of
   desperation. He might, indeed, have surrendered himself to their will;
   but here he did, as it were, stimulate them, "Throw me into the sea,"
   he says; "for ye cannot otherwise pacify God than by punishing me." He
   seemed like a man in despair, when he would thus advance to death of
   his own accord. But Jonah no doubt knew that he was doomed to
   punishment by God. It is uncertain whether he then entertained a hope
   of deliverance, that is, whether he confidently relied at this time on
   the grace of God. But, however it may have been, we may yet conclude,
   that he gave himself up to death, because he knew and was fully
   persuaded that he was in a manner summoned by the evident voice of God.
   And thus there is no doubt but that he patiently submitted to the
   judgment which the Lord had allotted to him. Take me, then, and throw
   me into the sea

   Then he adds, The sea will be to you still Here Jonah not only declares
   that God would be pacified by his death, because the lot had fallen
   upon him, but he also acknowledges that his death would suffice as an
   expiation, so that the tempest would subside: and then the reason
   follows -- I know, he says, that on my account is this great tempest
   come upon you. When he says that he knew this, he could not refer to
   the lot, for that knowledge was common to them all. But Jonah speaks
   here by the prophetic spirit: and he no doubt confirms what I have
   before referred to, -- that the God of Israel was the supreme and only
   King of heaven and earth. This certainty of knowledge, then, of which
   Jonah speaks, must be referred to his own consciences and to the
   teaching of that religion in which he had been instructed.

   And now we may learn from these words a most useful instruction: Jonah
   does not here expostulate with God, nor contumeliously complain that
   God punished him too severely, but he willingly bears his charged guilt
   and his punishment, as he did before when he said, "I am the worshipper
   of the true God." How could he confess the true God, whose great
   displeasure he was then experiencing? But Jonah, we see, was so
   subdued, that he failed not to ascribe to God his just honor; though
   death was before his eyes, though God's wrath was burning, we yet see,
   that he gave to God, as we have said, the honor due to him. So the same
   thing is repeated in this place, Behold, he says, I know that on my
   account has this great tempest happened He who takes to himself all the
   blame, does not certainly murmur against God. It is then a true
   confession of repentance, when we acknowledge God, and willingly
   testify before men that he is just, though, according to the judgment
   of our flesh, he may deal violently with us. When however we give to
   him the praise due to his justice, we then really show our penitence;
   for unless God's wrath brings us down to this humble state of mind, we
   shall be always full of bitterness; and, however silent we may be for a
   time, our heart will be still perverse and rebellious. This humility,
   then, always follows repentance, -- the sinner prostrates himself
   before God, and willingly admits his own sin, and tries not to escape
   by subterfuges.

   And it was no wonder that Jonah thus humbled himself; for we see that
   the sailors did the same: when they said that lots were to be cast,
   they added at the same time, "Come ye and let us cast lots, that we may
   know why this evil has happened to us." They did not accuse God, but
   constituted him the Judge; and thus they acknowledged that he inflicted
   a just punishment. And yet every one thought himself to have been
   innocent; for however conscience might have bitten them, still no one
   considered himself to have been guilty of so great a wickedness as to
   subject him to God's vengeance. Though, then, the sailors thought
   themselves exempt from any great sin, they yet did not contend with
   God, but allowed him to be their Judge. Since then they, who were so
   barbarous, confined themselves within these bounds of modesty, it was
   no wonder that Jonah, especially when he was roused and began to feel
   his guilt, and was also powerfully restrained by God's hand, -- it was
   no wonder that he now confessed that he was guilty before God, and that
   he justly suffered a punishment so heavy and severe. We ought then to
   take special notice of this, -- that he knew that on his account the
   storm happened or that the sea was so tempestuous against them all. The
   rest we defer until tomorrow.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God that as thou urgest us daily to repentance and each
   of us is also stung with the consciousness of his own sins, -- grant,
   that we may not grow stupid in our vices, nor deceive ourselves with
   empty flatteries, but that each of us may, on the contrary carefully
   examine his own life and then with one mouth and heart confess that we
   are all guilty not only of light offenses, but of such as deserve
   eternal death, and that no other relief remains for us but thine
   infinite mercy and that we may so seek to become partakers of that
   grace which has been once offered to us by thy Son, and is daily
   offered to us by his Gospel, that, relying on him as our Mediator, we
   may not cease to entertain hope even in the midst of thousand deaths,
   until we be gathered into that blessed life, which has been procured
   for us by the blood of thy only Son. Amen.

   Jonah 1:13-14

   13. Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they
   could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them.

   13. Et quaerebant (vel, moliebantur, proprie est fodiebant) viri ut
   reducerent navem, et non poterant; quia mare ibat et turbulentum erat
   super eos.

   14. Wherefore they cried unto the Lord, and said, We beseech thee, O
   Lord, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay
   not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O Lord, hast done as it pleased
   thee.

   14. Et clamaverunt ad Jehovam, et dixerunt, Obsecro, Jehova, ne quaeso,
   pereamus propter animam viri hujus, et ne des super nos (hoc est, ne
   ponas) sanguinem innocentem; quia, tu Jehova, sicuti placitum tibi est,
   fecisti.


   This verse shows that the sailors and the rest were more inclined to
   mercy, when they saw that the holy Prophet was willing to undergo the
   punishment which he had deserved. When therefore, he confessed that he
   was guilty, and refused not to be punished, they became anxious to
   spare his life, though they were heathens, and also for the most part
   barbarians: and as each of them could not but be frightened with his
   immediate danger, the wonder is increased, that they had such regard
   for the life of one who alone was in fault, and who had now freely
   confessed this. But the Lord so turned their hearts, that they now saw
   more clearly how grievous a sin it was to flee away from the call of
   God, and not to yield obedience, as we have before observed, to his
   command. Many think that this is a light offense, and readily indulge
   themselves in it: but it is not in the power of men to weigh sins; the
   balance is deceitful when men estimate their sins according to their
   own judgment. Let us then learn to ascribe to God his own honor, --
   that he alone is Judge, and is far above us, and can alone determine
   how grievous or how slight any sin is. But common sense, except when
   men willfully deceive themselves by vain flatteries, clearly teaches
   this, -- that it is no light offense when we evade the command of God;
   for, as we have stated, men do thus take away from God his supreme
   authority; and what is left to God, when he governs not the creatures
   whom he has formed, and whom he sustains by his power? The Lord, then,
   designed to show here, that his displeasure could not be otherwise
   pacified than by drowning Jonah in the sea; though, as we shall
   presently see, he had something greater in view. But, in the meantime,
   this is worthy of being observed, -- that the Lord intended to make
   Jonah an example, that all may now know that he is not to be trifled
   with, but that he ought to be obeyed as soon as he commands any thing.

   The word which the Prophet uses has been variously explained by
   interpreters. chtr, chetar, is properly, to dig; so that some think it
   to be a metaphorical expression, as rowers seem to dig the sea; and
   this sense is not unsuitable. Others carry the metaphor still higher,
   -- that the sailors searched out or sought means by which they might
   drive the ship to land. But the other metaphor, as being less remote,
   is more to be approved. The Latins call it to toil, (moliri) when the
   rowers not only apply gently their oars, but when they make a greater
   effort. The sailors, then, toiled to bring back the ship [29] But for
   what purpose? To spare the life of the man who had already confessed
   that he was guilty before God, and that the storm, which threatened
   them all with a shipwreck, had arisen through his fault: but he says
   that they could not, for the sea was tempestuous, as we have already
   seen in our yesterday's lecture.

   I come now to the second verse. They cried, he says, to Jehovah and
   said, We beseech [30] , Jehovah, let us not perish, we pray, on account
   of the life of this man, and give not, that is, lay not, innocent blood
   upon us [31] The Prophet now expresses more fully why the sailors
   toiled so much to return to port, or to reach some shore, -- they were
   already persuaded that Jonah was a worshipper of the true God, and not
   only this, but that he was a Prophet, inasmuch as he had told them, as
   we have seen, that he had fled from the presence of God, because he
   feared to execute the command which we have noticed. It was therefore
   pious (reverentia) fear that restrained the sailors, knowing, as they
   did, that Jonah was the servant of the true God. They, at the same
   time, saw, that Jonah was already standing for his sin before God's
   tribunal, and that punishment was demanded. This they saw; but yet they
   wished to preserve his life.

   Now this place shows, that there is by nature implanted in all an
   abhorrence of cruelty; for however brutal and sanguinary many men may
   be, they yet cannot divest themselves of this feeling, -- that the
   effusion of human blood is hateful. Many, at the same time, harden
   themselves; but they apply a searing iron: they cannot shake off
   horror, nay, they feel that they are detested by God and by men, when
   they thus shed innocent blood. Hence it was that the sailors, who in
   other respects hardly retained a drop of humanity, fled as suppliants
   to God, when the case was about the death of man; and they said, 'nh
   yhvh, ane Ieve, We beseech Jehovah:' and the expression is repeated;
   which shows that the sailors earnestly prayed that the Lord would not
   impute this as a sin to them.

   We hence see that though these men had never known the doctrine of the
   law, they were yet so taught by nature that they knew that the blood of
   man is dear and precious in the sight of God. And as to us, we ought
   not only to imitate these sailors, but to go far beyond them: for not
   only ought the law of nature to prevail among us, but also the law of
   God; for we hear what God had formerly pronounced with his own mouth,

   Whosoever sheddeth man's blood, shed shall his blood be,' (Genesis
   9:6.)

   And we know also the reason why God undertakes to protect the life of
   men, and that is, because they have been created in his image.
   Whosoever then uses violence against the life of man, destroys, as far
   as he can the image of the eternal God. Since it is so, ought not
   violence and cruelty to be regarded by us with double horror? We ought
   also to learn another thing from this doctrine: God proves by this
   remarkable testimony what paternal feeling he manifests towards us by
   taking our life under his own guardianship and protection; and he even
   proves that we are really the objects of his care, inasmuch as he will
   execute punishment and vengeance when any one unjustly injures us. We
   then see that this doctrine on the one side restrains us, that we may
   not attempt anything against the lives of our brethren; and, on the
   other side, it assures us of the paternal love of God, so that being
   allured by his kindness we may learn to deliver up ourselves wholly to
   his protection.

   I now come to the last clause of the verse, For thou, Jehovah, hast
   done as it has pleased thee. The sailors clearly prove here that they
   did not willingly shed innocent blood. How then can these two things
   agree, -- that the blood was innocent, and that they were blameless?
   They adopted this excuse, -- that they obeyed God's decree, that they
   did nothing rashly or according to their own inclinations, but followed
   what the Lord had prescribed: though, indeed, God had not spoken, yet
   what he required was really evident; for as God demanded an expiation
   by the death of Jonah, so he designed to continue the tempest until he
   was thrown into the deep. These things the sailors now put forward. But
   we must notice, that they did not cast the blame on God, as blasphemers
   are wont to do, who, while they seek to exempt themselves from blame,
   find fault with God, or at least put him in their own place: "Why
   then," they say, "does he sit as a judge to condemn us for that of
   which he is himself the author, since he has so decreed?" At this day
   there are many fanatics who thus speak, who obliterate all the
   difference between good and evil, as if lust were to them the law. They
   at the same time make a covert of God's providence. Jonah wished not
   that such a thing should be thought of the sailors; but as they well
   understood that God governed the world justly, though his counsels be
   secret and cannot be comprehended by us, -- as, then, they were thus
   convinced, they thus strengthened themselves; and though they gave to
   God the praise due to his justice, they at the same time trembled lest
   they should be guilty of innocent blood.

   We now then see how reverently these men spoke of God, and that so much
   religious fear possessed them, that they did not rob God of his praise,
   Thou Jehovah, they said, hast done as it has pleased thee [32] Do they
   here accuse God of tyranny, as though he confounded all things without
   any cause or reason? By no means. They took this principle as granted,
   -- that the will of God is right and just, yea, that whatever God has
   decreed is beyond doubt just. Being then thus persuaded, they took the
   will of God as the rule for acting rightly: "As thou, Jehovah, hast
   done as it seemed good to thee, so we are blameless." But at the same
   time it is proper also to add, that the sailors do not vainly talk here
   of the secret providence of God in order to impute murder to him, as
   ungodly men and profane cavilers do at this day: but as the Lord made
   known his purpose to them, they show that the storm and the tempest
   could not be otherwise calmed and quieted than by drowning Jonah: they
   therefore took this knowledge of God's purpose as a certain rule to
   follow. At the same time they fled, as I have said, to God, and
   supplicated his mercy, lest in a matter so perplexed and difficult he
   should involve them in the same punishment, as they were constrained to
   shed innocent blood. We now then apprehend the meaning of this passage.
   Now it follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [29] Literally, "and the men labored to return to dry land." The ideal
   meaning of chtr is to dig, or to dig through, Job 24:16; Ezekiel 12:7:
   but it is here in its secondary sense of laboring or toiling. lhsyv, to
   return, must be taken here intransitively, though generally it bears in
   Hiphil a transitive sense. "Kai parebiazonto oi andres tou epistrepsai
   pros ten gen -- And the men strove to return to land." -- Sept. And the
   men rowed hard to regain the land." -- Henderson. -- Ed.

   [30] 'nh and n' are particles of entreaty or exclamation, and may be
   rendered, "I, or, we pray," according to the context. Here they should
   be, "We pray." They are sometimes rendered, Oh! Alas! Now. -- Ed.

   [31] "Hoc est, ne nobis imputes caedem viri justi -- Impute not unto us
   the slaughter of a just man." -- Marckius. See Judges 9:24; Matthew
   27:24. -- Ed.

   [32] Some render this sentence in the present tense, as Marckius, "Tu
   enim Jehovah sicut vis facis -- for thou, Jehovah, doest as thou
   willest." The verbs are in the past tense, but this tense in Hebrew
   includes often both times, -- "Thou hast done and doest, as thou hast
   willed and willest:" and this seems to be the full import of the
   passage. Mercerius, quoted by Poole, gives this paraphrase, -- "All
   these things have taken place through thine appointment, -- that Jonah
   came to the ship, that a storm has been raised, that the lot has fallen
   on Jonah, and that he has confessed his sin: we unwillingly do this
   dreadful deed, but this is understood to be thy will." Drusius took the
   words as referring to the time then present, for he expresses the
   meaning thus: "Tu vis ut in mare dejeciatur: fiat igitur quod vis; nam
   voluntati tuae quis resistat? Thou willest that he should be cast into
   the sea: be then that done which thou willest; for who can resist thy
   will?" According to this view, it is an expression of acquiescence in
   God's will respecting Jonah. But both Newcome and Henderson retain our
   common version. Dathius reads, "Tu enim, O Jova, pro arbitratu tuo
   agis. -- For thou, O Jehovah, doest according to thine own will." --
   Ed.

   Jonah 1:15

   15. So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea
   ceased from her raging.

   15. Et sustulerunt Jonam, et projecerunt in mare; et stetit mare a
   fervore suo.


   Jonah shows here that the tempest arose through his fault; for the
   issue proved this with certainty. The sailors had not only cast lots,
   but after Jonah was thrown into the sea the storm calmed, and the sea
   became still, -- this sudden change sufficiently proved that Jonah was
   the only cause why they were so nearly shipwrecked. For if the sea had
   not calmed immediately, but after some interval of time, it might have
   been ascribed to chance: but as the sea instantly rested, it could not
   be otherwise said than that Jonah was condemned by the judgment of God.
   He was indeed cast into the sea by the hands of men; but God so
   presided, that nothing could be ascribed to men, but that they executed
   the judgment which the Lord had openly demanded and required from them.
   This, then, is the import of this verse. He now adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jonah 1:16

   16. Then the men feared the Lord exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice
   unto the Lord, and made vows.

   16. Et imuerunt viri timore magno Jehovam, et sacrificarunt sacrificium
   Jehovae, et voverunt vota.


   Jonah now declares what fruit followed; and first, he says, that the
   sailors feared the true God. He uses here the proper name of God,
   Jehovah; for, as we have already seen, they were addicted to their own
   superstitions, as each of them cried to his own god: but it was a false
   notion; for they went astray after their own superstitions. The Prophet
   now points out the difference, -- that they began to fear the true God.
   At the same time it may have been, that they afterwards relapsed into
   their own errors; yet it ought not to be overlooked that the Lord
   constrained them to entertain such a fear. The Hebrews, as it has been
   already said, sometimes take fear in a general sense, as meaning
   worship. It is said in 2 Kings 17:32,33, of the new inhabitants of the
   land of Canaan, who had been removed from Persia, that they "feared
   God," that is, that they imitated the legal rite in sacrifices while
   worshipping God. But there is an addition in this place, which shows
   that the meaning is more restricted, for it is said to have been a
   great fear. Then Jonah means that the sailors and the passengers were
   not only touched with the fear of God, but that they also had the
   impression that the God of Israel was the supreme King of heaven and
   earth, that he held all things under his hand and government. This fear
   no doubt led them to true knowledge so as to know that they were
   previously deluded, and that whatever the world had invented was mere
   delusion, and that the gods devised by the fancies of men were nothing
   else but mere idols. We now then perceive what Jonah means.

   But we must here say somewhat more at large of the fear of God. When
   the Scripture speaks of the fear of God, it sometimes means the outward
   worship, and sometimes true piety. When it designates the outward
   worship, it is no great thing; for hypocrites usually perform their
   ceremonies, and thus testify that they worship God: but yet, as they
   obey not God with sincerity of heart, nor bring faith and repentance,
   they do nothing but trifle. But the fear of God is often taken for true
   piety; and then it is called the beginning or the chief point of
   wisdom, or even wisdom itself, as it is in Job 28:28. The fear of God,
   then, or that pious regard (reventia) by which the faithful willingly
   submit themselves to God, is the chief part of wisdom.

   But it also often happens that men are touched by servile fear, so as
   to have a desire to satisfy God, while, at the same time, they have
   even a wish to draw him down from his throne. This servile fear is full
   of perverseness; for they, at the same time, champ the bridle, as they
   cannot exempt themselves from his power and authority. Such was this
   fear of which Jonah speaks; for all those whom he mentions were not
   suddenly so changed as to devote themselves to the true God: they had
   not indeed made such a progress as this; it was not such real and
   thorough conversion of the soul as changed them into new men. How,
   then, is it said that they feared? even because the Lord extorted from
   them a confession at the time: it may have been that some of them
   afterwards made a greater progress; but I speak now generally of the
   whole. Because then it is said that they feared God, we are not hence
   to conclude that they really repented, so as to become wholly devoted
   to the God of Israel. But yet they were constrained to know and to
   confess that the God of Israel was the only and the true God. How so?
   because that dreadful judgment filled them with terror, so that they
   perceived that he alone was God who had heaven and earth under his
   command.

   We now then see how that fear is to be viewed, of which Jonah speaks.
   If they afterwards made no farther progress, it only served to condemn
   them, that these sailors, having perceived by a sure evidence who the
   only true God was, mingled with the worship of him their wicked and
   ungodly superstitions, as many do even in our day. The Papists hold
   this truth in common with us, -- that there is one true God, the framer
   of heaven and earth, yea, they come still nearer, and say that the
   only-begotten Son of God is our Redeemer; but yet we see how they
   contaminate the whole worship of God, and turn his truth to a lie; for
   they blend the worship of God with that of idols, so that there is
   nothing pure among them. But this main truth is however of great
   service, when the Lord stretches forth his hand to miserable men; for
   if there was no conviction of this under the Papacy that the word of
   God is to be believed, and that Christ the Son of God is the King and
   Head of the Church, we must have had to employ against them a long
   circuitous argument; but now an access to them is easy: when we bring
   against them the Law, and the Prophets, and the Gospel, they are
   restrained by some measure of reverence, and dare not to reject the
   authority of the Supreme God. We then see, that this fear is in itself
   of no great value, if men remain fixed in their own mire; but when it
   is the Lords purpose afterwards to call them, this fear opens for them
   the door to true godliness. So it may have been, as I have said, that
   some of these sailors and passengers had afterwards made better
   progress. But this fear of itself could have done nothing more than to
   convict them, so that no excuse could avail them before God's tribunal;
   for a proof had been given them, by which they might know that there
   was no other God than He who was then worshipped by the chosen people.

   He afterwards adds that they sacrificed a sacrifice to Jehovah [33]
   They were accustomed before to offer sacrifices to their idols; but now
   they testified that they worshipped the God of Israel; for this is what
   sacrifices signify. But it must at the same time be observed that they
   thereby expressed this confession, that God confirmed the truth of his
   word. When, therefore, they perceived that this whole affair was
   ordered by the will of God, they were constrained to bear witness that
   he was the true God: this was the end and design of sacrifices.

   It may, however, be inquired, whether that sacrifice pleased God. It is
   certain that whenever men bring forward their own devices, whatever is
   otherwise worthy of approbation in what they do, it cannot but be
   corrupted and vitiated by such a mixture; for God, as it is well known,
   allows of no associate. And we must remember that which is said in
   Ezekiel, Go ye, sacrifice to the devil, and not to me!' God there
   repudiates all the sacrifices which were wont to be offered by the
   people of Israel, because superstitions were blended with them. God
   then shows that such a mixture is so disapproved by him, that he
   chooses rather that the superstitious should wholly give themselves up
   to the devils than that his holy name should be thus profaned. Hence
   this sacrifice of itself was not lawful, nor could it have pleased God;
   but it was, so to speak, by accident and extrinsically that this
   sacrifice pleased God, -- because he designed thus to make known his
   glory. Though, then, he repudiated the sailors themselves, yet it was
   his will that this act should bear a testimony to his glory: as, for
   instance, a deed is often vicious with regard to men, and yet in an
   accidental way it tends to set forth the glory of God.

   And this ought to be carefully borne in mind: there is at this day a
   dispute, yea a fierce contest, about good works: and the Sophists ever
   deceive themselves by false reasoning; (paralogismo -- sophistry) for
   they suppose that works morally good are either preparatory to the
   obtaining of grace, or meritorious towards attaining eternal life. When
   they speak of works morally good, they refer only to the outward deeds;
   they regard not the fountain or motive, nor even the end. When the
   heart of man is impure, unquestionably the work which thence flows is
   also ever impure, and is an abomination before God. When the end also
   is wrong, when it is not man's purpose to worship God in sincerity of
   heart, the deed, however splendid it may appear, is filth in the
   presence of God. Hence the Sophists are greatly deceived, and are very
   childish, when they say, that works morally good please God, and are
   preparatory to grace and meritorious of salvation. But can this be,
   that a work does not please God, and yet avails to set forth his glory?
   I answer, that these two things are perfectly consistent, and are in no
   way so contrary that they cannot be easily reconciled. For God by
   accident, as I have said, accommodates to his own glory what is in
   itself vicious; I say, in itself, that is, with respect to men. Thus
   even under the Papacy the Christian name serves to the glory of God,
   for there ever remains some remnant. And how has it happened, that at
   this time the light of the Gospel has shone forth, and that true
   religion has been restored at least in many places? Even because the
   Lord has never suffered true religion to be extinguished, though it has
   been corrupted: for baptism under the Papacy, the very name of Christ
   as well as of the Church, and the very form of religion -- all these
   have become wholly useless; but they have accidentally, as I have said,
   been of great service. When, therefore, we regard the priests
   (sacrificos -- the sacrificers) as well as the people, we find nothing
   but a perverted worship of God; they presumptuously and
   indiscriminately add their own superstitions and devices to the word of
   God, and there is nothing pure among them. Since then they thus blend
   together heaven and earth, they do nothing but provoke God's wrath
   against themselves.

   We now then understand why Jonah says that the sailors and passengers
   offered sacrifices. We must, at the same time, remember what I have
   lately said, that sacrifice was, as it were, a symbol of Divine
   worship: for even from the beginning this notion prevailed among all,
   that sacrifices were to be offered to none but to God; and heathens in
   all ages had no other opinion of sacrifices, but that they thus
   manifested their piety towards their gods. Since then sacrifices have
   been from the beginning offered to God alone, it follows, that they at
   this day are wholly inexcusable who join associates to God, and offer
   their sacrifices to mortals or to angels. How can this be borne in
   Christians, since heathens have ever confessed that they regarded those
   as gods to whom they were wont to offer their sacrifices? Now then,
   since God declares that the chief sacrifice to him is invocations as we
   read in Psalm 1:1, the whole of religion under the Papacy must be
   perverted, as they pray not only to God but even to creatures: for they
   hesitate not to flee to Peter or to Paul, yea, to their own saints,
   real and fictitious, in the same manner as to the only true God.
   Inasmuch, then, as they rob God of this chief right, we see that they
   tread under foot the whole of religion by this sacrilege. Since, then,
   heathen men testified that they worshipped Jehovah, the God of Israel,
   by their external sacrifice, let us learn at this day not to transfer
   the rightful honor of God to creatures; but let this honor of being
   alone prayed to, be wholly and entirely reserved for him; for this, as
   we have said is the chief and the most valuable sacrifice which he
   demands and approves.

   But Jonah also adds, that the sailors vowed vows to God This is a part
   of thanksgiving; for we know that the object, not only of the holy
   fathers, but also of the superstitious, in making vows, has ever been
   this -- to bind themselves to God, and also to express their gratitude,
   and to make it evident, that they owed to him both their life and every
   favor bestowed on them. This then has in all ages been the reason for
   making, vows. When, therefore the sailors vowed a vow to God, they
   renounced their own idols. They cried before to their gods; but now
   they understand that they had cried in vain, and without any benefit,
   as they had to no purpose uttered their cries in the air. Now then they
   made their vows to the only true God; for they knew that their lives
   were in his hand.

   And here we may easily learn how foolishly the Sophists of our day heap
   together all passages of Scripture which make any mention of vows; for
   they think that we are to be overwhelmed by that term alone, when we
   condemn their false vows. But no one of us has ever denied or does
   deny, that it is lawful to vows provided it be done according to what
   the Law and the Gospel prescribes. What we hold is, -- that men are not
   thoughtlessly to obtrude on God what comes uppermost, but that they are
   to vow what he approves, and also, that they regard a right and just
   end in vowing, even to testify their gratitude to God. But in common
   vows which are made, there are the grossest errors, as also in the
   whole of the Papal worship; for they vow this and that to God
   indiscriminately, and regard not what the Lord requires or approves:
   one, on certain days, abstains from meat; another combs not his head:
   and a third trots away on some pilgrimage. All these things, we know,
   are rejected by God. And further, when they vow nothing but what God
   approves, it is yet done for a wrong purpose: for they seek in this way
   to bind God to themselves, and the diabolical conceit of merits ever
   possesses their minds. And, lastly, they consider not what they can do;
   they vow perpetual celibacy when at the same time incontinence burns
   them; and thus we see that, like the giants, they fight with God
   himself; and, in the meantime, they allow themselves an unbridled
   liberty as to whatever they vow.

   Let us then know, that whenever the Scripture speaks of vows, we are to
   take for granted these two principles, -- that vows as they appertain
   to the worship of God, ought not to be taken without any discretion,
   according to men's fancy, but ought to be regulated and guided by God's
   rule, so that men may bring nothing to God, except what they know to be
   approved by his word, -- and then, that they are to keep in view the
   right end, even to show by this symbol their gratitude to God, to
   testify that they are preserved by his kindness, as was the case with
   these sailors, who made a vow because they thought that none but God
   was their deliverer; and so they testified, that when they came safe to
   shore, they would make it known that the God of Israel had showed mercy
   to them. It follows --

   board a vessel, since the ark floated on the waters of the great
   deluge."
   How uselessly have learned men often employed their talents, trying to
   improve what is simply and plainly related. Jerome allegorizes this act
   of the mariners, and says that their sacrifice was that of praise. A
   Jewish Rabbi, Jonathan, makes an addition to the sentence -- that they
   said that they would sacrifice to Jehovah; and Grotius adopts his
   addition. Another Rabbi, Elieser, has fabricated a fine tale, that they
   returned immediately to Joppa, went up to Jerusalem, and were
   circumcised! The fact alone is stated here, as to when and where we
   know nothing, and it signifies nothing to us; only that the most
   obvious import of the narrative is, that they did offer a sacrifice on
   board the vessel, immediately after the storm ceased. -- Ed.

   Jonah 1:17

   17. Now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And
   Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.

   17. Et paravit Jehova piscem magnum ad vorandum Jonam; et fuit Jonas in
   visceribus piscis tribus diebus et tribus noctibus.


   What the Prophet here briefly relates ought to be carefully weighed by
   us. It is easily passed over, when we read in a few words that Jonah
   was swallowed up by a fish, and that he was there three days and three
   nights: but though Jonah neither amplified or illustrated in a
   rhetorical manner what is overlooked by us, nor adopted any display of
   words, but spoke of the event as though it were an ordinary thing, we
   yet see what the event itself really was: Jonah was cast into the sea.
   He had been previously not only a worshipper of the true God, but also
   a Prophet, and had no doubt faithfully discharged his office; for God
   would not have resolved to send him to Nineveh, had he not conferred on
   him suitable gifts; and he knew him to be qualified for undertaking a
   burden so great and so important. As Jonah then had faithfully
   endeavored to serve God, and to devote himself to him through the whole
   of his past life, now that he is cast into the sea as one unworthy of
   the common light, that he is cut off from the society of men, and that
   he seems unworthy of undergoing a common or an ordinary punishment, but
   is exiled, as it were, from the world, so as to be deprived of light
   and air, as parricides, to whom formerly, as it is well-known, this
   punishment was allotted -- as then Jonah saw that he was thus dealt
   with, what must have been the state of his mind?

   Now that he tells us that he was three whole days in the inside of the
   fish, it is certain that the Lord had so awakened him that he must have
   endured continual uneasiness. He was asleep before he was swallowed by
   the fish; but the Lord drew him, as it were, by force to his tribunal,
   and he must have suffered a continual execution. He must have every
   moment entertained such thoughts as these, "Why does he now thus deal
   with thee? God does not indeed slay thee at once, but intends to expose
   thee to innumerable deaths." We see what Job says, that when he died he
   would be at rest and free from all evils, (Job 14:6.) Jonah no doubt
   continually boiled with grief, because he knew that God was opposed to
   and displeased with him: he doubtless said to himself, "Thou hast to
   do, not with men, but with God himself, who now pursues thee, because
   thou hast become a fugitive from his presence." As Jonah then must have
   necessarily thus thought within himself of God's wrath, his case must
   have been harder than hundred deaths, as it had been with Job and with
   many others, who made it their chief petition that they might die. Now
   as he was not slain but languished in continual torments, it is certain
   that no one of us can comprehend, much less convey in words what must
   have come into the mind of Jonah during these three days. But I cannot
   now discuss what remains; I must therefore defer it to the next
   lecture.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou settest before us this day thy holy
   Prophet as an awful example of thy wrath against all who are rebellious
   and disobedient to thee, -- O grant, that we may learn so to subject
   all our thoughts and affections to thy word, that we may not reject any
   thing that pleases thee, but so learn both to live and to die to thee,
   that we may ever regard thy will, and undertake nothing but what thou
   hast testified is approved by thee, so that we may fight under thy
   banners, and through life obey thy word, until at length we reach that
   blessed rest which has been obtained for us by the blood of thy only
   begotten Son, and is laid up for us in heaven through the hope of his
   Gospel. Amen.

   lecture Seventy-sixth

   In yesterday's lecture we began to explain the last verse of the first
   chapter, in which Jonah said, that a fish was prepared by the Lord We
   stated that it could not have been otherwise but that Jonah, when he
   was in the inside of the fish, must have felt the most grievous
   agonies, as though he had been doomed to perpetual death, as long as he
   was deprived of the enjoyment of God's favor: and this fact will be
   further explained when his song comes under our consideration.

   But now there is a question to be considered and that is whether God
   created a fish to receive Jonah. The expression, that God prepared a
   fish [34] seems indeed to mean this; for if the fish had already been
   swimming in the sea, the Prophet might have adopted another mode of
   speaking and said, that the Lord caused the fish to meet him or that
   God had sent a fish; for so the Scripture usually speaks: but a fish is
   said to have been prepared. This doubt may be thus removed, -- that
   though God may not have created the fish, he had yet prepared him for
   this purpose; for we know that it was not according to the course of
   nature that the fish swallowed Jonah, and also, that he was preserved
   uninjured in his inside for three days and three nights. I therefore
   refer what is said here, that a fish was prepared, to the preservation
   of Jonah: for it is certain that there are some fishes which can
   swallow men whole and entire. And William Rondelet, who has written a
   book on the fishes of the sea, concludes that in all probability it
   must have been the Lamia. He himself saw that fish, and he says that it
   has a belly so capacious and, mouth so wide, that it can easily swallow
   up a man; and he says that a man in armor has sometimes been found in
   the inside of the Lamia. Therefore, as I have said, either a whale, or
   a Lamia, or a fish unknown to us, may be able to swallow up a man whole
   and entire; but he who is thus devoured cannot live in the inside of a
   fish. Hence Jonah, that he might mark it out as a miracle, says that
   the fish was prepared by the Lord; for he was received into the inside
   of the fish as though it were into an hospital; and though he had no
   rest there, yet he was as safe as to his body, as though he were
   walking on land. Since then the Lord, contrary to the order of nature,
   preserved there his Prophet, it is no wonder that he says that the fish
   was prepared by the Lord. I come now to the second chapter.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [34] The verb mnh does not necessarily include the idea of creation,
   but its meaning is, to distribute, to arrange, to order, to provide, to
   prepare; and yet this preparation may involve the exercise of a
   creative power, as in the case of the gourd mentioned in the fourth
   chapter, for it is the same verb. Though it might be an indigenous
   plant, yet to provide it so quickly in one night was the act of Divine
   power. So also as to this fish, it might or it might not have been one
   usually found in that part of the sea. To provide it, but bringing it
   to the spot, was as much a miracle as to provide it by a new act of
   creation. To allow the one and to deny the other, is wholly
   unreasonable. The whole was clearly miraculous: and the discovery of
   any such fish now does not in the least render the transaction less
   miraculous. Every part of it must be ascribed to a Divine
   interposition; and let those stumble who are resolved to stumble. It
   has been supposed to have been the "whale," because the word ketos is
   used in the reference made to Jonah in Matthew 12:40: but that word is
   a general term applied to a large fish, and does not necessarily mean
   the whale. ketos, says Ribera, in his comment on Jonah, non certae
   speciei, sed generis nomen est, et piscem quemvis magnum significat. --
   Ed.

   Chapter 2.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jonah 2:1-2

   1. Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fish's belly,

   1. Et oravit Jonas ad Jehovam Deum suum e ventre piscis;

   2. And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord, and he
   heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice.

   2. Et dixit clamavi in angustia mea ad Jehovam, et exaudit me (vel,
   respondit mihi;) e ventre sepulchri vociferatus sum, audivisti vocem
   meam. [35]


   When Jonah says that he prayed from the bowels of the fish, he shows
   first with what courage of mind he was endued. He had then put on a new
   heart; for when he was at liberty he thought that he could in a manner
   escape from God, he became a fugitive from the Lord: but now while
   inclosed within narrow bounds, he begins to pray, and of his own accord
   sets himself in God's presence.

   This is a change worthy of being noticed: and hence we may learn how
   much it profits us to be drawn back often as it were by cords, or to be
   held tied up with fetters because when we are free we go astray here
   and there beyond all limits. Jonah, when he was at liberty, became, as
   we have seen, wanton; but now finding himself restrained by the mighty
   hand of God, he receives a new mind, and prays from the bowels of the
   fish [36] . But how was it that he directed his petitions then to God,
   by whose hand he saw that he was so heavily pressed? For God most
   rigidly handled him; Jonah was in a manner doomed to eternal ruin; the
   bowels of the fish, as we shall hereafter see, were indeed to him as it
   were hell or the grave. But in this state of despair Jonah even
   gathered courage, and was able to retake himself directly to God. It
   was a wonderful and almost incredible example of faith. Let us then
   learn to weigh well what is here said; for when the Lord heavily
   afflicts us, it is then a legitimate and seasonable time for prayer.
   But we know that the greater part despond, and do not usually offer
   their prayers freely to God, except their minds be in a calm state; and
   yet God then especially invites us to himself when we are reduced to
   extremities. Let this, then, which Jonah declares of himself, come to
   our minds, -- that he cried to God from hell itself: and, at the same
   time, he assures us that his prayer proceeded from true faith; for he
   does not simply say that he prayed to Jehovah, but he adds that he was
   his God; and he speaks with a serious and deeply-reflective mind.
   Though Jonah then was not only like one dead, but also on the confines
   of perdition, he yet believed that God would be merciful if he fled to
   him. We hence see that Jonah prayed not at random, as hypocrites are
   wont to take God's name in their mouths when they are in distress, but
   he prayed in earnest; for he was persuaded that God would be propitious
   to him.

   But we must remember that his prayer was not composed in the words
   which are here related; but Jonah, while in the bowels of the fish,
   dwelt on these thoughts in his mind. Hence he relates in this song how
   he thought and felt; and we shall see that he was then in a state of
   distraction, as our minds must necessarily be tossed here and there by
   temptations. For the servants of God do not gain the victory without
   great struggle. We must fight, and indeed strenuously, that we may
   conquer. Jonah then in this song shows that he was agitated with great
   trouble and hard contests: yet this conviction was firmly fixed in his
   heart, -- that God was to be sought, and would not be sought in vain,
   as he is ever ready to bring help to his people whenever they cry to
   him.

   Then he says, I cried, when I had trouble, to Jehovah, and he answered
   me. Jonah no doubt relates now, after having come forth from the bowels
   of the fish, what had happened to him, and he gives thanks to the Lord.
   [37] This verse then contains two parts, -- that Jonah in his trouble
   fled to God, -- and the latter part contains thanksgiving for having
   been miraculously delivered beyond what flesh could have thought. I
   cried, he says, in my distress, to Jehovah; I cried out from the bowels
   of hell, thou hast heard my voice. Jonah, as we shall hereafter see,
   directed his prayers to God not without great struggle; he contended
   with many difficulties; but however great the impediments in his way,
   he still persevered and ceased not from praying. He now tells us that
   he had not prayed in vain; and, that he might amplify the grace of God,
   he says, from the bowels of the grave He mentioned distress (angustiam
   -- straitness) in the first clause; but here he more clearly expresses
   how remarkable and extraordinary had been the kindness of God, that he
   came forth safe from the bowels of the fish, which were like the bowels
   of the grave. s'vl, shaul, derived from corruption, is called the grave
   by the Hebrews, and the Latin translator has almost everywhere rendered
   it hell, (infernum;) and s'vl, shaul, is also sometimes taken for hell,
   that is, the state of the reprobate, because they know that they are
   condemned by God: it is, however, taken more frequently for the grave;
   and I am disposed to retain this sense, -- that the fish was like the
   grave. But he means that he was so shut up in the grave, that there was
   no escape open to him.

   What are the bowels of the grave? Even the inside or the recess of the
   grave itself. When Jonah was in this state, he says, that he was heard
   by the Lord. It may be proper to repeat again what I have already
   slightly touched, -- that Jonah was not so oppressed, though under the
   heaviest trial, but that his petitions came forth to God. He prayed as
   it were from hell, and not simply prayed, for he, at the same time,
   sets forth his vehemence and ardor by saying, that he cried and cried
   aloud. Distress, no doubt, extorted from Jonah these urgent entreaties.
   However this might have been, he did not howl, as the unbelieving are
   wont to do, who feel their own evils and bitterly complain; and yet
   they pour forth vain howlings. Jonah here shows himself to be different
   from them by saying, that he cried and cried aloud to God. It now
   follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [35] It is remarkable that several sentences in this prayer, as it has
   been observed by Marchius and Henderson, are exactly the same, not only
   in sense, but also, in most instances, in words, with passages in the
   Psalms. The first clause of this verse is found in Psalm 120:1, only
   the words are differently arranged. The last clause of the third verse,
   both in words and order, is the same with a distich in Psalm 42:7. The
   beginning of the fourth verse agrees nearly with Psalm 31:22; and so
   does the fifth verse with a line in Psalm 69:1, one word being
   different. The first clause of the seventh verse is found in the very
   same words in Psalm 142:3; and the first line in the eighth verse is
   Psalm 31:6, with the exception of one letter; and the last words of the
   ninth verse are to be met within Psalm 3:8, only the order is reversed.
   "On the supposition," says Henderson, "that Jonah was familiar with the
   Psalms, it was very natural for him to incorporate sentences taken from
   them with his own language." -- Ed.

   [36] "No place amiss for prayer, I will that men pray everywhere; where
   ever God casts us we may find a way open heavenwards, if it be now our
   own fault. Jonah was now in the bottom of the sea, yet out of the
   depths he cries to God." -- M. Henry. "It may be asked, How could Jonah
   either pray or breathe in the stomach of a fish? Very easily, if God so
   willed it. And let the reader keep this constantly in view: the whole
   is a miracle, from Jonah's being swallowed by the fish, till he was
   cast ashore by the same animal. It was God that had prepared the great
   fish; it was the Lord that spake to the fish, and caused it to vomit
   Jonah on the dry land. All is miracle." -- Adam Clarke. -- Ed.

   [37] He relates here, as it appears from the preceding, "and he said,"
   the prayer he offered when in the fish's bowels, and not a prayer
   offered after his deliverance. Some have entertained the latter
   opinion, because some of the verbs here are in the past tense: but this
   circumstance only shows that he continued to pray from the time when he
   was swallowed by the fish to the time when he was delivered. It was a
   continued act. It is the same as though he said, "I have called, and do
   call on Jehovah." Marckius, and also Dathius, render the verbs in the
   present tense, "I call," etc. The following is a translation according
   to the view of this prayer, -- 3. I call in my distress on Jehovah, and
   he will answer me;
   From the belly of the grave I cry, -- thou hearest my voice. 4. When
   thou didst send me to the deep, into the midst of the waters,
   And the flood surrounded me, --
   Thy billows and waves over me passed; 5. Then I said, I am banished
   from the sight of thine eyes; --
   Yet I will again look towards the temple of thy holiness. 6. Encompass
   me do the waters to the soul,
   The deep surrounds me,
   The sedge is wrapped around my head: 7. To the cuttings off of the
   mountains have I descended;
   The earth! Its bars are continually around me:
   But thou wilt bring from destruction my life,
   O Jehovah, my God. 8. When overwhelmed within me was my soul,
   Jehovah did I remember;
   And come to thee shall my prayer --
   To the temple of thy holiness. 9. They who regard idols of vanity,
   Their own mercy forsake: 10. But I, with the voice of praise, will
   sacrifice to thee,
   What I have vowed will I fulfill:
   Salvation belongs to Jehovah. "The cuttings off," in verse 7, says
   Parkhurst, were those parts which were cut off from the mountains at
   the deluge. The Septuagint has schismas -- rents-clefts. Roots,
   bottoms, foundations, have been adopted by some, but not consistently
   with the meaning of the original word, -- "The bars or bolts" of the
   earth convey the idea of impediments in his way to return to the earth.
   They were "around" him, or literally "upon" him, vdy, that is, they
   were, as it were, closed upon him. -- Ed.

   Jonah 2:3

   3. For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and
   the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed
   over me.

   3. Atqui projeceras me in profundum, in cor marium, et fluvius
   circumdedit me; omnes conflictus tui (sed hac voce intelligit undas
   quae inter se confligunt; scimus enim esse varias collisiones, ideo
   vertunt aliqui, contritiones tui, nam schr significat proprie
   confligere et frangere; perinde est igitur ac si diceret, omnes
   fracturae tuae et collisiones super me transierunt, et explicat quid
   velit, quum dicit) fluctus tui super me transierunt.


   In this verse are set forth his difficulties: for Jonah, for the sake
   of amplifying, refers to his condition. It was a great thing that he
   cried to God from the bowels of the fish; but it was far more difficult
   for him to raise up his mind in prayer, when he knew or thought God to
   be angry with him: for had he been thrown into extreme evils, he might
   yet call upon God; but as it came to his mind that all the evil he
   suffered was inflicted by God, because he tried to shun his call, how
   was it possible for him to penetrate into heaven when such an obstacle
   stood in his way? We hence see the design of these words, But thou
   hadst cast me into the gulf, into the heart of the sea; the flood
   surrounded me, all thy billows and waves passed over me.

   In short, Jonah shows here what dreadful temptations presented
   themselves to him while he was endeavoring to offer up prayers. It came
   first to his mind that God was his most inveterate enemy. For Jonah did
   not then think of the sailors and the rest who had cast him into the
   sea; but his mind was fixed on God: this is the reason why he says,
   Thou, Lord, hadst cast me into the deep, into the heart of the sea; and
   then, Thy billows, Thy waves [38] He does not here regard the nature of
   the sea; but he bestows, as I have already said, all his thoughts on
   God, and acknowledges that he had to do with him; as though he said,
   "Thou Lord, in pursuing me, drivest me away; but to thee do I come:
   thou showest by dreadful proofs that thou art offended with me, but yet
   I seek thee; so far is it that these terrors drive me to a distance
   from thee, that now, being subdued as it were by thy goads, I come
   willingly to thee; for nowhere else is there for me any hope of
   deliverance." We now then see how much avails the contrast, when Jonah
   sets the terrible punishment which he endured in opposition to his
   prayer. Let us now proceed --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [38] "He calls them God's billows and his waves, not because he made
   and rules them, but because he had now commissioned them against Jonah,
   and ordered them to afflict and terrify, but not to destroy him. These
   words are plainly quoted by Jonah from Psalm 42:7. What David spoke
   figuratively and metaphorically, Jonah applies to himself as literally
   fulfilled." -- M. Henry.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jonah 2:4

   4. Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again
   toward thy holy temple.

   4. Tunc ego dixi, (nam copula resolvi debet in adverbium temporis,)
   Expulsus sum a conspectu oculorum tuorum; verum adjiciam aspicere ad
   templum sanctitatis tuae.


   In the first clause of this verse Jonah confirms again what I have
   said, -- that when he sought to pray, not only the door was closed
   against him, but there were mountains, as it were, intervening, so that
   he could not breathe a prayer to God: for he did not so much think of
   the state in which he was; nay, but he chiefly considered his own case,
   how he had provoked the wrath of God. Hence he says, I have said, I am
   cast away from the sight of thine eyes. Some give this frigid
   exposition, that he had been only expelled from his own country, that
   he might not behold the temple. But I have no doubt but that Jonah
   tells us here that he suffered extreme agonies, as though every hope of
   pardon had been cut off from him: "What! shall I yet hope that God will
   be propitious? It is not to be hoped." This then is the casting away of
   which he speaks: for it is said that God casts us away, when he allows
   us no access to him. Hence Jonah thought that he was wholly alienated
   from God. Were any to object and say, that then his faith must have
   been extinct; the obvious answer is, -- that in the struggle of faith
   there are internal conflicts; one thought is suggested, and then
   another of an opposite character meets it; there would indeed be no
   trial of our faith, except there were such internal conflicts; for
   when, with appeased minds, we can feel assured that God is propitious
   to us, what is the trial of faith? But when the flesh tells us that God
   is opposed to us, and that there is no more hope of pardon, faith at
   length sets up its shield, and repels this onset of temptation, and
   entertains hope of pardon: whenever God for a time appears implacable,
   then faith indeed is tried. Such then was the condition of Jonah; for,
   according to the judgment of the flesh, he thought that he was utterly
   cast away by God, so that he came to him in vain. Jonah, then, having
   not yet put off flesh and blood, could not immediately lay hold on the
   grace of God, but difficulties met him in his course.

   The latter clause is differently explained by interpreters. Some take
   it negatively, "I shall no more look towards the temple of thy
   holiness:" but the words admit not of this explanation. 'k, ak, means
   in Hebrew, truly, nevertheless; and it means also, certainly; and
   sometimes it is taken dubitatively, perhaps. The greater part of
   expounders render the clause thus, "But I shall see the temple of thy
   holiness;" as though Jonah here reproved his own distrust, which he had
   just expressed, as the case is with the faithful, who immediately check
   themselves, when they are tempted to entertain any doubt: "What! dost
   thou then cast away hope, when yet God will be reconciled to thee if
   thou wilt come to him?" Hence interpreters think that it is a sort of
   correction, as though Jonah here changed his mind, and retracted what
   he had previously taken up, as a false principle derived from the
   judgment of the flesh. He had said then that he had been cast away from
   the presence of the Lord; but now, according to these expositors, he
   repels that temptation, But I shall see thy holy temple; though I seem
   now to be rejected by thee, thou wilt at last receive me into favor. We
   may, however, explain this clause, consistently with the former, in
   this way, At least, or, but, I would again see, etc., as an expression
   of a wish. The future then may be taken for the optative mood, as we
   know that the Hebrews are wont thus to use the future tense, either
   when they pray or express a wish. This meaning then best agrees with
   the passage, that Jonah as yet doubtingly prays, At least, or, but, I
   would again, O Lord, see the temple of thy holiness. But since the
   former explanation which I have mentioned is probable, I do not contend
   for this. However this may be, we find that Jonah did not wholly
   despair, though the judgment of the flesh would drive him to despair;
   for he immediately turned his address to God. For they who murmur
   against God, on the contrary, speak in the third person, turning
   themselves, as it were, away from him: but Jonah here sets God before
   his eyes, I have been cast away, he says, from the sight of thine eyes
   He does not remonstrate here with God, but shows that he was seeking
   God still, though he thought that he was cast far away.

   Then he adds, I would at least see again the temple of thy holiness.
   And by speaking of the temple, he no doubt set the temple before him as
   an encouragement to his faith. As then he had been cast away, he
   gathers everything that might avail to raise up and confirm his hope.
   He had indeed been circumcised, he had been a worshipper of God from
   his childhood, he had been educated in the Law, he had exercised
   himself in offering sacrifices: under the name of temple he now
   includes briefly all these things. We hence see that he thus encouraged
   himself to entertain good hope in his extreme necessity. And this is a
   useful admonition; for when every access to God seems closed up against
   us, nothing is more useful than to recall to mind, that he has adopted
   us from our very infancy, that he has also testified his favor by many
   tokens, especially that he has called us by his Gospel into a
   fellowship with his only-begotten Son, who is life and salvation; and
   then, that he has confirmed his favor both by Baptism and the Supper.
   When, therefore, these things come to our minds, we may be able by
   faith to break through all impediments. Let us go on --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jonah 2:5-6

   5. The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth closed me
   round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.

   5. Obsederunt me aquae usque ad animam, abyssus undique circumdedit me,
   juncus alligatus fuit capite meo:

   6. I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars
   was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from
   corruption, O Lord my God.

   6. Ad radices (proprie, excisuras; nam qtsv significat excidere; alii
   vertunt, ad fines extremos; ad radices igitur) montium descendi; terra
   cum vectibus suis circum me in seculum: et ascendere fecisti vitam meam
   e sepulchro (est aliud nomen quam s'vl, nempe, sht; alii vertunt, a
   corruptione, vel, interitu,) Jehova, Deus mi.


   Here in many words Jonah relates how many things had happened to him,
   which were calculated to overwhelm his mind with terror and to drive
   him far from God, and to take away every desire for prayer. But we must
   ever bear in mind what we have already stated, -- that he had to do
   with God: and this ought to be well considered by us. The case was the
   same with David, when he says in Psalm 39:9, Thou hast yet done it;'
   for, after having complained of his enemies, he turned his mind to God:
   "What then do I? what do I gain by these complaints? for men alone do
   not vex me; thou, God, he says, hast done this." So it was with Jonah;
   he ever set before him the wrath of God, for he knew that such a
   calamity had not happened to him but on account of his sins.

   He therefore says that he was by waters beset, and then, that he was
   surrounded by the deep; but at length he adds, that God made his life
   to ascend, etc. All these circumstances tend to show that Jonah could
   not have raised up his mind to God except through an extraordinary
   miracle, as his life was in so many ways oppressed. When he says that
   he was beset with waters even to the soul, I understand it to have been
   to the peril of his life; for other explanations seem frigid and
   strained. And the Hebrews says that to be pressed to the soul, is to be
   in danger of one's life; as the Latins, meaning the same thing, say
   that the heart, or the inside, or the bowels, are wounded. So also in
   this place the same thing is meant, The waters beset me even to the
   soul,' and then, the abyss surrounds me.' Some render svph, suph,
   sedge; others sea-weed; others bulrush: but the sense amounts to the
   same thing. No doubt svph, suph, is a species of sedge; and some think
   that the Red Sea was thus called, because it is full of sedges or
   bulrushes. They think also that bulrushes are thus called, because they
   soon putrefy. But what Jonah means is certain and that is, that weed
   enveloped his head, or that weed grew around his head: but to refer
   this to the head of the fish, as some do, is improper: Jonah speaks
   metaphorically when he says that he was entangled in the sedge,
   inasmuch as there is no hope when any one is rolled in the sedge at the
   bottom of the sea. How, indeed, can he escape from drowning who is thus
   held, as it were, tied up? It is then to be understood metaphorically;
   for Jonah meant that he was so sunk that he could not swim, except
   through the ineffable power of God.

   According to the same sense he says, I descended to the roots of the
   mountains. But he speaks of promontories, which were nigh the sea; as
   though he had said, that he was not cast into the midst of the sea, but
   that he had so sunk as to be fixed in the deep under the roots of
   mountains. All these things have the same designs which was to show
   that no deliverance could be hoped for, except God stretched forth his
   hand from heaven, and indeed in a manner new and incredible.

   He says that the earth with its bars was around him. He means by this
   kind of speaking, that he was so shut up, as if the whole earth had
   been like a door. We know what sort of bars are those of the earth,
   when we ascribe bars to it: for when any door is fastened with bolts,
   we know how small a portion it is. But when we suppose the earth itself
   to be like a door, what kind of things must the bolts be? It is the
   same thing then as though Jonah had said, that he was so hindered from
   the vital light, as if the earth had been set against him to prevent
   his coming forth to behold the sun: the earth, then, was set against
   me, and that for ever

   He afterwards comes to thanksgiving, And thou Jehovah, my God, hast
   made my life to ascend from the grave. Jonah, after having given a long
   description, for the purpose of showing that he was not once put to
   death, but that he had been overwhelmed with many and various deaths,
   now adds his gratitude to the Lord for having delivered him, Thou, he
   says, hast made my life to ascend from the grave, O Jehovah. He again
   confirms what I have once said, -- that he did not pour forth empty
   prayers, but that he prayed with an earnest feeling, and in faith: for
   he would not have called him his God, except he was persuaded of his
   paternal love, so as to be able to expect from him a certain salvation.
   Thou, then, Jehovah, my God, he says; he does not say, Thou hast
   delivered me, but, Thou hast brought forth my life from the grave. Then
   Jonah, brought to life again, testifies here that he was not only
   delivered by God's aid from the greatest danger, but that he had, by a
   certain kind of resurrection, been raised from the dead. This is the
   meaning of this mode of speaking, when he says that his life had been
   brought forth from the grave, or from corruption itself. It follows --

   Jonah 2:7

   7. When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer
   came in unto thee, into thine holy temple.

   7. Quum deficeret in me anima mea (vel, dum se convolveret supra me
   anima mea,) Jehovae recordatus sum, et ingressa est oratio mea ad
   templum sanctitatis tuae.


   Here Jonah comprehends in one verse what he had previously said, --
   that he had been distressed with the heaviest troubles, but that he had
   not yet been so cast down in his mind, as that he had no prospect of
   God's favor to encourage him to pray. He indeed first confesses that he
   had suffered some kind of fainting, and that he had been harassed by
   anxious and perplexing thoughts, so as not to be able by his own
   efforts to disengage himself.

   As to the word tph, otheph, it means in Hebrew to hide, to cover; but
   in Niphal and Hithpael (in which conjugation it is found here) it
   signifies to fail: but its former meaning might still be suitably
   retained here; then it would be, My soul hid or rolled up itself,' as
   it is in Psalm 102:1, The prayer of the afflicted, when he rolled up
   himself in his distress.' They who render it, he multiplied prayers,
   have no reason to support them. I therefore doubt not but that Jonah
   here means, either that he had been overcome by a swoon, or that he had
   been so perplexed as not to be able without a violent struggle to raise
   up his mind to God. However it may have been, he intended by this word
   to express the anxiety of his mind. While then we are tossed about by
   divers thoughts, and remain, as it were, bound up in a hopeless
   condition, then our soul may be said to roll or to fold up itself
   within us. When therefore the soul rolls up itself, all the thoughts of
   man in perplexity recoil on himself. We may indeed seek to disburden
   ourselves while we toss about various purposes, but whatever we strive
   to turn away from us, soon comes back on our own head; thus our soul
   recoils upon us. We now perceive what Jonah meant by this clause, When
   my soul infolded itself, or failed within me, I remembered, he says,
   Jehovah. We hence learn that Jonah became not a conqueror without the
   greatest difficulties, not until his soul, as we have said, had
   fainted: this is one thing. Then we learn, also, that he was not so
   oppressed with distresses but that he at length sought God by prayer.
   Jonah therefore retained this truth, that God was to be sought, however
   severely and sharply he treated him for a time; for the remembering, of
   which he speaks, proceeded from faith. The ungodly also remember
   Jehovah, but they dread him, for they look on him as a judge; and
   whenever a mention is made of God, they expect nothing but destruction:
   but Jonah applied the remembrance of God to another purpose, even as a
   solace to ease his cares and his anxieties.

   For it immediately follows, that his prayer had penetrated unto God, or
   entered before him. [39] We then see that Jonah so remembered his God,
   that by faith he knew that he would be propitious to him; and hence was
   his disposition to pray. But by saying that his prayer entered into his
   temple, he no doubt alludes to a custom under the law; for the Jews
   were wont to turn themselves towards the temple whenever they prayed:
   nor was this a superstitious ceremony; for we know that they were
   instructed in the doctrine which invited them to the sanctuary and the
   ark of the covenant. Since then this was the custom under the law,
   Jonah says that his prayer entered into the temple of God; for that was
   a visible symbol, through which the Jews might understand that God was
   near to them; not that they by a false imagination bound God to
   external signs, but because they knew that these helps Had not in vain
   been given to them. So then Jonah not only remembered his God, but
   called also to mind the signs and symbols in which he had exercised his
   faith, as we have just said through the whole course of his life; for
   they who view him as referring to heaven, depart wholly from what the
   Prophet meant. We indeed know that the temple sometimes means heaven;
   but this sense suits not this place. Then Jonah meant that though he
   was far away from the temple, God was yet near to him; for he had not
   ceased to pray to that God who had revealed himself by the law which he
   gave, and who had expressed his will to be worshipped at Jerusalem, and
   also had been pleased to appoint the ark as the symbol of his presence,
   that the Jews might, with an assured faith, call upon him, and that
   they might not doubt but that he dwelt in the midst of them, inasmuch
   as he had there his visible habitation.

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast once given us such an evidence
   of thy infinite power in thy servant Jonah, whose mind, when he was
   almost sunk down into hell, thou hadst yet raised up to thyself, and
   hadst so supported with firm constancy, that he ceased not to pray and
   to call on thee, -- O grant, that in the trials by which we must be
   daily exercised, we may raise upwards our minds to thee, and never
   cease to think that thou art near us; and that when the signs of thy
   wrath appear, and when our sins thrust themselves before our eyes, to
   drive us to despair, may we still constantly struggle, and never
   surrender the hope of thy mercy, until having finished all our
   contests, we may at length freely and fully give thanks to thee, and
   praise thy infinite goodness, such as we daily experience that being
   conducted through continual trials, we may at last come into that
   blessed rest which is laid up for us in heaven, through Christ one
   Lord. Amen.

   Jonah 2:8-9

   8. They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.

   8. Qui observant vanitates mendaces, misericordiam suam (vel,
   clementiam) derelinquent (hoc est, derelinquunt.)

   9. But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I
   will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the Lord

   9. Ego autem in voce laudis sacrificabo tibi, quae vovi reddam: salus
   est Jehovae.


   Here Jonah says first, that men miserably go astray, when they turn
   aside to vain superstitions, for they rob themselves of the chief good:
   for he calls whatever help or aid that is necessary for salvation, the
   mercy of men. The sense then is that as soon as men depart from God,
   they depart from life and salvation, and that nothing is retained by
   them, for they willfully cast aside whatever good that can be hoped and
   desired. Some elicit a contrary meaning, that the superstitious, when
   they return to a sound mind, relinquish their own reproach; for chsd,
   chesad, sometimes means reproach. They then think that the way of true
   penitence is here described, -- that when God restores men from their
   straying to the right way, he gives them at the same time a sound mind,
   so that they rid themselves from all their vices. This is indeed true,
   but it is too strained a meaning. Others confine this to the sailors
   who vowed sacrifices to God; as though Jonah had said, that they would
   soon relapse to their own follies, and bid adieu to God, who in his
   mercy had delivered them from shipwreck; so they explain their mercy to
   be God; but this is also too forced an explanation.

   I doubt not, therefore, but that Jonah here sets his own religion in
   opposition to his false intentions of men; for it immediately follows,
   But I with the voice of praise will sacrifice to thee. Jonah, then,
   having before confessed that he would be thankful to God, now pours
   contempt on all those inventions which men foolishly contrive for
   themselves, and through which they withdraw themselves from the only
   true God, and from the sincere worship of him. For he calls all those
   devices, by which men deceive themselves, the vanities of falsehood;
   [40] for it is certain that they are mere fallacies which men invent
   for themselves without the authority of God's Word; for truth is one
   and simple, which God has revealed to us in his world. Whosoever then
   turns aside the least, either on this or on that side, seeks, as it
   were designedly, some imposture or another, by which he ruins himself.
   They then who follow such vanities, says Jonah, forsake their own
   mercy, [41] that is they reject all happiness: for no aid and no help
   can be expected from any other quarter than from the only true God.

   But this passage deserves a careful notice; for we hence learn what
   value to attach to all superstitions, to all those opinions of men,
   when they attempt to set up religion according to their own will: for
   Jonah calls them lying or fallacious vanities. There is then but one
   true religion, the religion which God has taught us in his word. We
   must also notice, that men in vain weary themselves when they follow
   their own inventions; for the more strenuously they run, the farther
   they recede from the right way, as Augustine has well observed. But
   Jonah here adopts a higher principle, -- that God alone possesses in
   himself all fullness of blessings: whosoever then truly and sincerely
   seeks God, will find in him whatever can be wished for salvation. But
   God is not to be sought but by obedience and faith: whosoever then dare
   to give themselves loose reins, so as to follow this or that without
   the warrant of God's word, recede from God, and, at the same time,
   deprive themselves of all good things. The superstitious do indeed
   think that they gain much when they toil in their own inventions; but
   we see what the Holy Spirit declares by the mouth of Jonah. The Lord
   says the same by Jeremiah

   "They have forsaken me, the fountain of living water, and cisterns have
   they digged for themselves," (Jeremiah 2:13.)

   There the Lord complains of his chosen people, who had gone astray
   after wicked superstitions. Hence, when men wander beyond the word of
   God, they in a manner renounce God, or say adieu to him; and thus they
   deprive themselves of all good things; for without God there is no
   salvation and no help to be found.

   Jonah therefore rightly adds, But I, with the voice of praise, will
   sacrifice to thee; as though he said While men as it were banish
   themselves from God, by giving themselves up to errors, I will
   sacrifice to thee and to thee alone, O Lord. And this ought to be
   observed by us; for as our minds are prone to falsehood and vanity, any
   new superstition will easily lay hold so us, except we be restrained by
   this bond, except we be fully persuaded, -- that true salvation dwells
   in God alone, and every aid and help that can be expected by us: but
   when this conviction is really and thoroughly fixed in our hearts, then
   true religion cannot be easily lost by us: though Satan should on every
   side spread his allurements, we shall yet continue in the true and
   right worship of God. And the more carefully it behaves us to consider
   this passage, because Jonah no doubt meant here to strengthen himself
   in the right path of religion; for he knew that like all mortals he was
   prone to what was false; he therefore encouraged himself to persevere:
   and this he does, when he declares that whatever superstition men
   devise, is a deprivation of the chief good, even of life and salvation.
   It will hence follow, that we shall abominate every error when we are
   fully persuaded that we forsake the true God whenever we obey not his
   word, and that we at the same time cast away salvation, and every thing
   good that can be desired. Then Jonah says, I will sacrifice to thee
   with the voice of praise.

   It must be noticed here farther, that the worship of God especially
   consists in praises, as it is said in Psalm 1:1: for there God shows
   that he regards as nothing all sacrifices, except they answer this end
   -- to set forth the praise of his name. It was indeed his will that
   sacrifices should be offered to him under the law; but it was for the
   end just stated: for God cares not for calves and oxen, for goats and
   lambs; but his will was that he should be acknowledged as the Giver of
   all blessings. Hence he says there, Sacrifice to me the sacrifice of
   praise.' So also Jonah now says, I will offer to thee the sacrifice of
   praise, and he might have said with still more simplicity, "Lord, I
   ascribe to thee my preserved life." But if this was the case under the
   shadows of the law, how much more ought we to attend to this, that is,
   -- to strive to worship God, not in a gross manner, but spiritually,
   and to testify that our life proceeds from him, that it is in his hand,
   that we owe all things to him, and, in a word, that he is the Source
   and Author of salvation, and not only of salvation, but also of wisdom,
   of righteousness, of power?

   And he afterwards mentions his vows, I will pay, he says, my vows. We
   have stated elsewhere in what light we are to consider vows. The holy
   Fathers did not vow to God, as the Papists of this day are wont to do,
   who seek to pacify God by their frivolous practices; one abstains for a
   certain time from meat, another puts on sackcloth, another undertakes a
   pilgrimage, and another obtrudes on God some new ceremony. There was
   nothing of this kind in the vows of the holy Fathers; but a vow was the
   mere act of thanksgiving, or a testimony of gratitude: and so Jonah
   joins his vows here with the sacrifice of praise. We hence learn that
   they were not two different things; but he repeats the same thing
   twice. Jonah, then, had declared his vow to God for no other purpose
   but to testify his gratitude.

   And hence he adds, To Jehovah is, or belongs, salvation; that is, to
   save is the prerogative of God alone; Jehovah is here in the dative
   case, for prefixed to it is l, lamed. It is then to Jehovah that
   salvation belongs; the work of saving appertains to no other but to the
   Supreme God. Since it is so, we see how absurd and insane men are, when
   they transfer praises to another, as every one does who invents an idol
   for himself. As, then, there is but the one true God who saves, it
   behaves us to ascribe to him alone all our praises, that we may not
   deprive him of his right. This is the import of the whole. It follows
   --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [40] hvly-sv', "Idols of vanity or falsehood," i.e., false, or
   deceitful, or vain idols. hvl means vapor, smoke, breath, vanity,
   inanity: but in the plural number it is applied for the most part to
   idols. See Deuteronomy 32:21; 1 Kings 16:13, 26 sv' is a lie, which is
   vain -- useless, and false -- deceptive. Marckius renders the words,
   "Vanitates inanitatis -- vanities of inanity'" Junius and Tremelius,
   "Vanitates mendaces -- mendacious vanities;" Septuagint, "mataia kai
   Pseude -- vain and false things." "He thus calls idols," says an author
   in Poole's Syn., "and all those things in which any one, excluding God,
   trusts; which are nothing, and can do nothing, and which deceive their
   worshippers." This is true, that is, that all other things, as well as
   idols, are, apart from God, vain, and worthless, and deceptive; but the
   reference here no doubt is to idols. They are not only empty, but
   deceptive. -- Ed.

   [41] chsdm yzvv, "Their mercy or goodness they forsake," that is, the
   mercy exhibited and offered to them by God; or, if we render it
   goodness, it means their chief good, which is God. The Psalmist calls
   God his goodness in Psalm 144:2, chsdy, "my goodness," the giver of all
   his goodness, or his chief good. Dathius gives very correctly the
   meaning of the two lines in these words -- "Qui vana idola colunt,
   Felicitatis suae auctorem deserunt --
   They who worship vain idols,
   Desert the author of their own happiness." More literally -- "They who
   attend on the idols of vanity,
   Their own goodness forsake." There is a contrast between vain idols and
   their own goodness, that is, the goodness received by them from God.
   Grotius gives this paraphrase, "They who worship idols are vain; for
   they forsake their own mercy, that is, God, who is able to help them in
   their distress." Henry suggests another view, "They who follow their
   own inventions, as Jonah had done, when he fled from the presence of
   the lord to go to Tarshish, forsake their own mercy, that mercy which
   they may find in God." -- Ed.

   Jonah 2:10

   10. And the Lord spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the
   dry land

   10. Et dixit Jehovah pisci (hoc est, praecepit;) et evomuit Jonam super
   aridam.


   The deliverance of Jonah is here in few words described; but how
   attentively ought we to consider the event? It was an incredible
   miracle, that Jonah should have continued alive and safe in the bowels
   of the fish for three days. For how was it that he was not a thousand
   times smothered or drowned by waters? We know that fish continually
   draw in water: Jonah could not certainly respire while in the fish; and
   the life of man without breathing can hardly continue for a minute.
   Jonah, then, must have been preserved beyond the power of nature. Then
   how could it have been that the fish should cast forth Jonah on the
   shore, except God by his unsearchable power had drawn the fish there?
   Again, who could have supernaturally opened its bowels and its mouth?
   His coming forth, then, was in every way miraculous, yea, it was
   attended with many miracles.

   But Jonah, that he might the more extol the infinite power of God,
   adopted the word said. Hence we learn that nothing is hard to God, for
   he could by a nod only effect so great a thing as surpasses all our
   conceptions. If Jonah had said that he was delivered by God's kindness
   and favor, it would have been much less emphatical, than when he adopts
   a word which expresses a command, And Jehovah spake, or said, to the
   fish.

   But as this deliverance of Jonah is an image of the resurrection, this
   is an extraordinary passage, and worthy of being especially noticed;
   for the Holy Spirit carries our minds to that power by which the world
   was formed and is still wonderfully preserved. That we may then,
   without hesitation and doubt, be convinced of the restoration which God
   promises to us, let us remember that the world was by him created out
   of nothing by his word and bidding, and is still thus sustained. But if
   this general truth is not sufficient, let this history of Jonah come to
   our minds, -- that God commanded a fish to cast forth Jonah: for how
   was it that Jonah escaped safe and was delivered? Even because it so
   pleased God, because the Lord commanded; and this word at this day
   retains the same efficacy. By that power then, by which he works all
   things, we also shall one day be raised up from the dead. Now follows
   --

   Chapter 3.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jonah 3:1-2

   1. And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying,

   1. Et factum fuit verbum Jehovae ad Jonam secundo, dicendo, --

   2. Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the
   preaching that I bid thee.

   2. Surge, proficiscere Nineven in urbem magnam, et praedica ad eam
   praedicationem quam ego mando tibi.


   There is here set before us a remarkable proof of God's grace, -- that
   he was pleased to bestow on Jonah his former dignity and honor. He was
   indeed unworthy of the common light, but God not only restored him to
   life, but favored him again with the office and honor of a prophet.
   This, as I have said, Jonah obtained through the wonderful and singular
   favor of God. As he had previously fled, and by disobedience deprived
   himself in a manner of all God's favor, the recovery of his prophetic
   office was certainly not obtained through his own merit.

   It must, in the first place, be observed, that this phrase, The word of
   Jehovah came the second time, ought to be noticed; for the word of God
   comes to men in different ways. God indeed addresses each of us
   individually; but he spoke to his Prophets in a special manner; for he
   designed them to be witnesses and heralds of his will. Hence, whenever
   God sets a man in some peculiar office, his word is said to come to
   him: as the word of God is addressed to magistrates because they are
   commanded to exercise the power committed to them; so also the word of
   God ever came to the Prophets, because it was not lawful for them to
   thrust in themselves without being called.

   The command now follows, Arise, go to Nineveh, to that great city, and
   preach there the preaching which I command thee. [42] God again repeats
   what we have observed at the be ginning, -- that Nineveh was a great
   city, that Jonah might provide himself with an invincible courage of
   mind, and come there well prepared: for it often happens, that many
   boldly undertake an office, but soon fail, because difficulties had not
   been sufficiently foreseen by them. Hence, when men find more hardships
   than they thought of at the beginning, they nearly faint, at least they
   despond. The Lord, therefore, expressly foretold Jonah how difficult
   would be his employment; as though he said, "I send thee, a man
   unknown, and of no rank, and a stranger, to denounce ruin on men, not a
   few in number, but on a vast multitude, and to carry on a contest with
   the noblest city, and so populous, that it may seem to be a region of
   itself."

   We now then understand why this character of the city was added; it
   was, that Jonah might gird up himself for the contest, that he might
   not afterwards fail in the middle of his course. This fear indeed
   frightened him at the beginning, so that he shunned the call of God;
   but he is not now moved in any degree by the greatness of the city, but
   resolutely follows where the Lord leads. We hence see, that faith, when
   once it gains the ascendancy in our hearts, surmounts all obstacles and
   despises all the greatness of the world; for it is immediately added --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [42] Literally, "And proclaim to or against her the proclamation which
   I declare to thee." The Septuagint is, "Kai keruxon en aute kata to
   kerugma to emprosthen o` ego elalesa pros se -- And preach in it the
   former preaching which I have spoken to thee." lyh in five MSS., as in
   chapter 1:2, "against her," and not 'lyh, "to her." 'sr 'nky dvr 'lyd,
   "which I am speaking or declaring to thee." dvr is a participle; being
   preceded by a nominative, it will admit of an auxiliary verb either in
   the past, present or future tense, according to the context; though it
   is often used to express the present time. Newcome renders the sentence
   thus -- "And cry unto her in the words which I shall speak unto thee;"
   Henderson more paraphrastically thus -- "And make the proclamation to
   it which I order thee;" and adds the following remarks, -- "Be my
   herald, and faithfully deliver my message. The word kerux in Greek
   answers to the Hebrew qvr', kore, both signifying a crier, a herald, a
   preacher; one that makes proclamation with a loud and earnest cry. Such
   was John Baptist, Isaiah 40:3; such was Jesus Christ, John 7:18-37; and
   such were all his apostles. And such earnestness becomes a ministry
   that has to do with immortal souls, asleep and dead in sin, hanging on
   the brink of perdition, and insensible of their state. The soft
   speaking, gentle toned, unmoved preacher, is never likely to awaken
   souls." Henry considers that the commission was not specifically
   explained to him then. "Jonah must go," he says, "with implicit faith:
   he shall not know till he comes thither what message he must deliver."
   -- Ed.

   Jonah 3:3

   3. So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the
   Lord. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days' journey.

   3. Et surrexit Jonah et profectus est Nineven, secundum mandatum
   Jehovae: Nineveh autem erat urbs magna Dei (Deo, ad verbum) itinere
   trium dierum.


   Jonah, by saying that he went to Nineveh according to God's command,
   proves in the first place, as I have said, how great was the power and
   energy of his faith; for though Jonah had considered the greatness and
   pride of the city, he seems to have forgotten that he was an obscure
   man, alone, and unarmed; but he had laid hold on weapons capable of
   destroying all the power of the world, for he knew that he was sent
   from above. His conviction was, that God was on his side; and he knew
   that God had called him. Hence then it was, that with a high and
   intrepid mind he looked down on all the splendor of the city Nineveh.
   Hence John does not without reason say, that the victory, by which we
   overcome the world, proceeds from faith, (1 John 5:4.) Jonah also
   proves, at the same time, how much he had improved under God's
   scourges. He had been severely chastised; but we know that most of the
   unbelieving grow hardened under the rod, and vomit forth their rage
   against God; Jonah, on the contrary, shows here that chastisement had
   been useful to him for he was subdued and led to obey God.

   He went, then, according to the command of Jehovah; that is, nothing
   else did he regard but to render obedience to God, and to suffer
   himself to be wholly ruled by him. We hence learn how well God provides
   for us and for our salvation, when he corrects our perverseness; though
   sharp may be our chastisements, yet as this benefit follows we know
   that nothing is better for us than to be humbled under God's hand, as
   David says in Psalm 119:1. This change then, he went, is to us a
   remarkable example; and this is what the Lord has ever in view whenever
   he roughly handles us; for he cannot otherwise subdue either the
   haughtiness or the rebellion, or the slowness and indolence of our
   flesh. We must now also take notice how Jonah attained so much
   strength; it was, because he had found by experience in the bowels of
   the fish, that even amidst thousand deaths there is enough in God's
   protection to secure our safety. As then he had by experience known
   that the issues of death are at the will and in the hand of God, he is
   not now touched with fear so as to shun God's command, even were the
   whole world to rise up against him. Hence the more any one has found
   the kindness of God, the more courageously he ought to proceed in the
   discharge of his office, and confidently to commit to God his life and
   his safety, and resolutely to surmount all the perils of the world.

   He then says, that Nineveh was a great city [43] , even a journey of
   three days. Some toil much in untying a knot, which at last is no knot
   at all; for it seems to them strange that one city should be in compass
   about thirty leagues according to our measure. When they conceive this
   as being impossible, then they invent some means to avoid the
   difficulty, -- that no one could visit the whole city so as to go
   through all the alleys, all the streets, and all the public places,
   except in three days; nay, they add, that this is not to be understood
   as though one ran or quickly passed through the city, but as though he
   walked leisurely and made a stay in public places: but these are mere
   puerilities. And if we believe profane writers, Nineveh must have been
   a great city, as Jonah declares here: for they say that its area was
   about four hundred stadia; and we know what space four hundred stadia
   include. A stadium is one hundred and twenty-five paces; hence eight
   stadia make a mile. Now if any one will count he will find that there
   are twelve miles in a hundred stadia; there will then be in four
   hundred stadia forty-eight miles. This account well agrees with the
   testimony of Jonah. And then Diodorus and Herodotus say that there were
   1500 towers around the city. Since it was so, it could not certainly be
   a smaller city than what it is represented here by Jonah. Though these
   things may seem to exceed what is commonly believed, writers have not
   yet reported them without some foundation: for however false are found
   to be many things in Diodorus and Herodotus, yet as to Babylon and
   Nineveh they could not have dared to say what was untrue; for the first
   was then standing and known to many; and the ruins of the other were
   still existing, though it had been for some time destroyed. We shall
   farther see about the end of the book that this city was large, and so
   populous, that there were there 120,000 children. If any one receives
   not this testimony, let him feed on the lies of the devil. But since
   there were so many children there, what else can we say but that the
   circumference of the city was very great?

   But this seems inconsistent with what immediately follows; for Jonah
   says, that when he entered the city, he performed a journey in the city
   for one day and preached. The answer is this, -- that as soon as he
   entered the city, and began to proclaim the command of God, some
   conversions immediately followed: so Jonah does not mean that he went
   through the city in one day. He then in the first day converted a part
   of the city; he afterwards continued to exhort each one to repentance:
   thus the conversion of the whole city followed; but not in the second
   or the third day, as it may be easily gathered. Let us now proceed to
   what remains --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [43] The original is, "And Nineveh was a city great to God" -- l'lhym
   yr-gdvlh. The remark of Henry is, "So the Hebrew phrase is, meaning no
   more than as we render it, exceeding great; this honor that language
   doth to the great God, that great things derive their denomination from
   him" Though the form of the expression here is different from what we
   find in other places, when God is taken in this sense, as in Psalm
   80:10, 'rzy-'l, cedars of God, that is, tall or great cedars, -- yet
   there is no other sense that comports with this place. This is the view
   of Dathius, Drusius, Newcome, and many others. Some render it, great
   through God, and Grotius seems to have taken it in this sense, for he
   explains it by "Deo eam augente -- God having increased it." Henderson
   considers l here in the sense of lphgy, before, and refers to Genesis
   10:9. But this has hardly a meaning in this connection. -- Ed..

   Jonah 3:4

   4. And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he
   cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.

   4. Et coepit Jonah ingredi in urbem itinere diei unius, et clamavit et
   dixit, Adhuc quadraginta dies et Nineveh subversa.


   Jonah here relates what had briefly been said before, -- that he went
   to Nineveh according to the command of God. He shows then how
   faithfully he executed the duty enjoined on him, and thus obeyed the
   word of God. Hence Jonah came and began to enter the city and to preach
   on the first day. This promptness proves clearly how tractable Jonah
   had become, and how much he endeavored to obey God in discharging his
   office: for had there been still a timidity in his heart, he would have
   inspected the city, as careful and timid men are wont to do, who
   inquire what is the condition of the place, what are the dispositions
   of the people, and which is the easiest access to them, and what is the
   best way, and where is the least danger. If Jonah then had been still
   entangled by carnal thoughts he would have waited two or three days,
   and then have began to exercise his office as a Prophet. This he did
   not, but entered the city and I cried. We now then see how prompt he
   was in his obedience, who had before attempted to pass over the sea: he
   now takes hardly a moment to breathe, but he begins at the very
   entrance to testify that he had come in obedience to God.

   We hence see with what emphasis these words ought to be read. The
   narrative is indeed very simple; Jonah uses here no rhetorical
   ornaments, nor does he set forth his entrance with any fine display of
   words. Jonah, he says, entered into the city He who is not well versed
   in Scripture might say that this is frigid: but when we weigh the
   circumstances, we see that this simple way of speaking possesses more
   force and power than all the displays of orators.

   He entered then the city a day's journey, and cried and said, etc. By
   saying that he cried, he again proves the courage of his soul; for he
   did not creep in privately, as men are wont to do, advancing cautiously
   when dangers are apprehended. He says that he cried: then this freedom
   shows that Jonah was divested of all fear, and endued with such
   boldness of spirit, that he raised himself up above all the hindrances
   of the world. And we ought, in the meantime, to remember how disliked
   must have been his message: for he did not gently lead the Ninevites to
   God, but threatened them with destruction, and seemed to have given
   them no hope of pardon. Jonah might have thought that his voice, as one
   says, would have to return to his own throat, "Can I denounce ruin on
   this populous city, without being instantly crushed? Will not the first
   man that meets me stone me to death?" Thus might Jonah have thought
   within himself. No fear was, however, able to prevent him from doing
   his duty as a faithful servant, for he had been evidently strengthened
   by the Lord. But it will be better to join the following verse --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jonah 3:5

   5. So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and
   put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.

   5. Et crediderunt viri Ninevae Deo, et indixerunt jejunium, et
   induerunt saccos a magno eorum usque ad parvum eorum.


   One thing, escaped me in the third verse: Jonah said that Nineveh was a
   city great to God. This form of speech is common in Scripture: for the
   Hebrews call that Divine, whatever it be, that is superior or
   excellent: so they say, the cedars of God, the mountains of God, the
   fields of God, when they are superior in height or in any other
   respect. Hence a city is called the city of God, when it is beyond
   others renowned. I wished briefly to allude to this subject, because
   some, with too much refinement and even puerility says that it was
   called the city of God, because it was the object of God's care, and in
   which he intended to exhibit a remarkable instance of conversion. But,
   as I have said, this is to be taken as the usual mode of speaking in
   similar cases.

   I now return to the text: Jonah says, that the citizens of Nineveh
   believed God [44] . We hence gather that the preaching of Jonah was not
   so concise but that he introduced his discourse by declaring that he
   was God's Prophet, and that he did not proclaim these commands without
   authority; and we also gather that Jonah so denounced ruin, that at the
   same time he showed God to be the avenger of sins that he reproved the
   Ninevites, and, as it were, summoned them to God's tribunal, making
   known to them their guilt; for had he spoken only of punishment, it
   could not certainly have been otherwise, but that the Ninevites must
   have rebelled furiously against God; but by showing to them their
   guilt, he led them to acknowledge that the threatened punishment was
   just, and thus he prepared them for humility and penitence. Both these
   things may be collected from this expression of Jonah, that the
   Ninevites believed God; for were they not persuaded that the command
   came from heaven, what was their faith? Let us then know, that Jonah
   had so spoken of his vocation, that the Ninevites felt assured that he
   was a celestial herald: hence was their faith: and further, the
   Ninevites would never have so believed as to put on sackcloth, had they
   not been reminded of their sins. There is, therefore, no doubt but that
   Jonah, while crying against Nineveh, at the same time made known how
   wickedly the men lived, and how grievous were their offenses against
   God. Hence then it was that they put on sackcloth, and suppliantly fled
   to God's mercy: they understood that they were deservedly summoned to
   judgment on account of their wicked lives.

   But it may be asked, how came the Ninevites to believe God, as no hope
   of salvation was given them? for there can be no faith without an
   acquaintance with the paternal kindness of God; whosoever regards God
   as angry with him must necessarily despair. Since then Jonah gave them
   no knowledge of God's mercy, he must have greatly terrified the
   Ninevites, and not have called them to faith. The answer is, that the
   expression is to be taken as including a part for the whole; for there
   is no perfect faith when men, being called to repentance, do
   suppliantly humble themselves before God; but yet it is a part of
   faith; for the Apostle says, in Hebrew 11:7, that Noah through faith
   feared; he deduces the fear which Noah entertained on account of the
   oracular word he received, from faith, showing thereby that it was
   faith in part, and pointing out the source from which it proceeded. At
   the same time, the mind of the holy Patriarch must have been moved by
   other things besides threatening, when he built an ark for himself, as
   the means of safety. We may thus, by taking a part for the whole,
   explain this, place, -- that the Ninevites believed God; for as they
   knew that God required the deserved punishment, they submitted to him,
   and, at the same time, solicited pardon: but the Ninevites, no doubt,
   derived from the words of Jonah something more than mere terror: for
   had they only apprehended this -- that they were guilty before God, and
   were justly summoned to punishment, they would have been confounded and
   stunned with dread, and could never have been encouraged to seek
   forgiveness. Inasmuch then as they suppliantly prostrated themselves
   before God, they must certainly have conceived some hope of grace. They
   were not, therefore, so touched with penitence and the fear of God, but
   that they had some knowledge of divine grace: thus they believed God;
   for though they were aware that they were most worthy of death, they
   yet despaired not, but retook themselves to prayer. Since then we see
   that the Ninevites sought this, remedy, we must feel assured that they
   derived more advantage from the preaching of Jonah than the mere
   knowledge that they were guilty before God: this ought certainly to be
   understood. But we shall speak more on the subject in our next lecture.

   [44] vy'mynv v'lhym, "And they believed in God. The verb 'mn in Hiphil
   is ever followed by v or l, except in one instance by 't in Judges
   11:20. When followed by v it seems to mean, to give credit to what is
   said, to believe one's testimony, or the truth of what is referred to.
   To believe then in God is to believe the truth of what he declares, to
   believe his word. Hence in 2 Chronicles 20:20, Jehosophat said to the
   people, "Believe in the Lord your God," h'mynv vyhvh 'lhykm; and he
   adds, "Believe [in] his Prophets," h'mynv vnvy'yv. It is the word of
   God, and the word of the Prophets, which was the same, or the truth or

   thy commandments," vmtsvtyk, that is, in the truth of thy commandments.
   -- When the verb in Hiphil is followed by l, the idea of reliance or
   dependance is more especially conveyed, though in many instances there
   is hardly a difference tobe recognized, except the context be minutely
   observed. Among other passages, the verb in its Hiphil form is followed
   by v, in Genesis 15:6, Exodus 14:31, Numbers 20:12, 2 Kings 17:14,
   Proverbs 26:25, Jeremiah 12:6; -- and by l in Exodus 4:1-8, Deuteronomy

   Septuagint renders believing in God by episteusan to theo: so does Paul
   in Romans 4:3, Galatians 3:6; but he retains the Hebrew form in Romans
   4:5, pisteuonti epi ton, etc. Calvin here conveys the same meaning by
   "crediderunt Deo -- believed God:" that is, the Ninevites gave credit
   to what God declared by Jonah, they believed God's word. -- Ed.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as there is so much timidity in us, that none
   of us is prepared to follow where thou mayest call us, we may be so
   instructed by the example of thy servant Jonah, as to obey thee in
   every thing, and that though Satan and the world may oppose us with all
   their terrors, we may yet be strengthened by a reliance on thy power
   and protection, which thou hast promised to us, and may go on in the
   course of our vocation, and never turn aside, but thus contend against
   all the hindrances of this world, until we reach that celestial
   kingdom, where we shall enjoy thee and Christ thy only begotten Son,
   who is our strength and our salvation: and may thy Spirit quicken us,
   and strengthen all our faculties, that we may obey thee, and that at
   length thy name may be glorified in us, and that we may finally become
   partakers of that glory to which thou invites us through Christ our
   Lord. Amen.

   Jonah 3:6-8

   6. For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his
   throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth,
   and sat in ashes.

   6. Et pervenit verbum (sermo, vel, res) ad regem Nineveh; et surrexit e
   solio suo, et abjecit splendidam suam vestem a seipso, et induit
   saccum, et sedit super pulverem:

   7. And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by
   the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor
   beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink
   water:

   7. Et promulgavit ac dixit per Nineveh ex consilio regis et magnatum
   ejus, dicendo, Homo et jumentum (vel, bestia,) bos et ovis, ne gustent
   quidpiam, ne pascantur, et ne aquas bibant;

   8. But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily
   unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the
   violence that is in their hands.

   8. Et induantur saccis homo et bestia, et clament ad Deum in
   fortitudine; et revertatur quisque a via sua mala, et a rapacitate quae
   est in manibus eorum.


   It is uncertain whether Jonah had preached for some days in the city
   before it was known to the king. This is indeed the common opinion; for
   interpreters so expound the verse, which says that word was brought to
   the king, as though the king himself knew, that the whole city was in
   commotion through the preaching of Jonah: but the words admit of a
   different sense, that is that the preaching of Jonah immediately
   reached the king; and I am disposed to take this view, as Jonah seems
   here to explain how the Ninevites were led to put on sackcloth. He had
   before spoken briefly on the subject, but he now explains what took
   place more fully; and we know that it was commonly the manner of the
   Hebrews -- to relate the chief points in few words, and then to add an
   explanation. As then Jonah had said in the last verse that the
   Ninevites had put on sackcloth, and proclaimed a fast, so he now seems
   to express more distinctly how this happened, that is, through the
   royal edict. And it is by no means probable that a fast was proclaimed
   in the royal city by the mere consent of the people, as the king and
   his counselors were there present. Inasmuch then as it appears more
   reasonable that the edict respecting the fast had proceeded from the
   king, I am therefore inclined so to connect the two verses, as that the
   first briefly mentions the fruit which followed the preaching of Jonah,
   and that the second is added as an explanation, for it gives a fuller
   account of what took place.

   Jonah then now says, that a fast was proclaimed by the Ninevites, for
   the king and his council had so appointed: and I regard the verb vyg,
   uigo, as being in the pluperfect tense, When word had come to the king;
   [45] for Jonah now states the reason why the Ninevites proclaimed a
   fast; it was because the king had been apprised of the preaching of
   Jonah, and had called together his counselors. It was then a public
   edict, and not any movement among the people, capriciously made, as it
   sometimes happens. He says, that it was an edict published by the
   authority of the king and his council, or his nobles. At the same time,
   some take tm, thom, as meaning reason or approbation. tm, thom, means
   to taste, and Jonah afterwards uses the verb in this sense; but it is
   to be taken here in a metaphorical sense for counsel; And I think this
   meaning is more suitable to this passage. I come now to the subject.

   It is worthy of being noticed, that the king of so splendid a city [46]
   , nay, at that time the greatest monarch, should have rendered himself
   so submissive to the exhortation of Jonah: for we see how proud kings
   are; as they think themselves exempt from the common lot of men, so
   they carry themselves above all laws. Hence it comes, that they will
   have all things to be lawful for them; and while they give loose reins
   to their lusts they cannot bear to be admonished, even by their equals.
   But Jonah was a stranger and of a humble condition: that he therefore
   so touched the heart of the king, must be ascribed to the hidden power
   of God, which he puts forth through his word whenever he pleases. God
   does not indeed work alike by the preaching of his word, he does not
   always keep to the same course; but, when he pleases, he so
   efficaciously touches the hearts of men, that the success of his word
   exceeds all expectation, as in the memorable example presented to us
   here. Who could have said that a heathen king, who had ever lived
   according to his own will, who had no feeling as to true and genuine
   religion, would have been thus in an instant subdued? For he put aside
   his royal dress, laid himself in the dust, and clothed himself in
   sackcloth. We hence see that God not only spoke by the mouth of Jonah,
   but added power to his word.

   We must also bear in mind what Christ says, that the men of Nineveh
   would rise up in judgment against that generation, as they had repented
   at the preaching of Jonah; and "Behold," he said, "a greater than Jonah
   is here," (Matthew 12:41.) Christ, at this day, proclaims the voice of
   his Gospel; for though he is not here in a visible form among us, he
   yet speaks by his ministers. If we despise his doctrine, how can our
   obstinacy and hardness be excused, since the Ninevites, who had no
   knowledge of the true doctrine of religion, who were imbued with no
   religious principles, were so suddenly converted by the preaching of
   Jonah? And that their repentance was sincere we may conclude from this
   circumstance -- that the preaching of Jonah was severe, for he
   denounced destruction on a most powerful city; this might have
   instantly inflamed the king's mind with rage and fury; and that he was
   calmly humbled, was certainly a proof of no common change. We have then
   here a remarkable instance of penitence, -- that the king should have
   so forgotten himself and his dignity, as to throw aside his splendid
   dress, to put on sackcloth, and to lie down on ashes.

   But as to fasting and sackcloth, it is very true, as we have observed
   in our remarks on Joel, that repentance consists not in these external
   things: for God cares not for outward rites, and all those things which
   are resplendent in the sight of men are worthless before him; what
   indeed he requires, is sincerity of heart. Hence what Jonah here says
   of fasting, and other outward performances, ought to be referred to
   their legitimate end, -- that the Ninevites intended thus to show that
   they were justly summoned as guilty before God's tribunal, and also,
   that they humbly deprecated the wrath of their judge. Fasting then and
   sackcloth were only an external profession of repentance. Were any one
   to fast all his life, and to put on sackcloth, and to scatter dust on
   himself, and not to connect with all this a sincerity of heart, he
   would do nothing but mock God. [47] Hence these outward performances
   are, in themselves, of small or of no value, except when preceded by an
   interior feeling of heart, and men be on this account led to manifest
   such outward evidences. Whenever then Scripture mentions fasting, and
   ashes, and sackcloth, we must bear in mind that these things are set
   before us as the outward signs of repentance which when not genuine do
   nothing else but provoke the wrath of God; but when true, they are
   approved of God on account of the end in view, and not that they avail,
   of themselves, to pacify his wrath, or to expiate sins.

   If now any one asks whether penitence is always to be accompanied with
   fasting, ashes, and sackcloth, the answer is at hand, -- that the
   faithful ought through their whole life to repent: for except everyone
   of us continually strives to renounce himself and his former life, he
   has not yet learned what it is to serve God; for we must ever contend
   with the flesh. But though there is a continual exercise of repentance,
   yet fasting is not required of us always. It then follows that fasting
   is a public and solemn testimony of repentance, when there appears to
   be some extraordinary evidence of God's wrath. Thus have we seen that
   the Jews were by Joel called to lie in ashes, and to put on sackcloth
   because God had come forth, as it were, armed against them; and all the
   Prophets had declared that destruction was nigh the people. In the same
   manner the Ninevites, when terrified by this dreadful edict, put on
   sackcloth proclaimed a fasts because this was usually done in
   extremities. We now then perceive why the king, having himself put on
   sackcloth, enjoined on the whole people both fasting and other tokens
   of repentance.

   But it seems strange, and even ridiculous, that the king should bid
   animals, as well as men, to make a confession of repentance; for
   penitence is a change in man, when he returns to God after having been
   alienated from him: this cannot comport with the character of brute
   animals. Then the king of Nineveh acted foolishly and contrary to all
   reason in connecting animals with men when he spoke of repentance. But,
   in answer to this, we must bear in mind what I have before said -- that
   destruction had been denounced, not only on men, but also on the whole
   city, even on the buildings: for as God created the whole world for the
   sake of men, so also his wrath, when excited against men, includes the
   beasts, and trees, and every thing in heaven and on earth. But the
   question is not yet solved; for though God may punish animals on
   account of men's sins, yet neither oxen nor sheep can pacify the wrath
   of God. To this I answer -- that this was done for the sake of men: for
   it would have been ridiculous in the king to prohibit food and drink to
   animals, except he had a regard to men themselves. But his object was
   to set before the Ninevites, as in a mirror or picture, what they
   deserved. The same was done under the law; for, whenever they slew
   victims, they were reminded of their own sins; for it ought to have
   come to their minds, that the sheep or any other animal sacrificed was
   innocent, and that it stood at the altar in his stead who had sinned.
   They therefore saw in the ox, or the lamb, or the goat, a striking
   emblem of their own condemnation. So also the Ninevites, when they
   constrained the oxen, the asses and other animals, to fast, were
   reminded of what grievous and severe punishment they were worthy:
   inasmuch as innocent animals suffered punishment together with them. We
   hence see that no expiation was sought for by the king, when he
   enjoined a fast on brute animals, but that, on the contrary, men were
   roused by such means seriously to acknowledge the wrath of God, and to
   entertain greater fear, that they might be more truly humbled before
   him, and be displeased with themselves, and be thus more disposed and
   better prepared and moulded to seek pardon.

   We now then see that this must be considered as intended to terrify the
   consciences of men, that they, who had long flattered themselves, might
   by such a remedy be roused from their insensibility. The same was the
   intention of different washings under the law, the cleansing of
   garments and of vessels; it was, that the people might know that every
   thing they touched was polluted by their filth. And this ought to be
   especially observed; for the Papists, wedded as they are to external
   rites, lay hold on anything said in Scripture about fasting, and ashes,
   and sackcloth, and think that the whole of religion consists in these
   outward observances: but bodily exercise, as Paul says, profiteth but
   littler (1 Timothy 4:8.) Therefore this rule ought ever to be our guide
   -- that fasting and such things are in themselves of no value, but must
   be estimated only by the end in view. So then, when the animals were
   constrained by the Ninevites to suffer want, the men themselves, being
   reminded of their guilt, learned what it was to dread God's wrath; and
   on this account it was that fasting was approved by God.

   Now, if any one objects and says that nothing ought to be done in the
   worship of God beyond what his word warrants, the answer is -- that the
   king of Nineveh had not appointed any kind of expiation, neither did he
   intend that they should thus worship God, but regarded only the end
   which I have mentioned; and that end fully harmonizes with the word of
   God and his command. Hence the king of Nineveh attempted nothing that
   was inconsistent with the word of God, since he had in every thing this
   in view -- that he and his people might go humbly before God's
   tribunal, and with real penitential feelings solicit his forgiveness.
   This then is an answer sufficiently plain.

   When therefore Jonah afterwards subjoins, [48] that the king commanded
   both the people and the beasts to put on sackcloth, let us know, that
   if any one now were to take this as an example, he would be nothing
   else but a mountebank; for this reason ought ever to be remembered, --
   that the king sought aids by which he might lead himself and his people
   to true repentance. But the disposition of man is prone to imitate what
   is evil: for we are all very like apes; we ought therefore always to
   consider by what spirit those were actuated whom we wish to imitate,
   lest we should be contented with the outward form and neglect the main
   things.

   Jonah afterwards adds, And they cried mightily [49] to God This must be
   confined to men; for it could not have been applied to brute animals.
   Men then, as well as the beasts, abstained from meat and drink, and
   they cried to God. This crying could not have proceeded except from
   fear and a religious feeling: hence, as I have said, this cannot be
   applied indiscriminately to the beasts as well as to men. [50] But it
   deserves to be noticed, that the king of Nineveh commanded the people
   to cry mightily to God; for we hence learn that they were really
   frightened, inasmuch as he speaks not here of ordinary crying, but he
   adds mightily, as when we say, with all our power, or as we say in
   French, A force, or, fort et ferme. Jonah then expresses something
   uncommon and extraordinary, when he tells us that it was contained in
   the king's edict, that men should cry mightily to God; for it was the
   same as though he said, "Let all men now awake and shake off their
   indifference; for every one of us have hitherto greatly indulged
   ourselves in our vices: it is now time that fear should possess our
   minds, and also constrain us to deprecate the wrath of God." And it is
   also worthy of being observed, that the king proposes no other remedy,
   but that the people should have recourse to prayer. It might indeed
   have been, that Jonah exhorted the Ninevites to resort to this duty of
   religion, etc. We may, however, undeniably conclude that it is a
   feeling implanted in us by nature, that when we are pressed by
   adversities, we implore the favor of God. This then is the only remedy
   in afflictions and distresses, to pray to God. But when we, taught by
   the Law and by the Gospel, use not this remedy, whenever God warns us
   and exhorts us to repentance, what shadow of excuse can we have, since
   heathens, even those who understood not a syllable of true religion,
   yet prayed to God, and the king himself commanded this with the consent
   of his nobles? Hence this edict of the king ought to fill us with more
   shame than if one adduced the same doctrine only from the word of God:
   for though the authority of that king is not the same with that of God,
   yet when that miserable and blind prince acknowledged through the
   dictates of nature, that God is to be pacified by prayer, what excuse,
   as I have said, can remain for us?

   But Jonah shows more clearly afterwards, that it was no feigned
   repentance when the Ninevites put on sackcloth, and abstained also from
   meat and drink; for it follows in the kings edict, And let every one
   turn from his own wicked ways and from the plunder which is in their
   hands Here the heathen king shows for what purpose and with what design
   he had given orders respecting fasting and other things; it was done
   that the Ninevites might thus more effectually stimulate themselves to
   fear God; for he here exhorts them to turn from their evil way. By
   "way" the Scripture usually means the whole course or manner of man's
   life; it was as though he said, "Let every one of you change his
   disposition and his conduct; let us all become new creatures." And this
   is true penitence, the conversion of man to God; and this the heathen
   king meant. The more shameful then is their dullness who seek to pacify
   God by frivolous devices, as the Papists do; for while they obtrude on
   God trifles, I know not what, they think that these are so many
   expiations, and they tenaciously contend for them. They need no other
   judge than this heathen king, who shows that true penitence is wholly
   different, that it then only takes place when men become changed in
   mind and heart, and wholly turn to a better course of life.

   Let every one then turn, he says, from his evil way, and from the
   plunder [51] which is in their hand. One kind of evil is here
   subjoined, a part being stated for the whole, for plunders were not the
   only things which stood in need of amendment among the Ninevites, as it
   is probable that they were polluted by other vices and corruptions. In
   a city so large, drunkenness probably prevailed, as well as luxury, and
   pride, and ambition, and also lusts. It cannot indeed be doubted, but
   that Nineveh was filled with innumerable vices: but the king, by
   mentioning a part for the whole, points out here the principal vice,
   when he says, Let every one turn from his evil way, and from his
   rapacity. It was the same as though he had said that the principal
   virtue is equity or justice, that is, when men deal with one another
   without doing any hurt or injury: and well would it be were this
   doctrine to prevail at this day among all those who falsely assume the
   Christian name. For the Papists, though they accumulate expiations,
   pass by charity; and in the whole course of life equity has hardly any
   place. Let them then learn, from the mouth of a heathen king, what God
   principally requires from men, and approves of in their life, even to
   abstain from plunder and from the doing of any injury. We now then
   perceive why rapacity was especially mentioned. But we must bear in
   mind that the king, as yet a novice, and hardly in a slight degree
   imbued with the elements of religion, through hearing what Jonah
   preached, gave orders to his people according to the measure of his
   faith and knowledge: but if he made such progress in so short a time,
   what excuse can we pretend, whose ears have been stunned by continual
   preaching for twenty or thirty years, if we yet come short of the
   novitiate of this king? These circumstances ought then to be carefully
   observed by us. Let us now proceed --

   [45] Grotius, as well as Junius and Tremelius, had the same view of the
   verse, by rendering the verb in the tense here proposed. Quia
   pervenerat is the version of the former; and the version of the latter
   is, Quu enim pervenisset Our own version and that of Newcome seem also
   to favor this view, by rendering v "for," as giving a reason for what
   is said in the preceding verse: but Henderson has "and," and Marckius
   the same, and also the Septuagint. What Calvin states as to the manner
   of speaking often adopted in Hebre, is no doubt true. But Henry thinks
   that the people "led the way," and that what they commenced was
   afterwards enforced and made general by the order of the king and his
   nobles. -- Ed.

   [46] Who this king was is a matter of conjecture. "About thirteen
   years," says Newcome, "after the death of Jeroboam II., king of Israel,
   Pul, king of Assyria, invaded Israel. So that Pul, or his predecessor,
   may have been the king here mentioned." Others think that he was
   Sardanapalus, a character notorious in history for his luxurious,
   effeminate, and debauched life. -- Ed.

   [47] On te nesteia proseschen, alla te apoche ton kakon -- "He [God]
   did not regard fasting, but abstinence from evils." -- Theodoret. "It
   is not enough," says Henry, "to fast for sin, but we must fast from
   sin, and in order to the success of our prayers, must no more regard
   iniquity in our hearts... The work of a fast-day is not done with the
   day; no, then the hardest and most needful part of the work begins,
   which is to turn from sin, and to live a new life, and not to return
   with the dog to his vomit." -- Ed.

   [48] Calvin has omitted to notice the words at the beginning of the
   seventh verse. His version is, Et promulgavit ac dixit, etc., but this
   rendering comports not with what follows. The verbs are evidently in
   future Niphal, preceded by a v conversive, and ought to be rendered
   impersonally, "And it was proclaimed and published," etc. And so
   Newcome renders them; and this is in conformity with the Septuagint,
   Kai ekeruchthe kai errethe en te Nineue -- "And it was proclaimed and
   published in Nineveh." Henderson gives a paraphrase, "And a
   proclamation was made through Nineveh." -- Ed.

   [49] vchzqch, with vigor. "Ektesos -- intensely, earnestly." -- Sept.
   Vehementer -- vehemently." -- Grotius. "Totis viribus -- with all their
   powers." -- Mercerius. "Cum intensione valida -- with strong intensity"
   -- Marckius. "In prayer," says Henry, "we must cry mightily, with a
   fixedness of thought, firmness of faith, and fervor of pious and devout
   affections. -- Ed.

   [50] Yet Henry does in a manner apply this mighty crying to the beasts.
   "Let even the brute creatures do it according to their capacity; let
   their cries and moans for want of food be graciously construed as cries
   to God; as the cries of young ravens are, Job 38:41; and of the young
   lions, Psalm 104:21." -- Ed.

   [51] A rapacite, from robbery, extortion, plunder mz-hchms, from
   violence, outrage, or injustice done by force or violence: it means
   tyrannical injustice. "Apo tes adikias -- from injustice," wrong,
   iniquity. -- Sept. But as it is said to be in their hand, it means, by
   a metonymy, the plunder got by injustice, exercised tyrannically.
   Marckius observes that the similitude here is first taken from the
   feet, and then taken from the hands. The feet are no to go in the evil
   way, nor the hands employed in doing what is unjust. Henry explains the
   passage very fully and yet concisely, "let them turn every one from his
   evil way -- the evil way of his heart -- and the evil way of his
   conversation; and particularly from the violence that is in their
   hands, -- let them restore what they have unjustly taken, and make
   reparation for the wrong they have done, -- and let them not any more
   oppress those they have power over, or defraud those they have dealings
   with." -- Ed.

   Jonah 3:9

   9. Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his
   fierce anger, that we perish not?

   9. Quis novit an convertatur et poenitentia ducatur Deus, et revertatur
   a furore irae suae, ut non pereamus?


   The mind and design of the king are here more distinctly stated, --
   that he thus endeavored to reconcile himself and the people to God.
   Some give a rendering somewhat different, "He who knows will turn and
   be led by penitence," etc.; they read not interrogatively; but this
   rendering cannot stand. There is in the meaning of the Prophet nothing
   ambiguous, for he introduces the king here as expressing a doubt, Who
   knows whether God will be reconciled to us? We hence see that the king
   was not overwhelmed with despair for he still thought of a remedy; and
   this is the purport of the verse.

   But this may seem contrary to the nature of faith; and then if it be
   opposed to faith, it follows that it must be inconsistent with
   repentance; for faith and repentance are connected together, as we have
   observed in other places; as no one can willingly submit to God, except
   he has previously known his goodness, and entertained a hope of
   salvation; for he who is touched only with fear avoids God's presence;
   and then despair prevails, and perverseness follows. How then was it
   that the king of Nineveh had seriously and undissemblingly repented,
   while yet he spoke doubtfully of the favor of God? To this I answer,
   that it was a measure of doubt, which was yet connected with faith,
   even that which does not directly reject the promise of God, but has
   other hindrances: as for instance, when any ones cast down with fear,
   afterwards receives courage from the hope of pardon and salvation set
   before him, he is not yet immediately freed from all fear; for as long
   as he looks on his sins, and is entangled by various thoughts, he
   vacillates, he fluctuates. There is, therefore, no doubt but that the
   king of Nineveh entertained hope of deliverance; but at the same time
   his mind was perplexed, both on account of the sermon of Jonah and on
   account of the consciousness of his own sins: there were then two
   obstacles, which deprived the king's mind of certainty, or at least
   prevented him from apprehending immediately the mercy of God, and from
   perceiving with a calm mind that God would be gracious to him. The
   first obstacle was the awful message, -- that Nineveh would be
   destroyed in forty days. For though Jonah, as we have said, might have
   added something more, yet the denunciation was distinct and express,
   and tended to cast down the minds of all. The king then had to
   struggle, in order to overcome this obstacle, and to resist this
   declaration of Jonah as far as it was found to be without any comfort.
   And then the king, while considering his own sins, could not but
   vacillate for some time. But yet we see that he strove to emerge,
   though he had these obstacles before his eyes, for he says, Who knows
   whether God will turn from the fury of his wrath, and repent? We hence
   see that the king was in a hard struggle; for though Jonah seemed to
   have closed the door and to shut out the king from any hope of
   deliverance, and though his own conscience held him fast bound, he yet
   perseveres and encourages himself; in short, he aspires to the hope of
   pardon.

   And it must be further noticed, that this form of expression expresses
   a difficulty rather than a mistrust. The king then here asks, as it
   were doubtingly, Who knows whether God will turn? for it was a
   difficult thing to be believed, that God, after a long forbearance,
   would spare the wicked city. Hence the king expresses it as a
   difficulty; and such an interrogation was no proof of the absence of
   faith. A similar expression is found in Joel, "Who knows," etc.? We
   then stated several things in explaining that passage: but it is enough
   here briefly to state, that the king here does not betray a mistrust,
   but sets forth a difficulty. And it was an evidence of humility that he
   acknowledged himself and his people to be sunk as it were, in the
   lowest hell, and yet ceased not to entertain some hope: for it is a
   strong proof of hope, when we still entertain it, though this be
   contrary to the whole order of nature, and wholly inconsistent with
   human reason. We now then see the meaning of the words. Of the
   repentance of God we shall speak hereafter, either to-morrow or the day
   after.

   Lest we perish, he says. We see how a heathen king thought of redeeming
   himself from destruction' it was by having God pacified. As soon then
   as any danger threatens us, let us bear this in mind, that no
   deliverance can be found except the Lord receives us into favor; such
   was the conviction of the king of Nineveh, for he concluded that all
   things would be well as soon as God should be propitious. We hence see
   how much this new and untrained disciple had improved; for he
   understood that men cannot escape miseries until God be pacified
   towards them, and that when men return into favor with him, though they
   ought to have perished a hundred times before, they yet shall be
   delivered and made safe; for the grace or the favor of God is the
   fountain of life and salvation, and of all blessings. It afterwards
   follows --

   Jonah 3:10

   10. And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and
   God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them;
   and he did it not.

   10. Et vidit Deus opera eorum, quod conversi essent a via sua mala; et
   poenituit Deum super malo, quod pronuntiaverat se facturum illis, et
   non fecit.


   Jonah now says, that the Ninevites obtained pardon through their
   repentance: and this is an example worthy of being observed; for we
   hence learn for what purpose God daily urges us to repentance, and that
   is, because he desires to be reconciled to us, and that we should be
   reconciled to him. The reason then why so many reproofs and threatening
   resound in our ears, whenever we come to hear the word of God, is this,
   -- that as God seeks to recover us from destruction he speaks sharply
   to us: in short, whatever the Scripture contains on repentance and the
   judgment of God ought to be wholly applied for this purpose -- to
   induce us to return into favor with him; for he is ready to be
   reconciled, and is ever prepared to embrace those who without
   dissimulation turn to him. We then understand by this example that God
   has no other object in view, whenever he sharply constrains us, than
   that he may be reconciled to us, provided only we be our own judges,
   and thus anticipate his wrath by genuine sorrow of heart, provided we
   solicit the pardon of our guilt and sin, and loathe ourselves, and
   confess that we are worthy of perdition.

   But Jonah seems to ascribe their deliverance to their repentance, and
   also to their works: for he says that the Ninevites obtained pardon,
   because God looked on their works.

   We must first see what works he means, that no one may snatch at a
   single word, as hypocrites are wont to do; and this, as we have said,
   is very commonly the case under the Papacy. God had respect to their
   works -- what works? not sackcloth, not ashes, not fasting; for Jonah
   does not now mention these; but he had respect to their works --
   because they turned from their evil way. We hence see that God was not
   pacified by outward rites only, by the external profession of
   repentance, but that he rather looked on the true and important change
   which had taken place in the Ninevites, for they had become renewed.
   These then were their works, even the fruits of repentance. And such a
   change of life could not have taken place, had not the Ninevites been
   really moved by a sense of God's wrath. The fear of God then had
   preceded; and this fear could not have been without faith. We hence see
   that he chiefly speaks here not of external works, but of the
   renovation of men.

   But if any one objects and says that still this view does not prevent
   us from thinking that good works reconcile us to God, and that they
   thus procure our salvation: to this I answer -- that the question here
   is not about the procuring cause of forgiveness. It is certain that God
   was freely pacified towards the Ninevites, as he freely restores his
   favor daily to us. Jonah then did not mean that satisfactions availed
   before God, as though the Ninevites made compensations for their former
   sins. The words mean no such thing; but he shows it as a fact which
   followed, that God was pacified, because the Ninevites repented. But we
   are to learn from other parts of Scripture how God becomes gracious to
   us, and how we obtain pardon with him, and whether this comes to us for
   our merits and repentance or whether God himself forgives us freely.
   Since the whole Scripture testifies that pardon is gratuitously given
   us, and that God cannot be otherwise propitious to us than by not
   imputing sins, there is no need, with regard to the present passage,
   anxiously to inquire why God looked on the works of the Ninevites, so
   as not to destroy them: for this is said merely as a consequence. Jonah
   then does not here point out the cause, but only declares that God was
   pacified towards the Ninevites, as soon as they repented. But we shall
   speak more on this subject.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as we are loaded with so many vices, and so
   many sins, yea, and scandalous crimes break out daily among us, -- O
   grant, that we may not be hardened against so many exhortations, by
   which thou invites us to thyself, but that being made contrite in
   spirit, whenever thou denounces on us thy wrath, we may be really
   humbled, and so place ourselves before thy tribunal, that we may, by a
   true confession and genuine fear, anticipate the judgment which would
   otherwise have been prepared for us; and that in the meantime relying
   on Christ our Mediator, we may entertain such a hope of pardon as may
   raise us up to thee, and not doubt but that thou art ready to embrace
   us, when we shall be moved by a true and real feeling of fear and
   penitence, since it is a proof of thy favor, when thou art pleased to
   anticipate us, and by thy Spirit testifies that thou art a Father to
   us; and, in a word, may we be so cast down in ourselves, as to raise up
   our hope even to heaven, through Jesus Christ one Lord. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lecture Seventy-ninth

   We stated yesterday how God remitted to the Ninevites the punishment
   which he had threatened by the mouth of Jonah, and that the remission
   both of the punishment and of the guilt was gratuitous. For whenever
   God sets forth pardon to sinners, the condition of repentance is at the
   same time added: it does not yet follow that repentance is the
   procuring cause of obtaining pardon; for God offers it freely, nor is
   he otherwise induced than by his own mere bounty. But as he would not
   have men to abuse his indulgence and forbearance, he lays down this
   condition, -- that they must repent of their former life and change for
   the better. So then he regards the works of those who testify that they
   hate sin, and who, with a sincere and real desire, flee to His mercy;
   and no man from the heart desires God to be propitious to him, but he
   who loathes himself on account of his sin. This is the reason why
   Isaiah also says, that God would be merciful to the remnants of his
   people, even because every one would turn away from his iniquity. God
   does not certainly mean by these words that repentance, as already
   stated, is the cause of our salvation; but he requires a change for the
   better, for no one will really seek grace, except he loathes himself on
   account of his sins.

   Now as to what Jonah adds, that God was led to repent, it is a mode of
   speaking that ought to be sufficiently known to us. Strictly speaking,
   no repentance can belong to God: and it ought not to be ascribed to his
   secret and hidden counsel. God then is in himself ever the same, and
   consistent with himself; but he is said to repent, when a regard is had
   to the comprehension of men: for as we conceive God to be angry,
   whenever he summons us to his tribunal, and shows to us our sins; so
   also we conceive him to be placable, when he offers the hope of pardon.
   But it is according to our perceptions that there is any change, when
   God forgets his wrath, as though he had put on a new character. As then
   we cannot otherwise be terrified, that we may be humbled before God and
   repent, except he sets forth before us his wrath, the Scripture
   accommodates itself to the grossness of our understanding. But, on the
   other hand, we cannot confidently call on God, unless we feel assured
   that he is placable. We hence see that some kind of change appears to
   us, whenever God either threatens or gives hope of pardon and
   reconciliation: and to this must be referred this mode of speaking
   which Jonah adopts, when he says that God repented.

   We hence see that there is a twofold view of God, -- as he sets himself
   forth in his word, -- and as he is as to his hidden counsel. With
   regard to his secret counsel, I have already said that God is always
   like himself, and is subject to none of our feelings: but with regard
   to the teaching of his word, it is accommodated to our capacities. God
   is now angry with us, and then, as though he were pacified, he offers
   pardon, and is propitious to us. Such is the repentance of God.

   Let us then remember that it proceeds from his word, that God is said
   to repent; for the Ninevites could form no other opinion but that it
   was God's decree that they were to be destroyed, -- how so? because he
   had so testified by his word. But when they rose up to an assurance of
   deliverance, they then found that a change had taken place, that is,
   according to the knowledge of their own faith: and the feelings both of
   fear and of joy proceeded from the word: for when God denounced his
   wrath, it was necessary for the wretched men to be terrified; but when
   he invited them to a state of safety by proposing reconciliation to
   them, he then put on a new character; and thus they ascribed a new
   feeling to God. This is the meaning. Let us now proceed --

   Chapter 4.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jonah 4:1

   1. But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.

   1. Et displicuit Jonae dolore magno, et succensuit apud se. [52]


   Jerome commends this grief of Jonah, and compares it to the holy zeal
   of Paul when he wished himself to be an anathema for his brethren,
   (Romans 9:3:) for he denies that he grieved because God had showed
   mercy to so illustrious a city; but because the conversion of the
   Gentiles was a certain presage of the destruction of the chosen people.
   As then Jonah perceived as in a mirror the near ruin of Israel, he on
   this account grieved, if we believe Jerome: but this notion is
   extremely frivolous; for, immediately after, God reproved Jonah. What
   then will the foolish and puerile apology of Jerome avail the Prophet,
   since God has declared that he acted perversely in grieving? Nay, the
   dullness of Jerome is thus become evident; (thus indeed do I speak of a
   man, who, though learned and laborious, has yet deprived himself of
   that praise, which otherwise he might have justly earned.) His wayward
   disposition everywhere betrayed itself; and he is evidently disproved
   in this very context, where Jonah shows clearly that the cause of his
   grief was another, even this, -- that he was unwilling to be deemed a
   false or a lying prophet: hence was his great grief and his bitterness.
   And this we see, had God not expressed his mind, was unjust and
   inconsistent with every reason.

   We may then conclude that Jonah was influenced by false zeal when he
   could not with resignation bear that the city of Nineveh should have
   been delivered from destruction: and he also himself amplifies the
   greatness of his sin. He might have said, in one word, that it
   displeased Jonah; but not satisfied with this simple form, he adds,
   that he felt great displeasure or grief; and he afterwards adds, that
   he was very angry. Though the beginning may not have been wrong, yet
   excess was sinful. But he confesses that there was excess, and want of
   moderation in his grief: since then he accuses himself in plain words
   what good is it, by false and invented pretenses, to cover what we
   clearly see cannot be excused? But that it may be more evident why the
   deliverance of the city of Nineveh displeased Jonah, let us go on with
   the context --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [52] The two verbs used here are evidently to be construed as
   impersonals. The most literal rendering would be thus, -- "And it was
   an evil to Jonah, a great evil;
   and wrath was to him," or, "he was wroth." Evil means often grief or
   distress, and so it is here: but the verb chrh, properly rendered in
   our version, "very angry," seldom if ever, means grief. It is sometimes
   rendered "grieved" in our version; but in every instance that I can
   find, it means the grief of anger or displeasure. It occurs twice in
   Genesis 4, in exactly similar form as we find it here, followed by the
   preposition l, vychr lqyn m'd, "and Cain was very wroth," or literally,
   "and there was wrath to Cain very much," version 5. And then in the
   following verse we have the like form, lmh chrh ld, "Why are thou
   wroth?" or, "Why is wrath to thee?" The phrase here is, lv vychr, "and
   wrath was to him." What seems to have made some commentators to change
   wrath or anger to grief, as has been a desire to screen the guilt of
   Jonah. But the whole narrative clearly shows that he was so displeased
   as to be angry. His pettish request to die is a sufficient proof of
   this. Calvin was not a man to trifle with the word of God for this
   purpose, or for any other: nor was he at a loss to account for the sin
   of Jonah, without denying his piety. It is only shallow Christians, and
   such as have only the outward shell of religion, who are reduced to
   this dilemma. Marckius very justly observes, "That though all the works
   of God are altogether blameless (irreprehensibilia,) yet there is
   hardly anything which is not sometimes blamed by our most foolish flesh
   (carne insipientissima.) Thus not only the world, God's enemy, sins
   against him; but even his own people, who honor him, openly show, one
   while, that his severity, and at another time that his kindness,
   displease them, as though they were not befitting." -- Ed.

   Jonah 4:2

   2. And he prayed unto the Lord, and said, I pray thee, O Lord, was not
   this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before
   unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful,
   slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.

   2. Et oravit ad Jehovam et dixit, Obsecro Jehova, an non hic sermo
   meus, quum adhuc essem in terra mea? Propterea festinavi fugere in
   Tharsis, quia noveram quod tu sis Deus propitius (vel, plenus gratiae,)
   et misericors, tardus ad iram, multus clementia, et qui poenitentia
   duceris super malo.


   It seems by no means befitting that Jonah should have said here that he
   prayed; for prayer ought to be calm; but he confesses that his mind was
   in a state of excitement. As then anger was burning within the Prophet,
   how could he come before God and utter a suitable prayer? And further,
   what is the end of praying, but to confess that whatever good is to be
   obtained resides in God, and is to be sought humbly from him? But Jonah
   here, on the contrary, expostulates and clamors against God; for he
   seems in a manner to be contending that he had a just reason for his
   flight, and also that God ought not to have pardoned the Ninevites. He
   then accuses God, that he might free himself from every blame. But all
   this is foreign and remote from what is required in prayer. How then
   must we understand this passage, in which he says that he prayed? My
   answer is -- that the faithful often in a disturbed state of mind
   approach God with a desire to pray, and that their prayers are not
   wholly rejected, though they are not altogether approved and accepted.
   And hence also it appears more evident how the works of the godly are
   regarded by God, though they are sprinkled with many stains. Whenever
   the Papists read that any work has pleased God, they imagine that all
   was perfection and cleanness: but there is no work which is not
   infected with some pollution, unless it be purified by a free pardon.
   This I say is evident to us in this prayer, which was not so rejected
   by God, as though it retained not the character of prayer: and yet it
   is certain that Jonah was by no means rightly influenced when he prayed
   so clamorously, finding fault, as it were, with God, and retaining
   still some portion of his own obstinacy; for he boasted of his flight.
   But this flight, as we have stated, was a proof of manifest rebellion,
   since, by shaking off the yoke, he despised the call of God.

   We must therefore acknowledge that there was some piety in this prayer
   of Jonah, as well as many faults. It was an act of piety that he
   addressed his complaints to God. For though hypocrites may pray to God,
   they yet are wholly averse to him, and freely give vent to their
   bitterness against God: but Jonah, while he here complains, and
   observes no moderation, but is carried away by a blind and perverse
   impulse, is yet prepared to submit to God, as we shall hereafter see.
   This is the reason why he says that he prayed: for he would not have
   been ashamed to confess any grievous sin of which he might have been
   conscious. He did not then extenuate his fault by using the word prayer
   as hypocrites are wont to do, who ever set up some pretenses or veils
   when they seek to cover their own baseness: such was not the object of
   Jonah. When therefore he says that he prayed, he declares generally
   that he did not so speak against God, but that he still retained some
   seed of piety and obedience in his heart. Jonah then prayed. Hence it
   follows, as I have before stated, that many of the prayers of the
   saints are sinful, (vitiosas -- faulty) which, when tried by the right
   rule, deserve to be rejected. But the Lord, according to his own mercy,
   pardons their defects so that these confused and turbulent prayers yet
   retain their title and honor.

   Now he says, I pray thee, Jehovah is not this what I said? Here Jonah
   openly declares why he bore so ill the deliverance of Nineveh from
   destruction, because he was thus found to have been false and lying.
   But it may seem strange that the Prophet had more regard for his own
   reputation than for the glory of God; for in this especially shines
   forth the glory of God, that he is reconcilable as soon as men return
   to the right way, and that he offers himself to them as a father. Ought
   then Jonah to have preferred his own honor to the glory of God? I
   answer, -- that the Prophet was not so devoted to himself, but that a
   concern for the glory of God held the first place in his soul; this is
   certain. For he connected, and justly so, his own ministry with the
   glory of God; as it proceeded from his authority. When Jonah entered
   Nineveh, he cried not as a private man, but avowed that he was sent by
   God. Now if the preaching of Jonah is found to be false, reproach will
   recoil on the author of his call, even on God. Jonah then no doubt
   could not bear that the name of God should be exposed to the reproaches
   of the Gentiles, as though he had spoken dissemblingly, now opening
   hell, then heaven: and there is nothing so contrary to the glory of God
   as such a dissimulation. We hence see why Jonah was seized with so much
   grief; he did not regard himself; but as he saw that an occasion would
   be given to ungodly blasphemers, if God changed his purpose, or if he
   did not appear consistent with his word, he felt much grieved.

   But however specious this reason may be, we yet learn of how much avail
   are good intentions with God. Whatever good intention can be imagined,
   it was certainly a good intention in Jonah, worthy of some praise, that
   he preferred dying a hundred times rather than to hear these
   reproachful blasphemies -- that the word of God was a mere sport, that
   his threatening were no better than fables, that God made this and that
   pretense, and transformed himself into various characters. This was
   certainly the very best intention, if it be estimated by our judgment.
   But we shall presently see that it was condemned by the mouth of God
   himself. Let us hence learn not to arrogate to ourselves judgment in
   matters which exceed our capacities, but to subject our minds to God,
   and to seek of him the spirit of wisdom. For whence was it that Jonah
   so fretted against God, except that he burned with a desire for his
   glory? But his zeal was inconsiderate, for he would be himself the
   judge and arbitrator, while, on the contrary, he ought to have
   subjected himself altogether to God. And the same rule ought to be
   observed also by us. When we see many things happening through a Divine
   interposition, that is, through the secret providence of God, and
   things which expose his name to the blasphemies of the ungodly, we
   ought indeed to feel grief; but in the meantime let us ask of the Lord
   to turn at length these shameful reproaches to his own glory; and let
   us by no means raise an uproar, as many do, who immediately begin to
   contend with God, when things are otherwise ordered than what they wish
   or think to be useful. Let us learn by the example of Jonah not to
   measure God's judgments by our own wisdom, but to wait until he turns
   darkness into light. And at the same time let us learn to obey his
   commands, to follow his call without any disputing: though heaven and
   earth oppose us, though many things occur which may tend to avert us
   from the right course, let us yet continue in this resolution, -- that
   nothing is better for us than to obey God, and to go on in the way
   which he points out to us.

   But by saying that he hastened to go to Tarshish, he does not
   altogether excuse his flight; but he now more clearly explains, that he
   did not shun trouble or labor, that he did not run away from a contest
   or danger, but that he only avoided his call, because he felt a concern
   for the glory of God. The import, then, of Jonah's words is, -- that he
   makes God here, as it were, his witness and judge, that he did not
   withdraw himself from obedience to God through fear of danger, or
   through idleness, or through a rebellious spirit, or through any other
   evil motive, but only because he was unwilling that his holy name
   should be profaned, and would not of his own accord be the minister of
   that preaching, which would be the occasion of opening the mouth of
   ungodly and profane men, and of making them to laugh at God himself.
   Since then I cannot hope, he says, for any other issue to my preaching
   than to make the Gentiles to deride God, yea, and to revile his holy
   name, as though he were false and deceitful, I chose rather to flee to
   Tarshish. Then Jonah does not here altogether clear himself; for
   otherwise that chastisement, by which he ought to have been thoroughly
   subdued, must have failed in its effect. He had been lately restored
   from the deep, and shall we say that he now so extols himself against
   God, that he wishes to appear wholly free from every blame? This
   certainly would be very strange: but, as I have said, he declares to
   God, that he fled at the beginning for no other reason, but because he
   did not expect any good fruit from his preaching, but, on the contrary,
   feared what now seemed to take place, -- that God's name would be
   ridiculed.

   For he immediately adds, For I know that thou art a God full of grace,
   and merciful, slow to wrath, etc. It is a wonder that Jonah withdrew
   from his lawful call; for he knew that God was merciful, and there is
   no stronger stimulant than this to stir us on, when God is pleased to
   use our labor: and we know that no one can with alacrity render service
   to God except he be allured by his paternal kindness. Hence no one will
   be a willing Prophet or Teacher, except he is persuaded that God is
   merciful. Jonah then seems here to reason very absurdly when he says,
   that he withdrew himself from his office, because he knew that God was
   merciful. But how did he know this? By the law of God; for the passage
   is taken from Exodus 33:1, where is described that remarkable and
   memorable vision, in which God offered to Moses a view of himself: and
   there was then exhibited to the holy Prophet, as it were, a living
   representation of God, and there is no passage in the law which
   expresses God's nature more to the life; for God was then pleased to
   make himself known in a familiar way to his servant.

   As then Jonah had been instructed in the doctrine of the law, how could
   he discharge the office of a Prophet among his own people? And why did
   not this knowledge discourage his mind, when he was called to the
   office of a Teacher? It is then certain that this ought to be confined
   to the sort of preaching, such as we have before explained. Jonah would
   not have shrunk from God's command, had he been sent to the Ninevites
   to teach what he had been ordered to do among the chosen people. Had
   then a message been committed to Jonah, to set forth a gracious and
   merciful God to the Ninevites, he would not have hesitated a moment to
   offer his service. But as this express threatening, Nineveh shall be
   destroyed, was given him in charge, he became confounded, and sought at
   length to flee away rather than to execute such a command. Why so?
   Because he thus reasoned with himself, "I am to denounce a near ruin on
   the Ninevites; why does God command me to do this, except to invite
   these wretched men to repentance? Now if they repent, will not God be
   instantly ready to forgive them? He would otherwise deny his own
   nature: God cannot be unlike himself, he cannot put off that
   disposition of which he has once testified to Moses. Since God, then,
   is reconcilable, if the Ninevites will return to the right way and flee
   to him, he will instantly embrace them: thus I shall be found to be
   false in my preaching."

   We now then perceive how this passage of Jonah is to be understood,
   when he says that he fled beyond the sea, at least that he attempted to
   do so, because he knew that God was gracious; for he would not have
   deprived God of his service, had not this contrariety disturbed and
   discouraged his mind, "What! I shall go there as God's ambassador, in a
   short time I shall be discovered to be a liar: will not this reproach
   be cast on the name of God himself? It is therefore better for me to be
   silent, than that God, the founder of my call, should be ridiculed." We
   see that Jonah had a distinct regard to that sort of preaching which we
   have already referred to. And it hence appears that Jonah gave to the
   Ninevites more than he thought; for he supposed that he was sent by
   God, only that the Ninevites might know that they were to be destroyed:
   but he brought deliverance to them; and this indeed he partly suspected
   or knew before; for he retained this truth -- that God cannot divest
   himself of his mercy, for he remains ever the same. But when he went
   forth to execute the duty enjoined on him he certainly had nothing to
   expect but the entire ruin of the city Nineveh. God in the meantime
   employed his ministry for a better end and purpose. There is indeed no
   doubt but that he exhorted the Ninevites to repentance; but his own
   heart was as it were closed up, so that he could not allow them the
   mercy of God. We hence see that Jonah was seized with perplexities, so
   that he could not offer deliverance to the Ninevites, and it was yet
   offered them by God through his instrumentality.

   We now then understand how God often works by his servants; for he
   leads them as the blind by his own hand where they think not. Thus,
   when he stirs up any one of us, we are sometimes oligopistoi -- very
   weak in faith; we think that our labor will be useless and without any
   fruit, or at least attended with small success. But the Lord will let
   us see what we could not have expected. Such was the case with Jonah;
   for when he came to Nineveh, he had no other object but to testify
   respecting the destruction of the city; but the Lord was pleased to
   make him the minister of salvation. God then honored with remarkable
   success the teaching of Jonah, while he was unworthy of so great an
   honor; for, as we have already said, he closed up in a manner every
   access to the blessing of God. We now then apprehend the meaning of
   this passage, in which Jonah says that he fled from the call of God,
   because he knew that God was ready to be gracious and merciful.

   I come now to the great things which are said of God. chnvn, chenun,
   properly means a disposition to show favor, as though it was said that
   God is gratuitously benevolent; we express the same in our language by
   the terms, benin, gratieux, debonnaire. God then assumes to himself
   this character; and then he says, merciful; and he adds this that we
   may know that he is always ready to receive us, if indeed we come to
   him as to the fountain of goodness and mercy. But the words which
   follow express more clearly his mercy, and show how God is merciful, --
   even because he is abundant in compassion and slow to wrath. God then
   is inclined to kindness; and though men on whom he looks are unworthy,
   he is yet merciful; and this he expresses by the word rchvm, rechum

   It is at the same time necessary to add these two sentences that he is
   abundant in compassion and slow to wrath, -- why so? For we ever seek
   in ourselves some cause for God's favor; when we desire God to be kind
   to us, we inquire in ourselves why he ought to favor us: and when we
   find nothing, all the faith we before had respecting God's grace at
   once vanishes. The Lord therefore does here recall us to himself, and
   testifies that he is kind and merciful, inasmuch as he is abundant in
   compassion; as though he said, "I have in myself a sufficient reason,
   why I should be accessible to you, and why I should receive you and
   show you favor." Hence the goodness of God alone ought to be regarded
   by us, when we desire his mercy, and when we have need of pardon. It is
   as though he had said, that he is not influenced by any regard for our
   worthiness, and that it is not for merits that he is disposed to mercy
   when we have sinned, and that he receives us into favor; but that he
   does all this because his goodness is infinite and inexhaustible. And
   it is also added, that he is slow to wrath This slowness to wrath
   proves that God provides for the salvation of mankind, even when he is
   provoked by their sins. Though miserable men provoke God daily against
   themselves, he yet continues to have a regard for their salvation. He
   is therefore slow to wrath, which means, that the Lord does not
   immediately execute such punishment as they deserve who thus provoke
   him. We now then see what is the import of these words.

   Let us now return to this -- that Jonah thrust himself from his office,
   because he knew that God was slow to wrath, and merciful, and full of
   grace: he even had recourse to this reasoning, "Either God will change
   his nature, or spare the Ninevites if they repent: and it may be that
   they will repent; and then my preaching will be found to be false; for
   God will not deny himself, but will afford an example of his goodness
   and mercy in forgiving this people." We may again remark, that we act
   perversely, when we follow without discrimination our own zeal: it is
   indeed a blind fervor which then hurries us on. Though then a thousand
   inconsistencies meet us when God commands any thing, our eyes ought to
   be closed to them, and we ought ever to follow the course of our
   calling; for he will so regulate all events, that all things shall
   redound to his glory. It is not for us in such a case to be over-wise;
   but the best way is, to leave in God's hand the issue of things. It
   becomes us indeed to fear and to feel concerned; but our anxiety ought,
   at the same time, to be in submission to God, so that it is enough for
   us to pray. This is the import of the whole.

   Now as to what he says that God repents of the evil, we have already
   explained this: it means, that though God has already raised his hand,
   he will yet withdraw it, as soon as he sees any repentance in men; for
   evil here is to be taken for punishment. The Lord then, though he might
   justly inflict extreme punishment on men, yet suspends his judgment,
   and when they come to him in true penitence he is instantly pacified.
   This is God's repentance; he is said to repent when he freely forgives
   whatever punishment or evil men have deserved whenever they loathe
   themselves. [53] It now follows --

   Jonah 4:3

   3. Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it
   is better for me to die than to live.

   3. Et tu Jehova, tolle, quaeso, animam meam a me; quia melius mori meum
   quam vivere.


   We here see how angry Jonah was in his zeal: for this prayer cannot
   certainly be ascribed to his faith, as some think, who say that Jonah
   took a flight as it were in his soul to heaven, when he made this
   prayer, as though he dreaded not death, but having been divested of all
   fear, being free and disengaged, he presented himself to God. I do not
   think that the mind of Jonah was so heroic. There is indeed no doubt,
   as I have already said, but that he still retained some seed of piety;
   and this, I said, is sufficiently proved by the word prayer; for if
   Jonah had burst out in the strain of one in despair, it would not have
   been a prayer. Since then he prayed by thus speaking, it follows that
   it was not the cry of despair, but of too much displeasure, which Jonah
   did not restrain. In short, this prayer proceeded from a pious and holy
   zeal; but Jonah sinned as to its measure or excess; for he had in a
   manner forgotten himself, when he preferred death to life

   Thou Jehovah, he says, take me away. He was first not free from blame
   in hastily wishing to die; for it is not in our power to quit this
   world; but we ought with submissive minds to continue in it as long as
   God keeps us in the station in which we are placed. whosoever, then,
   hastens to death with so great an ardor no doubt offends God. Paul knew
   that death was desirable in his case, (Philippians 1:22;) but when he
   understood that his labor would be useful to the Church, he was
   contented with his lot, and preferred the will of God to his own will;
   and thus he was prepared both to live and to die, as it seemed good to
   God. It was otherwise with Jonah, "Now," he says, "take away my life."
   This was one fault; but the other was, -- that he wished to die,
   because God spared the Ninevites. Though he was touched with some
   grief, he ought not yet to have gone so far as this, or rather to rush
   on, so as to desire death on account of the weariness of his life.

   But we hence learn to what extremes men are carried, when once they
   give loose reins to inconsiderate zeal. The holy Prophet Jonah, who had
   been lately tamed and subdued by so heavy a chastisements is now seized
   and carried away by a desire to die, -- and why? because he thought
   that it was hard that he denounced destruction on the Ninevites, and
   that still their city remained safe. This example ought to check us,
   that we express not too boldly our opinion respecting the doings of
   God, but, on the contrary, hold our thoughts captive, lest any
   presumption of this kind be manifested by us; for there is none of us
   who does not condemn Jonah, as also he condemned himself; for he does
   not here narrate his own praise, but means to show how foolishly he had
   judged of God's work. Jonah then confesses his own folly; and therefore
   his experience is to us an evidence that there is nothing more
   preposterous than for us to settle this or that according to our own
   wisdom, since this is alone true wisdom, to submit ourselves wholly to
   the will of God.

   Now if any one raises a question here, -- whether it is lawful to
   desire death; the answer may be briefly this, -- that death is not to
   be desired on account of the weariness of life; this is one thing: and
   by the weariness of life I understand that state of mind, when either
   poverty, or want, or disgrace, or any such thing, renders life hateful
   to us: but if any, through weariness on account of his sins and hatred
   to them, regrets his delay on earth, and can adopt the language of
   Paul,

   "Miserable am I, who will free me from the body of this death!" (Romans
   7:24,)

   -- he entertains a holy and pious wish, provided the submission, to
   which I have referred, be added so that this feeling may not break
   forth in opposition to the will of God; but that he who has such a
   desire may still suffer himself to be detained by his hand as long as
   he pleases. And further, when any one wishes to die, because he fears
   for himself as to the future, or dreads to undergo any evil, he also
   struggles against God; and such was the fault of Jonah; for he says
   that death was better to him than life, -- and why? because the Lord
   had spared the Ninevites. We hence see how he was blinded, yea, carried
   away by a mad impulse to desire death.

   Let us then learn so to love this life as to be prepared to lay it down
   whenever the Lord pleases: let us also learn to desire death, but so as
   to live to the Lord, and to proceed in the race set before use until he
   himself lead us to its end. Now follows the reproof of God --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jonah 4:4

   4. Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?

   4. Et dixit Jehova, An bene facis excandescendo apud te? [54]


   There is no doubt but that God by thus reproving Jonah condemns his
   intemperate warmth. But since God alone is a fit judge of man's
   conduct, there is no reason for us to boast that we are influenced by
   good intentions; for there is nothing more fallacious than our own
   balances. When therefore we weigh facts, deeds, and thoughts by our own
   judgment, we deceive ourselves. Were any disposed rhetorically to
   defend the conduct of Jonah, he might certainly muster up many specious
   pretenses; and were any one inclined to adduce excuses for Jonah, he
   might be made to appear to us altogether innocent: but though the whole
   world absolved him, what would it avail, since he was condemned by the
   mouth of God himself, who alone, as I have already stated, is the
   judge? We ought then to feel assured, that Jonah had done foolishly,
   even if no reason was apparent to us; for the authority of the Supreme
   Judge ought to be more than sufficient.

   Now God expressly condemns his wrath. Had Jonah modestly expostulated,
   and unburdened his griefs into the bosom of God, it would have been
   excusable; though his ardor would not have been free from blame, it
   might yet have been borne with. But now, when he is angry, it is past
   endurance; for wrath, as one says, is but short madness; and then it
   blinds the perceptions of men, it disturbs all the faculties of the
   soul. God then does not here in a slight manner condemn Jonah, but he
   shows how grievously he had fallen by allowing himself to become thus
   angry. We must at the same time remember, that Jonah had sinned not
   only by giving way to anger; he might have sinned, as we have said,
   without being angry. But God by this circumstance -- that he thus
   became turbulent, enhances his sin. And it is certainly a most unseemly
   thing, when a mean creature rises up against God, and in a boisterous
   spirit contends with him: this is monstrous; and Jonah was in this
   state of mind.

   We hence see why an express mention is made of his anger, -- God thus
   intended to bring conviction home to Jonah, that he might no more seek
   evasions. Had he simply said, "Why! how is it that thou dost not leave
   to me the supreme right of judging? If such is my will, why dost not
   thou submissively acknowledge that what I do is rightly done? Is it thy
   privilege to be so wise, as to dictate laws to me, or to correct my
   decisions?" -- had the Lord thus spoken, there might have remained
   still some excuse; Jonah might have said, "Lord, I cannot restrain my
   grief, when I see thy name so profaned by unseemly reproaches; can I
   witness this with a calm mind?" He might thus have still sought some
   coverings for his grief; but when the Lord brought forward his anger,
   he must have been necessarily silenced; for what could be found to
   excuse Jonah, when he thus perversely rebelled, as I have said, against
   God, his Judge and Maker? We now then understand why God expressly
   declares that Jonah did not do well in being thus angry.

   But I wonder how it came into Jerome's mind to say that Jonah is not
   here reproved by the Lord, but that something of an indifferent kind is
   mentioned. He was indeed a person who was by nature a sophister,
   (cavillator -- a caviler;) and thus he wantonly trifled with the work
   of falsifying Scripture; he made no conscience of perverting passages
   of holy writ. As, for instance, when he writes about marriage, he says
   that they do not ill who marry, and yet that they do not well. What a
   sophistry is this, and how vapid! So also on this place, "God," he
   says, "does not condemn Jonah, neither did he intend to reprove his
   sin; but, on the contrary, Jonah brings before us here the person of
   Christ, who sought death that the whole world might be saved; for when
   alive he could not do good to his own nation, he could not save his own
   kindred; he therefore preferred to devote himself and his life for the
   redemption of the world." These are mere puerilities; and thus the
   whole meaning of this passage, as we clearly see, is distorted. But the
   question is more emphatical than if God had simply said, "Thou hast
   sinned by being thus angry;" for an affirmative sentence has not so
   much force as that which is in the form of a question.

   God then not only declares as a Judge that Jonah had not done well, but
   he also draws from him his own confession, as though he said, "Though
   thou art a judge in thine own cause, thou can't not yet make a cover
   for thy passion, for thou art beyond measure angry." For when he says
   lk, lak, with, or, in thyself, he reminds Jonah to examine his own
   heart, as though he said, "Look on thyself as in a mirror: thou wilt
   see what a boisterous sea is thy soul, being seized as thou art by so
   mad a rage." We now then perceive not only the plain sense of the
   passage, but also the emphasis, which is contained in the questions
   which Jerome has turned to a meaning wholly contrary. I will not
   proceed farther; [55] for what remains will be sufficient for
   to-morrow's lecture.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [54] This clause has been variously rendered. The original words are
   these, hhytv chrh lk. It is not to the point to say, as Dr. Henderson
   does, that the first word is sometimes rendered adverbially, as meaning
   "greatly," etc.; for in other places it is rendered as a verb, "to be
   good," or "to do good." It depends wholly on the form of the sentence
   what rendering is the most suitable. Both the construction of the words
   and the connection of the passage seem to favor the literal rendering.
   The first h is the an of the Latin, whether, it is an interrogation.
   Then the rendering is, "Whether it is good," or, "Is that good?" Jonah
   had said before that it was "good" for him to die rather than to live;
   for it is the same word in a different form -- ky tvv mvty mchyy, "for
   good my death rather than my life." Then the question to him is, "Is it
   good that thou art wrathful," or literally, "that wrath is to thee?"
   the verb chrh, as in the first verse, is to be construed impersonally.
   The rendering, "Art thou much vexed?" is pointless and vapid. It is
   indeed countenanced by the Septuagint; but we must remember that on
   some points there is a wrong leaning in that version, and this is one
   of those points. As in the case of Jerome and the early Fathers, there
   was a disposition and an attempt to lessen and even to obliterate all
   the faults and defects of the ancient saints, so it was evidently with
   the authors of this version. Superstition and Pharisaism must have all
   their saints perfect, while the word of God represents all true saints
   as imperfect in the present state, but aiming at, and longing for,
   perfection, and fully expecting to enjoy it hereafter. The version of
   Newcome is, "Doest thou well that thine anger is kindled?" Kindling or
   heat, that is, of anger or wrath, is the ideal meaning of the verb.
   Junius and Tremelius, as well as Dathius, consider that anger, and not
   grief is meant. Dr. Adam Clarke's version is this, "Is anger good for
   thee?" which is certainly very literal; or, as the verb is in the
   causative mood, it might be rendered, "Can anger do good to thee?" It
   may be doubted whether here, and in the ninth verse, where the same
   phrase twice occurs, this rendering is the most obvious and natural. --

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou sees us implicated in so many errors,
   that we often fall through want of thought, and as thou also sees that
   the violent emotions of our flesh wholly blind whatever reason and
   judgment there is in us, -- O grant, that we may learn to give up
   ourselves altogether to obey thee, and so honor thy wisdom as never to
   contend with thee, though all things may happen contrary to our wishes,
   but patiently to wait for such an issue as it may please thee to grant;
   and may we never be disturbed by any of the hindrances which Satan may
   throw in our way, but ever go on towards the mark which thou hast set
   before us, and never turn aside from thee, until, having gone through
   all dangers and overcome all impediments, we shall at length reach that
   blessed rest, which has been obtained for us by the blood of thy Son.
   Amen.

   Jonah 4:5

   5. So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city,
   and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he
   might see what would become of the city.

   5. Et egressus est Jonas ex urbe, et sedit ab oriente contra urbem, et
   fecit sibi illic tabernaculum, et sedit sub eo in umbra, quousque
   videret quid fieret in urbe.


   It may be here doubted whether Jonah had waited till the forty days had
   passed, and whether that time had arrived; for if we say that he went
   out of the city before the fortieth day, another question arises, how
   could he have known what would be? for we have not yet found that he
   had been informed by any oracular communication. But the words which we
   have noticed intimate that it was then known by the event itself, that
   God had spared the city from destruction; for in the last lecture it
   was said, that God had repented of the evil he had declared and had not
   done it. It hence appears that Jonah had not gone out of the city until
   the forty days had passed. But there comes again another question, what
   need had he to sit near the city, for it was evident enough that the
   purpose of God had changed, or at least that the sentence Jonah had
   pronounced was changed? he ought not then to have seated himself near
   the city as though he was doubtful.

   But I am inclined to adopt the conjecture, that Jonah went out after
   the fortieth day, for the words seem to countenance it. With regard to
   the question, why he yet doubted the event, when time seemed to have
   proved it, the answer may be readily given: though indeed the forty
   days had passed, yet Jonah stood as it were perplexed, because he could
   not as yet feel assured that what he had before proclaimed according to
   God's command would be without its effect. I therefore doubt not but
   that Jonah was held perplexed by this thought, "Thou hast declared
   nothing rashly; how can it then be, that what God wished to be
   proclaimed by his own command and in his own name, should be now in
   vain, with no corresponding effect?" Since then Jonah had respect to
   God's command, he could not immediately extricate himself from his
   doubts. This then was the cause why he sat waiting: it was, because he
   thought that though God's vengeance was suspended, his preaching would
   not yet be in vain, but that the ruin of the city was at hand. This
   therefore was the reason why he still waited after the prefixed time,
   as though the event was still doubtful.

   Now that this may be more evident, let us bear in mind that the purpose
   of God was hidden, so that Jonah understood not all the parts of his
   vocation. God, then, when he threatened ruin to the Ninevites, designed
   to speak conditionally: for what could have been the benefit of the
   word, unless this condition was added, -- that the Ninevites, if they
   repented, should be saved? There would otherwise have been no need of a
   Prophet; the Lord might have executed the judgment which the Ninevites
   deserved, had he not intended to regard their salvation. If any one
   objects by saying that a preacher was sent to render them inexcusable,
   -- this would have been unusual; for God had executed all his other
   judgments without any previous denunciation, I mean, with regard to
   heathen nations: it was the peculiar privilege of the Church that the
   Prophets ever denounced the punishments which were at hand; but to
   other nations God made it known that he was their Judge, though he did
   not send Prophets to warn them. There was then included a condition,
   with regard to God's purpose, when he commanded the Ninevites to be
   terrified by so express a declaration. But Jonah was, so to speak, too
   literal a teacher; for he did not include what he ought to have done,
   -- that there was room for repentance, and that the city would be
   saved, if the Ninevites repented of their wickedness. Since then Jonah
   had learned only one half of his office, it is no wonder that his mind
   was still in doubt, and could not feel assured as to the issue; for he
   had nothing but the event, God had not yet made known to him what he
   would do. Let us now proceed --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jonah 4:6-8

   6. And the Lord God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over
   Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his
   grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.

   6. Et paravit Jehova Deus cucurbitam (vel, hederam,) et ascendere fecit
   ad Jonam, ut esset umbra super caput ejus, atque liberaret eum a
   molestia sua; et gavisus est Jonas super hedera (vel, cucurbita) gaudio
   magno.

   7. But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it
   smote the gourd that it withered.

   7. Et paravit Deus vermem quum ascenderet aurora postridie, qui
   percussit hederam et exaruit.

   8. And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a
   vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he
   fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to
   die than to live.

   8. Et accidit, quum exoriretur sol, ut pararet Deus ventum impetuosum
   (qui obsurdescere facit homines; chrs significat obsurdescere; alii
   vertunt, ventum arationis, quia verbum illud etiam significat arare; et
   intelligunt, ventum siccum et frigidum, qualis grassari solet arationis
   tempore,) et percussit sol super caput Jonae, et defecit; et optavit
   pro anima sua, ut moreretur; et dixit, Melior mors mea quam vita.


   Before I proceed to treat on the contents of these verses, I will say a
   few things on the word qyqyvn, kikiun; for there were formerly some
   disputes respecting this word. Some render it, a gourd; (eucurbitam)
   others think it to have been a cucumber. Free conjectures are commonly
   made respecting obscure and unknown things. However, the first
   rendering has been the received one: and Augustine says, that a tumult
   arose in some church, when the Bishop rend the new interpretation of
   Jerome, who said that it was the ivy. Those men were certainly
   thoughtless and foolish who were so offended for a matter so trifling;
   for they ought to have more carefully inquired which version was the
   best and most correct. And Augustine did not act so very wisely in this
   affair; for superstition so possessed him, that he was unwilling that
   the received version of the Old Testament should be changed. He indeed
   willingly allowed Jerome to translate the New Testament from the Greek
   original; but he would not have the Old Testament to be touched; for he
   entertained a suspicion of the Jews, -- that as they were the most
   inveterate enemies of the faith, they would have tried to falsify the
   Law and the Prophets. As then Augustine had this suspicion, he
   preferred retaining the common version. And Jerome relates that he was
   traduced at Rome, because he had rendered it ivy instead of gourd; but
   he answered Augustine in a very severe and almost an angry manner; and
   he inveighed in high displeasure against some Cornelius and another by
   the name of Asinius Polio, who had accused him at Rome as one guilty of
   sacrilege, because he had changed this word. I cannot allege in excuse,
   that they peevishly rejected what was probable. But as to the thing
   itself, I would rather retain in this place the word gourd, or
   cucumber, than to cause any disturbance by a thing of no moment. Jerome
   himself confesses, that it was not ivy; for he says, that it was a kind
   of a shrub, and that it grows everywhere in Syria; he says that it was
   a shrub supported by its own stem, which is not the case with ivy; for
   the ivy, except it cleaves to a wall or to a tree, creeps on the
   ground. It could not then have been the ivy; and he ought not to have
   so translated it. He excuses himself and says, that if he had put down
   the Hebrew word, many would have dreamt it to have been a beast or a
   serpent. He therefore wished to put down something that was known. But
   he might also have caused many doubts: "Why! ivy is said to have
   ascended over the head of Jonah, and to have afforded him a shade; how
   could this have been?" Now I wonder why Jerome says in one place that
   the shrub was called in his time Cicion in the Syrian language; and he
   says in another place in his Commentaries, that it was called in the
   same language Elkeroa; which we see to be wholly different from the
   word qyqyvn, kikiun. Now when he answered Augustine I doubt not but
   that he dissembled; for he knew that Augustine did not understand
   Hebrew: he therefore trifled with him as with a child, because he was
   ignorant. It seems to have been a new gloss, I know not what, invented
   at the time for his own convenience: I doubt not but that he at the
   moment formed the word, as there is some affinity between qyqyvn,
   kikiun, and cicion. However it may have been, whether it was a gourd or
   a shrub, it is not necessary to dispute much how it could have grown so
   soon into so great a size. Jerome says, that it was a shrub with many
   leaves, and that it grew to the size of a vine. Be it so; but this
   shrub grows not in one day, nor in two, nor in three days.

   It must have therefore been something extraordinary. Neither the ivy,
   nor the gourd, nor any shrub, nor any tree, could have grown so quickly
   as to afford a cover to the head of Jonah: nor did this shrub alone
   give shelter to Jonah's head; for it is more probable, that it was
   derived also from the booth which he had made for himself. Jonah then
   not only sheltered himself under the shrub, but had the booth as an
   additional cover, when he was not sufficiently defended from the heat
   of the sun. Hence God added this shrub to the shade afforded by the
   booth: for in those regions, as we know, the sun is very hot; and
   further, it was, as we shall see, an extraordinary heat.

   I wished to say thus much of the word ivy; and I have spoken more than
   I intended; but as there have been contentions formerly on the subject,
   I wished to notice what may be satisfactory even to curious readers. I
   come now to what is contained in this passage.

   Jonah tells us that a gourds or a cucumber, or an ivy, was prepared by
   the Lord. There is no doubt but that this shrub grew in a manner
   unusual, that it might be a cover to the booth of Jonah. So I view the
   passage. But God, we know, approaches nature, whenever he does anything
   beyond what nature is: this is not indeed always the case; but we
   generally find that God so works, as that he exceeds the course of
   nature, and yet from nature he does not wholly depart. For when in the
   desert he intended to collect together a great quantity of quails, that
   he might give meat to the people, he raised wind from the east,
   (Numbers 11:31.) How often the winds blew without bringing such an
   abundance of birds? It was therefore a miracle: but yet God did not
   wholly cast aside the assistance of nature; hence he made use of the
   wind; and yet the wind could not of itself bring these birds. So also
   in this place, God had chosen, I have no doubt, a herb, which soon
   ascended to a great height, and yet far surpassed the usual course of
   nature. In this sense, then, it is that God is said to have prepared
   the qyqyvn, kikiun, [56] and to have made it to ascend over Jonah's
   head, that it might be for a shade to his head and free him from his
   distress.

   But it is said afterwards that a worm was prepared. We see here also,
   that what seemed to happen by chance was yet directed by the hidden
   providence of God. Should any one say, that what is here narrated does
   not commonly happen, but what once happened; to this I answer, -- that
   though God then designed to exhibit a wonderful example, worthy of
   being remembered, it is yet ever true that the gnawing even of worms
   are directed by the counsel of God, so that neither a herb nor a tree
   withers independently of his purpose. The same truth is declared by
   Christ when he says, that without the Father's appointment the sparrows
   fall not on the ground, (Matthew 10:29.) Thus much as to the worm.

   It is now added, that when the sun arose the day following, a wind was
   prepared. We here learn the same thing, -- that winds do not of
   themselves rise, or by chance, but are stirred up by a Divine power.
   There may indeed be found causes in nature why now the air is tranquil,
   and then it is disturbed by winds; but God's purpose regulates all
   these intermediate causes; so that this is ever true -- that nature is
   not some blind impulse, but a law settled by the will of God. God then
   ever regulates by his own counsel and hand whatever happens. The only
   difference is, that his works which flow in the usual course have the
   name of nature; and they are miracles and retain not the name of
   nature, when God changes their wonted course; but yet they all proceed
   from God as their author. Therefore with regard to this wind, we must
   understand that it was not usual or common; and yet that winds are
   daily no less stirred up by God's providence than this wind of which
   Jonah speaks. But God wrought then, so to speak, beyond the usual
   course of nature, though he daily preserves the regular order of nature
   itself.

   Let us now see why this whole narrative has been set down. Jonah
   confesses that he rejoiced with great joy, when he was sheltered from
   the extreme heat of the sun: but when the shrub withered, he was
   touched with so much grief that he wished to die. There is nothing
   superfluous here; for Jonah shows, with regard to his joy and his
   grief, how tender he was and how susceptible of both. Jonah here
   confesses his own sensibility, first by saying that he greatly
   rejoiced, and then by saying that he was so much grieved for the
   withered shrub, that through weariness of life he instantly desired
   death. There is then here an ingenuous confession of weakness; for
   Jonah in a very simple manner has mentioned both his joy and his grief.
   But he has distinctly expressed the vehemence of both feelings, that we
   might know that he was led away by his strong emotions, so that in the
   least things he was either inflamed with anger, or elated with joy
   beyond any bounds. This then was the case with him in his grief as well
   as in his joy. But he does not say that he prayed as before; but he
   adopts the word s'l, shal, which signifies to desire or wish. He
   desired, it is said, for his soul that he might die. It is hence
   probable that Jonah was so overwhelmed with grief that he did not lift
   up his heart to God; and yet we see that he was not neglected by God:
   for it immediately follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [56] Much has been written on the character of this plant. Modern
   critics have pretended to determine that it was the Ricinus, commonly
   called Palma Christi. It matters not what it was: its growth was
   doubtless miraculous. It may have been an indigenous plant, it may have
   been such a plant as never grew before or after. Two things are evident
   -- God prepared it, and prepared it to shelter Jonah. In a translation
   it would have been better either to retain the original name, or to
   give it the general name of a plant or shrub. To call it a gourd, an
   ivy, or a cucumber, is to convey an incorrect idea. -- Ed.

   Jonah 4:9

   9. And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd?
   And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.

   9. Et dixit Deus ad Jonam, An bene facis excandescendo apud te super
   cucurbitam? Et dixit, Bene facio irascendo apud me usque ad mortem.


   We see here that God had concealed himself for a time, but did not yet
   forsake his servant. He often looks on us from behind; that is, though
   we think that he has forgotten us, he yet observes how we go on, that
   he may in due time afford help: and hence it is that he recovers and
   raises up the falling, before we perceive that he is near. This was his
   manner with Jonah, when he began to address him: for, as we have said,
   grief had so oppressed the mind of the holy Prophets that it could no
   longer be raised up to God. Hence he desired to die; and still God did
   not forsake him. This was no common example of the invaluable mercy of
   God, with which he favors his own people, even when they precipitate
   themselves into ruin: such was the case with Jonah, who rushed headlong
   into a state of despair, and cared not for any remedy. God then did not
   wait until he was sought, but anticipated miserable Jonah, who was now
   seeking destruction to himself.

   He says, Doest thou well that thou art thus angry for the gourd? As
   though he had said, that he was too violently disturbed for a matter so
   trifling. And we must ever bear that in mind, of which we spoke more
   fully yesterday, -- that God did not merely reprove his servant,
   because he did not patiently bear the withering of the gourd -- what
   then? but because he became angry; for in anger there is ever an
   excess. Since then Jonah was thus grieved beyond measure, and without
   any restraint, it was justly condemned by God as a fault. I will now
   not repeat what I said yesterday respecting the enhancing of the crime,
   inasmuch as Jonah not only murmured on account of the withering of the
   shrub, but also disregarded himself, and boiled over with displeasure
   beyond all due limits.

   And the answer of Jonah confirms this, I do well, he says, in being
   angry even to death. We here see how obstinately the holy Prophet
   repelled the admonition of God, by which he ought to have been restored
   to a right mind. He was not ignorant that God spoke. Why then was he
   not smitten with shame? Why was he not moved by the authority of the
   speaker, so as immediately to repress the fierceness of his mind? But
   thus it commonly happens, when the minds of men are once blinded by
   some wrong feeling; though the Lord may thunder and fulminate from
   heaven, they will not hear, at least they will not cease violently to
   resist, as Jonah does here. Since then we find such an example of
   perverseness in this holy man, how much more ought every one of us to
   fear? Let us hence learn to repress in time our feelings, and instantly
   at the beginning to bridle them, lest if they should burst forth to a
   greater extent, we become at last altogether obstinate. I do well, he
   says, in being angry even to death. God charged his servant Jonah with
   the vice of anger; Jonah now indulges himself in his own madness, so
   that he says that desperation is not a vice: I do not sin, he says,
   though I am despairing; though I abandon myself to death as with mad
   fury, I do not yet sin.

   Who could have thought that the holy Prophet could have been brought
   into this state of mind? But let us be reminded, as I have already
   said, by this remarkable example, how furious and unreasonable are the
   passions of our flesh. There is, therefore, nothing better than to
   restrain them, before they gather more strength than they ought; for
   when any one feeds his vices, this obstinacy and hardness always
   follow. But to be angry, or to be in a fume even to death, is to feel
   such a weariness of life, as to give ourselves up of our own accord to
   death. It was not indeed the design of Jonah to lay violent hands on
   himself; but though he abstained from violence, he yet, as to the
   purpose of his mind, procured death to himself; for he submitted not to
   God, but was carried away by a blind impulse, so that he wished to
   throw away his life. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jonah 4:10-11

   10. Then said the Lord, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which
   thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a
   night, and perished in a night:

   10. Et dixit Jehova, Tu pepercisti cucurbitae, in qua non laborasti, et
   quam non extulisti; filia noctis fuit, et filia noctis transiit (hoc
   est nata fuit, vel, exorta una nocte, et nocte etiam una emarcuit.)

   11. And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more
   than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right
   hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?

   11. Et ego non parcerem Nineveh urbi magnae, in qua sunt duodecies
   decem millia hominum, quorum quisque non novit inter dexteram suam et
   sinistram suam, et animalia etiam multa?


   Here God explains the design he had in suddenly raising up the gourd,
   and then in causing it to perish or wither through the gnawing of a
   worm; it was to teach Jonah that misconduct towards the Ninevites was
   very inhuman. Though we find that the holy Prophet had become a prey to
   dreadful feelings, yet God, by this exhibition, does in a manner remind
   him of his folly; for, under the representation of a gourd, he shows
   how unkindly he desired the destruction of so populous a city as
   Nineveh.

   Yet this comparison may appear ill suited for the purpose. Jonah felt
   sorry for the gourd, but he only regarded himself: hence he was
   displeased, because the relief with which he was pleased was taken away
   from him. As then this inconvenience had driven Jonah to anger, the
   similitude may not seem appropriate when God thus reasons, Thou
   wouldest spare the gourd, should I not spare this great city? Nay, but
   he was not concerned for the gourd itself: if all the gourds of the
   world withered, he would not have been touched with any grief; but as
   he felt the greatest danger being scorched by the extreme heat of the
   sun, it was on this account that he was angry. To this I answer, --
   that though Jonah consulted his own advantage, yet this similitude is
   most suitable: for God preserves men for the purpose for which he has
   designed them. Jonah grieved for the withering of the gourd, because he
   was deprived of its shade: and God does not create men in vain; it is
   then no wonder that he wishes them to be saved. We hence see that Jonah
   was not unsuitably taught by this representation, how inhumanely he
   conducted himself towards the Ninevites. He was certainly but one
   individual; since then he made such an account of himself and the gourd
   only, how was it that he cast aside all care for so great and so
   populous a city? Ought not this to have come to his mind, that it was
   no wonder that God, the Creator and Father, had a care for so many
   thousands of men? Though indeed the Ninevites were alienated from God,
   yet as they were men, God, as he is the Father of the whole human race,
   acknowledged them as his own, at least to such an extent as to give
   them the common light of day, and other blessings of earthly life. We
   now then understand the import of this comparison: "Thou wouldest
   spare," he says, "the gourd, and should I not spare this great city?"

   It hence appears how frivolous is the gloss of Jerome, -- that Jonah
   was not angry on account of the deliverance of the city, but because he
   saw that his own nation would, through its means, be destroyed: for God
   repeats again that Jonah's feeling was quite different, -- that he bore
   with indignity the deliverance of the city from ruin. And less to be
   endured it is still, that Jerome excuses Jonah by saying that he nobly
   and courageously answered God, that he had not sinned in being angry
   even to death. That man dared, without any shame or discernment, to
   invent a pretense that he might excuse so disgraceful an obstinacy. But
   it is enough for us to understand the real meaning of the Prophet. Here
   then he shows, according to God's representation, that his cruelty was
   justly condemned for having anxiously desired the destruction of a
   populous city.

   But we ought to notice all the parts of the similitudes when he says,
   Thou wouldest have spared, etc. There is an emphasis in the pronoun
   'th, ate, for God compares himself with Jonah; "Who art thou? Doubtless
   a mortal man is not so inclined to mercy as I am. But thou takest to
   thyself this right -- to desire to spare the gourd, even thou who art
   made of clay. Now this gourd is not thy work, thou hast not labored for
   it, it has not proceeded from thy culture or toil; and further, thou
   hast not raised it up, and further still, it was the daughter of a
   night, and in one night it perished; it was an evanescent shrub or
   herb. If then thou regardest the nature of the gourd, if thou regardest
   thyself, and joinest together all the other circumstances, thou wilt
   find no reason for thy hot displeasure. But should not I, who am God,
   in whose hand are all things, whose prerogative and whose constant
   practice it is mercifully to bear with men -- should not I spare them,
   though they were worthy of destruction? and should not I spare a great
   city? The matter here is not concerning a little plant, but a large
   number of people. And, in the last place, it is a city, in which there
   are a hundred and twenty thousand men who know not how to distinguish
   between their right hand and the left."

   We now then see how emphatical are all the parts of this comparison.
   And though God's design was to reprove the foolish and sinful grief of
   Jonah, we may yet further collect a general instruction by reasoning in
   this manner, "We feel for one another, and so nature inclines us, and
   yet we are wicked and cruel. If then men are inclined to mercy through
   some hidden impulse of nature, what may not be hoped from the
   inconceivable goodness of God, who is the Creator of the whole world,
   and the Father of us all? and will not he, who is the fountain of all
   goodness and mercy spare us?"

   Now as to the number, Jonah mentions here twelve times ten thousand
   men, and that is as we have said, one hundred and twenty thousand. God
   shows here how paternally he cares for mankind. Every one of us is
   cherished by him with singular care: but yet he records here a large
   number, that it might be more manifest that he so much regards mankind
   that he will not inconsiderately fulminate against any one nation. And
   what he adds, that they could not distinguish between the right hand
   and the left, is to be referred, I have no doubt, to their age; and
   this opinion has been almost universally received. Some one, however
   has expressed a fear lest the city should be made too large by allowing
   such a number of men: he has, therefore, promiscuously included the
   old, as well as those of middle age and infants. He says that these
   could not distinguish between the right hand and the left, because they
   had not been taught in the school of God, nor understood the difference
   between right and wrong; for the unbelieving, as we know, went astray
   in their errors. But this view is too strained; and besides, there is
   no reason for this comment; for that city, we know, was not only like
   some great cities, many of which are at this day in Europe, but it
   surpassed most of the principal cities at this day. We know that in
   Paris there are more than four hundred thousand souls: the same is the
   case with other cities. I therefore reject this comment, as though
   Jonah was here speaking of all the Ninevites. But God, on the contrary,
   intended to show, that though there was the justest reason for
   destroying entirely the whole city, there were yet other reasons which
   justified the suspension of so dreadful a vengeance; for many infants
   were there who had not, by their own transgressions, deserved such a
   destruction.

   God then shows here to Jonah that he had been carried away by his own
   merciless zeal. Though his zeal, as it has been said, arose from a good
   principle, yet Jonah was influenced by a feeling far too vehement. This
   God proved, by sparing so many infants hitherto innocent. And to
   infants he adds the brute animals. Oxen were certainly superior to
   shrubs. If Jonah justly grieved for one withering shrub, it was far
   more deplorable and cruel for so many innocent animals to perish. We
   hence see how apposite are all the parts of this similitude, to make
   Jonah to loathe his folly, and to be ashamed of it; for he had
   attempted to frustrate the secret purpose of God, and in a manner to
   overrule it by his own will, so that the Ninevites might not be spared,
   who yet labored by true repentance to anticipate the divine judgment.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast, in various ways, testified, and
   daily continues to testify, how dear and precious to thee are mankind,
   and as we enjoy daily so many and so remarkable proofs of thy goodness
   and favor, -- O grant, that we may learn to rely wholly on thy
   goodness, many examples of which thou settest before us, and which thou
   wouldest have us continually to experience, that we may not only pass
   through our earthly course, but also confidently aspire to the hope of
   that blessed and celestial life which is laid up for us in heaven,
   through Christ our Lord. Amen.

   Calvin's Preface to Micah

   Among the Minor Prophets, Micah comes next, who is commonly called
   Micaiah. [57] But he was the second, as they say, of this name; for the
   first was the Micaiah who had a contest with the wicked king Ahab; and
   he then exercised his Prophetic office. But the second was in the same
   age with Isaiah, perhaps a little later: at least Isaiah had been
   performing his office some years before Micah had been called. It
   appears then that he was added to Isaiah, that he might confirm his
   doctrine; for that holy man had to do with ungodly men, with men of a
   hardened neck, yea, and so wicked, that they were wholly irreclaimable.
   That their doctrine therefore might be more entitled to credit, it
   pleased God that Isaiah and Micah should deliver their message at the
   same time, as it were, with one mouth, and avow their consent, that all
   the disobedient might be proved guilty.

   But I will now come to his words: for the contents of this Book suggest
   what is useful for our instruction. [58]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [57] The confusion of the name has been through the Septuagint, in
   which Michaiah, the son of Imlah, about a hundred years before, is
   rendered Michaias, as well as this Prophet. The son of Imlah in Hebrew
   is mykyh, while our Prophet is mykh. -- Ed.

   [58] "This Book," says Henderson, "may be divided into two parts; the
   first consisting of chapters 1-5; and the second, the two remaining
   chapters, which are more general and didactic in their character."

   Micah 1:1

   1. The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days
   of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning
   Samaria and Jerusalem.

   1. Sermo Jehovae qui factus est (vel, directus) ad Michah Morasthitem,
   diebus Jotham, Achaz, Jehizkiae, regum Judae, quem vidit super Samariam
   et Jerusalem.


   This inscription, in the first place, shows the time in which Micah
   lived, and during which God employed his labors. And this deserves to
   be noticed: for at this day his sermons would be useless, or at least
   frigid, except his time were known to us, and we be thereby enabled to
   compare what is alike and what is different in the men of his age, and
   in those of our own: for when we understand that Micah condemned this
   or that vice, as we may also learn from the other Prophets and from
   sacred history, we are able to apply more easily to ourselves what he
   then said, inasmuch as we can view our own life as it were in a mirror.
   This is the reason why the Prophets are wont to mention the time in
   which they executed their office.

   But how long Micah followed the course of his vocation we cannot with
   certainty determine. It is, however, probable that he discharged his
   office as a Prophet for thirty years: it may be that he exceeded forty
   years; for he names here three kings, the first of whom, that is
   Jotham, reigned sixteen years; and he was followed by Ahab, who also
   reigned as many years. If then Micah was called at the beginning of the
   first reign, he must have prophesied for thirty-two years, the time of
   the two kings. Then the reign of Hezekiah followed, which continued to
   the twenty-ninth year: and it may be, that the Prophet served God to
   the death, or even beyond the death, of Hezekiah. [59] We hence see
   that the number of his years cannot with certainty be known; though it
   be sufficiently evident that he taught not for a few years, but that he
   so discharged his office, that for thirty years he was not wearied, but
   constantly persevered in executing the command of God.

   I have said that he was contemporary with Isaiah: but as Isaiah began
   his office under Uzziah, we conclude that he was older. Why then was
   Micah joined to him? That the Lord might thus break down the
   stubbornness of the people. It was indeed enough that one man was sent
   by God to bear witness to the truth; but it pleased God that a
   testimony should be borne by the mouth of two, and that holy Isaiah
   should be assisted by this friend and, as it were, his colleague. And
   we shall hereafter find that they adopted the very same words; but
   there was no emulation between them, so that one accused the other of
   theft, when he repeated what had been said. Nothing was more gratifying
   to each of them than to receive a testimony from his colleague; and
   what was committed to them by God they declared not only in the same
   sense and meaning, but also in the same words, and, as it were, with
   one mouth.

   Of the expression, that the word was sent to him, we have elsewhere
   reminded you, that it ought not to be understood of private teaching,
   as when the word of God is addressed to individuals; but the word was
   given to Micah, that he might be God's ambassador to us. It means then
   that he came furnished with commands, as one sustaining the person of
   God himself; for he brought nothing of his own, but what the Lord
   commanded him to proclaim. But as I have elsewhere enlarged on this
   subject, I now only touch on it briefly.

   This vision, he says, was given him against two cities Samaria and
   Jerusalem [60] It is certain that the Prophet was specifically sent to
   the Jews; and Maresah, from which he arose, as it appears from the
   inscription, was in the tribe of Judah: for Morasthite was an
   appellative, derived from the place Maresah. [61] But it may be asked,
   why does he say that visions had been given him against Samaria? We
   have said elsewhere, that though Hosea was specifically and in a
   peculiar manner destined for the kingdom of Israel, he yet by the way
   mingled sometimes those things which referred to the tribe or kingdom
   of Judah: and such was also the case with our Prophet; he had a regard
   chiefly to his own kindred, for he knew that he was appointed for them;
   but, at the same time, he overlooked not wholly the other part of the
   people; for the kingdom of Israel was not so divided from the tribe of
   Judah that no connection remained: for God was unwilling that his
   covenant should be abolished by their defection from the kingdom of
   David. We hence see, that though Micah spent chiefly his labors in
   behalf of the Jews, he yet did not overlook or entirely neglect the
   Israelites.

   But the title must be restricted to one part of the book; for
   threatenings only form the discourse here. But we shall find that
   promises, full of joy, are also introduced. The inscription then does
   not include all the contents of the book; but as his purpose was to
   begin with threatenings, and to terrify the Jews by setting before them
   the punishment that was at hand, this inscription was designedly given.
   There is, at the same time, no doubt but that the Prophet was ill
   received by the Jews on this account; for they deemed it a great
   indignity, and by no means to be endured, to be tied up in the same
   bundle with the Israelites; for Samaria was an abomination to the
   kingdom of Judah; and yet the Prophet here makes no difference between
   Samaria and Jerusalem. This was then an exasperating sentence: but we
   see how boldly the Prophet performs the office committed to him; for he
   regarded not what would be agreeable to men, nor endeavored to draw
   them by smooth things: though his message was disliked, he yet
   proclaimed it, for he was so commanded, nor could he shake off the yoke
   of his vocation. Let us now proceed --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [59] It is probable that the greater part of his Prophecy was written
   in the days of this king; for a portion of what is contained in the
   third chapter is referred to in Jeremiah 26:18, 19, as having been
   delivered "in the days of Hezekiah."--Ed.

   [60] "He mentions Samaria first," says Marckius, "not because it was
   superior to Jerusalem, or more regarded by the Prophet, but because it
   would be first in undergoing judgment, as it had been first in
   transgression." The preposition l is rendered by some, "against," and
   not "concerning." Calvin renders it in his version super, and in his
   comment, contra -- Ed.

   [61] It was a village, according to Eusebius and Jerome, west of
   Jerusalem, near Eleutheropolis, not far from the borders of the
   Philistines. See Joshua 15:44; 1 Chronicles 4:21; 2 Chronicles 9:8;
   14:10. There is another circumstance, besides that of his birth in the
   land of Judah, which tends to prove his special mission to the Jews, --
   he mentions in the first verse only the kings of Judah. -- Ed.

   Micah 1:2

   2. Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and
   let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.

   2. Audite populi omnes, ausculta terra et plenitudo ejus, et sit
   Dominus Jehova vobis (vel, inter vos, vel, contra vos, potius) in
   testem, et Dominus e palatio (vel, templo) sanctitatis suae.


   The Prophet here rises into an elevated style, being not content with a
   simple and calm manner of speaking. We hence may learn, that having
   previously tried the disposition of the people, he knew the
   stubbornness of almost all classes: for except he was persuaded that
   the people would be rebellious and obstinate, he would certainly have
   used some mildness, or have at least endeavored to lead them of their
   own accord rather than to drive them thus violently. There is then no
   doubt but that the obstinacy of the people and their wickedness were
   already fully known to him, even before he began to address one word to
   them. But this difficulty did not prevent him from obeying God's
   command. He found it necessary in the meantime to add vehemence to his
   teaching; for he saw that he addressed the deaf, yea, stupid men, who
   were destitute of every sense of religion, and who had hardened
   themselves against God, and had not only fallen away through want of
   thought, but had also become immersed in their sins, and were wickedly
   and abominably obstinate in them. Since then the Prophet saw this, he
   makes here a bold beginning, and addresses not only his own nation, for
   whom he was appointed a Teacher; but he speaks to the whole world.

   For what purpose does he say, Hear, all ye people? [62] It was not
   certainly his object to proclaim indiscriminately to all the truth of
   God for the same end: but he summons here all nations as witnesses or
   judges, that the Jews might understand that their impiety would be made
   evident to all, except they repented, and that there was no reason for
   them to hope that they could conceal their baseness, for God would
   expose their hidden crimes as it were on an open stage. We hence see
   how emphatical are the words, when the Prophet calls on all nations and
   would have them to be witnesses of the judgment which God had resolved
   to bring on his people.

   He afterwards adds, Let also the earth give ear and its fullness We may
   take the earth, by metonymy, for its inhabitants; but as it is added,
   and its fullness, the Prophet, I doubt not, meant here to address the
   very earth itself, though it be without reason. He means that so
   dreadful would be the judgment of God, as to shake created things which
   are void of sense; and thus he more severely upbraids the Jews with
   their stupor, that they heedlessly neglected the word of God, which yet
   would shake all the elements by its power.

   He then immediately turns his discourse to the Jews: after having
   erected God's tribunal and summoned all the nations, that they might
   form as it were a circle of a solemn company, he says, There will be
   for me the Lord Jehovah against you for a witness -- the Lord from the
   temple of his holiness. By saying that God would be as a witness for
   him, he not only affirms that he was sent by God, but being as it were
   inflamed with zeal, he appeals here to God, and desires him to be
   present, that the wickedness and obstinacy of the people might not be
   unpunished; as though he said, "Let God, whose minister I am, be with
   me, and punish your impiety; let him prove that he is the author of
   this doctrine, which I declare from his mouth and by his command; let
   him not suffer you to escape unpunished, if ye do not repent."

   We now then perceive the meaning of the Prophet, when he says that God
   would be for him a witness; as though he had said, that there was no
   room here to trifle; for if the Jews thought to elude God's judgment
   they greatly deceived themselves; inasmuch as when he has given a
   command to his servants to treat with his people, he is at the same
   time present as a judge, and will not suffer his word to be rejected
   without immediately undertaking his own cause.

   Nor is this addition superfluous, The Lord from the temple of his
   holiness: for we know how thoughtlessly the Jews were wont to boast
   that God dwelt in the midst of them. And this presumption so blinded
   them that they despised all the Prophets; for they thought it unlawful
   that any thing should be said to their disgrace, because they were the
   holy people of God, his holy heritage and chosen nation. Inasmuch then
   as the Lord had adopted them, they falsely boasted of his favors. Since
   then the Prophet knew that the people insolently gloried in those
   privileges, with which they had been honored by God, he now declares
   that God would be the avenger of impiety from his temple; as though he
   said, Ye boast that God is bound to you, and that he has so bound up
   his faith to you as to render his name to you a sport: he indeed dwells
   in his temple; but from thence he will manifest himself as an avenger,
   as he sees that you are perverse in your wickedness. We hence see that
   the Prophet beats down that foolish arrogance, by which the Jews were
   inflated; yea, he turns back on their own heads what they were wont
   boastingly to bring forward. After having made this introduction, to
   awaken slumbering men with as much vehemence as he could, he subjoins
   --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [62] smv mym klm, "Hear, ye peoples, all of them." Were it not for a
   similar anomaly as to number in the following line, "Give ear, thou
   earth, and its fullness," we might think that kln is here a mistake for
   klkm, as it is evidently the case in 1 Samuel 6:4, and Job 17:10; for
   in these two places there are several MSS. Which have klkm, though here
   there is no variety. Some, to get rid of the difficulty, have suggested
   that klm here is to be construed as an adverb, "universally," regarding
   it as assuming the same form with chnm, "gratuitously," and ryqm,
   "vainly." But such irregularity is common in Hebrew; there is therefore
   no need of having recourse to such expedients. The word mym, peoples,
   may be rendered nations: for, notwithstanding the dissent of Drusius,
   what Horsley says seems to be correct, that m in the plural number
   designates the heathen nations, as distinguished from the people of
   Israel. The verse literally is this, -- Hear, ye nations, -- all of
   them;
   Give ear, thou earth, -- even its fullness;
   And the Lord Jehovah shall be against you a witness
   The Lord from the temple of his holiness. -- Ed.

   Micah 1:3-4

   3. For, behold, the Lord cometh forth out of his place, and will come
   down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.

   3. Quia ecce Jehova egreditur e loco suo, et descendet, et calcabit
   super excelsa terrae:

   4. And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall
   be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as the waters that are poured
   down a steep place.

   4. Et liquefient montes sub eo, et solventur (vel, dehiscent) valles;
   sicut cera a conspectu ignis, sicut aquae in locum inferiorem actae.


   The Prophet pursues the same subject; and he dwells especially on this
   -- that God would be a witness against his people from his sanctuary.
   He therefore confirms this, when he says that God would come from his
   place Some interpreters do at the same time take this view -- that the
   temple would hereafter be deprived of God's presence, and would hence
   become profane, according to what Ezekiel declares. For as the Jews
   imagined that God was connected with them as long as the temple stood,
   and this false imagination proved to them an allurement, as it were, to
   sin, as on this account they took to themselves greater liberty, --
   this was the reason why the Prophet Ezekiel declares that God was no
   longer in the temple; and the Lord had shown to him by a vision that he
   had left his temple, so that he would no longer dwell there. Some, as I
   have said, give a similar explanation of this passage; but this sense
   does not seem to suit the context. I therefore take another view of
   this sentence -- that God would go forth from his place. But yet it is
   doubted what place the Prophet refers to: for many take it to be
   heaven, and this seems probable, for immediately after he adds, Descend
   shall God, and he will tread on the high places of the earth This
   descent seems indeed to point out a higher place: but as the temple, we
   know, was situated on a high and elevated spot, on mount Zion, there is
   nothing inconsistent in saying that God descended from his temple to
   chastise the whole of Judea as it deserved. Then the going forth of God
   is by no means ambiguous in its meaning, for he means that God would at
   length go forth, as it were, in a visible form. With regard then to the
   place, I am inclined to refer it to the temple; and this clause, I have
   no doubt, has proceeded from the last verse.

   But why is going forth here ascribed to God? Because the Jews had
   abused the forbearance of God in worshipping him with vain ceremonies
   in the temple; and at the same time they thought that they had escaped
   from his hand. As long then as God spared them, they thought that he
   was, as it were, bound to them, because he dwelt among them. Besides,
   as the legal and shadowy worship prevailed among them, they imagined
   that God rested in their temple. But now the Prophet says, "He will go
   forth: ye have wished hitherto to confine God to the tabernacle, and ye
   have attempted to pacify him with your frivolous puerilities: but ye
   shall know that his hand and his power extend much farther: he shall
   therefore come and show what that majesty is which has been hitherto a
   derision to you." For when hypocrites set to sale their ceremonies to
   God, do they not openly trifle with him, as though he were a child? and
   do they not thus rob him of his power and authority? Such was the
   senselessness of that people. The Prophet therefore does not say
   without reason that God would go forth, that he might prove to the Jews
   that they were deluded by their own vain imaginations, when they thus
   took away from God what necessarily belonged to him, and confined him
   to a corner in Judea and fixed him there, as though he rested and dwelt
   there like a dead idol.

   The particle, Behold, is emphatical: for the Prophet intended here to
   shake off from the Jews their torpidity, inasmuch as nothing was more
   difficult to them than to be persuaded and to believe that punishment
   was nigh at hand, when they flattered themselves that God was
   propitious to them. Hence that they might no longer cherish this
   willfulness, he says, Behold, come shall the Lord, forth shall he go
   from his place Isaiah has a passage like this in an address to the
   people, Isaiah 26; but the object of it is different; for Isaiah
   intended to threaten the enemies of the Church and heathen nations: but
   here Micah denounces war on the chosen people, and shows that God thus
   dwelt in his temple, that the Jews might perceive that his hand was
   opposed to them, as they had so shamefully despised him, and, by their
   false imaginations reduced, as it were, to nothing his power.

   He shall tread, he says, on the high places of the earth. By the high
   places of the earth I do not understand superstitious places, but those
   well fortified. We know that fortresses were then fixed, for the most
   part, on elevated situations. The Prophet then intimates, that there
   would be no place into which God's vengeance would not penetrate,
   however well fortified it might be: "No enclosures," he says, "shall
   hinder God from penetrating into the inmost parts of your fortresses;
   he shall tread on the high places of the earth." At the same time, I
   doubt not but that he alludes, by this kind of metaphor, to the chief
   men, who thought themselves exempted from the common lot of mankind;
   for they excelled so much in power, riches, and authority, that they
   would not be classed with the common people. The Prophet then
   intimates, that those, who were become proud through a notion of their
   own superiority would not be exempt from punishment.

   And he afterwards adds, that this going forth of God would be terrible,
   Melt, he says, shall the mountains under him It hence appears, that the
   Prophet did not speak in the last verse of the departure of God, as
   though he was going to forsake his own temple, but that he, on the
   contrary, described his going forth from the temple, that he might
   ascend his tribunal and execute punishment on the whole people, and
   thus, in reality, prove that he would be a judge, because he had been
   very daringly despised. Hence he says, Melt shall the mountains under
   him, the valleys shall be rent, or cleave, as wax before the fire, as
   waters rolling into a lower place [63] The Prophets do not often
   describe God in a manner so awful; but this representation is to be
   referred to the circumstance of this passage, for he sets forth God
   here as the judge of the people: it was therefore necessary that he
   should be exhibited as furnished and armed with powers that he might
   stake such vengeance on the Jews as they deserved. And other similar
   passages we shall hereafter meet with, and like to those which we found
   in Hosea. God then is said to melt the mountains, and he is said to
   strike the valleys with such terror that they cleave under him; in
   short, he is said so to terrify all elements, that the very mountains,
   however stony they may be, melt like wax or like waters which flow, --
   because he could not otherwise produce a real impression on a people so
   obstinate, and who, as it has been said, so flattered themselves even
   in their vices.

   We may further easily learn what application to make of this truth in
   our day. We find the Papists boasting of the title Church, and, in a
   manner, with vain confidence, binding God to themselves, because they
   have baptism, though they have adulterated it with their superstitions;
   and then, they think that they have Christ, because they still retain
   the name of a Church. Had the Lord promised that his dwelling would be
   at Rome, we yet see how foolish and frivolous would be such boasting:
   for though the temple was at Jerusalem, yet the Lord went forth thence
   to punish the sins of the people, yea, even of the chosen people. We
   further know, that it is folly to bind God now to one place, for it is
   his will that his name should be celebrated without any difference
   through the whole world. Wheresoever, then, the voice of the Gospel
   sounds, God would have us to know that he is present there. What the
   Papists then proudly boast of -- that Christ is joined to them -- will
   turn out to their own condemnation; -- why so? Because the Lord will
   prove that he is the avenger of so impious and shameful a profanation,
   as they not only presumptuously lay claim to his name, but also tear it
   in pieces, and contaminate it with their sacrilegious abominations.

   Again, since God is said to melt the mountains with his presence, let
   us hence learn to rouse up all our feelings whenever God comes forth
   not that we may flee to a distance from him, but that we may reverently
   receive his word, so that he may afterwards appear to us a kind and
   reconciled Father. For when we become humble, and the pride and height
   of our flesh is subdued, he then immediately receives us, as it were,
   into his gentle bosom, and gives us an easy access to him, yea, he
   invites us to himself with all possible kindness. That the Lord then
   may thus kindly receive us, let us learn to fear as soon as he utters
   his voice: but let not this fear make us to flee away but only humble
   us, so that we may render true obedience to the word of the Lord. It
   follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [63] These two similes, as observed by Marckius and others, refer not
   to the same thing, but to the two things previously mentioned,--the
   wax, to the mountains,--and the waters, to the valleys. This kind of
   order, in a sentence, is common in Hebrew. The Septuagint presents an
   instance, not uncommon, of an attempt to reconcile what, from not
   apprehending the sense, appeared incongruous; for motion is ascribed to
   the mountains-- saleuthesetai ta ore, and melting to the
   valleys--takesontai, quite contrary to the meaning of the words in
   Hebrew. Newcome renders the last line thus, -- "As waters poured down a
   steep place." Henderson renders the last word, "a precipice;" and
   Marckius, declive--"a declivity." I would give this version of the
   whole verse, -- For, behold, Jehovah shall go forth from his place;
   Yea, he shall descend and tread on the high places of the land;
   And dissolve shall the mountains under him,
   And the valleys shall burst forth;
   Like the wax before the fire,
   Like waters rolling down a declivity. The verb vq is applied to express
   the bursting out of waters from a fountain, of the young when emerging
   from the egg, and of light dispelling darkness. It is here in Hithpael,
   and only in one other place, Joshua 9:13; where it means the bursting
   of wine bottles, made of leather. The word mvrd is going down, descent,
   declivity, katabasis, Sept. See Joshua 10:11; Jeremiah 48:5 "Do men
   trust to the height and strength of mountains, as if they were
   sufficient to bear up their hopes and bear off their fears? They shall
   be molten under him. -- Do they trust to the fruitfulness of the
   valleys and their products? They shall be cleft, or rent, -- and be
   wasted away as the ground is by the waters that are poured down a steep
   place." -- Henry.

   Micah 1:5

   5. For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the
   house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is it not Samaria?
   and what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem?

   5. Propter scelus [64] Jacob totum hoc, et propter transgressiones
   domus Israel: quod scelus Jacob? Annon Samaria? Et quae excelsa
   Jehudah? Annon Jerusalem?


   The Prophet teaches, in this verse, that God is not angry for nothing;
   though when he appears rigid, men expostulate with him, and clamor as
   though he were cruel. That men may, therefore, acknowledge that God is
   a just judge, and that he never exceeds moderation in punishments, the
   Prophet here distinctly states that there was a just cause, why God
   denounced so dreadful a judgment on his chosen people, -- even because
   not only a part of the people, but the whole body had, through their
   impiety, fallen away; for by the house of Jacob, and by the house of
   Israel, he means that impiety had everywhere prevailed, so that no part
   was untainted. The meaning then is, -- that the contagion of sin had
   spread through all Israel, that no portion of the country was free from
   iniquity, that no corner of the land could bring an excuse for its
   defection; the Lord therefore shows that he would be the judge of them
   all, and would spare neither small nor great.

   We now then understand the Prophet's object in this verse: As he had
   before taught how dreadful would be God's vengeance against all the
   ungodly, so now he mentions their crimes, that they might not complain
   that they were unjustly treated, or that God employed too much
   severity. The Prophet then testifies that the punishment, then near at
   hand, would be just.

   He now adds, What is the wickedness of Jacob? The Prophet, no doubt,
   indirectly reproves here the hypocrisy which ruled dominant among the
   people. For he asks not for his own satisfaction or in his own person;
   but, on the contrary, he relates, by way of imitation, (mimetikos, --
   imitatively) what he knew to be ever on their lips, "Oh! what sort of
   thing is this sin? Why! thou assumest here a false principle, -- that
   we are wicked men, ungodly and perfidious: thou does us a grievous
   wrong." Inasmuch, then, as hypocrites thought themselves pure, having
   wiped, as it were, their mouths, whenever they eluded reproofs by their
   sophistries, the Prophet borrows a question, as it were, from their own
   lips, "Of what kind is this wickedness? Of what sort is that
   transgression?" As though he said, "I know what ye are wont to do, when
   any one of the Prophets severely reproves you; ye instantly contend
   with him, and are ready with your objections: but what do you gain? If
   you wish to know what your wickedness is, it is Samaria; and where your
   high places are, they are at Jerusalem." It is the same as if he had
   said, "I do not here contend with the common people, but I attack the
   first men: my contest then is with the princes themselves, who surpass
   others in dignity, and are, therefore, unwilling to be touched."

   But it sometimes happens that the common people become degenerated,
   while some integrity remains among the higher orders: but the Prophet
   shows that the diseases among the people belonged to the principal men;
   and hence he names the two chief cities, Jerusalem and Samaria, as he
   had said before, in the first verse, that he proclaimed predictions
   against these: and yet it is certain, that the punishment was to be in
   common to the whole people. But as they thought that Jerusalem and
   Samaria would be safe, though the whole country were destroyed, the
   Prophet threatens them by name: for, relying first on their strength,
   they thought themselves unassailable; and then, the eyes of nearly all,
   we know, were dazzled with empty splendor, powers and dignity: thus the
   ungodly wholly forget that they are men, and what they owe to God, when
   elevated in the world. So great an arrogance could not be subdued,
   except by sharp and severe words, such as the Prophet, as we see, here
   employs. He then says, that the wickedness of Israel was Samaria; the
   fountain of all iniquities was the royal city, which yet ought to have
   ruled the whole land with wisdom and justice: but what any more
   remains, when kings and their counselors tread under foot all regard
   for what is just and right, and having cast away every shame, rise up
   in rebellion against God and men? When therefore kings thus fall from
   their dignity, an awful ruin must follow.

   This is the reason why the Prophet says that the wickedness of Israel
   was Samaria, that thence arose all iniquities. But we must at the same
   time bear in mind, that the Prophet speaks not here of gross crimes;
   but, on the contrary, he directs his reproof against ungodly and
   perverted forms of worship; and this appears more evident from the
   second clause, in which he mentions transgressions in connection with
   the high places. We hence see, that all sins in general are not here
   reproved, but their vicious modes of worship, by which religion had
   been polluted among the Jews as well as the Israelites. But it might
   seem very unjust, that the Prophet should charge with sin those forms
   of worship in which the Jews laboriously exercised themselves with the
   object of pacifying God. But we see how God regards as nothing whatever
   men blend with his worship out of their own heads. And this is our
   principal contest at this day with the Papists; we call their perverted
   and spurious modes of worship abominations: they think that what is
   heavenly is to be blended with what is earthly. We diligently labor,
   they say, for this end -- that God may be worshipped. True; but, at the
   same time, ye profane his worship by your inventions; and it is
   therefore an abomination. We now then see how foolish and frivolous are
   those delusions, when men follow their own wisdom in the duty of
   worshipping God: for the Prophet here, in the name of God, fulminates,
   as it were, from heaven against all superstitions, and shows that no
   sin is more detestable, than that preposterous caprice with which
   idolaters are inflamed, when they observe such forms of worship as they
   have themselves invented.

   Now with regard to the high places, we must notice, that there was a
   great difference between the Jews and the Israelites at that time as to
   idolatry. The Israelites had so fallen, that they were altogether
   degenerated; nothing could be seen among them that had an affinity to
   the true and legitimate worship of God: but the Jews had retained some
   form of religion, they had not thus abandoned themselves; but yet they
   had a mixture of superstitions; such as one would find, were he to
   compare the gross Popery of this day with that middle course which
   those men invent, who seem to themselves to be very wise, fearing,
   forsooth, as they do, the offenses of the world; and hence they form
   for us a mixture, I know not what, from the superstitions of the Papacy
   and from the Reformation, as they call it. Something like this was the
   mixture at Jerusalem. We however see, that the Prophet pronounces the
   same sentence against the Jews and the Israelites and that is, that God
   will allow nothing that proceeds from the inventions of men to be
   joined to his word. Since then God allows no such mixtures, the Prophet
   here says that there was no less sin on the high places of Judea, than
   there was in those filthy abominations which were then dominant among
   the people of Israel. But the remainder we must defer until to-morrow.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [64] phs, rendered scelus wickedness, by Calvin, means evidently
   defectio -- defection -- apostacy, as rendered by Junius and Tremelius.
   cht'vt, transgressiones -- transgressions, rather, sins. Several MSS.
   And the Septuagint have cht't, sin; but the plural is more suitable to
   this place, to correspond with the high places at the end of the verse.
   It is evident, from the context that Jacob means Samaria or the ten
   tribes, and that the house, or family of Israel, means what is not
   usual, the tribe of Judah. (See 2 Chronicles 28:19.) Israel seems here
   to be taken as a special distinction of God's people. Judah was still
   in the name of the true Israel, while the ten tribes were apostates
   from the faith. It is better to adopt the future tense in this verse,
   that it may correspond with the preceding. When the auxiliary verb is
   supplied, it must ever be regulated as to its tense by the context.
   Then the first line should be, -- For the defection of Jacob shall all
   this be. Or it may be rendered, "shall all these things be," kl-z't;
   for z't is plural as well as singular; and panta tauta is the rendering
   of the Septuagint. Grotius and some others give this version of the
   four last lines,-- What is the origin of the defection of Jacob?
   Is it not Samaria?
   What is the origin of the high places of Judah?
   Is it not Jerusalem? Who or what is the defection of Jacob? No doubt
   means, Who is the author, or what is the cause or origin of his
   defection? It is the same form of expression, as when it is said, that
   God is our salvation, that is, the author of it. -- Ed.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that, since to a perverse, and in every way a
   rebellious people, thou didst formerly show so much grace, as to exhort
   them continually to repentance, and to stretch forth thy hand to them
   by thy Prophets, -- O grant, that the same word may sound in our ears;
   and when we do not immediately profit by thy teaching, O cast us not
   away, but, by thy Spirit, so subdue all our thoughts and affections,
   that we, being humbled, may give glory to thy majesty, such as is due
   to thee, and that, being allured by thy paternal favor, we may submit
   ourselves to thee, and, at the same time, embrace that mercy which thou
   offerest and presentest to us in Christ, that we may not doubt but thou
   wilt be a Father to us, until we shall at length enjoy that eternal
   inheritance, which has been obtained for us by the, blood of thine
   only-begotten Son. Amen.

   Micah 1:6

   6. Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, and as
   plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into
   the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.

   6. Et ponam Samariam (hoc est, ideo; enim hic sumitur pro illativa
   particula; ponam igitur Samariam) in acervum agri, in plantationes
   vinae; et devolvam in vallem lapides ejus, et fundamenta ejus retegam.


   Though Micah intended especially to devote his services to the Jews, as
   we have said yesterday, he yet, in the first place, passes judgment on
   Samaria; for it was his purpose afterwards to speak more fully against
   Jerusalem and the whole of Judea. And this state of the case ought to
   be borne in mind; for the Prophet does not begin with the Israelites,
   because he directs his discourse peculiarly to them; but his purpose
   was briefly to reprove them, and then to address more especially his
   own people, for it was for this purpose that he was called. Now, as he
   threatens destruction to Samaria and the whole kingdom of Israel on
   account of their corrupted forms of worship, we may hence learn how
   displeasing to God is superstition, and that he regards nothing so much
   as the true worship of his name. There is no reason here for men to
   advance this position -- that they do not designedly sin; for God shows
   how he is to be worshipped by us. Whenever, then, we deviate in any
   thing from the rule which he has prescribed, we manifest, in that
   particular, our rebellion and obstinacy. Hence the superstitious ever
   act like fools with regard to God, for they will not submit to his
   word, so as to be thereby alone made wise.

   And he says, I will set Samaria as an heap of the field, that is, such
   shall be the ruins that they shall differ nothing from the heaps of the
   fields: for husband men, we know, when they find stones in their
   fields, throw them into some corner, that they may not be in the way of
   the slough. Like such heaps then, as are seen in the fields, Samaria
   would be, according to what God declared. He then says, that the place
   would be empty, so that vines would be planted there; and, in the third
   place, that its stones would be scattered through the valley; as when
   one casts stones where there is a wide plain, they run and roll far and
   wide; so would be the scattering of Samaria according to what the
   Prophet says, it was to be like the rolling of stones in a wide field.
   He adds, in the fourth place, I will uncover her foundations, that is,
   I will entirely demolish it, so that a stone, as Christ says, may not
   remain on a stone, (Matthew 24:2.) We now perceive the import of the
   words; and we also perceive that the reason why the Prophet denounces
   on Samaria so severe a judgment was, because it had corrupted the
   legitimate worship of God with its own inventions; for it had devised,
   as we well know, many idols, so that the whole authority of the law had
   been abolished among the Israelites. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Micah 1:7

   7. And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all
   the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols
   thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered it of the hire of an
   harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot.

   7. Et omnia sculptilia [65] ejus diruentur, et omnes mercedes ejus
   exurentur igne (alii transferunt, donaria,) et omnia idola ejus ponam
   in vastitatem; quia e mercede meretricis congregavit, et ad mercedem
   meretricis revertentur.


   The Prophet goes on with the same subject, and says, that the ruin of
   Samaria was at hand, so that its idols would be broken, and also, that
   its wealth would be destroyed which she had gathered by illegitimate
   means, and which she thought to be the reward of her idolatry. But God
   mentions idols here expressly by his Prophet, in order to confirm what
   we noticed yesterday -- that the cause of vengeance was, because
   Samaria had abandoned itself to ungodly forms of worship, and had
   departed from the Law. That the Israelites might then understand the
   cause for which God would so severely punish them, the Prophet here
   makes express mention of their graven images and idols. God is not
   indeed angry with stones and wood; but he observes the abuse and the
   perversion of them, when men pollute themselves by wickedly worshipping
   such things. This is the reason why God says here that the graven
   images of Samaria would be broken in pieces, and that its idols would
   be destroyed.

   With regard to the wages, the Prophet no doubt designed to stamp with
   disgrace all the wealth of Samaria. 'tnn, atanen, is properly a gift or
   a present. But as he twice repeats it, and says, that what Samaria
   possessed was the reward of an harlot, and then, that it would return
   to the reward of an harlot, he, in the first place, I have no doubt,
   upbraids the Israelites, because they, after the manner of harlots and
   strumpets, had heaped together their great riches: and this was done by
   Jeroboam, who constructed a new form of worship, in order to secure his
   own kingdom. The Israelites then began to flourish; and we also know
   how wealthy that kingdom became, and how proud they were on account of
   their riches. As, then, the Israelites despised the kingdom of Judah,
   and thought themselves in every way happy, and as they ascribed all
   this, as we have seen in Hosea, to their superstitions, Micah speaks
   here according to their view of things, when he says, Idolatry has been
   gainful to you, this splendor dazzles your eyes; but your rewards I
   have already doomed to the burning: they shall then be burnt, and thus
   perish. Hosea also, as we have seen, made use of the same comparison,
   -- that the children of Israel felicitated themselves in their impiety,
   like a harlot, who, while she gains many presents from those who admire
   her beauty, seems not conscious of her turpitude and baseness: such
   were the Israelites. The Prophets therefore does not say, without
   reason, Behold, your rewards, by burning, shall perish, or, be consumed
   with fire. Why so? Because ye have gathered them, he says, from the
   reward of an harlot, and all this shall return to the reward of an
   harlot.

   This last clause ought to be restricted to the gifts or wealth of
   Samaria; for it cannot properly be applied to idols or graven images.
   The import of the whole then is that God would be the avenger of
   idolatry with regard to the city of Samaria and the whole kingdom of
   Israel. Besides, as the Israelites boasted that their ungodly forms of
   worship turned out to their happiness and prosperity, God declares that
   the whole of this success would be evanescent, like that of the harlot,
   who amasses great wealth, which soon vanishes away: and we see that
   thus it commonly happens.

   Some explain the passage thus, -- that the gifts, with which the
   Israelites adorned their temples, would return to be the reward of an
   harlot, that is, would he transferred to Chaldea, and that the
   Babylonians would, in their turn, adorn with them their idols. But this
   view is not suitable to the place; for the Prophet does not say that
   what Samaria had gathered would be a prey or a spoil to enemies but
   that it would perish by fire. [66] He speaks therefore, proverbially
   when he says that the produce, from the reward of an harlot, would
   return to be the reward of an harlot, that is, that it would become
   nothing; for the Lord sets a curse on such riches as strumpets gain by
   their baseness, while they prostitute themselves. Since, then, the
   whole of such wealth is under the curse of God, it must necessarily
   soon pass away like smoke: and this, in my view, is the real meaning of
   the Prophet. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [65] phsylym, from phsl, to chip or cut with a tool. They were graven
   or carved images, made of wood, and overlaid with gold or silver. "The
   graven image," says Bishop Horsley, "Was not a thing wrought in metal
   by the tool of the workman we should now call an engraver; nor was the
   molten image an image made of metal. In fact, the graven image and the
   molten image are the same thing under different names. The images of
   the ancient idolaters were first cut out of wood by the carpenter, as
   is very evident from the Prophet Isaiah. This figure of wood was
   overlaid with plates, either of gold or of silver, or, sometimes
   perhaps, of an inferior metal. And, in this finished state, it was
   called a graven image, i.e., a carved image, in reference to the inner
   solid figure of wood, and a molten, i.e., an overlaid or covered image,
   in reference to the outward metalline case or covering: and sometimes
   both epithets are applied to it at once, I will cut off the graven and
   molten image,' Nahum 1:14." See also Deuteronomy 7:25; Isaiah 30:22. --
   Ed.

   [66] The view given above is the one embraced by Henderson; but the
   reason given here is improbable. Newcome mentions the above, and also
   the following, "She imputed her wealth to her spiritual idolatry, and
   her conquerors shall distribute it as the reward of harlots in the
   literal sense." But inasmuch as it is said, that her rewards would be
   burnt, it is more consistent to take the last clause as a proverbial
   expression, signifying the destruction of all the wealth that was
   ascribed to idolatry as its source. "It is common," says Henry, "that
   what is squeezed out by one lust, is squandered away by another." --
   Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Micah 1:8-9

   8. Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will
   make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.

   8. Super hoc plangam et ululabo; incedam spoliatus et nudus; faciam
   planctum tanquam draconum, et luctum tanquam filiarum struthionis: [67]

   9. For her wound is incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come
   unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.

   9. Quia acerbae sunt plagae ejus (est mutatio numeri;) quia venit usque
   ad Jehudam; accessit ad portam populi mei, ad Jerusalem.


   The Prophet here assumes the character of a mourner, that he might more
   deeply impress the Israelites; for we have seen that they were almost
   insensible in their torpidity. It was therefore necessary that they
   should be brought to view the scene itself, that, seeing their
   destruction before their eyes they might be touched both with grief and
   fear. Lamentations of this kind are everywhere to be met with in the
   Prophets, and they ought to be carefully noticed; for we hence gather
   how great was the torpor of men, inasmuch as it was necessary to awaken
   them, by this form of speech, in order to convince them that they had
   to do with God: they would have otherwise continued to flatter
   themselves with delusions. Though indeed the Prophet here addresses the
   Israelites, we ought yet to apply this to ourselves; for we are not
   much unlike the ancient people: for however God may terrify us with
   dreadful threatening, we still remain quiet in our filth. It is
   therefore needful that we should be severely treated, for we are almost
   void of feeling.

   But the Prophets sometimes assumed mourning, and sometimes they were
   touched with real grief: for when they spoke of aliens and also of the
   enemies of the Church, they introduce these lamentations. When a
   mention is made of Babylon or of Egypt, they sometimes say, Behold, I
   will mourn, and my bowels shall be as a timbrel. The Prophets did not
   then really grieve; but, as I have said, they transferred to themselves
   the sorrows of others, and ever with this object, that they might
   persuade men that God's threatenings were not vain, and that God did
   not trifle with men when he declared that he was angry with them. But
   when the discourse was respecting the Church and the faithful, then the
   Prophets did not put on grief. The representation here is then to be
   taken in such a way as that we may understand that the Prophet was in
   real mourning, when he saw that a dreadful ruin was impending over the
   whole kingdom of Israel. For though they had perfidiously departed from
   the Law, they were yet a part of the holy race, they were the children
   of Abraham, whom God had received into favor. The Prophet, therefore,
   could not refrain from mourning unfeignedly for them. And the Prophet
   does here these two things, -- he shows the fraternal love which he
   entertained for the children of Israel, as they were his kindred, and a
   part of the chosen people, -- and he also discharges his own duty; for
   this lamentation was, as it were, the mirror in which he sets before
   them the vengeance of God towards men so extremely torpid. He therefore
   exhibits to them this representation, that they might perceive that God
   was by no means trifling with men, when he thus denounced punishment on
   the wicked and such as were apostates.

   Moreover, he speaks not of a common lamentation, but says, I will wail
   and howl, and then, I will go spoiled The word 'nvsh, shulal, some take
   as meaning one out of his mind or insane, as though he said, "I shall
   be now as one not possessed of a sound mind." But as this metaphor is
   rather unnatural, I prefer the sense of being spoiled; for it was the
   custom with mourners, as it is well known, to tear and to throw away
   their garments from them. I will then go spoiled and naked; and also, I
   will make wailing, not like that of men, but like the wailing of
   dragons: I will mourn, he says, as the ostriches are wont to do. In
   short, the Prophet by these forms of speech intimates, that the coming
   evil would by no means be of an ordinary kind: for if he adopted the
   usual manner of men, he could not have set forth the dreadfulness of
   God's vengeance that was impending.

   He afterwards subjoins, that the wounds vault be grievous; but he
   speaks as of what was present, Grievous, he says, are the wounds
   Grievous means properly full of grief; others render it desperate or
   incurable, but it is a meaning which suits not this place; for 'nvsh,
   anushe, means what we express in French by douloureuse. The wounds,
   then, are full of grief: for it came, (something is understood; it may
   suitably be referred to the enemy, or, what is more approved, to the
   slaughter) -- It came then, that is, the slaughter, [68] to Judah; it
   has reached to the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem itself. He says
   first, to Judah, speaking of the land; and then he confines it to the
   cities; for when the gates are closed up against enemies, they are
   forced to stop. But the Prophet says, that the cities would be no
   hindrance to the enemies to approach the very gates and even the chief
   city of Judah, that is, Jerusalem; and this, we know, was fulfilled. It
   is the same then as though he said that the whole kingdom of Israel
   would be so laid waste, that their enemies would not he content with
   victory, but would proceed farther and besiege the holy city: and this
   Sennacherib did. For after having subverted the kingdom of Israel, as
   though it was not enough to draw the ten tribes into exile, he resolved
   to take possession of the kingdom of Judah; and Jerusalem, as Isaiah
   says, was left as a tent. We hence see that the threatening of the
   Prophet Micah were not in vain. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [67] All the verbs in this verse are in the Septuagint in the third
   person, kopsetai--"she will mourn," etc. The whole is applied to
   Samaria. The Hebrew will admit of this sense, if the verbs be
   considered to be, as they may be, in Hiphil, the omission of the v is
   not uncommon. Then the rendering of the two verses will be the
   following:-- 8. I will therefore make her to moan and howl,
   I will cause her to go stripped and naked;
   I will make her to moan like the whales,
   And to wail like the ostriches: 9. For grievous will be her stroke;
   Yea it will come even to Judah,
   Reaching to the gate of my people--to Jerusalem. tgym, rendered
   "dragons" in our common version, and by Calvin, and by many others, is
   rendered "foxes" by Newcome, "wolves" by Henderson, but by Bochart,
   "whales," or those species called "dolphins;" and Professor Lee, in his
   Notes on Job 41:1, seems to be of the same opinion. The mournful groans
   of the dolphins, when taken, are said to be extremely distressing;
   their doleful moanings, too, in the night, when at liberty, have been
   testified by historians. -- vkyt ynh, "owls" in our version, is
   rendered both by Calvin and Newcome, "daughters of the ostrich," and by
   Henderson, "ostriches." The Septuagint has thugateron seirenon -- "the
   daughters of sea-monsters:" strouthokamelon -- "camel-sparrows --
   ostriches," is the rendering of Aquila and Symmachus. The literal
   expression is, "the daughters of the ostrich," meaning evidently the
   females. Dr. Shaw, as quoted by Newcome, says, "During the lonesome
   part of the night, they often make a very doleful and hideous noise. I
   have often heard them groan, as if they were in the greatest of
   agonies; an action beautifully alluded to by the Prophet Micah." -- Ed.

   [68] Or rather the stroke before mentioned; for the true reading is no
   doubt mkth, her wound or her stroke, in the singular. Though there are
   but two MSS. which have this reading, yet the previous participle noun,
   'nvsh, being singular, and the following verbs or participles being in
   the same number, favor this supposition. The corresponding word in the
   Septuagint is also in the singular number -- he plege autes, her
   stroke, stripe or scourge. -- Ed.

   Micah 1:10

   10. Declare ye it not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of
   Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.

   10. In Gath ne annuntietis, flendo ne fleatis; [69] propter domum
   Aphrah pulvere te involve (vel, voluta te in pulvere.)


   The Prophet seems here to be inconsistent with himself: for he first
   describes the calamity that was to be evident to all; but now he
   commands silence, lest the report should reach the enemies. But there
   is here nothing contradictory; for the evil itself could not be hid,
   since the whole kingdom of Israel would be desolated, the cities
   demolished or burnt, the whole country spoiled and laid waste, and then
   the enemies would enter the borders of Judah: and when Jerusalem should
   have been nearly taken how could it have been concealed? No, this could
   not have been. There is no wonder then that the Prophet had referred
   here to a solemn mourning. But he now speaks of the feeling of those
   who were desirous of hiding their own disgrace, especially from their
   enemies and aliens: for it is an indignity which greatly vexes us, when
   enemies taunt us, and upbraid us in our misfortunes; when no hope
   remains, we at least wish to perish in secret, so that no reproach and
   disgrace should accompany our death; for dishonor is often harder to be
   borne, and wounds us more grievously, than any other evil. The Prophet
   then means that the Israelites would not only be miserable, but would
   also be subject to the reproaches and taunts of their enemies. We
   indeed know that the Philistine were inveterate in their hatred to the
   people of God; and we know that they ever took occasion to upbraid them
   with their evils and calamities.

   This then is the meaning of the Prophet, when he says, In Gath declare
   it not, by weeping weep not; as though he said, "Though extreme evils
   shall come upon you, yet seek to perish in silence; for you will find
   that your enemies will gape for the opportunity to cut you with their
   taunts, when they shall see you thus miserable. He then forbids the
   people's calamities to be told in Gath; for the Philistine usually
   desired nothing more than the opportunity to torment the people of God
   with reproaches.

   It now follows, In the house of Aphrah, in dust roll thyself There is
   here an alliteration which cannot be conveyed in Latin: for phrh,
   ophre, means dusty, and phr, opher, is dust. That city attained its
   name from its situation, because the country where it was, was full of
   dust; as if a city were called Lutosa, muddy or full of clay; and
   indeed many think that Lutetia (Paris) had hence derived its name. And
   he says, Roll thyself in dust, in the house full of dust; as though he
   had said that the name would be now most suitable, for the ruin of the
   city would constrain all neighboring cities to be in mourning to cast
   themselves in the dust; So great would be the extremity of their evils.

   But we must ever bear in mind the object of the Prophet: for he here
   rouses the Israelites as it were with the sharpest goads, who
   entertained no just idea of the dreadfulness of God's vengeance, but
   were ever deaf to all threatening. The Prophet then shows that the
   execution of this vengeance which he denounced was ready at hand; and
   he himself not only mourned, but called others also to mourning. He
   speaks of the whole country, as we shall see by what follows. I shall
   quickly run over the whole of this chapter; for there is no need of
   long explanation, as you will find.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [69] Henderson renders this clause, "weep not in Acco," and mentions
   Gesenius and others, who consider that vky is put here for vkv, and Ocu
   or Acco was a town in the tribe of Asher; see Judges 1:31. The
   Septuagint favors this rendering, at least in one copy, for it has en
   akeim, though in Judges the name is Akcho. -- Ed.

   Micah 1:11

   11. Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked:
   the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Bethezel; he
   shall receive of you his standing.

   11. Transi pariter (ad verbum, transi vobis [70] habitatrix Saphir,
   nuda probrose; non egredietur habitatrix Zaanan in luctu Beth-Aezel,
   sumet a vobis stationem suam (alii vertunt, substantiam; sed male, meo
   judicio.)


   The Prophet here addresses the cities which were on the borders of the
   kingdom of Israel, and through which the enemy would pass in entering
   the kingdom of Judah. He therefore bids the inhabitants of the city
   Saphir to pass over, and says, that the city would be ashamed or in a
   shameful manner naked. The word sphyr, shaphir, means splendid. He then
   says, "Thou art now beautiful, but the Lord will discover thy shame, so
   that thy nakedness shall be a shame to all, and the greatest disgrace
   to thyself." There is a correspondence in the words, though not an
   alliteration. Hence the Prophet says, that though the city was called
   splendid, it would yet be deformed, so that no one would deign to look
   on it, at least without feeling shame. There is the same correspondence
   in the word Zaanan; for tsh, tsoe, means to transfer, as tsn, tson, is
   to migrate. Hence the Prophet says, Go forth shall not the inhabitant
   of Zaanan for the mourning of Beth-Aezel; that is, he will remain quiet
   at home: this he will do contrary to what will be natural; for whence
   is the name of the city? even from removing, for it was a place of much
   traffic. But he will remain, he says, at home: though he may see his
   neighbors dragged into exile, he will not dare to move from his place.

   He now adds, Take will the enemy from you his station. The verb md,
   omad, means to stand; nor is there a doubt but that when the Prophet
   says, He will take from you his standing, he speaks of the standing or
   station of the enemy: but interpreters however vary here. Some
   understand, that when the enemy had continued long in the land, they
   would not depart before they possessed the supreme power; as though he
   said, "Ye will think that your enemy can be wearied out with delay and
   tediousness, when not able soon to conquer your cities: this, he says,
   will not be the case; for he will resolutely persevere, and his
   expectation will not disappoint him; for he will receive the reward of
   his station, that is, of his delay." But some say, He will receive his
   station from you. They explain the verb lqch, lakech, metaphorically,
   as meaning to receive instruction from hand to hand; as though the
   Prophet had said, Some, that is, your neighbors, will learn their own
   position from you. What does this mean? Zaanan will not go forth on
   account of the mourning of its neighboring city Aezel: others will
   afterwards follow this example. How so? For Zaanan will be, as it were,
   the teacher to other cities; as it will not dare to show any sign of
   grief for its neighbors, being not able to succor them; so also, when
   it shall be taken in its turn into exile, that is, its citizens and
   inhabitants, its neighbors will remain quiet, as though the condition
   of the miserable city was no object of their care. They shall then
   learn from you their standing; that is, Ye will remain quiet and still,
   when your neighbors will be destroyed; the same thing will afterwards
   happen to you. But as this bears but little on the main subjects we may
   take either of these views. [71] It afterwards follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [70] vry lkm, pass over or migrate, as to you. One MS. Has lk, as to
   thee; but the anomaly of number is common through all the Prophets.
   "The inhabitant" here is a poetical noun of number, including the whole
   people. What usage has thus sanctioned in one language, cannot at all
   times be retained in another. We must in the present instance make
   "Inhabitant" in our language plural, or lkm, "as to you, or yea, you,"
   singular. The latter is the best mode. Then as to the peculiar form of
   lks or lk after an imperative, we have similar instances; see Genesis
   12:1; Jeremiah 5:5; Hosea 7:12. It is an emphatic mode of speaking. The
   sentence here may be thus expressed, "Pass thou over, yea, thou, O
   inhabitant of Saphir." Amaziah said to Amos, vrch lk, "Flee, yea,
   thou," etc. Or to give to l its most usual meaning, we may suppose "I
   say" to be understood; then it would be, "Flee, I say, to thee." -- Ed.

   [71] This verse is variously rendered; by Newcome thus,-- Pass on, thou
   inhabitress of Saphir, naked and in confusion.
   The inhabitants of Zanan went not forth to wailing.
   O Beth-Ezel, he shall receive of you the reward of his station against
   you. By Henderson thus,-- Pass on, thou inhabitant of Shaphir, naked
   and ashamed;
   The inhabitant of Zanan goeth not forth;
   The wailing of Beth-Ezel will take away continuance from you. It seems
   more consistent to take all the verbs in this and the preceding verse
   as imperatives, though they be not in the same person. Those in the
   second are evidently so; and I would render such as are in the third
   person as imperatives too. That Saphir, Zaanan, etc, as well as those
   which follow, are not appellatives, but proper names of places within
   or on the borders of Judah, is what is allowed by most, though not by
   all, especially by some of the ancient commentators, at least with
   regard to some of the names. I offer the following version of the tenth
   and eleventh verses, -- 10. In Gath declare ye it not, in Acco weep
   not;
   In Beth-Ophrah, roll thyself in dust: 11. Pass thou over, yea, thou, O
   inhabitant of Saphir,
   Naked and in shame;
   Let not the inhabitant of Zaanan go forth wailing;
   Let Beth-Azel take from you its position;
   that is, follow your example. The last word, mdtv, presents the
   greatest difficulty. It is found here alone in this form. It occurs as
   md, a pillar, a station, mvd, a stand, stage, and as mmd, a standing,
   and also a state, Isaiah 22:19 Buxtorf gives the same meaning to the
   last with the one in the text, constitutio, constitution, a fixed order
   of things. The verb md signifies to stand, to stand erect, to remain
   the same, either in motion or at rest, to continue. Hence it may
   rightly signify a position, a standing, that is taken and maintained.

   Micah 1:12

   12. For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil
   came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem.

   12. Quia doluit propter bonum (alii, expectavit ad bonum; alii,
   infirmata est) habitatrix Maroth; quia descendit malum a Jehova ad
   portam Jerusalem.


   The Prophet joins here another city even Maroth, and others also in the
   following verses. But in this verse he says, that Maroth would be in
   sorrow for a lost good. The verb chvl, chul, means to grieve; and it
   has this sense here; for the Marothites, that is, the inhabitants of
   that city, would have to grieve for losing their property and their
   former happy condition. But as the verb means also to expect, some
   approve of a different exposition, that is, -- that the inhabitants of
   the city Maroth would in vain depend on an empty and fallacious
   expectation, for they were doomed to utter destruction. In vain then
   will the inhabitant of Maroth expect or entertain hope; for an evil
   descends from Jehovah to the gate of the city. This view is very
   suitable, that is, that its hope will disappoint Maroth, since even the
   city of Jerusalem shall not be exempted. For though God had then by a
   miracle delivered the chief city, and its siege was raised through the
   intervention of an angel, when a dreadful slaughter, as sacred history
   records, took place; yet the city Maroth was not then able to escape
   vengeance. We now see the reason why this circumstance was added. Some
   give a harsher explanation, -- that the citizens of Maroth were to be
   debilitated, or, as it were, demented. As this metaphor is too
   strained, I embrace the other, -- that the citizens of Maroth would
   grieve for the loss of good, [72] or that they would vainly expect or
   hope, since they were already doomed to utter ruin, without any hope of
   deliverance.

   But we must notice, that evil was nigh at hand from Jehovah, for he
   reminds them, that though the whole country would be desolated by the
   Assyrians, yet God would be the chief leader, since he would employ the
   work of all those who would afflict the people of Israel. That the Jews
   then, as well as the Israelites might know, that they had to do, not
   with men only, but also with God, the celestial Judge, the Prophet
   distinctly expresses that all this would proceed from Jehovah. He
   afterwards adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [72] Grieving is the idea commonly given to the verb here used.
   "Dolebit, will grieve," Grotius, -- "Parturit, travails,"
   Marckius,--"Pineth," Henderson. Newcome, following the mere conjecture
   of Houbigant changes the original, and substitutes lmvt for ltvv, and
   gives this version, -- "is sick unto death." Not only is this wholly
   unwarranted, but it destroys the evident contrast there is in the verse
   -- the good and the evil. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Micah 1:13

   13. O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast:
   she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the
   transgressions of Israel were found in thee.

   13. Alliga currum ad camelum (vel, dromedarium; alii vertunt, equos
   celeres) habitatrix Lachis: principium sceleris ipsa est filiae Zion;
   quia in te inventae sunt transgressiones Israel.


   By bidding the citizens of Lachish to tie their chariots to dromedaries
   he intimates that it would not be not safe for them to remain in their
   city, and that nothing would be better for them than to flee elsewhere
   and to carry away their substance. "Think," he says, "of flight, and of
   the quickest flight." The word rks, recash, which I render dromedary or
   camel, is of an uncertain meaning among the Hebrews; some render it
   swift horses: but we understand the Prophet's meaning; for he intimates
   that there would be no time for flight, except they made great haste,
   for the enemies would come upon them quickly.

   And he then subjoins that that city had been the beginning of sin to
   the Jews; for though he names here the daughter of Zion, he still
   includes, by taking a part for it the whole, all the Jews. And why he
   says that Lachish had been the beginning of sin to the citizens of
   Jerusalem, we may collect from the next clauses, In thee, he says, were
   found the transgressions of Israel. The citizens of Lachish were then,
   no doubt, the first who had embraced the corruptions of Jeroboam, and
   had thus departed from the pure worship of God. When, therefore,
   contagion had entered that city, it crept, by degrees, into neighboring
   places, until at length, as we find, the whole kingdom of Judah had
   become corrupt: and this is what the Prophet repeats more fully in
   other places. It was not then without reason that he denounces
   desolation here on the citizens of Lachish; for they had been the
   authors of sin to their own kindred. However alienated the ten tribes
   had become from pure faith and pure worship, the kingdom of Judah
   remained still upright, until Lachish opened the door to ungodly
   superstitions; and then its superstitions spread through the whole of
   Judea. She therefore suffered the punishment which she deserved, when
   she was drawn away into distant exile, or, at least, when she could not
   otherwise escape from danger, than by fleeing into some fear country,
   and that very swiftly. She is the beginning, he says, of sin to the
   daughter of Zion How so? For in thee -- (it is more emphatical when the
   Prophet turns his discourse to Lachish itself) -- in thee, he says,
   were found the transgressions of Israel. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Micah 1:14

   14. Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moreshethgath: the houses of
   Achzib shall be a lie to the kings of Israel.

   14. Propterea mittes dona super Moreseth (vel, propter Moreseth-) Gath,
   filiis Achzib in mendacium regibus Israel.


   Here the Prophet alludes to another thing, -- that they would attempt
   to pacify their enemies with gifts, and would try to redeem themselves
   and their neighbors. But the Prophet expressly mentions this, that the
   event might teach them that nothing happens without a design; for it
   ought to work a greater conviction in blind and obstinate men, when
   they see that they really find that to be true which had been long
   before predicted. This, then, is the reason why the Prophet enumerates
   here various particulars; it was, that the hand of God might be more
   evident and conspicuous when he would begin, in an especial manner, to
   fulfill all the things which he now in words foretells, Thou, he says,
   wilt send a gift for Moreseth-gath; that is, for a neighboring city.
   And he calls it Moreseth-gath, to distinguish it from another city of
   the same name. Thou wilt then send gifts for Moreseth-gath, to the sons
   of Achzib for a lie 'kzyv, aczib, is a word derived from one which
   means a lie. There is, therefore, a striking alliteration, when he
   says, Thou wilt send gifts to the sons of 'kzyv, Aczib, for a lie,
   l'kzv, laaczeb; that is Thou wilt send gifts to the sons of a lie, for
   a lie. The city had obtained its name from its fallacies or guiles. And
   he says, for a lie to the kings of Israel; because it profited the
   children of Israel nothing to pacify them with gifts or to attempt to
   draw them to their side, as they hired the services of one another. So
   then he says, that they would be for a lie to the kings of Israel, for
   they would gain nothing by having many auxiliaries. Some take the words
   actively, -- that the kings of Israel had first deceived the citizens
   of Achzib: but this view is less probable; I am therefore disposed to
   adopt the other, -- that though the citizens of Lachish tried to
   conciliate their neighbors with a great sum of money, especially the
   people of Achzib, this would be yet to no purpose; for it would be a
   lie to the people of Israel: or, it may be, that the Prophet's meaning
   is this, -- that the citizens of Achzib had already wished to bring
   aid, but in vain to the kings of Israel; for Lachish was one of the
   first cities which the Assyrians conquered; but it was within the
   kingdom of Judah, or on its borders. It is then probable that the kings
   of Israel had recourse to the aid of this people, and were not
   assisted. Now, as the citizens of Lachish also endeavored to extricate
   themselves from the hand of their enemies by such aid, the prophet
   derides such a folly, inasmuch as they did not become wise by
   experience, having seen with their own eyes, that such an help had been
   useless and deceptive to the kings of Israel: they ought then to have
   tried some other means rather than to expose themselves to the same
   deceptions. [73] I cannot finish the chapter to-day.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [73] The two lines of this verse are improperly connected, and the word
   "sons" is substituted for "houses," vty, and there are no various
   readings, and the Septuagint has "houses." The literal rendering is
   this, -- Therefore thou wilt send presents to Moresheth-gath:
   The houses of Achzib will be a lie (i.e., false) to the kings of
   Israel. Henderson, after Cocceius, gives a different meaning to
   "presents," slvchym; and he renders it "divorce," and says that it
   signifies letters of repudiation, and that it is to be taken here
   metaphorically for the breaking up of connection. The word only occurs
   in two other places, that is, in Exodus 18:2, and in 1 Kings 9:16; and
   in neither does it mean what is alleged. -- Ed.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that, being warned by so many examples, the record
   of which thou hast designed to continue to the end of the world, that
   we may learn how dreadful a judge thou art to the perverse, -- O grant,
   that we may not, at this day, be deaf to thy teaching, which is
   conveyed to us by the mouth of thy Prophet, but that we may strive to
   be so reconciled to thee, that, passing by all men, we may present
   ourselves unreservedly to thee, so that, relying on thy mercy alone
   which thou hast promised to us in Christ, we may not doubt but thou
   wilt be propitious to us, and be so touched with the spirit of true
   penitence, that, if we have been to others a bad example and an
   offense, we may lead others to the right way of salvation, and each of
   us may so endeavor to assist our neighbors in a holy life, that we may
   together attain that blessed and celestial life, which thine
   only-begotten Son has procured for us by his own blood. Amen.

   Micah 1:15

   15. Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he
   shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel.

   15. Adhuc possessorem mittam, [74] tibi habitatrix Maresah; usque ad
   Adullam veniet gloria Israel.


   The Prophet here threatens his own birth place, as he had done other
   cities; for, as we have stated, he sprung from this city. He does not
   now spare his own kindred: for as God is no respecter of persons, so
   also God's servants ought, as with closed eyes, to deal impartially
   with all, so as not to be turned here and there either by favor or by
   hatred, but to follows without any change, whatever the Lord commands
   them. We see that Micah was endued with this spirit, for he reproved
   his own kindred, as he had hitherto reproved others.

   There is a peculiar meaning in the word, Mareshah, for it is derived
   from yrs, iresh, and it means possession. The Prophet now says, I will
   send to thee hvrs, euresh, a possessor; the word is from the same root.
   [75] But he means that the Morasthites would come into the power of
   their enemies no less than their neighbors, of whom he had spoken
   before. He says, to Adullam This was also a city in the tribe of Judah,
   as it is well known. But some would have "enemy" to be here understood
   and they put kvvd, cabud, in the genitive case: The enemy of the glory
   of Israel shall come to Adullam; but this is strained. Others
   understand the passage thus that the glory of Israel would come to
   disgrace; for Adullam, we know, was a cave. Since then it an obscure
   place, the Prophet here, as they think, declares that the whole glory
   of Israel would be covered with dishonor, because the dignity and
   wealth, in which they gloried would lose their pristine fixate, so that
   they would differ nothing from an ignoble cave. If any approve of this
   meaning, I will not oppose them. Yet others think that the Prophet
   speaks ironically and that the Assyrian is thus called because the
   whole glory and dignity of Israel would by him be taken away. But there
   is no need of confining this to enemies; we may then take a simpler
   view, and yet regard the expression as ironical, -- that the glory,
   that is, the disgrace or the devastation of Israel, would come to
   Adullam. But what if we read it, in apposition, He shall come to
   Adullam, the glory of Israel? For Adullam was not obscure, as those
   interpreters imagine, whom I have mentioned, but it is named among the
   most celebrated cities after the return and restoration of the people.
   When, therefore, the whole country was laid waste, this city, with a
   few others, remained, as we read in the Nehemiah 11. It might then be,
   that the Prophet called Adullam the glory of Israel; for it was
   situated in a safe place, and the inhabitants thought that they were
   fortified by a strong defense, and thus were not open to the violence
   of enemies. This meaning also may be probable; but still, as the glory
   of Israel may be taken ironically for calamity or reproach if any one
   approves more of this interpretation, it may be followed. I am,
   however, inclined to another, -- that the Prophet say, that the enemy
   would come to Adullam, which was the glory of Israel, [76] because that
   city was as it were in the recesses of Judea, so that an access to it
   by enemies was difficult. It may be also that some may think, that the
   recollection of its ancient history is here revived; for David
   concealed himself in its cave, and had it as his fortress. The place no
   doubt had, from that time, attained some fame; then this celebrity, as
   I have said, may be alluded to, when Adullam is said to be the glory of
   Israel. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [74] 'vy, there is ' left out, which is supplied in several MSS. It
   ought to be 'vy' which means, I will bring, rather than, I will send.

   [75] The instances of paranomasia or alliteration in this passage,
   including this line and the five preceding verses, are unparalleled in
   any other parts of the Prophets; and when there is no coincidence of
   sound in the words, there is sometimes a direct contrast in the ideas,
   as good and evil in verse12. -- Ed.

   [76] Of all the various renderings of this clause, this is the most
   satisfactory, which is that of our own version. The substitution of
   "honor" for "glory," on the mere authority of the Targum, as is done by
   Newcome, is wholly indefensible. Eos Odalam exei ten doxen Israel,
   Symmachus. At the same time, the most obvious and natural construction
   of the clause is the following, though its meaning is obscure; To
   Adullam shall come the glory of Israel. -- Ed.

   Micah 1:16

   16. Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge
   thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.

   16. Decalvare et tondeas te super filiis delitiarum tuarum; dilata
   calvitium sicut aquila, quoniam migrarunt abs te.


   The Prophet at length concludes that nothing remained for the people
   but lamentation; for the Lord had resolved to desolate and destroy the
   whole country. Now they were wont in mourning, as we have seen in other
   places, to shave and even tear off their hair: and some think that the
   verb qrchy, korechi, implies as much as though the Prophet said "Pluck,
   tear, pull off your hair." When afterwards he adds rgzy, regizi, they
   refer it to shavings which is done by a razor. However this may be, the
   Prophet here means that the condition of the people would be so
   calamitous that nothing would be seen anywhere but mourning.

   Make bald, he says, for the children of thy delicacies [77] The Prophet
   here indirectly upbraids those perverse men, who after so many warnings
   had not repented, with the neglect of God's forbearance: for whence did
   those delicacies proceed, except from the extreme kindness of God in
   long sparing the Israelites, notwithstanding their disobedience? The
   Prophet then shows here that they had very long abused the patience of
   God, while they each immersed themselves in their delicacies. Now, he
   says, Enlarge thy baldness as the eagle Eagles are wont to cast off
   their feathers; and hence he compares here bald men to eagles, as
   though he called them, Hairless. As then the eagles are for a certain
   time without feathers until they recover them; so also you shall be
   hairless, even on account of your mourning. He says, For they have
   migrated from thee He intimates that the Israelites would become
   exiles, that the land might remain desolate. Now follows --

   [77] Or, "children of thy indulgences or luxuries," i.e., luxurious
   children, rather than "darling children," as rendered by Henderson. The
   Septuagint has ta tekna ta truphera sou --"thy voluptuous children."
   The version of Newcome is, "thy delicate children." What seems to be
   intended is, their indulgence in pleasures and luxuries. -- Ed.

   Chapter 2
     __________________________________________________________________

   Micah 2:1

   1. Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds!
   when the morning is light, they practice it, because it is in the power
   of their hand.

   1. Vae cogitantibus iniquitatem et fabricantibus malitiam super
   cubilibus suis! Quum illuxerit mane, exequentur eam, quia est ad
   potentiam manus ipsorum.


   The Prophet does not here speak only against the Israelites, as some
   think, who have incorrectly confined this part of his teaching to the
   ten tribes; but he, on the contrary, (in discharging his office,
   addresses also the Jews. He refers not here to idolatry, as in the last
   chapter; but inveighs against sins condemned in the second table. As
   then the Jews had not only polluted the worship of God, but also gave
   loose reins to many iniquities, so that they dealt wrongfully with
   their neighbors, and there was among them no attention to justice and
   equity, so the prophet inveighs here as we shall see, against avarice,
   robberies, and cruelty: and his discourse is full of vehemence; for
   there was no doubt such licentiousness then prevailing among the
   people, that there was need of severe and sharp reproofs. It is at the
   same time easy to perceive that his discourse is mainly directed
   against the chief men, who exercised authority, and turned it to wrong
   purposes.

   Woe, he says, to those who meditate on iniquity, and devise [78] evil
   on their beds, that, when the morning shines, they may execute it Here
   the Prophet describes to the life the character and manners of those
   who were given to gain, and were intent only on raising themselves. He
   says, that in their beds they were meditating on iniquity, and devising
   wickedness. Doubtless the time of night has been given to men entirely
   for rest; but they ought also to use this kindness of God for the
   purpose of restraining themselves from what is wicked: for he who
   refreshes his strength by nightly rest, ought to think within himself,
   that it is an unbecoming thing and even monstrous, that he should in
   the meantime devise frauds, and guiles, and iniquities. For why does
   the Lord intend that we should rest, except that all evil things should
   rest also? Hence the Prophet shows here, by implication, that those who
   are intent on devising frauds, while they ought to rest, subvert as it
   were the course of nature; for they have no regard for that rest, which
   has been granted to men for this end, -- that they may not trouble and
   annoy one another.

   He afterwards shows how great was their desire to do mischief, When it
   shines in the morning, he says, they execute it He might have said
   only, They do in the daytime what they contrive in the night: but he
   says, In the morning; as though he had said, that they were so heated
   by avarice, that they rested not a moment; as soon as it shone, they
   were immediately ready to perpetrate the frauds they had thought of in
   the night. We now then apprehend the import of the Prophet's meaning.

   He now subjoins, For according to their power is their hand As 'l, al,
   means God, an old interpreter has given this rendering, Against God is
   their hand: but this does not suit the passage. Others have explained
   it thus, For strength is in their hand: and almost all those
   well-skilled in Hebrew agree in this explanation. Those who had power,
   they think, are here pointed out by the Prophet, -- that as they had
   strength, they dared to do whatever they pleased. But the Hebrew phrase
   is not translated by them; and I greatly wonder that they have mistaken
   in a thing so clear: for it is not, There is power in their hand; but
   their hand is to power. The same mode of speaking is found in Proverbs
   3, and there also many interpreters are wrong; for Solomon there
   forbids us to withhold from our neighbor his right, When thine hand, he
   says, is for power; some say, When there is power to help the
   miserable. But Solomon means no such thing; for he on the contrary
   means this, When thine hand is ready to execute any evil, abstain. So
   also the Lord says in Deuteronomy 28,

   "When the enemy shall take away thy spoils,
   thy hand will not be for power;"

   that is, "Thou wilt not dare to move a finger to restrain thy enemies;
   when they will plunder thee and rob thee of thy substance, thou wilt
   stand in dread, for thy hand will be as though it were dead." I come
   now to the present passage, Their hand is for power: [79] the Prophet
   means, that they dared to try what they could, and that therefore their
   hand was always ready; whenever there was hope of lucre or gains the
   hand was immediately prepared. How so? Because they were restrained
   neither by the fear of God nor by any regard for justice; but their
   hand was for power, that is, what they could, they dared to do. We now
   then see what the Prophet means as far as I can judge. He afterwards
   adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [78] Literally, work; but phl means to work not only with the hands,
   but also with the mind; and hence, to contrive, to devise, to
   machinate. Henderson has "fabricate," while Newcome, less suitably,
   retains the word, "work." Marckius justly observes, that the working
   here is not external but internal, the framing, the setting in order,
   the preparation of evil in the mind. The Prophet points out here that
   source from which outward evils proceed. What numberless schemes, both
   good and evil, are concocted and arranged by men on their beds! "They
   set their wits on work to invent ways of accomplishing their desire.
   They devise iniquity with a great deal of cursed art and policy; they
   plot how to do it effectually, and yet so as not to expose themselves.
   This is called working evil; they are working it in their heads." --
   Henry.

   [79] The original is, ky ys-l'l ydm Marckius after having referred to
   Calvin's version, says, that he prefers that of Junius and Tremelius
   which is as follows: "Quum est in potestate manus ipsoram -- When it is
   in the power of their hand," ky is taken as an adverb of time. The
   phrase is found in four other places, -- Genesis 31:29; Deuteronomy
   28:32; Nehemiah 5:5; and Proverbs 3:27. So that to render 'l here
   "God," as it is done by the Septuagint, Theodoret, and Jerome, and some
   others, must be wrong. ky is rendered "because" both by Newcome and
   Henderson, but not so suitably as to the sense. -- Ed.

   Micah 2:2

   2. And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and
   take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his
   heritage.

   2. Et concupiverunt agros et rapiunt; et domos, et auferunt; et vexant
   virum et domum ejus, virum et haereditatem ejus.


   Micah confirms here what is contained in the former verse; for he sets
   forth the alacrity with which the avaricious were led to commit
   plunder; nay, how unbridled was their cupidity to do evil. As soon as
   they have coveted any thing, he says, they take it by force. And hence
   we gather, that the Prophet, in the last verse, connected wicked
   counsels with the attempt of effecting them; as though he had said,
   that they indeed carefully contrived their frauds, but that as they
   were skillful in their contrivances, so they were not less bold and
   daring in executing then.

   The same thing he now repeats in other words for a further
   confirmation, As soon as they have coveted fields, they seize them by
   force; as soon as they have coveted houses they take them away; they
   oppress a man and his house together; [80] that is, nothing escaped
   them: for as their wickedness in frauds was great, so their disposition
   to attempt whatever they wished was furious. And well would it be were
   there no such cruel avarice at this day; but it exists every where, so
   that we may see, as in a mirror, an example of what is here said. But
   it behaves us carefully to consider how greatly displeasing to God are
   frauds and plunders, so that each of us may keep himself from doing any
   wrong, and be so ruled by a desire of what is right, that every one of
   us may act in good faith towards his neighbors, seek nothing that is
   unjust, and bridle his own desires: and whenever Satan attempts to
   allure us, let what is here taught be to us as a bridle to restrain us.
   It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [80] This verse presents an instance of parallelism not uncommon, in
   which the first and the last line correspond, and the second and the
   third; as will be seen in the following version: -- And they covet
   fields and forcibly seize them,
   And houses, and they take them away;
   Yea, they oppress the young man and his house,
   And the old man and his inheritance. There must be some distinction
   between gvr, which I render, "the young man," and 'ys, rendered above,
   "the old man." The first means, robust, strong; and the second is a
   common term for man, but sometimes signifies a husband, and also a man
   in years. We may, indeed in harmony with the passage, consider the
   first as meaning a householder, and the latter as signifying a
   husbandman. The fields in the first line are the same with the
   inheritance in the last: and houses and a house are mentioned in the
   two intervening lines. -- Ed.

   Micah 2:3

   3. Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, against this family do I
   devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither
   shall ye go haughtily: for this time is evil.

   3. Propterea sic dicit Jehova, Ecce ego cogitans super familiam hanc
   malum, quod non submovebitis ab illo (sic est ab verbum; a quo
   submovebitis) colla vestra, et non ambulabitis in altitudine; quia
   tempus malum hoc.


   The Prophet shows now that the avaricious were in vain elevated by
   their frauds and rapacity, because their hope would be disappointed;
   for God in heaven was waiting his time to appear against them. Though
   they had anxiously heaped together much wealth, yet God would justly
   dissipate it altogether. This is what he now declares.

   Behold, he says, thus saith Jehovah, I am meditating evil against this
   family [81] There is here a striking contrast between God and the Jews,
   between their wicked intentions and the intentions of God, which in
   themselves were not evil, and yet would bring evil on them. God, he
   says, thus speaks, Behold, I am purposing; as though he said, "While ye
   are thus busying yourselves on your beds, while ye are revolving many
   designs while ye are contriving many artifices, ye think me to be
   asleep, ye think that I am all the while meditating nothing; nay, I
   have my thoughts too, and those different from yours; for while ye are
   awake to devise wickedness I am awake to contrive judgment." We now
   then perceive the import of these words: it is God that declares that
   he meditates evil, and it is not the Prophet that speaks to these
   avaricious and rapacious men; and the evil is that of punishment,
   inasmuch as it is the peculiar office of God to repay to all what they
   deserve, and to render to each the measure of evil they have brought on
   others.

   Ye shall not, he says, remove your necks from under it. Since
   hypocrites always promise to themselves impunity, and lay hold on
   subterfuges, whenever God threatens them, the Prophet here affirms,
   that though they sought every escape, they would yet be held bound by
   God's hand, so that they could not by any means shake off the burden
   designed for them. And this was a reward most fully deserved by those
   who had withdrawn their necks when God called them to obedience. They
   then who refuse to obey God, when he requires from them a voluntary
   service, will at length be drawn by force, not to undergo the yoke, but
   the burden which will altogether overwhelm them. Whosoever then will
   not willingly submit to God's yoke, must at length undergo the great
   and dreadful burden prepared for the unnamable.

   Ye will not then be able to withdraw your necks, and ye shall not walk
   in your height. He expresses still more clearly what I have referred
   to, -- that they were so elated with pride, that they despised all
   threatening and all instruction: and this presumption became the cause
   of perverseness; for were it not that a notion of security deceived
   men, they would presently bend, when God threatens them. This then is
   the reason why the Prophet joins this sentence, ye shall no more walk
   in your height; that is, your haughtiness shall then surely be made to
   succumb; for it will be a time of evil He means, as I have said, that
   those who retain a stir and unbending neck towards God, when he would
   lay on them his yoke, shall at length be made by force to yield,
   however rebellious they may be. How so? For they shall be broken down,
   inasmuch as they will not be corrected. The Prophet then adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [81] The word msphchh, family, no doubt designates the people of
   Israel, so called, either for their descent from the same father, or
   for their adoption by God as his people, designed to live in subjection
   to him as a family to its head. -- Ed.

   Micah 2:4

   4. In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and lament with
   a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed
   the portion of my people: how hath he removed it from me! turning away
   he hath divided our fields.

   4. In die illo tollent super eos parabolam, et lugebunt (sunt quidem
   verba singularis numeri, ys' et nhh; caeterum indefinita est locutio;
   nam qui subau diunt conductios homines, quibus solebat injungi haec
   provincia, ut lugubres cantus conciperent ad cladem aliquam, nescio an
   assecuti sint mentem Prophetae: tamen hoc relinquo in medio, quia alibi
   vidimus fuisse tunc cantores in luctu, quemadmodum etiam alibi erunt
   Praeficae, hoc est, mulieres lamentatrices; caeterum malo indefinite
   accipere; Tollent igitur super vos parabolam et lugebunt) luctu
   lamentabili (vel, lamento lamenti,) dicendo, Vastando vastati sumus;
   partem populi mei mutavit; quomodo tollent a nobis ad restituendum?
   Agros nostros dividet.


   The verse is in broken sentences; and hence interpreters vary. But the
   meaning of the Prophet appears to me to be simply this, In that day
   they shall take up a proverb against you; that is, it will not be an
   ordinary calamity, but the report concerning it will go forth every
   where so that the Jews will become to all a common proverb. This is one
   thing. As to the word msl, meshil, it is taken, we know, for a weighty
   saying, and in the plural, weighty sayings, called by the Latins,
   sentences (sententias) or sayings, (dicta,) and by the Greeks,
   apophthegmata. apophthegmata, But these sayings were thus called
   weighty by the Hebrews, because he who elevated his style, made use
   especially of figurative expressions, to render his discourse nobler
   and more splendid. [82] Hence many render this word, enigmas. It
   accords well with the Prophet's meaning, to suppose, that proverbial
   sayings would spread every where respecting the Jews, especially as
   calamities were usually described in a plaintive song. They shall then
   mourn over you with lamentable mourning. But this ought to be referred
   to the fact, -- that the calamity would be every where known. It yet
   seems that this sentence is applied afterwards to the Jews themselves,
   and not unsuitably. But it is an indefinite mode of speaking, since the
   Prophet speaks not of one or two men, but of the whole people.

   They shall then mourn in this manner, Wasted, we have been wasted: the
   portion of my people has he changed -- (it is the future instead of the
   past) -- He has then changed the portion of my people This may be
   applied to God as well as to the Assyrians; for God was the principal
   author of this calamity; he it was who changed the portion of the
   people: for as by his blessing he had long cherished that people, so
   afterwards he changed their lot. But as the Assyrians were the
   ministers of God's vengeance, the expression cannot be unsuitably
   applied to them. The Assyrian then has taken away the portion of my
   people And then he says, How has he made to depart, or has taken away,
   or removed from me, (literally, to me,) to restore, -- though svv,
   shibeb, may be from the root svv, shub, it yet means the same, -- How
   then has he taken away from us to restore our fields he divides, that
   is, which he has divided; for the relative 'sr, asher, is understood
   and there is also a change of time. Now as the discourse, as I have
   said, is in broken sentences, there are various interpretations. I
   however think that the Prophet simply means this -- How as to restoring
   has he taken away our fields, which he hath divided? that is, How far
   off are we from restitution? for every hope is far removed, since the
   Lord himself has divided among strangers our land and possession; or
   since the enemies have divided it among themselves; for it is usual
   after victory, for every one to seize on his own portion. Whether then
   this be understood of the Assyrians, or rather be referred to God, the
   meaning of the Prophet seems clearly to be this, -- that the Jews were
   not only expelled from their country but that every hope of return was
   also taken away, since the enemies had parted among themselves their
   inheritance, so that they who had been driven out, now in vain thought
   of a restitution. [83] But I read this in the present time; for the
   Prophet introduces here the Jews as uttering this lamentation, -- "It
   is now all over with us, and there is no remedy for this evil; for not
   only are we stripped of all our property and ejected from our country,
   but what has been taken away by our enemies cannot be restored to us,
   inasmuch as they have already parted our possessions among themselves,
   and every one occupies his own portion and his own place, as though it
   were his own inheritance. We have therefore to do, not only with the
   Assyrians in general, but also with every individual; for what every
   one now occupies and possesses he will defend, as his rightful and
   hereditary possession."

   Some conjecture from this verse, that the discourse belongs rather to
   the Israelites, who were banished without any hope of return; but no
   necessity constrains us to explain this of the Israelites; for the
   Prophet does not declare here what God would do, but what would be the
   calamity when considered in itself. We have indeed said already in many
   places, that the Prophets, while threatening, speak only of calamities,
   desolations, deaths, and destructions, but that they afterwards add
   promises for consolation. But their teaching is discriminative: when
   the Prophets intend to terrify hypocrites and perverse men, they set
   forth the wrath of God only, and leave no hope; but when they would
   inspire with hope those who are by this means humbled, they draw forth
   comfort to them even from the goodness of God. What is here said then
   may fitly and really be applied to the Jews. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [82] Very similar is the description of msl by Lowth in his
   Praelections; he describes it as that style which is sententius,
   figurative, and sublime -- Sententiosum, figuratum, et sublime docendi
   genus He says also that the word means often a saying, anaxiom, a short
   sentence compactly formed -- est quoevis sententia sive axioma scite
   graviterque dictum, paucis concinnatum, et ad gnomon firmam compositum,
   1 Samuel 24:14, Prael. 4. And this is evidently its meaning here, -- a
   common saying, everywhere known. -- Ed.

   [83] Most commentators agree as to the general meaning of this verse,
   which is clearly stated here: but their versions differ. Newcome,
   following the Septuagint, renders the verbs in the first and second
   lines in a passive sense, but Henderson gives them an active meaning,
   supplying "one" as the nominative case, i.e., the person, who utters
   the lamentation afterwards mentioned. The two last lines are the most
   difficult. Marckius has this version, -- Quomodo subtraxit mihi!
   Avertenti agros nostros distribuit! That of Junius and Tremelius is
   essentially the same, only the verbs are put in the present tense.
   Newcome's rendering is this, -- How hath he withdrawn it form me!
   To an apostate he hath divided our fields! To call the king of Babylon
   an apostate, seems incongruous, as it cannot be applied to any one but
   who has turned away from true religion. The most obvious and literal
   rendering is that given by Marckius, with the exception of the tense. I
   offer the following version of the whole verse, with no alteration in
   the text, except the supplying of a v before 'mr which is found in
   several MSS., -- In that day shall be taken up concerning you a
   proverb,
   And lament a lamentation will the oppressed,
   And say will the desolate, -- "We are destroyed,
   The portion of my people he changes;
   How he takes away from me!
   To the alienator of my fields he divides them! It is a proverb, a
   common saying, and a lament, that would be uttered, as the Prophet
   foretells, at the time of the expulsion of the people from the land,
   when it would be taken possession of by their enemies. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Micah 2:5

   5. Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the
   congregation of the LORD.

   5. Itaque non erit tibi projiciens funiculum ad sortem in coetu
   Jehovae.


   Here the Prophet concludes his discourse respecting God's design to
   cleanse Judea from its perverse and wicked inhabitants, that it might
   no longer be the inheritance of one people. For the land, we know, had
   been given to the posterity of Abraham, on the condition, that it was
   to be held by them as an heritage: and we also know, that a line was
   determined by lot whenever the year of Jubilee returned, that every one
   might regain his own possession. The Prophet now testifies that this
   advantage would be taken away from the Jews, and that they would
   hereafter possess the land by no hereditary right; for God, who had
   given it, would now take it away.

   There shall not then be one to cast a line by lot in the assembly of
   Jehovah. And he seems here to touch the Jews, by calling them the
   assembly of Jehovah. He indeed adopted them, they were the people of
   God: but he intimates that they were repudiated, because they had
   rendered themselves unworthy of his favor. He therefore, by calling
   them ironically the assembly of Jehovah, denies that they rightly
   retained this name, inasmuch as they had deprived themselves of this
   honor and dignity. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Micah 2:6

   6. Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy: they shall not
   prophesy to them, that they shall not take shame.

   6. Ne stilletis; stillabunt; non stillabunt illis (hoc est, super eos;)
   non apprehendet ignominias (sic est ad verbum.)


   Here the conciseness of the expressions has made interpreters to differ
   in their views. Some read thus, Distill ye not, -- they will distill;
   that is, the Jews speak against the prophets, and with threats forbid
   them, as with authority, to address them. The Hebrew word, distill,
   means the same as to speak; though at the same time it is applied more
   commonly to weighty addresses than to such as are common and ordinary.
   If any understands, they will distill, or speak, of the Jews, then the
   Prophet points out their arrogance in daring to contend with God's
   prophets, and in trying to silence and force them to submission. We
   indeed find that ungodly men act thus, when they wish to take away the
   liberty of teaching from God's prophets; for they resist as though they
   themselves were doubly and treble prophets. So also in this place,
   Distill ye not, that is, the Jews say, Let not the servants of God
   prophesy. But some think that a relative is understood, Distill ye not
   for them who distill; as though he had said, that ungodly men would not
   bear God's prophets and thus would prevent and restrain them, as much
   as they could, from speaking. Others make this distinction, Distill ye
   not, -- they shall distill; as though the Jews said the first, and God
   the second. Distill ye not, -- this was the voice of the ungodly and
   rebellious people, who would cast away from them and reject every
   instruction: but God on the other side opposed them and said, Nay, they
   shall distill; ye forbid, but it is not in your power; I have sent
   them: though ye may rage and glamour a hundred times, it is my will
   that they should proceed in their course.

   We hence see how various are the explanations: and even in the other
   part of the verse there is no more agreement between interpreters: They
   shall not distill; respecting this clause, it is sufficiently evident,
   that God here intimates that there would be now an end to all
   prophecies. How so? Because he would not render his servants a sport,
   and subject them to reproach. This is the true meaning: and yet some
   take another view, as though the Prophet continued his sentence, They
   shall not distill, lest the people should receive reproaches; for the
   ungodly think, that if they close the mouths of the prophets, all
   things would be lawful to them, and that their crimes would be hid, in
   short, that their vices would not be called to an account; as though
   their wickedness was not in itself sufficiently reproachful, were God
   to send no prophets, and no reproof given. No doubt, profane men are so
   stupid as to think themselves free from every reproach, when God is
   silent, and when they put away from themselves every instruction. Hence
   some think, that this passage is to be understood in this sense. But I
   consider the meaning to be that which I have stated; for he had before
   said, Distill ye not who distill; that is, Ye prophets, be no longer
   troublesome to us; why do you stem our ears? We can no longer bear your
   boldness; be then silent. Thus he expressly introduced the Jews as
   speaking with authority, as though it was in their power to restrain
   the prophets from doing their duty. Now follows, as I think, the answer
   of God, They shall not distill, that he may not get reproaches: Since I
   see that my doctrine is intolerable to you, since I find a loathing so
   great and so shameful, I will take away my prophets from you: I will
   therefore rest, and be hereafter silent. -- Why? "Because I effect
   nothing; nay, I subject my prophets to reproaches; for they lose their
   labor in speaking, they pour forth words which produce no fruit; for ye
   are altogether irreclaimable. Nay, as they are reproachfully treated by
   you, their condition is worse than if they were covered with all the
   disgrace of having been criminal. Since then I subject my prophets to
   reproach I will not allow them to be thus mocked by you. They shall
   therefore give over, they shall prophesy no longer. [84] "

   But the Lord could not have threatened the Jews with any thing worse or
   more dreadful than with this immunity, -- that they should no more hear
   anything which might disturb them: for it is an extreme curse, when God
   gives us loose reins, and suffers us, with unbridled liberty, to rush
   as it were headlong into evils, as though he had delivered us up to
   Satan to be his slaves. Since it is so, let us be assured that it is an
   awful threatening, when he says, They shall not distill, lest they
   should hereafter become objects of reproach.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [84] Newcome, apparently on the authority of the Septuagint, joins a
   part of the last verse to this, and gives this rendering,-- In the
   congregation of Jehovah prophesy not, O ye that prophesy:
   They shall not prophesy to these:
   For he shall remove from himself reproaches. The last line he applies
   to the true prophet, that he would not subject himself to disgrace by
   exercising his office. Henderson's version is the following: --
   Prophesy not; those shall prophesy
   Who will not prophesy of these things:
   Reproaches are incessant. This is viewed as being altogether the
   language of the people, interdicting the true prophets, specifying
   those whom they approved, and deprecating the reproaches cast upon them
   by the true prophets. Another version, which is materially adopted by
   Calvin, is admitted by our Author as not unsuitable, but he prefers the
   one given above. The main objection is to the last line, which in the
   original is this, -- l' yg klmvt The last word is plural, and means
   reproaches; and the verb ysg is in the third person of the future
   tense, and may be derived either from svg, to recede, to depart, or
   from gsg, to remove, both in a transitive and intransitive sense.
   Having an objective case, it cannot be the first verb, and must be the
   second in its transitive meaning. Then the rendering is, He will not,
   or let him not, or let none remove reproaches. This being the literal
   rendering of this sentence, we must now consider what version of the
   former part will correspond best with it. It is that no doubt adopted
   by Calvin, though the last clause cannot admit of the meaning he
   attaches to it. The people say, "Prophesy ye not who prophesy;" God
   answers, "They shall not prophesy to these;" and then the Prophet adds,
   speaking of God, "He will not remove reproaches;" that is, he will not
   remove them by his prophets with the view of amending their reproachful
   conduct. The last clause is evidently viewed as an anomalous
   construction by Henderson; for he renders it as though the plural noun
   were the nominative case to the verb in the singular number, and this
   because the latter precedes the former. There may be instances of this
   in Hebrew, but it is by no means a common usage; though it be so in the
   Welsh language, which in so many of its peculiarities is very much like
   Hebrew. This sort of construction is the ordinary one in that language:
   a plural noun has commonly a verb in the singular number, when placed
   before it. This sentence in Welsh would be exactly the same as in
   Hebrew--Nid ymadawa gwaradwyddiadau The noun in the plural number is
   the nominative case to the preceding verb, which is in the singular
   number, and the verb too is in the future tense, and is yet understood
   as having the meaning of the present tense. -- Ed.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou art pleased to try our patience by
   requiring mutual justice and the offices of love and benevolence, -- O
   grant, that we may not be wolves one to another, but show ourselves to
   be really thy children, by observing all those duties of justice and
   kindness which thou commandest, and thus follow what is right and just
   through the whole course of our life, that we may at length enjoy that
   blessedness which is laid up for us in heaven, through Christ our Lord.
   Amen.

   Micah 2:7

   7. O thou that art named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the Lord
   straitened? are these his doings? do not my words do good to him that
   walketh uprightly?

   7. Qui diceris domus Jacob, an reductus est in angustias Spiritus
   Jehova? (alii vertunt, an imminutus est Spiritus Jehovae; qtsr
   significat coarctare, significat etiam imminuere apud Hebraeos; sed
   melius quadrat sensus ille quem reddidi.) An haec sunt opera ejus?
   Annon verba mea bona sunt cum eo (hoc est, apud cum) qui rectus
   ambulat?


   The Prophet now reproves the Israelites with greater severity, because
   they attempted to impose a law on God and on his prophets and would not
   endure the free course of instruction. He told us in the last verse,
   that the Israelites were inflated with so much presumption, that they
   wished to make terms with God: "Let him not prophesy" they said, as
   though it were in the power of man to rule God: and the Prophet now
   repeats, Is the Spirit of Jehovah straitened? as though he said, Ye see
   the intent of your presumption, and how far it proceeds; for ye wish to
   subject God's Spirit to yourselves and to your own pleasure. The
   prophets doubtless did not speak of themselves, but by the bidding and
   command of God. Since then the prophets were the organs of the Holy
   Spirit, whosoever attempted to silence them, usurped to himself an
   authority over God himself, and in a manner tried to make captive his
   Spirit: for what power can belong to the Spirit, except he be at
   liberty to reprove the vices of men, and condemn whatever is opposed to
   God's justice? When this is taken away, there is no more any
   jurisdiction left to the Holy Spirit. We now then see what the Prophet
   means in this place: he shows how mad a presumption it was in the
   Israelites to attempt to impose silence on the prophets, as though they
   had a right to rule the Spirit of God, and to force him to submission.

   Is the Spirit of Jehovah straitened? And this mode of speaking ought to
   be noticed, for it possesses no ordinary emphasis; inasmuch as the
   Prophets by this reproof; recalls the attention of these perverse men
   to the author of his teaching; as though he had said, that the wrong
   was not done to men, that war was not carried on with them, when
   instruction is prohibited, but that God is robbed of his own rights and
   that his liberty is taken away, so that he is not allowed to execute
   his judgment in the world by the power of his Spirit.

   And farther, the Prophet here ironically reproves the Israelites, when
   he says, O thou who art called the house of Jacob, is the Spirit of
   Jehovah reduced to straits? For if heathens, who have never known the
   teaching of religion, and to whom no heavenly mysteries have been
   revealed, had said, that they would have nothing to do with the
   prophets, it would have been much more endurable; for what wonder would
   it be for ignorant men to repudiate all instruction? But it was
   monstrous for the Israelites, who gloried in the name of God, to dare
   to rise up so rebelliously against the prophets: they always boasted of
   their own race, as though they surpassed all the rest of the world, and
   were a holy nations separated from all others. Hence the Prophet says,
   "Ye wish to be called the house of Jacob; what is your excellency and
   dignity, except that you have been chosen by God to be his peculiar
   people? If then you have been habituated to the teaching of God, what
   fury and madness it is, that you cannot bear his prophets, but wish to
   close their mouths?" We now then see the point of this irony, when the
   Prophet says that they were called the house of Jacob He seems at the
   same time to intimate, in an indirect way, that they were a spurious
   race. As they were called by other prophets, Amorites and Sodomites:
   even so in this place the Prophet says, "Ye are indeed the house of
   Jacob, but it is only as to the name." They were in reality so
   degenerated, that they falsely pretended the name of the holy
   patriarch; yea, they falsely and mendaciously boasted of their descent
   from holy men, though they were nothing else but as it were rotten
   members. Inasmuch then as they had so departed from the religion of
   Abraham and of other fathers, the Prophet says, "Thou art indeed called
   what thou art not."

   He afterwards adds, Are these his works? Here he brings the Israelites
   to the proof, as though he said, How comes it, that the prophets are so
   troublesome and grievous to you, except that they sharply reprove you,
   and denounce on you the judgment of God? But God is in a manner forced,
   except he was to change his nature, to treat you thus sharply and
   severely. Ye boast that you are his people, but how do you live? Are
   these his works? that is, do you lead a life, and form your conduct
   according to the law laid down by him? But as your life does not in any
   degree correspond with what God requires, it is no wonder that the
   prophets handle you so roughly. For God remains the same, ever like
   himself; but ye are perfidious, and have wholly repudiated the covenant
   he has made with you. Then this asperity, of which ye are wont to
   complain, ought not to be deemed unjust to you.

   He then subjoins, Are not my words good to him who walks uprightly?
   Here the Prophet more distinctly shows, why he had before asked,
   Whether their works were those of the Lord; for he compares their life
   with the doctrine, which on account of its severity displeased them;
   they said that the words of the prophets were too rigid. God here
   answers, that his words were gentle and kind, and therefore pleasant,
   that is, to the pious and good; and that hence the fault was in them,
   when he treated them less kindly than they wished. The import of the
   whole then is, that the word of God, as it brings life and salvation to
   man, is in its own nature gracious, and cannot be either bitter, or
   hard, or grievous to the pious and the good, for God unfolds in it the
   riches of his goodness.

   We hence see that God here repudiates the impious calumny that was cast
   on his word; as though he had said, that the complaints which prevailed
   among the people were false; for they transferred the blame of their
   own wickedness to the word of God. They said that God was too severe:
   but God here declares that he was gentle and kind, and that the
   character of his word was the same, provided men were tractable, and
   did not, through their perverseness, extort from him anything else than
   what he of himself wished. And the same thing David means in Psalm 18,
   when he says that God is perverse with the perverse: for in that
   passage he intimates, that he had experienced the greatest goodness
   from God, inasmuch as he had rendered himself docile and obedient to
   him. On the contrary, he says, God is perverse with the perverse; that
   is, when he sees men obstinately resisting and hardening their necks,
   he then puts on as it were a new character, and deals perversely with
   them, that is, severely, as their stubbornness deserves; as for a hard
   knot, according to a common proverb, a hard wedge is necessary. We now
   then perceive the meaning of this passage, that God's words are good to
   those who walk uprightly; that is they breathe the sweetest odour, and
   bring nothing else but true and real joy: for when can there be
   complete happiness, except when God embraces us in the bosom of his
   love? But the testimony respecting this love is brought to us by his
   word. The fault then is in us, and ought to be imputed to us, if the
   word of God is not delightful to us.

   Some expound this whole passage differently, as though the Prophet
   relates here what was usually at that time the boast of the Israelites.
   They hence think that it is a narrative in which he represents their
   sentiments; (narrationem esse mimiticam;) as though the Prophet
   introduced here the ungodly and the rebellious animating one another in
   their contempt of God's word, O thou who art called the house of Jacob,
   is the Spirit of Jehovah straitened? Hypocrites, we know, are so blind
   and intoxicated by a false confidence, that they hesitate not
   heedlessly to abuse all the favors of God. As then God had conferred a
   great excellency on his people, they thus emboldened one another, --
   "Are we not the children and posterity of Abraham? What will it avail
   us to be a holy and chosen race, and the peculiar people of God, and a
   royal priesthood, if we are to be thus unkindly treated? We find that
   these prophets shamefully reprove us: where is our dignity, except we
   show that we have more privileges than other nations?" These
   interpreters therefore think the meaning to be this, -- that they make
   a show of their own privileges, that they might with more liberty
   reject every instruction, and shake off every yoke. And when it is
   said, Is the Spirit of God diminished? these interpreters regard this
   as meaning, that they were satisfied with the solemn promise of God,
   and that as they were a holy race, they now superciliously despised all
   the prophets, -- "Is the Spirit of God dead, who was formerly the
   interpreter of the everlasting covenant, which God made with us? Has he
   not testified that we should be to him a holy and elect people? Why
   then do ye now attempt to reduce to nothing this sacred declaration of
   the Holy Spirit, which is inviolable?" It is then added, Are these his
   works? "Ye talk of nothing but of threats and destruction; ye denounce
   on us numberless calamities: but God is beneficent and kind in his
   nature, patient and merciful; and ye represent him to us as a tyrant;
   but this view is wholly inconsistent with the nature of God." And, in
   the last place, God subjoins, as these interpreters think, an
   exception, -- "All these are indeed true, if faithfulness exists among
   you, and the authority of my word continues; for my words are good, but
   not to all without any difference: be upright and sincere, and ye shall
   find me dealing kindly, gently, tenderly, and pleasantly with you: then
   my rigor will cease, which now through my word so much offends and
   exasperates you."

   This meaning may in some measure be admitted; but as it is hard to be
   understood, we ought to retain the former, it being more easy and
   flowing. There is nothing strained in the view, that the Prophet
   derides the foolish arrogance of the people, who thought that they were
   sheltered by this privilege, that they were the holy seed of Abraham.
   The Prophet answers that this titular superiority did not deprive God
   of his right, and prevent him to exercise his power by the Spirit. "O
   thou then who art called the house of Jacob; but only as far as the
   title goes: the Spirit of God is not reduced to straits. But if thou
   boastest thyself to be the peculiar people of God, are these thy works
   the works of God? Does thy life correspond with what he requires? There
   is no wonder then that God chastises you so severely by his word, for
   there is not in you the spirit of docility, which allows the exercise
   of his kindness." [85]

   But though the Prophet here upbraids the ancient people with
   ingratitude, yet this truth is especially useful to us, which God
   declares, when he says that his word is good and sweet to all the
   godly. Let us then learn to become submissive to God, and then he will
   convey to us by his word nothing but sweetness, nothing but delights;
   we shall then find nothing more desirable than to be fed by this
   spiritual food; and it will ever be a real joy to us, whenever the Lord
   will open his mouth to teach us. But when at any time the word of the
   Lord goads and wounds, and thus exasperates us, let us know that it is
   through our own fault. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [85] Newcome, adopting h'mr, as found in four MSS., renders the first
   part of the verse as the language of the people, though not in the
   sense of those referred to by Calvin. His version is as follows: --
   Doth the house of Israel [Jacob] say,
   "Is the Spirit of Jehovah straightened?
   Are these his doings?" "Straightened," i.e., confined to a few, such as
   Micah. And by "doings," he means the judgments before announced.
   Henderson regards the "doings," or, as he renders them, "operations,"
   in the same light, though he views the words as spoken by the Prophet,
   and renders the first line thus, -- What language, O house of Jacob!
   The first word, h'mvr, as it is in our text, is viewed by Henderson, as
   well as by Marckius, as a passive participle, signifying what is said
   or spoken, and the h prefixed is considered as a note of exclamation.
   But the objection made to our common version is not valid, that 'mr in
   Niphael, when it means being called or named, has uniformly an l after
   it, for we have an instance to the contrary in Jeremiah 7:32, vd htphch
   vl'-y'mr, "and it shall no more be called Tophet." -- Ed.

   Micah 2:8

   8. Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe
   with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from
   war.

   8. Et qui antehac populus meus, quasi in hostem surrexit ex adverso;
   vestem decoris (alii vertunt, pallium et tunicam; sed nulla est copula,
   et 'dr significat decorem, ideo possumus vertere vestem decoris)
   praedati estis a transeuntibus cum fiducia, perinde ac si reverterentur
   a praelio.


   As the words of the Prophet are concise, they contain some obscurity.
   Hence interpreters differ. First, as to the word 'tmyl, atmul, some
   think it to be one word, others divide it into 't, at and mvl, mul,
   which means, over against, opposite; and they regard it of the same
   import with mmvl, which immediately follows. But as the repetition
   would be frigid, the Prophet no doubt intended that it should be taken
   here in its proper sense, and its meaning is yesterday. But this time
   is not strictly taken by the Hebrews, for they take yesterday as
   meaning the past time, even when many years have elapsed. I have
   therefore rendered it formerly, which suits this place. There is also
   another difference as to the sense of the text, for some think that
   this 'tmvl, atmul, is to be joined to the verb qvmm, kumum; but it is
   rather to be connected with the word my, omi, My people formerly There
   is another diversity, that is, as to the term 'vyv, avib, for some
   apply it to God, and others to the people; that they rose up or stood
   one against another. For this verb is explained in two ways: some view
   it as a verb neuter, They stand against the enemy; and others render
   it, They rise up against the enemy; and this second meaning is most
   approved, and harmonizes best with the context.

   I will now refer to what I consider to be the real meaning. The
   Prophet, in the first place, says, that the people were formerly under
   the power and government of God, but that now they were become wholly
   alienated from him. Formerly, then, it was my people, as though God now
   renounced all friendship with them. "I have hitherto owned you as my
   people, but hereafter I shall have nothing to do with you, for the
   whole authority of my word is by you entirely abolished; ye have
   violated your faith: in short, as you have destroyed my covenant, ye
   have ceased to be my people; for whatever favor I have conferred on
   you, you have deprived yourselves of it by your wickedness; and though
   I have adopted you, yet your wickedness now strips you of this
   privilege." This is one thing.

   It then follows, They have risen up as against an enemy. I consider a
   note of likeness to be here understood. The Prophet says simply,
   Against an enemy have they risen up; but I regard the meaning to be,
   that they had risen up as against an enemy; that is that they had made
   God, their best father, their enemy, inasmuch as they had by their
   crimes provoked his displeasure. [86] He then confirms this truth by
   saying, that they practiced robberies among themselves. We indeed know
   that hypocrites ever hide themselves under their religious rites, and
   spread them forth as their shield whenever they are reproved. Hence the
   Prophet says, that they were not to be deemed the people of God for
   spending their labors on sacrifices, for they were at the same time
   robbers, and plundered innocent men.

   The garment of comeliness, he says, or, the garment and the cloak,
   (about such words I do not labor much,) they take away from those who
   pass by securely; [87] that is from all who are peaceable. For when
   there is a suspicion of war, or when a traveler does any mischief, he
   rightly deserves to be punished. But the Prophet says here, that they
   were robbed, who passed by securely as though they were in a safe
   country. "When travelers fear nothing, ye strip them of their garments,
   as though they were returning from war: as they are wont, when war is
   over, to seize on spoils wherever found, and no one can keep his own;
   so now, during peace, ye take to yourselves the same liberty, as though
   all things were exposed to plunder, and ye were in a hostile country,
   lately the scene of warfare."

   We now then perceive the meaning of the Prophet. He first intimates
   that the people were now rejected by God, for they had rendered
   themselves, by their most abandoned life, wholly unworthy of his
   benefits; and at the same time he reproves their ingratitude that
   having been the people of God, they choose to make war with him rather
   than to observe the covenant which he had made for their safety; for it
   was a most shameful wickedness in them, since they had been chosen from
   the whole world to be a peculiar people, to prefer going to war with
   God rather than to live quietly under his protection. And that they did
   rise up against God he proves, for they gave themselves up to
   robberies; they plundered, even during times of peace, which
   circumstance greatly aggravated their wickedness. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [86] Newcome gives the same meaning to this part of the line, though
   another to the former part,-- But of old my people hath risen up as an
   enemy. Henderson's version is the same. The word rendered "of old"
   means "yesterday," and expresses often past time indefinitely. It is
   once rendered "of old," Isaiah 30:33; but in other places,
   "heretofore," "in times past;" but "formerly," or "of late," would be
   the most suitable expression in this passage. -- Ed.

   [87] The literal rendering of these two lines may be given thus:-- From
   off the garment the mantle ye shall strip
   From those who pass by securely, returning from war. Or the last words,
   svvy mlchmh, "averters of war," may designate people of a peaceable
   disposition, and "war" may be taken for strife or contention; then the
   rendering would be, "who turn away from contention." Newcome, on the
   authority of one MS., which has svy, gives this version, "captives of
   war," which seems unsuitable to this passage. Marckius renders the
   phrase thus, aversi belli, seu, a bello, "turning away from war," or,
   "shy of war." This view evidently comports best with the context. --
   Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Micah 2:9

   9. The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses;
   from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.

   9. Mulieres populi mei expulistis e domo delectationum ipsarum, (est
   quidem mutatio numeri, sed hoc nihil ad rem;) a parvulis earum
   abstulistis decus (vel, ornamentum) meum perpetuo.


   He proceeds with the same subject, that they refrained from no acts of
   injustice. It was indeed a proof of extreme barbarity not to spare
   women and children, for they are both weak and helpless. Their sex
   exempts women from violence, and their age, children. [88] Even in
   wars, women, and also children, escape in safety. We hence see that the
   Prophet, by stating a part for the whole, proves here that the people
   had addicted themselves to cruelty really barbarous; they were not
   restrained from exercising it, no, not even on women and children.
   Since it was so, it follows, that their boast of being the chosen
   people was vain and fallacious.

   House of delights he ascribes to the women who, being the weaker sex,
   prefer being at home and in the shade, rather than going abroad. The
   more necessary it was that their recesses should remain safe to them.
   Now, what was taken away from the children, God calls it his ornament;
   for his blessing, poured forth on children, is the mirror of his glory:
   he therefore condemns this plunder as a sacrilege. The word lvlm,
   laoulam, designates the continuance of their crimes, as though he had
   said, that they were cruel without ever showing any repentance. Now it
   follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [88] This verse presents several anomalies. We have "women" and the
   verbs in the plural, and then "house," "her delights," and "her
   children." It may be thus rendered, -- The women of my people ye drive
   away,
   Each from the house of her delights;
   From off her children ye take away my ornament forever. The word
   rendered in our version "flory," is hdr, which means ornament, beauty.
   Piscator says, pulchras vestes quas Deus illis donavit -- "the
   beautiful garments which God gave them." God claimed the land of Canaan
   and all its blessings as his own. They took these away without
   restoring them according to the law. Henderson justly observes, that
   "ornament" is to be taken "collectively for the ornamental clothes
   which they wore, and with which they had been provided by Jehovah." --
   Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Micah 2:10

   10. Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is
   polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction.

   10. Surgite, abite, quia non est haec requies; quoniam polluta est;
   dissipavit dissipatione violenta (interponitur copula, et dissipatione;
   ideo poterimus commode vertere, dissipavit et quidem dissipatione
   violenta, (vel, roborata; id enim significat verbum nmrph.)


   Here again the Prophet checks the foolish confidence of the people. The
   land of Canaan, we know, had been honored by God with the distinction
   of being a rest; yea God called it, not only the rest of the people,
   but also his own rest,

   I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest,'
   (Psalm 95:11.)

   The land of Canaan then was a sort of rest, hidden under the wings of
   God; for the Lord had assigned it as an inheritance to his chosen
   people. As God then dwelt in that land, and had also given it to the
   children of Abraham, that they might rest there in safety, and as this
   was also one of the blessings contained in the Law, hypocrites said,
   pursuing their usual course of falsely and groundlessly claiming to
   themselves the favors of God, that they could not be thence expelled,
   and that those Prophets were falsifiers who dared to change any thing
   in God's covenant. This is the reason why the Prophet now says,

   Arise, depart; this is not your rest. "False confidence," he says,
   "deceives you, as ye think that ye are inseparably fixed in your
   habitation. God indeed has made such a promise, but this condition was
   added, -- If ye will stand faithful to his covenant. Now ye are become
   covenant-breakers: ye think that he is fast bound to you; all the cords
   are loosened; for as ye have perfidiously departed from the Law of God,
   there is now no reason for you to think that he is under any obligation
   to you. There is then no ground for you to boast of being a holy
   people; you have indeed the name, but the reality has ceased to be:
   therefore arise and depart: but to sit still securely and proudly will
   avail you nothing, for God will now drive you afar off: and I now
   declare to you that you must arise and depart, for ye cannot rest in
   this land against the will of God: and God will now thrust you out of
   it." We now perceive the real meaning of the Prophet.

   He afterwards adds, For it is polluted; he will scatter you with
   violent scattering [89] Here again he vindicates God from their calumny
   and ungodly murmurings. We indeed know how difficult it was to bring
   down that people, who were steeped in so great a perverseness. And we
   find that the Prophet had a hard contest with the hypocrites, for the
   multitude had ever this language in their mouths, -- What! is it of no
   moment that God has favored us with so many and so remarkable promises?
   Is our adoption nothing but a mockery? Has he in vain given us this
   land by an hereditary right? Since then hypocrites thus brought forward
   their privileges in opposition to God, and yet abused them, it was
   necessary to convince them to the contrary, and this is what the
   Prophet does here, -- "Ye call," he says, "this land your rest, but how
   do you rest in it? God has commanded you to observe the Sabbath, for he
   dwells among you to sanctify you: but ye live disorderly, and carry on
   war with God himself: have not your pollutions obliterated that holy
   rest, which has been enjoined on you by God? Ye then see that this
   change has happened through your fault, that is, that God has ceased to
   call this land, as he was wont formerly to do, your and his own rest.
   It is not then your rest; he will therefore scatter you with violent or
   strong scattering: Ye in vain promise to yourselves rest in this land,
   since ye carry on war with God, and cease not to provoke his wrath
   against you." It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [89] The original is tchvl vchvl nmrph, which, according to Parkhurst,
   is, "It is bound;" that is, bound over to punishment, "and the bond is
   grievous;" or, as it may be rendered, strong; which is only found in
   Niphal in two other places, 1 Kings 2:8; Job 6:25. In the first it is
   rendered, grievous, -- "a grievous crime," and in the second, forcible,
   -- "How forcible are the right words!" But most others attach the idea
   of corruption and destruction to chvl: and Newcome takes the verb here
   in a passive sense, and gives this rendering of the distich, --
   "Because it is polluted, it shall be destroyed,
   And the destruction shall be great." Some render the verb actively,
   "It," i.e. the land, "shall destroy you," a reference being made, as it
   is thought, to what is said in Leviticus 18:25. The version of Marckius
   is this, -- "Quando quidem impuritas corrumpet,
   Et corruptio acris." -- Seeing that impurity will destroy it,
   And a violent destruction. The previous word tm'h is here taken as a
   noun. But the most literal, and the most satisfactory, is the rendering
   of Newcome. -- Ed.

   Micah 2:11

   11. If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I will
   prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the
   prophet of this people.

   11. Si vir ambulans in spiritu et fallaciter mantiens, stillem tibi pro
   vino et pro sicera, tunc erit stillans populi hujus (hoc est, hic demum
   erit Propheta populi hujus: sicut etiam priore membro proprie vertendum
   est, si prophetem.)


   The Prophet points out here another vice by which the people were
   infected -- that they wished to be soothed with flatteries: for all the
   ungodly think that they are in a manner exempt from God's judgment,
   when they hear no reproof; yea they think themselves happy, when they
   get flatterers, who are indulgent to their vices. This is now the
   disease which the Prophet discovers as prevailing among the people.
   Jerome sought out a meaning quite different here, as in the former
   verses; but I will not stop to refute him, for it is enough to give the
   real meaning of the Prophet. But as before he rendered women, princes,
   and thus perverted entirely the meaning, so he says here, I would I
   were a vain Prophet, that is, walking in vanity, and mendacious; as
   though Micah said "I wish I were false in denouncing on you the
   calamities of which I speak; for I would rather announce to you
   something joyful and favorable: but I cannot do this, for the Lord
   commands what is different." But there is nothing of this kind in the
   words of the Prophet. Let us then return to the text.

   If a man walks in the spirit, and deceitfully lies, [90] etc. Almost
   all interpreters agree in this, -- that to walk in the spirit, is to
   announce any thing proudly and presumptuously; and they take spirit for
   wind or for deceits. But I doubt not, but that to walk in the spirit
   was then a common mode of speaking, to set forth the exercise of the
   prophetic office. When therefore any one was a Prophet, or one who
   discharged that office, or sustained the character of a teacher, he
   professed himself to have been sent from above. The Prophets were
   indeed formerly called the men of the spirit, and for this reason,
   because they adduced nothing from themselves or from their own heads;
   but only delivered faithfully, as from hand to hand, what they had
   received from God. To walk in the spirit then means, in my view, the
   same thing as to profess the office of a teacher. When therefore any
   one professed the office of a teacher, what was he to do? "If I," says
   Micah, "being endued with the Spirit, and called to teach, wished to
   ingratiate myself with you, and preached that there would be an
   abundant increase of wine and strong drink, all would applaud me; for
   if any one promises these things, he becomes the prophet of this
   people."

   In short, Micah intimates that the Israelites rejected all sound
   doctrine, for they sought nothing but flatteries, and wished to be
   cherished in their vices; yea, they desired to be deceived by false
   adulation to their own ruin. It hence appears that they were not the
   people they wished to be deemed, that is, the people of God: for the
   first condition in God's covenant was, -- that he should rule among his
   people. Inasmuch then as these men would not endure to be governed by
   Divine power, and wished to have full and unbridled liberty, it was the
   same as though they had banished God far from them. Hence, by this
   proof, the Prophet shows that they had wholly departed from God, and
   had no intercourse with him. If there be then any man walking in the
   spirit, let him, he says, keep far from the truth; for he will not
   otherwise be borne by this people. -- How so? Because they will not
   have honest and faithful teachers. What is then to be done? Let
   flatterers come, and promise them plenty of wine and strong drink, and
   they will be their best teachers, and be received with great applause:
   in short, the suitable teachers of that people were the ungodly; the
   people could no longer bear the true Prophets; their desire was to have
   flatterers who were indulgent to all their corruptions.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [90] Perhaps a more literal rendering would be thus,-- If a man, the
   follower of the spirit and of deception,
   Speaks falsely, "I will prophesy to thee of wine and of strong drink,"
   He then becomes the prophet of this people. To walk after, or to
   follow, "the wind," as some render rvch, seems by no means proper. The
   phrase means the same as "the man of the spirit" in Hosea 9:7 Newcome
   changes the whole form of the passage, though not the meaning, except
   in one instance. Guided by the Syriac version, Houbigant and the
   Septuagint, without the sanction of any MS., he gives this version, --
   If a man, walking in the spirit of falsehood and lies,
   Prophesy unto thee for wine and for strong drink,
   He shall be the prophet of this people. He puts "for wine," etc., and
   not "of wine:" but the latter rendering is much more suitable to the
   context. -- Ed.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that since we cannot otherwise really profit by
   thy word, than by having all our thoughts and affections subjected to
   thee, and offered to thee as a sacrifice, -- O grant, that we maysuffer
   thee, by the sound of thy word, so to pierce through everything within
   us, that being dead in ourselves, we may live to thee, and never suffer
   flatteries to become our ruin but that we may, on the contrary,
   patiently endure reproofs, however bitter they may be, only let them
   serve to us as medicine, by which our inward vices may be cleansed,
   until at length being thoroughly cleansed and formed into new
   creatures, we may, by a pious and holy life, really glorify thy name,
   and be received into that celestial glory, which has been purchased for
   us by the blood of thy only-begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

   Micah 2:12-13

   12. I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather
   the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah,
   as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by
   reason of the multitude of men.

   12. Congregans congregabo te totum Jacob; colligens colligam residuum
   Israel; simul ponam eum tanquam oves Bosra, tanquam gregem in medio
   ovilis sui; tumultuabuntur prae hominibus (id est, propter hominum
   multitudinem.)

   13. The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have
   passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall
   pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them.

   13. Ascendet effractor coram ipsis; frangent et transibunt portam, et
   egredientur per ipsam; et transibit rex ipsorum coram ipsis; et Jehova
   in capite ipsorum.


   The exposition of this passage is twofold. The greater part of
   interpreters incline to this view, -- that God here promises some
   alleviation to the Israelites, after having sharply reproved them, and
   threatened them with utter ruin. They therefore apply this passage to
   the kingdom of Christ, as though God gave hope of a future restoration.
   But when I narrowly weigh every thing, I am, on the contrary, forced to
   regard these two verses as a commination, that is, that the Prophet
   here denounces God's future vengeance on the people. As, however, the
   former opinion is almost universally received, I will briefly mention
   what has been adduced in its favor, and then I shall return to state
   the other meaning, which I prefer.

   It is suitable to the kingdom of Christ to say, that a people who had
   been dispersed should be gathered under one head. We indeed know how
   miserable a dispersion there is in the world without him, and that
   whenever the Prophets speak of the renovation of the Church, they
   commonly make use of this form of expression, that is, that the Lord
   will gather the dispersed and unite them together under one head. If
   then the passage be referred to the kingdom of Christ, it is altogether
   proper to say, that God by gathering will gather the whole of Jacob.
   But a restriction is afterwards added, that no one may extend this
   restoration to the whole race of Abraham, or to all those who,
   according to the flesh, derived their descent from Abraham as their
   father: hence the word s'ryt, sharit, is laid down. Then the whole of
   Jacob is not that multitude, which, according to the flesh, traced
   their origin from the holy Patriarchs, but only their residue. It then
   follows, I will set them together as the sheep of Bozrah, that is, I
   will make them to increase into a large, yea, into an immense number;
   for they shall make a tumult, that is, a great noise will be made by
   them, as though the place could not contain so large a number. And they
   explain the next verse thus, -- A breaker shall go before them, that
   is, there shall be those who, with a hand, strong and armed, will make
   a way open for them; inasmuch as Christ says that the kingdom of heaven
   suffereth violence, (Matthew 11:12) they then mean that the people will
   have courageous leaders, whom nothing will stop from breaking through,
   and that they will also lead the whole people with them. They shall
   therefore go forth through the gate, and their king shall pass through.
   This also well agrees with the kingdom of Christ. For whenever God
   declares that he will be propitious to his Church, he at the same time
   adds, that he will give a king to his people; for their safety had been
   placed in that kingdom, which had been erected by the authority and
   command of God himself. It is therefore a common thing, and what occurs
   everywhere in the Prophets, that God would give a king from the seed of
   David to his people, when it would be his will to favor them with
   complete happiness. Thus they understand that a king shall pass on
   before them, which is the office of a leader, to show them the way. And
   Jehovah shall be at their head; that is, God himself will show himself
   to be the chief king of his people, and will ever defend by his help
   and grace those whom he adopts as his people.

   But I have already said that I more approve of another. exposition: for
   I see not how the Prophet could pass so suddenly into a different
   strain. He had said in the last verse that the people could endure no
   admonitions, for they only desired flatteries and adulation. He now
   joins what I have lately referred to respecting the near judgment of
   God, and proceeds, as we shall see, in the same strain to the end of
   the third chapter: but we know that the chapters were not divided by
   the Prophets themselves. We have therefore a discourse continued by the
   Prophet to the third chapter; not that he spoke all these things in one
   day; but he wished to collect together what he had said of the vices of
   the people; and this will be more evident as we proceed. I will now
   come to the words.

   Gathering, I will gather thee, the whole of Jacob; collecting, I will
   collect the remnant of Israel. God has two modes of gathering; for he
   sometimes gathers his people from dispersion, which is a singular proof
   of his favor and love. But he is said also to gather, when he assembles
   them together to devote and give them up to destruction, as we say in
   French, Trousser; and this verb is taken elsewhere in the same sense,
   and we have already met with an instance in Hosea. So, in the present
   passage, God declares that there would be a gathering of the people, --
   for what purpose? Not that being united together they might enjoy the
   blessings of God, but that they might be destroyed. As then the people
   had united together in all kinds of wickedness, so God now declares,
   that they should be gathered together, that the one and the same
   destruction might be to them all. And he adds, the remnant of Israel;
   as though he said, "Whatever shall remain from slaughters in wars and
   from all other calamities, such as famine and pestilence, this I will
   collect, that it may be wholly destroyed." He mentions the remnant,
   because the Israelites had been worn out by many evils, before the Lord
   stretched forth his hand at last to destroy them.

   He afterwards subjoins, I will set them together as the sheep of
   Bozrah; that is, I will cast them into one heap. Bozrah was a city or a
   country of Idumea; and it was a very fruitful place, and had the
   richest pastures: hence Isaiah 34, in denouncing vengeance on the
   Idumeans, alludes at the same time to their pastures, and says, "God
   will choose for himself fat lambs and whatever is well fed, and will
   also collect fatness, for the Lord has a sacrifice in Bozrah." So also,
   in this place, the Prophet says, that the Jews, when collected together
   as it were into a bundle, shall be like the sheep of Bozrah. And he
   further adds, as the sheep in the middle of the sheepfolds, though some
   render it, leading: dvr, daber, sometimes means to lead; but I see no
   reason why it should be drawn so far from its meaning in this
   connection. I take it as signifying a sheepfold, because sheep are
   there collected together. Some interpreters consider that a siege is
   referred to here, that is, that God would confine the whole people
   within cities, that they might not be open to the incursions of
   enemies; but I extend the meaning much wider, namely, that God would
   gather the people, in order at last to disperse them. I will then
   gather them, as I have already said, Je vous trousserai; as the sheep
   of Bozrah in the middle of the sheep fold; and there shall be a noise
   on account of their number; that is, "Though ye now glory in your
   number, this will avail you nothing; for I shall be able to reduce you
   all to strait, so that you may, as ye deserve, perish together."

   It follows, Ascend shall a breaker before them; that is, they shall be
   led in confusion; and the gate shall also be broken, that they may go
   forth together; for the passage would not be large enough, were they,
   as is usually done, to go forth in regular order; but the gates of
   cities shall be broken, that they may pass through in great numbers and
   in confusion. By these words the Prophet intimates, that all would be
   quickly taken away into exile. And they shall go forth, he says through
   the gate, and their king shall pass on before if them The Prophet means
   here, that the king would be made captive; and this was the saddest
   spectacle: for some hope remained, when the dregs of the people had
   been led into Chaldea; but when the king himself was led away a
   captive, and cast into prison, and his eyes pulled out, and his
   children slain, it was the greatest of misery. They were wont to take
   pride in their king, for they thought that their kingdom could not but
   continue perpetually, since God had so promised. But God might for a
   time overturn that kingdom, that he might afterwards raise it anew,
   according to what has been done by Christ, and according to what had
   been also predicted by the Prophets. "Crosswise, crosswise, crosswise,
   (transversa) let the crown be, until its lawful possessor comes." We
   then see that this, which the Prophet mentions respecting their king,
   has been added for the sake of amplifying.

   He afterwards adds, Jehovah shall be at the head of them; that is, He
   will be nigh them, to oppress and wholly to overwhelm them. Some
   consider something to be understood, and of this kind, that Jehovah was
   wont formerly to rule over them, but that now he would cease to do so:
   but this is too strained; and the meaning which I have stated seems
   sufficiently clear, and that is, -- that God himself would be the doer,
   when they should be driven into exile, and that he would add courage to
   tyrants and their attendants, in pursuing the accursed people, in order
   to urge on more and more and aggravate their calamities and thus to
   show that their destruction vault happen through his righteous
   judgment. We now then understand the real meaning of the Prophet. [91]
   Now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [91] Calvin is not singular in his view of this passage. Scott takes
   the same view, while Henry regards the passage as containing a promise,
   and so do Marckius, Newcome, and Henderson. But some have considered
   the words as those of the false prophets, referred to in the eleventh
   verse, and that Micah answers them in the next chapter. There is no
   sufficient ground for this opinion. Of those who regard the passage as
   including a promise, some apply it to the restoration from the
   Babylonian captivity, and others to spiritual restoration by the
   gospel. But the passage, viewed by itself, and in its connection with
   the next chapter, bears evidently the appearance of a commination:
   there are especially two words which manifestly favor this view, --
   thymnh and hphrph; both are taken generally, if not uniformly, in a bad
   sense. The first means to tumultuate, to be turbulent and riotous, to
   be clamorous and noisy; the second signifies to demolish, to break
   through, to destroy, and in every instance in which it is found as a
   personal noun, it means a destroyer or a robber. -- See Psalm 17:4;
   Ezekiel 18:10; Daniel 11:14. The first is a verb in the second person
   plural of the future tense, and in the feminine gender, because of the
   comparison made in the former lines to sheep and a flock. The verbs in
   the 12^th verse are all in the future tense, and the two first in the
   13^th are in the past, according to what is common in prophecies, but
   must be rendered as futures. I propose the following version of the
   passage, -- 12. Gathering, I will gather Jacob, the whole of thee;
   Assembling, I will assemble the residue of Israel;
   Together will I set them as the sheep of Bozrah,
   As a flock in the midst of its fold; --
   Ye shall be more noisy than men. 13. Ascend shall the breaker in the
   sight of them,
   -- they shall break through,
   And pass the gate, yea, they shall go forth through it,
   And pass shall their king before them,
   And Jehovah shall be at their head,
   or, for their leader. -- Ed.

   Micah 3:1-3

   1. And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of
   the house of Israel; Is it not for you to know judgment?

   1. Et dixi, Audite quaeso principes Jacob et gubernatores domus Israel;
   annon vestrum est (vel, ad vos spectat) scire judicium?

   2. Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from
   off them, and their flesh from off their bones;

   2. Atqui oderunt bonum et dilligunt malum, rapiunt pellem ab ipsis, et
   carnem ab ossibus eorum;

   3. Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off
   them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the
   pot, and as flesh within the caldron.

   3. Et tunc vorant carnem populi mei, et pellem ipsorum ab ipsis
   excoriant; et ossa eorum frangunt, et comminuunt; sicuti ad ollam (vel,
   ac si destinata essent ollae,) et carnem eorum in medio aheni.


   The Prophet in this chapter assails and severely reproves the chief men
   as well as the teachers; for both were given to avarice and cruelty, to
   plunder, and, in short, to all other vices. And he begins with the
   magistrates, who exercised authority among the people; and briefly
   relates the words in which he inveighed against them. We have said
   elsewhere, that the Prophets did not record all that they had spoken,
   but only touched shortly on the heads or chief points: and this was
   done by Micah, that we might know what he did for forty or more years,
   in which he executed his office. He could have related, no doubt, in
   half-an-hour, all that exists of his writings: but from this small
   book, however small it is, we may learn what was the Prophet's manner
   of teaching, and on what things he chiefly dwelt. I will now return to
   his words.

   He says that the chief men of the kingdom had been reproved by him. It
   is probable, that these words were addressed to the Jews; for though at
   the beginning he includes the Israelites, we yet know that he was given
   as a teacher to the Jews, and not to the kingdom of Israel. It was as
   it were accidental, that he sometimes introduces the ten tribes
   together with the Jews. This address then was made, as I think, to the
   king as well as to his counselors and other judges, who then ruled over
   the people of Judah.

   Hear this, I pray, he says. Such a preface betokens carelessness in the
   judges; for why does he demand a hearing from them, except that they
   had become so torpid in their vices, that they would attend to nothing?
   Inasmuch then as so brutal a stupor had seized on them, he says, Hear
   now ye chiefs, or heads, of Jacob, and ye rulers [92] of the house of
   Israel But why does he still speak of the house of Israel? Because that
   name was especially known and celebrated, whenever a mention was made
   of the posterity of Abraham: and the other Prophets, even while
   speaking of the kingdom of Judah, often make use of this title, "ye who
   are called by the name of Israel;" and they did this, on account of the
   dignity of the holy Patriarch; and the meaning of the word itself was
   no ordinary testimonial of excellency as to his whole race. And this is
   what is frequently done by Isaiah. But the name of Israel is not put
   here, as elsewhere, as a title of distinction: on the contrary, the
   Prophet here amplifies their sin, because they were so corrupt, though
   they were the chief men among the chosen race, being those whom God had
   honored with so much dignity, as to set them over his Church and elect
   people. It was then an ingratitude, not to be endured to abuse that
   high and sacred authority, which had been conferred on them by God.

   Does it not belong to you, he says, to know judgment? Here he intimates
   that rectitude ought to have a place among the chief men, in a manner
   more especial than among the common people; for it behoves them to
   excel others in the knowledge of what is just and right: for though the
   difference between good and evil be engraven on the hearts of all, yet
   they, who hold supremacy among the people, and excel in power, are as
   it were the eyes of the community; as the eyes direct the whole body,
   so also they, who are placed in any situation of honor, are thus made
   eminent, that they may show the right way to others. Hence by the word,
   to know, the Prophet intimates that they wickedly subverted the whole
   order of nature, for they were blind, while they ought to have been the
   luminaries of the whole people. Is it not for you, he says, to know
   judgment and equity? But why was this said, especially to the chief
   men? Because they, though they of themselves knew what was right,
   having the law engraven within ought yet as leaders to have possessed
   superior knowledge, so as to outshine others. It is therefore your duty
   to know judgment. We hence learn that it is not enough for princes and
   magistrates to be well disposed and upright; but it is required of them
   to know judgment and wisdom that they may discern matters above the
   common people. But if they are not thus endued with the gift of
   understanding and wisdom let them ask of the Lord. We indeed know, that
   without the Spirit of God, the acutest men are wholly unfit to rule;
   nor is it in vain, that the free Spirit of God is set forth, as holding
   the supreme power in the world; for we are thus reminded, that even
   they who are endued with the chief gifts are wholly incapable of
   governing except the Spirit of God be with them. This passage then
   shows that an upright mind is not a sufficient qualification in
   princes; they must also excel in wisdom, that they may be, as we have
   already said, as the eyes are to the body. In this sense it is that
   Micah now says that it belonged to the leaders of the people to know
   judgment and justice. [93]

   He afterwards subjoins, But they hate good, and love evil, and pull off
   the skin [94] from my people, the flesh from their bones; that is, they
   leave nothing, he says, sound and safe, their rapacity being so
   furious. The Prophet conveys first a general reproof, -- that they not
   only perverted justice, but were also given to wickedness and hated
   good. He means then that they were openly wicked and ungodly, and also
   that they with a fixed purpose carried on war against every thing just
   and right. We hence learn how great and how abominable was the
   corruption of the people, when they were still the peculiar possession
   and heritage of God. Inasmuch then as the state of this ancient people
   had become so degenerated, let us learn to walk in solicitude and fear,
   while the Lord governs us by pious magistrates and faithful pastors:
   for what happened to the Jews might soon happen to us, so that wolves
   might bear rule over us, as indeed experience has proved even in this
   our city. The Prophet afterwards adds the kinds of cruelty which
   prevailed; of which he speaks in hyperbolical terms, though no doubt he
   sets before our eyes the state of things as it was. He compares the
   judges to wolves or to lions, or to other savage beasts. He says not
   that they sought the property of the people, or pillaged their houses;
   but he says that they devoured their flesh even to the very bones; he
   says that they pulled off their skin: and this he confirms in the next
   verse.

   They devour, he says, the flesh of my people, and their skin they strip
   off from them, and their bones they break in pieces and make small, as
   that which into the pot is thrown, and which is in the midst of the
   caldron [95] For when any one throws meat into the pot, he does not
   take the whole ox, but cuts it into pieces, and having broken it, he
   then fills with these pieces his pot or his caldron. The Prophet then
   enhances the cruelty of the princes; they were not content with one
   kind of oppression, but exercised every species of barbarous cruelty
   towards the people, and were in every respect like bears, or wolves, or
   lions, or some other savage beasts, and that they were also like
   gluttons. We now then perceive the Prophet's meaning.

   Now this passage teaches us what God requires mainly from those in
   power, -- that they abstain from doing injustice: for as they are armed
   with power, so they ought to be a law to themselves. They assume
   authority over others; let them then begin with themselves, and
   restrain themselves from doing evil. For when a private man is disposed
   to do harm, he is restrained at least by fear of the laws, and dares
   not to do any thing at his pleasure; but in princes there is a greater
   boldness; and they are able to do greater injustice: and this is the
   reason why they ought to observe more forbearance and humanity. Hence
   levity and paternal kindness especially become princes and those in
   power. But the Prophet here condemns the princes of his age for what
   deserved the highest reprehension; and their chief crime was cruelty or
   inhumanity, inasmuch as they spared not their own subjects.

   We now see that the Prophet in no degree flattered the great, though
   they took great pride in their own dignity. But when he saw that they
   wickedly and basely abused the power committed to them, he boldly
   resisted them, and exercised the full boldness of the Spirit. He
   therefore not only calls them robbers or plunderers of the people; but
   he says, that they were cruel wild beasts; he says, that they devoured
   the flesh, tore and pulled it in pieces, and made it small; and he says
   all this, that he might convey an idea of the various kinds of cruelty
   which they practiced. Now follow threatenings --

   The idea of sheep or flock, to which the people are compared in the

   a striking answer of Tiberius, the Emperor, to some governors, who
   solicited him to increase the taxes, -- "It is the property of a good
   shepherd to shear his sheep, not to skin them" -- Boni pastoris esse
   tondere pectus, non deglubere To "hate good, and to love evil," in the
   former sentence, betokens a character dreadful in the extreme; for good
   here, tvv means kindness, benevolence, the doing of good to others;
   this they hated: and evil, rh, means wrong, mischief, injury, the doing
   of harm, of wrong, and of injustice to others; and this they loved. How
   transmuted they were in their spirit into that of very fiends! "They
   hate to do good, hate to have any good done, and hate those that are
   good; and they love the evil, delight in mischief, and in those that do
   mischief." These words of Henry, no doubt, convey a correct view of the
   sentence. It might therefore be rendered, "Haters of benevolence, and
   lovers of mischief." -- Ed.

   savage cruelty: 1. They take off the skin; 2. They eat the flesh; 3.

   the princes is described." -- Cocceius.

   Micah 3:4

   4. Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them: he
   will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved
   themselves ill in their doings.

   4. Tunc clamabunt ad Jehovam, et non respondebit illis; sed abscondet
   faciem suam ab ipsis tempore illo, quemadmodum perverse egerunt in
   factis suis.


   Micah now denounces judgment on the chief men, such as they deserved.
   He says, They shall cry then to Jehovah The adverb 'z, az, is often put
   indefinitely in Hebrew, and has the force of a demonstrative, and may
   be taken as pointing out a thing, (deiktikos -- demonstratively,) then,
   or there, as though the Prophet pointed out by his finger things which
   could be seen, though they were far away from the sight of men. But in
   this place, the Prophet seems rather to pursue the subject to which I
   have already referred: for he had before stated that God would take
   vengeance on that people. This adverb of time then is connected with
   the other combinations, which have been already explained. [96] If,
   however, any one prefer a different meaning, namely that the Prophet
   meant here to hold them in suspense, as to the nearness of God's
   vengeance, I do not oppose him, for this sense is not unsuitable.
   However this may be, the Prophet here testifies that the crimes of the
   chief men would not go unpunished, though they did not think themselves
   to be subject either to laws or to punishment. As then the princes and
   magistrates regarded themselves as exempt, by some imaginary privilege,
   from the lot of other people, the Prophet declares here expressly, that
   a distress was nigh at hand, which would extort a cry from them: for by
   the word, cry, he means the miseries which were nigh at hand. They
   shall then cry in their distress. I have now explained the design of
   the Prophet.

   We indeed see how at this day those who are in high stations swell with
   arrogance; for as they abound in wealth, and as honor is as it were an
   elevated degree, so that being propped up by the shoulders of others
   they seem eminent, and as they are also feared by the rest of the
   people, they are on these accounts led to think that no adversity can
   happen to them. But the Prophet says, that such would be their
   distress, that it would draw a cry from them.

   They shall then cry, but Jehovah will not hear; that is, they shall be
   miserable and without any remedy. Jehovah will not answer them, but
   will hide from them his face, as they have done perversely; that is,
   God will not hear their complaints; for he will return on their own
   heads all the injuries with which he now sees his own people to be
   afflicted. And thus God will show that he was not asleep, while they
   were with so much effrontery practicing all kinds of wrong.

   It may however be asked here, how it is that God rejects the prayers
   and entreaties of those who cry to him? It must first be observed, that
   the reprobate, though they rend the air with their cries, do not yet
   direct their prayers to God; but if they address God himself, they do
   this clamorously; for they expostulate with him, and contend with him,
   yea, they vomit out their blasphemies, or at least they murmur and
   complain of their evils. The ungodly then cry, but not to the Lord; or
   if they address their cries to God, they are, as it has been said, full
   of glamour. Hence, except one is guided by the Spirit of God, he cannot
   pray from the heart. And we know that it is the peculiar office of the
   Spirit to raise up our hearts to heaven: for in vain we pray, except we
   bring faith and repentance: and who is the author of these but the Holy
   Spirit? It appears then that the ungodly so cry, that they only
   violently contend with God: but this is not the right way of praying.
   It is therefore no wonder that God rejects their clamors. The ungodly
   do indeed at times pour forth a flood of prayers and call on God's name
   with the mouth; but at the same time they are, as we have said, full of
   perverseness, and they never really humble themselves before God. Since
   then they pour forth their prayers from a bitter and a proud heart,
   this is the reason why the Prophet says now, that the Lord would not
   then hear, but hide his face from them at that time, inasmuch as they
   acted perversely [97]

   He shows here that God would not be reconciled to men wholly
   irreclaimable, who could not be restored by any means to the right way.
   But when any one falls [and repents] he will ever find God propitious
   to him, as soon as he cries to him; but when with obstinate minds we
   pursue our own course, and give no place to repentance, we close up the
   door of mercy against ourselves; and so what the Prophet teaches here
   necessarily takes place, -- the Lord hides his face in the day of
   distress. And we also hear what the Scripture says, -- that judgment
   will be without mercy to those who are not merciful, (James 2:11.)
   Hence if any one be inexorable to his brethren, (as we see at this day
   many tyrants to be, and we also see many in the middle class to be of
   the same tyrannical and wholly sanguinary disposition,) he will at
   length, whoever he may be, meet with that judgment which Micah here
   denounces. The sentence then is not to be taken in a general sense, as
   though he had said, that the Lord would not be reconciled to the
   wicked; but he points out especially those irreclaimable men, who had
   wholly hardened themselves, so that they had become, as we have already
   seen, altogether inflexible. The Prophet now comes to his second
   reproof.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [96] There is nothing in the context to which 'z, then, or at that
   time, can be referred, except to the two concluding verses of the last
   chapter, which ought not to have been separated from this. And this
   connection confirms the view, that these two verses contain not a
   promise but a threatening. The same time is meant by 'z as by vt hhy'
   in the following part of the verse; for it is usual with the Prophets
   to express generally or indefinitely at first what they afterwards more
   distinctly specify. -- Ed.

   [97] Literally, "As they have rendered evil their deeds," or, to coin a
   corresponding word, As they have evilized their deeds. To render their
   deeds evil was to render them afflictive, injurious, and oppressive to
   others, according to what has been previously described. Hence the
   following version of Henderson is incorrect, -- Because they have
   corrupted their doings. -- Ed.

   Micah 3:5

   5. Thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that make my people err,
   that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not
   into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.

   5. sic dicit Jehova super (vel, ad) prophetas, qui decipiunt populum
   meum, et mordent dentibus suis, et clamant, Paz; et si quis non dederit
   in os ipsorum, edicunt contra eum proelium:


   Micah accuses here the Prophets, in the first place, of avarice and of
   a desire for filthy lucre. But he begins by saying that he spoke by
   God's command, and as it were from his mouth, in order that his
   combination might have more weight and power. Thus then saith Jehovah
   against the Prophets: and he calls them the deceivers of the people:
   but at the same time he points out the source of the evil, that is, why
   or by what passion they were instigated to deceive, and that was,
   because the desire of gain had wholly possessed them, so that they made
   no difference between what was true and what was false, but only sought
   to please for the sake of gain. And he shows also, on the other hand,
   that they were so covetous of gain, that they declared war, if any one
   did not feed them. And God repeats again the name of his people: this
   had escaped my notice lately in observing on the words of Micah, that
   the princes devoured the flesh of God's people; for the indignity was
   increased when this wrong, was done to the people of God. Had the
   Assyrians, or the Ethiopians, or the Egyptians, been pillaged by their
   princes, it would have been more tolerable; but when the very people of
   God were thus devoured, it was, as I have said, less to be borne. So
   when the people of God were deceived, and the truth was turned to a
   lie, it was a sacrilege the more hateful.

   This then was the reason why he said, Who deceive my people [98] "This
   people is sacred to me, for I have chosen them for myself; as then they
   are destroyed by frauds and deceptions, is not my majesty in a manner
   dishonored -- is not my authority lessened?" We now then see the reason
   why the Prophet says, They deceive my people. It is indeed certain,
   that the Jews were worthy of such deceptions; and God elsewhere
   declares, that whenever he permitted false prophets to come among them,
   it was to try them to see what sort of people they were, (Deuteronomy
   13.) It was then their just reward, when liberty was given to Satan to
   prevent sound doctrine among the people. And no one is ever deceived,
   except through his own will. Though their own simplicity seems to draw
   many to destruction, yet there is ever in them some hypocrisy. But it
   does not extenuate the sin of false teachers, that the people deserve
   such a punishment: and hence the Prophet still goes on with his reproof
   and says, that they were the people of God, -- in what respect? By
   adoption. Though then the Jews had rendered themselves unworthy of such
   an honor, yet God counts them his people, that he might punish the
   wickedness of the false teachers, of which he now accuses them. It now
   follows, that they did bite with their teeth But I cannot finish today.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [98] "Who deceive my people," is better than, "Who cause my people to
   err," according to Newcome and Henderson; for what is referred to is
   the "peace," promised by the false prophets. Marckius' version is, "Who
   seduce my people," and he makes this remark, --that the people had
   three seducers, -- the devil, their own deceitful hearts, and the false
   prophets. -- Ed.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou wouldest have the image of thy
   justice to shine in princes, and whom thou arrest with the sword, that
   they might rule in thy name, and be really thy ministers, -- O grant,
   that this thy blessing may openly appear among us, and that by this
   evidence thou mayest testify that thou art not only propitious to us,
   but hadst also a care for our safety, and watches over our welfare and
   well-being: and do thou so shine by thy word, that it may never be
   obscured or clouded among us through any depraved cupidity, but ever
   retain its own clear purity, so that we may proceed in the right path
   of salvation, which thou hast discovered and prescribed, until we be at
   length gathered into thy celestial kingdom, to enjoy that eternal
   inheritance, which has been procured for us by the blood of thy
   only-begotten Son. Amen.

   Lecture Eighty-sixth

   Let us proceed to explain that sentence of the Prophet, in which he
   shows the cause why the teachers deceived the people and turned the
   truth of God to a lie; and this was, because they were greedy of gains
   and were wholly given to avarice. We hence see, according to the
   testimony of Paul, that avarice affords a cause to all evils, (1
   Timothy 6:10;) and that wherever this contagion comes, all things
   necessarily fall into decay: for when avarice reigns in the hearts of
   men, the truth of God especially is ever adulterated.

   But Micah adduces two evidences of avarice, -- that they cried, Peace,
   when well fed and filled, -- and that they proclaimed war, when they
   were hungry. Then as to the first points he says, hnskym vsnyhm vqr'v
   slvm, that is, "who bite with their teeth, [99] and cry, Peace." But
   the sentence is to be so understood, that when they did bite well, they
   announced peace with full confidence: for by the word, bite, the
   Prophet means their gormandizing; for they who, under the guise of
   God's name, sought only their own advantage, were not satisfied with a
   moderate support, inasmuch as they were like hungry dogs. They
   therefore devoured, and gorged themselves, without any limits or
   moderation. This is the reason why he says that they did bite: for he
   compares them either to lions or to bears; and we know that wild beasts
   are not satiated with a small quantity of food, but that they gnash as
   it were their teeth except they are always pampered. So also Micah
   says, that the false teachers of his age were voracious men, who
   demanded a large proportion of food. We see the same thing in our day
   as to the monks under the Papacy, especially those who, under the name
   of mendacity, devour the substance of all people. Except they are
   pampered, they always murmur; nay, they are not content with murmurs,
   they proclaim war, as the Prophet says here. We indeed see at the same
   time, that they are insatiable; for when they come to tables well
   furnished, no one would say that they are men, but beasts, for they
   devour every thing. We now then understand the Prophet's meaning.

   But it is not voracity alone that is reprehended: he says, that they
   sold their blessings. when they were well filled and had their stomach
   well supplied. In the same manner the monks also are wont to pronounce
   peace when they are well fed, -- "O! ye do good, when ye take care of
   the brethren; for they are careful of you: when ye sleep in your beds,
   they watch, and their prayers make you rich; for how could the world
   stand, were it not that the brethren make amends for it? As then ye are
   so kind to our community, all things shall turn out well and
   prosperously to you, and God also will bless you." This then is the
   practice of those who for reward sell their blessings; they cry, Peace,
   that is, they confidently declare that all things shall be well, they
   make God propitious, provided such liberality towards their order be
   ever continued.

   But, on the other hand, he also says, If any one gives not to their
   mouth, they instantly sanctify war against you [100] : but I give a
   different rendering, as the passage requires, -- that they reclaim war;
   though the word is literally to sanctify. But we have seen in Joel 2,
   that the word is used to designate any solemn proclamation, --
   "Sanctify a fast", that is, Proclaim a fast. So also in this place,
   They sanctify war, that is, they proclaim war, when any one does not
   feed them, nor satisfy their gormandizing; for they could not bear
   want. In short, the Prophet shows, that these false teachers were so
   blinded by avarice, that they discerned not the difference between
   right and wrong; but only praised those who fed them: and, on the other
   hand, when they found that they and their stomach were not cared for
   nor satisfied, they cursed, fulminated, and uttered nothing but
   anathemas; as we see to be done at this day by the monks under the
   Papacy. The Prophet now says --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [99] The expression, "to bite with the teeth," is singular, when
   understood to signify voraciousness, as evidently it does here; for the
   corresponding words in the next distich, "who put not into their
   mouth," seem to require this meaning. Almost all critics, except some
   of the Greek Fathers, who followed the Septuagint, agree in attaching
   to this import to the sentence. The paraphrase of Rabbi Jonathan is,
   "To him who offers to them a feast of meat, they prophesy peace."
   Jerome's view is the same. Dathias gives this paraphrase, dum illis
   datur quod edunt -- "While is given them something to eat." Henry's
   comment is much to the purpose, -- "They will flatter and compliment
   those who will feed them with good bits, will give them something to
   eat; but as for those who put not into their mouths, who are not
   continually cramming them, they look upon them as their enemies; to
   them they do not cry, Peace, but even prepare war against them; against
   them they denounce the judgments of God: they preach either comfort or
   terror to men, not according as they are to God, but as they are to
   them; as the crafty priests of the Church of Rome, in some places, make
   their image either to smile or to frown upon the offerer, according as
   his offering is." -- Ed.

   [100] The original may be thus rendered,-- But whosoever will not put
   into their mouth,
   Even against him they will proclaim war. -- Ed.

   Micah 3:6-7

   6. Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a vision;
   and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun
   shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.

   6. Propterea nox vobis erit a visione (vel, pro visione, vel propter
   visionem; dicemus postea de sensu,) et tenebrae vobis a divinatione
   (vel, propter divinationem,) et occumbet sol super prophetas, et
   obtenebrabitur super eos dies;

   7. Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea,
   they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God.

   7. Et pudefient videntes (hoc est, prophetae,) et erubescent divini, et
   velabunt (hoc est, velum opponent) super labium suum omnes; quia non
   erit responsum Dei.


   God declares here to the false teachers by the mouth of Micah, that he
   would inflict punishment on them, so that they should be exposed to the
   reproach of all. Hence the kind of punishment of which the Prophet
   speaks is -- that he would strip the false teachers of all their
   dignity, so that they should hereafter in vain put on an appearance,
   and claim the honorable name which they had so long abused. We indeed
   know, when ungodly and profane men clothe themselves with the dignified
   titles of being the princes, or bishops, or prelates of the Church, how
   audaciously they pervert every thing, and do so with impunity. There is
   then no other remedy, except God pulls off the mask from them, and
   openly discovers to all their baseness. Of this punishment Micah now
   speaks.

   There shall be to you a night from vision; so is the phrase literally,
   but the particle m, mem, means often, for, or, on account of; and we
   can easily see that the Prophet represents night as the reward for
   visions and darkness for divination. "As then my people have been
   deceived by your fallacies, for your visions and divinations have been
   nothing but lies and deceits, I will repay you with the reward which
   you have deserved: for instead of a vision you shall have night, and
   instead of divination you shall have thick darkness." [101] It is
   indeed certain, that the false teachers, even when they were, as they
   say, in great reputation, that is, when they retained the honor and the
   title of their office, were blind and wholly destitute of all light:
   but the Prophet here declares, that as their baseness did not appear to
   the common people, God would cause it to be made at length fully
   evident. As for instance, there is nothing at this day more stupid and
   senseless than the bishops of the Papacy: for when any one draws from
   them any expression about religion, they instantly betray not only
   their ignorance, but also their shameful stupidity. With regard to the
   monks, though they be the most audacious kind of animals, (audacissimum
   animalium genus,) yet we know how unlearned and ignorant they are.
   Therefore at this time the night has not yet passed away, nor the
   darkness, of which Micah speaks here.

   We now then understand what the Holy Spirit teaches here, and that is,
   -- that God would at length strip those false teachers of that
   imaginary dignity, on account of which no one dared to speak against
   them, but received as an oracle whatever they uttered. Night, then,
   shall be to you instead of a vision; that is, "The whole world shall
   understand that you are not what you boast yourselves to be: for I will
   show that there is not in you, no, not a particle of the prophetic
   spirit, but that ye are men as dark as night, and darkness shall be to
   you instead of divination. Ye boast of great acuteness and great
   perspicuity of mind; but I will discover your baseness, so that the
   very children may know that you are not endued with the spirit."

   To the same purpose is what he adds, Go down shall the sun upon you,
   and darkened over you shall be the day; that is, such will be that
   darkness, that even at noon they will see nothing; the sun will shine
   on all, but they shall grope as in the dark; so that Gods vengeance
   would be made so manifest, that it might be noticed by all, from the
   least to the greatest.

   He confirms the same thing in the next verse, And ashamed shall be the
   seers and confounded the diviners, [102] and they shall cover their
   lip; that is they will put veils on their mouths. In short, he means,
   that they would become a reproach to all, so that they would be ashamed
   of themselves, and no more dare to boast with so much confidence of
   their name and of the prophetic office.

   As to this form of expression, vtv l-sphm, uothu ol shephim, some think
   that the practice of mourners is referred to; but this interpretation
   is frigid. I have therefore no doubt but that Micah intimates that the
   mouths of the false teachers would be closed. There is nearly the same
   denunciation mentioned by Zechariah; for speaking of the restoration of
   the Church, he says, -- They who before went about boasting greatly,
   and gloried in the name of Prophets, shall cast away their mantle, and
   will no longer dare to show themselves; yea, when they shall come
   abroad, they shall be as it were herdsman or private persons, and shall
   say, "I am not a prophet, nor the son of a prophet, I am chastised by
   my father;" that is, they shall profess themselves unworthy of being
   called prophets; but that they are scholars under discipline,
   (Zechariah 13:5.) So also in this place, "They deceive at this day my
   people," saith the Lord; "I will reward them as they deserve; I will
   fill them with disgrace and contempt. They shall not then dare
   hereafter to show themselves as they have been wont to do; they shall
   not presume boastingly to profess themselves to be the pillars of the
   Church, that the whole world may be made subject to them; they shall
   not dare with tyrannical force to oppress the common and ignorant
   portions of society Veil, then, shall they their mouth; that is, "I
   will cause their mouth to be closed, so that they shall not dare
   hereafter to utter even a word." [103]

   It follows, For there will be no answer from God. Some so explain this
   sentence, as though the Prophet upbraided them with their old deceits,
   which they boasted were the words of God: as then they were not
   faithful to God, but lied to miserable men, when they said, that they
   were sent from above, and brought messages from heaven, while they only
   uttered their own inventions or fables, they should on these accounts
   be constrained to cover their mouth. But different is the meaning of
   the Prophet, and it is this, -- that they were to be deprived of any
   answer, so that their want of knowledge might be easily perceived even
   by the most ignorant: for false teachers, though they possess nothing
   certain, yet deceive the simple with disguises, and render plausible
   their absurdities, that they may seem to be the interpreters of God;
   and they further add great confidence: and then the stupidity of the
   people concedes to them such great power, according to what is said by
   Jeremiah 5 where he says that the priests received gifts and that for
   gifts the Prophets divined, and that the people loved such
   deprivations. But Micah declares here that such delusions would no
   longer be allowed, for God would dissipate them. It will then be made
   evident, that you have no answer from God; that is, "All will perceive
   that you are void and destitute of every celestial truth, and that you
   were formerly but gross cheats, when ye passed yourselves as God's
   servants, though you had no ground for doing so."

   We now perceive what the Prophet means. But this punishment might have
   then contributed to the benefit of the people: for as it is a cause of
   ruin to the world, when there is no difference made between light and
   darkness; so when the baseness of those is discovered, who abuse God's
   name and adulterate his pure truth, there is then a door open to
   repentance. Rightly then is this combination addressed to false
   prophets. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [101] That this is the meaning is evident from the two last lines of
   the verse. It is a kind of parallelism, in which the four lines contain
   the same idea or ideas, announced in the two first lines in one form,
   and in the two last another, with more clearness, and sometimes with
   something additional. The preposition m has sometimes the meaning of
   rather than, but here, instead of. I would render the verse thus, --
   Therefore night shall be to you instead of vision,
   And darkness shall be to you instead of divination:
   Yea, set shall the sun upon the Prophets,
   And darken upon them shall the day. Piscator gives the sense when he
   says, Visio vestra mutabitur in noctem -- "Your vision shall be changed
   into night." -- Ed.

   [102] rsmym, manteis, Sept. fatidici, sootsayers, diviners. It is used
   generally in a bad sense, while chzym, seers is commonly used in a good
   sense; but here both words denote pretenders, the false prophets. --
   Ed.

   [103] The version of Newcome is, "They shall cover the mouth;" that is,
   as he adds in a note, "with part of the long eastern vesture. This
   action was a sign of being put to silence, of disgrace and dejection,
   Leviticus 13:45; Ezekiel 24:17, 22." There is no reason to render
   mouth, beard, as some have done. -- Ed.

   Micah 3:8

   8. But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the Lord, and of
   judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to
   Israel his sin.

   8. Atqui vere ego repletus sum virtute a Spiritu Jehovae, et judicio,
   et fortitudine, ad annuntiandum Jacob scelus suum, et Israeli peccatum
   suum.


   Here Micah, in a courageous spirit, stands up alone against all the
   false teachers even when he saw that they were a large number, and that
   they appealed to their number, according to their usual practice, as
   their shield. Hence he says, I am filled with power by the Spirit of
   Jehovah [104] This confidence is what all God's servants should
   possess, that they may not succumb to the empty and vain boastings of
   those who subvert the whole order of the Church. Whenever then, God
   permits his pure truth to be corrupted by false teachers, and them to
   be popular among those high in honor, as well as the multitude, let
   this striking example be remembered by us, lest we be discouraged, lest
   the firmness and invincible power of the Holy Spirit be weakened in our
   hearts, but that we may proceed in the course of our calling, and learn
   to oppose the name of God to all the deceptions of men, if indeed we
   are convinced that our service is approved by him, as being faithful.
   Since, then, Micah says, that he was filled with power, he no doubt
   stood, as it were, in the presence of the whole people, and alone
   pitched his camp against the whole multitude; for there were then false
   teachers going about every where, as the devil sows always seed enough,
   whenever God lets loose the reins. Though then their number was not
   small, yet Micah hesitated not to go forth among them: I, he says;
   there is stress to be laid on the pronoun 'nky, anki, -- Ye despise me,
   being one man, and ye despise a few men; ye may think that I alone
   serve the Lord; but I am a match for a thousand, yea, for an
   innumerable multitude; for God is on my side, and he approves of my
   ministry as it is. from him, nor do I bring any thing to you but what
   he has commanded: It is then I.

   He further expresses a fuller confidence by using the word 'vlm, aulam
   [105] ; Verily, he says, I am filled with power. This "verily" or truly
   is opposed to those lofty boastings by which the false prophets were
   ever wont to attain a name and honor among the people. But Micah
   intimates that all that they uttered was only evanescent: "Ye are," he
   says, "wonderful prophets; nay, ye are superior to the angels, if you
   are to be believed; but show that you are so in reality; let there be
   some proof by which your calling can be confirmed. There is no proof.
   It then follows, that ye are only men of wind, and not really
   spiritual: but there is really in me what ye boast of with your
   mouths." And he says, that he was filled, that he might not be thought
   one of the common sort: and Micah no doubt shows here, on account of
   the necessity of the occasion, that he was not supplied with ordinary
   or usual power; for, according as God employs the labors of his
   servants, so is he present with them, and furnishes them with suitable
   protection. When any one is not exercised with great difficulties in
   discharging his office of teaching, a common measure of the Spirit is
   only necessary for the performance of his duties; but when any one is
   drawn into arduous and difficult struggles, he is at the same time
   especially strengthened by the Lord: and we see daily examples of this;
   for many simple men, who have never been trained up in learning, have
   yet been so endued by the celestial Spirit, when they came to great
   trials, that they have closed the mouths of great doctors, who seemed
   to understand all oracles. By such evidences God openly proves at this
   day, that he is the same now as when he formerly endued his servant
   Micah with a power so rare and so extraordinary. This then is the
   reason why he says, that he was filled with power.

   He afterwards adds, By the Spirit of Jehovah Here the Prophet casts
   aside every suspicious token of arrogance; lest he should seem to claim
   anything as his own, he says, that this power was conferred on him from
   above: and this circumstance ought to be particularly noticed. Though
   Micah rightly and justly claimed to himself the name of a teacher, he
   yet had nothing different from others before the world; for all his
   opponents discharged the same office, and obtained the same honor: the
   office was common to both parties. Micah was either alone, or connected
   with Isaiah and a few others. Since then he here dares to set up
   himself, we see that his call alone must be regarded; for we know how
   great is the propensity of Satan to oppose the kingdom of Christ, and
   also how proud and fierce are false teachers. Since then the rage of
   Satan is well known and the presumption of false teachers, there is no
   reason why the faithful should make much of mere naked titles: and when
   they, who lived at that time, declared, as Papists do at this day, that
   they had no discrimination nor judgment to know, whether of them ought
   to have been deemed impostors or the ministers of God, inasmuch as
   Micah was alone and they were many, and also that the others were
   prophets that at least they had the name and repute of being so, --
   what was to be done? This was the reason why I have said that this
   circumstance was worthy of special notice, -- that though their
   vocation was common, yet as they had acted perfidiously, and Micah
   alone, or with few others, had faithfully performed what the Lord had
   commanded, he alone is to be deemed a Prophet and a teacher: in short,
   there is no reason for false prophets to set up against us a mere
   coveting, when they cannot prove that they are endued with the Spirit
   of God. Whosoever then desires to be deemed a servant of God, and a
   teacher in his Church, must have this seal which Micah here adduces; he
   must be endued with the Spirit of God; honor then will be given to God.
   But if any one brings nothing but the name, we see how vain before God
   it is.

   He afterwards subjoins With judgment and courage. (fortitudine) By
   judgment, I have no doubt, he understands discernment, as this is also
   the common meaning of the word. He then adds courage These two things
   are especially necessary for all ministers of the word, -- that is, to
   excel in wisdom, to understand what is true and right, and to be also
   endued with inflexible firmness, by which they may overcome both Satan
   and the whole world, and never turn aside from their course, though the
   devil may in all ways assail them. We hence see what these two words
   import. He had put kch, kech, first, power; but now he mentions gvvrh,
   gebure, courage or magnanimity. By the term, power, he meant generally
   all the endowments, with which all who take upon them the office of
   teaching ought to be adorned. This qualification is then first
   required, and it is a general one: but Micah divides this power of the
   prophets into two kinds, even into wisdom or judgment, and into
   courage; and he did this, that they might understand what God intended:
   Let them excel in doctrine; and then that they may be confirmed, let
   them not yield to any gales that may blow, nor be overcome by threats
   and terrors; let them not bend here and there to please the world; in a
   word, let them not succumb to any corruptions: it is therefore
   necessary to add courage to judgment.

   He then adds, To declare to Jacob his wickedness, [106] and to Israel
   his sin. We here see that the Prophet did not hunt for the favor of the
   people. Had he courted their approbation, he must have soothed with
   flatteries those who sought flatteries; and were already seized with
   such hatred and malignant feelings, that they had rejected Micah. He
   must then have spoken softly to them, to please them; but this he did
   not do. "On the one hand," he says, "these men sell to you their
   blessings and deceive you with the hope of peace; and, on the other,
   they denounce war, except their voracity is satisfied; and thus it is
   that they please you; for so ye wish, and ye seek such teachers as will
   promise you wine and strong drink: but I am sent to you for another
   purpose; for the Lord has not deposited flatteries with me, such as may
   be pleasant to you; but he has deposited reproofs and threatenings. I
   shall therefore uncover your crimes, and will not hesitate to condemn
   you before the whole world, for ye deserve to be thus treated." We now
   perceive why the Prophet says, that he was endued with power to declare
   his wickedness to Jacob, etc.

   But we hence learn how necessary it is for us to be supported by
   celestial firmness, when we have to do with insincere and wicked men;
   and this is almost the common and uniform lot of all God's servants;
   for all who are sent to teach the word are sent to carry on a contest.
   It is therefore not enough to teach faithfully what God commands,
   except we also contend: and though the wicked may violently rise up
   against us, we must yet put on a brazen front, as it is said in Ezekiel
   3:8, 9; nor must we yield to their fury, but preserve invincible
   firmness. Since then we have a contest with the devil, with the world,
   and with all the wicked, that we may faithfully execute our office, we
   must be furnished with this courage of which Micah speaks.

   As I have already shown that God's servants ought courageously to break
   through all those obstacles by which Satan may attempt either to delay
   or to force them backward; so also the doctrine taught here ought to be
   applied to all the godly: they ought wisely to distinguish between the
   faithful servants of God and impostors who falsely pretend his name.
   Then no one, who desires truly and from the heart to obey God, will be
   deceived; for the Lord will ever give the spirit of judgment and
   discrimination. And the reason why at this day many miserable souls are
   led to endless ruin is, because they either shut their eyes, or
   willfully dissemble, or designedly involve themselves in such
   subterfuges as these, -- "I cannot form any judgment; I see on both
   sides learned and celebrated men, at least those who are in some repute
   and esteem: some call me to the right hand, and others to the left,
   where am I to retake myself? I therefore prefer to close my mouth and
   my ears." Thus many, seeking a cloak for their sloth, often manifest
   their ignorance: for we see that the eyes must be opened when the Lord
   exercises and tries our faith: and he suffers discords and contentions
   to arise in the Church that some may choose this, and others that.
   Though God then relaxes the reins of Satan, that contests and turmoils
   of this kind may be excited in the Church, there is yet no excuse for
   us, if we follow not what the Lord prescribes; for he will ever guide
   us by his Spirit, provided we foster not our own slothfulness. It
   follows--

   [104] Jerome renders "the Spirit of Jehovah" in the genitive case,
   which in meaning amounts to the same thing; but Newcome puts the words
   in apposition with "power." The 't before Spirit seems to betoken a
   difference in its connection with "filled." It appears to be here a
   preposition, ab, by. The "power," kch, is the dunamis of the New
   Testament; and "judgment," mspht, is discernment or discrimination; and
   "might" or courage, gvvrh, is "an intrepid firmness of mind," as
   Marckius observes, "against all opposing evils and hindrances." -- Ed.

   [105] Marckius renders it the same, verè, and says, that it is of the
   same import with Amen, Amen, so often used by our Savior. Truly is
   adopted by Newcome and Henderson. -- Ed.

   [106] Scelus, phs; it means defection, apostacy, rebellion, a willful
   transgression, and a proud contempt of divine law and institutions; it
   is anomia -- lawlessness, as it is sometimes rendered by the
   Septuagint. But "sin," cht'h, is a deviation from what is right through
   delusion, mistaken views, error, ignorance, or infirmity. The first
   included idolatry and gross acts of imposture and oppression; the
   second, the superstition of the people, and their common vices. Muis,
   as quoted by Leigh, says that phs is "defection from God or rebellion,
   and prevarication towards God," -- defectio à Deo seu rebellio, ac
   praevaricatio in Deum And he quotes also Mollerius as describing cht'h
   as including not only sins of error, ignorance, and infirmity, but also
   those of omission, -- Ea potissimum peccata significat, quae vel
   errore, vel per ignorantiam, vel per infirmitatem carnis, committuntur;
   item peccata omissionis -- Ed.

   Micah 3:9-10

   9. Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes
   of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.

   9. Audite hoc, quaeso, principes domus Jacob, et gubernatores domus
   Israel, qui abominantur (est mutatio personae) judicium, et recitudinem
   omnem pervertunt;

   10. They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.

   10. Qui aedificat [107] (nunc est mutatio numeri) Sionem in
   sanguinibus, et Jerusalem in iniquitate.


   The Prophet begins really to prove what he had stated, -- that he was
   filled with the power of the Holy Spirit: and it was, as they say, an
   actual proof, when the Prophet dreaded no worldly power, but boldly
   addressed the princes and provoked their rage against him, Hear, he
   says, ye heads, ye rulers of the house of Jacob, ye men who are cruel,
   bloody, and iniquitous. We then see that the Prophet had not boasted of
   what he did not without delay really confirm. But he began with saying,
   that he was filled with the Spirit of God, that he might more freely
   address them, and that he might check their insolence. We indeed know
   that the ungodly are so led on headlong by Satan, that they hesitate
   not to resist God himself: but yet the name of God is often to them a
   sort of a hidden chain. However much then the wicked may rage, they yet
   become less ferocious when the name of God is introduced. This is the
   reason why the Prophet had mentioned the Spirit of God; it was, that
   there might be a freer course to his doctrine.

   When he now says, Ye heads of the house of Jacob, ye rulers of the
   house of Israel, it is by way of concession, as though he had said,
   that these were indeed splendid titles, and that he was not so absurd
   as not to acknowledge what had been given them by God, even that they
   were eminent, a chosen race, being the children of Abraham. The Prophet
   then concedes to the princes what belonged to them, as though he had
   said, that he was not a seditious man, who had no care nor
   consideration for civil order. And this defense was very necessary, for
   nothing is more common than for the ungodly to charge God's servants
   with sedition, whenever they use a freedom of speech as it becomes
   them. Hence all who govern the state, when they hear their corruptions
   reproved, or their avarice, or their cruelty, or any of their other
   crimes, immediately cry out, -- "What! if we suffer these things, every
   thing will be upset: for when all respect is gone, what will follow but
   brutal outrage? for every one of the common people will rise up against
   the magistrates and the judges." Thus then the wicked ever say, that
   God's servants are seditious whenever they boldly reprove them. This is
   the reason why the Prophet concedes to the princes and judges of the
   people their honor; but a qualifying clause immediately follows, -- Ye
   are indeed the heads, ye are rulers; but yet they hate judgment:" he
   does not think them worthy of being any longer addressed. He had indeed
   bidden them to hear as with authority; but having ordered them to hear,
   he now uncovers their wickedness, They hate, he says, judgments and all
   rectitude pervert: [108] each of them builds Zion by blood, and
   Jerusalem by iniquity; that is, they turn their pillages into
   buildings: "This, forsooth, is the splendor of my holy city even of
   Zion! where I designed the ark of my covenant to be placed, as in my
   only habitation, even there buildings are seen constructed by blood and
   by plunder! See, he says, how wickedly these princes conduct themselves
   under the cover of their dignity!" [109]

   We now see that the word of God is not bound, but that it puts forth
   its power against the highest as well as the lowest; for it is the
   Spirit's office to arraign the whole world, and not a part only.

   When the Spirit shall come,' says Christ,
   it will convince the world,' (John 16:8.)

   He speaks not there of the common people only, but of the whole world,
   of which princes and magistrates form a prominent part. Let us then
   know, that though we ought to show respect to judges, (as the Lord has
   honored them with dignified titles, calling them his vicegerents and
   also gods,) yet the mouths of Prophets ought not to be closed; but they
   ought, without making any difference, to correct whatever is deserving
   of reproof, and not to spare even the chief men themselves. This is
   what ought in the first place to be observed.

   Then when he says, that Zion was built by blood, and Jerusalem by
   iniquity, it is the same as though the Prophet had said, that whatever
   the great men expended on their palaces had been procured, and, as it
   were, scraped together from blood and plunder. The judges could not
   have possibly seized on spoils on every side, without being bloody,
   that is, without pillaging the poor: for the judges were for the most
   part corrupted by the rich and the great; and then they destroyed the
   miserable and the innocent. He then who is corrupted by money will
   become at the same time a thief; and he will not only extort money, but
   will also shed blood. There is then no wonder that Micah says, that
   Zion was built by blood He afterwards extends wider his meaning and
   mentions iniquity, as he wished to cast off every excuse from
   hypocrites. The expression is indeed somewhat strong, when he says,
   that Zion was built by blood. They might have objected and said, that
   they were not so cruel, though they could not wholly clear themselves
   from the charge of avarice. "When I speak of blood," says the Prophet,
   "there is no reason that we should contend about a name; for all
   iniquity is blood before God: if then your houses have been built by
   plunder, your cruelty is sufficiently proved; it is as though miserable
   and innocent men had been slain by your own hands." The words, Zion and
   Jerusalem, enhance their sin; for they polluted the holy city and the
   mount on which the temple was built by the order and command of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [107] It is vnh, in the singular number, with no variation as to number
   in the MSS. The Septuagint gives it a plural participle,
   hoioikodomountes. It may be rendered as a participial noun, "The
   building of Zion is by blood," etc., for h, when radical, does not
   always turn into t, when in regimine. -- Ed.

   [108] It often happens, as in the present case, that the relative h, in
   Hebrew, prefixed to a participle, has after it a verb in the future
   connected by v, and in person different from that to which the relative
   refers. The relative here refers to a noun in the second, and the verb
   connected with the participle is in the third person. It is an idiom,
   of which there are frequent instances. We find the same to be the case
   with the relative 'sr, in the third verse. It refers to the chiefs, who
   are addressed, and must therefore be viewed as in the second person,
   and all the verbs which follow it are in the third. Some render the
   participle, "who hate," which is in Hiphil, in a causative sense. See
   Amos 5:7; 6:12. The distich may then be rendered thus, -- Who render
   judgment hateful, (or, abominable,)
   And distort everything that is right, or more literally,
   And make crooked everything that is straight. -- Ed.

   [109] "They pretend," says Henry, "in justification of their extortion
   and oppressions, that they build up Zion and Jerusalem; they add new
   streets and squares to the holy cities and adorn them; they establish
   and advance the public interests both in church and state, and think
   therein they do God and Israel good service; but it is with blood and
   with iniquity, and therefore it cannot prosper; nor will their
   intentions of good to the city of God justify their contradictions to
   the law of God." A flaming zeal for a good cause can never consecrate
   extortion, injustice, and murder. It may be asked, What is the
   difference between Zion and Jerusalem? Zion was the church, Jerusalem
   was the state; or it may be, that, according to the usual style of the
   Prophets, the more limited idea is given first, and the more extensive
   one is added to it. -- Ed.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou wouldest have us to be ruled by the
   preaching of thy word, -- O grant, that those who have to discharge
   this office may be really endued with thy celestial power, that they
   may not attempt any thing of themselves, but with all devotedness spend
   all their labors for thee and for our benefit, that through them we may
   be thus edified, so that thou mayest ever dwell among us, and that we
   through our whole life may become the habitation of thy Majesty, and
   that finally we may come to thy heavenly sanctuary, where thou daily
   invites us, as an entrance there has been once for all opened to us by
   the blood of thy only-begotten Son. Amen.

   Micah 3:11-12

   11. The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach
   for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean
   upon the Lord, and say, Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come
   upon us.

   11. Principes ejus pro munere judicant, et sacerdotes ejus mercede
   docent, et prophetae ejus pecunia divinant, et super Jehova nituntur,
   dicendo, Annon Jehova in medio nostri? Non veniet super nos malum.

   12. Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and
   Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high
   places of the forest.

   12. Itaque propter vos Sion ut ager arabitur, et Jerusalem acervus
   erit, et mons domus in excelsa sylvae. [110]


   The Prophet shows here first, how gross and supine was the hypocrisy of
   princes as well as of the priests and prophets: and then he declares
   that they were greatly deceived in thus soothing themselves with vain
   flatteries; for the Lord would punish them for their sins since he had
   in his forbearance spared them, and found that they did not repent. But
   he does not address here the common people or the multitude, but he
   attacks the chief men: for he has previously told us, that he was
   endued with the spirit of courage. It was indeed necessary for the
   Prophet to be prepared with invincible firmness that he might freely
   and boldly declare the judgment of God, especially as he had to do with
   the great and the powerful, who, as it is well known, will not easily,
   or with unruffled minds, bear their crimes to be exposed; for they wish
   to be privileged above the ordinary class of men. But the Prophet not
   only does not spare them, but he even arraigns them alone, as though
   the blame of all evils lodged only with them, as indeed the contagion
   had proceeded from them; for though all orders were then corrupt, yet
   the cause and the beginning of all the evils could not have been
   ascribed to any but to the chief men themselves.

   And he says, Princes for reward judge, priests teach for reward, [111]
   the prophets divine for money: as though he had said, that the
   ecclesiastical as well as the civil government was subject to all kinds
   of corruptions, for all things were made matters of sale. We know that
   what the Holy Spirit declares elsewhere is ever true, -- that by gifts
   or rewards the eyes of the wise are blinded and the hearts of the just
   are corrupted, (Ecclus. 20:29,) for as soon erg judges open a way for
   rewards, they cannot preserve integrity, however much they may wish to
   do so. And the same is the case with the priests: for if any one is
   given to avarice, he will adulterate the pure truth: it cannot be, that
   a complete liberty in teaching should exist, except when the pastor is
   exempt from all desire of gain. It is not therefore without reason that
   Micah complains here, that the princes as well as the priests were
   hirelings in his day; and by this he means, that no integrity remained
   among them, for the one, as I have said, follows from the other. He
   does not say, that the princes were either cruel or perfidious, though
   he had before mentioned these crimes; but in this place he simply calls
   them mercenaries. But, as I have just said, the one vice cannot be
   separated from the other; for every one who is hired will pervert
   judgment, whether he be a teacher or a judge. Nothing then remains pure
   where avarice bears rule. It was therefore quite sufficient for the
   Prophet to condemn the judges and the prophets and the priests for
   avarice; for it is easy hence to conclude, that teaching was exposed to
   sale, and that judgments were bought, so that he who offered most money
   easily gained his cause. Princes then judge for reward, and priests
   also teach for reward

   We can learn from this place the difference between prophets and
   priests. Micah ascribes here the office or the duty of teaching to the
   priests and leaves divination alone to the prophets. We have said
   elsewhere, that it happened through the idleness of the priests, that
   prophets were added to them; for prophesying belonged to them, until
   being content with the altar, they neglected the office of teaching:
   and the same thing, as we find, has taken place under the Papacy. For
   though it be quite evident for what reason pastors were appointed to
   preside over the Church, we yet see that all, who proudly call
   themselves pastors, are dumb dogs. Whence is this? Because they think
   that they discharge their duties, by being only attentive to
   ceremonies; and they have more than enough to occupy them: for the
   priestly office under the Papacy is laborious enough as to trifles and
   scenic performances: (ritus histrionicos -- stage-playing rites) but at
   the same time they neglect the principal thing -- to feed the Lord's
   flock with the doctrine of salvation. Thus degenerated had the priests
   become under the Law. What is said by Malachi ought to have been
   perpetuated, -- that the law should be in the mouth of the priest, that
   he should be the messenger and interpreter of the God of hosts,
   (Malachi 2:7;) but the priests cast from them this office: it became
   therefore necessary that prophets should be raised up, and as it were
   beyond the usual course of things while yet the regular course formally
   remained. But the priests taught in a cold manner; and the prophets
   divined, that is professed that oracles respecting future things were
   revealed to them.

   This distinction is now observed by the Prophet, when he says, The
   priests teach for reward, that is, they were mercenaries, and hirelings
   in their office: and the prophets divined for money It then follows,
   that they yet leaned on Jehovah, and said, Is not Jehovah in the midst
   of us? Come then shall not evil upon us. The Prophet shows here, as I
   have said at the beginning, that these profane men trifled with God:
   for though they knew that they were extremely wicked, nay, their crimes
   were openly known to all; yet they were not ashamed to lay claim to the
   authority of God. And it has, we know, been a common wickedness almost
   in all ages, and it greatly prevails at this day, -- that men are
   satisfied with having only the outward evidences of being the people of
   God. There was then indeed an altar erected by the command of God;
   there were sacrifices made according to the rule of the Law; and there
   were also great and illustrious promises respecting that kingdom. Since
   then the sacrifices were daily performed, and since the kingdom still
   retained its outward form, they thought that God was, in a manner,
   bound to them. The same is the case at this day with the great part of
   men; they presumptuously and absurdly boast of the external forms of
   religion. The Papists possess the name of a Church, with which they are
   extremely inflated; and then there is a great show and pomp in their
   ceremonies. The hypocrites also among us boast of Baptism, and the
   Lord's Supper, and the name of Reformation; while, at the same time,
   these are nothing but mockeries, by which the name of God and the whole
   of religion are profaned, when no real piety flourishes in the heart.
   This was the reason why Micah now expostulated with the prophets and
   the priests, and the king's counselors; it was, because they falsely
   pretended that they were the people of God. [112]

   But by saying; that they relied on Jehovah, he did not condemn that
   confidence which really reposes on God; for, in this respect, we cannot
   exceed the bounds: as God's goodness is infinite, so we cannot trust in
   his word too much, if we embrace it in true faith. But the Prophet
   says, that hypocrites leaned on Jehovah, because they flattered
   themselves with that naked and empty distinction, that God had adopted
   them as his people. Hence the word, leaning or recumbing, is not to be
   applied to the real trust of the heart, but, on the contrary, to the
   presumption of men, who pretend the name of God, and so give way to
   their own will, that they shake off not only all fear of God, but also
   thought and reason. When, therefore, so great and so supine
   thoughtlessness occupies the minds of men, stupidity presently follows:
   and yet it is not without reason that Micah employs this expression,
   for hypocrites persuade themselves that all things will be well with
   them, as they think that they have God propitious to them. As then they
   feel no anxiety while they have the idea that God is altogether at
   peace with them, the Prophet declares, by way of irony, that they
   relied on Jehovah; as though he had said, that they made the name of
   God their support: but yet the Prophet speaks in words contrary to
   their obvious meaning, (katachrestikos loquitur -- speaks
   catachrestically;) for it is certain that no one relies on Jehovah
   except he is humbled in himself. It is penitence that leads us to God;
   for it is when we are cast down that we recumb on him; but he who is
   inflated with self-confidence flies in the air, and has nothing solid
   in him. And our Prophet, as I have said, intended indirectly to condemn
   the false security in which hypocrites sleep, while they think it
   enough that the Lord had once testified that they would be his people;
   but the condition is by them disregarded.

   He now recites their words, Is not Jehovah in the midst of us? Come
   will not evil upon us This question is a proof of a haughty
   self-confidence; for they ask as of a thing indubitable, and it is an
   emphatic mode of speaking, by which they meant to say, that Jehovah was
   among them. He who simply affirms a thing, does not show so much pride
   as these hypocrites when they set forth this question, "Who shall deny
   that Jehovah dwells in the midst of us?" God had indeed chosen an
   habitation among them for himself; but a condition was interposed, and
   yet they wished that he should be, as it were, tied to the temple,
   though they considered not what God required from them. They hence
   declared that Jehovah was in the midst of them; nay, they treated with
   disdain any one who dared to say a word to the contrary: nor is there a
   doubt but that they poured forth blasts of contempt on the Prophets.
   For whenever any one threatened what our Prophet immediately subjoins,
   such an answer as this was ever ready on their lips, -- "What! will God
   then desert us and deny himself? Has he in vain commanded the temple to
   be built among us? Has he falsely promised that we should be a priestly
   kingdom? Dost thou not make God a covenant-breaker, by representing him
   as approving of the terrors of thy discourse? But he cannot deny
   himself:" We hence see why the Prophet had thus spoken; it was to show
   that hypocrites boasted so to speaks of their proud confidence, because
   they thought that God could not be separated from them.

   Now this passage teaches us how preposterous it is thus to abuse the
   name of God. There is indeed a reason why the Lord calls us to himself,
   for without him we are miserable; he also promises to be propitious to
   us, though, in many respects, we are guilty before him: he yet, at the
   same time, calls us to repentance. Whosoever, then, indulges himself
   and continues sunk in his vices, he is greatly deceived, if he applies
   to himself the promises of God; for, as it has been said, the one
   cannot be separated from the other. [113] But when God is propitious to
   them, they rightly conclude, that all things will be well with them,
   for we know that the paternal favor of God is a fountain of all
   felicity. But in this there was a vicious reasoning, -- that they
   promised to themselves the favor of God through a false imagination of
   the flesh, and not through his word. Thus we see that there is ever in
   hypocrisy some imitation of piety: but there is a sophistry
   (paralogismus) either in the principle itself or in the argument.

   Now follows a threatening, Therefore, on your account, Zion as a field
   shall be plowed, and Jerusalem a heap shall be, and the mount of the
   house as the high places of a forest We here see how intolerable to God
   hypocrites are; for it was no ordinary proof of a dreadful vengeance,
   that the Lord should expose to reproach the holy city, and mount Zion,
   and his own temple. This revenge, then, being so severe, shows that to
   God there is nothing less tolerable than that false confidence with
   which hypocrites swell, for it brings dishonor on God himself; for they
   could not boast that they were God's people without aspersing him with
   many reproaches. What then is the meaning of this, "God is in the midst
   of us," except that they thereby declared that they were the
   representatives (vicarios) of God, that the kingdom was sacred and also
   the priesthood? Since then they boasted that they did not
   presumptuously claim either the priesthood or the regal power, but that
   they were divinely appointed, we hence see that their profanation of
   God's name was most shameful. It is then no wonder that God was so
   exceedingly displeased with them: and hence the Prophet says, For you
   shall Zion as a field be plowed; as though he said, "This is like
   something monstrous, that the temple should be subverted, that the holy
   mount and the whole city should be entirely demolished, and that
   nothing should remain but a horrible desolation, -- who can believe all
   this? It shall however, take place, and it shall take place on your
   account; you will have to bear the blame of this so monstrous a
   change." For it was as though God had thrown heaven and earth into
   confusion; inasmuch as he himself was the founder of the temple; and we
   know with what high encomiums the place was honored. Since then the
   temple was built, as it were, by the hand of God, how could it be
   otherwise, but that, when destroyed, the waste and desolate place
   should be regarded as a memorable proof of vengeance? There is
   therefore no doubt but that Micah intended to mark out the atrocity of
   their guilt, when he says, For you shall Zion as a field be plowed,
   Jerusalem shall become a heap of stones; that is, it shall be so
   desolated, that no vestige of a city, well formed and regularly built,
   shall remain.

   And the mount of the house, etc. He again mentions Zion, and not
   without reason: for the Jews thought that they were protected by the
   city Jerusalem; the whole country rested under its shadow, because it
   was the holy habitation of God. And again, the city itself depended on
   the temple, and it was supposed, that it was safe under this
   protection, and that it could hardly be demolished without overthrowing
   the throne of God himself: for as God dwelt between the cherubim, it
   was regarded by the people as a fortress incapable of being assailed.
   As then the holiness of the mount deceived them, it was necessary to
   repeat what was then almost incredible, at least difficult of being
   believed. He therefore adds, The mount of the house shall be as the
   high places of a forest; that is, trees shall grow there.

   Why does he again declare what had been before expressed with
   sufficient clearness? Because it was not only a thing difficult to be
   believed, but also wholly inconsistent with reason, when what the Lord
   had said was considered, and that overlooked which hypocrites ever
   forget. God had indeed made a covenant with the people; but hypocrites
   wished to have God, as it were, bound to them, and, at the same time,
   to remain themselves free, yea, to have a full liberty to lead a wicked
   life. Since then the Jews were fixed in this false opinion, -- that God
   could not be disunited from his people, the Prophet confirms the same
   truth, that the mount of the house would be as the high places of a
   forest. And, by way of concession, he calls it the mount of the house,
   that is, of the temple; as though he said, "Though God had chosen to
   himself a habitation, in which to dwell, yet this favor shall not keep
   the temple from being deserted and laid waste; for it has been profaned
   by your wickedness."

   Let us now see at what time Micah delivered this prophecy. This we
   learn from Jeremiah 26; for when Jeremiah prophesied against the
   temple, he was immediately seized and cast into prison; a tumultuous
   council was held, and he was well nigh being brought forth unto
   execution. All the princes condemned him; and when now he had no hope
   of deliverance, he wished, not so much to plead his own cause, as to
   denounce a threatening on them, that they might know that they could
   effect no good by condemning an innocent man. "Micah, the Morasthite,"
   he said, "prophesied in the days of Hezekiah, and said thus, Zion as a
   field shall be plowed, Jerusalem shall be a heap, and the mount of the
   house as the high placers of a forest.'" Did the king and the people,
   he said, consult together to kill him? Nay, but the king turned, and so
   God repented; that is, the Lord deferred his vengeance; for king
   Hezekiah humbly deprecated the punishment which had been denounced. We
   now then know with certainty the time.

   But it was strange that under such a holy king so many and so shameful
   corruptions prevailed, for he no doubt tried all he could to exercise
   authority over the people, and by his own example taught the judges
   faithfully and uprightly to discharge their office; but he was not
   able, with all his efforts, to prevent the Priests, and the Judges, and
   the Prophets, from being mercenaries. We hence learn how sedulously
   pious magistrates ought to labor, lest the state of the Church should
   degenerate; for however vigilant they may be, they can yet hardly, even
   with the greatest care, keep things (as mankind are so full of vices)
   from becoming very soon worse. This is one thing. And now the
   circumstance of the time ought to be noticed for another purpose: Micah
   hesitated not to threaten with such a judgment the temple and the city,
   though he saw that the king was endued with singular virtues. He might
   have thought thus with himself, "King Hezekiah labored strenuously in
   the execution of his high office: now if a reproof so sharp and so
   severe will reach his ears, he will either despond, or think me to be a
   man extremely rigid, or, it may be, he will become exasperated against
   sound doctrine." The Prophet might have weighed these things in his
   mind; but, nevertheless, he followed his true course in teaching, and
   there is no doubt but that his severity pleased the king, for we know
   that he was oppressed with great cares and anxieties, because he could
   not, by all his striving, keep within proper bounds his counselors, the
   priests and the prophets. He therefore wished to have God's servants as
   his helpers. And this is what pious magistrates always desire, that
   their toils may in some measure be alleviated by the aid of the
   ministers of the word; for when the ministers of the word only teach in
   a cold manner, and are not intent on reproving vices, the severity of
   the magistrates will be hated by the people. "Why, see, the ministers
   say nothing, and we hence conclude that they do not perceive so great
   evils; and yet the magistrates with the drawn sword inflict new
   punishments daily." When, therefore, teachers are thus silent, a
   greater odium no doubt is incurred by the magistrates: it is hence, as
   I have said, a desirable thing for them, that the free reproofs of
   teachers should be added to the punishments and judgments of the law.

   We further see how calm and meek was the spirit of the king, that he
   could bear the great severity of the Prophet: Behold, he said, on your
   accounts etc.: "Thou oughtest at least to have excepted" me." For the
   king was not himself guilty. Why then did he connect him with the rest?
   Because the whole body was infected with contagion, and he spoke
   generally; and the good king did not retort nor even murmur, but, as we
   have recited from Jeremiah, he humbly deprecated the wrath of God, as
   though a part of the guilt belonged to him. Now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [110] "As the Masoretes, in their division of the Bible, reckon the
   Twelve Minor Prophets but as one Book, they mark this verse (twelfth of
   chapter 3) the middle verse of these Prophets." -- Adam Clarke.

   [111] Calvin has mercede in both instances. The first in Hebrew is
   schd, a gift, a bribe; this was given to the princes: and the second is
   mchyr, a commutation, barter, price, something in exchange; this was
   given to the priests: and then what was given to the prophets is
   literally silver, ksph; but it often means money in general. The
   Septuagint renders the first, meta doron -- for gifts; the second, meta
   misthou -- for reward; and the last, meta arguriou -- for money. The
   princes decided matters according to the bribes given them, the
   priests, not satisfied with the regular allowance given them according
   to the law, did not teach except they were paid, had something in
   exchange, a reward for their trouble. And while the true prophets, who
   were extraordinary teachers sent by God, delivered their messages
   freely, without any pay, as they received them; the false prophets, who
   pretended that they came from God, required money for performing their
   office; see Jeremiah 6:13. And notwithstanding all their gains, all
   things were done badly. Money was extracted for doing wrong. The
   princes determined cases unjustly, the priests taught erroneous
   doctrine, and the prophets prophesied falsely: and yet for all these
   evils, money was required! How ignorant and infatuated the people must
   have been! Cocceius enumerated six things as chargeable on the persons
   mentioned in this verse: 1. Avarice--the seeking of wealth instead of
   doing God's will; 2. A mercenary disposition, influenced by gain and
   not by sense of duty; 3. The exacting of unlawful reward; 4. The doing,
   even for reward, of what was evil and wicked; 5. A false pretense of
   trust in God; and, 6. The tying of God's favor to external privileges.
   -- Ed.

   [112] In unison with the foregoing are these striking remarks of
   Henry,--"Many are rocked sleep in a fatal security by their church
   privileges, as if these would protect them in sin and shelter them from
   punishment, which are really, and will be, the greatest aggravations
   both of their sin and of their punishment. If men's having the Lord
   among them will not restrain them from doing evil, it can never secure
   them from suffering evil for so doing; and it is very absurd for
   sinners to think that their impudence will be their impunity." -- Ed.

   [113] That is, the promise from repentance. -- Ed.

   Chapter 4
     __________________________________________________________________

   Micah 4:1-2

   1. But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the
   house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains, and
   it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it.

   1. Accidet ultimis diebus, ut sit mons domus Jehovae dispositus in
   capite montium, et extollentur ipse prae sublimitatibus; et venient ad
   eum populi:

   2. And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the
   mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will
   teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall
   go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.

   2. Et proficiscentur gentes multae et dicent, Venite, et ascendemus ad
   montem Jehovae, et ad domum Dei Jacob; et docebit nos de viis suis, et
   ambulabimus in semitis ejus; quia ex Sion prodibit lex, et verbum
   Jehovae ex Jerusalem.


   Here Micah begins his address to the faithful, who were a remnant among
   that people; for though the infection had nearly extended over the
   whole body, there were yet a few, we know, who sincerely worshipped
   God. Hence Micah, that he might not dishearten God's children by
   extreme terror, reasonably adds what we have now heard, -- that though
   for a time the temple would be demolished and laid waste, it would yet
   be only for a season, for the Lord would be again mindful of his
   covenant. When, therefore, the Prophet had hitherto spoken of God's
   dreadful vengeance, he directed his discourse to the whole people and
   to the princess; but now, especially, and as it were apart, addresses
   the pious and sincere servants of God; as though he said, "There is now
   a reason why I should speak to the few: I have hitherto spoken of the
   near judgment of God on the king's counselors, the priests and the
   prophets; in short, on the whole community, because they are all become
   wicked and ungodly; a contempt of God and an irreclaimable obstinacy
   have pervaded the whole body. Let them therefore have what they have
   deserved. But now I address the children of God by themselves, for I
   have something to say to them."

   For though the Prophet publicly proclaimed this promise, there is yet
   no doubt but that he had regard only to the children of God, for others
   were not capable of receiving this consolation; nay, he had shortly
   before condemned the extreme security of hypocrites, inasmuch as they
   leaned upon God; that is, relied on a false pretense of religion, in
   thinking that they were redeemed by a lawful price when they had
   offered their sacrifices. And we know that we meet with the same thing
   in the writings of the Prophets, and that it is a practice common among
   them to add consolations to threatening, not for the sake of the whole
   people, but to sustain the faithful in their hope, who would have
   despaired, had not a helping hand been stretched forth to them: for the
   faithful, we know, tremble, as soon as God manifests any token of
   wrath; for the more any one is touched with the fear of God, the more
   he dreads his judgment, and fears on account of his threatening. We
   hence see how necessary it is to moderate threatenings and terrors,
   when prophets and teachers have a regard to the children of God; for,
   as I have said, they are without these fearful enough. Let us then know
   that Micah has hitherto directed his discourse to the wicked despisers
   of God, who yet put on the cloak of religion; but now he turns his
   address to the true and pious worshipers of God. And he further so
   addresses the faithful of his age, that his doctrine especially belongs
   to us now; for how has it been, that the kingdom of God has been
   propagated through all parts of the earth? How has it been, that the
   truth of the gospel has come to us, and that we are made partakers with
   the ancient people of the same adoption, except that this prophecy has
   been fulfilled? Then the calling of the Gentiles, and consequently our
   salvation, is included in this prophecy.

   But the Prophet says, And it shall be in the extremity of days, [114]
   that the mount of the house of Jehovah shall be set in order [115] on
   the top of mountains The extremity of days the Prophet no doubt calls
   the coming of Christ, for then it was that the Church of God was built
   anew; in short, since it was Christ that introduced the renovation of
   the world, his advent is rightly called a new age; and hence it is also
   said to be the extremity of days: and this mode of expression very
   frequently occurs in Scripture; and we know that the time of the gospel
   is expressly called the last days and the last time by John, (John
   2:18,) as well as by the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, (Hebrews
   1:2,) and also by Paul, (2 Timothy 3:1;) and this way of speaking they
   borrowed from the prophets. On this subject some remarks were made on
   Joel 2. Paul gives us the reason for this mode of speaking in 1
   Corinthians 10:11: "Upon whom," he says, "the ends of the world are
   come." As Christ then brought in the completion of all things at his
   coming, the Prophet rightly says that it would be the last days when
   God would restore his Church by the hand of the Redeemer. At the same
   time, Micah no doubt intended to intimate that the time of God's wrath
   would not be short, but designed to show that its course would be for a
   long time.

   It shall then be in the last of days; that is, when the Lord shall have
   executed his vengeance by demolishing the temple, by destroying the
   city, and by reducing the holy place into a solitude, this dreadful
   devastation shall continue, not for one year, nor for two; in a word,
   it will not remain only for forty or fifty years, but the Lord will let
   loose the reins of his wrath, that their minds may long languish, and
   that no restoration may be evident. We now then understand the
   Prophet's design as to the last days.

   He calls the mount, the mount of the house of Jehovah, [116] in a sense
   different from what he did before; for then it was, as we have stated
   by way of concession; and now he sets forth the reason why God did not
   wish wholly to cast aside that mount; for he commanded his temple to be
   built there. It is the same, then, as though he said, -- "This ought
   not to be ascribed to the holiness of the mountain, as if it excelled
   other mountains in dignity; but because there the temple was founded,
   not by the authority of men, but by a celestial oracle, as it is
   sufficiently known."

   The mount then of the house of Jehovah shall be set in order on the top
   of the mountains, that is it shall surpass in height all other
   mountains; and it shall be raised, he says, above the highest summits,
   and assemble [117] there shall all nations. It is certain, that by
   these words of the Prophet is to be understood no visible eminence of
   situation: for that mount was not increased at the coming of Christ;
   and they who lived in the time of the Prophet entertained no gross idea
   of this kind. But he speaks here of the eminence of dignity, -- that
   God would give to mount Zion a distinction so eminent, that all other
   mountains would yield to its honor. And how was this done? The
   explanation follows in the next verse. Lest, then, any one thought that
   there would be some visible change in mount Zion, that it would
   increase in size, the Prophet immediately explains what he meant and
   says, at the end of the verse, Come shall nations to God. It is now
   easy to see what its elevation was to be, -- that God designed this
   mount to be, as it were, a royal seat. As under the monarchy of the
   king of Persia, the whole of the east, we know, was subject to one
   tower of the Persian; so also, when mount Zion became the seat of
   sovereign power, God designed to reign there, and there he designed
   that the whole world should be subject to him; and this is the reason
   and the Prophet said that it would be higher than all other mountains.
   Hence his meaning, in this expression, is sufficiently evident.

   There follows, however, a fuller explanation, when he says, that many
   nations would come He said only before that nations would come: but as
   David, even in his age, made some nations tributary to himself, the
   Prophet here expresses something more, -- that many nations would come;
   as if he had said, "Though David subjugated some people to himself, yet
   the borders of his kingdom were narrow and confined, compared with the
   largeness of that kingdom which the Lord will establish at the coming
   of his Messiah: for not a few nations but many shall assemble to serve
   him, and shall say," etc. The Prophet now shows that it would be a
   spiritual kingdom. When David subdued the Moabites and the Amorites,
   and others, he imposed a certain tribute to be paid annually but he was
   not able to establish among them the pure and legitimate worship of
   God, nor was he able to unite them in one faith. Then the Moabites and
   other nations, though they paid a tribute to David, did not yet worship
   the true God, but continued ever alienated from the Church. But our
   Prophet shows that the kingdom, which God would set up at the coming of
   the Messiah, would be spiritual.

   For they shall say, [118] Let us you and ascend to the mount of
   Jehovah, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of
   his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for, go [119] forth shall a
   law from Zion, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem Throughout this
   passage the Prophet teaches us, that people are not to be constrained
   by an armed force, or by the power of the sword, to submit to David's
   posterity, but that they are to be really and thoroughly reformed, so
   that they submit themselves to God, unite with the body of the Church,
   and become one people with the children of Abraham; for they will yield
   a voluntary service, and embracing the teaching of the Law, they will
   renounce their own superstitions. This then is the Prophet's meaning.
   But the remainder we shall defer till to-morrow.

   and not Micah, was the copyist; but the words, with which the passage
   is introduced in Isaiah, forbid such a supposition. "Bishop Lowth, on
   Isaiah 2:2, thinks that Micah took this passage from Isaiah. It is true
   that he has improved it after the manner of imitators. Or, the Spirit
   may have inspired both with this prediction: or both may have copied
   some common original, the words of a Prophet well known at the time. --
   Newcome.

   [118] Marckius says, "corde, ore, et opere -- with the heart, mouth,
   and in deed."

   [119] ky, ki, for, or because: what follows contains the reason for the
   preceding promise. How could it be, that the mount of the house of
   Jehovah should be firmly fixed on the top of mountains, etc.? The
   answer is here given, "for go forth shall a law from Zion," etc. And
   this was literally fulfilled at the commencement of the Gospel; it was
   first preached at Jerusalem: in consequence of this, the mount of
   Jehovah's house, or the Church, was formed; and what is here predicted
   was in part fulfilled, and will no doubt be hereafter more completely
   fulfilled. It is said, "on top of the mountains," not of a mountain.
   The Church was not to be confined to one place, but was to be
   preeminent throughout the earth. It was to be coextensive with the word
   that was to go forth from Zion. -- Ed.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God that as thou hast been pleased to erect the throne
   of thy Son among us, we may rely on his protection and learn to resign
   ourselves wholly to thee, and never turn aside here and there, but with
   tulle obedience so submit ourselves to the King who has been appointed
   by thee, that he may own us as his legitimate people, and so glorify
   thy name, that we may not at the same time profane it by an ungodly and
   wicked life, but testify by our works that we are really thy subjects.
   and that thou attains full authority over us, so that thy name may be
   sanctified and thy Spirit may really guide us, until at length thy Son,
   who has gathered us when we were awfully gone astray, gather us again
   to that kingdom, which he as purchased for us by his own blood. Amen.

   Lecture Eighty-eighth

   We began yesterday to explain the prophecy, in which Micah promises the
   restoration of the Church. We have said that this promise cannot be
   understood except of Christ's kingdom, for it refers to the last days.
   And it was also added, that the superiority and eminence of mount Zion,
   of which he speaks, cannot be otherwise understood than of God's
   spiritual kingdom; for the explanation follows, when he says, that many
   nations would come to be taught in the ways of the Lord. We hence see
   that an earthly empire is not what is here predicted, but what exists
   through the word and celestial doctrine. But each particular ought to
   be considered by us. We yesterday said, that in the distinct mention
   made of many nations, there is to be understood a contrast; for till
   that time God was only known by one people. Since God then had chosen
   the race of Abraham alone, there is here pointed out a future change,
   when he shall gather his Church from various nations, so as to do away
   with the difference between the Gentiles and the Jews.

   It now follows, They shall say, Come, and let us ascend to the mount of
   Jehovah The Prophet shows in these words that not only each one would
   be obedient to God, when called, but that they would also encourage one
   another: and this ardor is what is justly required in the faithful;
   they ought to animate and stir on one another; for it is not enough for
   each of us himself to obey God, but this zeal ought to be added, by
   which we may strive to produce a mutual benefit. This concern then is
   what the Prophet now refers to, when he says, "Come, that we may ascend
   to the mountain of the Lord." He might have said, that people would
   come, and there close his sentence; but he wished to join the two
   clauses, -- that they, who had before despised the God of Israel, would
   come from all parts, -- and also that they would become exhorters to
   one another. Come then that we may ascend. But the manner of the
   exhortation deserves to be noticed; for each one offers himself as a
   companion in the journey. We indeed see that many are prompt enough,
   when others are to be stimulated in their duty; but they at the same
   time lie still; their whole fervor is consumed in sending others, and
   they themselves move not, no, not a finger; so far are they from
   running with alacrity in company with others. The Prophet shows here,
   that the faithful will be so solicitous about the salvation of their
   brethren that they will strenuously run themselves, and that they will
   prescribe nothing to others but what they themselves perform. Come then
   that we may ascend; they say not, "Go, ascend to the mount of Jehovah;"
   but, Let us go together." It is then the right way of encouraging, when
   we really show that we require nothing from our brethren but what we
   desire to do ourselves.

   The circumstance of time must now be noticed; for what the Prophet says
   respecting the nations coming into mount Zion, as it was to be reduced
   to a waste, might have appeared a fable; for what had he shortly before
   predicted? That Zion would be plowed as a field, and that trees would
   grow there, that it would become a wild forest. How then could it be,
   that many nations would flow to it as to a most renowned place, as it
   was to be reduced to a dreadful desolation? But the Prophet here extols
   the wonderful power of God, -- that in this wild and desert place there
   would at length be raised a noble and a celebrated temple, where God
   would show mercy to his own people. Hence he promises what this mount
   of Jehovah would be, which was for a time to be forsaken; and that
   there would be, as formerly, a noble temple in the place, where
   desolation had for a season existed.

   It afterwards follows, And he will teach us of his ways. [120] Here the
   Prophet in a few words defines the legitimate worship of God: for it
   would not be sufficient for the nations to come together into one place
   to profess the one true God, unless true obedience followed, which
   rests on faith, as faith does on the word. It ought then to be
   especially noticed, that the Prophet sets here the word of God before
   us, in order to show that true religion is founded on the obedience of
   faith, and that God cannot be truly worshipped, except when he himself
   teaches his people, and prescribes to them what is necessary to be
   done. Hence when the will of God is revealed to us, we then can truly
   worship him. When the word is again taken away, there will indeed be
   some form of divine worship; but there will be no genuine religion,
   such as is pleasing to God. And hence we also learn, that there is no
   other way of raising up the Church of God than by the light of the
   word, in which God himself, by his own voice, points out the way of
   salvation. Until then the truth shines, men cannot be united together,
   so as to form a true Church.

   Since it is so, it follows, that where the truth is either corrupted or
   despised, there is no religion, at least such as is approved by God.
   Men may indeed boast of the name with their lips: but there is no true
   religion before God, except it be formed according to the rule of his
   word. It hence also follows, that there is no Church, except it be
   obedient to the word of God, and be guided by it: for the prophet
   defines here what true religion is, and also how God collects a Church
   for himself. He will then teach us of his ways And a third particular
   may be added, -- that God is robbed of his right and of his honor, when
   mortals assume to themselves the authority to teach; for it is to God
   alone that this office of teaching his people can strictly be ascribed.
   (proprie tribuitur.) There were then priests and prophets, yet Micah
   here brings them down to their proper state, and shows that the right
   and the office of teaching would be in the power of the only true God.
   We hence see that God claims this office for himself, that we may not
   be tossed to and fro, and led astray by various teachers, but continue
   in simple obedience to his word, so that he alone may be the Supreme.
   In short, God is not the God and Head of the Church, except he be the
   chief and the only Teacher.

   Wheat he now says, "He will teach us of his ways," ought to be thus
   understood. He will teach us what his ways are; as though the Prophet
   had said, that the perfect wisdom of men is to understand what pleases
   God, and what is his will: for there is nothing farther to be learnt.

   It follows, And we will walk in his paths. By this clause we are
   reminded, that the truth of God is not, as they say, speculative, but
   full of energizing power. God then not only speaks to the end that
   every one may acknowledge that to be true which proceeds from him, but
   at the same time he demands obedience. Hence we shall then only be the
   disciples of God, when we walk in his ways: for if we only nod with our
   ears, as asses are wont to do, and assent to what God says with our
   mouth and lips, it is extremely vain and absurd. It is therefore then
   only that men really profit under the teaching of God, when they form
   their life according to his doctrine, and be prepared with their feet
   to walk, and to follow whithersoever be may call them. We will then
   walk in his paths

   Micah had hitherto related only what the faithful would do; he now
   himself confirms the same truth, For from Zion shall go forth a law,
   [121] and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem. Here is a reason given
   why many nations would come to the temple of the Lord; and that is,
   because a doctrine would be then promulgated, which had been before
   heard only in one place. We indeed know that the Jews came to the
   temple, not only to worship, but also to be instructed in the Law of
   God. The Law then had at that time, as it were, its habitation in Zion:
   there was the sanctuary of celestial wisdom. But what does our Prophet
   say? A law shall go forth from Zion, that is, it shall be proclaimed
   far and wide: the Lord will show, not only in one corner, what true
   religion is, and how he seeks to be worshipped, but he will send forth
   his voice to the extreme limits of the earth. A law then shall go forth
   from Zion, according to what is said in Psalm 110,

   the scepter of thy power the Lord will send forth from Zion.'

   In that passage the doctrine of Christ is metaphorically called a
   scepter, or is compared to a royal scepter; for Christ does not
   otherwise rule among us, than by the doctrine of his Gospel: and there
   David declares, that this scepter would be sent far abroad by God the
   Father, that Christ might have under his rule all those nations which
   had been previously aliens. Such is the meaning in this place, A law
   from Zion shall go forth Then it follows, The word of Jehovah from
   Jerusalem This is a repetition of the same sentiment, which is often
   the case. Then by tvrh, ture, the Prophet means no other thing than
   doctrine: but, by another term, he confirms the same thing, that is
   that God would be heard not only at Jerusalem and in Judea, but that he
   would make his word to be proclaimed everywhere. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [120] Both Newcome and Henderson render the v, vau, here, that, "that
   he may teach us," etc.: but it is better to retrain the most common
   meaning as a simple copulative, as it is done in our version, and by
   Calvin, and by Lowth in Isaiah. The passage thus runs better, and more
   emphatically expresses the language of faith. -- Ed.

   [121] So Newcome renders it; Lowth and Henderson read the same with our
   version, "the law." The absence of the definite article is certainly no
   objection, as it is but seldom used in Hebrew. But "a law" is better
   except we render the copulative before "word," even; and then we shall
   destroy the distinct character of the line. It appears that, according
   to the usual style of the Prophets, what the first line states
   indefinitely, is in the second specified, as being the "word of
   Jehovah." The word tvrh, law, in Hebrew, is more comprehensive than the
   word law, in our language. It is derived from the Hiphil of yrh, which
   means to direct, to appoint, to instruct, to teach. Hence the noun,
   tvrh, may be rendered, directory, institution, law, teaching, or
   doctrine. "It doth," says Leigh, "not only signify strictly what is to
   be done, but it denoteth largely any heavenly doctrine, whether it be
   promise or precept." It means often the whole of God's revealed word,
   as in Psalm 1:2; Psalm 119:174, etc. See Joshua 1:8. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Micah 4:3

   3. And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar
   off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears
   into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation,
   neither shall they learn war any more.

   3. Et judicabit inter populos multos, et arguet (vel, corripiet) gentes
   robustos usque in longinquum, et concident gladios suos in vomeres, et
   lanceas suas in falces: non tollent gens contra gentem gladium, et non
   assuescent ultra praelio.


   The Prophet here describes the fruit of Divine truth, -- that God would
   restore all nations to such gentleness, that they would study to
   cultivate fraternal peace among themselves, and that all would consult
   the good of others, having laid aside every desire for doing harm. As
   then he has lately showed, that the Church of God could not be
   otherwise formed than by the Word, and that the legitimate worship of
   God cannot be set up and continued, except where God is honored with
   the obedience of faith; so now he shows that Divine truth produces this
   effect, -- that they, who before lived in enmity towards one another
   and burned with the lust of doing harm, being full of cruelty and
   avarice, will now, having their disposition changed, devote themselves
   wholly to acts of kindness. But, before the Prophet comes to this
   subject, he says, --

   He will judge [122] among many people, and will reprove strong nations.
   The word judge, in Hebrew, means the same as to rule or govern. It is
   certain that God is spoken of here: it is then the same as though the
   Prophet had said that though the nations had not hitherto obeyed God,
   they would now own him as king and submit to his government. God has
   indeed ever governed the world by his hidden providence, as he does
   still govern it: for how much soever the devil and the ungodly may
   rage; nay, how ever much they may boil with unbridled fury, there is no
   doubt but that God restrains and checks their madness by his hidden
   bridle. But the Scripture speaks of God's kingdom in two respects. God
   does indeed govern the devil and all the wicked, but not by his word,
   nor by the sanctifying power of his Spirit: it is so done, that they
   obey God, not willingly, but against their will. The peculiar
   government of God is that of his Church only, where, by his word and
   Spirit, He bends the hearts of men to obedience, so that they follow
   him voluntarily and willingly, being taught inwardly and outwardly, --
   inwardly by the influence of the Spirit, -- outwardly by the preaching
   of the word. Hence it is said in Psalm 110, Thy willing people shall
   then assemble.' This is the government that is here described by the
   Prophet; God then shall judge; not as he judges the world, but he will,
   in a peculiar manner, make them obedient to himself so that they will
   look for nothing else than to be wholly devoted to him.

   But as men must first be subdued before they render to God such
   obedience, the Prophet expressly adds, And he will reprove (corripiet)
   or convince (arguet) many people. And this sentence ought to be
   carefully noticed; for we hence learn, that such is our innate pride,
   that not one of us can become a fit disciple to God, except we be by
   force subdued. Truth then would of itself freeze amidst such corruption
   as we have, except the Lord proved us guilty, except he prepared us
   beforehand, as it were, by violent measures. We now then perceive the
   design of the Prophet in connecting reproof with the government of God:
   for the verb ykch, ikech, signifies sometimes to expostulate, to
   convince, and sometimes to correct or reprove. [123] In short, the
   wickedness and perversity of our flesh are here implied; for even the
   best of us would never offer themselves to God, without being first
   subdued, and that by God's powerful correction. This, then, is the
   beginning of the kingdom of Christ.

   But when he says, that strong nations would be reproved, he hereby
   eulogizes and sets forth the character of the kingdom of which he
   speaks: and we hence learn the power of truth, -- that strong men, when
   thus reproved, shall offer themselves, without any resistance, to be
   ruled by God. Correction is indeed necessary, but God employs no
   external force, nor any armed power, when he makes the Church subject
   to himself: and yet he collects strong nations. Hence then is seen the
   power of truth: for where there is strength, there is confidence and
   arrogance, and also rebellious opposition. Since then the Lord, without
   any other helps, thus corrects the perverseness of men, we hence see
   with what inconceivable power God works, when he gathers his own
   Church. It is to be added, that there is not the least doubt, but that
   this is to be applied to the person of Christ. Micah speaks of God,
   without mentioning Christ by name; for he was not yet manifested in the
   flesh: but we know that in his person has this been fulfilled, -- that
   God has governed the universe, and subjected to himself the people of
   the whole world. We hence conclude that Christ is true God; for he is
   not only a minister to the Father, as Moses, or any one of the
   Prophets; but he is the supreme King of his Church.

   Before I proceed to notice the fruit, the expression, rchvq d, od
   rechuk, "afar off" must be observed. It may intimate a length of time
   as well as distance of place. Jonathan applies it to a long continuance
   of time, -- that God would convince men to the end of the world. But
   the Prophet, I doubt not, intended to include the most distant
   countries; as though he had said, that God would not be the king of one
   people only, or of Judea alone, but that his kingdom would be
   propagated to the extremities of the earth. He will then convince
   people afar off

   He afterward adds, with respect to the fruit, They shall beat their
   swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks I have
   already briefly explained the meaning of the Prophet: he in fact shows
   that when the nations should be taught by the word of God, there would
   be such a change, that every one would study to do good, and to perform
   the duties of love towards his neighbors. But by speaking of swords and
   spears he briefly intimates, what men, until they are made gentle by
   the word of the Lord, are ever intent on iniquitous tyranny and
   oppression; nor can it be otherwise, while every one follows his own
   nature; for there are none who are not wedded to their own advantages,
   and the cupidity of men is insatiable. As then all are thus intent on
   gain, while every one is blinded by self-love, what but cruelty must
   ever break forth from this wicked principle? Hence then it is, that men
   cannot cultivate peace with one another; for every one seeks to be the
   first, and draws every thing to himself; no one will willingly give
   way: then dissensions arise, and from dissensions, fightings. This is
   what the Prophet intimates. And then he adds, that the fruit of the
   doctrine of Christ would however be such, that men, who were before
   like cruel wild beasts, would become gentle and meek. Forge then shall
   they their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks.

   Raise, he says, shall not a nation a sword against a nation, and
   accustom themselves they shall no more to war He explains here more
   fully what I have before said, -- that the Gospel of Christ would be to
   the nations, as it were, a standard of peace: as when a banner is
   raised up, soldiers engage in battle, and their fury is kindled; so
   Micah ascribes a directly opposite office to the Gospel of Christ, --
   that it will restore those to the cultivation of peace and concord, who
   before were given to acts of hostility. For when he says, Raise a sword
   shall not a nation against nation,' he intimates, as I have already
   stated, that wherever Christ does not reign, men are wolves to men, for
   every one is disposed to devour all others. Hence as men are naturally
   impelled by so blind an impulse, the Prophet declares, that this
   madness cannot be corrected, that men will not cease from wars, that
   they will not abstain from hostilities, until Christ becomes their
   teacher: for by the word lmd, lamed, he implies, that it is a practice
   which ever prevails among mankind, that they contend with one another,
   that they are ever prepared to do injuries and wrongs, except when they
   put off their natural disposition. But gentleness, whence does it
   proceed? Even from the teaching of the Gospel.

   This passage ought to be remembered; for we here learn, that there is
   not growing among us the real fruit of the Gospel, unless we exercise
   mutual love and benevolence, and exert ourselves in doing good. Though
   the Gospel is at this day purely preached among us, when yet we
   consider how little progress we make in brotherly love, we ought justly
   to be ashamed of our indolence. God proclaims daily that he is
   reconciled to us in his Son; Christ testifies, that he is our peace
   with God, that he renders him propitious to us, for this end, that we
   may live as brethren together. We indeed wish to be deemed the children
   of God, and we wish to enjoy the reconciliation obtained for us by the
   blood of Christ; but in the meantime we tear one another, we sharpen
   our teeth, our dispositions are cruel. If then we desire really to
   prove ourselves to be the disciples of Christ, we must attend to this
   part of divine truth, each of us must strive to do good to his
   neighbors. But this cannot be done without being opposed by our flesh;
   for we have a strong propensity to self-love, and are inclined to seek
   too much our own advantages. We must therefore put off these inordinate
   and sinful affections, that brotherly kindness may succeed in their
   place.

   We are also reminded that it is not enough for any one to refrain from
   doing harm, unless he be also occupied in doing good to his brethren.
   The Prophet might indeed have said only They shall break their swords
   and their spears; so that they shall hereafter abstain from doing any
   hurt to others: this only is not what he says; but, "They shall forge,"
   or beat," their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning
   hooks;" that is, when they shall abstain from all injuries they will
   seek to exercise themselves in the duties of love, consistently with
   what Paul says, when he exhorts those who had stolen to steal no more,
   but to work with their own hands, that they might relieve others
   (Ephesians 4:28.) Except then we endeavor to relieve the necessities of
   our brethren, and to offer them assistance, there will not be in us but
   one part of true conversion, as the case is with many, who are not
   indeed inhuman, who commit no plunder, who give no occasion for
   complaint, but they live to themselves, and enjoy unprofitable leisure.
   This indolence the Prophet here indirectly condemns, when he speaks of
   the plowshares and the pruning hooks.

   Again, a question may be here asked, -- Was this fulfilled at the
   coming of Christ? It seems that the Prophet does not describe here the
   state of the Church for a time, but shows what would be the kingdom of
   Christ to the end. But we see, that when the Gospel was at first
   preached, the whole world boiled with wars more than ever; and now,
   though the Gospel in many parts is clearly preached, yet discords and
   contentions do not cease; we also see that rapacity, ambition, and
   insatiable avarice, greatly prevail; and hence arise contentions and
   bloody wars. And at the same time it would have been inconsistent in
   the Prophet to have thus spoken of the kingdom of Christ, had not God
   really designed to perform what is here predicted. My answer to this
   is, -- that as the kingdom of Christ was only begun in the world, when
   God commanded the Gospel to be everywhere proclaimed, and as at this
   day its course is not as yet completed; so that which the Prophet says
   here has not hitherto taken place; but inasmuch as the number of the
   faithful is small, and the greater part despise and reject the Gospel,
   so it happens, that plunders and hostilities continue in the world. How
   so? Because the Prophet speaks here only of the disciples of Christ. He
   shows the fruit of his doctrine, that wherever it strikes a living
   root, it brings forth fruit: but the doctrine of the Gospel strikes
   roots hardly in one out of a hundred. [124] The measure also of its
   progress must be taken to the account; for so far as any one embraces
   the doctrine of the Gospel, so far he becomes gentle and seeks to do
   good to his neighbors. But as we as yet carry about us the relics of
   sin in our flesh, and as our knowledge of the Gospel is not yet
   perfect, it is no wonder, that not one of us has hitherto wholly laid
   aside the depraved and sinful affections of his flesh.

   It is also easy hence to see, how foolish is the conceit of those, who
   seek to take away the use of the sword, on account of the Gospel. The
   Anabaptists, we know, have been turbulent, as though all civil order
   were inconsistent with the kingdom of Christ, as though the kingdom of
   Christ was made up of doctrine only, and that doctrine without any
   influence. We might indeed do without the sword, were we angels in this
   world; but the number of the godly, as I have already said, is small;
   it is therefore necessary that the rest of the people should be
   restrained by a strong bridle; for the children of God are found mixed
   together, either with cruel monsters or with wolves and rapacious men.
   Some are indeed openly rebellious, others are hypocrites. The use of
   the sword will therefore continue to the end of the world.

   We must now understand that at the time our Prophet delivered this
   discourse, Isaiah had used the very same words, (Isaiah 2:4:) and it is
   probable that Micah was a disciple of Isaiah. They, however, exercised
   at the same time the Prophetic office, though Isaiah was the oldest.
   But Micah was not ashamed to follow Isaiah and to borrow his words; for
   he was not given to self ostentation, as though he would not adduce any
   thing but what was his own; but he designedly adopted the expressions
   of Isaiah, and related verbally what he had said, to show that there
   was a perfect agreement between him and that illustrious minister of
   God, that his doctrine might obtain more credit. We hence see how great
   was the simplicity of our Prophet, and that he did not regard what
   malevolent and perverse men might say: "What! he only repeats the words
   of another." Such a calumny he wholly disregarded; and he thought it
   enough to show that he faithfully declared what God had commanded.
   Though we have not the d rchyq, od rechuk, in Isaiah, yet the meaning
   is the same: in all other things they agree. It now follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [122] There is a difference of opinion as to the nominative case to the
   verb "judge;" whether it be Jehovah in the preceding line, or the word
   of Jehovah. The most natural construction is the last supposition.
   Jerome and Cyril, as quoted by Marckius, refer it to the word of
   Jehovah, taking the word for Christ: but this cannot be admitted, as
   the law and the word seem to mean the same thing, and must be
   considered as the word of the Gospel; and Justin Martyr and Irenaeus,
   when referring to this passage regard it as such. And this is the view
   which Marckius seems to prefer. The rendering then would be, -- And it
   shall judge among many people,
   And convince strong nations afar off.

   [123] The two verbs here used are spht, to judge, and hvkych, in
   Hiphil, to reprove. The first is to decide what is right and wrong, and
   also to defend the right and to punish the wrong; hence it means to
   arbitrate, and also to vindicate as well as to punish. The first sense
   is most suitable to this place. -- The other verb does not occur in
   Kal, but in Hiphil, it means to make manifest, or show, by facts or by
   words, or by action; and hence it signifies to demonstrate, to
   convince, to reprove, to chastise. The Septuagint often renders it by
   elenchein, which, Parkhurst says, means, in its primary sense, to
   demonstrate by convincing reasons or arguments. Lowth's version in
   Isaiah is, "And shall work conviction," etc. Newcome renders it
   "convince." The rendering of Henderson, "give decision," is not to be
   approved. See John 16:8. -- Ed.

   [124] "All these predictions must be confined to the nations converted
   by the word of Jehovah, and brought into Zion, that is, such as truly
   repent and believe, and must not be extended to all nations
   indiscriminately, or to all who embrace the Christian name, who are
   often as far as possible from the kingdom of Christ, inasmuch as they
   neither learn nor follow his doctrine. -- Marckius.

   Micah 4:4

   4. But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree;
   and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the Lord of hosts
   hath spoken it

   4. Et sedebunt (hoc est, quiescent, vel, quieti habitabunt) quisque sub
   vite sua et sub ficn sua; et nemo erit qui exterreat; quia os Jehovae
   exercituum loquutum est.


   Micah goes on here with the same subject, -- that when the minds of men
   shall be disposed to acts of kindness, every one shall enjoy God's
   blessing without being disturbed. There seems indeed to be two things
   here included, -- that acts of hostility shall cease, -- and that real
   happiness cannot exist among men, except Christ rules among them by the
   doctrine of his Gospel. And the same thing the prophets teach
   elsewhere, that is, that every one shall live without fear; and this
   they do, in order to show that men ever live in a miserable dread,
   except when they are safe under the protection of God. It is the same
   thing as though the Prophet had said, that the life of men is most
   miserable, where the doctrine of the Gospel is not had, inasmuch as
   when they are disturbed by continual disquietude, every one fears for
   himself, every one suffers constant terrors. There is nothing more
   miserable than such a state of things, for peace is the chief good.

   We now then understand the meaning of the Prophet to be, -- that under
   the reign of Christ the faithful shall enjoy true and full happiness,
   as they shall be exempt from trembling and fear; hence he names the
   vine and the fig-tree. He might have said, "Every one shall live
   securely at home;" but he says, Every one shall rest under his own
   fig-tree and under his own vine; that is, though exposed to thieves, he
   shall yet fear no violence, no injury; for those who were thieves shall
   observe what is just and right; those who were bloody shall study to do
   good. Hence when no one closes the door of his house, yea, when he goes
   out into the fields and sleeps in the open air; he will still be safe
   and secure. We now then see why the Prophet mentions here the fig-tree
   and the vine, rather than the dwelling-house.

   And there will be no one to terrify them. What the Prophet designed to
   express is here more clearly specified, -- that there would be no
   danger, and that there would therefore be no need of hiding-places or
   of any defenses. Why? Because the very fields, he says, will be free
   from every thing that may hurt, as there will be none to cause fear.
   And the Prophet seems to allude to the blessing promised in the Law,
   for Moses used nearly the very same words: and the Prophets, we know,
   drew many things from the Law; for their design was to retain the
   people in its doctrine, and to render it as familiar as possible to
   them. As then Moses promised, among other things, this security,

   Ye shall sleep, and none shall terrify you,' (Leviticus 26:6;)

   so the Prophet also, in speaking here of the kingdom of Christ, shows
   that this blessing would be then fully accomplished.

   He now at last subjoins, The mouth of Jehovah hath thus spoken, that he
   might confirm what seemed incredible: for, as I have already said,
   since he had shortly before predicted the devastation of mount Zion and
   the ruin of the temple, it seemed very improbable that the nations
   would come there to worship God. But he declares that the mouth of God
   had thus spoken, that the faithful might overcome all obstacles and
   struggle against despair; though they saw the temple destroyed, the
   mount Zion desolated, though they saw a horrible waste and wild beasts
   occupying the place of men; they were yet to continue to entertain firm
   hope. -- How so? Because Jehovah has made a promise and he will fulfill
   it: for when mention is made of God's mouth, his omnipotence is to be
   understood by which will be executed whatever he has promised.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that since, at the coming of Christ thy Son, thou
   didst really perform what thy servants, the Prophets, had previously so
   much foretold, and since thou daily invites us to the unity of faith,
   that with united efforts we may truly serve thee, -- O grant, that we
   may not continue torn asunder, every one pursuing his own perverse
   inclinations, at a time when Christ is gathering us to thee; nor let us
   only profess with the mouth and in words, that we are under thy
   government, but prove that we thus feel in real sincerity and may we
   then add to the true and lawful worship of thy name brotherly love
   towards one another, that with united efforts we may promote each
   other's good, and that our adoption may thus be proved and be more and
   more confirmed, that we may ever be able with full confidence to call
   on thee as our Father through Christ our Lord. Amen.

   Micah 4:5

   5. For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we
   will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever.

   5. Quia omnes populi ambulabunt, quisque in nomine dei sui; nos autem
   ambulabimus in nomine Jehovae Dei nostri in seculum et usque.


   Micah, after having spoken of the restoration of the Church, now
   confirms the same truth, and shows that the faithful would have reason
   enough to cleave constantly to their God, and to despise all the
   superstitions of the world, and that though they may be tossed here and
   there by contrary opinions, they will yet continue in true religion.
   This verse then is connected with the kingdom of Christ; for until we
   are gathered, and Christ shines among us and rules us by his word,
   there can be in us no constancy, no firmness. But when under the
   auspices of Christ, we join together in one body the Church, such then
   becomes the constancy of our faith, that nothing can turn us from the
   right course, though new storms were at any time to arise, by which the
   whole world might be shaken, and though it were to happen that the
   universe should be agitated or pass away. We now understand what the
   Prophet means.

   He therefore says, All nations shall walk every one in the name of his
   god. This sentence must be thus explained, -- "Though nations be
   divided into various sects, and each be addicted to their own
   superstitions, yet we shall continue firm in the pure worship of God
   and in unity of faith." But this question occurs, how could the Prophet
   say that there would be such discords in the world, when he had shortly
   before spoken of the Church being gathered and united together? for he
   had said, Come shall all nations, and each will say, Come, let us
   ascend into the mount of Jehovah. There seems to be here some sort of
   inconsistency, -- that all nations would come to mount Zion, and yet
   that every people would have their own gods. But the solution is not
   difficult: the Prophet in this verse strengthens the faithful, until
   Christ should be revealed to the world: nor is there any doubt but the
   Prophet intended to sustain the confidence of the godly, who might have
   otherwise been overwhelmed a hundred times with despair. When the
   children of Israel were driven into exile, when their inheritance was
   taken away from them, when the temple had been demolished, when, in a
   word, no visible religion existed, they might, as I have said, have
   desponded, had not this promise come to their minds, -- that God would
   restore mount Zion, and gather a Church from the whole world. But there
   was also need of some confirmation, and this is what the Prophet now
   subjoins. Hence he says, "Since the Lord gives you hope of so glorious
   a restoration, you ought to feel confidence. and, in reliance on his
   promise, to continue in his true worship, how much soever the Gentiles
   may serve their own idols, and boast that they have the true God.
   However, then, every one of the nations may take pride in their
   superstitions, you ought not to fluctuate, nor turn here and there,
   like reeds, which are tossed to and fro, as the wind changes; but ye
   shall continue firm and steady in your course; for ye know that God is
   true, who has once for all adopted you, and has promised that your
   salvation will be the object of his care, even when the world shall
   think you to be ruined and lost."

   We hence see that what the Prophet had in view was to raise up into
   confidence the minds of the godly in the midst not only of troubles,
   but of utter confusion. All nations then shall walk, that is, when the
   temple and the city shall be demolished, and the people be led into
   distant exile, the ungodly will, at the same time, triumph, every one
   will extol his own gods: though our God should not then appear, there
   will yet be no reason why we should be discouraged; but we ought to
   recomb on his word. We shall then walk in the name of our God, and that
   for ever and ever; that is, though it should happen that the world
   should a hundred times be turned and turned over again, there shall yet
   be no change in our minds: for as the truth of God is eternal, so also
   our faith ought to be constant and never to vary. Now the difficulty is
   removed, and we see how these two things agree, -- that all nations
   shall come and with one consent worship God, and yet that to each of
   them there would be their own gods: for the diversity of time must be
   here regarded, when all nations would walk every one in the name of his
   god. [125]

   By saying, 'ys vsm 'lhyv, aish beshem Aleiu, he touches, in an indirect
   way, on that variety which exists among men. Though all of them
   pertinaciously follow and defend their own superstitions yet each one
   fabricates a goal for himself. Thus it happens, that nothing is
   certain, for they follow only their own inventions. But this the
   Prophet meant only to touch by the way. His main object was that which
   I have stated, -- that though the Church of God would be small, and
   should find a great multitude opposed to it, it ought not yet to
   succumb. We know how violent a thing is public consent; for when the
   majority conspire together, the small number, who entertain a different
   opinion, are, as it were instantly swallowed up. It is not then without
   reason that the Prophet exhorts the faithful here to an invincible
   firmness of mind, that they might triumph over all the nations. However
   small, then, might be the faithful in number, the Prophet wished them
   to look down, as it were from a higher place, not only on a large
   multitudes but on all mankind. Though then all nations walk, etc.: nor
   is the word kl, cal, all, superfluous, -- though all nations shall
   walk, etc. There was then but one nation, the offspring of Abraham,
   among whom true religion existed; and it was a dreadful devastation,
   when God suffered the royal city and the temple to be pulled down, and
   the whole body of the people to be torn asunder, to be driven away here
   and there, so that no kingdom and no kind of civil community remained.
   Hence the Prophet intimates here, that though the faithful should find
   that in number and dignity they were far surpassed by their enemies,
   they yet should not despair. "Though then all the nations walked, every
   one in the name of their god, -- though every people set up their
   superstitions against you, and all conspired against you together, yet
   stand ye firm and proceed in your course, and this not for a short
   time, but for ever and ever." [126] Now this passage shows that faith
   depends not on the suffrages of men, and that we ought not to regard
   what any one may think, or what may be the consent of all; for the
   truth of God alone ought to be deemed sufficient by us. How much
   soever, then, the whole world may oppose God, our faith ought not to be
   changeable, but remain firm on this strong foundation, -- that God, who
   cannot deceive, has spoken. This is one thing. Then, in the second
   place, it must be added, that this firmness ought to be perpetual.
   Though then Satan may excite against us new troubles, since we have
   hitherto stood firm as to our faith in God's word, let us proceed in
   the same course to the end. And the Prophet designedly added this
   verse; because he saw that the people would be subject to various and
   long-continued temptations. It was a long captivity: hence languor
   might have, as it were, wasted away all the confidence which the people
   then had. And further, after they returned from exile, we know how
   often and how grievously their faith was tried, when all their
   neighbors inimically assailed them, and when they were afterwards
   oppressed by cruel tyranny. This was the reason why the Prophet said
   that the children of God are to walk perpetually and to the end in his
   name

   Though he gives the name of gods to the idols of the nations he yet
   shows that there is a great and striking difference; for the nations
   worship their own gods, which they had invented: or how did they derive
   their majesty and their power, except from the false imagination of
   men? But the Prophet says, We will walk in the name of Jehovah our God.
   He hence shows that the power and authority of God is not founded on
   any vain device of men, for he of himself exists, and will exist,
   though he were denied by the whole world. And this also confirms what I
   have already stated, -- that the faithful ought thus to embrace the
   word of God, as they know that they have not to do with men, the credit
   of whom is doubtful and inconstant, but with him who is the true God,
   who cannot lie, and whose truth is immutable. Let us proceed --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [125] Marckius views this passage differently. He considers that the
   converted Gentiles are meant here, -- that when turned from their idols
   and their superstitions, they shall profess the true God, as revealed
   in the Gospel, and that each nation will regard him as its own God:
   however various in outward circumstances, they shall yet acknowledge
   the God revealed in his Word as their own. This view most certainly
   harmonizes better with the context than that of Calvin, which is
   commonly adopted. There is another, which is the same nearly in
   meaning, but founded on a different rendering of the words. The Jewish
   commentator Abarbanel, as quoted by Marckius, gives this version: --
   "Nam omnes populi, qui ambulabant quisque in nomine dei sui, et now
   ambulabimus in nomine Jehovae Dei nostri." The words will no doubt
   admit of this construction; for it is often the case in Hebrew, that
   'sr, who, is understood before a verb in the future tense, especially
   when it has the meaning of the present, as here, for the preceding
   "ambulabant," might be rendered "ambulant," without any inconstancy in
   the meaning. I would therefore render the verse thus, -- For all the
   nations,
   Who walk each in the name of its god,
   And we ourselves,
   Shall walk in the name of Jehovah our God,
   For ever and ever. The nations were then walking in the name of their
   multiplied gods; but at the time alluded to, both Gentiles and Jews
   would walk together in the name of Jehovah. There is thus an entire
   correspondence between all the parts of this remarkable passage, which
   extends from the first verse to the seventh inclusive; a part of which,
   extending only to the end of the third verse, is to be found in Isaiah.
   -- Ed.

   [126] lvlm vd, "for ages and perpetually." vlm means most commonly an
   indefinite, rather than an infinite time. The verb signifies to be
   hidden or concealed; and so the noun means an undefined and unknown
   period. "For ages," would perhaps be its best version; whether these
   ages be limited or unlimited must depend on the context. Here d is
   added to show that these ages would be endless, or to the end of time:
   for d is "still," unceasing futurity, that which is perpetual, still
   the same. The Levitical dispensation was lvlm "for ages," but the new
   state of things promised here is to be, not only for ages, but also
   perpetually, that is to the end of time, while the world lasts. -- Ed.

   Micah 4:6-7

   6. In that day, saith the Lord, will I assemble her that halteth, and I
   will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted;

   6. In die illa, inquit Jehova, colligam claudam, et ejectam congregabo,
   et quam malis afflixi;

   7. And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far
   off a strong nation: and the Lord shall reign over them in mount Zion
   from henceforth, even for ever.

   7. Et ponam claudam in reliquias, et ultra ejectam in gentem robustam;
   regnabit Jehova super eos in monte Sion ex nunc usque in seculum.


   The Prophet pursues the same subject. But we must ever remember what I
   have previously reminded you of, -- that the trials would be so
   grievous and violent that there would be need of strong and uncommon
   remedies; for the faithful might have been a hundred times sunk, as it
   were, in the deepest gulfs, except they had been supported by various
   means. This then is the reason why the Prophet confirms so fully the
   truth which we have noticed respecting the restoration of the Church.

   In that day, he says, I will gather the halting This metaphor is not
   only found here; for David sage that his own affliction was like that
   of halting. The word tslh, tsaloe, means the side: hence they
   metaphorically call those halters who walk only on one side: it is the
   same as though he had said, that they were maimed or weak. [127] He
   then adds, I will assemble the ejected, whom I have afflicted. In the
   next verse he repeats the same, I will make the halting, he says, a
   remnant; that is, I will make her who is now halting to remain alive,
   and her who is cast afar off, a strong nation. Some explain 'n'l'h,
   [128] enelae, in a more refined manner, and say that it means, She who
   is gone before; as though the Prophet said, God will sustain the
   halting, and to those who are lively he will add strength. But this
   exposition is too strained. We see that the context will not admit it;
   for the Prophet brings forward the Church here as afflicted by the hand
   of God, and nigh utter ruin: and then, on the other hand, he intimates,
   that it was to be restored by God's power, and that it would thereby
   gather new strength, and flourish as before: he therefore calls the
   Church as one cast far away, as in the previous verse; and the other
   verse clearly shows, that the Prophet's design was no other but to
   point out the twofold state of the Church.

   Now, in the first place, we must observe, that the Prophet meets the
   trial then present, which must have otherwise depressed the hearts of
   the godly. He saw that they were in a manner broken down; and then
   their dispersion was as it were a symbol of final ruin. If then the
   faithful had their minds continually fixed on that spectacle, they
   might have a hundred times despaired. The Prophet therefore comes here
   seasonably to their help, and reminds them, that though they were now
   halting, there was yet in God new vigor; that though they were
   scattered, it was yet in God's power to gather those who had been
   driven afar off. The meaning briefly is, that though the Church
   differed nothing for a time from a dead man, or at least from one that
   is maimed, no despair ought to be entertained; for the Lord sometimes
   raises up his people, as though he raised the dead from the grave: and
   this fact ought to be carefully noticed, for as soon as the Church of
   God does not shine forth, we think that it is wholly extinct and
   destroyed. But the Church is so preserved in the world, that it
   sometimes rises again from death: in short, the preservation of the
   Church, almost every day, is accompanied with many miracles.

   But we ought to bear in mind, that the life of the Church is not
   without a resurrection, nay, it is not without many resurrections, if
   the expression be allowed. This we learn from the words of the Prophet,
   when he says, I will then gather the halting, and assemble the driven
   away;' and then he adds, and her whom I have with evils afflicted.' And
   this has been expressly said, that the faithful may know, that God can
   bring out of the grave those whom he has delivered to death. For if the
   Jews had been destroyed at the pleasure of their enemies, they could
   not have hoped for so certain a remedy from God: but when they
   acknowledged that nothing happened to them except through the just
   judgment of God, they could entertain hope of restoration. How so?
   Because it is what is peculiar to God to bring forth the dead, as I
   have already said, from the grave; as it is also his work to kill. We
   then see that what the Prophet promised, respecting the restoration of
   the Church, is confirmed by this verse: I am he, says God, who has
   afflicted; cannot I again restore you to life? For as your death is in
   my hand, so also is your salvation. If the Assyrians or the Chaldeans
   had gained the victory over you against my will, there would be some
   difficulty in my purpose of gathering you; but as nothing has happened
   but by my command, and as I have proved that your salvation and your
   destruction is in my power, there is no reason for you to think that it
   is difficult for me to gather you, who have through my judgment been
   dispersed.

   He then adds, I will make the halting a remnant By remnant he
   understands the surviving Church. Hence the metaphor, halting, is
   extended even to destruction; as though he said, "Though the Jews for a
   time may differ nothing from dead men, I will yet cause them to rise
   again, that they may become again a new people." It was difficult to
   believe this at the time of exile: no wonder, then, that the Prophet
   here promises that a posterity would be born from a people that were
   dead. For though Babylon was to them like the grave, yet God was able
   to do such a thing as to bring them forth as new men, as it really
   happened.

   He afterwards subjoins And the driven afar off, a strong nation When
   the Jews were scattered here and there, how was it possible that God
   should from this miserable devastation form for himself a new people,
   and also a strong people? But the Prophet has put the contrary clauses
   in opposition to one another, that the Jews, amazed at their own evils,
   and astonished, might not cast away every consolation. As then he had
   dispersed them, he would again gather them, and would not only do this,
   but also make them a strong nation.

   He then adds, Reign shall Jehovah over them on mount Zion, henceforth
   and for ever The Prophet no doubt promises here the new restoration of
   that kingdom which God himself had erected; for the salvation of the
   people was grounded on this -- that the posterity of David should
   reign, as we shall hereafter see. And it is a common and usual thing
   with the prophets to set forth the kingdom of David, whenever they
   speak of the salvation of the Church. It was necessary then that the
   kingdom of David should be again established, in order that the Church
   might flourish and be secure. But Micah does not here name the
   posterity of David, but mentions Jehovah himself, not to exclude the
   kingdom of David, but to show that God would become openly the founder
   of that kingdom, yea, that he himself possessed the whole power. For
   though God governed the ancient people by the hand of David, by the
   hand of Josiah and of Hezekiah, there was yet, as it were, a shade
   intervening, so that God reigned not then visibly. The Prophet then
   mentions here some difference between that shadowy kingdom and the
   latter new kingdom, which, at the coming of the Messiah, God would
   openly set up. Jehovah himself shall then reign over them; as though he
   said, "Hitherto indeed, when the posterity of David held the
   government, as God himself created both David and his sons, and as they
   were anointed by his authority and command, it could not have been
   thought but that the kingdom was his, though he governed his people by
   the ministry and agency of men: but now God himself will ascend the
   throne in a conspicuous manner, so that no one may doubt but that he is
   the king of his people." And this was really and actually fulfilled in
   the person of Christ. Though Christ was indeed the true seed of David,
   he was yet at the same time Jehovah, even God manifested in the flesh.
   We hence see, that the Prophet here in lofty terms extols the glory of
   Christ's kingdom; as though he had said that it would not be a shadowy
   kingdom as it was under the Law. Jehovah then shall reign over you.

   He then subjoins, on mount Zion. We know that the seat of the kingdom
   of Christ has not been continued on mount Zion; but this verse must be
   connected with the beginning of this chapter. The Prophet has
   previously said, From Zion shall go forth a law, and the word of
   Jehovah from Jerusalem. If then the interpretation of this place be
   asked, that is, how Jehovah showed himself the king of his people, and
   erected his throne on mount Zion, the answer is, that from thence the
   law went forth from that place, as from a fountain flowed the doctrine
   of salvation, to replenish the whole world. As then the Gospel, which
   God caused to be promulgated through the whole world, had its beginning
   on mount Zion, so the Prophet says that God would reign there. But we
   must at the same time observe, that through the defection and perfidy
   of the people it has happened that mount Zion is now only an
   insignificant corner of the earth, and not the most eminent in the
   world, as also the city Jerusalem, according to the prediction of
   Zechariah. Mount Zion then is now different from what it was formerly;
   for wherever the doctrine of the Gospel is preached, there is God
   really worshipped, there sacrifices are offered; in a word, there the
   spiritual temple exists. But yet the commencement of the Gospel must be
   taken to the account, if we would understand the real meaning of the
   Prophet, that is, that Christ, or God in the person of Christ, began to
   reign on mount Zion, when the doctrine of the Gospel from thence went
   forth to the extremities of the world. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [127] It means, doubtless, no more here; some refer it to halting
   between two opinions, between idols and God: but such an idea is
   foreign to the drift of this passage. It is the depressed, weak, or
   afflicted and miserable state of the Church that is here set forth. --
   Ed.

   [128] It is a Niphal participle from hl', and corresponds in meaning
   with hndchh, "the ejected," in the last verse; only it is a stronger
   term, as it means one cast to a distance, while the latter signifies
   one cast or driven away. The first, as rendered by Junius and
   Tremelius, is procul disjecta, and the other is depulsa -- Ed.

   Micah 4:8

   8. And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of
   Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom
   shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.

   8. Et tu turris gregis, arx filiae Sion, ad te veniet; perveniet
   principatus primus, regnum filiae Jerusalem.


   Micah still continues the same subject, -- that the miserable
   calamities of the people, or even their ruin, will not prevent God to
   restore again his Church. Thou tower of the flock, he says, the
   fortress of the daughter of Zion, doubt not but that God will again
   restore to thee thy ancient kingdom and dignity from which thou seemest
   now to have entirely fallen. But interpreters take the tower of the
   flock in various senses. Some think that the devastation of the city
   Jerusalem is pointed out, because it became like a cottage, as it is
   said in Isaiah; and phl, ophil, they render "obscure," for its root is
   to cover. But another explanation is simpler, -- that the holy city is
   called the tower of the flock, because God had chosen it for himself,
   to gather his people thence; for we know that they had there their holy
   assemblies. Thou, then, the tower of the flock, and then, the fortress
   of the daughter of Zion, to thee shall come the former kingdom [129]
   If, however, the former sense be more approved, I will not contend;
   that is, that Jerusalem is here called the tower of the flock on
   account of its devastation, as it was reduced as it were into a
   cottage. As to the main import of the passage, there is no ambiguity;
   for the Prophet here strengthens the minds of the godly: they were not
   to regard the length of time, nor to allow their thoughts, to be
   occupied with their present calamity, but to feel assured, that what
   God had promised was in his power, that he could, as it were, raise the
   dead, and thus restore the kingdom of David, which had been destroyed.

   Do then, he says, firmly hope. -- Why? because come to thee, come to
   thee shall the former kingdom [130] Here the breaking off of the
   sentence is to be noticed, when the Prophet speaks of the ancient
   kingdom and dignity. It is not indeed to be doubted, but that the
   people of God had become objects of mockery, and that hypocrites and
   heathens thought that what David had testified respecting the
   perpetuity of his kingdom was a mere delusion.

   Behold thy kingdom,' he said, shall continue as long as the sun and the
   moon,'
   (Psalm 72)

   but soon after the death of Solomon, a small portion only was reserved
   for his posterity, and at length the kingdom itself and its dignity
   disappeared. This is the reason that the Prophet now says, that the
   former kingdom would come. Come, he says, to thee, daughter of Zion,
   come shall the former kingdom There is indeed no doubt, but that by the
   former kingdom he understands its most flourishing condition, recorded
   in Scripture, under David and Solomon.

   The kingdom, he says, to the daughter of Jerusalem shall come He
   expressly mentions the daughter of Jerusalem, because the kingdom of
   Israel had obscured the glory of the true kingdom. Hence the Prophet
   testifies here that God was not unmindful of his promise, and that he
   would restore to Jerusalem the dignity which it had lost, and unite the
   whole people into one body, that they might be no more divided, but
   that one king would rule over the whole race of Abraham. But this was
   not fulfilled, we are certain, at the coming of Christ, in a manner
   visible to men: we must therefore bear in mind what Micah has
   previously taught, -- that this kingdom is spiritual; for he did not
   ascribe to Christ a golden scepter, but a doctrine, "Come, and let us
   ascend unto the mount of Jehovah, and he will teach us of his ways; and
   then he added," From Zion shall go forth a law, and the word of Jehovah
   from Jerusalem. This, then, ought ever to be remembered, -- that God
   has not rendered Jerusalem glorious in the sight of men, as it was
   formerly, nor has he enriched it with influence and wealth and earthly
   power; but he has yet restored the sovereign authority; for he has not
   only subjected to himself the ten tribes which had formerly revolted,
   but also the whole world. Let us go on --

   Micah 4:9-10

   9. Now why dost thou cry out aloud? is there no king in thee? is thy
   counsellor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail.

   9. Nunc quare vociferaris vociferatione? Rex nullus in te? Au
   conciliarius tuus periit? Quia te occupavit dolor quasi parturientem.

   10. Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a
   woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and thou
   shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go even to Babylon; there
   shalt thou be delivered; there the Lord shall redeem thee from the hand
   of thine enemies.

   10. Dole et ignemisce, filia Sion, quasi parturiens; quia [131] exibis
   e civitate, et habitabis in ergo; et venies Babylonem usque; illic
   liberaberis, illic dedimet te Jehova e manu hostium tuorum.


   The Prophet blends here things in their nature wholly contrary, -- that
   the Jews were for a time to be cut off, -- and that afterwards they
   were to recover their former state. Why, he says, dost thou cry out
   with crying? We must notice the Prophet's design. He did not intend to
   overturn what he had before stated; but as the minds of the godly might
   have fainted amidst so many changes, the Prophet here gives them
   support, that they might continue firm in their faith; and hence he
   says, Why dost thou cry aloud with loud crying? That is, "I see that
   grievous troubles will arise capable of shaking even the stoutest
   hearts: time will be changeable; it will often be, that the faithful
   will be disturbed and degraded; but though various tumults may arise,
   and tempests throw all things into confusion, yet God will redeem his
   people." We now then see what the Prophet means by saying, Why dost
   thou now cry? Why dost thou make an uproar? for the verb here properly
   means, not only to cry out, but also to sound the trumpet; as though he
   said, Why do the Jews so much torment themselves? There is he says, no
   doubt, a good reason.

   And he adds, Is there no king among thee? This was doubtless the reason
   why the Jews so much harassed themselves; it was, because God had
   deprived them of their kingdom and of counsel: and we know what
   Jeremiah has said, Christ,' that is, the anointed of the Lord, by whose
   life we breathe, is slain,' (Lamentations 4:20.) Since, then, the whole
   Church derived as it were its life from the safety of its king, the
   faithful could not be otherwise than filled with amazement when the
   kingdom was upset and abolished; for the hope of salvation was taken
   away Is there, then, not a king among thee? and have thy counselors
   perished? Some think that the unfaithfulness of the people is here
   indirectly reproved, because they thought themselves to be destitute of
   the help of God and of his Christ, as though he said, -- "Have ye
   forgotten what God has promised to you, that he would be your king for
   ever, and would send the Messiah to rule over you? nay, has he not
   promised that the kingdom of David would be perpetual? Whence then, is
   this fear and trembling, as though God no longer reigned in the midst
   of you, and the throne of David were hopelessly overturned?" These
   interpreters, in confirmation of this opinion, say, that Christ is here
   distinguished by the same title as in Isaiah 9:7; where he is called
   yvph, ivots, a counselor. But as in this verse, it is the Prophet's
   design to terrify, and to reprove rather than to alleviate the
   grievousness of evils by consolation; it is more probable, that their
   own destitution is set before the people; as though Micah said, "What
   cause have you for trembling? Is it because your king and all his
   counselors have been taken away?" But what immediately follows proves
   that this sorrow arose from a just cause; it was because they were
   stripped of all those things which had been till that time the
   evidences of God's favor.

   Why then has pain laid hold on thee as on one in travail? Be in pain,
   he says, and groan; [132] that is, I will not prevent thee to grieve
   and to mourn; as though he said, "Certainly even the strongest cannot
   look on calamities so dreadful, without suffering the heaviest sorrow;
   but though God may for a time subject his children to the greatest
   tortures, and expose them to the most grievous evils, he will yet
   restore them at length from their exile." Thou shalt depart, he says,
   from the city, and dwell in the field: thou shalt come even to Babylon;
   but there thou shalt be delivered; there shall Jehovah redeem thee from
   the hand of thy enemies The import of the whole is, that though God
   would have a care for his people, as he had promised, there was yet no
   cause for the faithful to flatter themselves, as though they were to be
   exempt from troubles; but the Prophet, on the contrary, exhorts them to
   prepare themselves to undergo calamities, as they were not only to be
   ejected from their country, and to wander in strange lands like
   vagrants, but were to be led away into Babylon as to their grave.

   But to strengthen the minds of the faithful to bear the cross, he gives
   them a hope of deliverance, and says, that God would there deliver
   them, and there redeem them from the hand of their enemies. He repeats
   the adverb, sm, shem, there, twice, and not without cause: for the
   faithful might have excluded every hope of deliverance, as though the
   gate of God's power had been closed. And this is the reason why the
   Prophet repeats twice, there, there; even from the grave he will
   deliver and redeem thee: "Extend then your hope, not only to a small
   measure of favor, as though God could deliver you only from a state of
   some small danger, but even to death itself. Though then ye lay, as it
   were, in your graves, yet doubt not but that God will stretch forth his
   hand to you, for he will be your deliverer. God then in whose power is
   victory, can overcome many and innumerable deaths."

   Grant, Almighty God, that since under the guidance of thy Son we have

   scattered and torn asunder, -- O grant, that we may continue in the
   unity of faith, and perseveringly fight against all the temptations of
   this world, and never deviate from the right course, whatever new
   troubles may daily arise: and though we are exposed to many deaths, let
   us not yet be seized with fear, such as may extinguish in our hearts
   every hope; but may we, on the contrary, learn to raise up our eyes and
   minds, and all our thoughts, to thy great power, by which thou
   quickenest the dead, and raises from nothing things which are not, so
   that though we may be daily exposed to ruin, our souls may ever aspire
   to eternal salvation, until thou at length really slowest thyself to be
   the fountain of life, when we shall enjoy that endless felicity, which
   has beon obtained for us by the blood of thy only-begotten Son our
   Lord. Amen.

   Micah 4:11-13

   11. Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her
   be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion.

   11. Et nunc congregatae sunt contra se gentes multae (vel, robustae,)
   dicentes Damnata erit; et aspiciet in Sion oculus noster.

   12. But they know not the thoughts of the Lord, neither understand they
   his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor.

   12. Ipsi vero non noverunt cognitationes Jehovae, et non intellexerunt
   consilium ejus; quia congregabis eos quasi manipulum in aeream.

   13. Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn
   iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces
   many people: and I will consecrate their gain unto the Lord, and their
   substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.

   13. Surge, et tritura filia Sion; quia cornu tuum ponam ferrum, et
   ungulas tuas ponam chalybem; et conteres populos robustos; et dicabis
   Jehovae opes ipsorum, et substantiam eorum Dominatori universae terrae.


   The Prophet's object here is to give some alleviation to the faithful
   lest they should succumb under their calamities; for, as we have
   stated, there were most grievous evils approaching, sufficient to
   overwhelm the minds of the godly. The Prophet then raises up here, with
   the moat suitable comfort, those who would have otherwise fainted under
   their calamities; and the sum of the whole is this, -- that the
   faithful were not to be confounded on finding the ungodly proudly
   triumphing, as they are wont to do, when they seem to have gained their
   wishes. Since, then, the wicked show a petulant spirit beyond all
   bounds, the Prophet exhorts the faithful to sustain themselves by God's
   promises, and not to care for such insolence. He then subjoins a
   promise, -- that God would assemble all the forces of their enemies, as
   when one gathers many ears of corn into a bundle, that he may thrash
   them on the floor. I will come now to the words of the Prophet.

   Assemble, he says, against thee do nations, or strong nations: for, by
   saying, gvym rvym, guim rebim, he intimates one of two things, either
   that they were strong, or that they were large in number: as to the
   subject there is no great difference. The Prophet had this in view, --
   that though the Church of God may be pressed by a great multitude of
   enemies, it yet ought not to be broken down in mind: for the ungodly,
   while they cruelly domineer, do not understand the design of God.
   Assemble, then, against thee do many nations He sets the thing before
   them, to heal them of terror: for when we are beyond the reach of harm,
   we, for the most part, too heedlessly despise all dangers; and then,
   when we come to a real struggle, we tremble, or even fall and become
   wholly weak. This is the reason why the Prophet sets before the Jews
   their prospects, and shows that the time was near when they were to
   endure a siege, as enemies would, on all sides, surround them. Assemble
   then do nations, and strong or many nations: he shows here that the
   Jews had no reason to despond, though their enemies would far exceed
   them in number, and in forces, and in courage, for it was enough for
   them to be under the protection of God.

   Who say, condemned now shall be Zion [133] The verb chnph, chenaph,
   means to act wickedly and perversely. It may then be literally
   rendered, profane (scelerata) shall be Zion; and on it shall our eye
   look:' but this word is often taken metaphorically for condemnation.
   The meaning then is, Zion is now condemned:' and the Prophet, no doubt,
   intended to intimate here, that the enemies would so triumph, as though
   Zion were not under the guardianship of God; as when any one, who has
   rendered himself hateful by his vices, is left and forsaken by his
   patrons. So, then, the Prophet here arms the faithful against the
   arrogance of their enemies, that they might not despair, when they
   found that they were condemned by the consent of all men, and that this
   was the opinion of all, -- that they were forsaken by God.

   Consolation follows, But they know not the thoughts of Jehovah, nor
   understand his counsel: for verbs in the past tense have the meaning of
   the present. Here the Prophet recalls the attention of the godly to a
   subject the most suitable to them: for when the wicked rise up so
   cruelly against us, we are apt to think that all things are allowed to
   them, and then their reproaches and slanders immediately take
   possession of our minds and thoughts, so that we in a manner measure
   God's judgment by their words. Hence when the ungodly deride our faith,
   and boast that we are forsaken by God, we succumb, being as it were
   filled with amazement: and nothing is easier than to shake off from us
   faith and the memory of God's promises, whenever the ungodly are thus
   insolent. The Prophet then does not without cause apply a remedy which
   ought to be carefully observed by us. Who say, condemned is Zion; but
   they are like the blind when judging of colors, for they understand not
   the counsel of Jehovah and his thoughts they know not. We now then see
   what the Prophet had in view, which was to show, -- that the faithful
   would be unwise and foolish, if they formed an opinion of God's
   judgment according to the boasting of the ungodly: for Satan carries
   them away in a furious manner; and when the Lord gives them liberty to
   do evil, they think that they shall be conquerors to the end. As then
   the ungodly are thus inebriated with foolish confidence, and despise
   not only men, but God himself, the Prophet here holds up and supports
   the minds of the godly that they might ascend higher, and thus
   understand that the design of God was not the same as what the wicked
   thought, who neither belonged to nor approached God. [134]

   It is especially needful to know this truth. Some at the first sight
   may think it frigid, "O! than, what does the Prophet mean? he says that
   what these declare is not the design of Jehovah; and this we know." But
   were all to examine the subject, they would then confess with one
   mouth, that nothing could have been more seasonable than this
   consolation. Now we are wounded by reproaches, and this very often
   happens to ingenuous men; and then, while the ungodly vomit forth their
   slanders, we think that God rests indifferently in heaven; and one of
   their words, like a cloud, obscures the judgment of God. As soon as any
   one of the wicked derides us, and laughs at our simplicity, threatens
   ferociously, and spreads forth his terrors, his words, as I have said,
   are like a cloud intervening between us and God. This is the reason why
   the Prophet says here, that the thoughts of Jehovah are different, and
   that his counsel is different: in short, the Prophet's object is to
   show, that whenever the ungodly thus proudly despise us, and also
   reproachfully threaten and terrify us, we ought to raise our thoughts
   to heaven. -- Why so? Because the design of God is another. Their
   boastings then will vanish, for they arise from nothing, and they shall
   come to nothing, but the purpose of God shall stand.

   But let us now see why the Prophet spoke here of the design and
   thoughts of God: for if only these two words are brought before us,
   there is certainly but little solid comfort, and nothing that has much
   force or power. There is then another principle to be understood, --
   that the thoughts of God are known to us, who are taught in his school.
   The counsel of God then is not hidden, for it is revealed to us in his
   Word. Consolation therefore depends on a higher and a more recondite
   doctrine; that is, that the faithful, in their miseries, ought to
   contemplate the counsel of God as in a mirror. And what is this? that
   when he afflicts us, he holds a remedy in his hand, and that when he
   throws us into the grave, he can restore us to life and safety. When,
   therefore, we understand this design of God, -- that he chastens his
   Church with temporal evils, and that the issue will ever be most
   salutary, -- when this is known by us, there is then no reason why the
   slanders of the ungodly should deject our minds; and when they vomit
   forth all their reproaches, we ought to adhere firmly to this counsel
   of God. But that the ungodly are thus proud is no matter of wonder; for
   if they raise their horns against God, why should they not despise us
   also, who are so few in number, and of hardly any influence, at least
   not equal to what they possess? The Church is indeed contemptible in
   the eyes of the world; and it is no wonder if our enemies thus deride
   us, and load us with ridicule and contempt, when they dare to act so
   frowardly towards God. But it is enough for us to know, that they do
   not understand the counsel of God. We now then see the Prophet's
   meaning, and an explanation follows, --

   For thou shalt assemble them, he says, as a sheaf [135] to the floor
   The Prophet adds this clause as an explanation, that we may know what
   the counsel of God is, which he has mentioned, and that is, that God
   will collect the enemies as a sheaf. What is a sheaf? It is a small
   quantity of corn, it may be three hundred or a thousand ears of corn:
   they are ears of corn, and carried in a man's hand. And then, what is
   to be done with the sheaf? It is to be thrashed on the floor. It was
   indeed difficult to believe, that enemies, when thus collected together
   on every side, would be like a sheaf. If an army assembled against us,
   not only ten or twenty thousand, but a much larger number, who would
   think, according to the judgment of the flesh, that they would be like
   a sheaf? They shall be as so many deaths and graves: even the thought
   of God ought to be to us of more account than the formidable power of
   men. Whenever, therefore, our enemies exceed us in strength and number,
   let us learn to arise to that secret counsel of God, of which our
   Prophet now speaks; and then it will be easy for us to regard a vast
   multitude to be no more than a handful. And he says, that our enemies
   are to be gathered to a floor, that they may be thrashed there. They
   assemble themselves for another purpose; for they think that we shall
   be presently in their power, that they may swallow us up; but when they
   thus collect themselves and their forces, the Lord will frustrate their
   purpose and cause them to be thrashed by us. It follows, --

   Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion; for I have made thy horn [136]
   iron, and thy hoofs brass. The Prophet here confirms what he had
   previously said: and he exhorts the daughter of Zion to arise; for it
   was necessary for her to have been cast down, so as to lie prostrate on
   the ground. God did not indeed restore at once his Church, but
   afflicted her for a time, so that she differed nothing from a dead man.
   As then a dead body lies on the ground without any feeling, so also did
   the Church of God lie prostrate. This is the reason why the Prophet now
   says, Arise, daughter of Zion; as though God, by his voice, roused the
   dead. We hence see, that the word qvmy, kumi, is emphatical; for the
   Prophet reminds us, that there is no reason for the faithful wholly to
   despair, when they find themselves thus cast down, for their
   restoration is in the hand and power of God, as it is the peculiar
   office of God to raise the dead. And this same truth ought to be
   applied for our us, whenever we are so cast down, that no strength, no
   vigor, remains in us. How then can we rise again? By the power of God,
   who by his voice alone can restore us to life, which seemed to be
   wholly extinct.

   He afterwards subjoins, Thresh, for I have made thy horn iron, and thy
   hoofs brass. A mode of thrashing, we know, was in use among the Jews
   the same with that in Italy and at this day in French Provence. We here
   thrash the corn with flails; but there by treading. The Prophet speaks
   here of this custom, and compares the Church of God to oxen; as though
   he said "The Jews shall be like oxen with iron horns and brazen hoofs
   that they may lay prostrate under them the whole strength of the
   nations. However much then the nations may now excel, I will subject
   them under the feet of my people, as if sheaves were thrashed by them."

   He then adds, [137] And thou shalt separate or consecrate their wealth
   to Jehovah, and their substance [138] to the Lord of the whole earth
   Here the Prophet specifies the end for which God had purposed to
   subject the heathen nations to his chosen people, -- that he might be
   glorified. This is the meaning. But they have refined too much in
   allegories, who have thought that this prophecy ought to be confined to
   the time of Christ: for the Prophet no doubt meant to extend
   consolation to the whole kingdom of Christ, from the beginning to the
   end. Others, not more correctly, say, that this is to be referred to
   the Babylonian captivity because then Daniel and some others thrashed
   the people, when heathen kings were induced through their teaching to
   restore the temple, and also to offer some worship to the God of
   Israel. But on this point they are both mistaken, because they take the
   word thrashing in a different sense from the Prophet; for it commonly
   means that heathen nations are to be subjected to the Church of God:
   and this takes place, whenever God stretches forth his hand to the
   faithful, and suffers not the ungodly to exercise their cruelty as they
   wish; yea, when he makes them humbly to supplicate the faithful. This
   often happens in the world, as it is written of Christ, thy enemies
   shall lick the earth,' (Psalm 72:9.) But this prophecy shall not be
   fulfilled until the last coming of Christ. We indeed begin to tread on
   our enemies whenever God by his power destroys them, or at least causes
   them to tremble and to be cast down, as we find that they dread
   whenever any change takes place; and then they blandly profess that
   they desire to serve God. So at this day it has happened both in France
   and in Italy. How many hypocrites, for the sake of an earthly
   advantage, have submitted themselves to God? and how many such England
   produced when the Gospel flourished there? All the courtiers, and
   others who were unwilling to incur the displeasure of the king,
   professed themselves to be the very best lovers of religion. (optimos
   pietatis cultores, -- the best observers of piety) But yet this is ever
   the case,

   Aliens have been false to thee,' (Psalm 18:44.)

   We hence see what the prophet means when he speaks of thrashing: he
   intimates, that the Lord would often cause that the enemies of the
   Church should be bruised, though no one crushed them: but, as I have
   said, we must look forward to the last day, if we wish to see the
   complete fulfillment of this prophecy.

   He afterwards adds, Thou shalt consecrate their wealth to Jehovah, and
   their substance to the Lord of the whole earth The Prophet shows here,
   that the dominion is not to be hoped for by the children of God, that
   they may abound in worldly pleasures, and appropriate every thing to
   themselves and also abuse their power, as ungodly men are wont to do;
   but that all is to be applied to the worship and the glory of God. For
   what purpose, then does God design his Church to become eminent? That
   he himself may alone shine forth, and that the faithful may rightly
   enjoy their honor, and not become thereby proud. There is, therefore
   nothing more alien to the power of the Church than pride, or cruelty,
   or avarice. This, then that is said ought to be carefully observed,
   their wealth thou shalt consecrate to Jehovah He had spoken before of
   power, "Thou shalt bind strong people, thou shalt thrash them, and thou
   shalt tread them under thy feet;" but lest the faithful should turn all
   this to a purpose the Lord had not designed, a most suitable correction
   is immediately added, and that is, that this power shall not be
   exercised according to the will of men, but according to the will of
   God: Thou shalt then consecrate, etc.; and he uses the word chrm,
   cherem, which means to make a thing an anathema or an offering; [139]
   as though he said "God will raise his Church that it may rule over its
   enemies; but let the faithful at the same time take heed, that they
   rule not tyrannically; for God designs ever to reign alone: therefore
   the whole excellency, the whole dignity, the whole power of the Church
   ought to be applied for this end, -- that all things may become subject
   to God, and every thing among the nations may be altogether sacred to
   him so that the worship of God may flourish among the conquerors, as
   well as among the conquered." We now perceive the Prophet's object in
   speaking of consecrating the wealth of the nations. Now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [133] Jam damnata erit. Newcome renders the distich thus, -- Who say,
   Let her be defiled,
   And let our eye see its desire on Zion. Profaned, or defiled, it is no
   doubt the meaning of the verb. But it is better to retain the future
   tense here, though it may often, in the third person, be rendered as an
   imperative. To look on, is a Hebrew idiom, and means often to triumph
   or exalt over another, or to gain the upper hand. See Psalm 22:17;
   Psalm 118:7. Several copies have the word for "eyes" in the singular
   number, as the verb is so: but anomalies of this kind often occur, as
   it is the case in Greek with respect to plural nouns in the neuter
   gender, and in Welsh, and when the verb precedes its nominative, almost
   in all instances. I offer the following version, -- Who say, "Defiled
   shall she be,
   And look on Zion shall our eyes." -- Ed.

   [134] The beginning of these two lines is very emphatic: I would give
   this rendering, -- But they -- they know not the purposes of Jehovah,
   And they understand not his counsel. It has been rendered, "But, as for
   them;" but this is flat, and too prosaic. -- Ed.

   [135] Manipulum, a handful, a bundle of fruit; myr, a sheaf,--a
   poetical singular for the plural -- sheaves. -- Ed.

   [136] Horn, in Scripture, means often elevation, dignity, power,
   strength. It means evidently in the last here. Zion was made strong to
   thrash the nations, and supplied with strong hoofs to tread on them.
   The Paraphrase of Rabbi Jonathan is to the purpose, Fortes sicut
   ferrum, et robusti sicut aes -- "Strong as iron, and robust as brass."
   And that this is the meaning is proved by what follows, Thou shalt beat
   in pieces, or beat small, or thrash out, strong nations. -- Ed.

   [137] It is not often that Calvin passes over a sentence without
   noticing it, but he does so here; and it is this, and thou shalt tear
   in pieces strong nations. The verb is hdqvt, thou shalt beat small, or
   thrash out; see Isaiah 28:28; perhaps the latter sense is most suitable
   to the passage. The meaning is, that a complete subjugation will take
   place. To thrash and to thrash out, is to conquer and to bring
   thoroughly under subjection. -- Ed.

   [138] The Hebrew word for this is chyl, and for "wealth" vts. The
   latter means gain, spoil, or what is often unjustly got, or what is
   scraped together and constitutes the wealth of the covetous; chyl is
   properly substance, including possessions of all kinds, land, cattle,
   etc. vts serves to include money, silver and gold; and chyl, everything
   else which makes up wealth. The verb, "consecrate," is in Hebrew in the
   first person, as it is in our version. There is no different reading;
   but the Septuagint and the earlier versions put it in the second
   person, to correspond with the previous verb, "Thou shalt beat in
   pieces." There will be no difference in the sense, if we render it
   according to the Hiphil form, in which it is found, -- "I will cause
   thee to consecrate." Jerome, Theodoret, Marckius, Dathius, Newcome, and
   Henderson, adopt the second person. -- This construction renders the
   passage no doubt more uniform. -- Ed.

   [139] The word is very emphatic; it means to devote a thing to a
   purpose forever, so as to be unchangeably settled. chrm, says
   Parkhurst, "is anything separated absolutely from its common condition
   and devoted to Jehovah, so as to be incapable of redemption. See
   Leviticus 27:21, 28, 29. As a verb in Hiph. To separate or devote thus
   to Jehovah. Leviticus 27:28, 29; Micah 4:12." It is therefore a
   sacrilege to take merely to our own use what ought to be, or what we
   have, thus consecrated to the Lord. -- Ed.

   Micah 5:1-2

   1. Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid
   siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon
   the cheek.

   1. [140] Nunc colligas te (vel, obsidione cingeris, ut alii vertunt)
   filia congregationis (hoc est, turmae;) obsidionem posuit contra nos;
   in virga percutient ad maxillam judicem Israel.

   2. But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the
   thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is
   to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from
   everlasting.

   2. Et tu Beth-lehem Ephrata, parva ad essendum (ut ita loquar) inter
   millia Jehudah; ex te mihi egredietur ad essendum dominatorem (sic
   transfero durius, ut sit dominator) in Israel: et egressus ejus ab
   initio, a diebus seculi.


   To encourage the faithful to patience, the Prophet again reminds them
   that hard and severe time was nigh; for it was needful to put them in
   mind often of the approaching calamity, lest terror should wholly
   discourage them. As then there was danger from despair, the Prophet
   often repeats what he has already said of God's judgment, which was
   then suspending over the people of Israel. And this mode and order of
   teaching ought to be observed. When the Prophets threaten us, or
   denounce the punishment we have deserved, we either become torpid, or
   grow angry with God, and murmur: but when they set forth any thing of
   comfort, we then indulge ourselves and become too secure. It is
   therefore necessary to connect threatening with promises, so that we
   may be always ready to endure temporal evils, and that our minds,
   sustained by hope, may, at the same time, depend on the Lord, and
   recomb on him. It was for this reason that the Prophet again mentions
   what he had already several times stated, -- that the Jews would be
   surrounded by a siege. How do these two things agree, -- that the
   enemies, assembled together, would be like sheaves which are taken to
   the floor to be trodden by the feet of animals, -- and that the Jews
   would be besieged? I answer, that these things harmonize, because the
   temporary punishment, which God would inflict on his Church, would not
   prevent him to restore it again whenever it pleased him. Lest,
   therefore, security should creep over the minds of the godly, the
   Prophet designed often to remind them of that dreadful calamity which
   might have entirely upset them, had no support been afforded them, that
   is, had not God sustained them by his word.

   Now then thou shalt assemble thyself, he says, O daughter of a troop
   The verb htgddy, etgaddi, and the noun gdvd, gadud, sound alike; as
   though he said, Thou shalt he collected, O daughter of collection. The
   Prophet addresses Jerusalem: but we must see why he calls her the
   daughter of collection. Some think that by this word is designated the
   splendid and wealthy state of Jerusalem; as though the Prophet said, --
   "This city has been hitherto populous, but now it shall be reduced to
   such straits that none shall dare to go forth beyond its gates, for
   they shall on every side be surrounded." But the Prophet calls
   Jerusalem the daughter of a troop in another sense, -- because they
   were wont to occasion great troubles: as thieves agree together, and
   meet in troops for the purpose of committing plunder; so also the
   Prophet calls Jerusalem the daughter of a troop, for its citizens were
   wont willfully to do great evils, and like robbers to use violence.
   Thou then, he says, shalt now be collected; that is, thou shalt not
   send forth thy troops, but enemies shall assemble thee together by a
   severe siege, so that thou shalt contract thyself like a bundle.

   There are, then, two clauses in this verse, -- that though the Lord
   resolved to help his Church, he would yet straiten her for a time, --
   and then the Prophet shows the reason, lest they complained that they
   were too severely treated: "You have been hitherto," he says, "without
   a cause oppressive to others: the time then is come when the Lord will
   return to you your recompense." As Isaiah says

   Woe to thee, plunderer!
   Shalt thou not also be exposed to plunder?'
   Isaiah 33:1;

   so also in this place, -- "Ye have assembled in troops, that ye might
   pillage innocent men; therefore other troops shall now encircle you;
   nay, ye shall be beset by your own fear." The verb is in Hithpael: he
   says not, "Thou daughter of a troop shalt be now encircled;" but he
   says "Thou shalt gather thyself."

   He then adds, A siege has he set against thee. This may refer to God;
   but it must be understood only of enemies: for the Prophet immediately
   adds, They shall strive with the rod, etc. in the pleural number, --
   They shall then strike with the rod the cheek of the judge of Israel.
   He means that the Jews would be subdued by their enemies that their
   judges and governors would be exposed to every kind of contumely and
   dishonor, for to strike on the cheek is to offer the greatest
   indignity; as indeed it is the greatest contempt, as Demosthenes says,
   and is so mentioned by the lawyers. We now then perceive, that the
   Prophet's object was to show, -- that the Jews in vain boasted of their
   kingdom and civil constitution, for the Lord would expose the governors
   of that kingdom to extreme contempt. The enemies then shall strike
   their judges even on the cheek. [141]

   But there follows immediately a consolation: we hence see that the
   Prophet, at one time, humbles the children of God: and prepares them
   for enduring the cross; and then he mitigates all sorrow; yea, and
   makes them to rejoice in the midst of their evils. For this purpose he
   adds what follows --

   Thou Bethlehem Ephratah, art small, that thou shouldest be among the
   thousands of Judah As Matthew quotes this passage differently, some
   think that it ought to be read as a question, And thou, Bethlehem
   Ephratah, art thou the least among the provinces of Judah? Matthew says
   "Thou art by no means the least, thou excellest. [142] " But what need
   there is of distorting the words of the Prophet, as it was not the
   design of the Evangelist to relate the expressions of the Prophet, but
   only to point out the passage. As to the words, Matthew had regards to
   the condition of the town Bethlehem, such as it was at the coming of
   Christ. It then indeed began to be eminent: but the Prophet represents
   here how ignoble and mean a place Bethlehem then was, Thou, he says,
   art the least among the thousands of Judah. Some, not very wisely, give
   this explanation, "Thou art the least among the thousands of Judah";
   that is, "Though there might be a thousand towns in the tribe of Judah,
   yet thou couldest hardly have a place among so great a number." But
   this has been said through ignorance of a prevailing custom: for the
   Jews, we know, were wont to divide their districts into thousands or
   chiliads. As in the army there are centurions, so also in the divisions
   of every nation there are hundreds; there are also in an army tribunes,
   who preside over a thousand men. Thus the Prophet calls them thousands,
   that is, tribunes; for the districts are so arranged, that the town,
   which, with its villages, could bring forth three thousand men, had
   three prefectures; and it had three tribunes, or four or five, if it
   was larger. The Prophet then, in order to show that this town was small
   and hardly of any account, says, Thou, Bethlehem, art hardly sufficient
   to be one province. And it was a proof of its smallness that hardly a
   thousand men could be made up from Bethlehem and its neighboring
   villages. There were not, we know, many towns in the tribe of Judah;
   and yet a large army could be there collected. Since then the town of
   Bethlehem was so small, that it could hardly attain the rank of a
   province, it is hence no doubt evident that it was but a mean town. We
   now perceive what the Prophet had in view.

   Thou, Bethlehem, he says, art small among the cities of Judah; yet
   arise, or go forth, for me shall one from thee, who is to be a Ruler in
   Israel. He calls it Bethlehem Ephratah; for they say that there was
   another Bethlehem in the tribe of Zebulon, and we know that Ephratah in
   meaning is nearly the same with Bethlehem; for both designate an
   abundance of fruit or provisions: and there David was born.

   I will now proceed to the second clause, From thee shall go forth for
   me one who is to be a Ruler Here the Prophet introduces God as the
   speaker, go forth, he says, shall one for me. God declares in this
   passage that it was not his purpose so to destroy his people, but that
   he intended, after a season, to restore them again. He therefore
   recalls the attention of the faithful to himself and to his eternal
   counsel; as though he said, -- "I have thus for a time cast you away,
   that I may yet manifest my care for you." For me then shall go forth
   one who is to be a Ruler in Israel. Now there is no doubt but that the
   Prophet at the sable time recalls the attention of the faithful to the
   promise which had been given to David. For whence arises the hope of
   salvation to the chosen people, except from the perpetuity of that
   kingdom? The Prophet now says, -- "There is indeed a reason, according
   to the perception of the flesh, why the faithful should despond; for
   whence does their confidence arise, except from the kingdom of David?
   and from what place is David to arise? Even from Bethlehem; for
   Bethlehem has been called the city of David; and yet it is an obscure
   and a small town, and can hardly be considered a common province. Since
   it is so, the minds of the faithful may be depressed; but this
   smallness shall be no hindrance to the Lord, that he should not bring
   forth from thence a new king."

   Even before the time of David Bethlehem was a small town, and one of
   the most common provinces. Who could have expected that a king would
   have been chosen from such a hamlet, and then, that he should come from
   a hut? for David belonged to a pastoral family; his father was a
   shepherd, and he was the least among his brethren. Who then could have
   thought that light would have arisen from such a corner, yea, from so
   mean a cottage? This was done contrary to the expectations of men.
   Hence the Prophet sets here before the faithful a similar expectation
   for their comfort; as though he said, -- "Has not God once formed a
   most perfect state of things by making David a king, so that the people
   became in every respect happy and blessed? And whence did David come?
   It was from Bethlehem. There is then no reason why your present
   miseries should over-much distress you; for God can again from the same
   place bring forth a king to you, and he will do so."

   Thou then Bethlehem, small art thou, etc. The prophet doubtless
   intended here that the faithful should consider of what kind was the
   beginning of that most perfect state, when David was chosen king. David
   was a shepherd, a man in humble life, without reputation, without
   influence, and even the humblest among his brethren. Since then God had
   drawn light out of darkness there was no cause for the faithful to
   despair of a future restoration, considering what had been the
   beginning of the previous happy condition of the people. We now
   understand the Prophet's meaning. But the rest I cannot finish today; I
   must therefore defer it till tomorrow.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [140] Calvin has, in this division, followed the Septuagint, and so
   have the translators of our version. This verse, in Hebrew, belongs to
   the last chapter. Marckius, Dathius, and Henderson, follow the Hebrew
   division; Junius, and Tremelius, and Newcome, that of our version.

   [141] This verse has been variously interpreted. It is considered by
   most as connected with the last chapter. Some, as Marckius, consider it
   as an address to the Roman power; some, to the Babylonian; and others,
   to Jerusalem. The construction of it is the main point. The first verb,
   ttgddy, is found in six other places, and rendered in all, except in
   Jeremiah 5:7, to cut one's self; but its other meaning, as in Jeremiah
   5:7, and evidently here is to troop or band together; and the noun
   gdvd, which follows, commonly means a band or a troop. The participle
   sm, in the next clause, can refer to nothing in the text but to "the
   daughter of a troop." The obvious and natural rendering of the verse
   would be the following, -- Band thyself together, thou daughter of a
   band,
   Laying against us a siege: --
   With the rod shall they strike on the cheek
   The judge of Israel. The daughter of a band or a troop means a military
   power, which collects bands or troops for warlike purposes. It is
   certainly more obvious to apply this to the Babylonian power than to
   Jerusalem, especially as the next line, "Laying against us a siege,"
   necessarily refers to the latter. "The judge" is, as Calvin seems to
   take it, a poetical singular for the plural. No particular person is
   meant, as Newcome and others seem to think, but judges in general. --
   Ed.

   [142] This does not follow; for to say that it was "not the least," is
   not to deny that it was "small." There is, in fact, no contradiction in
   the expressions. Matthew quotes literally neither the Hebrew nor the
   Septuagint version. The latter, in this case, agrees with the former.
   He gives the sense, but not the words, even in two instances besides
   this. Instead of "Ephratah," he has, "in the land of Judah;" and
   instead of "Ruler," he has, "Governor that shall rule," or feed. The
   meaning in these three instances is the same, though the words are
   different. The place was, in former times, called Bethlehem-Judah, and
   also Ephratah. See Genesis 35:19; Judges 17:7; and Ruth 4:11. The
   attempt by a question to produce similarity of expressions in the
   second line, according to what is done by Marckius and Newcome, is by
   no means to be approved. The literal rendering is the following: -- And
   thou, Bethlehem Ephratah!
   Small to be among the thousands of Judah, --
   From thee shall one to me come forth,
   To be a Ruler in Israel:
   And his going forth has been
   From of old, from the days of ages. The word for "going forth" is
   plural, which, as Calvin says, is sometimes used for the singular; but
   two MSS. Have it in the singular number, mts'tv. The last line in the
   Septuagint is as follows, -- ap arches, ex emeron aionos "In every age,
   from the foundation of the world, there has been some manifestation of
   the Messiah. He was the hope, as he was the salvation, of the world,
   from the promise to Adam in paradise, to his manifestation in the flesh
   four thousand years after." -- Adam Clarke. -- Ed.

   Prayer.

   Greet, Almighty God, that as we cease not to provoke thy wrath against
   us, and as it is needful for us to be often chastised by thy hand, that
   we may be humbled and learn to submit ourselves to thee in true and
   willing obedience, -- O grant, that we faint not under thy scourges,
   but ever raise up our minds to the hope of deliverance, which thou
   givest to us through our Mediator; whom thou hast once for all sent
   into the world, that thou mightest through him reconcile us to thyself,
   and through whom also thou bringest help whenever we need it and may we
   at the same time learn to rely on thy only-begotten Son, so that with
   courageous minds we may pass through all the miseries of this world,
   and never at any time grow weary, until having at length obtained the
   victory, we come to that blessed rest and enjoy the fruit of our
   victory, through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.

   Lecture Ninety-first

   We began yesterday to explain the promise by which our Prophet designed
   to sustain the minds of the faithful, lest they should despair in their
   heavy trial. He reminds them, as it has been stated, of the
   commencement of the kingdom: as David had been raised as it were from
   nothing, and God has given in him an example of his wonderful grace,
   the Prophet reminds the godly, that the same is now to be expected,
   that God will again raise up the fallen kingdom. "Go forth then from
   Bethlehem, he says, shall one who is to be a Ruler in Israel, though it
   was but a mean town. He calls him a Ruler in Israel; for he had before
   declared that there would be such a dreadful judgment, that the enemy
   would strike with the hand the face of the judge; and this was the same
   as though the Prophet had said, that no honor would be shown to the
   people, for the chief himself would be beaten. He therefore now
   promises a new Ruler, he promises that there would be again some civil
   order to be found among the people; for a governor could not have been
   struck on the check, except all authority and honor had departed. We
   then see what the Prophet intended by mentioning the word, Ruler; it
   was to show, that God would again cause that a new Prince would arise
   to govern the people. It was therefore a remedy to their devastation.

   But the Prophet subjoins, His going forth is from the beginning, or
   from far antiquity and from the days of ages, that is from the days of
   eternity. He intimates here that it would not be a sudden thing, that a
   prince should arise to govern the people; for it had been already long
   ago determined by God. This is the plain meaning. Some, I know,
   pertinaciously maintain, that the Prophet speaks here of the eternal
   existence of Christ; and as for myself I willingly own that the
   divinity of Christ is here proved to us; but as this will never be
   allowed by the Jews, I prefer taking the words simply as they are, --
   that Christ will not come forth unexpectedly from Bethlehem, as though
   God had previously determined nothing respecting him. His goings forth,
   then, are from the beginning. But others bring a new refinement, --
   that the Prophet uses the plural number, his goings forth, to designate
   the twofold nature of Christ: but there is in this an absurdity; for
   the Prophet could not properly nor wisely mention the human nature of
   Christ with the divine, with reference to eternity. The Word of God, we
   know, was eternal; and we know, that when the fullness of time came, as
   Paul says, Christ put on our nature, (Galatians 4:4.) Hence the
   beginning of Christ as to the flesh was not so old, if his existence be
   spoken of: to set them together then would have been absurd. It is a
   common thing in Hebrew to use the plural for the singular number. He
   says then, that the going forth of Christ is from eternity; for he will
   not go forth suddenly from Bethlehem, as one who rises unexpectedly to
   bring help, when things are in a hopeless state, and so rises, when
   nothing had been foreseen. But the Prophet declares that the going
   forth of Christ would be different, -- that God had from the beginning
   determined to give his people an eternal king.

   At the same time, we must repudiate that gloss with which the Rabbis
   are pleased; for they say that the Messiah was created before the
   creation of the world, and also the throne of eternity, and the Law,
   and other things; but these are insipid fables. The Prophet shows
   simply, that even before the world was made Christ was chief, no he is
   also called the Firstborn of every creature, for by him all things were
   created, (Colossians 1:15) and the same Word of God, by whom the world
   was created, is to be the Head of the Church and by him what has been
   lost is to be recovered. We now then comprehend what the Prophet meant
   by saying, the goings forth of Christ are from eternity But I would not
   concede to the Jews, that only by the perpetual appointment of God the
   going forth of Christ has been from the beginning, or from all ages:
   but two things must be noticed by us, -- that Christ, who was
   manifested in the flesh that he might redeem the Church of God, was the
   eternal Word, by whom the world was created, -- and then, that he was
   destined by the eternal counsel of God to be the first-born of every
   creature, and especially to be the Head of the Church, that he might
   restore a fallen world by his grace and power.

   We now then see the reason why the Prophet connects together these two
   things, -- that there would go forth one from Bethlehem who would rule
   among Israel, -- and yet that his goings forth have been from eternity:
   for if he had only said what I explained yesterday, an objection might
   easily have been made, and this might have come into the mind of some,
   -- "Why dost thou say that one will come from Bethlehem who will govern
   the chosen people, as though God were to contrive a new remedy on
   seeing that it is all over with respect to the deliverance of his
   Church?" The Prophet here anticipates this objection, and reminds us,
   that his goings forth have been from eternity, that they have been
   already decreed, even from the beginning; for with God there is nothing
   new, so that he should stand in need of holding any unlooked for
   consultation; as is the case with us when any thing happens which we in
   no degree apprehended; we then find it necessary to devise some new
   measures. The Prophet shows that nothing of this kind can happen to
   God: but all this, -- that people are reduced to nothing, -- and that
   they are again restored by Christ, -- all this is overruled by his
   secret and incomprehensible providence. His goings forth then are from
   the beginning, and from the days of eternity. Let us proceed --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Micah 5:3

   3. Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she which
   travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren shall
   return unto the children of Israel.

   3. Propterea [143] dabit eos (hoc est, ponet eos, vel, relinquet) usque
   ad tempus quo parturiens pariet; et revertentur ad filios Israel
   residuum fratrum ejus.


   The Prophet here again so moderates his words, that the Jews might
   understand, that they were to endure many evils before God relieved
   their miseries. He wished then here to prepare the minds of the godly
   to bear evils, that they might not despair in great troubles, nor be
   depressed by extreme fear. He then states these two things, -- that the
   people, as they deserved, would be heavily afflicted, -- and then that
   God, notwithstanding such severe punishment, would be mindful of his
   covenant, so as to gather at length some remnants and not to suffer his
   people to be wholly destroyed. He therefore promises a middle course
   between a prosperous state and destruction. The people, says the
   Prophet, shall not continue entire. -- How so? For God will cut off the
   kingdom and the city; and yet he will afford relief to the miserable:
   When they shall think that they are given up to entire ruin, he will
   stretch forth his hand to them. This is the sum of the whole.

   He then says that they shall be delivered up, that is, forsaken by God,
   until she who is in travail bringeth forth [144] There are those who
   apply this to the blessed virgin; as though Micah had said that the
   Jews were to look forward to the time when the Virgin would bring forth
   Christ: but all may easily see that this is a forced interpretation.
   The Prophet, I have no doubt, in using this similitude, compares the
   body of the people to a woman with child. The similitude of a woman in
   travail is variously applied. The wicked, when they promise to
   themselves impunity, are suddenly and violently laid hold on: thus
   their destruction is like the travail of a woman with child. But the
   meaning of this passage is different; for the Prophet says that the
   Jews would be like pregnant women, for this reason, -- that though they
   would have to endure the greatest sorrows, there yet would follow a
   joyful and happy issue. And Christ himself employs this example for the
   same purpose,

   A woman,' he says, has sorrow when she brings forth, but immediately
   rejoices when she sees a man born into the world,' (John 16:21.)

   So Micah says in this place, that the chosen people would have a happy
   deliverance from their miseries, for they would bring forth. There
   shall indeed be the most grievous sorrows, but their issue will be joy,
   that is, when they shall know that they and their salvation had been
   the objects of God's care, when they shall understand that their
   chastisements had been useful to them. Until then she who is in travail
   bringeth forth, God, he says, will forsake them

   There are then two clauses in this verse; -- the first is, that the
   Jews were for a time to be forsaken, as though they were no longer
   under the power and protection of God; -- the other is that God would
   be always their guardian, for a bringing forth would follow their
   sorrows. The following passage in Isaiah is of an opposite character;

   We have been in sorrow, we have been in travail,
   and we brought forth wind,' (Isaiah 26:18.)

   The faithful complain there that they had been oppressed with the
   severest troubles, and had come to the birth, but that they brought
   forth nothing but wind, that is, that they had been deceived by vain
   expectation, for the issue did not prove to be what they had hoped. But
   the Lord promises here by Micah something better, and that is, that the
   end of all their evils would be the happy restoration of the people, as
   when a woman receives a compensation for all her sorrows when she sees
   that a child is born.

   And he confirms this sentence by another, when he says, To the children
   of Israel shall return, or be converted, the residue of his brethren
   [145] The Prophet then intimates that it could not be otherwise but
   that God would not only scatter, but tread under foot his people, so
   that their calamity would threaten an unavoidable destruction. This is
   one thing; but in the meantime he promises that there would be some
   saved. But he speaks of a remnant, as we have observed elsewhere, lest
   hypocrites should think that they could escape unpunished, while they
   trifled with God. The Prophet then shows that there would come such a
   calamity as would nearly extinguish the people, but that some would be
   preserved through God's mercy and that beyond ordinary expectation.
   [146] We now perceive the intention of the Prophet. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [143] lkn, Grotius renders it certè -- surely: but nevertheless, as
   proposed by Scott, is the most suitable particle here. Dathius gives
   this paraphrase -- Verum quidem est -- True indeed it is. -- Ed.

   [144] Until the time the begetting shall beget, (yvldh yldh)
   And the remnant of his brethren shall be converted
   Together with the children of Israel. Newcome gives this explanation of
   the verse, -- "The sense is: God will not fully vindicate and exalt his
   people, till the Virgin-mother shall have brought forth her Son; and
   till Judah and Israel, and all the true sons of Abraham among their
   brethren, the Gentiles, be converted to Christianity." -- Ed.

   [145] By this arrangement of the sentence, Calvin evidently meant, that
   "his," before "brethren," refers to "Israel." In the original, the
   latter clause is before the former, but in Hebrew, as well as in other
   languages, the antecedent sometimes comes after its pronoun. -- Ed.

   [146] Most commentators differ from Calvin in their view of this verse,
   regarding it as a distinct prophecy of the Savior's birth. There are
   difficulties on both sides: but taking the whole context, especially
   the following verse, we can hardly resist the conclusion, that Christ,
   born of a Virgin, is the subject. Indeed, the whole of this chapter,
   notwithstanding the reference to the Assyrian, is not capable of a
   satisfactory explanation, without applying what is said to Christ and
   his Church. Some things, no doubt, in the history of the Jews, may be
   alluded to, or incidentally mentioned; but the full accomplishment must
   be looked for in the new dispensation. And it is a splendid prophecy,
   in words often derived from customs and incidents among the Jews, of
   the birth of the Savior, and the character and extent, and blessedness
   of his kingdom, and the destruction of his enemies. Newcome and Adam
   Clarke propose to divide the chapter after the first line in verse 5,
   thinking that a new subject is there introduced: but evidently the same
   subject, the Gospel dispensation, is continued to the end of the
   chapter. The Assyrian, the especial enemy of the ancient Church,
   designates the enemies of the Christian Church in all ages. "As
   Sennacherib's invasion," says Scott, "was not repelled by the ruler or
   chieftains of Israel: nor did the Jews ever invade or waste the
   Assyrian dominions; it seems evident, that these expressions must be
   understood as mystically intending other enemies and persecutors of the
   Church, who should be of the same spirit with Sennacherib and the
   Assyrians." Henry, who is much more learned critic and much profounder
   divine than what is commonly thought, agrees with Scott, and many
   others, in the interpretation of this chapter. -- Ed.

   Micah 5:4

   4. And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the Lord, in the
   majesty of the name of the Lord his God; and they shall abide: for now
   shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.

   4. Et stabit et pascet in virtute Jehovae, in magnificentia nominis
   Jehovae Dei sui; et habitabunt, quia nunc magnificabitur usque ad fines
   terrae.


   There is no doubt but that the Prophet continues here to speak of
   Christ; and though the Jews shamelessly pervert the whole Scripture,
   they yet cannot deny that Micah calls here the attention of all the
   godly to the coming of Christ, yea, of all who hope or desire to obtain
   salvation. This is certain. Let us now see what the Prophet ascribes to
   Christ.

   He shall stand, he says, and feed in the power of Jehovah The word,
   stand, designates perseverance, as though he had said, that it would
   not be for a short time that God would gather by Christ the remnant of
   the people; that it would not be, as it often happens, when some rays
   of joy shine, and then immediately vanish. The Prophet shows here that
   the kingdom of Christ would be durable and permanent. It will then
   proceed; for Christ will not only rule his Church for a few days, but
   his kingdom will continue to stand through unbroken series of years and
   of ages. We nor then understand the Prophet's object.

   He adds in the second place, He shall feed in the strength of Jehovah,
   in the greatness of the name of Jehovah his God; by which words he
   means, that there would be sufficient power in Christ to defend his
   Church. The Church, we know, is in this world subject to various
   troubles, for it is never without enemies; for Satan always finds those
   whom he induces, and whose fury he employs to harass the children of
   God. As then the Church of God is tossed by many tempests, it has need
   of a strong and invincible defender. Hence this distinction is now
   ascribed by our Prophet to Christ, -- that he shall feed in the
   strength of Jehovah, and in the majesty of his God. As to the word
   feed, it no doubt expresses what Christ is to his people, to the flock
   committed to him and to his care. Christ then rules not in his Church
   as a dreaded tyrant, who distresses his subjects with fear; but he is a
   Shepherd who gently deals with his flock. Nothing therefore can exceed
   the kindness and gentleness of Christ towards the faithful, as he
   performs the office of a Shepherd: and he prefers to be adorned with
   this, title, rather than to be called and deemed a kings, or to assume
   authority to himself. But the Prophet, on the other hand, shows, that
   the power of Christ would be dreadful to the ungodly and wicked. He
   shall feed, he says, -- with regard to his flock, Christ will put on a
   character full of gentleness; for nothing, as I have said can imply
   more kindness than the word shepherd: but as we are on every side
   surrounded by enemies, the Prophet adds, --

   He shall feed in the power of Jehovah and in the majesty of the name of
   Jehovah; that is as much power as there is in God, so much protection
   will there be in Christ, whenever it will be necessary to defend and
   protect the Church against her enemies. Let us hence learn that no less
   safety is to be expected from Christ, than there is of power in God.
   Now, since the power of God, as we confess, is immeasurable, and since
   his omnipotence far surpasses and swallows up all our conceptions, let
   us hence learn to extend both high and low all our hopes. -- Why so?
   Because we have a King sufficiently powerful, who has undertaken to
   defend us, and to whose protection the Father has committed us. Since
   then we have been delivered up to Christ's care and defense, there is
   no cause why we should doubt respecting our safety. He is indeed a
   Shepherd, and for our sake he thus condescended and refused not so mean
   a name; for in a shepherd there is no pomp nor grandeur. But though
   Christ, for our sake, put on the character of a Shepherd, and disowns
   not the office, he is yet endued with infinite power. -- How so?
   Because he governs not the Church after a human manner, but in the
   majesty of the name of his God [147]

   Now, that he subjects Christ to God, he refers to his human nature.
   Though Christ is God manifested in the flesh, he is yet made subject to
   God the Father, as our Mediator and the Head of the Church in human
   nature: he is indeed the middle Person between God and us. This then is
   the reason why the Prophet now says, that Christ has power, as it were,
   at the will of another; not that Christ is only man, but as he appears
   to us in the person of man, he is said to receive power from his
   Father; and this, as it has been said, with respect to his human
   nature. There is yet another reason why the Prophet has expressly added
   this, -- that we may know that Christ, as the protector of the Church,
   cannot be separated from his Father: as then God is God, so Christ is
   his minister to preserve the Church. In a word, the Prophet means that
   God is not to be viewed by the faithful, except through the intervening
   Mediator; and he means also that the Mediator is not to be viewed,
   except as one who receives supreme power from God himself and who is
   armed with omnipotence to preserve his people.

   He afterwards adds, They shall dwell; for he shall now be magnified to
   the extremities of the earth He promises a secure habitation to the
   faithful; for Christ shall be extolled to the utmost regions of the
   world. We here see that he is promised to foreign nations: for it would
   have been enough for Christ to exercise his supreme power within the
   borders of Judea, had only one nation been committed to his safe
   keeping. But as God the Father intended that he should be the author of
   salvation to all nations, we hence learn that it was necessary that he
   should be extolled to the utmost borders of the earth. But with regard
   to the word dwell, it is explained more fully in the next verse, when
   the Prophet says--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [147] "The Prophets prefaced their messages with, Thus saith the Lord;
   but Christ spoke not as a servant, but as a Son, Verily, verily, I say
   unto you: this was feeding in the majesty of the name of the Lord his
   God; all power was given him in heaven and earth, a power over all
   flesh, by the virtue of which he still rules in the majesty of the name
   of the Lord his God." -- Henry.

   Micah 5:5

   5. And this man shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into
   our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise
   against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.

   5. Et erit hic pax: Assur quum venerit in terram nostram, et quum
   calcaverit in palatiis nostris, tunc constituemus super eum septem
   pastores et octo principes hominum.


   Micah, as I have said, confirms his former statement. By the word
   dwell, he no doubt meant a quiet and peaceable inhabitation; as though
   he had said, that the children of God would, under Christ, be safe and
   secure. Now he adds, And he shall be our peace. It might have been
   asked, "Whence will come this secure dwelling? For the land has been
   very often wasted, and the people have been at length driven to exile.
   How then can we now venture to hope for what thou promises, that we
   shall be quiet and secure?" Because, he says, He shall be our peace;
   and we ought to be satisfied with the protection of the King whom God
   the Father has given us. Let his shadow, then, suffice us, and we shall
   be safe enough from all troubles. We now see in what sense the Prophet
   calls Christ the Peace of his people or of his Church; he so calls him
   because he will drive far away all hurtful things, and will be armed
   with strength and invincible power to check all the ungodly, that they
   may not make war on the children of God, or to prevent them in their
   course, should they excite any disturbances.

   We further know, that Christ is in another way our peace; for he has
   reconciled us to the Father. And what would it avail us to be safe from
   earthly annoyances, if we were not certain that God is reconciled to
   us? Except then our minds acquiesce in the paternal benevolence of God,
   we must necessarily tremble at all times, though no one were to cause
   us any trouble: nay, were all men our friends, and were all to applaud
   us, miserable still would be our condition, and we should toil with
   disquietude, except our consciences were pacified with the sure
   confidence that God is our Father. Christ then can be our peace in no
   other way than by reconciling God to us. But at the same time the
   Prophet speaks generally, -- that we shall lie safely under the shadow
   of Christ, and that no evil ought to be feared, -- that though Satan
   should furiously assail us, and the whole worth become mad against us,
   we ought yet to fear nothing, if Christ keeps and protects us under his
   wings. This then is the meaning, when it is said here that Christ is
   our peace.

   He afterwards subjoins, When the Assyrian shall come into our land, and
   when he shall tread in our palaces then we shall raise up against him
   or on him, seven shepherds and eighty princes of the people [148] The
   Prophet intimates that the Church of God would not be free from
   troubles, even after the coming of Christ: for I am disposed to refer
   this to the intervening time, though interpreters put another
   construction on the words of the Prophet. But this meaning, is far more
   suitable, -- that while the help which God promised was expected and
   yet suspended, the Assyrians would come, who would pass far and wide
   through the land of Israel. Hence he says, that though Assur should
   come to our land, and break through, with such force and violence that
   we could not drive him out, we shall yet set up for ourselves shepherds
   and princes against him. It must at the same time be observed, that
   this prophecy is not to be confined to that short time; for the Prophet
   speaks generally of the preservation of the Church before as well as
   after the coming of Christ; as though he said, -- "I have said that the
   king, who shall be born to you, and shall go forth from Bethlehem,
   shall be your peace; but before he shall be revealed to the world, God
   will gather his Church, and there shall emerge as from a dead body
   Princes as well as Shepherds, who will repel unjust violence, nay, who
   will subdue the Assyrians."

   We now see what the prophet had in view: After having honored Christ
   with this remarkable commendation -- that he alone is sufficient to
   give us a quiet life, he adds that God would be the preserver of his
   Church, so as to deliver it from its enemies. But there is a
   circumstance here expressed which ought to be noticed: Micah says, that
   when the Assyrians shall pass through the land and tread down all the
   palaces, God would then become the deliverer of his people. It might
   have been objected, and said, "Why not sooner? Would it have been
   better to prevent this? Why! God now looks as it were indifferently on
   the force of the enemies, and loosens the reins to them, that they
   plunder the whole land, and break through to the very middle of it. Why
   then does not God give earlier relief?" But we see the manner in which
   God intends to preserve his Church: for as the faithful often need some
   chastisement, God humbles them when it is expedient, and then delivers
   them. This is the reason why God allowed such liberty to the Assyrians
   before he supplied assistance. And we also see that this discourse is
   so moderated by the Prophet, that he shows, on the one hand, that the
   Church would not always be free from evils, -- the Assyrians shall
   come, they shall tread down our palaces, -- this must be endured by
   God's children, and ought in time to prepare their minds to bear
   troubles; but, on the other hand, a consolation follows; for when the
   Assyrians shall thus penetrate into our land, and nothing shall be
   concealed or hidden from them, then the Lord will cause new shepherds
   to arise.

   The Prophet means that the body of the people would be for some time
   mutilated and, as it were, mangled; and so it was, until they returned
   from Exile. For he would have said this to no purpose, We shall set up
   for ourselves, if there had been an unbroken succession of regular
   government; he could not have said in that case, After Assur shall come
   into our land, we shall set up princes; but, There shall be princes
   when Assur shall come. The word set up denotes then what I have stated,
   -- that the Church would be for a time without any visible head. Christ
   indeed has always been the Head of the Church; but as he designed
   himself to be then seen in the family of David as in an image or
   picture, so the Prophet shows here, that though the faithful would have
   to see the head cut off and the Church dead, and like a dead body cast
   aside, when torn from its head; yea, that though the Church would be in
   this state dreadfully desolated, there is yet a promise of a new
   resurrection. We shall then set up, or choose for ourselves shepherds.

   If any one raises an objection and says that it was God's office to
   make shepherds for his people, -- this indeed I allow to be true: but
   this point has not been unwisely mentioned by the Prophet; for he
   extols here the favor of God, in granting again their liberty to his
   people. In this especially consists the best condition of the people,
   when they can choose, by common consent, their own shepherds: for when
   any one by force usurps the supreme power, it is tyranny; and when men
   become kings by hereditary right, it seems not consistent with liberty.
   [149] We shall then set up for ourselves princes, says the Prophet;
   that is, the Lord will not only give breathing time to his Church, and
   will also cause that she may set up a fixed and a well-ordered
   government, and that by the common consent of all.

   By seven and eight, the Prophet no doubt meant a great number. When he
   speaks of the calamities of the Church, it is aid, There shall not be
   found any to govern, but children shall rule over you.' But the Prophet
   says here that there would be many leaders to undertake the care of
   ruling and defending the people. The governors of the people shall
   therefore be seven shepherds and eight princes; that is, the Lord will
   endure many by his Spirit, that they shall be suddenly wise men: though
   before they were in no repute, though they possessed nothing worthy of
   great men, yet the Lord will enrich them with the spirit of power, that
   they shall become fit to rule. The Prophet now adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [148] The order of the words in Hebrew is not strictly observed in this
   instance. There is here an example, not infrequent in the prophets, of
   the nominative case absolute, -- And he shall be our peace:
   The Assyrian--when he shall come into our land,
   And when he shall tread in our palaces,
   The raise shall we against him
   Seven shepherds and eight anointed men. nsyky 'dm, literally anointed
   of men; but it is a phrase signifying men in authority, princes or
   sovereigns. nsykym is rendered dukes in Joshua 13:21, and princes in
   Psalm 83:11, and Ezekiel 32:30. It is not necessary to say "eight
   princes of men," but, "eight princes," or "eight anointed men." -- Ed.

   [149] It is by no means a safe rule, to draw a conclusion from the
   spiritual government as to what a temporal government should be. The
   subjects are guided by very different principles; and the same sort of
   government will not suit countries under different degrees of
   civilization. To theorize on this subject, as on many others, leads
   often to wrong conclusions. An hereditary sovereignty may seem to
   trench on liberty; but our own country exhibits an example where both
   exist to an extent unknown in the present or in any former age. Under
   no democracy has liberty ever been so freely and so fully enjoyed as in
   this land, which has been so wonderfully favored by a kind and gracious
   Providence. We owe, perhaps, far more than we are aware to an
   hereditary sovereignty. -- Ed.

   Micah 5:6

   6. And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the
   land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver us from
   the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within
   our borders.

   6. Et pascent terram Assur (hoc est, vastabunt; nam metaphorice hic
   pascere accipitur pro perdere quemadmodum dicuntur pecora pascere
   agrum, hoc est quum denudant herba sua; atque ita pastorum ingluviem
   notat in vorando populo; et alludit ad nomen illud quo usus fuerat:
   dixerat enim rvym septem pastores; nunc dicit rh; Videmus ergo
   Prophetam alludere ad nomen illud quod posuerat: pascent ergo terram
   Assur) gladio, et terram Nimrod in gladiis suis: et liberabit ab Assur,
   ubi venerit in terram nostram, et ubi calcaverit in finibus nostris.


   In this verse the Prophet says, that the shepherds, chosen by the
   Church, after it had been miserably oppressed by the tyranny of its
   enemies, would have a twofold office. They shall first feed; that is,
   nourish the Church of God; -- and, secondly, they shall feed; that is,
   destroy the land of Asshur, so that nothing may remain there whole and
   entire. God will then arm these shepherds with warlike courage; for
   they must fight boldly and courageously against their enemies: he says,
   They shall feed on the land of Nimrod with their swords Nimrod, we
   know, reigned in Chaldea; and we know also that the ten tribes were led
   away by Shalmanezer, and that the kingdom of Israel was thus
   demolished: when the Chaldeans obtained the empire, the kingdom of
   Judah was also laid waste by them. Now the import of the words is, that
   these shepherds would be sufficiently strong to oppose all the enemies
   of the Church, whether they were the Babylonians or the Assyrians. And
   he names the Assyrians and Babylonians, because they had then a contest
   with the people of God; and this continued to the coming of Christ,
   though it is certain that they suffered more troubles from Antiochus
   than from others: but as he was one of the successors of Alexander, the
   Prophet here, taking a part for the whole, means, by the Assyrians and
   Chaldeans, all the enemies of the Church, whoever they might be. Waste,
   he says, shall these shepherds the land of Asshur by the sword, and the
   land of Nimrod, and that by their swords [150]

   But this shall not be until the Chaldeans and the Assyrians shall
   penetrate into our land, and tread in our borders The Prophet again
   reminds the faithful, that they stood in need of patience, and that
   they were to know that God had not made a vain promise. The import of
   the whole is, that no deliverance was to be expected from God's hand
   until the faithful yielded their necks to his yoke, and patiently
   sustained the evils which were then approaching. The Prophet then
   mentions the intervening time between that state in which the Jews
   gloried and their deliverance. Why so? Because they were soon after to
   be smitten heavily by God's hand; but this, as we have seen, they did
   not think would take place. Hence he says, -- "Since you cannot yet be
   made to believe that merited punishment is nigh you, experience shall
   be your teacher. In the meantime, let the faithful provide themselves
   with courage and, with a meek heart, patiently to submit to God, the
   righteous Judge: but, at the same time, let them expect a sure
   deliverance, when they shall have gone through all their evils; for
   when the ripened time shall come, the Lord will look on his Church; but
   she must be first afflicted."

   adopting this meaning; besides, the word itself is nowhere found in
   this sense. This verse is connected with the preceding, and ought to be

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast from the beginning so defended
   thy Church, that thou hast never wholly forsaken her, and though it had
   nearly rejected thee by its defections, yet it has been thy pleasure to
   stand firm to thy covenant, and to show to it thy favor through all
   ages, until at length the everlasting Redeemer of the whole world
   appeared, -- O grant, that we may experience the same favor at this
   day, and though we have in various ways provoked thy wrath against us,
   yet do thou so humble us, that thou mayest sustain us by thy hand; and
   may we so recumb on those promises which we find in Scripture, that we
   may at length by our patience overcome our enemies, and in patience
   possess our souls, until thou raisest up thine hand, and slowest that
   invincible power which thou hast given to thy only-begotten Son, that
   he might repress the devil and all the wicked, and preserve us safe and
   secure from all injuries. Amen.

   Micah 5:7-8

   7. And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a
   dew from the Lord, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for
   man, nor waiteth for the sons of men.

   7. Et erit residuum Jacobin gentibus, in medio populorum multorum (vel,
   magnorum,) sicut ros a Jehova, sicut stillae super herbam, quae non
   expectat hominem, neque sperat in filiis hominum.

   8. And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of
   many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion
   among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, both treadeth down,
   and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.

   8. Et erit residuum Jacob in gentibus, in medio populorum multorum
   (vel, magnorum, ut diximus,) sicut leo inter animalia sylvae, sicut
   leunculus inter greges ovium, qui si transierit et discerpserit et
   repuerit, nemo eripiet.


   Micah promises here two things as to the future state of the Church, --
   that God shall defend it without the help and aid of men, -- and that
   he will supply it with strength, so that it will become superior to all
   enemies. In the first place, to show that the preservation of the
   Church depends on the mere favor of God, and that there is no need of
   any earthly aids, he makes use of a most suitable similitude; he says,
   that the people of God are like a dewy meadow. The Prophet speaks not
   what is strictly correct; for what he says of the rain and dew is to be
   applied to the grass or the meadow. [151] The residue of Jacob, he
   says, shall be as dew from Jehovah, and drops of rain on the grass.
   This cannot be applied according to the design of the Prophet, except
   you take the dew, as I have already said, for the dewy meadows or for
   the grass, which draws moisture and vigor from the rains. The sense
   indeed is by no means obscure, which is, -- that God will make his
   people to grow like the grass, which is fed only by celestial dew,
   without any culture or labor on the part of men: and this is also what
   the Prophet expressly mentions; for he says, that the grass of which he
   speaks waits not for men, nor grows through men's care, but grows
   through the dew of heaven.

   But that we may better understand the Prophet's intention, I shall
   briefly notice the words. There shall be, he says, the residue of Jacob
   He shows here that the whole people would not he preserved; for he had
   before spoken of their destruction. We hence see that this promise is
   to be confined to the seed, which God had wonderfully preserved in the
   calamitous state of the Church, yea, even in its almost total
   destruction. Then this promise belongs not to the whole body of the
   people, but to a small number; and hence he uses as before, the word
   s'ryt, sharit, a remnant or residue. There shall then be the residue of
   Jacob; [152] that is, though the people shall nearly all perish, yet
   there shall be some residue.

   He then adds, Among great or many nations There is here a contrast
   between the remnants and great nations: and the Prophet has not
   unnecessarily added the expression vqrv, bekoreb, in the midst. There
   are then three things to be observed here, -- that God does not promise
   deliverance to the whole people, but to a residue only, -- and then,
   that he promises this deliverance among powerful or many nations, as
   though he said, -- "Though the Church of God shall not excel in number,
   nay, so great may be the number of its enemies, as to be sufficient to
   overwhelm it, yet God will cause it to grow and to propagate: in a
   word, its enemies, though many in number, and strong in force and
   power, shall not yet hinder the Lord, that he should not increase his
   Church more and more;" -- and the third particular is what the
   expression, in the midst, intimates, and that is, that the people of
   God shall be besieged on every side. When enemies come upon us only
   from one part, it is not so very distressing, but when they surround
   us, being in front, and behind, and on both sides, then our condition
   seems miserable indeed; for when they thus press on us on all sides,
   they hardly allow us time to draw our breath. But the Prophet declares,
   that though surrounded on all sides by enemies, yet the Church would be
   safe.

   He now adds, ktl m't yhvh, cathel meat Ieve, As a dew from Jehovah;
   that is, it shall be, as I have said, as the grass, which is nourished
   and grows by means of dew from heaven, and as grass, which flourishes,
   not through the culture or labor of men, but which God himself makes to
   grow. He might have merely said, as the dew, but he adds, from Jehovah,
   that he might make a distinction between God and man, and show that the
   power of God is alone sufficient to support and sustain the Church,
   though men brought no assistance. And this is expressed more clearly in
   the next clause, when he says, As drops of rain on the grass, which
   waits not for man, nor tarries for the sons of men. We now then see
   that the faithful have their attention called to God alone, that they
   may understand that they are to be safe through his favor, that if all
   helps on earth failed, they ought not to fear, since they can be
   effectually sustained by the power of God alone: for God makes grass to
   grow on mountains and in meadows without the help and labor of man; and
   thus he can defend his Church without any foreign aid, but by his own
   hidden, and, so to speak, his own intrinsic power.

   Then follows this promise, -- that God will arm his people with
   invincible and irresistible power, that they may be superior to all
   their enemies. Hence he says, that the residue of Israel shall be like
   a lion among the beasts of the forests and like a young lion among a
   flock of sheep As a strong lion then is superior to other beasts, and
   as a young lion dares ferociously to attack a flock of sheep; so he
   says, the people of Israel shall be; they shall be like lions, filling
   their enemies with terror, yea, and plundering and scattering them, so
   that no one will dare to resist them. The Prophet, by speaking thus,
   does not mean, that the people of God would be cruel and sanguinary:
   for we know that when the Prophets use similes of this kind, they
   express something not strictly suitable; for who would be so foolish as
   to select every thing that belongs to a lion, and apply it to the
   Church of God. Then the reason for this similitude must be observed; it
   was to show, that the faithful shall be endued with a power so superior
   to that of their enemies, that they shall be a terror to them. It does
   not hence follow that they shall be cruel.

   But we must, at the same time, see what the Lord promises to his
   Church. Though God then recommends to his children the spirit of
   meekness, yet the faithful may still be a thread to their enemies; they
   ought, however, to observe what is just towards them, and to keep
   themselves within proper bounds. And yet Micah says, that they shall be
   endued with such power that they shall drive their enemies afar off;
   yea, that they shall plunder and tear them in pieces, while no one will
   be able to resist them. [153] But these two things are necessary as to
   the preservation of the Church, that God may make it grow; for except
   it be miraculously increased, it can never grow; and then it has need
   of a strong and powerful defense against her enemies; for we know that
   there are always wicked men who oppose the Church, yea, who apply all
   their powers to destroy it: it is therefore necessary that it should be
   supplied by the Lord with invincible strength, as our Prophet declares
   here. Let us proceed --

   [151] There seems to be no necessity for this supposed inaccuracy in
   this comparison; it indeed changes the obvious meaning of the passage.
   The Jews are compared to the dew and rain, through which the grass
   grows; and then it is said, that the growth of the grass, not the dew
   or the rain, is not dependent on man, but on the dew or rain. The
   comparison is thus in every way suitable. -- Ed.

   [152] We have the residue or remnant of Joseph in Amos 5:15,--the
   remnant of Israel in Micah 2:12, -- and here in the following verse,
   the remnant of Jacob. -- Ed.

   [153] "They shall be bold as a lion in witnessing against the
   corruptions of the times and places they live in, and strong as a lion
   in the strength of the Lord, to resist and overcome their spiritual
   enemies. The weapons of their warfare are mighty through God, to the
   pulling down of strongholds, 2 Corinthians 10:4,5. They shall have
   courage which all their adversaries shall not be able to resist, Luke
   21:15." -- Henry.

   Micah 5:9

   9. Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine
   enemies shall be cut off.

   9. Exaltabitur manus tua super hostes tuis, et cuncti, adversarii tui
   excidentur.


   He confirms what is said in the last verse, and expresses in other
   words what he meant, and what we have explained, -- that though the
   Church must contend with many strong and violent enemies, it will not
   yet fail, for the Lord will supply it with strength from heaven.
   Exalted, he says, shall be thy hand, that all thine enemies may be cut
   off He promises not that the Church shall be in a quiet state, but
   victorious, and declares also that there will never be wanting enemies.
   This promise, then, ought to arm us for enduring patiently, as we
   cannot conquer except by fighting. As then there will be always enemies
   to oppose the Church of God; yea, to attempt its ruin, the Prophet says
   here, Exalted shall be thy hand above thine enemies.

   But it may be asked, When has this promise been fulfilled? For we know
   that since the people had been led away into the Babylonian exile, they
   had always been either tributaries, or kept under cruel tyranny, or at
   least had been unequal to their enemies. But this principle ought ever
   to be remembered, -- that the faithful ought to be satisfied with
   victory, -- that however hard they may be pressed, and however constant
   may be the contests which they have to carry on, and however wearisome,
   this one thing ought still to be sufficient for them -- that they shall
   not wholly perish. And it appears evident, that God's people have
   always been preserved by his invincible hand, however numerous have
   been their opposing enemies. We must also keep in mind what we have
   just heard, -- that the promise here is not made to the whole people,
   but to a residue only. And it surpasses the expectation of the whole
   world, that even a small member could have survived so many slaughters,
   by which they might have been swallowed up a hundred times. Now then we
   see that it had not been without reason promised to the faithful, that
   they should be made conquerors over all their enemies. But this has not
   been really fulfilled, except under the conflict of the cross. It now
   follows --

   Micah 5:10-15

   10. And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that I will
   cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy
   chariots:

   10. Et accidet in die illo, dicit Jehova, excidam equos tuos e medio
   tui, et perdam quadrigas tuas;

   11. And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy
   strong holds:

   11. Et excidam urbes terrae tuae, et evertam cunctas munitiones tuas;

   12. And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt
   have no more soothsayers:

   12. Et excidam angures (vel, divinos) e manu tua; et praestigiatores
   non erunt tibi (haec lengenda sunt in uno contextu;)

   13. Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out
   of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine
   hands.

   13. Et excidam scuptilia tua et statuas tuas e medio tui; et non
   adorabis amplius opus manuum tuarum;

   14. And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will I
   destroy thy cities.

   14. Et delebo lucos tuos e mediotui, et detraham hostes tuos (vel,
   urbes tuas; utroque enim verti potest;)

   15. And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen,
   such as they have not heard.

   15. Et faciam in ira et furore vindictam in gentibus quae non audierunt
   (vel, quam non audierunt; dicam de utroque.)


   There is introduced here a most necessary admonition, in order that the
   faithful may know, how they are to be preserved by the hand and favor
   of God, even when they shall be stripped of all their helps, yea, even
   when God shall take away all those impediments, which would otherwise
   close up the way against his favor. The sum of the whole then is, --
   that the Church shall not otherwise be saved by God's kindness than by
   being deprived of all her strength and defenses, and also by having her
   obstacles removed by God, even those which in a manner prevented his
   hand from being put forth to save his people. For the Prophet mentions
   here cities, then fortified places, he mentions horses and chariots.
   These, we know, are not in themselves to be condemned: but he means,
   that as the people foolishly placed confidence in earthly things, the
   salvation of God could not otherwise come to them than by stripping
   them of all vain and false confidence. This is one thing. Then, on the
   other hand, he mentions groves, he mentions carved images and statues,
   he mentions augurs and diviners: these were corruptions, which closed
   the door against the favor of God; for a people, given to idolatry,
   could not call upon God nor hope in him as the author of salvation. We
   now then perceive the Prophet's design. It now remains for me to run
   over the words.

   He says first, It shall be in that day, saith Jehovah, that I will cut
   off thine horses [154] Here the Prophet enumerates those things which
   could not in themselves be ascribed to any thing wrong: for as God has
   created horses for the use of men, so also he allows them to be for our
   service. Why then does the Prophet say, that the Church could not be
   delivered, except horses were taken away? It was owing to an accidental
   fault; for when men abound in forces, they instantly fix their hope on
   them. As then such an abuse of God's gifts had prevailed among the
   people of Israel, it was necessary that horses should be taken away.
   God indeed could have humbled their minds or withdrawn their confidence
   from their horses and chariots: but it hence appears how deep are the
   roots of presumption in the hearts of men, that they cannot be
   otherwise torn up, than by having the things themselves cut off. To
   have horses and to have chariots is the bounty of God: for how can we
   have chariots and horses and other things, except through God's
   kindness? And yet God cannot find a way by which he can do us good,
   except by taking away his former gifts. Here then Micah touches the
   hearts of the people much more sharply than before, when he says, that
   salvation cannot proceed from the Lord, except their horses were
   destroyed; as though he said, -- "Ye see how great is your wickedness;
   God has hitherto dealt bountifully with you, since he has enriched you,
   and has also given you horses. Now as he sees that you abuse these
   gifts, he complains that all ways of access to you are closed up, as ye
   do not receive his kindness. Inasmuch as your horses and your chariots
   engross your attention, ye in a manner drive God far away from you.
   That he may therefore come to you, he will open a way for himself by
   removing all the obstacles and hindrances."

   We hence learn, that though all God's benefits ought to raise us up to
   heaven, serving as kinds of vehicles, they are yet turned, through our
   wickedness, to another purpose, and are made intervening obstacles
   between us and God. Hereby then is our ingratitude proved; and hence it
   comes, that God, when he intends to make his salvation known to us is
   in a manner constrained to take away and remove from us his benefits.
   We now then understand what the Prophet had in view when he mentioned
   horses and chariots. For he does not threaten here, as some think, that
   the people would be merely deprived of all God's gifts that they might
   see in their destitution and want only signs of a curse; by no means,
   but it is rather a promise, that is, that God will turn aside all
   impediments by which he was for a time prevented from bringing help to
   his people. This doctrine ought at the same time to avail for bringing
   no ordinary comfort. It is hard and bitter to the flesh to be brought
   down. Hence the people of Israel were little able at first to bear
   their lot with submission, when they saw themselves stripped of God's
   benefits: but the Prophet sets before them a compensations which was
   capable of soothing all their grief, -- "This," he says, "shall be for
   your chief good -- that God will deprive you of horses and chariots;
   for the way which your horses and chariots now occupy shall be cleared.
   While ye are replenished with abundant forces, ye drive away God far
   from you, and there is no way open for him. He will therefore prepare a
   way for himself; and this will be the case when your land shall be made
   naked, when nothing will intervene to prevent him from coming to you."

   He afterwards subjoins, I will cut off the cities of thy land, and I
   will destroy all thy fortresses This verse is to be taken in the same
   sense. That the people dwelt in fortified cities, and had defenses and
   fortified places, was not of itself displeasing to God. But as the
   people habituated themselves to a false confidence, and as it were
   hardened themselves in it, so that this evil could not be remedied
   without taking away those things to which it is attached, the Prophet
   says here, I will cut off the cities of your land, and then, I will cut
   off your defenses and fortified places. Is it that they may be
   plundered with impunity by their enemies? By no means, but that the
   favor of God may be made glorious in their deliverance. For they could
   not ascribe it to their cities that they kept off enemies, but were
   constrained to acknowledge the hand of God, and to confess him to have
   been their only deliverer; for they were exposed to enemies, and there
   was no aid for them in the land. God then will thus render more evident
   his favor, when their cities and fortified places shall be cut off. We
   hence learn that the faithful at this day have no cause to murmur if
   they are without great riches, and if they are not formidable for the
   multitude of their horses, nor for the number and strength of their
   men. Why so? Because it is the Lord's will that we should be like
   sheep, that we might depend wholly on his power, and know that we
   cannot be otherwise safe than under his protection. This reason then
   ought to comfort us, that it may not be grievous to us, when we find
   that we are in the midst of wolves, and that we have no equal strength
   to contend with them; for even this destitution hardly extorts from us
   a real confession that our safety is in the hand of God. We are always
   proud. How would it be, were the Church at this day in a flourishing
   state and all enemies subdued, were there no danger, no fear? Surely
   earth and heaven could not bear the foolish self-confidence of men.
   There is therefore no wonder that God thus holds us in, and that while
   he supports us by his grace, he deprives us of all earthly helps and
   aids, that we may learn that he alone is the author of our salvation.

   This truth ought to be carefully contemplated by us. Whenever we see
   that the Church of God, though not possessing any great power, is yet
   diminished daily, yea, and becomes, so to speak, like a naked land,
   without any defenses, it so happens, in order that the protection of
   God may be alone sufficient for us, and that he may wholly tear away
   from our hearts all haughtiness and pride, and dissipate all those vain
   confidences by which we not only obscure the glory of God, but, as far
   as we can, entirely cover it over. In short, as there is nothing better
   for us than to be preserved by the hand of God, we ought to bear
   patiently the removal of all those impediments which close up the way
   against God, and, in a manner, keep off his hand from us, when he is
   ready to extend it for the purpose of delivering us. For when our minds
   are inflated with foolish self-confidence, we neglect God; and thus a
   wall intervenes, which prevents him to help us. Who would not wish,
   seeing himself in extreme danger and help not far distant, that an
   intercepting wall should immediately fall down? Thus God is near at
   hand, as he has promised; but there are many walls and many obstacles,
   from the ruin of which, if we would be safe, we must desire and seek,
   that God may find an open and free way, in order that he may be able to
   afford us aid.

   The Prophet comes now to the second kind of impediments. We have
   already said that some things become impediments, as it were,
   accidentally, when, through our wickedness and misapplication, we turn
   God's benefits to an end contrary to what he has designed. If, for
   instance, horses and chariots are given us, to possess them is not in
   itself an evil, but becomes so through our blindness, that is, when we,
   blinded by earthly possessions, think ourselves safe, and thus neglect
   God. But there are other impediments, which are, in their nature, and
   in themselves, vicious. To these the Prophet now leads us.

   I will cut off, he says, the sorcerers, ksphym, cashephim [155] Some
   render the word jugglers, and others, augurs or diviners. We cannot
   know of a certainty what kind of superstition it was, nor the other
   which immediately follows: [156] for the Prophet mentions here two
   words which mean nearly the same thing. There is no doubt but that
   some, in that age, were called augurs or diviners, and others called
   jugglers or astrologers who are now called fortune-tellers. But on this
   subject there is no necessity of much labor; for the Prophet simply
   shows here that the people could not be preserved by Gods unless they
   were cleansed from these defilements. These superstitions, we know,
   were forbidden and condemned by God's Law: but the Law was not able to
   restrain the wickedness of that people; for they continually turned
   aside to these evils. God then here shows, that until they had purged
   the Church, it could not continue safe. Now, in these words, the
   Prophet reminds the Jews, and also the Israelites, for their benefit,
   that it was, and had been, through their own fault, that they labored
   under constant miseries and were not helped by the hand of God. -- How
   so? Because there was no room, as God shows here, for the exercise of
   his favor; for they were full of auguries and divinations, and of other
   diabolical arts. "How," he says, "can I help you, for I have no
   agreement with Satan? As you are wholly given to wicked superstitions,
   my favor is rejected by you." [157]

   One thing is, that the Prophet intended to humble the people, so that
   every one might know that it had been through their fault, that God had
   not brought them help as they wished: but there is another thing, --
   God promises a cleansing, which would open a way for his favor, -- I
   will take away, he says, all the diviners Let us then know, that it
   ought to be deemed the greatest benefit when God takes away from us our
   superstitions and other vices. For since a diminution, however hard and
   grievous it may be at first, is useful to us, as we see, when we
   willfully and openly drive away God from us; is it not a singular favor
   in God when he suffers us not to be thus separated from him, but
   prepares a way for himself to be connected with us, and has ever his
   hand extended to bring us help? Thus much as to these two kinds of
   impediments.

   He now adds, I will cut off thy graven images and thy statues from the
   midst of thee; and thou shalt not hereafter bend down before the works
   of thine hands This verse is plain and contains nothing new: for the
   Prophet teaches that God cannot become propitious to his Church, to
   keep and make her safe, until he purges her from her filth, even from
   idolatry and other vices, by which the worship of God was corrupted, or
   even entirely subverted. I will, therefore, cut off thy graven images
   and statues [158] from the midst of thee We see that God anticipates us
   by his gratuitous goodness, not only by forgiving us, but also by
   calling us back, when wandering, into the right way. Since then we have
   deviated from the right way, and God thus withdraws his hand that it
   might appear that he has cast us away it is certain that we ought not
   only to pray him to have mercy on us, but also to ascribe to him a
   higher favor, inasmuch as he takes away the very impediments which
   separate us from him, and suffer him not to come nigh us. We hence see
   that God is not only inclined to pardon when men repent, but that it is
   his peculiar office to remove the obstacles.

   This ought to be carefully noticed, that we may know that our
   salvation, from the first beginning, proceeds from the mere favor of
   God, -- and that we may also learn, that all those things, of which the
   Papists vainly talk respecting preparations, are mere figments.

   He then adds, thou shalt not bend hereafter before the work of thine
   hands. God expresses here the cause why he so much abominates idols,
   even because he sees that his honor is transferred to them: this is one
   thing. He further arraigns the Jews as guilty, while he makes evident
   their defection: for surely nothing could have been more shameful, than
   to take away from God his honor and worship, and to transfer them to
   dead things; and he says here by way of reproach, that they were the
   work of their hands. What can be more insane, than for men to ascribe
   divinity to their own inventions, or to believe that it is in the power
   of men to make a god from wood or stone? This is surely monstrous in
   the extreme. Then the Prophet by this form of speaking aggravates the
   sin of the people of Israel, that is, when he says that they bowed the
   head before the work of their oven hands.

   He afterwards subjoins, I will take away thy groves. The groves, we
   know, formed a part of their idolatry: they are therefore mentioned
   here as an addition by the Prophet. For he speaks not simply of trees,
   but refers to the wicked practices of the people: for wherever there
   were high and lofty trees, they thought that something divine was hid
   under their shade; hence their superstition. When therefore the Prophet
   mentions groves, it must be understood of vicious and false modes of
   worship; for they thought that those places acquired a sort of sanctity
   from the trees; as they also thought that they were nearer to God when
   they were on a hill. We hence see that this verse is to be connected
   with the last; as though the Prophet had said, that the Church could
   not be in safety and recover her pristine vigor, without being well
   cleansed from all the filth of idolatry. For we indeed know that some
   pious kings when they took away idols did not cut down the groves; and
   this exception to their praise is added, that they worshipped God, but
   that the high places were suffered to stand. We see that the Holy
   Spirit does not fully commend those kings who did not destroy the
   groves. -- Why? Because they were the materials of corruption. And
   further, had the Jews been really penitent, they would have
   exterminated those groves by which they had so shamefully abused and
   profaned the worship of God. The sum of the whole then is, that when
   God shall have well cleansed his Church and wiped away all its stains,
   he will then become the unfailing preserver of its safety. [159]

   He afterwards subjoins, And I will destroy thy enemies ryk, orik, may
   be rendered, enemies, and many so render it: but others translate it,
   cities; and the word, cities, would be the most suitable, were it not
   that the Prophet had previously mentioned cities. I do not therefore
   see that it would be proper to render it here by this term. The word
   ryk, orik, then, ought doubtless to be rendered, thy enemies. Let us
   inquire why the prophet says, that the enemies of the Church were to be
   destroyed. This sentence ought to be thus explained, (I leave the
   former ones, and take only this the last,) And I will demolish thy
   groves from the midst of thee, that I may destroy thine enemies: [160]
   the copulative is then to be considered as a final particle; and this
   meaning is the most suitable; as though the Prophet had said, as I have
   already often stated, that the door was closed against God, so that he
   could bring no aid to his Church, and deliver it from enemies, as long
   as it held to false confidence, and was attached to the filth of
   idolatry, which was still worse. "That I may then destroy thine
   enemies, it is necessary first that every thing in thee that prevents
   or hinders my favor should be taken away and removed."

   At last he adds, And I will execute vengeance in wrath and in fury He
   goes on with what I have just said of enemies; "I will then execute
   vengeance in wrath and in fury on the nations". Here God mentions his
   wrath and his fury, that the faithful might feel greater confidence,
   that though now their enemies poured forth grievous threatening, yet
   this could not prevent God from aiding his people. -- How so? Because
   if we compare the wrath and fury of God with all the terrors of men,
   doubtless the threats of men would appear as nothing but smoke. We now
   perceive the Prophet's meaning in these words. And he says in the last
   place, I will execute vengeance on the nations who have not heard.
   Almost all interpreters join the relative, 'sr, asher with the
   preceding word, gvym, guim, -- I will then take vengeance on the
   nations who have not heard, that is, who have been rebellious against
   God: not to hear, as they explain, is obstinately to despise the power
   of God, and not to be moved by his promises or by his threatenings. But
   a fitter sense may perhaps be elicited, if we refer 'sr, asher, to
   vengeance, -- I will then execute vengeance on the nations which they
   have not heard, that is, I will take vengeance on all the nations in a
   manner unheard of and incredible: and by nations, he understands
   indiscriminately all the enemies of the Church, as we have elsewhere
   seen.

   [154] As a curious instance of ingenuity and extravagance in
   allegorizing, practiced by some of the Fathers, Jerome's interpretation
   of this verse may be mentioned: the horses were lascivious lusts; the
   chariots, sins joined together in which the wicked, as it were, ride
   and triumph; the cities, such as that built by Cain, not like the
   heavenly Jerusalem; and the strongholds, were riches and the pomps of
   the world, the eloquence of orators and the tenterhooks of
   dialecticians! -- Ed.

   [155] From ksph. "In Arabic," says Parkhurst, "the verb signifies to
   discover, disclose, reveal, and is always in the Hebrew Bible applied
   to some species of conjuring." The Septuagint render the word here
   pharmaka, drugs or charms. They were enchanters or sorcerers, who
   applied drugs to magical purposes. See 2 Chronicles 33:6. -- Ed.

   [156] The word here is mvnnym, from nn, a cloud. Parkhurst renders it
   cloudmongers, who looked upwards to the clouds either on the flight of
   birds, or on the stars, or on meteors, and thereby pretended to
   foretell future things. Apophthengomenous -- oraclers -- Sept.
   Theodoret renders it manteis -- soothsayers; and Cyril pseudomanteis --
   false prophets. Some derive it from nh, to answer; and others from yn,
   the eye; and hence, eyers or observers, either of times, or dreams, or
   of stars, or of birds. -- Ed.

   [157] "Many of them depended much upon the conduct and advice of their
   conjurors, diviners, and fortune-tellers, and these God will cut off,
   not only as weak things, and insufficient to relieve them, but as
   wicked things, and sufficient to ruin them." -- Henry.

   [158] mtsvvt, rather pillars or columns than statues: tas stelas in the
   Sept. The pillar of stone which Jacob set up is called by this name,
   Genesis 28:18. They were commemorative pillars at which the Canaanites,
   and afterwards the Jews, offered idolatrous worship. There was a pillar
   of this kind in the house of Baal, 2 Kings 10:26, 27. They were not
   altars, though altars might have been reared by them, for both are
   mentioned together in Deuteronomy 12:3. The word is derived from ytsv,
   to set, to fix firmly. The noun is rendered by Parkhurst, a standing
   pillar. -- Ed.

   [159] Scott, speaking of the latter part of this chapter, says, "The
   reformation of the Jews after their return from Babylon might be
   alluded to; but the purification of the Christian Church from all
   antichristian corruptions of faith and worship, and all idolatry and
   superstition, seems more immediately to be predicted." -- Ed.

   [160] Newcome renders the word ryk, thine enemies, and not, thy cities,
   though he connects the verse differently, -- more with the last than
   with the former portion of this, -- I will also destroy thine enemies:
   15. And I will execute vengeance, in anger and in fury,
   Upon the nations which have not hearkened unto me.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that since thou so kindly invites us to thy self,
   and promises that thy aid should never be wanting to us, provided we do
   not close the door against thee, -- O grant, that though many earthly
   benefits may be granted to us, we may not yet trust in them and depart
   from thee, but, on the contrary, recomb on thy grace only: and then
   should it happen to us to be deprived of all helps, that our minds may
   be awakened, and that we may thus learn to hasten to thee, may nothing
   impede our course, that we may not, with the greatest haste and ardent
   desire, long to deliver up and devote ourselves wholly to thee, that we
   may be made safe under the care and protection of thy only-begotten
   Son, whom thou hast appointed to be the guardian of our safety. Amen.

   1. Hear ye now what the Lord saith; Arise, contend thou before the
   mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.

   1. Audite nunc (vel, quaeso) quod dicit Jehova, -- Surge, litiga coram
   montibus, et colles audiant vocem tuam:

   2. Hear ye, O mountains, the Lord's controversy, and ye strong
   foundations of the earth: for the Lord hath a controversy with his
   people, and he will plead with Israel.

   2. Audite montes disceptationem Jehovae, et fortia undamenta terrae:
   quia disceptatio Jehovae cum populo suo, et cum Israele contendet.


   Here the Prophet avowedly assumes that the people were sufficiently
   proved guilty; and yet they resisted through a hardiness the most
   obdurate, and rejected all admonitions without shame, and without any
   discretion. He is therefore commanded to direct his discourse to the
   mountains and to the hills; for his labor had now for a long time been
   useless as to men. The meaning then is that when the Prophet had spent
   much labor on the people and derived no fruit, he is at length bidden
   to call the mountains and the hills to bear their testimony to God; and
   thus before the elements is made known and proved the ungodliness and
   the obstinacy of the people. But before he relates what had been
   committed to him, he makes a preface, in order to gain attention.

   Hear ye what Jehovah says. The Prophets are wont, on very serious
   subjects, to make such a preface as is here made by Micah: and it is
   indeed sufficiently evident from the passage, that he has here no
   ordinary subject for his teaching, but that, on the contrary, he
   rebukes their monstrous stupidity; for he had been addressing the deaf
   without any advantage. As then the Prophet was about to declare no
   common thing, but to be a witness of a new judgment, -- this is the
   reason why he bids them to be unusually attentive. Hear, he says, what
   Jehovah saith. What is it? He might have added, "Jehovah has very often
   spoken to you, he has tried all means to bring you to the right way;
   but as ye are past recovery, vengeance alone now remains for you: he
   will no more spend labor in vain on you; for he finds in you neither
   shame, nor meekness, nor docility." The Prophet might have thus spoken
   to them; but he says that another thing was committed to his charge by
   the Lord, and that is, to contend or to plead before the mountains. And
   this reproach ought to have most acutely touched the hearts of the
   people: for there is here an implied comparison between the mountains
   and the Jews; as though the Prophet said, -- "The mountains are void of
   understanding and reason, and yet the Lord prefers to have them as
   witness of his cause rather than you, who exceed in stupidity all the
   mountains and rocks." We now then perceive the design of God.

   Some take mountains and hills in a metaphorical sense for the chief men
   who then ruled: and this manner of speaking very frequently occurs in
   Scripture: but as to the present passage, I have no doubt but that the
   Prophet mentions mountains and hills without a figure; for, as I have
   already said, he sets the hardness of the people in opposition to
   rocks, and intimates, that there would be more attention and docility
   in the very mountains than what he had hitherto found in the chosen
   people. And the particle 't, at, is often taken in the sense of before:
   it means also with; but in this place I take it for l, lamed, before or
   near, as many instances might be cited. But that this is the meaning of
   the Prophet it is easy to gather from the next verse, when he says --

   Hear, ye mountains, the controversy of Jehovah, [161] how? and ye
   strong foundations of the earth, he says. He speaks here no more of
   hills, but summons the whole world; as though he said, "There is not
   one of the elements which is not to bear witness respecting the
   obstinacy of this people; for the voice of God will penetrate to the
   farthest roots of the earth, it will reach the lowest depths: these men
   will at the same time continue deaf." And he says not, the Lord
   threatens you, or denounces judgment on you; but Jehovah has a
   contention with his people. We now then see that there is no metaphor
   in these words; but that the Prophet merely shows how monstrous was the
   stupor of the people, who profited nothing by the celestial doctrine
   delivered to them, so that the very mountains and the whole machinery
   of earth and heaven, though destitute of reason, had more understanding
   than these men. And it is not unusual with the Prophets, we know, to
   turn their discourse to mute elements, when there remains no hope of
   success from men. But our Prophet does not abruptly address mountains
   and hills as Isaiah does, (Isaiah 1:2,) and as also Moses had done,

   Hear, ye heavens, what I shall say, let the earth hear the words of my
   mouth,' (Deuteronomy 32:1,)

   but he prefaces his discourse by saying, that it had been specially
   commanded to him to summon the mountains and hills to God's judgment.
   By saying then, "Hear ye what Jehovah saith," he prepares as I have
   said, the Jews to hear, that they might know that something uncommon
   and altogether unusual was to be announced, -- that the Lord, in order
   more fully to convict them of extreme impiety, intended to plead his
   cause before the mountains.

   Arise, then, and plead before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy
   voice. What sort of voice was this? They who think that the judges are
   here figuratively pointed out may be easily refuted; for Micah in the
   next verse mentions the substance of this pleading, namely that the
   Lord expostulated with his people. We hence see that God had no
   contention with the mountains, but that, on the contrary, the mountains
   were summoned, that they might understand God's pleading, not against
   them, but against the people. Hear then, ye mountains, Jehovah's
   controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth, that is, the very
   rocks. There is nothing so hard in the world, he says, that shall not
   be inane to hear; for this pleading shall reach the lowest depths.
   Jehovah then has a controversy with his people, and he will plead, or
   contend, with Israel It follows --

   [161] Henry says, "Sin begets a controversy between God and man. The
   righteous God has an action against every sinner, an action of debt, an
   action of trespass, an action of slander."

   Micah 6:3

   3. O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied
   thee? testify against me.

   3. Popule mi, quid feci tibi? Et in quo exhibui tibi molestiam?
   Testificare contra me.


   Here God, in the first place, offers to give a reason, if he was
   accused of any thing. It seems indeed unbecoming the character of God,
   that he should be thus ready as one guilty to clear himself: but this
   is said by way of concession; for the Prophet could not otherwise
   express, that nothing that deserved blame could be found in God. It is
   a personification, by which a character; not his own, is ascribed to
   God. It ought not therefore to appear inconsistent, that the Lord
   stands forth here, and is prepared to hear any accusation the people
   might have, that he might give an answer, My people! what have I done?
   By using this kind expression, my people, he renders double their
   wickedness; for God here descends from his own elevation, and not only
   addresses his people, in a paternal manner, but stands as it were on
   the opposite side, and is prepared, if the people had anything to say,
   to give answer to it, so that they might mutually discuss the question,
   as it is usually done by friends. Now the more kindly and indulgently
   the Lord deals with his people, the more enhanced, as I have said, is
   their sin.

   He says first, What have I done to thee? that is, what hast thou to
   accuse me with? He adds In what have I caused trouble [162] to thee?
   or, In what have I been troublesome to thee? Testify, he says, against
   me. This testifying was to be made to the mountains and hills; as
   though he said, "I am ready to plead my cause before heaven and earth;
   in a word, before all my creatures." Some render the passage, "Answer
   me:" and nh, one, is also to answer; but the context requires the
   former meaning; for God conceded so much liberty to the Jews, that they
   might bring forward against him any fault they had to allege. Testify,
   he says, against me; that is, there are witnesses present; make public
   now thy case by stating particulars, I am ready for the defense. We
   hence see the truth of what I have before stated, -- that a character,
   not his own is ascribed to God: but this is done by way of concession.
   He afterwards adds --

   Quo fatigavi te -- In what have I wearied thee? Jun. and Trem. Ti

   pressi -- with what labor have I oppressed thee? Jerome. This last
   contains the full meaning. -- Ed.

   Micah 6:4

   4. For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee
   out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and
   Miriam.

   4. Certe (vel, quia, vel, nempe quod ascendere te feci e terra AEgypti,
   et ex domo servorum redemi te, et misi coram te Mosen, Aaron, et
   Mariam.


   God, having testified that he had in nothing been troublesome to the
   people, now states with how great and with how many benefits he had
   bound them to himself. But we may prefer taking the words as
   explanatory and somewhat ironical that he records his benefits in the
   place of trouble or vexation; though, in my judgment, it is better to
   read the two clauses apart. I have brought thee, he says, from the land
   of Egypt, from that miserable bondage; and then he says, I have
   redeemed thee [163] By the word, redeem, he expresses more clearly and
   more fully illustrates his kindness. Then he adds, I have set over thee
   as leaders Moses, and Aaron, and Miriam, the sister of them both.
   Benefits, we know, are often accompanied with injuries; and he who
   obliges another destroys all his favor, when he turns kindness as it
   often happens, into reproach. It is hence frequently the case, that he
   who has been kind to another brings so serious an injury, that the
   memory of his kindness ought not to continue. God mentions here these
   two things, -- that he had conferred vast benefits on the people, --
   and yet that he had in nothing been burdensome to them; as though he
   said "Many are those things which I can, if necessary, on my part bring
   forward, by which I have more than a hundred times made thee indebted
   to me; now thou canst not in thy turn bring anything against me; thou
   canst not say that I have accompanied my benefits with wrongs, or that
   thou hast been despised, because thou were under obligations to me, as
   it is often the case with men who proudly domineer, when they think
   that they have made others bound to them. I have not then thought
   proper to accompany my great favors with anything troublesome or
   grievous to thee." We now understand why the Prophet expressly mentions
   these two things, -- that God had in nothing been vexatious to his
   people, -- and that he had brought them up from the land of Egypt.

   That redemption was so great, that the people ought not to have
   complained, had it been the will of God to lay on their shoulders some
   very heavy burdens: for this answer might have been ever readily given,
   -- "Ye have been delivered by me; ye owe to me your life and your
   safety. There is therefore no reason why any thing should be now
   burdensome to you; for the bondage of Egypt must have been bitterer to
   you than hundred deaths; and I redeemed you from that bondage." But, as
   the Lord had treated his redeemed people so kindly and so humanely,
   yea, with so much indulgence, how great and how intolerable was their
   ingratitude in not responding to his great kindness? We now more fully
   understand the Prophet's meaning in these words.

   I have made thee to ascend, he says, from Egypt; and then, I have
   redeemed thee. He goes on, as we have said, by degrees. He afterwards
   adds, I have sent before thy face Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. God means
   here that it had not been a momentary kindness; for he continued his
   favor towards the Jews when he set over them Moses and Aaron, and
   Miriam, which was an evidence of his constant care, until he had
   completed his work of delivering them. For Moses was a minister of
   their deliverance in upholding civil order, and Aaron as to the
   priesthood and spiritual discipline. With regard to Miriam, she also
   performed her part towards the women; and as we find in Exodus 15, she
   composed a song of thanksgiving after passing through the Red Sea: and
   hence arose her base envy with regard to Moses; for being highly
   praised, she thought herself equal to him in dignity. It is at the same
   time right to mention, that it was an extraordinary thing, when God
   gave authority to a woman, as was the case with Deborah that no one may
   consider this singular precedent as a common rule. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [163] The complete sentence is, "from the house of servants," or
   rather, slaves: for they were not properly what we call servants, but
   slaves, in Egypt. The Septuagint has ex oikou douleias -- from the
   house of slavery. "The house of slaves," is the version both of Newcome
   and of Henderson. They are the same words as we find in Exodus 20:2,
   rendered, "out of the house of bondage;" which ought to be translated
   slavery rather than bondage, if we depart from the literal rendering --
   the house of slaves. -- Ed.

   Micah 6:5

   5. O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and
   what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that
   ye may know the righteousness of the Lord.

   5. Popule mi, recordare nunc (vel, quaeso, est eadem particula) quid
   cogitaverit Balak, rex Moab, et quid responderit ei Balaam, filius
   Beor, a Sittim usque ad Gilgal, ut cognosceres (vel, cognoscas)
   justitias Jehovae.


   God briefly records here what happened in the desert, -- that the
   people had need of some extraordinary help in addition to the many
   benefits which he had conferred on them. For though the people lived
   safely in the desert as to the Egyptians, though they were fed by manna
   and water from the rock flowed for them, though the cloud by day
   protected them from the heat of the sun, and the pillar of fire shone
   on them during the night, yet the stream of God's mercy seemed to have
   been stopped when Balaam came forth, who was a Prophet, and then, as
   one armed with celestial weapons, fought against the people and opposed
   their deliverance. Now, had God permitted Balaam to curse the people,
   what could have taken place, but that they must have been deprived of
   all their blessings? This is the reason why the Prophet specifically
   refers to this history, -- that the cursing of Balaam was miraculously
   turned into a blessing, even through the secret purpose of God. Micah
   might indeed have referred to all those particulars by which God could
   have proved the ingratitude of the people; but he deemed it sufficient
   to touch on the fact of their redemption, and also to mention by the
   way this extraordinary instance of God's kindness.

   Remember, he says, what Balak devised, that is, how crafty was his
   counsel: for the verb yph, iots, is to be taken here in a bad sense,
   and is very emphatical; as though the Prophet had said, that there was
   more danger in this fraud than in all the violence of enemies; for
   Balak could not have done so much harm, had he prepared a great army
   against the Israelites, as by hiring a Prophet to curse the people. For
   certain it is, that though Balaam was an impostor and full of deceits,
   as it is probable that he was a man given to profane superstitions, he
   was yet endued with the gift of prophecy. This was the case no doubt;
   and we know that God has often so distributed the gifts of his Spirit,
   that he has honored with the prophetic office even the ungodly and
   unbelieving: for it was a special gift, distinct from the grace of
   regeneration. Balaam then was a Prophet. Now when Balak saw that he was
   unequal in power to oppose the people, he thought of this expedient --
   to get some Prophet to interpose for the purpose of exciting the wrath
   of God against the people. This is the reason why it is here said,
   Remember what Balak consulted against thee; that is, "Thou were then in
   the greatest danger, when a Prophet came, hired for the purpose, that
   he might in God's name pronounce on thee a curse."

   It may be asked, Whether Balaam could really curse the people of
   Israel? The answer is easy: the question here is not what might have
   been the effect, without God's permission; but Micah here regards only
   the office with which Balaam was honored and endued. As then he was
   God's Prophet, he could have cursed the people, had not God prevented
   him. And no doubt Balak was wise enough to know, that the Israelites
   could not be resisted by human power, and that, therefore, nothing
   remained for him but the interposition of God; and as he could not
   bring down God from heaven, he sent for a Prophet. God puts his own
   power in his word, -- as God's word resided in Balaam, and as he was,
   as it were, its depositary, it was no wonder that Balak thought that he
   would become the conqueror of the people of Israel, provided they were
   cursed by Balaam's mouth; for this would have been as it were, the
   announcement of God's wrath.

   He now subjoins, And what Balaam, the son of Beor, answered him. There
   is here shown, on the one hand, a danger, because Balaam was craftier
   than all the other enemies of the people, for he could have done more
   by his artifice than if he had armed against them the whole world: here
   then was the danger. But, on the other hand, we know what he answered;
   and it is certain that the answer of Balaam did not proceed from
   himself, but, on the contrary, from the Spirit of God. As Balaam spoke
   by the secret influence of the Spirit, contrary to the wish of his own
   heart, God thus proved that he was present at that very time, when the
   safety of the people was endangered. Think, then, or remember, what
   Balaam answered; as though he said, -- "Balaam was very nigh cursing
   thee, for his mouth was opened: for he had sold himself to an ungodly
   king, and nothing could have pleased him more than to have poured forth
   many anathemas and many curses: but he was constrained to bless your
   fathers. What did this mean? Did not the wonderful favor of God shine
   forth in this instance?" We now perceive the Prophet's design, and what
   a large meaning there is in these words.

   He afterwards adds generally, From Shittim even to Gilgal. This is not
   connected with the last clause; for Balaam did not follow the people
   from Shittim to Gilgal; but a verb is to be understood, [164] as though
   he said, -- "Thou knowest what things happened to thee from Shittim to
   Gilgal, from the beginning to the end; at the time when thou didst
   enter the wilderness, thou hadst begun to provoke the wrath of God."
   And we know that even in Shittim the Israelites fell away into
   idolatry; and that defection, in a manner, alienated them from God.
   Hence God shows here that he, in his goodness and mercy, had contended
   with the ungodly ways of the people even to Gilgal; that is, "Thou hast
   never ceased to provoke me." We indeed know that the people continually
   excited against themselves the displeasure of God, and that their
   defections were many and various. In short, then the Prophet shows that
   God had so mercifully dealt with the people, that he had, in a most
   astonishing manner, overcome their wickedness by his goodness.

   He at length subjoins, That thou mayest know the righteousnesses of
   Jehovah. By righteousnesses he means acts of kindness, as the sense of
   the word is in many other passages: for the righteousness of God is
   often taken not only for uprightness, but also for the faithfulness and
   truth which he manifests towards his people. It betokens therefore the
   relation between God and his Church, whenever the word, righteousness,
   is to be understood in this sense. That thou mayest then know the
   righteousnesses of Jehovah; that is, that experience itself may prove
   to thee how faithful, how beneficent, how merciful has God ever been
   towards your race. [165] Since then the righteousness of God was
   conspicuous, the people must surely have been mute, and had nothing for
   which they could justly expostulate with God: what remained, but that
   their extreme impiety, fully detected before heaven and earth and all
   the elements, exposed them to his judgment? It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [164] Various have been the ways to complete this evidently defective
   sentence; and there is no assistance from any MSS., or from the
   Septuagint. Shittim was in the land of Moab, and Gilgal was beyond
   Jordan, in the land of Canaan. Grotius and many others repeat the word
   "Remember," and supply, "what I have done," or, "what happened." This
   is a sort of omission, which we can hardly think a writer would have
   made. It is far more probable that a word or words have been somehow
   left out: and the Targum, though generally no safe guide, has so given
   the passage as to countenance this conjecture. "Were not great things
   done for you," is the supplement of the Targum. "And what I did," seems
   to be the most natural addition: such words as vmh syty appear to have
   been left out by transcribers. I would then render the verse thus: --
   My people, remember, I pray,
   What did Balak, the king of Moab, consult,
   And what did Balaam, the son of Beor, answer him,
   (And what I did) from Shittim even to Gilgal,
   That ye may know the faithful dealings of Jehovah. -- Ed.

   [165] "His justice in destroying the Canaanites, his goodness in giving
   rest to his people Israel, and his faithfulness to his promises made
   unto the Fathers." -- Henry.

   Micah 6:6-8

   6. Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow myself before the
   high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of
   a year old?

   6. In quo occurram Jehovae? Incurvabo me coram Deo excelso? Occurramne
   ei in holocaustis? In vitulis anniculis?

   7. Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten
   thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my
   transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?

   7. An complacitum erit Jehovae in millibus arietum? In decem millibus
   vallium olei (vel, pinguedinis?) An dabo primogenitum peccatum meum
   (hoc est, piaculum peccati mei? Fructum ventris mei, piaculum sceleris
   animae mea?

   8. He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord
   require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk
   humbly with thy God?

   8. Indicavit tibi, homo, quid bonum; et quid Jehova quaerit abs te nisi
   facere judicium et deligere clementiam (vel, bonitatem,) et humiliari
   ut ambules cum Deo tuo.


   The Prophet now inquires, as in the name of the people, what was
   necessary to be done: and he takes these two principles as granted, --
   that the people were without any excuse, and were forced to confess
   their sin, -- and that God had hitherto contended with them for no
   other end and with no other design, but to restore the people to the
   right way; for if his purpose had only been to condemn the people for
   their wickedness, there would have been no need of these questions. But
   the Prophet shows what has been often stated before, -- that whenever
   God chides his people, he opens to them the door of hope as to their
   salvation, provided those who have sinned repent. As this then must
   have been well known to all the Jews, the Prophet here asks, as with
   their mouth, what was to be done.

   He thus introduces them as inquiring, With what shall I approach
   Jehovah, and bow down before the high God? [166]

   Shall I approach him with burnt-offerings, [167] with calves of a year
   old? But at the same time there is no doubt, but that he indirectly
   refers to that foolish notion, by which men for the most part deceive
   themselves; for when they are proved guilty, they indeed know that
   there is no remedy for them, except they reconcile themselves to God:
   but yet they pretend by circuitous courses to approach God, while they
   desire to be ever far away from him. This dissimulation has always
   prevailed in the world, and it now prevails: they see that they whom
   God convicts and their own conscience condemns, cannot rest in safety.
   Hence they wish to discharge their duty towards God as a matter of
   necessity; but at the same time they seek some fictitious modes of
   reconciliation, as though it were enough to flatter God, as though he
   could be pacified like a child with some frivolous trifles. The Prophet
   therefore detects this wickedness, which had ever been too prevalent
   among them; as though he said, -- "I see what ye are about to say; for
   there is no need of contending longer; as ye have nothing to object to
   God, and he has things innumerable to allege against you: ye are then
   more than condemned; but yet ye will perhaps say what has been usually
   alleged by you and always by hypocrites, even this, -- We wish to be
   reconciled to God, and we confess our faults and seek pardon; let God
   in the meantime show himself ready to be reconciled to us, while we
   offer to him sacrifices.'" There is then no doubt, but that the Prophet
   derided this folly, which has ever prevailed in the hearts of men: they
   ever think that God can be pacified by outward rites and frivolous
   performances.

   He afterwards adds, He has proclaimed to thee what is good. The Prophet
   reproves the hypocrisy by which the Jews willfully deceived themselves,
   as though he said, -- "Ye indeed pretend some concern for religion when
   ye approach God in prayer; but this your religion is nothing; it is
   nothing else than shamelessly to dissemble; for ye sin not either
   through ignorance or misconception, but ye treat God with mockery." --
   How so? "Because the Law teaches you with sufficient clearness what God
   requires from you; does it not plainly enough show you what is true
   reconciliation? But ye close your eyes to the teaching of the Law, and
   in the meantime pretend ignorance. This is extremely childish. God has
   already proclaimed what is good, even to do judgment, to love kindness
   and to walk humbly with God." We now perceive the design of the
   Prophet.

   As then he says here, With what shall I appear before God? we must bear
   in mind, that as soon as God condescends to enter into trial with men,
   the cause is decided; for it is no doubtful contention. When men
   litigate one with another, there is no cause so good but what an
   opposite party can darken by sophistries. But the Prophet intimates
   that men lose all their labor by evasions, when God summons them to a
   trial. This is one thing. He also shows what deep roots hypocrisy has
   in the hearts of all, for they ever deceive themselves and try to
   deceive God. How comes it that men, proved guilty, do not immediately
   and in the right way retake themselves to God, but that they ever seek
   windings? How is this? It is not because they have any doubt about what
   is right except they willfully deceive themselves, but because they
   dissemble and willfully seek the subterfuges of error. It hence appears
   that men perversely go astray when ever they repent not as they ought,
   and bring not to God a real integrity of heart. And hence it also
   appears that the whole world which continues in its superstitions is
   without excuse. For if we scrutinize the intentions of men, it will at
   length come to this, -- that men carefully and anxiously seek various
   superstitions, because they are unwilling to come before God and to
   devote themselves to him, without some dissembling and hypocrisy. Since
   it is so, certain it is, that all who desire to pacify God with their
   own ceremonies and other trifles cannot by any pretext escape. What is
   said here is at the same time strictly addressed to the Jews, who had
   been instructed in the teaching of the Law: and such are the Papists of
   this day; though they spread forth specious pretenses to excuse their
   ignorance, they may yet be refuted by this one fact, -- that God has
   prescribed clearly and distinctly enough what he requires: but they
   wish to be ignorant of this; hence their error is at all times wilful.
   We ought especially to notice this in the words of the Prophet; but I
   cannot proceed farther now.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast made known to us thy Law, and
   hast also added thy Gospel, in which thou callest us to thy service,
   and also invites us with all kindness to partake of thy grace, -- O
   grant, that we may not be deaf, either to thy command or to the
   promises of thy mercy, but render ourselves in both instances
   submissive to thee and so learn to devote all our faculties to thee,
   that we may in truth avow that a rule of a holy and religious life has
   been delivered to us in thy law, and that we may also firmly adhere to
   thy promises, lest through any of the allurements of the world, or
   through the flatteries and crafts of Satan thou shouldest suffer our
   minds to be drawn away from that love which thou hast once manifested
   to us in thine only-begotten Son and in which thou daily confirmest us
   by the teaching of the Gospel, until we at length shall come to the
   full enjoyment of this love in that celestial inheritance, which has
   been purchased for us by the blood of thy only Son. Amen.

   Lecture Ninety-fourth

   We have seen in the last lecture that hypocrites inquire how God is to
   be pacified, as though they were very solicitous about the performance
   of their duty; and that in the meantime these are mere disguises; for
   by circuitous windings they turn here and there, and never wish to come
   directly to God. The way might have been easily known by them; but they
   closed their eyes, and at the same time pretended that they had some
   concern for religion. And this is also very commonly the case in our
   day; and common experience, if any one opens his eyes, clearly proves
   this, -- that the ungodly, who deal not sincerely with God, profess a
   very great concern, as though they were wholly intent on serving God,
   and yet turn aside here and there, and seek many bypaths,
   (diverticula,) that they may not be constrained to present themselves
   before God. We have already seen, that this false pretense is fully
   exposed, inasmuch as God has enough, and more than enough, demonstrated
   in his Law, what he approves and what he requires from men. Why then do
   hypocrites, as still uncertain, make the inquiry? It is because they
   are willfully blind at mid-day; for the doctrine of the Law ought to
   have been to them as a lamp to direct their steps; but they smother
   this light, yea, they do what they can wholly to extinguish it: they
   ask, as though perplexed, how can we pacify God?

   But it ought also to be observed, (for the Prophet says, Shall I give
   my first-born, and the fruit of my loins, as an expiation for my soul?
   [168] ) that hypocrites will withhold nothing, provided they are not to
   devote themselves to God. We see the same thing under the Papacy at
   this day; they spare no expense, nor even the greatest toils: provided
   the ungodly have always a freedom to live in sin, they will easily
   grant to God all other things. For through a false conceit they make a
   sort of agreement with God: if they mortify themselves, and toil in
   ceremonies, and if they pour forth some portion of their money, if they
   sometimes deprive nature of its support, if with fastings and by other
   things, they afflict themselves, they think that by these means they
   have fully performed their duties. But these are frivolous trifles; for
   in the meantime they consider themselves exempt from the duty of
   obeying God. Being yet unwilling to be regarded as alienated from God,
   they, at the same time, obtrude on him their meritorious works, to
   prevent his judgment, and to exempt themselves from the necessity of
   doing the principal thing, that which he especially requires -- to
   bring a sincere heart. Thus then hypocrites wish to divide things with
   God, that they may remain within such as they are; and they spread
   forth outwardly many frivolous things for the purpose of pacifying him.
   And this is the reason why the Prophet says now, Shall I give my
   first-born? for hypocrites wish to appear as though they were burning
   with the greatest zeal, -- "Rather than that God should remain angry
   with me, I would not spare the life of my first-born; I would rather be
   the executioner of my own son: in short, nothing is so valuable to me,
   which I would not be really to part with, that God may be propitious to
   me." This indeed is what they boast with their mouth; but at the same
   time they will not offer their heart as a sacrifice to God: and as they
   deal dishonestly with God, we see that all is nothing but
   dissimulation.

   If any one objects, and says, -- that the other rites, of which the
   Prophet speaks here, had been enjoined by God's Law, the answer is
   easy; but I shall not now but briefly touch on what I have elsewhere
   more largely handled: The Prophet denies, that sacrifices avail any
   thing for the purpose of propitiating God. This may seem inconsistent
   with the teaching of the Law, but in fact it altogether agrees with it.
   God indeed wished sacrifices to be offered to him; and then this
   promise was always added, Iniquity shall be atoned. But the object must
   be noticed; for God did not command sacrifices, as though they were of
   themselves of any worth; but he intended to lead the ancient people by
   such exercises to repentance and faith. It was therefore his design to
   remind the Jews that they did no good, except they themselves became
   sacrifices; and it was also his will that they should look to the only
   true sacrifice, by which all sins are expiated. But hypocrites, like
   falsifiers of documents, abused the command of God, and adulterated the
   sacrifices themselves. It was then a profane sacrilege for them to
   think that God would be propitious to them, if they offered many oxen
   and calves and lambs. It was the same thing as if one asked the way,
   and after having known it, rested quietly and never moved a foot. God
   had shown the way, by which the Jews might come to repentance and
   faith: and they ought to have walked in it; but they wickedly trifled
   with God; for they thought that it would be a satisfaction to his
   justice, if they only performed outward rites. Whenever then the
   Prophets in God's name repudiate sacrifices, the abuse, by which God's
   Law was corrupted, is ever to be considered, that is, when the Jews
   brought sacrifices, only, and had no respect to the end in view, and
   did not exercise themselves in repentance and faith. It is for this
   reason that our Prophet declares, that all sacrifices were of no
   account before God, but were vain things: they were so, when they were
   separated from their right end.

   He then says that God had shown by his Law what is good; and then he
   adds what it is, to do justice, to love mercy, or kindness, and to be
   humbled before God. It is evident that, in the two first particulars,
   he refers to the second table of the Law; that is to do justice, and to
   love mercy [169] Nor is it a matter of wonder that the Prophet begins
   with the duties of love; for though in order the worship of God
   precedes these duties, and ought rightly to be so regarded, yet
   justice, which is to be exercised towards men, is the real evidence of
   true religion. The Prophet, therefore, mentions justice and mercy, not
   that God casts aside that which is principal -- the worship of his
   name; but he shows, by evidences or effects, what true religion is.
   Hypocrites place all holiness in external rites; but God requires what
   is very different; for his worship is spiritual. But as hypocrites can
   make a show of great zeal and of great solicitude in the outward
   worship of God, the Prophets try the conduct of men in another way, by
   inquiring whether they act justly and kindly towards one another,
   whether they are free from all fraud and violence, whether they observe
   justice and show mercy. This is the way our Prophet now follows, when
   he says, that God's Law prescribes what is good, and that is, to do
   justice -- to observe what is equitable towards men, and also to
   perform the duties of mercy.

   He afterwards adds what in order is first, and that is, to humble
   thyself to walk with God: [170] it is thus literally, "And to be humble
   in walking with thy God." No doubt, as the name of God is more
   excellent than any thing in the whole world, so the worship of him
   ought to be regarded as of more importance than all those duties by
   which we prove our love towards men. But the Prophet, as I have already
   said, was not so particular in observing order; his main object was to
   show how men were to prove that they seriously feared God and kept his
   Law: he afterwards speaks of God's worship. But his manner of speaking,
   when he says, that men ought to be humble, that they may walk with
   their God, is worthy of special notice. Condemned, then, is here all
   pride, and also all the confidence of the flesh: for whosoever
   arrogates to himself even the least thing, does, in a manner, contend
   with God as with an opposing party. The true way then of walking with
   God is, when we thoroughly humble ourselves, yea, when we bring
   ourselves down to nothing; for it is the very beginning of worshipping
   and glorifying God when men entertain humble and low opinion of
   themselves. Let us now proceed --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [168] The substance of the two lines is given here, not in their
   literal version. He evidently gives somewhat a different meaning from
   our translation; and probably the original admits better of the
   construction adopted here. If phs, a transgression or trespass, be
   taken for a trespass-offering, and cht'h, for a sin-offering, as it is
   often, then the rendering would be this, -- Shall I make my first-born
   my trespass-offering,
   The fruit of my loins a sin-offering for my soul? The verb ntn is not
   only to give, to present, to offer, but also to make, to constitute, to
   appoint. But if the first be rendered transgression, the law of
   parallelism requires that the second should be rendered sin. -- Ed.

   [169] The expression is remarkable -- to love mercy, or benevolence,
   beneficence, or kindness; it is not only to show mercy or kindness, but
   to love it, so as to take pleasure and delight in it. -- Ed.

   [170] The words are, vhtsn lkt m-'lhyk. The verb tsn occurs nowhere
   else but as a passive participle in Proverbs 11:2; but its meaning
   there is evident, for it is opposed to pride, zdvn, which means a
   swelling pride, such as fills one with high notions of one's self. Then
   the opposite of this is to be humble from a sense of one's own
   emptiness. As it is here to the infinitive Hiphil, its literal meaning
   is what Calvin assigns to it -- tohumble one's self. And the best
   rendering of this line would be -- "And to humble thyself to walk with
   God." The Septuagint renders it etoimon enai -- to be ready;
   Theodotion, asphalizou; Vulgate, solicitum But these seem not to have
   understood the word. The Welsh version is exactly and literally the
   Hebrew -- Ac ymostwng I rodio gyda th Dduw. Gostwng is to humble, and
   by adding ym, and dropping the g, the verb has exactly the meaning of
   the Hiphil in Hebrew--to humble one's self. They are, indeed, some
   verbs in Welsh which admit of all the modifications of the Hebrew
   verbs, being active, passive, causative, and reflective. -- Ed.

   Micah 6:9

   9. The Lord's voice crieth unto the city, and the man of wisdom shall
   see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.

   9. Vox Jehovae ad civitatem (vel, ad expergefaciendum) clamat (ad
   verbum, clamabit;) et vir intelligentiae videbit nomen tuum: audite
   virgam, et quis testificetur eam.


   The Prophet complains here that he and other teachers did but little,
   though their cry resounded and was heard by the whole people. He
   therefore says, that the voice of God cried; as though he had said that
   there was no excuse for ignorance, for God had indiscriminately
   exhorted them all to repentance. Now, since what was taught was common
   to them all, the Prophet deplores their perverseness, for very few were
   attentive; and the fable was sung, according to the proverb, to the
   deaf. We must then notice the word cry; the voice of God, he says,
   crieth. God did not whisper in the ear of one or two, but he designed
   his voice to be heard by all from the least to the greatest. The
   Prophets then did cry loud enough, but there were no ears to hear them.

   We may take the word lyr, laoir, in two ways. yr, oir, means a city.
   But some derive it from vr, our, and render it as if it were written
   lhyr, laeoir. If h, he is put in, it must be rendered, To rouse; and
   the letter h, he, may be concealed under the point chamets; and this
   sense would be the most suitable, The voice of Jehovah cries to arouse
   or awaken; that is though the people are torpid, and as it were
   overpowered with sleep, for they indulged themselves in their sins; yet
   the voice of God ought to be sufficient to arouse them all: however
   sleepy they might have been, there was yet power enough in the doctrine
   of the Law, which the Prophet daily proclaimed. But still this voice,
   by which the whole people ought to have been awakened, was not heard!

   The man of understanding, he says will see thy name The word tvsyh,
   tushie, means properly understanding, as it is clear from many other
   passages; but the Prophet means that there was a very small number who
   were teachable; and he calls them men of understanding. At the same
   time, he indirectly reproves the sottishness of the people, though they
   all boasted that they were wise, and boasted also that they were the
   learners of the Law. The Prophet shows here by implication, that
   understanding was a rare thing among that people; for few hearkened to
   the voice of God. And thus we see what his object was; for he wished to
   touch the Jews to the quick, that they might acknowledge that they were
   without mind and understanding, because they had hardened themselves
   against God, so that his voice did not reach their hearts. He therefore
   shows that they were all besides themselves; for had they any right
   understanding, they would have hearkened to God speaking to them, as
   they were his disciples. What indeed could have been more strange, nay
   more inhuman, than for men to reject the doctrine of their salvation,
   and to turn aside from hearing even God himself? Thus the madness of
   the people was reproved; for though the voice of God sounded in the
   ears of them all, it was not yet listened to.

   If one prefers reading, In the city, then no doubt the Prophet means,
   that the voice of God was proclaimed through all the cities: for to
   confine it, as some interpreters do, to Jerusalem, or to Samaria,
   appears frigid. We must then understand a change of number, and take
   city for any large concourse of people; as though he had said, that
   there was no city in which God did not cry and yet that there were ears
   no where.

   It afterwards follows, Shall see thy name. Some render it, Shall fear,
   [171] as though it was from yr', ira; but it comes on the contrary from
   r'h, rae; and rules of grammar will not allow it to be viewed
   otherwise. And the Prophet speaks in a striking manner, when he says,
   that the intelligent man seeth the name of God. For whence proceeded
   the contempt of wicked men, so that they disregarded the voice of God,
   except from this -- that his majesty had no effect on them; that is,
   they did not acknowledge that they had to do with God? For if they
   really understood what I have said, -- that God spoke to them, his
   majesty would have immediately come to view, it would have arrested all
   their thoughts. God then would have constrained even the most heedless
   to fear him, had it not been, that they imagined the voice which
   sounded in their ears was that of man. Significantly then does the
   Prophet say, that it was the act of singular prudence to see the name
   of God, that is to understand from whom the doctrine proceeded. For as
   soon as we hearken to God, his majesty, as I have said, must so
   penetrate all our thoughts, as to humble us before him, and to
   constrain us to do him homage. The contempt then of spiritual doctrine,
   and also the perverseness of ungodly men, proceed from this, -- that
   they see not the name of God, that they understand not that it is his
   name.

   He afterwards adds, Hear ye the rod, and him who proclaims it to you By
   rod he means threatening; as though he said, -- "Your arrogance in
   mocking God shall not go unpunished, as though his voice were an empty
   sound: there is then no reason for you to deceive yourselves with the
   hope of impunity; for God will avenge the contempt of his word." Now
   the Prophet's design was, to denounce an approaching vengeance on those
   who came not willingly to God, and received not his word with genuine
   docility of mind. Whenever, then, men despise the voice of God, as
   though it proceeded only from a mortal being, on such Micah denounces
   an impending vengeance; for the contempt of his word is a thing
   intolerable to God. This is the reason why he immediately adds, after
   having complained of the contempt of his word, that vengeance was not
   afar off; Hear ye then the rod, and who declares or testifies
   concerning it

   This last clause ought to be especially noticed; for the ungodly are
   not terrified when God declares that he will be an avenger, because
   they think not that they must give an account of their life, or they
   look only on mortal man, "Ah! who speaks? Is he indeed our God? Is he
   armed with celestial power? Do we not see a mortal man and one like
   ourselves?" We daily see that the ungodly do thus cast away every fear,
   and willfully harden themselves against God's judgments. It is not then
   without reason that the Prophet bids the Jews seriously to consider who
   testifies of the rod; as though he said, -- "I indeed confess that I am
   a mortal man, but remember who has sent me; for I go not forth as a
   private individual, nor have I presumptuously intruded into this
   office; but I am armed with God's command; nay, God himself speaks
   through my mouth. If then ye despise me, the Lord is present, who will
   vindicate his own commands for he will not suffer himself to be
   despised in his servants though they may be contemptible according to
   the flesh, he will yet have the reverence which it deserves to be paid
   to his word." We now perceive the real meaning of the Prophet. It now
   follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [171] And so Newcome renders it, and there are a few copies in favor of
   this reading, in which yr'y is found: but a fact of this kind is not
   sufficient to make a change, except there will be other reasons. And
   then in the next line there is a change made, without the authority of
   one MS. Indeed these two lines are rendered as though the Archbishop
   had another text; and indeed it is another: his version is this, -- And
   there is a sound wisdom with them that fear his name:
   Hear, O ye tribes, him that testifieth. This version is partly derived
   from the Septuagint; which could not have been wholly followed, as it
   differs so widely from the Hebrew, and hardly presents any meaning.
   There is far more correspondence in the passage, as it is rendered in
   our version, and by Calvin, and also by Henderson; and the Hebrew is
   closely followed. Drusius and others agree with Calvin, that tvsyh,
   which is rendered often "sound wisdom," is to be taken here as
   concrete, signifying a wise man. mth is evidently the rod of
   correction, and is used in this sense in Isaiah 10:5, 24; and it is
   more consistent with the whole passage to consider ydh as a future,
   construed, as in the present tense, with an affix, from d, to testify,
   than from yd to appoint, -- "Hear ye the rod," the chastening rod, "and
   who testifies of it." Newcome viewed it as being this verb; but he
   takes no notice of its affix h, which refers to the rod, by which
   chastisement is signified. -- Ed.

   Micah 6:10-11

   10. Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the
   wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable?

   10. Adhuc an sunt in domo impii thesauri impietatis? Et modius
   macilentus deterestabilis (vel, provocans iram?)

   11. Shall I count them pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag
   of deceitful weights?

   11. An justificabo stateras impietatis, et sacculum ponderum doli?


   Interpreters differ as to the word h's, eash: some think that it ought
   to be read h'ys, eaish, with an addition of two letters, and render it,
   "Is it yet man?" But this would render the passage abrupt. Others
   translate, "Is there yet fire?" As though it was 's, ash; and they
   suppose that wealth, wickedly and unjustly got, is so called, because
   it consumes itself. But as this is against what grammar requires, I am
   more inclined to take their view, who think that h's, eash, is to be
   taken here for hys, eish, [172] , aleph being put for jod: and they
   rightly consider that the sentence is to be read as a question, Are
   there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the ungodly? If
   this view be approved, then we must consider the Prophet as proposing a
   question respecting a thing really monstrous, -- How can it be that
   treasures, gathered by plunder and wickedness, still remain with you,
   since ye have been so often warned, and since God daily urges you to
   repentance? How great is your hardness, that no fear of God lays hold
   on your minds? But the meaning would not be unsuitable were we to
   regard God as a Judge examining them concerning a matter unknown, Are
   there still the treasures of impiety in the house of the ungodly? that
   is, "I will see whether the ungodly and wicked hide their treasures:"
   for God often assumes the character of earthly judges; not that any
   thing escapes his knowledge, but that we may know that he is not
   precipitant in deciding a question. This view, then, is by no means
   inappropriate, that is, that God here assumes the character of an
   earthly judge, and thus speaks, "I will see whether there are still
   treasures concealed by the ungodly; I will search their houses; I will
   know whether they have as yet repented of their crimes." thus, then,
   may be understood the words of the Prophet, Are there yet the treasures
   of wickedness in the house of the ungodly? For God, as I have already
   said, shows that he would know respecting the plunders and the various
   kinds of cruelty which they had exercised.

   He then adds, Is there the bare measure, that is, a measure less than
   it ought to be, which is detestable? [173] Then he says,

   Shall I justify? etc. [174] This verse is connected with the last, and
   is added as an explanation. For God having come forth as a Judge, now
   shows what sort of Judge he is, even one who is not biased by favor,
   who does not change his judgment, who shows no respect of persons. But
   men, for the most part, greatly deceive themselves, when they transform
   God according to their own will, and promise to themselves that he will
   be propitious to them, provided they only make false pretensions to
   him. God then here declares, that he differs widely from earthly
   judges, who now incline to one side and then to another, who are
   changeable, and often deviate from the right course: but, on the
   contrary, he says here, Shall I justify wicked balances? shall I
   justify weights of fraud, or deceitful? that is, "Shake off all those
   delusions by which ye are wont to deceive yourselves; for I do not
   change either my nature or my purpose; but according to the true
   teaching of my Law, I will punish all the wicked without any respect of
   persons: wherever wickedness and iniquity are found, there punishment
   will be inflicted."

   We now then understand how these two verses harmonize together. God
   shows that he will be a judge, and then, that he differs from men, who
   often change, as it has been said, in their decisions.

   I will mention another meaning, which will perhaps be preferred by
   some. The question, after the manner of the Hebrews, may be taken as an
   affirmation, as though he had said, that within a short time, (for vd,
   oud, means sometimes a short time,) the treasures of iniquity would not
   be found, for they would be taken away: then follows a confirmation,
   for frauds and robberies by false measures and deceitful weights could
   not escape God's judgment. The meaning then would be, that as God must
   necessarily, according to his own office, punish thefts, it cannot be
   that he will suffer men, who cheat by false weights to continue always
   unpunished. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [172] One MS. Has hys, which no doubt is the true reading. The
   Septuagint has mepur, which seems to have no sense whatever. Many
   copies have h'ys, and this is the reading followed by Junius and
   Tremelius, and their version is this, -- Has any one still the house of
   a dishonest man?
   The treasures of dishonesty?
   And the small detestable ephah? -- Ed.

   [173] Literally it is, "And the ephah of detestable scantiness?"
   Marckius renders the words, "Et ephah tenuitatis abominabilis?"
   Henderson, "And the accursed scanty ephah?"

   [174] h'zkh. It is not true what Henderson says, that the verb zkh is
   not used transitively. See Psalm 73:13; Proverbs 20:9 Jerome renders
   the phrase, numquid approbabo? Our own version is no doubt correct. --
   Ed.

   Micah 6:12

   12. For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants
   thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.

   12. Quia (sic enim verto; nam qui putant esse relationum, frigide
   exponunt, cujus divites ejus impleverunt rapinis; potius est, quia
   [175] nam 'sr saepe loco causalis particulae accipitur, quia ergo)
   divites ejus impleverunt (vel seipsos, vel domos suas, subaudiendum
   est) chms, rapina (vel, violentia;) et incolae ejus locuti sunt
   fallaciam, et lingua eorum fallax (vel, fraudulenta) in ore ipsorum.


   The Prophet means that the people were so given to avarice and plunder,
   that all the riches they had heaped together had been got by iniquitous
   robberies or by wicked gain. He now addresses the citizens of
   Jerusalem: for though iniquity then prevailed through the whole of
   Judea, there was yet a reason why he should distinctly accuse the
   inhabitants of Jerusalem; for they must have led the way by their
   example, and they were also worse in wickedness than the rest of the
   people: they were at least more obstinate, as they daily heard God's
   Prophets.

   Hence he says, her rich men gather not their wealth except by violence.
   It is indeed certain, that the rich were not then alone guilty before
   God; but this evil has too much prevailed, that the more liberty any
   one possesses, the more he employs it to do wrong. Those indeed who
   have not the power refrain, not because they are not inclined to do
   harm, but because they are as it were restrained; for poverty is often
   a bridle to men. As then the rich could spread their snares, as they
   had power to oppress the poor, the Prophet addresses his words to them,
   not that the rest were without fault or guilt, but because iniquity was
   more conspicuous in the rich, and that, because their wealthy as I have
   already said, gave them more power.

   He afterwards extends his address to all the inhabitants, They all, he
   says, speak falsehood, that is, they have no sincerity, no uprightness;
   they are wholly given to frauds and deceits. And their tongue is false
   in their mouth This mode of speaking seems apparently absurd; for where
   can the tongue be except in the mouth? It appears then a sort of
   redundancy, when he says that their tongue was deceitful in their
   mouth. But it is an emphatical mode of speaking, by which the Hebrews
   mean, that men have falsehoods in readiness as soon as they open their
   mouth. It is then the same as though the Prophet had said, that no pure
   word and free from guile could come from them, for as soon as they
   opened their mouth, falsehoods instantly came forth; their tongue was
   fraudulent, so that none could expect from these men any truth or
   faithfulness. -- How so? Because as soon as they began to speak, they
   instantly discovered some guile, there was ever in readiness some
   falsehood to circumvent the simple.

   We now then see that not a few men were summoned before God's tribunal,
   but that all without exception were condemned; as though the Prophet
   had said, that there was no more any integrity in the city, and that
   corruptions prevailed everywhere, for all were intent on deceiving one
   another. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [175] There is nothing in what goes before for which a reason is given
   here: hence this 'sr cannot be rendered as here proposed. It is an
   instance of a peculiarity in Hebrew, when a double pronoun is used.
   Literally it is, "Which the rich men of hers;" the reference is to the
   city mentioned in verse 9. Grotius, Newcome, and Henderson, render the
   words thus, "Whose rich men," etc. The Welsh is very nearly the same,
   which no more than the Hebrew can with propriety be literally rendered
   in English or in the learned languages, -- Yr hon y mae ei
   chyvoethogion yn llawn trais -- The which her rich men are full of
   violence. But this mode of speaking has a more distinct and fuller
   reference to what is gone before than the simple relative "whose:" the
   connection is made more evident. -- Ed.

   Micah 6:13-14

   13. Therefore also will I make thee sick in smiting thee, in making
   thee desolate because of thy sins.

   13. Et ego etiam affligam te percutiendo, et te disperdam super
   peccatis tuis (secundum tua scelera.)

   14. Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down shall be
   in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver;
   and that which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword.

   14. Tu comedes, et non satiaberis; et dejectio tua in medio tui; et
   apprehendes, et non servabis; et quod servaveris gladio tradam.


   God, after having declared that he would be the Judge of the people,
   speaks now more clearly of their punishment. He says therefore that he
   was armed with vengeance: for it often happens, when a judge, even one
   who hates wickedness, is not able to punish, for he dreads the
   fierceness of those whom he thinks himself unequal to restrain. Hence
   God intimates here, that there will not be wanting to him a power to
   punish the people, I will afflict thee, he says, by striking or
   wounding thee; for so some render the words. [176] The sum of what is
   said is, -- that nothing would be an obstacle to prevent God from
   inflicting punishment on the people, for there would be no want of
   power in his case. There is therefore no reason for men to promise
   themselves any escape when God ascends his tribunal; for were they
   fortified by all possible means they could not ward off the hand of
   God.

   And he points out what sort of punishment it would be; and he mentions
   even two kinds in this verse. He says first, Thou shalt eat, and shalt
   not be satisfied. One of God's plagues, we know, is famine: and so the
   Prophet here declares, that the people would be famished, but not
   through the sterility of the fields. God indeed brings a famine in two
   ways: now the land yields no fruit; the corn withers, or, being smitten
   with hail, gives no fruit; and thus God by the sterility of the fields
   often reduces men to want and famine: then another mode is adopted, by
   which he can consume men with want, namely, when he breaks the staff of
   bread, when he takes away from bread its nourishing virtues so that it
   can no more support men, whatever quantity they may swallow; and this
   is what experience proves, if only we have eyes to observe the
   judgments of God. We now see the meaning of this clause, when he says,
   Thou shalt eat, and shalt not be satisfied; as though he said, "I can
   indeed, whenever it pleases me, deprive you of all food; the earth
   itself will become barren at my command: but that ye may more clearly
   understand that your life is in my hand, a good supply of fruit shall
   be produced, but it shall not satisfy you. Ye shall then perceive that
   bread is not sufficient to support you; for by eating ye shall not be
   able to derive from bread any nourishment."

   He then adds, And thy dejection [177] shall be in the midst of thee;
   that is, though no man from without disturb or afflict thee yet thou
   shalt pine away with intestine evils. This is the real meaning; and
   interpreters have not sufficiently considered what the Prophet means,
   through too much negligence. But the passage ought to be noticed: for
   the Prophet, after having threatened a famine, not from want, but from
   the secret curse of God, now adds, Thy dejection shall be in the midst
   of thee; that is "Though I should rouse against thee no enemies, though
   evidences of my wrath should not appear, so as to be seen at a
   distance, yea, though no one should disturb thee, yet thy dejection,
   thy calamity, shall be in the midst of thee, as though it were cleaving
   to thy bowels; for thou shalt pine away through a hidden malady, when
   God shall pronounce his curse on thee."

   He now subjoins another kind of punishment, Thou shalt take hold, [178]
   but shalt not deliver, and what thou shalt deliver, I will give up to
   the sword Some read, "A woman shall lay hold," that is, conceive seed,
   "and shall not preserve it;" and then, "though she may bring forth in
   due time, I will yet give up what may be born to the sword." But this
   meaning is too strained. Others apply the words to fathers, "Thou,
   father, shalt lay hold;" that is thou shalt endeavor to preserve thy
   children, "and thou shalt not preserve them." But I wonder that
   interpreters have thus toiled in vain in a matter so simple and plain.
   For he addresses here the land, or he addresses the city: as though he
   said, "The city shall take hold," or embrace, as every one does who
   wishes to preserve or keep any thing; for what we wish to keep safe, we
   lay hold on it, and keep it as it were in our arms; "and what thou
   shalt preserve, I will give up to the sword: thou wilt try all means to
   preserve thyself and thy people, but thou shalt not succeed: thou shalt
   then lose all thy labor, for though thou shouldest preserve some, yet
   the preserved shall not escape destruction."

   If any one prefers to refer what is said to women, with regard to
   conception, as the third person of the feminine gender is used, let him
   have his own opinion; for this sense may certainly be admitted, that
   is, that the Lord would render the women barren, and that what they
   might bring forth would be given up to the slaughter, inasmuch as the
   Lord would at length destroy with the sword both the parents and their
   children.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [176] Newcome renders this line differently, -- Wherefore I will begin
   go smite thee. Following a few MSS. And the Septuagint, he takes the
   verb here to be hchlty, which means, to begin; but the rendering seems
   flat, and suits not the passage; and it is not true, for the Lord has
   often smitten them before. The verb is in the past tense, and this has
   created a difficulty. The verbs in the following verse, which is
   connected with this, are all in the future tense, referring to a coming
   judgment. To remove this difficulty I propose the following version, --
   But even I, who have made thee to grieve by striking thee,
   Will make thee wholly desolate on account of thy sins: Then the
   threatened desolation is specified. The verb hsmm, making desolate, is
   evidently a participle connected with 'ny I, at the beginning of the
   verse, the rest being an intervening clause: and when a participle
   follows a nominative case, which often occurs in Hebrew, the auxiliary
   verb must be supplied in a translation, which in its tense must be
   regulated by the context, and here by the verse which follows. Piscator
   renders it Desolabo, and says, that it is an infinitive put for the
   future. Grief or sorrow had already been produced, but now entire
   desolation is threatened. -- Ed.

   [177] Newcome, without the authority of a single MS., but following the
   Septuagint and Houbigant, has changed yschk into ychsk, "it shall be
   dark." Though the meaning of the passage is not thus materially
   affected, it is an alteration without sufficient reasons, there being
   no MS. in its favor, and no necessity arising from the passage itself:
   indeed, dejection or depression, or casting down, is more suitable to
   the context, and more emphatical. -- Ed.

   [178] The verb is tsn, which Henderson considers to be in Hephil, the y
   being left out, which is sometimes the case: with Drusius and others,
   he renders it, "remove," that is not goods, as he says, but wives and
   children; for if any were for a time removed to a place of safety, they
   were afterwards to be given up to the sword. Several copies have s
   instead of s, which makes it to be the verb nsg, and this has the
   meaning of laying hold or apprehending. But either meaning will suit
   the context. -- Ed.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou canst find in us cause enough to
   execute not only one kind of vengeance, but innumerable kinds of
   vengeance, so as to destroy us at length altogether, -- O grant, that
   we may of our own accord anticipate thy judgment, and with true
   humility so abhor ourselves, that there may be kindled in us a genuine
   desire to seek what is just and right, and thus endeavor to devote
   ourselves wholly to thee, that we may find thee to be propitious to us:
   and since we in so many ways offend thee, grant, that in true and
   sincere faith we may raise up all our thoughts and affections to thy
   only-begotten Son, who is our propitiation, that thou being appeased,
   we may lay hold on him, and remain united to him by a sacred bond,
   until thou at length gatherest us all into that celestial kingdom,
   which he has procured for us by his own blood. Amen.

   Micah 6:15

   15. Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the
   olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but
   shalt not drink wine.

   15. Tu seres, et non metes; tu calcabis (vel, premes) oleum, et non
   unges te oleo; et mustum, et non bibes vinum.


   The Prophet adds another kind of punishment, which was to follow the
   calamity threatened in the last verse. He had said, that those who
   escaped would at length be destroyed by the sword; he says now, that
   the whole land would become a prey to enemies: and he took his words
   from Moses; for it was usual with the prophets, when they wished to
   secure greater authority to themselves, to quote literally the curses
   contained in the Law, as in the present instance: see Deuteronomy 28
   and Leviticus 26. Now it is well known, that God denounced this
   punishment, with others, on the people, -- that when they sowed their
   fields, another would reap, -- that when they cultivated with great
   labor their vineyards, others would become the vintagers. The meaning
   is that whatever fruit the land produced, would come into the hands of
   enemies, for all things would be exposed to plunder. Now it is a very
   grievous thing, when we see not only our provisions consumed by
   enemies, but also the fruit of our labor; which is the same as though
   they were to drink our blood: for the labor of man is often compared to
   blood, for labor occasions perspiration. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Micah 6:16

   16. For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house
   of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a
   desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall
   bear the reproach of my people.

   16. Et observata sunt edicta Amri, et omne opus domus Ahab; et
   ambulabitis consiliis eorum, ut tradam te in excidium (vel,
   vastitatem,) et incolas ejus in sibilum; et opprobrium populi mei
   portabitis.


   Some read the words in the future tense, "And they will observe the
   statutes of Omri," etc., and gather this meaning, -- that the Prophet
   now foresees by the Spirit, that the people would continue so perverse
   in their sins, as to exclude every hope that they could be reformed by
   any punishments. The meaning then would be, "The Lord has indeed
   determined to punish sharply and severely the wickedness of this
   people; but they will not repent; they will nevertheless remain stupid
   in their obstinacy, and go on in their superstitions, which they have
   learned from the kings of Israel." There is however another view, and
   one more generally approved and that is, -- that the Jews, having
   forsaken God, and despised his Law, had turned aside to the
   superstitions of the kingdom of Israel. Hence he says, that observed
   were the decrees of Omri, and every work of the house of Ahab Omri was
   the father of Ahab, who was made king by the election of the soldiers,
   when Zimri, who had slain the king, was rejected. When Omri bought
   Samaria, he built there a city; and to secure honor to it, he added a
   temple; and hence idolatry increased. Afterwards his son Ahab abandoned
   himself to every kind of superstition. Thus matters became continually
   worse. Hence the Prophet, by mentioning here king Omri and his
   posterity, (included in the words, "the house of Ahab") clearly means,
   that the Jews who had purely worshipped God, at length degenerated, and
   were now wholly unlike Israelites, as they had embraced all those
   abominations which Omri and his son Ahab had devised. True religion as
   yet prevailed in the tribe of Judah, though the kingdom of Israel was
   become corrupt, and filthy superstitions had gained the ascendancy: but
   in course of time the Jews became also implicated in similar
   superstitions. Of this sin the Prophet now accuses them; that is, that
   they made themselves associates with the Israelites: Observed [179]
   then are the edicts of Omri, and the whole work of the house of Ahab:
   Ye walk, he says, (the future here means a continued act, as often
   elsewhere,) ye walk in their counsels.

   It must be observed, that the Prophet here uses respectable terms, when
   he says that hqt, chekut, statutes or decrees, were observed; and when
   he adds, "the counsels" of the kings of Israel: but yet this is in no
   way stated as an excuse for them; for though men may not only be
   pleased with, but also highly commend, their own devices, yet the Lord
   abominates them all. The Prophet no doubt designedly adopted these
   words, in order to show that those pretenses were frivolous and of no
   account, which superstitious men adduce, either to commend or to excuse
   their own inventions. They ever refer to public authority, -- "This has
   been received by the consent of all; that has been decreed; it is not
   the mistake of one or two men; but the whole Church has so determined:
   and kings also thus command; it would be a great sin not to show
   obedience to them." Hence the Prophet, in order to show how puerile are
   such excuses, says, "I indeed allow that your superstitions are by you
   honorably distinguished, for they are approved by the edicts of your
   kings, and are received by the consent of the many, and they seem not
   to have been inconsiderately and unadvisedly, but prudently contrived,
   even by great men, who were become skillful through long experience."
   But how much soever they might have boasted of their statutes and
   counsels, and however plausibly they might have referred to prudence
   and power in order to disguise their idolatries, yet all those things
   were of no account before God. By counsels, the Prophet no doubt meant
   that false kind of wisdom which always shines forth in the traditions
   of men; and by statutes, he meant the kingly authority.

   We hence see that it is a vain thing to color over what is idolatrous,
   by alleging power on the one hand in its favor, and wisdom on the
   other. -- How so? Because God will not allow dishonor to be done to him
   by such absurd things; but he commands us to worship him according to
   what is prescribed in his Word.

   And now a denunciation of punishment follows, That I should deliver
   thee to desolation, and its inhabitants, etc. There is a change of
   person; the Prophet continually addresses the land, and under that
   name, the people, -- that I should then deliver thee to exile, or
   desolation, and thine inhabitants to hissing It is a quotation from
   Moses: and by hissing he means the reproach and mockery to which men in
   a miserable state are exposed.

   At last he adds, Ye shall bear the reproach of my people Some take the
   word, people, in a good sense, as though the Prophet had said here,
   that God would punish the wrongs which the rich had done to the
   distressed common people; but this view, in my judgment, is too
   confined. Others understand this by the reproach of God's people, --
   that nothing would be more reproachful to the Jews, than that they had
   been the people of God; for it would redound to their dishonor and
   disgrace, that they, who had been honored by such an honorable name,
   were afterwards given up to so great miseries. But the passage may be
   otherwise explained: we may understand by the people of God the
   Israelites; as though the Prophet said, "Do ye not perceive how the
   Israelites have been treated? Were they not a part of my people? They
   were descendants from the race of Abraham as well as you; nor can you
   boast of a higher dignity: They were then equal to you in the opinion
   of all; and yet this privilege did not hinder my judgment, did not
   prevent me from visiting them as they deserved." Such a view harmonizes
   with the passage: but there is, as I think, something ironical in the
   expression, "my people;" as though he said, "The confidence, that ye
   have been hitherto my people, hardens you: but this false and wicked
   boasting shall increase your punishment; for I will not inflict on you
   an ordinary punishment, as on heathens and strangers; but I shall
   punish your wickedness much more severely; for it is necessary, that
   your punishment should bear proportion to my favor, which has been so
   shamefully and basely despised by you." Hence, by the reproach of God's
   people, I understand the heavier judgments, which were justly prepared
   for all the ungodly, whom God had favored with such special honor, as
   to regard them as his people: for the servant, who knew his master's
   will, and did it not, was on that account more severely corrected,
   [180] Luke 12:47. Let us now proceed --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [179] The verb, ystmr, is in the singular, and is followed by its
   nominative case, which is in the plural number. Grammarians are at a
   loss to account for this, and hence propose several modes of
   construction. But it is evidently an anomalous idiom, somewhat similar
   to that in Greek, when plural neuters take a verb in the singular
   number. As it has been already observed, such a construction as we find
   here, is very common in the Welsh language. The verb is in Hithpael,
   the reflective mood, the t, as often the case, changing place with the
   first letter of the verb. It is not always that this mood is
   reflective, but is sometimes passive, as we find to be the case with
   str, in Isaiah 29:14, and vr, in Deuteronomy 3:26. And so here it does
   not retain its reflective meaning. But it may be, that intensity,
   diligence, or earnestness, is intended to be conveyed; that is, that
   the statutes of Omri were diligently and carefully observed. -- Ed.

   [180] There is another view mentioned by Drusius, -- that is, the
   reproach which God had previously denounced on his people, in case they
   sinned and continued in their perverseness. Reproach in this sense
   would mean punishment. -- Ed.

   Micah 7:1-2

   1. Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as
   the grapegleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat: my soul
   desired the firstripe fruit.

   1. Vae mihi (alii deducunt a yll, ululare meum; sed est particula
   dolentis apud Hebraeos; Vae mihi ergo,) quia fui sicut collectiones
   aestatis (sic est ad verbum,) et sicuti racemi vindemiae; nullus botrus
   ad comedendum; maturos fructus (vel, primitias frugum) desideravit
   anima mea.

   2. The good man is perished out of the earth: and there is none upright
   among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his
   brother with a net.

   2. Periit humanus (vel, mansuetus) e terra, et rectus in hominibus nemo
   est; et omnes sanguinibus insidiantur, quisque fratrem suum venatur
   reti (alii, ad perniciem; et hrm, etiam Hebraeis interdum est occisio.)


   The meaning of the first verse is somewhat doubtful: some refer what
   the Prophet says to punishment; and others to the wickedness of the
   people. The first think that the calamity, with which the Lord had
   visited the sins of the people, is bewailed; as though the Prophet
   looked on the disordered state of the whole land. But it may be easily
   gathered from the second verse, that the Prophet speaks here of the
   wickedness of the people, rather than of the punishment already
   inflicted. I have therefore put the two verses together, that the full
   meaning may be more evident to us.

   Woe then to me! Why? I am become as gatherings Too free, or rather too
   licentious is this version, -- "I am become as one who seeks to gather
   summer-fruits, and finds none;" so that being disappointed of his hope,
   he burns with desire. This cannot possibly be considered as the
   rendering of the Prophet's words. There is indeed some difficulty in
   the expressions: their import, however, seems to be this, -- that the
   land, which the Prophet undertakes here to represent and personify, was
   like to a field, or a garden, or a vineyard, that was empty. He
   therefore says, that the land was stripped of all its fruit, as it is
   after harvest and the vintage. So by gatherings we must understand the
   collected fruit. Some understand the gleanings which remain, as when
   one leaves carelessly a few clusters on the vines: and thus, they say,
   a few just men remained alive on the land. But the former comparison
   harmonizes better with the rest of the passage, and that is, that the
   land was now stripped of all its fruit, as it is after the harvest and
   the vintage. I am become then as the gatherings of summer, that is, as
   in the summer, when the fruit has been already gathered; and as the
   clusters of the vintage, that is when the vintage is over. [181]

   There is no cluster, he says to eat. The Prophet refers here to the
   scarcity of good men; yea, he says that there were no longer any
   righteous men living. For though God had ever preserved some hidden
   seed, yet it might have been justly declared with regard to the whole
   people, that they were like a field after gathering the corn, or a
   vineyard after the vintage. Some residue, indeed, remains in the field
   after harvest, but there are no ears of corn; and in the vineyard some
   bunches remain, but they are empty; nothing remains but leaves. Now
   this personification is very forcible when the Prophet comes forth as
   though he represented the land itself; for he speaks in his own name
   and person, Woe is to me, he says, for I am like summer-gatherings! It
   was then the same thing, as though he deplored his own nakedness and
   want, inasmuch as there were not remaining any upright and righteous
   men.

   In the second verse he expresses more clearly his mind, Perished, he
   says, has the righteous [182] from the land, and there is none upright
   [183] among men. Here now he does not personify the land. It was indeed
   a forcible and an emphatic language, when he complained at the
   beginning, that he groaned as though the land was ashamed of its
   dearth: but the Prophet now performs the office of a teacher, Perished,
   he says, has the righteous from the land; there is no one upright among
   men; all lay in wait for blood; every one hunts his brother as with a
   net In this verse the Prophet briefly shows, that all were full both of
   cruelty and perfidy, that there was no care for justice; as though he
   said, In vain are good men sought among this people; for they are all
   bloody, they are all fraudulent. When he says, that they all did lay in
   wait for blood, he no doubt intended to set forth their cruelty, as
   though he had said, that they were thirsting for blood. But when he
   adds, that each did lay in wait for their brethren, he alludes to their
   frauds or to their perfidy.

   We now then perceive the meaning of the Prophet: and the manner he
   adopts is more emphatical than if God, in his own name, had pronounced
   the words: for, as men were fixed, and as though drowned, in their own
   carelessness, the Prophet introduces here the land as speaking, which
   accuses its own children, and confesses its own guilt; yea, it
   anticipates God's judgment, and acknowledges itself to be contaminated
   by its own inhabitants, so that nothing pure remained in it. It follows
   --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [181] Newcome renders the verse somewhat different, and makes the
   comparison more clear, -- "Woe is me! For I am become
   As the gatherers of late figs,
   As the gleaners of the vintage:
   There is no cluster to eat;
   My soul desireth the first ripe fig." Substantially the same is the
   version of Dathius and of Henderson. "Late figs" is not strictly the
   meaning of qyph, which is properly summer or summer-fruit; yet, as the
   early or first ripe fig is mentioned in the last line, which forms a
   contrast with this, what is meant, no doubt, is the late figs. Then the
   word for "gleaners," llt, is properly, gleanings; but here it is
   evidently to be taken as a concrete, gleaners, to correspond with
   gatherers, though Newcome considers the women-gleaners to be intended.
   The four last lines form a parallelism, in which the first and the
   early fig, -- the vintage and the cluster. -- Ed.

   [182] Justus, rendered in the text humanus, vel, mansuetus The Hebrew
   is chsyr, rendered by the Septuagint "eusbes--godly, pious,"--by
   Marckius, "benignus -- kind, benignant," -- by Newcome, "the good man,"
   -- and by Henderson, "the pious." It is sometimes rendered holy; but
   its meaning is, kind, benevolent, merciful, actively good, beneficent.
   In Psalm 12:1, it is rendered "godly," and in Isaiah 57:1, "merciful."
   -- Ed.

   [183] Rectus, ysr, rendered by the Septuagint, "katorthon--one going
   straight to an object,"--by Newcome and Henderson, "upright." It is one
   who proceeds in a straight course according to the rule of the law,
   without making any windings or turning aside into any devious path. --
   Ed.

   Micah 7:3

   3. That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh,
   and the judge asketh for a reward; and the great man, he uttereth his
   mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.

   3. Super malitia manuum suarum ad beneficiendum; princeps postulat, et
   judex in mercede (ego transfero ad verbum,) et magnus loquitur
   pravitatem animae suae ipse; et complicant (vel, ut alii vertunt,
   confirmant; sed proprie est complicari; et metaphora apte convenit
   contextui, ut statim videbimus.)


   This verse is properly addressed to the judges and governors of the
   people, and also to the rich, who oppressed the miserable common
   people, because they could not redeem themselves by rewards. The
   Prophet therefore complains, that corruptions so much prevailed in
   judgments, that the judges readily absolved the most wicked, provided
   they brought bribes. The sum of what is said then is, that any thing
   might be done with impunity, for the judges were venal. This is the
   Prophet's meaning.

   But as interpreters differ, something shall be said as to the import of
   the words. l hr kphym, ol ero caphim, For the evil of their hands to do
   good. Some give this explanation, "Though they are openly wicked, yet
   they make pretenses, by which they cover their wickedness:" and the
   sense would be this, -- that though they had cast aside every care for
   what was right, they yet had become so hardened in iniquity, that they
   wished to be deemed good and holy men; for in a disordered state of
   things the wicked always show an iron front, and would have silence to
   be observed respecting their shameful deeds. Some interpreters
   therefore think that the Prophet here complains, that there was now no
   difference between what was honorable and base, right and wrong; for
   wicked men dared so to disguise their iniquities, that they did not
   appear, or, that no one ventured to say any thing against them. Do you,
   however, examine and consider, whether what the Prophet says may be
   more fitly connected together in this way, That they may do good for
   the wickedness of their hands, that is, to excuse themselves for the
   wickedness of their hands, they agree together; for the prince asks,
   the judge is ready to receive a bribe. Thus, the rich saw that
   exemption might have been got by them, for they had the price of
   redemption in their hands: they indeed knew that the judges and princes
   could be pacified, when they brought the price of corruption. And this
   is the meaning which I approve, for it harmonizes best with the words
   of the Prophet. At the same time, some give a different explanation of
   the verb lhytyv, laeithib, that is that they acted vigorously in their
   wickedness: but this exposition is frigid. I therefore embrace the one
   I have just stated, which is, -- that corruptions so prevailed in the
   administration of justice, that coverings were ready for all crimes;
   for the governors and judges were lovers of money, and were always
   ready to absolve the most guilty, but not without a reward. For the
   wickedness then of their works, that they may do good, that is, that
   they may obtain acquittance, the prince only asks; he examines not the
   case, but only regards the hand; and the judge, he says, judges for
   reward: the judges also were mercenary. They did not sit to determine
   what was right and just; but as soon as they were satisfied by bribes,
   they easily forgave all crimes; and thus they turned vices into
   virtues; for they made no difference between white and black, but
   according to the bribe received. [184]

   This view is consistent with what the Prophet immediately subjoins, The
   great, he says, speaks of the wickedness of his soul, even he By the
   great, he does not mean the chief men, as some incorrectly think, but
   he means the rich, who had money enough to conciliate the judges. They
   then who could bring the price of redemption, dared to boast openly of
   their wickedness: for so I render the word hvt, eut, as it cannot be
   suitable to translate it here, corruption. Speak then of the wickedness
   of his soul does the great; there was then nothing, neither fear nor
   shame, to restrain the rich from doing wrong. -- How so? For they knew
   that they had to do with mercenary judges and could easily corrupt
   them. They hence dared to speak of the wickedness of their soul: they
   did not cloak their crimes, as it is the case when some fear of the Law
   prevails, when justice is exercised: but as no difference was made
   between good and evil, the most guilty boasted openly of his
   wickedness. And the pronoun hv', eva, he himself, is also emphatical;
   and this has not been observed by interpreters. He then himself speaks
   of the wickedness of his soul; he did not wait until others accuse him
   of doing wrong, but he shamelessly dared to glory in his crimes; for
   impunity was certain, as he could close the mouth of the judges by
   bringing a bribe. Speak then of the wickedness of his soul does he
   himself. [185]

   And further, they fold up wickedness; which means, that raging cruelty
   prevailed, because the governors, and those who wished to purchase
   liberty to sin, conspired together; as though they made ropes, and thus
   rendered firm their wickedness. For the great man, that is, the rich
   and the monied, agreed with the judge, and the judge with him; and so
   there was a collusion between them. It hence happened, that wickedness
   possessed, as it were, a tyrannical power; for there was no remedy. We
   now apprehend the real design of the Prophet, at least as far as I am
   able to discover. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [184] This clause, though the general sense is allowed by most to be
   the same, is yet variously rendered. Drusius says, "Locus hic diu me
   multumque torsit." The original is, -- el hre kpyM lhyjyb The most
   satisfactory rendering is that which is offered by Marckius, which is
   this, -- Propter malefaciendum volae pro benefaciendum, --
   For doing evil [are their] hands instead of doing good. Rabbi Jonathan,
   as quoted by Marckius, gives substantially the same rendering, though
   not literally, -- Malum faciunt manibus suis, et non bonum faciunt, --
   Evil they do with their hands, and they do no good. Our version is that
   of Junius and Tremelius, and is substantially followed by Newcome; and
   Henderson's version is, -- For evil their hands are well prepared;
   which is nearly that of the Septuagint,-- Epi to kakon tav ceirav autwn
   etoimazousi But the following would be as literal a translation as that
   of Marckius, -- For doing evil are their hands, to do it thoroughly.
   The last verb means not only to do good, but also to make a thing good
   or complete, fully to execute it. -- Ed.

   [185] The whole verse may be rendered thus,-- For doing evil are their
   hands, to execute it fully:
   The prince asks, and the judge also, for reward;
   When the great man speaks of oppression,
   That it is his desire, then they contrive it together,
   or, literally, entwine it. To render hvt nphsv hv', "the wickedness of
   the soul," as Newcome does, is to leave out wholly the last word; and
   Henderson does the same. Piscator gives the form of the words,
   "aerumnam, quam expetit -- the mischief, which he desires." The two
   last words literally are, "his desire it is." -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Micah 7:4

   4. The best of them is as a brier: the most upright is sharper than a
   thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation cometh; now
   shall be their perplexity.

   4. Bonus inter eos quasi paliurus, rectus prae spineto (aliquid
   subaudiendum est, asperior est spineto;) dies speculatorum tuorum,
   visitatio tua venit; tunc erit confusio ipsorum (vel, perplexitas, ut
   alii vertunt.)


   The Prophet confirms what he had previously said, -- that the land was
   so full of every kind of wickedness, that they who were deemed the best
   were yet thorns and briers, full of bitterness, or very sharp to prick;
   as though he said, "The best among them is a thief; the most upright
   among them is a robber." We hence see, that in these words he alludes
   to their accumulated sins, as though he said, "The condition of the
   people cannot be worse; for iniquity has advanced to its extreme point:
   when any one seeks for a good or an upright man, he only finds thorns
   and briers; that is, he is instantly pricked." But if the best were
   then like thorns, what must have been the remainder? We have already
   seen that the judges were so corrupt that they abandoned themselves
   without feeling any shame to any thing that was base. What then could
   have been said of them, when the Prophet compares here the upright and
   the just to thorns; yea, when he says, that they were rougher than
   briers? Though it is an improper language to say, that the good and the
   upright [186] among them were like briers; for words are used contrary
   to their meaning, as it is certain, that those who inhumanely pricked
   others were neither good nor just: yet the meaning of the Prophet is in
   no way obscure, -- that there was then such license taken in
   wickedness, that even those who retained in some measure the credit of
   being upright were yet nothing better than briers and thorns. There is
   then in the words what may be deemed a concession.

   He then adds, The day of thy watchmen, thy visitation comes He here
   denounces the near judgment of God, generally on the people, and
   especially on the rulers. But he begins with the first ranks and says
   The day of thy watchmen; as though he said, "Ruin now hangs over thy
   governors, though they by no means expect it." Watchmen he calls the
   Prophets, who, by their flatteries, deceived the people, as well as
   their rulers: and he sets the Prophets in the front, because they were
   the cause of the common ruin. He does not yet exempt the body of the
   people from punishment; nay, he joins together these two things, -- the
   visitation of the whole people, and the day of the watchmen.

   And justly does he direct his discourse to these watchmen, who, being
   blind, blinded all the rest; and who, being perverted, led astray the
   whole people. This is the reason why the Prophet now, in an especial
   manner, threatens them; but, as I have already said, the people were
   not on this account to be excused. There may seem indeed to have been
   here a fair pretense for extenuating their guilt: the common people
   might have said that they had not been warned as they ought to have
   been; nay, that they had been destroyed through delusive falsehoods.
   And we see at this day that many make such a pretense as this. But a
   defense of this kind is of no avail before God; for though the common
   people are blinded, yet they go astray off their own accord, since they
   lend a willing ear to impostors. And even the reason why God gave loose
   reins to Satan as well as to his ministers, and why he gives, as Paul
   says, (2 Thessalonians 2:11,) power to delusion, is this, -- because
   the greater part of the world ever seeks to be deceived. The
   denunciation of the Prophet then is this, -- that as the judges and the
   Prophets had badly exercised their office, they would be led to the
   punishment which they deserved, for they had been, as it has been
   elsewhere observed, the cause of ruin to others: in the meantime, the
   common people were not excusable. The vengeance of God then would
   overtake them and from the least to the greatest, without any
   exemption. Thy visitation then comes.

   He afterwards speaks in the third person, Then shall be their
   confusion, or perplexity, or they shall be ashamed. The Prophet here
   alludes indirectly to the hardness of the people; for though the
   Prophets daily threatened them, they yet remained all of them secure;
   nay, we know that all God's judgments were held in derision by them. As
   then the faithful teachers could not have moved wicked men either with
   fear or with shame, the Prophet says, Then confusion shall come to
   them; as though he said, "Be hardened now as much as ye wish to be, as
   I see that you are stupid, yea, senseless, and attend not to the word
   of the Lord; but the time of visitation will come, and then the Lord
   will constrain you to be ashamed, for he will really show you to be
   such as ye are; and he will not then contend with you in words as he
   does now; but the announced punishment will divest you of all your
   false pretenses; and he will also remove that waywardness which now
   hardens you against wholesome doctrine and all admonitions."
     __________________________________________________________________

   [186] It is better, as it is done here, to take the words simply as
   they are, and not to make superlatives of them: nor is there any change
   necessary in the second line as proposed by Dathius, Newcome, and
   others, by taking the m from one word and attaching it to another.
   There is no MS. In its favor, and it is done only on the authority of
   the Targum. The two lines are these, -- Their good man is like a brier,
   The upright worse than a thorny hedge. The preposition m is often
   rendered "rather than;" but it may, in many places, be rendered "better
   than," or "worse than," according to the import of the passage. -- Ed.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that seeing that we are born in a most corrupt
   age, in which such a license is taken to indulge in wickedness, that
   hardly a spark of virtue appears, -- O grant, that we may yet continue
   upright in the midst of thorns; and do thou so constantly keep us under
   the guidance of thy Word, that we may cultivate true piety, and also
   what is just towards our neighbors: and as there is in us no power to
   preserve ourselves safe, grant that thy Son may so protect us by the
   power of the Holy Spirit, that we may continue to advance towards the
   end of our course, until we be at length gathered into that celestial
   kingdom, which he has procured for us by his own blood. Amen.

   Micah 7:5-6

   5. Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the
   doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.

   5. Ne fidatis amico, ne speretis in consiliario (vel, duce;) ab ea quae
   dormit in sinu tuo custodi aperturas oris tui:

   6. For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against
   her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man's
   enemies are the men of his own house.

   6. Quia filius contumelia afficit patrem, filia surgit contra matrem
   suam, nurus contra socrum suam; inimici viri domestici ejus (homines
   domus ejus, ad verbum.)


   The Prophet pursues the subject we discussed yesterday, -- that
   liberty, in iniquity, bad arrived to its highest point, for no
   faithfulness remained among men; nay, there was no more any humanity;
   for the son performed not his duty towards his father, nor the
   daughter-in-law towards her mother-in-law; in short, there was then no
   mutual love and concord. He does not here speak of that false
   confidence, by which many deceive themselves, who rely on mortals, and
   transfer to them the glory which belongs to God. Those therefore
   without any reason, philosophize here, who say, that we ought not to
   trust in men; for this was not the design of the Prophet. But our
   Prophet complains of his times according to the tenor of Ovid's
   description of the iron age, who says -

   "--A guest is not safe from his host;
   Nor a brother-in-law from a son-in-law; and brotherly love is rare:
   A husband seeks the death of his wife, and she, of her husband;
   Cruel stepmothers mingle the lurid poison;
   The son, before the day, inquires into the years of his father." [187]

   So also our Prophet says, that there was no regard to humanity among
   men; for the wife was ready to betray her husband, the son treated his
   father with reproach; in short, they had all forgotten humanity or
   natural affection. We now then understand what the Prophet means by
   saying, Trust not a friend; [188] that is, if any one hopes for any
   thing from a friend, he will be deceived; for nothing can be found
   among men but perfidy.

   Put no faith in a counselor So I render the word 'lvph, aluph; some
   translate it, an elder brother; but there is no necessity to constrain
   us to depart from the proper and true meaning of the word. As then the
   Prophet had spoken of an associate or a friend, so he now adds a
   counselor. And it proves what he had in view, when he says in the next
   clause, that no enemies are worse than domestics. We hence see that the
   Prophet simply means, that the men of his age were not only avaricious
   and cruel to one another, but that without any regard to human feelings
   the son rebelled against his father, and thus subverted the whole order
   of nature; So that they had none of those affections, which seem at the
   same time to be incapable of being extinguished in men. Let us now
   proceed --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [187] See Ov. Met. Lib. I. 144-148.

   [188] Ne fidatis amico: it is rather, Believe not in a friend, that is,
   in what he says, 'l-t'mynv vr. The next expression is that which
   signifies reliance, trust or confidence. 'lvph, is a leader; egoumenos
   in Sept., one who leads the way. Diodati gives its true meaning, -- "A
   conductor, the most trusty friend, who is one's usual counselor in
   every difficulty and perplexity." Jerome refers to scriptural instances
   as to the persons here mentioned: the friend, Ahitophel and Judas, --
   the counselor, Abimelek, who was made king by the men of Sichem, and
   oppressed them, -- domestics, Absalom and the wives of Esau. The word
   used for "dishonoring" is very strong; mnvl, one who counts a thing
   worthless or abominable; it means not only to dishonor, but to regard
   with disdain and contempt. "The contempt and violation of the laws of
   domestic duties," Henry justly observes, "are a sad symptom of an
   universal corruption of manners. Those are never likely to come to good
   who are undutiful to their parents, and study to be provoking to them
   and cross them." -- Ed.

   Micah 7:7

   7. Therefore I will look unto the Lord; I will wait for the God of my
   salvation: my God will hear me.

   7. Ego autem ad Jehovam respiciam, expectabo ad Deum salutis meae;
   exaudiet me Deus meus.


   The Prophet points out here the only remedy, to preserve the faithful
   from being led away by bad examples and that is, to fix their eyes on
   God, and to believe that he will be their deliverer. Nothing is more
   difficult than to refrain from doing wrong, when the ungodly provoke
   us; for they seem to afford us a good reason for retaliation. And when
   no one injures us, yet custom is deemed almost a law: thus it happens
   that we think that to be lawful which is sanctioned by the manners and
   customs of the age; and when success attends the wicked, this becomes a
   very strong incentive. Thus it happens, that the faithful can hardly,
   and with no small difficulty, keep themselves within proper bounds:
   when they see that wickedness reigns everywhere, and that with
   impunity; and still more, when they see the abettors of wickedness
   increasing in esteem and wealth, immediately the corrupt lust of
   emulation creeps in. But when the faithful themselves are provoked by
   injuries, there seems then to be a just reason for doing wrong; for
   they say that they willfully do harm to no one, but only resist an
   injury done to them, or retaliate fraud with fraud: this they think is
   lawful. The Prophet, in order to prevent this temptation, bids the
   faithful to look to God. The same sentiment we often meet with in Psalm
   119: its import is, that the faithful are not to suffer themselves to
   be led away by bad examples, but to continue ever obedient to God's
   word, however great and violent the provocations they may receive. Let
   us now consider the words of the Prophet.

   To Jehovah, he says, will I look The verb tsphh, tsaphe, properly means
   to look on, to behold; (speculari;) it is sometimes taken in the sense
   of expecting; but I am inclined to retain its proper meaning, I will
   look, he says, on God; that is, I will do the same as though the only
   true God were before my eyes. How indeed does it happen that even the
   good indulge themselves while living among the wicked and ungodly,
   except that they are too much occupied with things around them? If then
   we desire to maintain integrity, while the world presents to us nothing
   but examples of sin, let us learn to pass by these temptations as with
   closed eyes. This may be done, if we direct our eyes to God alone. I
   will look, he says, to Jehovah

   He then adds, I will wait for the God of my salvation The Prophet says
   nothing new here, but only explains more clearly the last clause,
   defining the manner of the looking of which he had spoken; as though he
   said, -- "Patiently will I bear, while God helps me:" for when the
   wicked harass us on every side, we shall no doubt soon turn away our
   eyes from Gods except we be armed with patience. And how comes
   patience, unless we be fully persuaded that God will be our deliverer,
   when the suitable time shall come? We now perceive the intention of the
   Prophet. He shows that the godly cannot otherwise continue constant in
   their integrity, except they turn their eyes to the only true God. Then
   he adds, that they cannot be preserved in this contemplation, unless
   they wait patiently for God, that is, for his help.

   And he calls him the God of his salvation; by which he intimates that,
   relying on his word, he thus perseveres in enduring injuries: for it
   cannot be but that every one will submit himself to God, and surrender
   himself to be protected by him, if this truth be first fixed in his
   mind -- that God will never forsake his own people. This then is the
   reason why he calls him the God of his salvation. But this title must
   be referred to his present circumstances, as though he said, -- "Though
   God's hand does not now appear to help or to bring me aid, I yet feel
   assured of his favor, and I know that my salvation is secured by it."

   He then adds, Hear me will my God He here confirms what we have already
   said, -- that, being supported by the promises of God, he thus composes
   his mind to patience; for patience would often vanish or would be
   shaken off by temptations, unless we were surely persuaded that God
   provides for our salvation, and that we shall not hope in him in vain.
   Nor is it to no purpose that he says, that God was his God. He was one
   of his people; and this seems to have been the common privilege of all
   the Jews: yet the Prophet no doubt connects God with himself here in a
   peculiar manner; for men in general had fallen away into ungodliness.
   They all indeed gloried in the name of God, but absurdly and falsely.
   Hence the Prophet intimates, that he was under his protection in a
   manner different from the rest: for when any one allows himself the
   liberty of doing evil, he, at the same time, renounces God and his
   protection. Therefore, the Prophet no doubt alludes indirectly to the
   irreligion of the people. For though the vain boasting, that they had
   been adopted by God, that they were the holy race of Abraham, was
   everywhere in the mouth of all, yet hardly one in a hundred had any
   regard for God. But it is also of importance to notice, that the
   Prophet, by saying, Hear me will God, gives a testimony, at the same
   time, respecting his own faith, -- that he would always apply to God
   for help, and exercise himself in prayer whenever necessity urged him;
   for God hears not except when he is called upon. The Prophet then
   recommends here, by his example, an attention to prayer.

   Now this verse shows to us in general that there is no excuse for us if
   we suffer ourselves to be led away, as it is daily the case, by bad
   examples. And then to look to God is especially needful, when all
   excesses of wickedness prevail in the world: when the lusts of men
   become the rule and the law, we ought then to renounce in a manner the
   society of men, that they may not implicate us in their wickedness.
   They, therefore, who allege for themselves the examples of others,
   employ a frivolous excuse, as many do in the present day, who set up
   the shield of custom: though they are clearly condemned by the word of
   God, yet they think it a sufficient defense, that they follow others.
   But we see how frivolous is this confidence; for the Prophet no doubt
   prescribes here a law for all the children of God as to what they ought
   to do, when the devil tempts them to sin by the bad examples and
   shameful deeds of the majority. Let us go on --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Micah 7:8

   8. Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise;
   when I sit in darkness, the LORD shall be a light unto me.

   8. Ne gaudeas de me, inimica mea; quia ceciderim, surgam (vel, quamvis
   ceciderim, surgam;) quum sedebo in tenebris, Jehova erit lux mihi.


   Here the Prophet assumes the character of the Church and repels a
   temptation, which proves very severe to us in adversities; for there is
   not so much bitterness in the evil itself, as in the mockery of the
   wicked, when they petulantly insult us and deride our faith. And to
   noble minds reproach is ever sharper than death itself: and yet the
   devil almost always employs this artifice; for when he sees that we
   stand firm in temptations, he suborns the wicked and sharpens their
   tongues to speak evil of use and to wound us with slanders. This is the
   reason why the Prophet directs his discourse now to the enemies of the
   Church. But as God calls the Church his spouse, and as she is described
   to us under the character of a woman, so also he compares here the
   enemies of the holy people to a petulant woman. As, therefore, when
   there is emulation between two women, she, who sees her enemy pressed
   down by evils and adverse events, immediately raises up herself and
   triumphs; so also the Prophet says respecting the enemies of the
   Church; they sharpened their tongues, and vomited forth their
   bitterness, as soon as they saw the children of God in trouble or
   nearly overwhelmed with adversities. We now then understand the design
   of the Prophet, -- that he wished to arm us, as I have said, against
   the taunts of the ungodly, lest they should prevail against us when God
   presses us down with adversities, but that we may stand courageously,
   and with composed and tranquil minds, swallow down the indignity.

   Rejoice not over me, he says, O my enemy Why not? He adds a
   consolation; for it would not be enough for one to repel with disdain
   the taunts of his enemy; but the Prophet says here, Rejoice not, for
   should I fall, I shall rise; or though I fall, I shall rise: and the
   passage seems to harmonize better when there is a pause after Rejoice
   not over me; and then to add, Though I fall, I shall rise, though I sit
   in darkness, Jehovah shall be a light to me [189] The Prophet means,
   that the state of the Church was not past hope. There would be ample
   room for our enemies to taunt us, were it not that this promise cannot
   fail us, -- seven times in the day the just falls, and rises again,
   (Proverbs 24:16.) -- How so? For God puts under him his own hand. We
   now perceive the meaning of this passage. For if God deprived us of all
   hope, enemies might justly deride us, and we must be silent: but since
   we are surely persuaded that God is ready at hand to restore us again,
   we can boldly answer our enemies when they annoy with their derisions;
   though I fall, I shall rise: "There is now no reason for thee to
   triumph over me when I fall; for it is God's will that I should fall,
   but it is for this end -- that I may soon rise again; and though I now
   lie in darkness, yet the Lord will be my light."

   We hence see that our hope triumphs against all temptations: and this
   passage shows in a striking manner, how true is that saying of John, --
   that our faith gains the victory over the world, (1 John 5:4.) For when
   sorrow and trouble take possession of our hearts, we shall not fail if
   this comes to our mind -- that God will be our aid in the time of need.
   And when men vomit forth their poison against us, we ought to be
   furnished with the same weapons: then our minds shall never succumb,
   but boldly repel all the taunts of Satan and of wicked men. This we
   learn from this passage.

   Now, from what the Prophet says, Though I fall, I shall rise again, we
   see what God would have us to expect, even a happy and joyful exit at
   all times from our miseries; but on this subject I shall have to speak
   more copiously a little farther on. As to the latter clause, When I sit
   in darkness, God will be my light, it seems to be a confirmation of the
   preceding sentence, where the Prophet declares, that the fall of the
   Church would not be fatal. But yet some think that more is expressed,
   namely, that in the very darkness some spark of light would still
   shine. They then distinguish between this clause and the former one,
   which speaks of the fall and the rise of the faithful, in this manner,
   -- that while they lie, as it were, sunk in darkness, they shall not
   even then be without consolation, for God's favor would ever shine on
   them. And this seems to be a correct view: for it cannot be that any
   one will expect the deliverance of which the Prophet speaks, except he
   sees some light even in the thickest darkness, and sustains himself by
   partaking, in some measure, of God's goodness: and a taste of God's
   favor in distresses is suitably compared to light; as when one is cast
   into a deep pit, by raising upward his eyes, he sees at a distance the
   light of the sun; so also the obscure and thick darkness of
   tribulations may not so far prevail as to shut out from us every spark
   of light, and to prevent faith from raising our eyes upwards, that we
   may have some taste of God's goodness. Let us proceed --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [189] This is not exactly the Hebrew. The verb for rising, as well as
   that for falling, is in the past tense. The verse, literally rendered,
   is the following: -- Rejoice not, my enemy, on my account;
   Though I have fallen, I have risen;
   Though I shall sit in darkness,
   Jehovah will be a light to me. There are no copies which give a
   different reading as to the verb "I have risen." Newcome follows the
   Septuagint, and thinks that a conversive v is left out. It ought rather
   perhaps to be considered as the language of faith, realizing the event
   before it arrived. The fall and "the darkness" refer no doubt to the
   outward calamities of the Church, its troubles and afflictions. -- Ed.

   Micah 7:9

   9. I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned
   against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he
   will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness.

   9. Iram Jehovae feram, quia peccavi ei, donec disceptet causam meam et
   faciet judicium meum (vel, asserat jus meum;) educet me in lucem,
   cernam justitiam ejus.


   Here the Church of God animates and encourages herself to exercise
   patience, and does so especially by two arguments. She first sets
   before herself her sins, and thus humbles herself before God, whom she
   acknowledges to be a just Judge; and, in the second place, she embraces
   the hope of the forgiveness of her sins, and from this arises
   confidence as to her deliverance. By these two supports the Church
   sustains herself, that she fails not in her troubles, and gathers
   strength, as I have already said, to endure patiently.

   First then he says, The wrath [190] of Jehovah will I bear, for sinned
   have I against him This passage shows, that when any one is seriously
   touched with the conviction of God's judgment, he is at the same time
   prepared to exercise patience; for it cannot be, but that a sinner,
   conscious of evil, and knowing that he suffers justly will humbly and
   thankfully submit to the will of God. Hence when men perversely glamour
   against God, or murmur, it is certain that they have not as yet been
   made sensible of their sins. I allow indeed that many feel guilty who
   yet struggle against God, and fiercely resist his hand as much as they
   can, and also blaspheme his name when he chastises them: but they are
   not touched hitherto with the true feeling of penitence, so as to abhor
   themselves. Judas owned indeed that he had sinned, and freely made such
   confession, (Matthew 27:3.) Cain tried to cover his sin, but the Lord
   drew from him an unwilling confession, (Genesis 4:13.) They did not yet
   repent; nay, they ceased not to contend with God; for Cain complained
   that his punishment was too heavy to be borne; Judas despaired. And the
   same thing happens to all the reprobate. They seemed then to have been
   sufficiently convinced to acknowledge their guilt, and, as it were, to
   assent to the justice of God's judgment; but they did not really know
   their sins, so as to abhor themselves, as I have said, on account of
   their sins. For true penitence is ever connected with the submission of
   which the Prophet now speaks. Whosoever then is really conscious of his
   sins, renders himself at the same time obedient to God, and submits
   himself altogether to his will. Thus repentance does ever of itself
   lead to the bearing of the cross; so that he who sets himself before
   God's tribunal allows himself to be at the same time chastised, and
   bears punishment with a submissive mind: as the ox, that is tamed,
   always takes the yoke without any resistance, so also is he prepared
   who is really touched with the sense of his sins, to bear any
   punishment which God may be pleased to inflict on him. This then is the
   first thing which we ought to learn from these words of the Prophet,
   The wrath of Jehovah will I bear, for sinned have I against him.

   We also learn from this passage, that all who do not patiently bear his
   scourges contend with God; for though they do not openly accuse God,
   and say that they are just, they do not yet ascribe to him his
   legitimate glory, by confessing that he is a righteous judge. -- How
   so? Because these two things are united together and joined by an
   indissoluble knot -- to be sensible of sin -- and to submit patiently
   to the will of the Judge when he inflicts punishment.

   Now follows the other argument, Until he decides my cause, and
   vindicates my right; he will bring me forth into the light, I shall see
   his righteousness Here the Church leans on another support; for though
   the Lord should most heavily afflict her, she would not yet cast aside
   the hope of deliverance; for she knew, as we have already seen, that
   she was chastised for her good: and indeed no one could even for a
   moment continue patient in a state of misery, except he entertained the
   hope of being delivered, and promised to himself a happy escape. These
   two things then ought not to be separated, and cannot be, -- the
   acknowledgment of our sins, which will humble us before God, -- and the
   knowledge of his goodness, and a firm assurance as to our salvation;
   for God has testified that he will be ever propitious to us, how much
   soever he may punish us for our sins, and that he will remember mercy,
   as Habakkuk says, in the midst of his wrath, (Habakkuk 3:2.) It would
   not then be sufficient for us to feel our evils, except the
   consolation, which proceeds from the promises of grace, be added.

   The Prophet shows further, that the Church was innocent, with regard to
   its enemies, though justly suffering punishment. And this ought to be
   carefully observed; for whenever we have to do with the wicked, we
   think that there is no blame belonging to us. But these two things
   ought to be considered, -- that the wicked trouble us without reason,
   and thus our cause as to them is just, -- and yet that we are justly
   afflicted by God; for we shall ever find many reasons why the Lord
   should chastise us. These two things, then, ought to be both considered
   by us, as the Prophet seems to intimate here: for at the beginning of
   the verse he says, The wrath of God will I bear, for sinned have I
   against him; and now he adds, The Lord will yet vindicate my right,
   literally, "will debate my dispute," that is, plead my cause. Since the
   Church is guilty before God, nay, waits not for the sentence of the
   judge, but anticipates it, and freely confesses herself to be worthy of
   such punishment, what does this mean, -- that the Lord will decide her
   quarrel, that he will undertake her cause? These two things seem to
   militate the one against the other: but they agree well together when
   viewed in their different bearings. The Church had confessed that she
   had sinned against God; she now turns her eyes to another quarter; for
   she knew that she was unjustly oppressed by enemies; she knew that they
   were led to do wrong by cruelty alone. This then is the reason why the
   Church entertained hope, and expected that God would become the
   defender of her innocence, that is, against the wicked: and yet she
   humbly acknowledged that she had sinned against God. Whenever, then,
   our enemies do us harm, let us lay hold on this truth, -- that God will
   become our defender; for he is ever the patron of justice and equity:
   it cannot then be, that God will abandon us to the violence of the
   wicked. He will then at length plead our pleading, or undertake our
   cause, and be its advocate. But, in the meantime, let our sins be
   remembered by us, that, being truly humbled before God, we may not hope
   for the salvation which he promises to us, except through gratuitous
   pardon. Why then are the faithful bidden to be of good comfort in their
   afflictions? Because God has promised to be their Father; he has
   received them under his protection, he has testified that his help
   shall never be wanting to them. But whence is this confidence? Is it
   because they are worthy? Is it because they have deserved something of
   this kind? By no means: but they acknowledge themselves to be guilty,
   when they humbly prostrate themselves before God, and when they
   willingly condemn themselves before his tribunal, that they may
   anticipate his judgment. We now see how well the Prophet connects
   together these two things, which might otherwise seem contradictory.

   Now follow the words, He will bring me to the light, I shall see his
   righteousness! [191] The Church still confirms herself in the hope of
   deliverance: art it is hence also manifest how God is light to the
   faithful in obscure darkness, because they see that there is prepared
   for them an escape from their evils; but they see it at a distance, for
   they extend their hope beyond the boundaries of this life. As then the
   truth of God diffuses itself through heaven and earth, so the faithful
   extend their hope far and wide. Thus it is, that they can see light
   afar off, which seems to be very remote from them. And having this
   confidence, the Prophet says, The Lord will bring me into the light.
   They have, in the meantime, as I have already said, some light; they
   enjoy a taste of God's goodness in the midst of their evils: but the
   Prophet now refers to that coming forth which we ought to look for even
   in the worst circumstances.

   He then adds, I shall see his righteousness By God's righteousness is
   to be understood, as it has been elsewhere stated, his favor towards
   the faithful; not that God returns for their works the salvation which
   he bestows, as ungodly men foolishly imagine; for they lay hold on the
   word righteousness, and think that whatever favors God freely grants us
   are due to our merits. -- How so? For God in this way shows his own
   righteousness. But far different is the reason for this mode of
   speaking. God, in order to show how dear and precious to him is our
   salvation, does indeed say, that he designs to give an evidence of his
   justice in delivering us: but there is a reference in this word
   righteousness to something else; for God has promised that our
   salvation shall be the object of his care, hence he appears just
   whenever he delivers us from our troubles. Then the righteousness of
   God is not to be referred to the merits of works, but, on the contrary,
   to the promise by which he has bound himself to us; and so also in the
   same dense God is often said to be faithful. In a word, the
   righteousness and faithfulness of God mean the same thing. When the
   Prophet says now in the person of the Church, I shall see his
   righteousness, he means, that though God concealed his favor for a
   time, and withdrew his hand, so that no hope of aid remained, it could
   not yet be, as he is just, but that he would succor us: I shall see
   then his righteousness, that is, God will at length really show that he
   is righteous. It now follows --

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that seeing we are at this day surrounded by so
   many miseries, yea, wherever we turn our eyes, innumerable evils meet
   us everywhere, which are so many evidences of thy displeasure, -- O
   grant, that we being truly humbled before thee, may be enabled at the
   same time to raise up our eyes to the promises of thy free goodness and
   paternal favor, which thou hast made to us in thine own Son, that we
   may not doubt, but that thou wilt be propitious to us, inasmuch as thou
   hast adopted us as thy people: and while our enemies, fully armed, rage
   and ferociously rise even daily against us, may we not doubt, but that
   thou wilt be our protection, as thou knowest that we are unjustly
   troubled by them; and may we thus go on, trusting in thy goodness,
   seeing that we ever groan under the, burden of our sins, and daily
   confess that we are worthy of thousand deaths before thee, wert not
   thou pleased in thine infinite mercy always to receive and restore us
   to favor, through thy Son our Lord. Amen.

   Lecture Ninety-seventh

   In the last lecture I repeated the tenth verse of the last chapter, in
   which the prophet adds, as a cause of the greatest joy, that the
   enemies of the Church shall see granted, to their great mortification,
   the wonderful favor of which the Prophet had been speaking. But he
   describes these enemies, under the character of an envious woman, as
   the Church of God is also compared to a woman: and this mode of
   speaking is common in Scripture. He then calls Jerusalem his rival, or
   Babylon, or some city of his enemies.

   And he says, Covered shall she be with shame We know that the ungodly
   grow insolent when fortune smiles on them: hence in prosperity they
   keep within no bounds, for they think that God is under their feet. If
   prosperity most commonly has the effect of making the godly to forget
   God and even themselves, it is no wonder that the unbelieving become
   more and more hardened, when God is indulgent to them. With regard then
   to such a pride, the Prophet now says, When my enemy shall see, shame
   shall cover her; that is, she will not continue in her usual manner, to
   elate herself with her own boastings: nay, she will be compelled for
   shame to hide herself; for she will see that she had been greatly
   deceived, in thinking that I should be wholly ruined.

   He afterwards adds, Who said to me, Where is Jehovah thy God? The
   Church of God in her turn triumphs here over the unbelieving, having
   been delivered by divine power; nor does she do this for her own sake,
   but because the ungodly expose the holy name of God to reproach, which
   is very common: for whenever God afflicts his people, the unbelieving
   immediately raise their crests, and pour forth their blasphemies
   against God, when yet they ought, on the contrary, to humble themselves
   under his hand. But since God executes his judgments on the faithful,
   what can be expected by his ungodly despisers? If God's vengeance be
   manifested in a dreadful manner with regard to the green tree, what
   will become of the dry wood? And the ungodly are like the dry wood. But
   as they are blind as to God's judgments, they petulantly deride his
   name, whenever they see the Church afflicted, as though adversities
   were not the evidences of God's displeasure: for he chastises his own
   children, to show that he is the judge of the world. But, as I have
   already said, the ungodly so harden themselves in their stupor, that
   they are wholly thoughtless. The faithful, therefore, after having
   found God to be their deliverer, do here undertake his cause; they do
   not regard themselves nor their own character, but defend the
   righteousness of God. Such is this triumphant language, Who said, Where
   is now Jehovah thy God? "I can really show that I worship the true God,
   who deserts not his people in extreme necessity: after he has assisted
   me, my enemy, who dared to rise up against God, now seeks
   hiding-places."

   She shall now, he says, be trodden under foot as the mire of the
   streets; and my eyes shall see her. What the Prophet declares in the
   name of the Church, that the unbelieving shall be like mire, is
   connected with the promise, which we already noticed; for God so
   appears as the deliverer of his Church, as not to leave its enemies
   unpunished. God then, while he aids his own people, leads the ungodly
   to punishment. Hence the Church, while embracing the deliverance
   offered to her, at the same time sees the near ruin, which impends on
   all the despisers of God. But what is stated, See shall my eyes, ought
   not to be so taken, as though the faithful exult with carnal joy, when
   they see the ungodly suffering the punishment which they have deserved;
   for the word to see is to be taken metaphorically, as signifying a
   pleasant and joyful sight, according to what it means in many other
   places; and as it is a phrase which often occurs, its meaning must be
   well known. See then shall my eyes, that is, "I shall enjoy to look on
   that calamity, which now impends over all the ungodly." But, as I have
   already said, carnal joy is not what is here intended, which
   intemperately exults, but that pure joy which the faithful experience
   on seeing the grace of God displayed and also his judgment. But this
   joy cannot enter into our hearts until they be cleansed from unruly
   passions; for we are ever excessive in fear and sorrow, as well as in
   hope and joy, except the Lord holds us in, as it were, with a bridle.
   We shall therefore be only then capable of this spiritual joy, of which
   the Prophet speaks, when we shall put off all disordered feelings, and
   God shall subdue us by his Spirit: then only shall we be able to retain
   moderation in our joy. The Prophet proceeds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Micah 7:11-12

   11. In the day that thy walls are to be built, in that day shall the
   decree be far removed.

   11. Dies ad aedificandum parietes tuos; dies iste procul abiget
   edictum.

   12. In that day also he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and from
   the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from
   sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.

   12. Die isto etiam ad te veniet ab Assur, et urbibus munitionis, et a
   munitione etiam ad fluvium, et ad mare a mari, et a monte ad montem.


   Micah pursues the subject on which he had previously spoken, -- that
   though the Church thought itself for a time to be wholly lost, yet God
   would become its deliverer. He says first, that the day was near, in
   which they were to build the wall. The word gdr, gidar, means either a
   mound or a wall; so it ought to be distinguished from a wall, that is,
   a strong fortress. He then intimates that the time would come, when God
   would gather his Church, and preserve it, as though it were defended on
   every side by walls. For we know that the scattering of the Church is
   compared to the pulling down of walls or fences: as when a person pulls
   down the fence of a field or a vineyard, or breaks down all enclosures;
   so when the Church is exposed as a prey to all, she is said to be like
   an open field or a vineyard, which is without any fence. Now, on the
   other hand, the Prophet says here, that the time would come, when the
   faithful shall again build walls, by which they may be protected from
   the assaults and plunder of enemies, A day then to build thy walls

   Then he adds, This day shall drive afar off the edict; some render it
   tribute; but the word properly means an edict, and this best suits the
   passage; for the Prophet's meaning is, that the people would not, as
   before, be subject to the tyranny of Babylon. For after the subversion
   of Jerusalem, the Babylonians, no doubt, triumphed very unfeelingly
   over the miserable people, and uttered dreadful threatening. The
   Prophet, therefore, under the name of edict, includes that cruel and
   tyrannical dominion which the Babylonians for a time exercised. We know
   what God denounces on the Jews by Ezekiel,

   Ye would not keep my good laws;
   I will therefore give you laws which are not good,
   which ye shall be constrained to keep;
   and yet ye shall not live in them,'
   (Ezekiel 20:25.)

   Those laws which were not good were the edicts of which the Prophet now
   speaks. That day then shall drive far away the edict, that the Jews
   might not dread the laws of their enemies. For the Babylonians no doubt
   forbade, under the severest punishment, any one from building even a
   single house in the place where Jerusalem formerly was; for they wished
   that place to remain desolate, that the people might know that they had
   no hope of restoration. That day then shall put afar off; or drive to a
   distance, the edict; for liberty shall be given to the Jews to build
   their city; and then they shall not tremblingly expect every hour,
   until new edicts come forth, denouncing grievous punishments on
   whomsoever that would dare to encourage his brethren to build the
   temple of God.

   Some draw the Prophet's words to another meaning: they first think that
   he speaks only of the spiritual kingdom of Christ, and then they take
   rchq, rechek, in the sense of extending or propagating, and consider
   this to be the Gospel which Christ, by the command of the Father,
   promulgated through the whole world. It is indeed true that David uses
   the word decree in Psalm 2, while speaking of the preaching of the
   Gospel; and it is also true, that the promulgation of that decree is
   promised in Psalm 110, The rod of his power will Jehovah send forth
   from Zion.' But this passage ought not to be thus violently perverted;
   for the Prophet no doubt means, that the Jews would be freed from all
   dread of tyranny when God restored them to liberty; and rchq, rechek,
   does not mean to extend or propagate, but to drive far away. That day
   then shall drive away the decree, so that the faithful shall be no more
   subject to tyrannical commands. We now perceive the true meaning of the
   Prophet.

   The faithful doubtless prayed in their adversities, and depended on
   such prophecies as we find in Psalm 102,

   The day is now come to show mercy to Zion, and to build its walls; for
   thy servants pity her stones.'

   Nor did the faithful pray thus presumptuously, but taking confidence,
   as though God had dictated a form of prayer by his own mouth, they
   dealt with God according to his promise, "O Lord, thou hast promised
   the rebuilding of the city, and the time has been prefixed by Jeremiah
   and by other Prophets: since then the time is now completed, grant that
   the temple and the holy city may again be built."

   Some render the words, "In the day in which thou shalt build (or God
   shall build) thy walls -- in that day shall be removed afar off the
   decree." But I doubt not but that the Prophet promises here distinctly
   to the faithful both the restoration of the city and a civil freedom;
   for the sentence is in two parts: the Prophet intimates first, that the
   time was now near when the faithful would build their own walls, that
   they might not be exposed to the will of their enemies, -- and then he
   adds, that they would be freed from the dread of tyranny; for God, as
   it is said by Isaiah, would break the yoke of the burden, and the
   scepter of the oppressor, (Isaiah 9:4;) and it is altogether the same
   kind of sentence.

   He afterwards adds, In that day also to thee shall they come from
   Asshur. There is some obscurity in the words; hence interpreters have
   regarded different words as being understood: but to me the meaning of
   the Prophet appears not doubtful. In that day, he says, to thee shall
   they come from Asshur, and cities of the fortress and from the fortress
   even to the river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain;
   but some think hr, er, to be a proper name, and render the last clause,
   "And from mount Hor:" and we know that Aaron was buried on this mount.
   But the Prophet, no doubt, alludes here to some other place; and to
   render it mount Hor is a strained version. I doubt not, therefore, but
   that the Prophet repeats a common name, as though he said, "From
   mountains to mountains."

   Let us now see what the Prophet means. With regard to the passage, as I
   have said, there is no ambiguity, provided we bear in mind the main
   subject. Now the Prophet had this in view, -- That Jerusalem, when
   restored by God, would be in such honor along all nations that there
   would be flowing to her from all parts. He then says, that the state of
   the city would be very splendid, so that people from all quarters would
   come to it: and therefore the copulative vau is to be taken twice for
   even for the sake of emphasis, In that day, even to thee, and then,
   even to the river; for it was not believed that Jerusalem would have
   any dignity, after it had been entirely destroyed, together with the
   temple. It is no wonder then that the Prophet so distinctly confirms
   here what was by no means probable, at least according to the common
   sentiments of men, -- that Jerusalem would attract to itself all
   nations, even those far away. Come, then, shall they, (for the verb
   yvv', ibua, in the singular number must be taken indefinitely as having
   a plural meaning,) Come, then, shall they from Asshur even to thee. But
   the Assyrians had previously destroyed every land, overturned the
   kingdom of Israel, and almost blotted out its name; and they had also
   laid waste the kingdom of Judah; a small portion only remained. They
   came afterwards, we know, with the Chaldeans, after the seat of empire
   was translated to Babylon, and destroyed Nineveh. Therefore, by naming
   the Assyrians, he no doubt, taking a part for the whole, included the
   Babylonians. Come, then, shall they from Asshur, and then, from the
   cities of the fortress, that is, from every fortress. For they who take
   tsvr, tsur, for Tyre are mistaken; for mtsvr, metsur [192] is mentioned
   twice, and it means citadels and strongholds. And then, even to the
   river, that is, to utmost borders of Euphrates; for many take
   Euphrates, by way of excellence, to be meant by the word river; as it
   is often the case in Scripture; though it might be not less fitly
   interpreted of any or every river, as though the Prophet had said, that
   there would be no obstacle to stop their course who would hasten to
   Jerusalem. Even to the river then, and from sea to sea, that is, they
   shall come in troops from remote countries, being led by the celebrity
   of the holy city; for when it shall be rebuilt by God's command, it
   shall acquire new and unusual honor, so that all people from every part
   shall assemble there. And then, from mountain to mountain, that is,
   from regions far asunder. This is the sum of the whole.

   The Prophet then promises what all men deemed as fabulous, -- that the
   dignity of the city Jerusalem should be so great after the return of
   the Jews from exile, that it would become, as it were, the metropolis
   of the world. One thing must be added: They who confine this passage to
   Christ seem not indeed to be without a plausible reason; for there
   follows immediately a threatening as to the desolation of the land; and
   there seems to be some inconsistency, except we consider the Prophet
   here as comparing the Church collected from all nations with the
   ancient people. But these things will harmonize well together if we
   consider, that the Prophet denounces vengeance on the unbelieving who
   then lived, and that he yet declares that God will be merciful to his
   chosen people. But the restriction which they maintain is too rigid;
   for we know that it was usual with the Prophets to extend the favor of
   God from the return of the ancient people to the coming of Christ.
   Whenever, then, the Prophets make known God's favor in the deliverance
   of his people, they make a transition to Christ, but included also the
   whole intermediate time. And this mode the Prophet now pursues, and it
   ought to be borne in mind by us. Let us go on --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [192] It is somewhat singular that Newcome renders the first "fenced"
   and the second "Egypt:" but Henderson renders both "Egypt." It is not
   the common name for Egypt, which is mtsrym; the places referred to, 2
   Kings 19:24, and Isaiah 19:6, do not justify this application. The word
   "day" in three instances is here without a preposition: it may
   therefore be regarded as the nominative absolute, or the verb, is nigh,
   or approaches, as Jerome proposes, is understood. I would give this
   version of the two verses, -- 11. The day for building thy walls!
   That day! Removed far shall be the decree: 12. That day! Even to thee
   shall they come,
   From Assyria and cities of fortress,
   And from the fortress even to the river,
   And from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain,
   or, word for word,
   And from the fortress even to the river and the sea,
   From the sea and the mountain of the mountain. The last expression
   seems to mean, "every mountain." -- Ed.

   Micah 7:13

   13. Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that
   dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.

   13. Et erit terra in desolationem propter incolas suos, a fructu
   operorum ipsorum.


   The Prophet, as I have already said, seems to be inconsistent with
   himself: for after having spoken of the restoration of the land, he now
   abruptly says, that it would be deserted, because God had been
   extremely provoked by the wickedness of the people. But, as I have
   stated before, it was almost an ordinary practice with the Prophets, to
   denounce at one time God's vengeance on all the Jews, and then
   immediately to turn to the faithful, who were small in number, and to
   raise up their minds with the hope of deliverance. We indeed know that
   the Prophets had to do with the profane despisers of God; it was
   therefore necessary for them to fulminate, when they addressed the
   whole body of the people: the contagion had pervaded all orders, so
   that they were all become apostates, from the highest to the lowest,
   with very few exceptions, and those hidden amidst the great mass, like
   a few grains in a vast heap of chaff. Then the Prophets did not without
   reason mingle consolations with threatening; and their threatening they
   addressed to the whole body of the people; and then they whispered, as
   it were, in the ear, some consolation to the elect of God, the few
   remnants, -- "Yet the Lord will show mercy to you; though he has
   resolved to destroy his people, ye shall yet remain safe, but this will
   be through some hidden means." Our Prophet then does, on the one hand,
   as here, denounce God's vengeance on a people past remedy; and, on the
   others he speaks of the redemption of the Church, that by this support
   the faithful might be sustained in their adversities.

   He now says, The land shall be for desolation [193] But why does he
   speak in so abrupt a manner? That he might drive hypocrites from that
   false confidence, with which they were swollen though God addressed not
   a word to them: but when God pronounced any thing, as they covered
   themselves with the name of Church, they then especially laid hold of
   any thing that was said to the faithful, as though it belonged to them:
   "Has not God promised that he will be the deliverer of his people?" as
   though indeed he was to be their deliverer, who had alienated
   themselves by their perfidy from him; and yet this was a very common
   thing among them. Hence the Prophet, seeing that hypocrites would
   greedily lay hold on what he had said, and by taking this handle would
   become more audacious, says now, The land shall be for desolation, that
   is, "Be ye gone; for when God testifies that he will be the deliverer
   of his Church, he does not address you; for ye are the rotten members;
   and the land shall be reduced to a waste before God's favor, of which I
   now speak, shall appear." We now then perceive the reason for this
   passage, why the Prophet so suddenly joined threatenings to promises:
   it was, to terrify hypocrites.

   He says, On account of its inhabitants, from the fruit, or, on account
   of the fruit of their works Here the Prophet closes the door against
   the despisers of God, lest they should break forth, according to their
   custom, and maintain that God was, as it were, bound to them: "See," he
   says, "what ye are; for ye have polluted the land with your vices; it
   must therefore be reduced to desolation." And when the land, which is
   in itself innocent, is visited with judgment, what will become of those
   despisers whose wickedness it sustains? We hence see how emphatical was
   this mode of speaking. For the Prophet summons here all the unbelieving
   to examine their life, and then he sets before them the land, which was
   to suffer punishment, though it had committed no sin; and why was it to
   suffer? because it was polluted as I have said by their wickedness.
   Since this was the case, we see, that hypocrites were very justly
   driven away from the false confidence with which they were inflated,
   while they yet proudly despised God and his Word. It now follows --

   Micah 7:14

   14. Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which
   dwell solitarily in the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in
   Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.

   14. Pasce populum tuum in virga tua (vel, paedo tuo) gregem
   haereditatis tuae, habitantes in solitudine (vel, seorsum) in sylva, in
   medio Carmeli; pascentur in Basan et Gilead, secundum dies antiquos.


   Here the Prophet turns to supplications and prayers; by which he
   manifests more vehemence, than if he had repeated again what he had
   previously said of the restoration of the Church; for he shows how
   dreadful that judgment would be, when God would reduce the land into
   solitude. This prayer no doubt contains what was at the same time
   prophetic. The Prophet does not indeed simply promise deliverance to
   the faithful, but at the same time he doubly increases that terror; by
   which he designed to frighten hypocrites; as though he said, "Most
   surely except God will miraculously preserve his own people, it is all
   over with the Church: there is then no remedy, except through the
   ineffable power of God." In short, the Prophet shows, that he trembled
   at that vengeance, which he had previously foretold, and which he did
   foretell, lest hypocrites, in their usual manner, should deride him. We
   now see why the Prophet had recourse to this kind of comfort, why he so
   regulates his discourse as not to afford immediate hope to the
   faithful, but addresses God himself. Feed then thy people; as though he
   said, -- "Surely that calamity will be fatal, except thou, Lord, wilt
   be mindful of thy covenant, and gather again some remnant from the
   people whom thou hast been pleased to choose: Feed thy people."

   The reason why he called them the people of God was, because they must
   all have perished, unless it had been that it was necessary that what
   God promised to Abraham should be fulfilled, --

   In thy seed shall all nations be blessed,' (Genesis 12:3.)

   It was then the adoption of God alone which prevented the total
   destruction of the Jews. Hence he says emphatically, -- O Lord, these
   are yet thy people; as though he said, -- "By whom wilt thou now form a
   Church for thyself?" God might indeed have collected it from the
   Gentiles, and have made aliens his family; but it was necessary that
   the root of adoption should remain in the race of Abraham, until Christ
   came forth. Nor was there then any dispute about God's power, as there
   is now among fanatics, who ask, Can God do this? But there was reliance
   on the promise, and from this they learnt with certainty what God had
   once decreed, and what he would do. Since then this promise, By thy
   seed shall all nations be blessed,' was sacred and inviolable, the
   grace of God must have ever continued in the remnant. It is indeed
   certain, that hypocrites, as it has been already stated, without any
   discrimination, abused the promises of God; but this truth must be ever
   borne in mind, that God punished the ungodly, though relying on their
   great number, they thought that they would be always preserved. God
   then destroyed them, as they deserved; and yet it was his purpose, that
   some remnant should be among that people. But it must be observed, that
   this distinction ought not to be extended to all the children of
   Abraham, who derived their origin from him according to the flesh, but
   to be applied to the faithful, that is, to the remnant, who were
   preserved according to the gratuitous adoption of God.

   Feed then thy people by thy crook [194] He compares God to a shepherd,
   and this metaphor often occurs. Though svt, shebeth, indeed signifies a
   scepter when kings are mentioned, it is yet taken also for a pastoral
   staff, as in Psalm 23 and in many other places. As then he represents
   God here as a Shepherd, so he assigns a crook to him; as though he
   said, O Lord, thou performest the office of a Shepherd in ruling this
   people. How so? He immediately confirms what I have lately said, that
   there was no hope of a remedy except through the mercy of God, by
   adding, the flock [195] of thine heritage; for by calling them the
   flock of his heritage, he does not consider what the people deserved,
   but fixes his eyes on their gratuitous adoption. Since, then, it had
   pleased God to choose that people, the Prophet on this account dares to
   go forth to God's presence, and to plead their gratuitous election, --
   "O Lord, I will not bring before thee the nobility of our race, or any
   sort of dignity, or our piety, or any merits." What then? "We are thy
   people, for thou best declared that we are a royal priesthood. We are
   then thine heritage." How so? "Because it has been thy pleasure to have
   one peculiar people sacred to thee." We now more clearly see that the
   Prophet relied on God's favor alone, and opposed the recollection of
   the covenant to the trials which might have otherwise made every hope
   to fail.

   He afterwards adds, Who dwell apart, or alone. He no doubt refers here
   to the dispersion of the people, when he says, that they dwelt alone.
   For though the Jews had been scattered in countries delightful, fertile
   and populous, yet they were everywhere as in a desert and in solitude,
   for they were a mutilated body. The whole of Chaldea and of Assyria was
   then really a desert to the faithful; for there they dwelt not as one
   people, but as members torn asunder. This is the dispersion intended by
   the words of the Prophet. He also adds, that dwell in the forest For
   they had no secure habitation except in their own country; for they
   lived there under the protection of God; and all other countries, as I
   have already said, were to them like the desert.

   He adds, In the midst of Carmel The preposition k, caph, is to be
   understood here, As in the midst of Carmel, they shall be fed in Bashan
   and Gilead, as in ancient days; [196] that is, though they are now thy
   solitary sheep, yet thou wilt gather them again that they may feed as
   on Carmel, (which we know was very fruitful,) and then, as in Bashan
   and Gilead. We know that there are in those places the richest
   pastures. Since then the Prophet compares the faithful to sheep, he
   mentions Bashan, he mentions Carmel and Gilead; as though he said,
   "Restore, O Lord, thy people, that they may dwell in the heritage once
   granted them by thee." Why he says that they were solitary, I have
   already explained; and there is a similar passage in Psalm 102:17;
   though there is there a different word, rr, oror; but the meaning is
   the same. The faithful are there said to be solitary, because they were
   not collected into one body; for this was the true happiness of the
   people, -- that they worshipped God together, that they were under one
   head, and also that they had one altar as a sacred bond to cherish
   unity of faith. When therefore the faithful were scattered here and
   there they were justly said to be solitary, wherever they were.

   He afterwards adds, according to ancient days Here he places before God
   the favors which he formerly showed to his people, and prays that he
   would, like himself, go on to the end, that is that he would continue
   to the end his favors to his chosen people. And it availed not a little
   to confirm their faith, when the faithful called to mind how liberally
   had God dealt from the beginning with the posterity of Abraham: they
   were thus made to feel assured, that God would be no less kind to his
   elect, though there might be, so to speak, a sad separation: for when
   God had banished the Jews into exile, it was a kind of divorce, as
   though they were given to utter destruction. Yet now when they
   recollect that they had descended from the holy fathers, and that a
   Redeemer had been promised them, they justly entertain a hope of favor
   in future from the past benefits of God, because he had formerly kindly
   treated his people.

   [194] "The crook signifies God's peculiar care for his people." --
   Grotius.

   [195] "He compares the elect people," says Marckius, "to a flock of
   sheep, because they resemble them in weakness, in innocency, in
   meekness, in usefulness, in fruitfulness, and in close union. See Psalm
   95:7; Isaiah 40:11; Ezekiel 34:12; Zechariah 9:16, 10:3; John 10:16,
   etc." "They are thy sheep, thy peculiar property, who hear thee, who
   need thy guidance and feeding, for they are weak and helpless, and
   liable to go astray without the preserving care of their Shepherd." --
   Cocceius.

   [196] These two lines are better arranged by Newcome, and the necessity
   of a preposition understood is obviated, while the original is more
   strictly rendered, -- In the midst of Carmel let them feed,
   In Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old. It is also better to
   render "feed" as a prayer than in the future tense, to correspond in
   tenor with the beginning of the verse. Henderson connects "Carmel" with
   the former line, and thinks that "dwelling alone in the wood" refers to
   the condition of the Jews when restored, and quotes the prophecy of
   Balaam in Numbers 23:9. But this seems to be a far-fetched exposition;
   and the word "wood," which means generally a dreary place, renders it
   wholly inadmissible. A state of destitution and misery is evidently
   intended. "They were now," says Henry, "a desolate people; they were in
   the land of their captivity as sheep in a forest, in danger of being
   lost and made a prey to the beasts of the forest." -- Ed.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that since we have so provoked thy displeasure by
   our sins, that a dreadful waste and solitude appear everywhere -- O
   grant, that a proof of that favor, which thou hast so remarkably
   exhibited towards thy ancient people, may shine upon us, so that thy
   Church may be raised up in which true religion may flourish, and thy
   name be glorified: and may we daily solicit thee in our prayers and
   never doubt, but that under the government of thy Christ, thou canst
   again gather together the whole world, though it be miserably
   dispersed, so that we may persevere in this warfare to the end, until
   we shall at length know that we have not in vain hoped in thee, and
   that our prayers have not been in vain, when Christ shall exercise the
   power given to him for our salvation and for that of the whole world.
   Amen.

   Micah 7:15

   15. According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I
   shew unto him marvellous things

   15. Secundum dies egressus tui e terra AEgypti, ostendam ei mirabilia.


   The Prophet here introduces God as the speaker; and he so speaks as to
   give an answer to his prayer. God then promises that he will be
   wonderful in his works, and give such evidences of his power, as he
   exhibited when he brought up his people from the land of Egypt. We now
   see that there is more force in this passage, than if the Prophet had
   at first said, that God would become the deliverer of his people: for
   he interposed entreaty and prayer and God now shows that he will be
   merciful to his people; and at the same time the faithful are reminded,
   that they must be instant in prayer, if they desire to be preserved by
   God.

   Now God says that he will show wonderful things, as when the people
   formerly came out of Egypt. [197] That redemption, we know, was a
   perpetual monument of God's power in the preservation of his Church; so
   that whenever he designs to give some hope of deliverances he reminds
   the faithful of those miracles that they may feel assured that there
   will be no obstacles to prevent them from continuing in a state of
   safety, provided God will be pleased to help them, for his power is not
   diminished.

   And this deserves to be noticed; for though we all allow the
   omnipotence of God, yet when we struggle with trials, we tremble, as
   though all the avenues to our preservation had been closed up against
   God. As soon then as any impediment is thrown in our way, we think that
   there is no hope. Whence is this? It is because we make no account of
   God's power, which yet we confess to be greater than that of the whole
   world.

   This is the reason why God now refers to the miracles which he wrought
   at the coming forth of the people. They ought to have known, that God
   ever continues like himself, and that his power remains as perfect as
   it was formerly; and there is in him sufficient support to encourage
   the hope of assistance. We now perceive the object of the Prophet. He
   indeed changes the persons; for in the beginning he addresses the
   people, according to the days of thy going forth, and then he adds,
   'r'ny, aranu, I will make him to see;' but this change does not obscure
   the meaning, for God only means, that his power was sufficiently known
   formerly to his people, and that there was a memorable proof of it in
   their redemption, so that the people could not have doubted respecting
   their safety, without being ungrateful to God, and without burying in
   oblivion that so memorable a benefit, which God once conferred on their
   fathers. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [197] "The Prophet prayed that God would feed them, and do kind things
   for them; but God answers, that he will show them marvelous things,
   will outdo their hopes and expectations. -- Their deliverance from
   Babylon shall be a work of wonder and grace, not inferior to their
   deliverance out of Egypt, nay, it shall eclipse the luster of that,
   Jeremiah 16:14, 15. -- God's former favors to his Church are patterns
   of future favors, and shall again be copied out as there is occasion."
   -- Henry.

   Micah 7:16-17

   16. The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they
   shall lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears shall be deaf.

   16. Videbunt gentes et pudefient ab omni fortitudine sua; ponent manum
   super os, aures eorum surdescent:

   17. They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of
   their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the Lord
   our God, and shall fear because of thee.

   17. Lingent pulverem quasi serpens, quasi reptilia terrae frement (vel,
   movebunt) a latibulis suis; ad Jehovam Deum nostrum pavebunt, et
   metuent sibi abs te.


   Here again the Prophet shows, that though the Church should be assailed
   on every side and surrounded by innumerable enemies, no doubt ought yet
   to be entertained respecting the promised aid of God; for it is in his
   power to make all nations ashamed, that is, to cast down all the pride
   of the world, so as to make the unbelieving to acknowledge at length
   that they were elated by an empty confidence. Hence he says, that the
   nations shall see; as though he said, "I know what makes you anxious,
   for many enemies are intent on your ruin; and when any help appears,
   they are immediately prepared fiercely to resist; but their attempts
   and efforts will not prevent God from delivering you."

   They shall then see and be ashamed of all their strength [198] By these
   words the Prophet means, that however strongly armed the unbelieving
   may think themselves to be to destroy the Church, and that how many
   obstacles soever they may have in their power to restrain the power of
   God in its behalf, yet the whole will be in vain, for God will, in
   fact, prove that the strength of men is mere nothing.

   He adds, They shall lay their hand on their mouth; that is, they shall
   not dare to boast hereafter, as they have hitherto done; for this
   phrase in Hebrew means to be silent. Since then the enemies of the
   Church made great boastings and exulted with open mouth, as though the
   people of God were destroyed, the Prophet says, that when God would
   appear as the Redeemer of his people, they should become, as it were,
   mute. He subjoins, their ears shall become deaf; [199] that is, they
   shall stand astounded; nay, they shall hardly dare to open their ears,
   lest the rumor, brought to them, should occasion to them new trembling.
   Proud men, we know, when matters succeed according to their wishes, not
   only boast of their good fortune with open mouths, but also greedily
   catch at all rumors; for as they think they are all so many messages of
   victories, -- "What is from this place? or what is from that place?"
   They even expect that the whole world will come under their power. The
   Prophet, on the other hand, says, "They shall lay the hand on the
   mouth, and their ears shall become deaf; that is they shall tremblingly
   shun all rumors, for they shall continually dread new calamities, when
   they shall see that the God of Israel, against who they have hitherto
   fought, is armed with so much power.

   Some apply this to the preaching of the Gospel; which I readily allow,
   provided the deliverance be made always to begin with the ancient
   people: for if any one would have this to be understood exclusively of
   Christ, such a strained and remote exposition would not be suitable.
   But if any one will consider the favor of God, as continued from the
   return of the people to the restoration effected by Christ, he will
   rightly comprehend the real design of the Prophet. Really fulfilled,
   then, is what the Prophet says here, when God spreads the doctrine of
   his Gospel through the whole world: for those who before boasted of
   their own inventions, begin then to close their mouth, that, being thus
   silent, they may become his disciples; and they also close their ears,
   for now they give not up themselves, as before, to foolish and puerile
   fables, but consecrate their whole hearing to the only true God, that
   they may attend only to his truth, and no more vacillate between
   contrary opinions. All this, I allow, is fulfilled under the preaching
   of the Gospel; but the Prophet, no doubt, connected together the whole
   time, from the return of the people from the Babylonian exile, to the
   manifestation of Christ.

   He afterwards adds, They shall lick the dust as a serpent He intimates,
   that however the enemies of the Church may have proudly exalted
   themselves before, they shall then be cast down, and lie, as it were,
   on the ground; for to lick the dust is nothing else but to lie
   prostrate on the earth. They shall then be low and creeping like
   serpents; and then, They shall move themselves as worms and reptiles of
   the ground The verb rgz, regez, as it has been stated elsewhere, means
   to raise an uproar, to tumultuate, and it means also to move one's
   self; and this latter meaning is the most suitable here, namely, that
   they shall go forth or move themselves from their enclosures; for the
   word sgr, sager, signifies to close up: and by enclosures he means
   hiding-places, though in the song of David, in Psalm 18:, the word is
   applied to citadels and other fortified places, --

   Men,' he says, trembled from their fortresses;'

   though they occupied well-fortified citadels, they yet were afraid,
   because the very fame of David had broken down their boldness. But as
   the Prophet speaks here of worms, I prefer this rendering, -- from
   their lurkingplaces;' as though he said, "Though they have hitherto
   thought themselves safe in their enclosures, they shall yet move and
   flee away like worms and reptiles; for when the ground is dug, the
   worms immediately leap out, for they think that they are going to be
   taken; so also, when any one moves the ground, the reptiles come forth,
   and tremblingly run away in all directions." And the Prophet says that,
   in like manner, the enemies of the Church, when the Lord shall arise
   for its help, shall be smitten with so much fear, that they shall in
   every direction run away. And this comparison ought to be carefully
   noticed, that is, when the Prophet compares powerful nations well
   exercised in wars, who before were audaciously raging, and were swollen
   with great pride -- when he compares them to worms and reptiles of the
   ground, and also to serpents: he did this to show, that there will be
   nothing to hinder God from laying prostrate every exalted thing in the
   world, as soon as it shall please him to aid his Church.

   And hence the Prophet adds, On account of Jehovah our God they shall
   treed, and they shall fear because of thee Here the Prophet shows, that
   the faithful ought not to distrust on account of their own weakness,
   but, on the contrary, to remember the infinite power of God. It is
   indeed right that the children of God should begin with diffidence, --
   sensible that they are nothing, and that all their strength is nothing;
   but they ought not to stop at their own weakness, but, on the contrary,
   to rise up to the contemplation of God's power, that they may not doubt
   but that, when his power shall appear, their enemies shall be soon
   scattered. This is the reason why the Prophet here mentions the name of
   God, and then turns to address God himself. Tremble then shall they at
   Jehovah our God, that is, on account of Jehovah our God; and then Fear
   shall they because of thee. [200] It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [198] "They shall be ashamed of the strength in which they trusted," --
   Drusius; or as Grotius says, "of all their strength which had been so
   suddenly destroyed;" or, as another author says, "of all their strength
   when found ineffectual for the purpose of destroying the people of
   God." -- Ed.

   [199] "Malice," says Jerome, "not only blinds the eyes, but also
   deafens the ears." -- Ed.

   [200] Dathius renders these two lines differently, "Jovam Deum nostrum
   timebunt eumque reverebuntur -- Jehovah our God they shall fear, and
   him will they reverence." But this is neither consistent with the
   passage, nor with the form in which the words appear. phchd is not
   commonly, if ever, a transitive verb, and to dread, or to be afraid,
   and not to fear, is its usual meaning: and yr', when it means the fear
   of reverence, is generally construed without a preposition, and with 't
   before Jehovah. The literal rendering is no doubt that which is given
   by Calvin. The distich is capable of being rendered in Welsh exactly as
   in Hebrew, in the same form and with the same prepositions; and, when
   thus rendered, the meaning is what is give here, -- Oherwydd Jehova ein
   Duw ur arswydant, --
   Ac ovnant rhagddot To fear because of thee, and to fear thee, are two
   distinct things. You will have the first form in Joshua 10:8; 11:6; and
   the second in Deuteronomy 31:12. The first refers to the fear of the
   Canaanites, the dread of their power; the second, to the fear of
   Jehovah. -- Ed.

   Micah 7:18

   18. Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth
   by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not
   his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy.

   18. Quis Deus sicut tu, tollens iniquitatem, et transiens super scelus,
   erga reliquias haereditatis suae? Non retinebit in perpetuum iram suam
   (alii vertunt, non roboravit; nam chzq hoc interdum significat; sed
   potius hic vertendum est, non retinebit;) quia placet ei clementia
   (vel, diligit misericordiam.) [201]


   The Prophet here exclaims that God ought to be glorified especially for
   this -- that he is merciful to his people. When he says, Who is God as
   thou art? he does not mean that there are other gods; for this,
   strictly speaking, is an improper comparison. But he shows that the
   true and only God may be distinguished from all idols by this
   circumstance -- that he graciously forgives the sins of his people and
   bears with their infirmities. It is indeed certain, that all nations
   entertained the opinion, that their gods were ready to pardon; hence
   their sacrifices and hence also their various kinds of expiations. Nor
   has there been any nation so barbarous as not to own themselves guilty
   in some measure before God; hence all the Gentiles were wont to apply
   to the mercy of their gods; while yet they had no firm conviction: for
   though they laid hold on this first principle, -- that the gods would
   be propitious to sinners, if they humbly sought pardon; yet they
   prayed, we know, with no sure confidence, for they had no certain
   promise. We hence see that what the Prophet means is this, -- that the
   God of Israel could be proved to be the true God from this circumstance
   -- that having once received into favor the children of Abraham, he
   continued to show the same favor, and kept his covenant inviolably,
   though their sins had been a thousand times a hindrance in the way.
   That God then in his goodness surmounted all the wickedness of the
   people, and stood firm in his covenant, which had been so often
   violated by vices of the people -- this fact may be brought as an
   evidence, that he is the true God: for what can be found of this kind
   among idols? Let us suppose that there is in them something divine,
   that they were gods, and endued with some power; yet with regard to the
   gods of the Gentiles, it could not be known that any one of them was
   propitious to his own people. Since then this can apply only to the God
   of Israel, it follows that in this instance his divinity shines
   conspicuously, and that his sovereignty is hence sufficiently proved.
   We also learn, that all the gods of heathens are vain; yea, that in the
   religion of heathens there is nothing but delusions: for no nation can
   with confidence flee to its god to obtain pardon, when it has sinned.
   This is the sum of the whole. I shall now come to the words of the
   Prophet.

   Who is a God like thee, taking away iniquity, and passing by
   wickedness? By these two forms of expression, he sets forth the
   singular favor of God in freely reconciling himself to sinners. To take
   away sins is to blot them out; though the verb ns', nusha,often means
   to raise on high; yet it means also to take, or, to take away. To pass
   by wickedness, is to connive at it, as though he said, "God overlooks
   the wickedness of his people, as if it escaped his view:" for when God
   requires an account of our life, our sins immediately appear, and
   appear before his eyes; but when God does not call our sins before his
   judgment, but overlooks them, he is then said to pass by them.

   This passage teaches us, as I have already reminded you, that the glory
   of God principally shines in this, -- that he is reconcilable, and that
   he forgives our sins. God indeed manifests his glory both by his power
   and his wisdom, and by all the judgments which he daily executes; his
   glory, at the same time, shines forth chiefly in this, -- that he is
   propitious to sinners, and suffers himself to be pacified; yea, that he
   not only allows miserable sinners to be reconciled to him, but that he
   also of his own will invites and anticipates them. Hence then it is
   evident, that he is the true God. That religion then may have firm
   roots in our hearts, this must be the first thing in our faith, -- that
   God will ever be reconciled to us; for except we be fully persuaded as
   to his mercy, no true religion will ever flourish in us, whatever
   pretensions we may make; for what is said in Psalm 130 is ever true,
   With thee is propitiation, that thou mayest be feared.' Hence the fear
   of God, and the true worship of him, depend on a perception of his
   goodness and favor; for we cannot from the heart worship God, and there
   will be, as I have already said, no genuine religion in us, except this
   persuasion be really and deeply seated in our hearts, -- that he is
   ever ready to forgive, whenever we flee to him.

   It hence also appears what sort of religion is that of the Papacy: for
   under the Papacy, being perplexed and doubtful, they ever hesitate, and
   never dare to believe that God will be propitious to them. Though they
   have some ideas, I know not what, of his grace; yet it is a vain
   presumption and rashness, as they think, when any one is fully
   persuaded of God's mercy. They therefore keep consciences in suspense;
   nay, they leave them doubtful and trembling, when there is no certainty
   respecting God's favor. It hence follows, that their whole worship is
   fictitious; in a word, the whole of religion is entirely subverted,
   when a firm and unhesitating confidence, as to his goodness, is taken
   away, yea, that confidence by which men are enabled to come to him
   without doubting, and to receive, whenever they sin and confess their
   guilt and transgressions, the mercy that is offered to them.

   But this confidence is not what rises spontaneously in us; nay, even
   when we entertain a notion that God is merciful, it is only a mere
   delusion: for we cannot be fully convinced respecting God's favor,
   except he anticipates us by his word, and testifies that he will be
   propitious to us whenever we flee to him. Hence I said at the
   beginning, that the Prophet here exhibits the difference between the
   God of Israel and all the idols of the Gentiles, and that is, because
   he had promised to be propitious to his people. It was not in vain that
   sacrifices were offered by the chosen people, for there was a promise
   added, which could not disappoint them: but the Gentiles ever remained
   doubtful with regard to their sacrifices; though they performed all
   their expiations, there was yet no certainty; but the case was
   different with the chosen people. What then the Prophet says here
   respecting the remission of sins, depends on the testimony which God
   himself has given.

   We must now notice the clause which immediately follows, as to the
   remnant of his heritage Here again he drives away the hypocrites from
   their vain confidence: for he says that God will be merciful only to a
   remnant of his people; and, at the same time, he takes away an offense,
   which might have grievously disquieted the weak, on seeing the wrath of
   God raging among the whole people, -- that God would spare neither the
   common nor the chief men. When therefore the fire of God's vengeance
   flamed terribly, above and below, this objection might have greatly
   disturbed weak minds, -- "How is this? God does indeed declare that he
   is propitious to sinners, and yet his severity prevails among us. --
   How can this be?" The Prophet meets this objection and says, God is
   propitious to the remnant of his heritage; which means, that though God
   would execute terrible vengeance on the greater part, there would yet
   ever remain some seed, on whom his mercy would shine; and he calls them
   the remnant of his heritage, because there was no reason, as it was
   stated yesterday, why God forgave the few, except that he had chosen
   the posterity of Abraham.

   He also adds, He will not retain his wrath perpetually. By this second
   consolation he wished to relieve the faithful: for though God chastises
   them for a time, he yet forgets not his mercy. We may say, that the
   Prophet mentions here two exceptions. He had spoken of God's mercy; but
   as this mercy is not indiscriminate or common to all, he restricts what
   he teaches to the remnant. Now follows another exception, -- that how
   much soever apparently the wrath of God would rage against his elect
   people themselves, there would yet be some moderation, so that they
   would remain safe, and that their calamities would not be to them
   fatal. Hence he says, God retains not wrath; for though, for a moment,
   he may be angry with his people, he will yet soon, as it were, repent,
   and show himself gracious to them, and testify that he is already
   reconciled to them; -- not that God changes, but that the faithful are
   made for a short time to feel his wrath; afterwards a taste of his
   mercy exhilarates them, and thus they feel in their souls that God has
   in a manner changed. For when dread possesses their minds, they imagine
   God to be terrible, but when they embrace the promises of his grace,
   they call on him, and begin to entertain hope of pardon; then God
   appears to them kind, gentle, and reconcilable; yea, and altogether
   ready to show mercy. This is the reason why the Prophet says, that God
   retains not his wrath

   Then follows the cause, for he loveth mercy Here the Prophet more
   clearly shows, that the remission of sins is gratuitous, and that it
   has no foundation but in the nature of God himself. There is then no
   reason, since Scripture declares God to be reconcilable, why any one
   should seek the cause in himself, or even the means by which God
   reconciles himself to us: for He himself is the cause. As God then by
   nature loves mercy, hence it is, that he is so ready to forgive
   sinners. Whosoever then imagines that God is to be propitiated by
   expiations or any satisfactions, subverts the doctrine of the Prophet;
   and it is the same thing as to build without a foundation: for the only
   prop or support that can raise us up to God, when we desire to be
   reconciled to him, is this, -- that he loves mercy. And this is the
   reason why God so much commends his mercy, why he says that he is
   merciful to thousand generations, slow to wrath, and ready to pardon.
   For though the unbelieving harden themselves against God, yet when they
   feel his wrath, there is nothing so difficult for them as to believe
   that God can be pacified. Hence this reason, which is not in vain added
   by the Prophet, ought to be especially noticed.

   Let us now see to whom God is merciful. For as Satan could not have
   obliterated from the hearts of men a conviction of God's mercy, he has
   yet confined mercy to the unbelieving, as though God should forgive
   sinners only once, when they are admitted into the Church. Thus the
   Pelagians formerly thought, that God grants reconciliation to none but
   to aliens; for whosoever has been once received into the Church cannot,
   as they imagined, stand otherwise before God than by being perfect. And
   this figment led Novatus and his disciples to create disturbances in
   the Church. And there are at this day not only deluded men, but devils,
   who, by the same figment, or rather delirious notions, fascinate
   themselves and others, and hold, that the highest perfection ought to
   exist in the faithful; and they also slander our doctrine, as though we
   were still continuing in the Alphabet or in the first rudiments,
   because we daily preach free remission of sins. But the Prophet
   declares expressly that God not only forgives the unbelieving when they
   sin, but also his heritage and his elect. Let us then know, that as
   long as we are in the world, pardon is prepared for us, as we could not
   otherwise but fall every moment from the hope of salvation, were not
   this remedy provided for us: for those men must be more than mad who
   arrogate to themselves perfection, or who think that they have arrived
   at that high degree of attainment, that they can satisfy God by their
   works. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [201] Cocceius calls this verse the doxology of the Church. Jerome
   renders the first words, -- Quis Deus similis tui? Which is literally
   the original, kmvk my-'l-- What God like thee? That is, Jehovah,
   mentioned in the preceding verse. Tis Theos osper su; Sept. Thinking
   that the verse will admit of somewhat different arrangement, and of a
   more literal rendering, I give the following, -- What God is like thee?
   Taking away iniquity, and passing over transgression! --
   Against the remnant of his heritage,
   He retaineth not for ever his anger,
   For a lover of mercy is He. There is a transition after the second line
   from the second to the third person; hence I make here the division.
   Besides, the construction of the third with the second has ever been
   found awkward by all the critics; but its construction with the fourth
   verse is perfectly natural. ns' "taking away," or removing, conveys the
   idea of a burden being lifted up and removed. "Passing over" seems to
   allude to the angel passing over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt.
   "Iniquity," vn, is guilt and inward depravity; and "Transgression,"
   phs, is an overt act of sin, an outward violation of the law. "A
   lover," chphph; the Septuagint renders it, theletes eleous -- the
   wisher of mercy; which is too weak, for the word means delight. It may
   be rendered, "For one who delights in mercy is He." The Targum reads,
   Amat enim benefacere -- for he loves to do good. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Micah 7:19

   19. He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue
   our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of
   the sea.

   19. Reveretur, miserebitur nostri; calcabit iniquitates nostras, et
   projiciet in profunditates maris cuncta scelera eorum.


   The Prophet now prescribes to the faithful a form of glorying, that
   they may boldly declare that God will be pacified towards them. Since
   then God loves mercy, he will return, he will have mercy on us The
   context here ought to be observed by us; for it would avail us but
   little to understand, I know not what, concerning God's mercy, and to
   preach in general the free remission of sins, except we come to the
   application, that is, except each of the faithful believed that God,
   for his own sake, is merciful, as soon as he is called upon. This
   conclusion, then, is to be borne in mind, -- "God forgives the remnant
   of his heritage, because he is by nature inclined to show mercy: he
   will therefore be merciful to us, for we are of the number of his
   people." Except we lay hold on this conclusion, "He will therefore show
   mercy to us," whatever we have heard or said respecting God's goodness
   will vanish away.

   This then is the true logic of religion, that is, when we are persuaded
   that God is reconcilable and easily pacified, because he is by nature
   inclined to mercy, and also, when we thus apply this doctrine to
   ourselves, or to our own peculiar benefit, -- As God is by nature
   merciful, I shall therefore know and find him to be so. Until then we
   be thus persuaded, let us know that we have made but little progress in
   the school of God. And hence it appears very clear from this passage,
   that the Papacy is a horrible abyss; for no one under that system can
   have a firm footing, so as to be fully persuaded that God will be
   merciful to him; for all that they have are mere conjectures. But we
   see that the Prophet reasons very differently, God loves mercy; he will
   therefore have mercy on us: and then he adds, He will return; [202] and
   this is said lest the temporary wrath or severity of God should
   disquiet us. Though God then may not immediately shine on us with his
   favor, but, on the contrary, treat us sharply and roughly, yet the
   Prophet teaches us that we are to entertain good hope. -- How so? He
   will return, or, as he said shortly before, He will not retain
   perpetually his wrath: for it is for a moment that he is angry with his
   Church; and he soon remembers mercy.

   The Prophet now specifies what sort of mercy God shows to the faithful,
   For he will tread down our iniquities; he had said before that he
   passes by the wickedness of his elect people. He will then tread down
   our iniquities; and he will cast [203] into the depth of the sea all
   their sins; that is our sins shall not come in remembrance before him.
   We hence learn what I have said before -- that God cannot be worshipped
   sincerely and from the heart until this conviction be fixed and deeply
   rooted in our hearts, that God is merciful, not in general, but toward
   us, because we have been once adopted by him and are his heritage. And
   then were the greater part to fall away, we should not fail in our
   faith; for God preserves the remnant in a wonderful manner. And lastly,
   let us know, that whenever we flee to God for mercy, pardon is ever
   ready for us, not that we may indulge in sin, or take liberty to commit
   it, but that we may confess our faults and that our guilt may appear
   before our eyes: let us know, that the door is open to us; for God of
   his own good will presents himself to us as one ready to be reconciled.

   It is also said, He will cast our sins into the depth of the sea. We
   hence learn that there is a full remission of sins, not half as the
   Papists imagine, for God, they say, remits the sin, but retains the
   punishment. How frivolous this is, the thing itself clearly proves. The
   language of the Prophet does however import this, that our sins are
   then remitted when the records of them are blotted out before God. It
   follows -- for I will run over this verse, that I may today finish this
   Prophet --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [202] Grotius, Dathius, and Henderson, consider that this verb, placed
   before another, without a conjunction, expresses only a reiteration;
   and they render it adverbially, "again." But, in this place, it would
   be better to give it its proper meaning; for as God is said to depart
   from his people, Hosea 9:12, so he may be said also to return. The
   Septuagint renders it epistrepsei--He will return. Drusius reads,
   convertetur, scil. Ab ira sua -- He will turn, that is, from his anger.
   Newcome's version is, "He will turn again." -- Ed.

   [203] There is a mistake as to this verb; it is the second person, as
   are all the verbs which follow. The Prophet resumes here his address to
   God, which he commenced in the two first lines of the last verse. To
   show the difference between what he speaks to and what he speaks of
   God, the whole passage shall be here given, -- 18. What God is like
   thee!
   Taking away iniquity, and passing over transgression!
   Against the remnant of his heritage
   He retains not forever his anger;
   For a lover of mercy is He; 19. He will return, he will pity us,
   He will subdue our iniquities: --
   Yea, thou wilt cast into the depths of the sea all their sins;
   Thou wilt show faithfulness to Jacob, mercy to Abraham,
   Which thou swarest to our fathers in the days of old. "Pity," rtchm, is
   tender compassion; the noun in the plural number is used to designate
   the bowels. "Subdue," or trample under foot, is rendered "cover" by
   Newcome, on the ground of this being the meaning of kvs in Chaldee.
   This wholly destroys the striking character of the passage. Our sins
   are here represented as our enemies; God subdues them; and then in the
   next line the simile is continued, they are to be drowned like Pharaoh
   and his hosts in the depths of the sea. Henderson's remarks on this
   point are very excellent. "There is no ground," he says, "for rejecting
   the radical idea of trampling under foot as enemies. Sin must ever be
   regarded as hostile to man. It is not only contrary to his interests,
   but it powerfully opposes and combats the moral principles of his
   nature, and the higher principles implanted by grace; and but for the
   counteracting energy of divine influence, must prove victorious.
   Without the subjugation of evil propensities, pardon would not be a
   blessing." -- Ed.

   Micah 7:20

   20. Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham,
   which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.

   20. Dabis veritatem Jacob, misericordiam Abrahae, quas jurasti patribus
   nostris a diebus antiquis.


   The faithful confirm here the former truth, that God had deposited his
   covenant with them, which could not be made void: and hence also shines
   forth more clearly what I have said before, that the faithful do not
   learn by their own understanding what sort of Being God is, but embrace
   the mercy which he offers in his own word. Except God then speaks, we
   cannot form in our own minds any idea of his grace but what is
   uncertain and vanishing; but when he declares that he will be merciful
   to us, then every doubt is removed. This is now the course which the
   Prophet pursues.

   He says, Thou wilt give truth to Jacob, mercy to Abraham, which thou
   hast sworn to our fathers; as though he said, "We do not presumptuously
   invent any thing out of our own minds, but receive what thou hast once
   testified to us; for thy will has been made known to us in thy word:
   relying then on thy favor, we are persuaded as to thy gratuitous
   pardon, though we are in many respects guilty before thee." We now then
   understand the design of the Prophet.

   As to the words, it is not necessary to dwell on them, for we have
   elsewhere explained this form of speaking. There are here two
   expressions by which the Prophet characterizes the covenant of God.
   Truth is mentioned, and mercy is mentioned. With respect to order, the
   mercy of God precedes; for he is not induced otherwise to adopt us than
   through his goodness alone: but as God of his own will has with so
   great kindness received us, so he is true and faithful in his covenant.
   If then we desire to know the character of God's covenant, by which he
   formerly chose the Jews, and at this day adopts us as his people, these
   two things must be understood, that God freely offers himself to us,
   and that he is constant and true, he repents not, as Paul says, as to
   his covenant: The gifts and calling of God, he says, are without
   repentance, (Romans 11:29;) and he refers to the covenant, by which God
   adopted the children of Abraham.

   He says now, Thou wilt give, that is, show in reality; for this, to
   give, is, as it were, to exhibit in effect or really. Thou will then
   give, that is, openly show, that thou hast not been in vain so kind to
   us and ours, in receiving them into favor. How so? Because the effect
   of thy goodness and truth appears to us.

   Thou hast then sworn to our fathers from the days of old. The faithful
   take for granted that God had promised to the fathers that his covenant
   would be perpetual; for he did not only say to Abraham, I will be thy
   God, but he also added, and of thy seed for ever. Since, then, the
   faithful knew that the covenant of God was to be perpetual and
   inviolable, and also knew that it was to be continued from the fathers
   to their children, and that it was once promulgated for this end, that
   the fathers might deliver it as by the hand to their children; they
   therefore doubted not but that it would be perpetual. How so? for thou
   hast sworn to our fathers; that is, they knew that God not only
   promised, but that having interposed an oath, by which God designed to
   confirm that covenant, he greatly honored it, that it might be
   unhesitatingly received by the chosen people. As then the faithful knew
   that God in a manner bound himself to them, they confidently solicited
   him, really to show himself to be such as he had declared he would be
   to his own elect.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as we abound in so many vices, by which we
   daily provoke thy wrath, and as by the testimony of our consciences, we
   are justly exposed to everlasting death, yea, and deserve a hundred and
   even a thousand deaths, -- O grant, that we may strive against the
   unbelief of our flesh, and so embrace thine infinite mercy, that we may
   not doubt but that thee wilt be propitious to us, and yet not abuse
   this privilege by taking liberty to sin, but with fear, and true
   humility, and care, so walk according to thy word, that we may not
   hesitate daily to flee to thy mercy, that we may thereby be sustained
   and kept in safety, until having at length put off all vices, and being
   freed from all sin, we come to thy celestial kingdom, to enjoy the
   fruit of our faith, even that eternal inheritance which has been
   obtained for us by the blood of thy only-begotten Son. Amen.

   Calvin's Preface to Nahum

   The time in which Nahum prophesied cannot with certainty be known. The
   Hebrews, ever bold in conjectures, say that he discharged his office of
   teaching under Manasseh, and that the name of that king was suppressed,
   because he was unworthy of such an honor, or, because his reign was
   unfortunate, as he had been led into captivity. When any one asks the
   Jews a reason, they only say, that it appears so to them. As then there
   is no reason for this conjecture, we must come to what seems probable.

   They who think that he prophesied under Jotham are no doubt mistaken,
   and can easily be disproved; for he here threatens ruin to the city
   Nineveh because the Assyrians had cruelly laid waste the kingdom of
   Israel; and it is for these wrongs that he denounces vengeance: but
   under Jotham the kingdom of Israel had not been laid waste. We indeed
   know that the Assyrians were suborned by Ahab, when he found himself
   unequal to resist the attacks of two neighboring kings, the king of
   Syria, and the king of Israel. It was then that the Assyrians
   penetrated into the land of Israel, and in course of time, they
   desolated the whole kingdom. At this period it was that Nahum
   prophesied; for it was his object to show, that God had a care for that
   kingdom, on account of his adoption or covenant; though the Israelites
   had perfidiously separated themselves from the people of God, yet God's
   covenant remained in force. His design then was to show, that God was
   the father and protector of that kingdom. As this was the Prophet's
   object, it is certain that he taught either after the death of Ahab
   under Hezekiah, or about that time. [204]

   He followed Jonah at some distance, [205] as we may easily learn.
   Jonah, as we have already seen, pronounced a threatening on the city
   Nineveh; but the punishment was remitted, because the Ninevites humbled
   themselves, and suppliantly deprecated the punishment which had been
   announced. They afterwards returned to their old ways, as it is usually
   the case. Hence it was, that God became less disposed to spare them.
   Though indeed they were aliens, yet God was pleased to show them favor
   by teaching them through the ministry and labors of Jonah: and their
   repentance was not altogether feigned. Since then they were already
   endued with some knowledge of the true God, the less excusable was
   their cruelty, when they sought to oppress the kingdom of Israel. They
   indeed knew, that that nation was sacred to God: what they did then was
   in a manner an outrage against God himself.

   We now understand at what time it is probable that Nahum performed his
   office as a teacher; though nothing certain, as I have said at the
   beginning, can be known: hence it was, that I condemned the Rabbis for
   rashness on the subject; for they are bold enough to bring any thing
   forward as a truth, respecting which there is no certainty.

   I have already in part stated the design of the Prophet. The sum of the
   whole is this: When the Assyrians had for some time disturbed the
   kingdom of Israel, the Prophet arose and exhorted the Israelites to
   patience, that is, those who continued to be the servants of God;
   because God had not wholly forsaken them, but would undertake their
   cause, for they were under his protection. This is the substance of the
   whole.

   With regard to Nineveh, we have already stated that it was the capital
   of the empire, as long as the Assyrians did bear rule: for Babylon was
   a province; that is, Chaldea, whose metropolis was Babylon, was one of
   the provinces of the empire. The kingdom was afterwards taken away from
   Meroc-baladan. Some think that Nabuchodonosor was the first monarch of
   Chaldea. But I bestow no great pains on this subject. It may be, that
   Meroc-baladan had two names, and this was very common; as we know that
   the kings of Egypt were called Pharaohs; so the Assyrians and
   Chaldeans, though otherwise called at first, might have taken a common
   royal name. Now Nineveh was so celebrated, that another kingdom could
   not have been established by the Babylonians without demolishing that
   city. We indeed know that it was very large, as we have stated in
   explaining Jonah. It was, as profane writers have recorded, nearly
   three days' journey in circumference. Then its walls were one hundred
   feet high, and so wide, that chariots could pass one another without
   coming in contact: there were one thousand and five hundred towers. We
   hence see that it was not without reason that this city was formerly so
   celebrated.

   They say that Ninus was its founder, but this is proved to be a mistake
   by the testimony of Moses in Genesis 10. They also imagine that
   emiramis was the first queen of Babylon, and that the city was built by
   her: but this is a fable. It may have been that she enlarged the city;
   but it was Babylon many ages before she was born. So also Ninus may
   have increased and adorned Nineveh; but the city was founded before his
   birth. Profane authors call it Ninus, not Nineveh; probably the Hebrew
   name was corrupted by them, as it is often the case. However this may
   be, it is evident, that when Meroc-baladan, or his son, who succeeded
   him, wished to fix the seat of the empire at Babylon, he was under the
   necessity of destroying Nineveh to prevent rivalry. It thus happened,
   that the city was entirely demolished. Of this destruction, as we shall
   see, Nahum prophesied.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [204] "I conclude from Nahum 2:2, that Nahum prophesied after the
   captivity of the ten tribes. Josephus places him in the reign of
   Jotham, and says that his predictions came to pass one hundred and
   fifteen hears afterwards. Ant. IX. 11. 3. According to our best
   chronologers, this date would bring us to the year in which Samaria was
   taken. And I agree with those who think Nahum uttered this prophecy in
   the reign of Hezekiah, and not long after the subversion of the kingdom
   of Israel by Shalmaneser." -- Newcome.

   [205] The distance is supposed by chronologers to have been about 150
   years. -- Ed.

   Nahum 1:1

   1.. The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the
   Elkoshite.

   1. Onus Nineveh: Liber visionis Nahum Helkosi:


   Though a part of what is here delivered belongs to the Israelites and
   to the Jews, he yet calls his Book by what it principally contains; he
   calls its the burden of Nineveh Of this word ms', mesha, we have spoken
   elsewhere. Thus the Prophets call their prediction, whenever they
   denounce any grievous and dreadful vengeance of God: and as they often
   threatened the Jews, it hence happened, that they called, by way of
   ridicule, all prophecies by this name ms', mesha, a burden. [206] But
   yet the import of the word is suitable. It is the same thing as though
   Nahum had said that he was sent by God as a herald, to proclaim war on
   the Ninevites for the sake of the chosen people. The Israelites may
   have hence learnt how true and unchangeable God was in his covenant;
   for he still manifested his care for them, though they had by their
   vices alienated themselves from him.

   He afterwards adds, sphr chzvn, sapher chezun, the book of the vision
   This clause signifies, that he did not in vain denounce destruction on
   the Ninevites, because he faithfully delivered what he had received
   from God. For if he had simply prefaced, that he threatened ruin to the
   Assyrian,, some doubt might have been entertained as to the event. But
   here he seeks to gain to himself authority by referring to God's name;
   for he openly affirms that he brought nothing of his own, but that this
   burden had been made known to him by a celestial oracle: for chzh,
   cheze, means properly to see, and hence in Hebrew a vision is called
   chzvn, chezun,. But the Prophets, when they speak of a vision, do not
   mean any fantasy or imagination, but that kind of revelation which is
   mentioned in Numbers 14, where God says, that he speaks to his Prophets
   either by vision or by dream. We hence see why this was added -- that
   the burden of Nineveh was a vision; it was, that the Israelites might
   know that this testimony respecting God's vengeance on their enemies
   was not brought by a mortal man, and that there might be no doubt but
   that God was the author of this prophecy.

   Nahum calls himself an Elkoshite. Some think that it was the name of
   his family. The Jews, after their manner, say, that it was the name of
   his father; and then they add this their common gloss, that Elkos
   himself was a Prophet: for when the name of a Prophet's father is
   mentioned, they hold that he whose name is given was also a Prophet.
   But these are mere trifles: and we have often seen how great is their
   readiness to invent fables. Then the termination of the word leads us
   to think that it was, on the contrary, the proper name of a place; and
   Jerome tells us that there was in his time a small village of this name
   in the tribe of Simon. We must therefore understand, that Nahum arose
   from that town, and was therefore called "the Elkoshite." [207] Let us
   now proceed --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [206] The word comes from ns', to bear, to carry. Some regard it as the
   message carried or borne by the Prophets from God to the people, and
   hence the same as Prophecy. Others consider it to be the judgment to be
   borne by the people respecting whom it was announced. The latter seems
   to be its meaning here, where it is said, "the burden of Nineveh." It
   was the judgment laid on them, and which that city was to bear, endure,
   and undergo. -- Ed.

   [207] "It has been thought, and not without reason, by some, that
   Capernaum, Heb. kphd nchvm, most properly rendered, the village of
   Nahum, derived its name from our Prophet having resided in it." --
   Henderson.

   Nahum 1:2

   2. God is jealous, and the Lord revengeth; the Lord revengeth, and is
   furious; the Lord will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he
   reserveth wrath for his enemies.

   2. Deus aemulator (sic vertunt,) et ulciscens Jehova; ulciscens Jehova,
   et Dominus irae (vel, possidens iram;) ulciscens Jehova hostes suos, et
   servans (vel, responens) idem (vel, ipse) inimicis suis.


   Nahum begins with the nature of God, that what he afterwards subjoins
   respecting the destruction of Nineveh might be more weighty, and
   produce a greater impression on the hearers. The preface is general,
   but the Prophet afterwards applies it to a special purpose. If he had
   only spoken of what God is, it would have been frigid at least it would
   have been less efficacious; but when he connects both together, then
   his doctrine carries its own force and power. We now apprehend the
   design of the Prophet. He might indeed have spoken of the fall of the
   city Nineveh: but if he had referred to this abruptly, profane men
   might have regarded him with disdain; and even the Israelites would
   have been perhaps less affected. This is the reason why he shows, in a
   general way, what sort of Being God is. And he takes his words from
   Moses; and the Prophets are wont to borrow from him their doctrine:
   [208] and it is from that most memorable vision, when God appeared to
   Moses after the breaking of the tables. I have therefore no doubt but
   that Nahum had taken from Exodus 34 what we read here: he does not,
   indeed, give literally what is found there; but it is sufficiently
   evident that he paints, as it were, to the life, the image of God, by
   which his nature may be seen.

   He says first, that God is jealous; (amulus -- emulous); for the verb
   qn', kona, means to irritate, and also to emulate, and to envy. When
   God is said to be qnv', konua, the Greeks render it jealous, zeloten,
   and the Latins, emulous, (amulatorem) But it properly signifies, that
   God cannot bear injuries or wrongs. Though God then for a time connives
   at the wickedness of men? he will yet be the defender of his own glory.
   He calls him afterwards the avenger, and he repeats this three times,
   Jehovah avengeth, Jehovah avengeth and possesseth wrath, he will
   avenge. When he says that God keeps for his enemies, he means that
   vengeance is reserved for the unbelieving and the despisers of God.
   There is the same mode of speaking in use among us, Je lui garde, et il
   la garde a ses ennemis. This phrase, in our language, shows what the
   Prophet means here by saying, that God keeps for his enemies. And this
   awful description of God is to be applied to the present case, for he
   says that he proclaims war against the Ninevites, because they had
   unjustly distressed the Church of God: it is for this reason that he
   says, that God is jealous, that God is an avenger; and he confirms this
   three times, that the Israelites might feel assured that this calamity
   was seriously announced; for had not this representation been set
   before them, they might have thus reasoned with themselves, -- "We are
   indeed cruelly harassed by our enemies; but who can think that God
   cares any thing for our miseries, since he allows them so long to be
   unavenged?" It was therefore necessary that the Prophet should obviate
   such thoughts, as he does here. We now more fully understand why he
   begins in a language so vehement, and calls God a jealous God, and an
   avenger.

   He afterwards adds, that God possesses wrath I do not take chmh, cheme,
   simply for wrath, but the passion or he it of wrath. We ought not
   indeed to suppose, as it has been often observed, that our passions
   belong to God; for he remains ever like himself. But yet God is said to
   be for a time angry, and for ever towards the reprobate, for he is our
   and their Judge. Here, then, when the Prophet says, that God is the
   Lord of wrath, or that he possesses wrath, he means that he is armed
   with vengeance and that, though he connives at the sins of men, he is
   not yet indifferent, nor even delays because he is without power, or
   because he is idle and careless, but that he retains wraths as he
   afterwards repeats the same thing, He keeps for his enemies [209] In
   short, by these forms of speaking the Prophet intimates that God is not
   to be rashly judged of on account of his delay, when he does not
   immediately execute His judgments; for he waits for the seasonable
   opportunity. But, in the meantime there is no reason for us to think
   that he forgets his office when he suspends punishment, or for a season
   spares the ungodly. When, therefore, God does not hasten so very
   quickly, there is no ground for us to think that he is indifferent,
   because he delays his wrath, or retains it, as we have already said;
   for it is the same thing to retain wrath, as to be the Lord of wrath,
   and to possess it. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [208] How far this language is right, may be questioned. The Prophets,
   under the immediate direction of the Divine Spirit, can hardly be said
   to borrow from a previous writer. They have no doubt announced the same
   sentiments, and in some instances, used the same words, as those found
   in the writings of Moses; but they derived them not from those
   writings, but from Divine inspiration: and, as Calvin has often
   observed, they adduced nothing but what they received from God. But
   this language is not peculiar to Calvin: he adopted it from the
   fathers. -- Ed.

   [209] The following may be proposed as the literal rendering of this
   verse, -- A God jealous and an avenger is Jehovah;
   Avenger is Jehovah, and one who has indignation:
   Avenger is Jehovah on his adversaries,
   And watch does he for his enemies. God is said to be jealous in the
   second commandment, being one who will not allow his own honor to be
   given to another. Avenger, nqm, is a vindicator of his own rights; and
   he is said to have indignation, or hot wrath, or great displeasure; vl
   chmh, possessor, holder, or keeper of indignation. His adversaries,
   tsryv, rather, his oppressors; the oppressors of his people were his
   own oppressors. nvtr means to watch, rather than to keep. Its meaning
   here is to watch the opportunity to take than to keep. Its meaning here
   is to watch the opportunity to take vengeance on his enemies. The
   description here is remarkable, and exactly adapted to the oppressive
   state of the Jews. The dishonor done to God's people was done to him.
   He is jealous, a defender of his own rights, full of indignation, and
   watches and waits for a suitable time to execute vengeance, to
   vindicate his own honor. -- Ed.

   Nahum 1:3

   3. The Lord is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all
   acquit the wicked: the Lord hath his way in the whirlwind and in the
   storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.

   3. Jehova tardus iris (ad verbum, sed, tardus ad iram) et magnus
   robore; et purgando non purgabit; Jehova in turbine et tempestate via
   ejus, et nubes pulvis pedum ejus.


   The Prophet goes on with the same subject; and still longer is the
   preface respecting the nature of God, which however is to be applied,
   as I have said, to the special objects which hereafter he will state.
   He says here that God is slow to wrath Though this saying is taken also
   from Moses yet the Prophet speaks here for the purpose of anticipating
   an objection; for he obviates the audacity of the ungodly who daringly
   derided God, when any evil was denounced on them, -- Where is the mercy
   of God? Can God divest himself of his kindness? He cannot deny himself.
   Thus profane men, under the pretense of honoring God, cast on him the
   most atrocious slander, for they deprive him of his own power and
   office: and there is no doubt but that this was commonly done by many
   of the ungodly in the age of our Prophet. Hence he anticipates this
   objection, and concedes that God is slow to wrath. There is then a
   concession here; but at the same time he says that God is great in
   strength, and this he says, that the ungodly may not flatter and
   deceive themselves, when they hear these high attributes given to God,
   that he is patient, slow to wrath, merciful, full of kindness. "Let
   them," he says, "at the same time remember the greatness of God's
   power, that they may not think that they have to do with a child."

   We now then see the design of the Prophet: for this declaration -- that
   God hastens not suddenly to wrath, but patiently defers and suspends
   the punishment which the ungodly deserve. This declaration would not
   have harmonized with the present argument, had not the Prophet
   introduced it by way of concession; as though he said, -- "I see that
   the world everywhere trifle with God, and that the ungodly delude
   themselves with such Sophistries, that they reject all threatening. I
   indeed allow that God is ready to pardon, and that he descends not to
   wrath, except when he is constrained by extreme necessity: all this is
   indeed true; but yet know, that God is armed with his own power: escape
   then shall none of those who allow themselves the liberty of abusing
   his patience, notwithstanding the insolence they manifest towards him."

   He now adds, By clearing he will not clear. Some translate, "The
   innocent, he will not render innocent." But the real meaning of this
   sentence is the same with that in Exodus 34; and what Moses meant was,
   that God is irreconcilable to the impenitent. It has another meaning at
   the end of Joel 3, where it is said, I will cleanse the blood which I
   have not cleansed.' On that text interpreters differ; because they
   regard not the change in the tense of the verb; for God means, that he
   would cleanse the filth and defilements of his Church, which he had not
   previously cleansed. But Moses means, that God deals strictly with
   sinners, so as to remit no punishment. By clearing then I will not
   clear; that is, God will rigidly demand an account of all the actions
   of men; and as there is nothing hid from him, so everything done
   wickedly by men must come forth, when God ascends his tribunal; he will
   not clear by clearing, but will rigidly execute his judgment.

   There seems to be some inconsistency in saying, -- that God is
   reconcilable and ready to pardon, -- and yet that by clearing he will
   not clear. But the aspect of things is different. We have already
   stated what the Prophet had in view: for inasmuch as the ungodly ever
   promise impunity to themselves, and in this confidence petulantly
   deride God himself, the Prophet answers them, and declares, that there
   was no reason why they thus abused God's forbearance, for he says, By
   clearing he will not clear, that is, the reprobate: for our salvation
   consists in a free remission of sins; and whence comes our
   righteousness, but from the imputation of God, and from this -- that
   our sins are buried in oblivion? yea, our whole clearing depends on the
   mercy of God. But God then exercises also his judgment, and by clearing
   he clears, when he remits to the faithful their sins; for the faithful
   by repentance anticipate his judgment; and he searches their hearts,
   that he may clear them. For what is repentance but condemnation, which
   yet turns out to be the means of salvation? As then God absolves none
   except the condemned, our Prophet here rightly declares, that by
   clearing he will not clears that is, he will not remit their sins,
   except he tries them and discharges the office of a judge; in short,
   that no sin is remitted by God which he does not first condemn. But
   with regard to the reprobate, who are wholly obstinate in their
   wickedness, the Prophet justly declares this to them, -- that they have
   no hope of pardon, as they perversely adhere to their own devices, and
   think that they can escape the hand of God: the Prophet tells them that
   they are deceived, for God passes by nothing, and will not blot out one
   sin, until all be brought to mind.

   He afterwards says, that the way of God is in the whirlwind and the
   tempest; that is, that God, as soon as he shows himself, disturbs the
   whole atmosphere, and excites storms and tempests: and this must be
   applied to the subject in hand; for the appearance of God is in other
   places described as lovely and gracious: nay, what else but the sight
   of God exhilarated the faithful? As soon as God turns away his face,
   they must necessarily be immersed in dreadful darkness, and be
   surrounded with horrible terrors. Why then does the Prophet say here,
   that the way of God is in the whirlwind and storms? Even because his
   discourse is addressed to the ungodly, or to the despisers of God
   himself, as in Psalm 18; where we see him described as being very
   terrible, -- that clouds and darkness are around him, that he moves the
   whole earth, that he thunders on every side, that he emits smoke frown
   his nostrils, and that he fills the whole world with fire and burning.
   For what purpose was this done? Because David's object was to set forth
   the judgments of God, which he had executed on the ungodly. So it is in
   this place; for Nahum speaks of the future vengeance, which was then
   nigh the Assyrians; hence he says, The way of God is in the whirlwind
   and tempest; that is, when God goes forth, whirlwinds and tempests are
   excited by his presence, and the whole world is put in confusion.

   He adds, that the clouds are the dust of his feet When any one with his
   feet only moves the dust within a small space, some dread is produced:
   but God moves the dust, not only in one place, -- what then? he
   obscures, and thus covers the whole heaven, The clouds then are the
   dust of his feet [210] We now apprehend the whole meaning of the
   Prophet, and the purpose for which this description is given. Of the
   same import is what follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [210] I offer the following translation of this verse, -- Jehovah is
   slow to wrath, though great in power;
   Absolving, Jehovah will not absolve:
   In the whirlwind and in the storm is his way;
   And the cloud is the dust of his feet. The second line presents some
   difficulty. It is evidently an imperfect sentence; most supply the
   word, guilty; but rather the "enemies" mentioned before are to be
   understood. The meaning appears to be this, -- Jehovah is slow to
   wrath, that is, to execute his vengeance, though he is great in power,
   capable of doing so; but though he delays, he will not eventually clear
   or absolve his enemies. With the Septuagint I connect "Jehovah" with
   the second and not with the third line, and agreeably with the idiom of
   the Hebrew; the verb generally precedes its nominative. The order of
   the words in Welsh would be exactly the same, -- Gan ddieuogi ni
   ddiuoga Jehova. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Nahum 1:4

   4. He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the
   rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon
   languisheth.

   4. Increpat mare et arefaciet illud (hoc est, simulac mare increpuerit,
   arefaciet;) et omnia flumina exiccat, infirmatur (vel aboletur) Basan
   et Carmelus, et germen Libani aboletur (vel, infirmatur, est idem
   verbum.)


   Nahum continues his discourse, -- that God, in giving proof of his
   displeasure, would disturb the sea or make it dry. There may be here an
   allusion to the history, described by Moses; for the Prophets, in
   promising God's assistance to his people, often remind them how God in
   a miraculous manner brought up their fathers from Egypt. As then the
   passage through the Red Sea was in high repute among the Jews, it may
   be that the Prophet alluded to that event, (Exodus 14:22.) But another
   view seems to me more probable. We indeed know how impetuous an element
   is that of the sea; and hence in Jeremiah 5, God, intending to set
   forth his own power, says, that it is in his power to calm the raging
   of the sea, than which nothing is more impetuous or more violent. In
   the same manner also is the majesty of God described in Job 28. The
   meaning of this place, I think, is the same, -- that God by his chiding
   makes the sea dry, [211] and that he can dry up the rivers That the
   prophet connects rivers with the sea, confirms what I have just said,
   -- that the passage through the Red Sea is not here referred to; but
   that the object is to show in general how great is God's power in
   governing the whole world.

   To the same purpose is what he adds, Bashan shall be weakened, and
   Carmel, and the branch of Lebanon shall be weakened, or destroyed. By
   these words he intimates, that there is nothing so magnificent in the
   world, which God changes not, when he gives proofs of his displeasure;
   as it is said in Psalm 104,

   Send forth thy Spirit, and they shall be renewed;'

   and again, Take away thy Spirit,' or remove it, and all things will
   return to the dust;' yea, into nothing. So also Nahum says in this
   place, "As soon as God shows his wrath, the rivers will dry up, the sea
   itself will become dry, and then the flowers will fade and the grass
   will wither;" that is, though the earth be wonderfully ornamented and
   replenished, yet all things will be reduced to solitude and desolation
   whenever God is angry. And he afterwards adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [211] Literally, "chiding the sea, he even made it dry." The v here,
   though conversive, must be rendered, "even," for the first verb is a
   participle. By taking the words in their poetical order, the whole
   verse may be thus rendered, -- Chiding the sea, he even made it dry;
   And all the rivers he dried up:
   Wither did Bashan and Carmel,
   And the bud of Lebanon withered. The verbs in this, and in the
   following verse, are in the past tense; reference is made to the past
   works of God, and in some instances to those performed in the
   wilderness. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Nahum 1:5

   5. The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is
   burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.

   5. Montes concutientur ab eo (vel, contremiscent, quanquam notat
   continuum actum; sensus est igitur, montes contremiscere ad nutum
   ejus,) et colles dissolvent se (hoc est, solvuntur, vel, liquefiunt,)
   et ardet terra a facie ejus, et orbis et omnes qui habitant in eo.


   Nahum continues still on the same subject, -- that when God ascended
   his tribunal and appeared as the Judge of the world, he would not only
   shake all the elements, but would also constrain them to change their
   nature. For what can be less consonant to nature than for mountains to
   tremble, and for hills to be dissolved or to melt? This is more strange
   than what we can comprehend. But the Prophet intimates that the
   mountains cannot continue in their own strength, but as far as they are
   sustained by the favor of God. As soon, then, as God is angry, the
   mountains melt like snow, and flow away like water. And all these
   things are to be applied to this purpose, and are designed for this
   end, -- that the wicked might not daringly despise the threatening of
   God, nor think that they could, through his forbearance, escape the
   punishment which they deserved: for he will be their Judge, however he
   may spare them; and though God is ready to pardon, whenever men hate
   themselves on account of their sins, and seriously repent; he will be
   yet irreconcilable to all the reprobate and the perverse. The
   mountains, then, before him tremble, and the hills dissolve or melt.

   This useful instruction may be gathered from these words, that the
   world cannot for a moment stand, except as it is sustained by the favor
   and goodness of God; for we see what would immediately be, as soon as
   God manifests the signals of his judgment. Since the very solidity of
   mountains would be as snow or wax, what would become of miserable men,
   who are like a shadow or an apparition? They would then vanish away as
   soon as God manifested his wrath against them, as it is so in Psalm 39,
   that men pass away like a shadow. This comparison ought ever to be
   remembered by us whenever a forgetfulness of God begins to creep over
   us, that we may not excite his wrath by self-complacencies, than which
   there is nothing more pernicious. Burned, [212] then shall be the
   earth, and the world, and all who dwell on it
     __________________________________________________________________

   [212] This sense has been given to the verb by the Rabbins, which is
   inconsistent with it as found here without any variations, and with the
   Greek versions. ts' is either from ns', to lift up, or from s'h, to be
   laid waste, or to be confounded, the final h being dropped; and this is
   what Newcome adopts. Marckius and Henderson take the former meaning in
   the sense of being raised up or heaving. "Anestale, was removed,"
   Sept.; "Ekinethe, was moved," Symmachus; "Ephrixen, trembled," Aquila.
   The idea of being confounded or laid waste harmonizes best with all
   parts of the sentence; for the idea of having does not apply well to
   the inhabitants. We see here that all the Greek versions have the verb
   in the past tense; and so are the previous verbs in the verse as given
   in the Septuagint, and agreeably with the Hebrew. Mountains have shaken
   through him,
   And hills have melted away;
   And confounded has been the earth at his presence,
   Yea, the world and all its inhabitants.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou settest before us here as in a mirror
   how dreadful thy wrath is, we may be humbled before thee, and of our
   ownselves cast ourselves down, that we may not be laid prostrate by thy
   awful power, -- O grant, that we may by this instruction be really
   prepared for repentance, and so suppliantly deprecate that punishment
   which we daily deserve through our transgressions, that in the meantime
   we may be also transformed into the image of thy Son, and put off all
   our depraved lusts, and be cleansed from our vices, until we shall at
   length appear in confidence before thee, and be gathered among thy
   children, that we may enjoy the eternal inheritance of thy heavenly
   kingdom, which has been obtained for us by the blood of thy Son. Amen.

   Lecture One Hundredth
     __________________________________________________________________

   Nahum 1:6

   6. Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the
   fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the
   rocks are thrown down by him.

   6. Coram indignatione ejus quis stabit? Et quis consistet in furore
   irae ejus? Furor ejus effunditur tanquam ignis, et rupes solvuntur ab
   eo.


   The Prophet shows here why he gave in the part noticed in the last
   lecture, such an awful description of God; it was that men might know,
   that when they shall come before his tribunal, no one will be able to
   stand unless supported by his favor. Of the Prophet's main object we
   have sufficiently spoken, nor is it necessary to repeat here what has
   been stated. It is enough to bear this in mind, -- that as the enemies
   of the Church relied on their power; and daringly and immoderately
   raged against it, the judgment of God is here set before them, that
   they might understand that an account was to be rendered to him whose
   presence they were not able to bear. But the question has more force
   than if the Prophet had simply said, that the whole world could not
   stand before God: for he assumes the character of one adjuring. After
   having shown how terrible God is, he exclaims, Who shall stand before
   his indignation? and who shall be able to bear his wrath? [213] for his
   indignation, he says, is poured forth as fire. The Hebrew interpreters
   have here toiled in vain: as the verb ntk, nutae, means to pour forth
   it seems to them an inconsistent expression, that the wrath of God
   should be poured forth as fire; for this would be more suitably said of
   some metal than of fire. But to be poured forth here is nothing else
   than to be scattered far and wide. Poured forth then is thy wrath as
   fire; that is, it advances every moment, as when a fire seizes a whole
   forest; and when it grows strong, we know how great is its violence,
   and how suddenly it spreads here and there. But if a different meaning
   be preferred, I do not much object to it, "His wrath, which is like
   fire, is poured out."

   Some think that the Prophet alludes to lightnings, which, as it were,
   melt through the air, at least as they appear to us. But as the meaning
   of the Prophet is sufficiently evident, there is no need of anxiously
   inquiring how fire is poured out: for I have already mentioned, that
   the Prophet means no other thing than the wrath of God spreads itself,
   so that it immediately takes hold, not only of one city but also of the
   widest regions and of the whole world, and is therefore like fire, for
   it passes through here and there, and that suddenly.

   He then says, that rocks are also broken or dissolved before him We
   must be aware how great our brittleness is. Since there is no hardness
   which melts not before God, how can men, who flow away of themselves
   like water, be so daring as to set themselves up against him? We hence
   see that the madness of men is here rebuked, who, trusting in their own
   strength, dare to contend even with God, because they forget their own
   frailty. This is the import of the whole. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [213]   And who shall rise up against his hot anger? -- Newcome.
   And who can subsist in the heat of his anger? -- Henderson. Neither of
   these versions convey the meaning. The verb qvm, with a v after it,
   signifies to rise up against or resist. Tis antistesetai -- Who shall
   resist? -- Sept. So the line should be thus rendered, -- And who can
   resist the burning of his wrath? This line conveys the same idea as the
   former, only in stronger terms. For displeasure or anger we have here
   the burning of his wrath, and for standing we have resisting. Can is
   better than will; the Hebrew future ought often to be thus rendered.
   With the view of giving the words here used their distinctive
   character, I offer the following version of the whole verse, -- Before
   his anger who can stand?
   And who can resist the burning of his wrath?
   His indignation has been poured forth like fire;
   And rocks have been broken in pieces by him. The two last verbs are in
   the past tense, and are more expressive when so rendered. -- Ed.

   Nahum 1:7

   7. The Lord is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he
   knoweth them that trust in him.

   7. Bonus Jehova ad fortitudinem in die angustiae, et cognoscens
   sperantes in se.


   The Prophet expresses more clearly here what we referred to in our last
   lecture, -- that God is hard and severe toward refractory men, and that
   he is merciful and kind to the teachable and the obedient, -- not that
   God changes his nature, or that like Proteus he puts on various forms;
   but because he treats men according to their disposition. [214] As then
   the Prophet has hitherto taught us, that God's wrath cannot be
   sustained by mortals; so now, that no one might complain of extreme
   rigor, he, on the other hand, shows that God favors what is right and
   just, that he is gentle and mild to the meek, and therefore ready to
   bring help to the faithful, and that he leaves none of those who trust
   in him destitute of his aid.

   First, by saying that God is good, he turns aside whatever might be
   objected on the ground of extreme severity. There is indeed nothing
   more peculiar to God than goodness. Now when he is so severe, that the
   very mention of his name terrifies the whole world, he seems to be in a
   manner different from himself. Hence the Prophet now shows that
   whatever he had hitherto said of the dreadful judgment of God, is not
   inconsistent with his goodness. Though God then is armed with vengeance
   against his enemies he yet ceases not to be like himself, nor does he
   forget his goodness. But the Prophet does here also more fully confirm
   the Israelites and the Jews in the belief, that God is not only
   terrible to the ungodly, but that, as he has promised to be the
   guardian of his Church, he would also succor the faithful, and in time
   alleviate their miseries. Good then is Jehovah; and it is added for
   help The intention of the Prophet may be hence more clearly understood,
   when he says that he is for strength in the day of distress; as though
   he said, -- "God is ever ready to bring help to his people:" [215] And
   he adds, in the day of distress, that the faithful may not think that
   they are rejected, when God tries their patience by adversities. How
   much soever then God may subject his people to the cross and to
   troubles, he still succors them in their distress.

   He lastly adds, He knows them who hope in him. This to know, is no
   other thing than not to neglect them. Hence God is said to know them
   who hope in him, because he always watches over them, and takes care of
   their safety: in short, this knowledge is nothing else but the care of
   God, or his providence in preserving the faithful. The Prophet, at the
   same time, distinguishes the godly and sincere worshipers of God from
   hypocrites: when God leaves many destitute who profess to believe in
   him, he justly withholds from them his favor, for they do not from the
   heart call on him or seek him.

   We now then understand the Prophet's meaning. He shows, on the one
   hand, that God is armed with power to avenge his enemies; And, on the
   other, he shows that God, as he has promised, is a faithful guardian of
   his Church. How is this proved? He sets before us what God is, that he
   is good; and then adds, that he is prepared to bring help. But he does
   not in vain mention this particular, -- that he takes care of the
   faithful, who truly, and from the heart, hope in him; it is done, that
   they may understand that they are not neglected by God, and also that
   hypocrites may know that they are not assisted, because their
   profession is nothing else but dissimulation, for they hope not
   sincerely in God, however they may falsely boast of his name. It now
   follows --

   [214] "This glorious description of the Sovereign of the world, like
   the pillar of cloud and fire, has a bright side towards Israel, and a
   dark side towards the Egyptians." -- Henry.

   [215] This is no doubt the right view. The object here is not to assert
   generally that God is good, but that he is good for aid and help in the
   day of distress. The versions then both of Newcome and Henderson are
   faulty; for they divide into two clauses what is one in the original,
   -- Good is Jehovah for protection in the day of distress;
   And he knoweth them who trust in him. The word myz is from z, strength,
   and having the formative m, it attains a causative sense, and means
   that which affords or gives strength, -- a fortress, a stronghold, or
   protection. -- Ed.

   Nahum 1:8

   8. But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place
   thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.

   8. Et cum inundatione (vel, per inundationem) transiens consumptionem
   faciet locoejus; et inimicos ejus persequentur tenebrae (vel, persequi
   faciet inimicos suos a tenebris.)


   The Prophet goes on with the same subject, -- that God can easily
   preserve his people, for he is armed with power sufficient to overcome
   the whole world. But the Prophet now includes the two things which have
   been mentioned: Having spoken in general of God's wrath, and of his
   goodness towards the faithful, he now applies his doctrine to the
   consolation of his chosen people. It is then a special application of
   his doctrine, when he says, By inundation, he, passing through, will
   make a consummation in her place There is a twofold interpretation of
   this verse.

   Some make this distinction, -- that God, as it were, in passing
   through, would consume the land of Israel and Judah, but that perpetual
   darkness would rest on his enemies. Hence they think, that the distress
   of the chosen people is distinguished from the overthrow of the kingdom
   of Asshur, for God would only for a time punish his own people, while
   he would give up profane and reprobate men to endless destruction.
   Then, by passing through, must be understood, according to these
   interpreters, a temporary distress or punishment; and by darkness,
   eternal ruin, or, so to speak, irreparable calamities. But the Prophet,
   I doubt not, in one connected sentence, denounces ultimate ruin on the
   Assyrians. By inundation, then, he, in passing, will make a
   consummation in her place; that is, God will suddenly overwhelm the
   Assyrian, as though a deluge should rise to cover the whole earth. He
   intimates, that God would not punish the Assyrians by degrees, as men
   sometimes do, who proceed step by step to avenge themselves, but
   suddenly. God, he says, will of a sudden thunder against the Assyrians,
   as when a deluge comes over a land. Hence this passing of God is
   opposed to long or slow progress; as though he said -- "As soon as
   God's wrath shall break forth or come upon the Assyrians, it will be
   all over, for a consummation will immediately follow: by inundation,
   he, passing through, will make a consummation in her place." [216] By
   place he means the ground; as though he had said that God would not
   only destroy the face of the land, but would also destroy the very
   grounds and utterly demolish it. A feminine pronoun is here added,
   because he speaks of the kingdom or nation, as it is usual in Hebrew.
   But it ought especially to be noticed that the Prophet threatens the
   Assyrians, that God would entirely subvert them, that he would not only
   demolish the surface, as, when fire or waters destroy houses, but that
   the Lord would reduce to nothing the land itself, even the very ground.

   He adds, And pursue his enemies shall darkness He has designated the
   Assyrians only by a pronoun, as the Hebrews are wont to do; for they
   set down a pronoun relative or demonstrative, and it is uncertain of
   whom they speak; but they afterwards explain themselves. So does the
   Prophet in this place; for he directs his discourse to the Israelites
   and the Jews, and he begins by announcing God's vengeance on Nineveh
   and its monarchy; but now he speaks as of a thing sufficiently known
   and adds, Pursue shall darkness the enemies of God By this second
   clause he intimates that the ruin of that kingdom would be perpetual.
   As then he had said that its destruction would be sudden, as God would,
   as it were, in a moment destroy the whole land; so now he cuts off from
   them every hope, that they might not think that they could within a
   while gather strength and rise again as it is the case with the wicked,
   who ever contend against God. The Prophet then shows that evil which
   God would bring on them would be without remedy. Some render the verb
   yrrph, iredaph, transitively in this form, "He will pursue his enemies
   by darkness:" but as to the meaning of the Prophet there is but little
   or no difference; I therefore leave the point undecided. On the subject
   itself there is nothing ambiguous; the import of what is said is, --
   that God would, by a sudden inundation, destroy his enemies, -- and
   that he would destroy them without affording any hope of restoration,
   for perpetual darkness would follow that sudden deluge. He afterwards
   adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [216] The first words in this line are better rendered in our version,
   "With an overrunning flood," or, as by Newcome, "With an overflowing
   torrent," or as by Henderson, "With an overflowing inundation." The
   remaining part has occasioned a variety. The text as it is, and there
   are no different readings, is this, "A full end he will make of her
   place;" or, as Henderson renders it, "He will effect a consummation of
   her place." The only difficulty is, that "her" has no near antecedent;
   but it is not unusual with the Prophets to allow the general context to
   supply this. As the vision is the "burden of Nineveh," that city is no
   doubt referred to. Newcome, following the Greek versions, excepting
   that of Symmachus, translates thus, -- "He will make a full end of
   those who rise up against him." But it is better to follow the Hebrew
   text; for the many evident instances of mistake which are to be found
   in those versions forbid us to put any great confidence in them. The
   following may be viewed as a literal version: -- And with inundation
   overflowing
   A full end he will make her place;
   And darkness shall his enemies pursue. How completely has this prophecy
   been fulfilled! Lucian, a Greek heathen author of the second century,
   has these remarkable words, -- Ninos men apololen ede, kai ouden ichnos
   eti loipon autes, oud an eipes opou pot en -- "Nineveh has already been
   destroyed, and there is no vestige of it remaining, nor can you say
   where formerly it was." Bochart enumerates different conjectures which
   various authors have made as to its situation, most of them differing
   from one another. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Nahum 1:9

   9. What do ye imagine against the Lord? he will make an utter end:
   affliction shall not rise up the second time.

   9. Quid cogitatis contra Jehovam? Consumptionem ipse facit; non
   consurget iterum afflictio.


   Some interpreters so consider this verse also, as though the Prophet
   had said, that the calamity of the chosen people would not be a
   destruction, as God would observe some moderation and keep within
   certain limits. The unbelieving, we know, immediately exult, whenever
   the children of God are oppressed by adverse things, as though it were
   all over with the Church. Hence the Prophet here, according to these
   interpreters, meets and checks this sort of petulance, What imagine ye
   against God? He will indeed afflict his Church, but he will not repeat
   her troubles, for he will be satisfied with one affliction. They also
   think that the kingdom of Judah is here compared with the kingdom of
   Israel: for the kingdom of Israel had been twice afflicted: for, first,
   four tribes had been led away, and then the whole kingdom had been
   overturned. As then one calamity had been inflicted by Shalmanezar, and
   another by Tiglathpilezar, they suppose that there is here an implied
   comparison, as though the Prophet said, "God will spare the kingdom of
   Judah, and will not repeat his vengeance, as it happened to the kingdom
   of Israel." But this meaning is forced and too far-fetched. The Prophet
   then, I doubt not, continues here his discourse, and denounces
   perpetual ruin on the enemies of the Church. He says first, What
   imagine ye against Jehovah? He exults over the Assyrians, because they
   thought that they had to do only with mortals, and also with a mean
   people, and now worn out by many misfortunes. For we know that the
   kingdom of Judah had been weakened by many wars before the Assyrians
   made an irruption into the land: they had suffered two severe and
   grievous attacks from their neighbors, the king of Israel and the king
   of Syria; for then it was that they made the Assyrians their
   confederates. When therefore the Assyrians came against Judea, they
   thought that they would have no trouble in obtaining victory, as they
   engaged in war with an insignificant people, and as we have said, worn
   out by evils. But the Prophet shows here that the war was with the
   living God, and not with men, as they falsely thought. What then
   imagine ye against Jehovah? as though he said, "Know ye not that this
   people are under the care and protection of God? Ye cannot then attack
   the kingdom of Judah without having God as your opponent. As it is
   certain that this people are defended by a divine power, there is no
   reason for you to think that you will be victorious." At the same time,
   I know not why the Prophet's words should be confined to the tribe of
   Judah, since the purpose was to comfort the Israelites as well as the
   Jews.

   Now this is a very useful doctrine; for the Prophet teaches us in
   general, that the ungodly, whenever they harass the Church, not only do
   wrong to men, but also fight with God himself; for he so connects us
   with himself, that all who hurt us touch the apple of his eye, as he
   declares in another place, (Zechariah 2:8.) We may then gather
   invaluable comfort from these words; for we can fully and boldly set up
   this shield against our enemies, -- that they devise their counsels,
   and make efforts against God, and assail him; for he takes us under his
   protection for this end, that whenever we are injured, he may stand in
   the middle as our defender. This is one thing.

   Now in the second clause he adds, that he will make a complete end,
   Rise up again shall not distress; that is, God is able to reduce you to
   nothing, so that there will be no need to assail you the second time.
   This passage, we know, has been turned to this meaning, -- that God
   does not punish men twice nor exceed moderation in his wrath: but this
   is wholly foreign to the mind of the Prophet. I have also said already
   that I do not approve of what others have said, who apply this passage
   to the Church and especially to the kingdom of Judah. For I thus simply
   interpret the words of the Prophet, -- that God can with one onset,
   when it seems good to him, so destroy his enemies, that there will be
   no need of striving with them the second time: Il n'y faudra plus
   retourner, as we say in our language. God then will make a full end;
   that is, he will be able in one moment to demolish his enemies and the
   ruin will be complete, that is, the wasting will be entire. There will
   be no distress again or the second time; for it will be all over with
   the enemies of God; not that God observes always the same rule when he
   punishes his enemies, nor does Nahum here prescribe any general rule;
   but he simply means, that God, whenever it pleases him, instantly
   destroys his enemies. He afterwards adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Nahum 1:10

   10. For while they be folden together as thorns, and while they are
   drunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry.

   10. Qui ad spinas perplexas et tanquam potatione sua ebrios (vel, et
   ebrios ubi inebriati fuerint; potest enim duplex sensus; postea)
   devorabuntur tanquam stipulae ariditatis planae (vel, quasi stipula
   ariditatis in plenitudine, vel, arida in plenitudine.)


   He goes on with this same subject, -- that Gods when he pleases to
   exercise his power, can, with no difficulty, consume his enemies: for
   the similitude, which is here added, means this, -- that nothing is
   safe from God's vengeance; for by perplexed thorns he understands
   things difficult to be handled. When thorns are entangled, we dare not,
   with the ends of our fingers, to touch their extreme parts; for
   wherever we put our hands, thorns meet and prick us. As then pricking
   from entangled thorns make us afraid, so none of us dare to come nigh
   them. Hence the Prophet says, they who are as entangled thorns; that is
   "However thorny ye may be, however full of poison, full of fury, full
   of wickedness, full of frauds, full of cruelty, ye may be, still the
   Lord can with one fire consume you, and consume you without any
   difficulty." They were then as entangled thorns.

   And then, as drunken by their own drinking. If we read so, the meaning
   is, -- God or God's wrath will come upon you as on drunker men; who,
   though they exult in their own intemperance, are yet enervated, and are
   not fit for fighting, for they have weakened their strength by extreme
   drinking. There seems indeed to be much vigor in a drunken man, for he
   swaggers immoderately and foams out much rage; but yet he may be cast
   down by a finger; and even a child can easily overcome a drunken
   person. It is therefore an apt similitude, -- that God would manage the
   Assyrians as the drunken are wont to be managed; for the more audacity
   there is in drunken men, the easier they are brought under; for as they
   perceive no danger, and are, as it were, stupefied, so they run
   headlong with greater impetuosity. "In like manners" he says, "extreme
   satiety will be the cause of your ruin, when I shall attack you. Ye are
   indeed very violent; but all this your fury is altogether drunkenness:
   Come, he says, to you shall the vengeance of God as to those drunken
   with their own drinking [217]

   Some render the last words, "To the drunken according to their
   drinking;" and this sense also is admissible; but as the Prophet's
   meaning is still the same, I do not contend about words. Others indeed
   give to the Prophet's words a different sense: but I doubt not but that
   he derides here that haughtiness by which the Assyrians were swollen,
   and compares it to drunkenness; as though he said, "Ye are indeed more
   than enough inflated and hence all tremble at your strength; but this
   your excess rather debilitates and weakens your powers. When God then
   shall undertake to destroy you as drunken men, your insolence will
   avail you nothing; but, on the contrary, it will be the cause of your
   ruin as ye offer yourselves of your own accord; and the Lord will
   easily cast you down, as when one, by pushing a drunken man,
   immediately throws him on the ground."

   And these comparisons ought to be carefully observed by us: for when
   there seems to be no probability of our enemies being destroyed, God
   can with one spark easily consume them. How so? for as fire consumes
   thorns entangled together, which no man dares to touch, so God can with
   one spark destroy all the wicked, however united together they may be.
   And the other comparison affords us also no small consolation; for when
   our enemies are insolent, and throw out high swelling words, and seem
   to frighten and to shake the whole world with their threatening, their
   excess is like drunkenness; there is no strength within; they are
   frantic but not strong, as is the case with all drunken men.

   And he says, They shall be devoured as stubble of full dryness ml',
   mela, means not only to be full, but also to be perfect or complete.
   Others render the words, "As stubble full of dryness," but the sense is
   the same. He therefore intimates, that there would be nothing to
   prevent God from consuming the enemies of his Church; for he would make
   dry their whole vigor, so that they would differ nothing from stubble,
   and that very dry, which is in such a state, that it will easily take
   fire. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [217] Newcome, on the sole authority of the Syriac and the Targum,
   changes "thorns" into "princes," and thus wholly destroys the propriety
   of the simile of dry stubble at the end of the verse. Henderson says
   justly, that this change is on no account to be adopted. Though like
   thorns, entwined,
   And as with their drinking drunken,
   They shall be consumed as stubble fully dry. The particle d, before
   "thorns," is to be here taken as in 1 Chronicles 4:27, as designating
   likeness. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Nahum 1:11

   11. There is one come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the
   Lord, a wicked counsellor.

   11. Ex te egressus est cogitans (vel, consultans) contra Jehovam malum,
   consultor Beliiaal (hoc est, impius, vel, perversus; alii vertunt,
   Nihili.)


   The Prophet now shows why God was so exceedingly displeased with the
   Assyrians, and that was, because he would, as a protector of his
   Church, defend the distressed against those who unjustly oppressed
   them. The Prophet then designed here to give the Jews a firm hope, so
   that they might know that God had a care for their safety; for if he
   had only threatened the Assyrians without expressing the reason, of
   what avail could this have been to the Jews? It is indeed gratifying
   and pleasing when we see our enemies destroyed; but this would be a
   cold and barren comfort, except we were persuaded that it is done by
   God's judgment, because he loves us, because he would defend us, having
   embraced us with paternal love; but when we know this, we then triumph
   even when in extreme evils. We are indeed certain of our salvation,
   when God testifies, and really proves also, that he is not only
   propitious to us, but that our salvation is an object of his care. This
   is the Prophet's design when he thus addresses Nineveh.

   From thee has gone forth a devisor of evil against Jehovah, an impious
   adviser The manner of speaking is much more emphatical, when he says,
   that the Assyrians consulted against God, than if he had said, that
   they had consulted against the Jews, or consulted against the chosen
   people of God.

   But though this was said of the Jews, let us yet remember that it
   belongs also to us. The Prophet confirms the doctrine which I lately
   alluded to, that whenever the ungodly cause trouble to us, they carry
   on war with God himself, that whenever they devise any evil against us,
   they run headlong against him. For God sets up himself as a shield, and
   declares, that he will protect under the shadow of his wings all those
   who commit themselves to his protection. If we then lie hid under the
   guardianship of God, and flee to him in all our adversities, and while
   patiently enduring all wrongs, implore his protection and help,
   whosoever then will rise up against us will have God as his enemy. Why
   so? because he consults against him. And this reason shows, that
   whatever the Prophet has hitherto said against the Assyrians ought to
   be extended indiscriminately to all the enemies of the Church. For why
   did God threaten the Assyrians with a sudden inundation and with
   perpetual darkness? The reason is here subjoined, -- because they
   consulted against him and his Church. The same thing then will also
   happen to our enemies, provided we remain quiet, as it has been said,
   under the protection of God.

   But when he says that he had gone forth from that city who contrived
   evil against Jehovah, -- this ought not to be confined to Sennacherib,
   but must rather be viewed as common to all the Assyrians; as though he
   said, "Thou produces the fruit which thou shalt eat; for from thee will
   arise the cause of thy ruin. There is no reason for thee to expostulate
   with God, as though he cruelly raged against thee; for from thee has
   gone forth he who devised evil against Jehovah: thou reapest now the
   reward worthy of thy bringing forth; for where have originated counsels
   against the Church of God, except in thine own bosom, and in thine own
   bowels? The evil then which has proceeded from thee shall return on
   thine own head."

   He then adds, An impious consulter, or counselor, vlyl yvph, ivots
   beliol. Respecting the word vlyl, beliol, the Hebrews themselves are
   not agreed. There are those who suppose it to be a compound word, vl
   yl, It profits not; and they think that it is applied to designate
   things of nought as well as men of nought. [218] There are others who,
   like Jerome, render it, Without a yoke, but without reason. Then
   Beliol, is properly a vain thing, which is wholly unsubstantial; and so
   it designates a man in whom there is no integrity. It is also applied
   to all the wicked, and to their crimes: hence a thing or work of Belial
   is said to be any heinous sin or a detestable crime; and the man who
   acts perversely and wickedly is called Belial. And Paul takes Belial
   simply for the very gravity of Satan, and of all the wicked; for he
   opposes Belial to Christ, (2 Corinthians 6:15.) We now then understand
   the meaning of the Prophet to be this, -- that God denounces war on the
   Assyrians, because they made war unjustly on his people, and consulted
   not only against the Jews, but also against God, who had taken them, as
   it has been stated, under his own keeping and protection. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [218] "From vl, not, and yl, profit: -- As an abstract noun,
   unprofitableness, worthlessness, wickedness: -- As an adjective,
   worthless, wicked, good for nothing." -- Parkhurst. "It alludes to
   Baal, the common idol of the natives bordering upon the Jews, whom the
   penmen of Scripture changing some letters by way of scorn called
   Belial: to express a further hatred to this idol, they applied this
   name to the devil, 2 Corinthians 6:15; which word is derived either
   from a root that signifieth not to profit, or not to mount upward,
   because he seeks the fall of mankind, and to keep those that are fallen
   into his snares, 2 Timothy 2:26 Jerome fetcheth it from a root, which,
   with another word, signifieth without a yoke, or, lawless; therefore
   the Septuagint commonly translate it, paranomos." -- Leigh.

   Nahum 1:12

   12. Thus saith the Lord; Though they be quiet, and likewise many, yet
   thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through. Though I have
   afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.

   12. Sic dixit Jehovah, Si tranquilli fuerint, utcunque fuerint multi
   (vel, potentes;) sic etiam tollentur et transibit: et si afflixerim te,
   non affligam te amplius.


   The Prophet pursues here the same subject; but expresses more clearly
   what might have been doubtful, -- that whatever strength there might be
   in the Assyrians, it could not resist the coming of God's vengeance.
   For thus saith Jehovah, Though they be quiet and also strong, etc. I
   cannot now finish this subject, but will only say this, -- The Prophet
   intimates that though Nineveh promised to itself a tranquil state,
   because it was well fortified, and had a wide and large extent of
   empire, yet this thy peace, he says, or this thy confidence and
   security, shall not be an impediment, that the hand of God should not
   be extended to thee. Though, then, they be many or strong etc.; for we
   can render rvym, rebim, strong as well as many; but either would suit
   this place; for we understand the Prophet's meaning to be, that all
   God's enemies would be cut off, however secure they might be, while
   depending on their own strength and fortresses. The rest to-morrow.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that inasmuch as thou sees thy enemies at this day
   raging with cruel, yea, with diabolic fury against thy Church, we may
   find thee to be the same as the faithful in all former ages had found
   thee, even a defender of the safety of those who truly, and with a
   sincere heart, called on thee, and sought thee in extreme necessity;
   and do thou, at this day, stretch forth thine hand, and so restrain the
   fury which thou sees is against all thy servants and thy children, that
   the wicked may at length really find, even to their ruin, that they
   fight not with miserable mortals, disheartened and without defense, but
   with thine ineffable power, that they may be confounded, though not
   ashamed, and that, however they may glamour against thee and thine
   invincible hand, they may yet become an example and a manifest
   evidence, that thou art not only faithful in thy promises, but also
   armed with power, by which thou canst execute whatsoever thou hast
   promised respecting the preservation of thy Church, until thou at
   length gatherest us into that blessed rest, which has been provided for
   us by the blood of thy Son. Amen.

   Lecture One Hundred and First

   We stated yesterday what the Prophet meant by these words, that though
   the Assyrians were quiet and many, they would yet be suddenly cut off
   by the Lord. He clearly intimates, that the wicked are never so
   fortified by their own forces or by the help of others, but that the
   Lord can, without any difficulty, destroy them.

   As to the words, some connect the particle kn, can with what he had
   said, "Though they be quiet," and give this version, "Though they be
   quiet and in like manner many, that is, though they be secure, thinking
   themselves safe from all danger, and so also trust in their own number,
   yet they shall be removed." But the repetition of kn in Hebrew is
   common; and the sentence may be thus explained, Though they be quiet,
   and how many soever they may be, yet thus shall they be removed. vkn
   vkn, ucan ucan, that is, "As they are many, so also the many shall be
   destroyed." With regard to the verb gvzguz, (but some, though not
   correctly, derive it from gzz, gezaz,) I take it in the sense of
   removing from the middle, of destroying: it properly means in Hebrew to
   remove to a distance, though almost all interpreters render it, "They
   are shorn," which ought rather to be, "They shall be shorn:" and both
   the verbs, gvz, guz as well as gzz, gizaz, mean to clip or shear: but
   as the other sense suits the form of the Prophet's discourse better, I
   hesitate not thus to render it, "They shall be taken away," or
   destroyed. What the Prophet next adds, vvr, uober, and he shall pass,
   is applied by some to the angel, by whom the army of Sennacherib was
   destroyed. Others think that a temporary pestilence is meant; as though
   he had said, that it would only pass through. But the Prophet seems to
   refer to a former clause, where he said, that God would suddenly
   destroy the Assyrians as it were with a sudden and unexpected deluge.
   This, then, is the most suitable meaning, that however much the
   Assyrians excelled in number of men and in strength, they would yet be
   suddenly destroyed; for the Lord would pass through, that is, the Lord
   would by one onset reduce them to nothing. [219]

   Then it follows, Though (and, literally) I have afflicted thee, yet
   afflict thee will I no more. But this sentence must be thus rendered,
   Though thee have I afflicted, I will not afflict thee any more.' The
   Prophet meets a doubt, which might have laid hold on the perplexed
   minds of the faithful; for they saw that God had been hitherto angry
   with them. They might then have succumbed under their griefs had it not
   been added, that they had indeed been afflicted for a time, but that
   God would now put an end to his severity, for he would no longer
   afflict them. It is indeed certain, that they were often afflicted
   afterwards; but this ought to be confined to what the Assyrians had
   done; for we know that our Prophet directed his predictions chiefly
   against that monarchy: and then the monarchy of Babylon succeeded; but
   it was necessary that Nineveh should be first subverted, and that the
   government should be transferred to the Chaldeans, that the Israelites
   as well as the Jews might know, that that monarchy had been overthrown,
   because it rebelled against God himself by distressing his own people.

   We now then perceive the intention of the Prophet: after having
   threatened the Assyrians, he now turns his discourse to the Israelites,
   Though I have afflicted thee, I will no more afflict thee; that is,
   There is no reason for the faithful to despond, because they have been
   hitherto severely treated by God; let them on the contrary remembers
   that these scourges are temporary, and that God's displeasure with his
   elect people and his Church is such that he observes moderation; for
   this must ever be fulfilled, --

   In the moment of mine indignation I smote thee;
   but I will show thee perpetual mercies,' (Isaiah 54:8.)

   This promise has been once given to the Church; and it is now in force,
   and will be in force to the end of the world. Thus we see that the
   Prophet obviated a doubt, lest the faithful should think that there was
   no hope for them, because they had found God so severe towards them;
   for he says that God was satisfied with the punishment which he had
   inflicted and that he would no longer afflict his people. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [219] The best and the most literal version of these two lines, with
   the exception of the last word, is that of Dr. Wheeler, as given by
   Newcome, -- Though they are at peace, and also mighty,
   Still shall they be cut off and pass away. The last verb is in the
   singular number, vvd, "and he shall pass through" or away, that is, the
   wicked counselor mentioned in the preceding verse. Newcome's own
   version is that of new text, which he has himself formed, from a mere
   hint derived from the Septuagint. Henderson's version is the following,
   -- Though they are complete and so very numerous,
   Yet in this state they shall be cut off,
   And he shall pass away. The word slmym means, no doubt, entire,
   complete, perfect, as well as to be at peace, secure, quiet; and may be
   referred, as the author says, to the complete condition of the Assyrian
   army: but what seems to be intended is the character of the nation. --
   Ed.

   Nahum 1:13

   13. For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy
   bonds in sunder.

   13. Et nunc conteram (vel, confringam) jugum ejus ab te, et vincula tua
   disrumpam.


   He confirms what the former verse contains, -- that God would now cease
   from his rigor; for he says, that the deliverance of this chosen people
   was nigh, when God would break down and reduce to nothing the tyranny
   of that empire. This verse clearly shows, that a clause in the
   preceding verse ought not to be so restricted as it is by some
   interpreters, who regard it as having been said of the slaughter of the
   army of Sennacherib. But the Prophet addresses here in common both the
   Israelites and the Jews, as it is evident from the context; and this
   verse also sufficiently proves, the Prophet does not speak of the Jews
   only; for they had not been so subdued by the Assyrians as the
   Israelites had been. I indeed allow that they became tributaries; for
   when they had broken their covenant, the Assyrian, after having
   conquered the kingdom of Israel and the kingdom of Syria, extended his
   arms at length to Judea. It is then certain, that they had been in some
   measure under the yoke; but it was not so hard a servitude that the
   words of the Prophet could be applied to it. I therefore take the
   expression generally, that God would free from the tyranny of Nineveh
   his own people, both the Israelites and the Jews. If any one objects
   and says, that the Israelites were never delivered. This indeed is
   true; but as to Nineveh, they were delivered when the empire was
   transferred to the Chaldeans, and Babylon became the seat of the
   empire.

   We now then see, that the meaning of our Prophet is simply this, --
   that though God by the Assyrians chastised his people, he yet did not
   forget his covenant, for the Assyrians were punished. It was then
   sufficient for his purpose to say that the Jews as well as the
   Israelites were no longer under the yoke of Nineveh, how much soever
   they might have afterwards suffered under other tyrants. And what is
   said about the yoke being broken, belongs also in some measure to the
   Jews; for when we extend this to both, the Israelites and also the
   Jews, it would not be unsuitable to say, that they were both under the
   yoke and bound with chains. For though the servitude of Israel was
   hard, yet the Jews had also been deprived of their liberty. It is then
   right that this which is said should be taken generally, I will now
   break his yoke from thee, and thy bonds will I burst

   Now this verse teaches us, that the people were not so subdued by the
   tyranny of their enemies, but that their deliverance was always in the
   hand and power of God. For how came it, that the Assyrians prevailed
   against the Israelites, and then subjugated the Jews, except that they
   were as a rod in the hand of God? So Isaiah teaches us in the tenth
   chapter. Though they armed themselves, they were yet but as the weapons
   and arms of God, for they could not have made any movement, except the
   Lord had turned their course, wherever he pleased, as when one throws a
   javelin or a dart with his hand. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Nahum 1:14

   14. And the LORD hath given a commandment concerning thee, that no more
   of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the
   graven image and the molten image: I will make thy grave; for thou art
   vile.

   14. Et mandavit super te Jehova, Ne seminetur ex nomine tuo posthac; e
   domo (vel, e templo) deorum tuorum excidam sculptile et conflatile;
   ponam sepulchrum tuum, quia execrabilis es (aut, vilis factus es.)


   Nahum explains more clearly, and without a figure, what he had
   previously said of darkness, -- that the kingdom of Nineveh would be so
   overturned, that it could never recruit its strength and return again
   to its pristine state. He indeed addresses the king himself, but under
   his person he includes no doubt the whole kingdom.

   Commanded then has Jehovah, he says, respecting thee, let there not be
   sown of thy name; that is, God has so decreed, that the memory of thy
   name shall not survive: for to sow from the name of one, is to extend
   his fame. When, therefore, God entirely exterminates a race from the
   world, or when he obliterates a nation, he is said to command that
   there should not be sown of such a name; that is, that there should be
   no propagation of that name. In short, our Prophet denounces on the
   Assyrians a ruin, from which they were never to rise again. And when
   such a command is ascribed to God, it means, that by the sole bidding
   of God both nations and kingdoms are propagated, and are also abolished
   and destroyed: for what is said of individuals ought to be extended to
   all nations, Seed, or the fruit of the womb,' as it is said in the
   Psalms, is the peculiar gift of God,' (Psalm 127.) For how comes it,
   that many are without children, while others have a large and a
   numerous family, except that God blesses some, and makes others barren?
   The same is to be thought of nations; the Lord propagates them and
   preserves their memory; but when it seems good to him, he reduces them
   to nothing, so that no seed remains. And when the Prophet testifies,
   that this is the command of Jehovah, he confirms the faith of the
   Israelites and of the Jews, that they might not doubt, but that the
   Assyrians would perish without any hope of restoration; for it was so
   decreed by Heaven.

   He afterwards adds, From the house, or from the temple, of thy gods
   will I cut off graven images. It is probable, and it is the commonly
   received opinion, that the Prophet alludes here to Sennacherib, who was
   slain in the temple of his idol by his own sons, shortly after his
   return from Judea, when the siege of the holy city was miraculously
   raised through the instrumentality of an angel. As then he was slain in
   the temple, and it was by his murder profaned, I am inclined to receive
   what almost all others maintain, that there is here a reference to his
   person: but, at the same time, the Prophet no doubt describes, under
   the person of one king, the destruction and ruin of the whole kingdom.
   Gods indeed, did at that time make known what he had determined
   respecting the empire of Nineveh and all the Assyrians; for from this
   event followed also the change, that Nebuchodonosor transferred the
   empire to Babylon, and that the whole race, and every one who assumed
   power, became detestable. When, therefore, the Assyrians were torn by
   intestine discords, it was an easy matter for the Chaldeans to conquer
   them. Hence the Prophet does not here predict respecting one king only;
   but as his murder was, as it were, a prelude of the common ruin, the
   Prophet relates this history as being worthy of being remembered, --
   that the temple would be profaned by the murder of Sennacherib, and
   that then the monarchy would be soon transferred to the Chaldeans.

   When he says, I will appoint thy sepulcher, he connects this clause
   with the former; for how was it that idols were cut off from that
   temple, except that that tragic deed rendered the place detestable? For
   there is no one who feels not a horror at such a base crime as that of
   children killing their father with their own hands. We know when a
   proud woman at Rome ordered her chariot to be drawn over the dead body
   of her father, the road was counted polluted. So also the temple was no
   doubt viewed as polluted by the murder of the king. Then these two
   clauses ought to be read together, that God would cut off idols and
   graven images from the temple, -- and then, that the sepulcher of
   Sennacherib would be there.

   He adds, For thou art execrable [220] I have rendered qlvt, kolut, a
   thing to be abominated. It may indeed be referred to that history; but
   I take it by itself as meaning, that Sennacherib was to be abominable,
   and not he alone, but also the whole royal family, and the monarchy of
   Nineveh. For it is not consistent, as we have said already, to say,
   that all these things refer to the person of Sennacherib; for the
   Prophet speaks of the destruction of the city and nation, and that
   generally; at the same time, this does not prevent him from referring,
   as it were, in passing, to the person of Sennacherib.

   It must, at the same time, be noticed, that the vain confidence, which
   the Assyrian kings placed in their idols and graven images, is here
   indirectly reproved; for we know that idolaters not only confide in
   their own strength, but that a part of their hope is also founded on
   their superstitions. Hence the Prophet says, that their temple was to
   be profaned by God, so that no aid would remain to the Assyrians, to
   the kings themselves any more than to the whole people. Let us proceed
   --

   Nahum 1:15

   15. [221] Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good
   tidings, that publisheth peace! O Judah, keep thy solemn feasts,
   perform thy vows: for the wicked shall no more pass through thee; he is
   utterly cut off.

   15. Ecce super montes pedes annunciantis, promulgantis pacem: celebra
   Jehudah solennitates tuas, redde vota tua; quia non adjiciet posthac ad
   transeundum in te, impius (Beliiaal) in totum excisus est.


   The Prophet again teaches us, that whatever he prophesied respecting
   the destruction of the city Nineveh, was for this end, -- that God, by
   this remarkable evidence, might show that he had a care for his people,
   and that he was not unmindful of the covenant he had made with the
   children of Abraham. This prophecy would have otherwise produced no
   salutary effect on the Israelites; they might have thought that it was
   by chance, or by some fatal revolution, or through some other cause,
   that Nineveh had been overthrown. Hence the Prophet shows, that the
   ruin of the city, and of the monarchy of Nineveh, would be a proof of
   the paternal love of God towards his chosen people, and that such a
   change was to be made for the sake of one people, because God, though
   he had for a time punished the Israelites, yet purposed that some seed
   should remain, for it would have been inconsistent, that the covenant,
   which was to be inviolate, should be entirely abolished. We now then
   understand the Prophet's object, and how this verse is to be connected
   with the rest of the context.

   Behold, he says, on the mountains the feet of him who announces peace
   [222] Some think that the Prophet alludes to the situation of
   Jerusalem. We indeed know that mountains were around it: but the
   Prophet speaks more generally, -- that heralds of peace shall ascend to
   the tops of mountains, that their voice might be more extensively
   heard: Behold, he says, on the mountains the feet of him who announces
   peace; for all the roads had been before closed up, and hardly any one
   dared to whisper. If any one inquired either respecting peace or war,
   there was immediate danger lest he should fall under suspicion. As then
   the Assyrians, by their tyrannical rule, had deprived the Israelites of
   the freedom of speech, the Prophet says now, that the feet of those who
   should announce peace would be on the mountains; that is, that there
   would be now free liberty to proclaim peace on the highest places. By
   feet, he means, as we have explained, coming; and Isaiah speaks a
   similar language,

   How beautiful are the feet of those who announce peace,
   who announce good things!' (Isaiah 52:7.)

   Arise, then, he says, shall heralds of peace everywhere: and the
   repetition in other words seems to express this still more clearly; for
   he says, of him who announces and causes to hear He might have simply
   said mvsr, mebesher, but he adds msmy, meshemio; not only, he says, he
   will announce peace, but also with a clear and loud voice, so that his
   preaching may be heard from the remotest places. We now perceive what
   the Prophet had in view, and what his words import.

   Now he adds, Celebrate, Judah, thy festal days. It is indeed a
   repetition of the same word, as if we were to say in Latin, Festiva
   festivitates, feast festivities; but this has nothing to do with the
   meaning of the passage. I am disposed to subscribe to the opinion of
   those who think, that there is here an intimation of the interruption
   of festal days; for so disordered were all things at Jerusalem and in
   the country around, that sacrifices had ceased, and festal days were
   also intermitted; for sacred history tells us, that the Passover was
   celebrated anew under Hezekiah, and also under Josiah. This omission no
   doubt happened, owing to the wars by which the country had been laid
   waste. Hence the Prophet now intimates, that there would be quietness
   and peace for the chosen people, so that they might all without any
   fear ascend to Jerusalem, and celebrate their festal days, and give
   thanks to the Lord, and rejoice before him, according to the language
   often used by Moses. At the same time, the Prophet no doubt reminds the
   Jews for what end the Lord would break off the enemy's yoke, and exempt
   them from servile fear, and that was, that they might sacrifice to God
   and worship him, while enjoying their quiet condition. And that he
   addresses Judah is not done without reason; for though the kingdom of
   Israel was not as yet so rejected, that God did not regard them as his
   people, yet there were no legitimate sacrifices among them, and no
   festal days which God approved: we indeed know that the worship which
   prevailed there was corrupt and degenerated. Inasmuch then as God
   repudiated the sacrifices which were offered in Israel, Nahum addresses
   here his discourse to Judah only; but yet he intimates, that God had
   been thus bountiful to the Israelites, that they, remembering their
   deliverance, might give him thanks.

   Let us then know, that when the Lord grants us tranquillity and
   preserves us in a quiet state, this end ought ever to be kept in view,
   -- that it is his will, that we should truly serve him. But if we abuse
   the public peace given us, and if pleasures occasion a forgetfulness of
   God, this ingratitude will by no means be endured. We ought, indeed, in
   extreme necessities to sacrifice to God, as we have need then
   especially of fleeing to his mercy; but as we cannot so composedly
   worship him in a disturbed state of mind, he is pleased to allow us
   peaceable times. Now, if we misapply this leisure, and indulge in
   sloth, yea, if we become so heedless as to neglect God, this as I have
   said will be an intolerable evil. Let us then take notice of the
   Prophet's words in setting forth the design of God, -- that he would
   free his people from the power of the Assyrians, that they might
   celebrate their festal days.

   He adds, Pay thy vows He not only speaks here of the ordinary
   sacrifices and of the worship which had been prescribed; but he also
   requires a special proof of gratitude for having been then delivered by
   the hand of God; for we know what paying of vows meant among the
   Hebrews: they were wont to offer peace-offerings, when they returned
   victorious from war, or when they were delivered from any danger, or
   when they were relieved from some calamity. The Prophet therefore now
   shows, that it was right to pay vows to God, inasmuch as he had dealt
   so bountifully with his people; as it is said in Psalm 116, What shall
   I return to the Lord for all his benefits which he has bestowed on me?
   The cup of salvation will I take, and on the name of the Lord will I
   call.' We also find it thus written in Hosea,

   The calves of thy lips to me shalt thou render,'
   (Hosea 14:2.)

   We now perceive what Nahum substantially meant, -- that when peace was
   restored, the people were not to bury so great and so remarkable a
   kindness of God, but to pay their vows; that is, that the people were
   to testify that God was the author of their deliverance, and that the
   redemption which they had obtained was the peculiar work of God.

   It follows, "Add no more to pass through thee shall Belial, for utterly
   is he cut off." This passage must not be explained in a general sense;
   for we know that the Chaldeans became more grievous to the Jews than
   the Assyrians had been; but the Prophet here refers especially to the
   Ninevites, that is, to the Assyrians, whose metropolis, as it has been
   said, was Nineveh. That wicked one then shall not add any more to pass
   through thee. -- Why? for he is entirely cut off. This reason given by
   the Prophet clearly proves, that he speaks not of the wicked generally,
   but that he especially points out the Assyrians. Now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [221] This forms the first verse of the second chapter in Hebrew. Most
   versions have followed the division of the Septuagint. -- Ed.

   [222] Calvin gives to mvsr only the sense of announcing or declaring.
   To spread or to bring news or tidings is its meaning; for it is used to
   designate bad as well as good tidings. See 1 Samuel 4:17; 2 Samuel
   1:20; and 2 Samuel 4:10; Isaiah 3:7. It is commonly rendered
   euangelizesthai by the Septuagint. It may be regarded here as a
   participle in the same predicament with the participle which follows.
   The same mode of construction we find in Isaiah 52:7; where it
   evidently appears that the word means strictly to bring or to declare
   tidings, for good is added to it. That passage is as follows: -- How
   beautiful on the mountains
   Are the feet of him who announceth,
   Who proclaimeth peace, --
   Of him who announceth good, (vvt rsvm)
   Who proclaimeth salvation!
   Saying to Zion, Reign doth thy God. -- Ed.

   Chapter 2

   Nahum 2:1-2

   1. He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the
   munition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power
   mightily

   1. Ascendit destructor coram facie tua; custodi munitionem, respice
   viam, robora lumbos, fortifica vires valde:

   2. For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the
   excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and
   marred their vine branches.

   2. Quia abstulit (alii vertunt, recedere fecit; alii, quiescere fecit)
   Jehova fortitudinem (alii, superbiam) Jacob, sicuti fortitudinem (vel,
   superbiam, est idem nomen) Israel; quia evacuarunt avacuantes, et
   palmites eorum succiderunt.


   The waster spoken of here by the Prophet, some consider him to have
   been Sennacherib, and others, Nebuchodonosor. The verb lh, ole, is also
   variously explained: it is often taken metaphorically in Hebrew for
   vanishing, as we say in French, Il s'en va en fumee; for smoke ascends,
   and this is the reason for the metaphor. They then elicit this meaning,
   -- that a destroyer had ascended before the face of the chosen people,
   that is, openly; so that it was evidently the work of God, that the
   Assyrians vanished, who had come to lay waste the whole land: Vanished
   then has the destroyer; and then before thy face, that is, manifestly,
   and before thine eyes. mtsvrh ntsvr, nutsur metsure, guard the
   fortress; that is let every one return to his own city, and keep watch,
   as it is usually done; for the country shall be left without men; and
   watch the way, that is, look out which way Sennacherib took in coming
   to assail the holy city; that way shall be now free from enemies; and
   then, keep firm or strengthen the loins, for chzq, chesek, sometimes
   means to keep firm, -- keep firm then or strengthen the loins, that
   thou mayest not relax as before, but stand courageously, for there is
   no one who can terrify thee; and, lastly, fortify strength greatly,
   that is, doubt not but thou shalt be hereafter strong enough to retain
   thy position; for cut off shall be that monarchy, which has been an
   oppression to thee. But others take a different view and say, -- that
   the destroyer had ascended, that is, that Sennacherib had come; and
   what follows, they think, was intended to strike terror, as though the
   Prophet said "Now while ye are besieged keep watch, and be careful to
   preserve your fortresses and strengthen all your strongholds; but all
   this will avail nothing. -- Why? Because God has taken away the pride
   of Jacob as he has the pride of Israel." This is the second
   explanation. Others again think, that the Prophet addresses here the
   Assyrians, and that Nebuchodonosor is here called a waster, by whom the
   empire was removed, and Nineveh, as it has often been stated, was
   destroyed. According to these interpreters, the Prophet here denounces
   ruin on the Assyrians in this manner, -- "The destroyer now ascends
   before thy face." The Assyrians might indeed have regarded such
   threatening with disdain, when they were surrounded by many provinces
   and had cities well fortified: -- "It will not be," he says, "according
   to your expectation; the waster will yet come" before thy face; and how
   much soever thou mayest now guard thy fortresses, watch thy ways, and
   carefully look around to close up every avenue against thy enemies,
   thou wilt yet effect nothing; strengthen the loins as much as thou
   pleasest and increase thy power, yet this shall be useless and vain."
   If this view be approved, it will be in confirmation of what has been
   previously said, -- that God had now determined to destroy the city
   Nineveh and the empire possessed by the Assyrians. This meaning then is
   not unsuitable; but if we receive this view, something additional must
   also be stated, and that is, -- that God now designed to destroy
   Nineveh and its monarchy, because it had humbled more than necessary
   his people, the kingdom of Judah, as well as the ten tribes. I cannot
   proceed farther now.

   Prayer.

   Grant Almighty God, that since we are daily chastised by thy scourges,
   we may know that we are justly punished by thee, and so examine our
   whole life, that with true and sincere confession we may humbly flee to
   thy mercy, which is offered to us by thy gospel in Christ our Lord; and
   since thou dost also show us so many favors, may we not be ungrateful,
   and may no forgetfulness of thy grace creep over us, but may we
   especially exercise ourselves through our whole life in the worship of
   thy name and in giving thanks to thee, and so offer to thee, with our
   tongues, the sacrifices of praise, that our whole life may be
   consistent, and thus glorify thy name on earth, that at length we may
   be gathered into thy celestial kingdom through the same Christ Jesus
   our Lord. Amen.

   Lecture One Hundred and Second

   We said yesterday that some interpreters regard these words of the
   Prophet, Ascended has the destroyer before it face, guard the fortress,
   as having a reference to Sennacherib; that is, that God had taken him
   away and made him like mist to disappear. We also said, that some
   elicit this meaning, -- that Sennacherib ascended into Judea and filled
   the whole country with terror, and that he had at length laid it wholly
   waste. But I am disposed to take their view, who think that this is
   said of Nebuchodonosor, the waster of Nineveh: as he had been raised up
   by God to overturn the tyranny of that city, the Prophet ridicules all
   the efforts and preparations made by the Ninevites (as it is usual when
   a country is invaded) to oppose him. He therefore says, guard the
   fortress, watch the way, confirm the loins, and strengthen thy courage
   greatly But these are ironical expressions; as though he said, Whatever
   the Ninevites may contrive to defend themselves against the assault of
   their enemies will be all in vain. [223]

   What is now subjoined has been added, in my view, in reference to what
   had already taken place, that is that God had taken away the pride of
   Jacob, as the pride of Israel Some give this rendering, "God has made
   to returns or to rest;" and they take g'vn, gaun, in a good sense, as
   meaning courage or glory. The sense, according to these, would be, --
   that God, having routed the army of Sennacherib, or destroyed the
   Assyrians, would make the ancient glory of his people to return; for
   both kingdoms had fallen. They then understand this to have been said
   respecting the restoration of the whole people; and they who translate,
   "he will make to rest," think that continual peace is here promised to
   the Israelites, as well as to the Jews. But, on the contrary, it
   appears to me, that the Prophet shows, that it was the ripened time for
   the destruction of the city Nineveh, for God had now humbled his
   people. He had then taken away the pride of Jacob, as the pride of
   Israel; that is, God, having first corrected the pride of Israel, had
   also applied the same remedy to Judah: thus the whole people were
   humbled, and had left off their extreme height; for g'vn, gaun, for the
   most part, is taken in a bad sense, for haughtiness or pride. This then
   is the reason why God now declares, that the ruin of Nineveh was nigh
   at hand; it was so, because the Jews and the Israelites had been
   sufficiently brought down. This sense is the most suitable.

   And then for the same purpose is the next clause, -- that the emptiers
   had emptied, that is that robbers had pillaged them, and left nothing
   to remain for them. There is a passage in Isaiah which corresponds with
   this, where it is said, -- that when the Lord had completed his work on
   mount Zion and in Jerusalem, he would then turn his vengeance against
   the Assyrians, (Isaiah 10:12:) but why were they not sooner destroyed?
   Because the Lord designed to employ them for the purpose of chastising
   the Jews. Until then the whole work of God was completed, that is,
   until he had so corrected their pride, as wholly to cast it down, it
   was not his purpose to destroy the Ninevites; but they were at length
   visited with destruction. The same thing does our Prophet now teach us
   here, -- that Nebuchodonosor would come to demolish Nineveh, when the
   Lord had taken away the haughtiness of his people. [224]

   What follows, And teeps ease destropsed teeir seoots, or their
   branches, I take metaphorically, because the Israelites, as to outward
   appearances had been pulled up by the roots; for before the eyes of
   their enemies they were reduced to nothing, and their very roots were
   torn ups so that they perceived nothing left. The Lord indeed always
   preserved a hidden remnant; but this was done beyond the perceptions of
   men. But what the Prophet says metaphorically of the ruined branches,
   is to be understood of what was apparent.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [223] That the Babylonian power is meant by "the destroyer," or
   disperser, or scatterer, is the opinion if Jerome, Drusius, Grotius,
   Marckius, and Newcome. But Kimchi, Dathius, Henderson, and some others,
   regard the "destroyer" as the king of Assyria. What agrees best with
   the context is the former opinion. Having in the preceding verse
   announced the release of the people of Israel from the rule of Assyria,
   the Prophet now introduces its destroyer, and then proceeds with the
   main object of his prophecy, and describes the fall of Nineveh.
   Marckius considers the whole verse as addressed to the Babylonian power
   under the person of the king, while Calvin regards it, with the
   exception of the first line or clause, as addressed ironically to
   Nineveh. The verbs are either participles or preterites indicative; but
   they are construed by the former as gerunds; most of them imperatives.
   ntsvr is rendered as a passive participle by the Septuagint, and so it
   appears to be, and the three which follow, as imperatives. But in two
   copies it is without the v; then all the verbs in the verse appear to
   be in the same form, and may be considered to be either preterites
   indicative or participles; and participles are often used in Hebrew to
   express the present tense: and the Prophet may be considered as seeing
   the Babylonian ascending and laying siege to Nineveh, for mtsvrh means
   a siege as well as a fortress: then the rendering would be as follows,
   -- Ascend does the waster before thee;
   He watches the siege, guards the way,
   Makes firm the loins, exerts strength mightily. But if "fortress" be
   preferred to "siege," it may be adopted consistently with the context.
   -- Ed.

   [224] Drusius confessed that he did not understand this verse. The view
   given of it by Calvin seems plain, and Marckius has taken the same view
   of it: but Newcome, as well as Henderson, differ widely, and give a
   rendering which seems not to comport with the context. It is like that
   of Drusius, which no doubt made him to say that he did not understand
   the passage. For Jehovah restoreth the excellency of Jacob
   As the excellency of Israel. In this connection, this can have no
   meaning. The version of Henderson is the same, only he puts the verb in
   the future tense. The verb sv has the meaning of turning away, as well
   as of restoring, and Marckius renders it avertit, he turned away. Then
   g'vn, rising, swelling, elatio, is more commonly taken in a bad than in
   a good sense, as meaning pride, haughtiness. The latter part of the
   verse sets before us distinctly the means which had been adopted to
   take away this pride. The passage is evidently parenthetic. -- Ed.

   Nahum 2:3

   3. The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in
   scarlet: the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his
   preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.

   3. Clypeus fortium ejus rubefactus est, viri potentiae ejus vermiculati
   (hoc est, rubro etiam colore;) in igne lampadum (vel, taedarum) currus
   in die expeditionis ejus, et abietes tremefactae sunt.


   The Prophet describes here how dreadful the Chaldeans would be when
   prepared against the Assyrians. He says, The shield of his brave men
   [225] is made red Some think that their shields were painted red, that
   blood might not appear; and that the soldiers had on red garments, that
   they might not be frightened in case they were wounded; and this is
   what history records of the Lacedemonians. But as the habits of these
   nations are not much known to us, it is enough for us to know, that
   their warlike appearance is here described; as though he had said, that
   the Chaldeans would come against Nineveh with violent and terrible
   power. Hence he says, that the men of his strength [226] would be clad
   in scarlet; he refers no doubt to the color of their dress. Some
   expound this of the Assyrians, and say that their shame is here
   designated; but this is too strained. The Prophet, I have no doubt,
   describes here the Chaldeans, and shows that they would be so armed
   that even their very appearance would put to flight their enemies, that
   is, the Assyrians.

   For the same purpose he afterwards adds, With fire of torches, [227] or
   lamps, is the chariot in the day of his expedition. The word phldvt,
   peladut, occurs nowhere else; and the Jews think that the letters are
   inverted, and that it should be lphydvt, as this word is afterwards
   used by the Prophet in the next verse, and in the same sense. It is
   certainly evident from the context that either torches or lamps are
   meant by the Prophet. His chariot then is with the fire of lamps, that
   is, his chariots drive so impetuously that they appear as flames of
   fire, when wheels roll with such velocity.

   And the fir-trees, he says, are terrible shaken Some translate, "are
   inebriated" or, "stunned;" and they apply this to the Assyrians, --
   that their great men (whom they think are here compared to fir-trees,
   or are metaphorically designated by them) were stunned through
   amazement. Astonished then shall be the principal men among the
   Assyrians; for the very sight of their enemies would render them, as it
   were, lifeless; for the verb rl, rol, is taken by some in the sense of
   infecting with poison, or of stupefying. But their opinion is more
   correct who think that fir-trees are to be taken for lances, though
   they do not sufficiently express the meaning of the Prophet; for he
   means, I have no doubt, that such would be the concussion among the
   lances, that it would be like that of fir-trees, tossed here and there
   in the forest. For lances, we know, are made of fir-trees, because it
   is a light wood and flexible, as when any one says in our language, les
   lances branslent. The lances then trembled, or shook in the hands of
   the soldiers, as fir-trees shake. Thus we see that the Prophet here
   continues to describe the terrible appearance of the Chaldeans. Let us
   go on --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [225] gvvryhv, of his heroes, -- "heroum." -- Dathius.

   [226] 'nsy-chyl, men of war, -- "warriors," Henderson; "the valiant
   men." -- Newcome.

   [227] The most satisfactory explanation of this word is what is offered
   by Parkhurst, and adopted by Henderson. He says that phld, in Arabic,
   is to cut, or cut in pieces, and that phldvt may have been the scythes
   or cutting instruments with which the chariots were armed. Then in
   eight or nine MSS. The v, beth, before 's, is k, caph. If this reading
   be adopted, and the poetical singular number be retained as to the word
   chariot, the clause may be thus translated: -- Like fire are the
   scythes of the chariot,
   In the day of his preparation. To which shall be added the line which
   follows, -- And the fir-trees (spears) tremulously shake. Fir-trees are
   rendered "cypresses" by Henderson; and Newcome, following the
   Septuagint, changes to the word into what signifies "horsemen." The
   figure is bold, but it is no unusual thing in poetry to call an
   instrument by the name of the material of which it is made. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Nahum 2:4

   4. The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one
   against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they
   shall run like the lightnings.

   4. In compitis insanient per currus (est hic nomen singulare, currus,
   ideo quidam subaudiunt viros currus, sed possumus aliter intelligere,
   quod insaninient in suis curribus; diende) properabunt in plateis (alii
   vertunt, congregabuntur; potest deduci tam a sqq, quam in svq, sed hic
   significat properare;) aspectus eorum quasi lampades (hoc est,
   lampadum,) quasi fulgura discurrent.


   He still goes on with the same subject, -- that they shall be furious
   in the streets that is, that they shall he so turbulent, as though they
   were out of their minds: as furious men are wont to be who are
   impetuously carried away beyond all reason and moderation, so shall
   they also become mad in their tumult. He then says, They shall hasten.
   The verb is derived from the hips; for he who hastens shakes the hips,
   and moves them with a quick motion; and if it be lawful to coin a word,
   it is, they shall hip; Ils remueront les hanches. This is what the
   Prophet meant. And then, Their appearance [228] shall be as lamps. He
   refers here to the chariots. They shall then be like lamps; that is
   they shall dazzle the eyes of beholders with their brightness. All
   these things are intended to set forth what is terrific. He says also,
   as lightning they shall run here and there.

   In short, he intimates, that the impetuosity of the Chaldeans would be
   so violent as to surpass what is commonly witnessed among men, that it
   would be, as it were, a species of fury and madness sent down from
   above. Thus, then, they were to be like lightning and flames of fire,
   that they might exceed every thing human. But these forms of speech,
   though they are hyperbolical, were not yet used without reason; for we
   may easily conjecture how great was then the security of the city
   Nineveh, and how incredible was the event of its ruin. That monarchy
   was then preeminent over every other in the whole world, and no one
   could have thought that it could ever be assailed. Since then it was
   difficult to persuade the Jews that ruin was nigh the Assyrians, it was
   necessary for the Prophet to accumulate these various forms of
   expressions, by which he sets forth the power of God in the destruction
   of the Assyrians. It afterwards follows --

   Nahum 2:5

   5. He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk;
   they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be
   prepared.

   5. Recordabitur fortium suorum, impingent in itinere suo (vel,
   itineribus suis, si legamus plurali numero;) festinabunt ad murum ejus,
   parabitur integumentum.


   Some interpreters explain this also of the Chaldeans: The king of
   Babylon then shall remember his mighty men; that is, shall recount his
   forces and whatever strength he will have under his power; all this he
   will collect to make war with Nineveh and the Assyrians. Others think
   that there is here a transposition in the words, (which is too
   strained,) "Mighty men shall remember," as though it were a change of
   number. But I take the words of the Prophet simply as they are, -- that
   he will remember mighty men: but this, as I think, refers to the
   Assyrians. He then, that is, either the king of Nineveh, or the people,
   will remember the mighty men; that is, he will gather from every
   quarter his forces and will omit nothing which may avail for defense;
   as it is usually done in great danger and in extremities: for they were
   noted then as warlike men; and every one who had any skill, every one
   who was endued with courage, every one who was trained up in arms, all
   these were mustered, that they might give help. So then the Prophet
   says, that such would be the dread in the land of Assyria, that they
   would collect together whatever force they had, to defend themselves
   against their enemies. The king then shall remember his mighty men,
   that is, he will muster all the subsidies within his reach.

   Then he says, They shall stumble in their march; that is, the mighty
   men, when gathered, shall tremble and stumble like the blind: and this
   will be occasioned by fear; so that like men astounded, they will move
   to and fro, and have no certain footing. The Prophet then declares here
   two things, that the Assyrians would be diligent in gathering forces to
   repel the assault of their enemies, -- but that yet they would effect
   nothing, for trembling would seize the minds of all, so that mighty men
   would stumble in their marches. They shall stumble, and then it is
   said, they shall hasten to its wall, that is, they shall ascend the
   wall; and it is added, Prepared shall be the covering, as it is usual
   in defending cities. Some apply this to the Chaldeans; prepared shall
   be the covering, that is, when they shall come to the wall. It was
   indeed usual, as it is well known from histories, for those who
   approached a wall to defend themselves either with turrets or hurdles.
   But the Prophet, I doubt not, intimates, that the Assyrians would come
   with great trembling to meet their enemies, but without any success.
   However then they might defend themselves, their enemies would yet
   prevail. [229] He therefore subjoins --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [229] This verse is applied by Grotius and Newcome to the Babylonian
   and not to the Assyrian king. The last clause seems to favor this
   opinion, but the second, the other. To render ykslv as a Hiphil, "They
   cast down," without an objective case, cannot be approved; but they may
   have been said to "stumble," as the word means, from their great haste,
   afterwards mentioned. Piscator, Marckius, and Henderson, agree in the
   view given here. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Nahum 2:6

   6. The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be
   dissolved.

   6. Portae fluviorum apertae sunt, et palatium solutum est.


   By the gates of the rivers the Prophet means that part of the city
   which was most fortified by the river Tigris; for the Tigris flowed
   close by the city. As then the Tigris was like the strongest defense,
   (for we know it to have been a most rapid river,) the Prophet ridicules
   the confidence of the Ninevites, who thought that the access of enemies
   could be wholly prevented in that part where the Tigris flowed. The
   gates then of the rivers are opened; that is, your river shall not
   prevent your enemies from breaking through and penetrating into your
   city.

   We hence see, that the Prophet removes all the hindrances which might
   have seemed available to keep off enemies; and he did so, not so much
   for the sake of Nineveh as for the sake of his chosen people, that the
   Israelites and Jews might know, that that city was no less in the power
   of God than any other; for God can no less easily pass through rivers
   than go along the plain, where there is no obstacle. We now see why the
   Prophet says, that the gates of the rivers were opened: and then he
   adds, The palace is dissolved; that is, there will be no impediment to
   prevent the approach of enemies; for all the fortresses will melt away,
   and that of themselves, as though they were walls of paper, and the
   stones, as though they were water. He afterwards adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Nahum 2:7

   7. And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and
   her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves, tabering upon
   their breasts.

   7. Et quae stabat solida (vel, firma) ejecta est in exilium (vel, quae
   stabat occulta, patefacta est, jussa est ascendere;) et ancillae ejus
   ducentes tanquam in voce columbarum, plangentes super pectora sua.


   There is some ambiguity in these words, and many interpreters think
   that htsv, estab, to be the name of the queen. The queen then they say,
   of the name of htsv, estab, is drawn away into exile; she is bidden to
   ascend, that she might migrate to a hostile land. But this view is too
   strained; nor was there any reason to suppose the word to be a proper
   name, except that there was a wish to say something, and that there was
   no other conjecture more probable. But I regard their opinion more
   correct, who refer this to the state of the kingdom; and there is here,
   I have no doubt, a personification, which is evident if we attend to
   the meaning. If any one prefers to regard the queen as intended, it
   would yet be better to take htsv, estab, in its proper and real
   meaning, -- that the queen, previously hid in her palace, and hardly
   able, through being so delicate, to move a step, -- that she was
   brought forth to the light; for glh, gele, means to uncover, and also
   to cast out. If we render it, was made manifest, the Prophet alludes to
   hiding-places, and means that the queen did not go forth to the light,
   but was like delicate women who keep themselves within their chambers:
   but if we render it, Who is drawn forth into exile, it would be more
   suitable to one who was previously fixed in her dwelling. The word
   comes from ytsv, itsab, to stand; but it is here in Hophal, hvtsv,
   eustab,: it then signifies one who was before fixed and firmly settled,
   that is, in her concealment; she is drawn, he says, into exile. If then
   any one chooses to refer this to the person of the queen, the most
   suitable meaning would be, -- that the queen, who before sat in the
   midst of her pleasures, shall be violently drawn into exile, and
   carried away to another country. And it is probable that the Prophet
   speaks of the queen, because it immediately follows, Her handmaids lead
   her as with the voice of doves, and smite on their breasts; that is,
   her maids, who before flattered her, shall laments and with sighing and
   tears, and mourning, shall lead away, as a captive, their own mistress.
   Thus the context would harmonize.

   But, as I have said, their opinion seems right, who think that under
   the person of a woman the state of the kingdom is here described. She
   then, who before stood, or remained fixed, shall be drawn into
   captivity; or she, who before sat at leisure, shall be discovered; that
   is, she shall no more lie hid as hitherto in her retirement, but shall
   be forced to come abroad. And then, she shall ascend; that is, vanish
   away, for the verb is to be here taken metaphorically; she shall then
   vanish away, or be reduced to nothing. And as the Prophet sets a woman
   here before us, what follows agrees with this idea, -- Her handmaids
   shall weep and imitate the doves in their moaning; that is, the whole
   people shall bewail the fate of the kingdom, when things shall be so
   changed, as when handmaids lead forth their own mistress, who had been
   before nourished in the greatest delicacies. [230]

   Now this accumulation of words was by no means in vain; for it was
   necessary to confirm, by many words, the faith of the Israelites and of
   the Jews respecting the near approach of the destruction of the city
   Nineveh, which would have been otherwise incredible; and of this we can
   easily form a judgment by our own experience. If any one at this day
   were to speak of mighty kings, whose splendor amazes the whole world,
   -- if any one were to announce the ruin of the kingdom of one of them,
   it would appear like a fable. This then is the reason why the Prophet,
   by so many figures, sets forth an event which might have been expressed
   in few words, and confirms it by so many forms of speech, and even by
   such as are hyperbolical. He at length subjoins --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [230] Various have been the opinions respecting the construction of
   this verse. The Rabbins have generally considered the first word as the
   name of the queen of Nineveh: but this opinion has been adopted but by
   a few. Newcome joins the word with the last verse, and changes it into
   mtsv, on no authority but that of conjecture, and renders it
   "fortress." What Henderson has adopted seems the best: he also joins it
   to the last verse, but makes no change in it, only he gives the v an
   adversative meaning, which it often has. The evident gender, as he
   rightly says, of htsv proves its connection with the former verse, it
   being masculine, while the verbs in this verse are feminines. His
   version of the two verses is the following, -- 7. The floodgates are
   opened,
   And the palace is dissolved,
   Though firmly established. 8. She is made bare, she is carried up,
   While her handmaids moan like doves,
   And smite upon their hearts. With the exception of the word htsv, this
   version is liable to several objections. The verb glh is often used in
   Kal intransitively, "is removed;" and this meaning enables us better to
   understand that of the next verb, "she is made to ascend," that is,
   into captivity, even into Babylon, the seat of empire, being ever
   considered as the highest place. mnhgvt is a word which in some form or
   another often occurs in Hebrew, and has never the meaning here given to
   it. Here it is a participle in Hophal, and "carried away" is its
   evident meaning, and is rendered egonto, led away, by the Septuagint.
   "Like," or, as "the voice of doves," are literally the words which
   follow this verb. However connected, they must be considered as
   elliptical -- "as with the voice, or, with a voice as that of doves."
   They might then be construed with the next line. The whole verse would
   then be this, -- She is removed, she is made to ascend;
   Yea, her handmaids are led away,
   Who with a voice as that of doves, tabor on their breasts. They were
   accompanying the tabering with a voice like that of doves. "Tabor" is
   literally the original, and "on their breasts" is an English idiom, as
   "on their hearts" is a Hebrew idiom. -- Ed.

   Nahum 2:8

   8. But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee
   away. Stand, stand, shall they cry; but none shall look back.

   8. Atqui Nineveh quasi piscina aquarum a diebus (hoc est, a longo
   tempore) fuit; ipsi autem fugiunt; state, state; et nemo respicit.


   The prophet here anticipates a doubt which might have weakened
   confidence in his words; for Nineveh not only flourished in power, but
   it had also confirmed its strength during a long course of time; and
   antiquity not only adds to the strength of kingdoms, but secures
   authority to them. As then the imperial power of the city Nineveh was
   ancient, it might seem to have been perpetual: "Why! Nineveh has ever
   ruled and possessed the sovereign power in all the east; can it be now
   shaken, or can its strength be now suddenly subverted? For where there
   is no beginning, we cannot believe that there will be any end." And a
   beginning it had not, according to the common opinion; for we know how
   the Egyptians also fabled respecting their antiquity; they imagined
   that their kingdom was five thousand years before the world was made;
   that is, in numbering their ages they went back nearly five thousand
   years before the creation. The Ninevites, no doubt, boasted that they
   had ever been; and as they were fixed in this conceit respecting their
   antiquity, no one thought that they could ever fail. This is the reason
   why the Prophet expressly declares, that Nineveh had been like a pool
   of waters from ancient days; [231] that is, Nineveh had been, as it
   were, separated from the rest of the world; for where there is a pool,
   it seems well fortified by its own banks, no one comes into it; when
   one walks on the land he does not enter into the waters. Thus, then,
   had Nineveh been in a quiet state not only for a short time, but for
   many ages. This circumstance shall not, however, prevent God from
   overturning now its dominion. How much soever, then, Nineveh took pride
   in the notion of its ancientness, it was yet God's purpose to destroy
   it.

   He says then, They flee: by fleeing, he means, that, though not beaten
   by their enemies, they would yet be overcome by their own fear. He then
   intimates, that Nineveh would not only be destroyed by slaughter, but
   that all the Assyrians would flee away, and despair would deliver them
   up to their enemies. Hence the Chaldeans would not only be victorious
   through their courage and the sword, but the Assyrians, distrusting
   their own forces, would flee away.

   It afterwards follows, Stand ye, stand ye, and no one regards. Here the
   Prophet places, as it were, before our eyes, the effect of the dread of
   which he speaks. He might have given a single narrative, -- that though
   one called them back they would not dare to look behind; and that,
   thinking that safety alone was in flight, they would pursue their
   course. The Prophet might have formed this sort of narrative: this he
   has not done; but he assumes the person of one calling back the
   fugitives, as though he saw them fleeing away, and tried to bring them
   back: No one, he says, regards We now see what the Prophet meant.

   But from this passage we ought to learn that no trust is to be put in
   the number of men, nor in the defenses and strongholds of cities, nor
   in ancientness; for when men excel in power, God will hence take
   occasion to destroy them, inasmuch as pride is almost ever connected
   with strength. It can hardly be but that men arrogate too much to
   themselves when they think that they excel in any thing. Thus it
   happens, that on account of their strength they run headlong into ruin;
   not that God has any delight, as profane men imagine, when he turns
   upside down the face of the earth, but because men cannot bear their
   own success, nor keep themselves within moderate bounds, but many
   triumph against God: hence it is that human power recoils on the head
   of those who possess it. The same things must also be said of
   ancientness: for they who boast of their antiquity, know not for how
   long a time they have been provoking the wrath of God; for it cannot be
   otherwise but that abundance of itself generates licentiousness, or
   that it at least leads to excess; and further, they who are the most
   powerful are the most daring in corrupting others. Hence the increase
   at putridity; for men are like the dead when not ruled by the fear of
   God. A dead body becomes more and more fetid the longer it continues
   putrifying; and so it is with men. When they have been for a long time
   sinning, and still continue to sin, the fetidness of their sins
   increases, and the wrath of God is more and more provoked. There is
   then no reason why ancientness should deceive us. And if, at any time,
   we are tempted to think that men are sufficiently fortified by their
   own strength, or by numerous auxiliaries, or that they are, as it were
   sacred through their own ancientness, let what is said here come to our
   minds, -- that Nineveh had been like a pool of waters from the ancient
   days; but that, when it was given up to destruction, it fled away; and
   that, when their enemies did not rout them, they yet, being driven by
   their own fear, ran away and would not stop, though one called them to
   return.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [231] The original is in a singular form, mymy hy', "from the days of
   it," or, of her. Henderson says, that "it is an antiquated mode of
   expressing the feminine pronominal affix -- the absolute form of the
   pronoun being retained instead of the fragmental h." The verse may be
   thus rendered: -- Though Nineveh has been like a pool of water during
   her days,
   Yet they flee; -- -- "Stand, stand;"
   But none is looking back. Newcome's version of the first line is as
   follows, -- And the waters of Nineveh are as a pool of water: And he
   says, that the pronoun sometimes is at the end of a clause: but it
   cannot be so considered here, because hy' is in regimine with mymy It
   is to be noticed, that the Prophet throughout represents the whole
   transaction as an eye-witness, as it had been shown to him in a vision.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou constantly remindest us, in thy word,
   and teachest us by so many examples, that there is nothing permanent in
   this world, but that the things which seem the firmest tend to ruin,
   and instantly fall and of themselves vanish away, when by thy breath
   thou shakest that strength in which men trust, -- O grant, that we
   being really subdued and humbled, may not rely on earthly things, but
   raise up our hearts and our thoughts to heaven, and there fix the
   anchor of our hope; and may all our thoughts abide there, and at
   length, when thou hast led us through our course on earth we shall be
   gathered into that celestial kingdom, which has been obtained for us by
   the blood of thy only-begotten Son. Amen.

   Nahum 2:9

   9. Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for there is
   none end of the store and glory out of all the pleasant furniture.

   9. Diripite argentum, diripite aurum; et non finis (quia non est,
   copula debet resolvi in causalem particulam; quia nullus finis)
   praeparationis ejus (sic vertunt, sed proprie tkvnh significat locum;)
   gloria ex omni vase desiderabili.


   Here the Prophet, as it were, by the command and authority of God,
   gives up Nineveh to the will of its enemies, that they might spoil and
   plunder it. Some think that this address is made in the name of a
   general encouraging his soldiers; but we know that the Prophets assume
   the person of God, when they thus command any thing with authority; and
   it is a very emphatical mode of speaking. It is adopted, that we may
   know that the Prophets pour not forth an empty sound when they speak,
   but really testify what God here determined to do, and what he in due
   time will execute. As then we know, that this manner of speaking is
   common to the Prophets there is no reason to apply this to the person
   of Nebuchadnezzar or of any other. God then shows here that Nineveh was
   given up to ruin; and therefore he delivered it into the hands of
   enemies.

   It is indeed certain, that the Babylonians, in plundering the city, did
   not obey God's command; but yet it is true, that they punished the
   Assyrians through the secret influence of God: for it was his purpose
   to visit the Ninevites for the cruelty and avarice for which they had
   been long notorious, and especially for having exercised unexampled
   barbarity toward the Jews. This is the reason why God now gives them up
   to the Babylonians and exposes them to plunder. But as I have spoken at
   large elsewhere of the secret judgments of God, I shall only briefly
   observe here, -- that God does not command the Babylonians and
   Chaldeans in order to render them excusable, but shows by his Prophet,
   that Nineveh was to be destroyed by her enemies, not by chance, but
   that it was his will to avenge the wrongs done to his people. At the
   same time, we must bear in mind what we have said elsewhere, -- that
   the Prophets thus speak when the execution is already prepared; for God
   does not in vain or without reason terrify men, but he afterwards makes
   it manifest by the effect: as he created the world from nothing by his
   word, so also by his word he executes and fulfill his judgments. It is
   then no wonder, that the Prophet does here, as though he ruled the
   Chaldeans according to his will, thus address them, Take ye away, take
   ye away But this must be viewed as having a reference to the faithful;
   for the Babylonians, in plundering the city Nineveh, did not think that
   they obeyed God, nor did they give to God the praise due for the
   victory; but the faithful were thus reminded, that all this was done
   through the secret providence of God, and that it was also a clear,
   and, as it were, a visible evidence of God's paternal love towards his
   Church, when he thus deigned to undertake the cause of his distressed
   people.

   It then follows, There is no end of preparations: Some render tkvnh,
   techune, treasure, or hidden wealth, and derive it from kvn, cun, which
   is to prepare; but tkvnh, tacune, is almost always taken for a measure.
   tknvt, tacanut, from tkvn, tacun means a sum, for tks, tacan, is to
   number or to count; and this meaning suits the passage. [232] But there
   is no need of laboring much about this word; if we take it simply for
   place, the meaning would be, that there was no plot of ground in that
   city which was not as it were a gulf filled up; for it had amassed all
   the wealth of the nations: and this sense would harmonize well with the
   subject of the Prophet, -- that the soldiers were to plunder until they
   were satiated; for the place was, as it were, a deep abyss.

   He afterwards adds, There is glory from every desirable vessel. Those
   who think m, mem, a particle of comparison in this place are much
   mistaken, and misapply the meaning of the Prophet; their rendering is,
   In comparison with every desirable vessel; but this, as all must see,
   is very frigid. The Prophet, I have no doubt, declares that the wealth
   of Nineveh consisted of every desirable vessel; for they had for a long
   time heaped together immense wealth, and that of every kind. The
   Hebrews call what is precious a desirable thing; and their vessels we
   include under the term furniture. We now then perceive what the Prophet
   means. Some take kvd, cabed, as a participle, and give this version, It
   is burdened, or adorned, (for it means both,) with every desirable
   vessel. But the simpler mode of speaking is what we have explained, --
   that its glory was from every desirable vessel.

   And here the Prophet condemns what the Assyrians had done in heaping
   together so much wealth from all quarters; for they had committed
   indiscriminate plunder, and gathered for themselves all the riches of
   the nations. They had indeed plundered all their neighbors, yea, and
   wholly stripped them. The Prophet now shows, in order to expose them to
   ridicule, that other robbers would be made rich, whom the Lord would
   raise up against them. The same is said by Isaiah,

   O thou plunderer, shalt not thou also be exposed to plunder?' (Isaiah
   33.)

   So also the Prophet shows in this passage, that men foolishly burn with
   so much avidity for money, and with so much anxiety heap together great
   wealth; for God will find out some who in their turn will plunder those
   who have plundered. It follows--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [232] Buxtorf derives the word from kvn, to prepare, and Parkhurst from
   tkn, to regulate, to measure. It is rendered "store" by Newcome and
   Henderson. What is meant is evidently the vast treasure amassed by the
   Assyrians. The next words are more variously rendered. Newcome connects
   the word kvd with "store," and renders the two lines thus, -- And there
   is no end of the glorious store,
   Because of all kinds of pleasant vessels. But more consistent with the
   character of the language, and agreeably to what Dr. Wheeler suggests,
   is this, -- And there is no end to her store,
   It is more precious than all desirable vessels. The preposition m,
   after kvd, may be viewed as the comparative degree. -- Ed.

   Nahum 2:10

   10. She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the
   knees smite together, and much pain is in all loins, and the faces of
   them all gather blackness.

   10. Exinanita etexinanita est, et nudata; et cor liquefactum, et
   collisio genuum, et terror in omnibus lumbis; et facies omnium
   contraxerunt nigredinem (vel, splendorem, ut alii vertunt.)


   The Prophet here confirms what the last verse contains; for he shows
   why he had called the Chaldeans to take away the spoil, -- because it
   was to be so. He did not indeed (as I have already said) command the
   Chaldeans in such a way as that their obedience to God was
   praiseworthy: but the Prophet speaks here only of His secret counsel.
   Though then the Chaldeans knew not that it was God's decree, yet the
   Prophet reminds the faithful that the Ninevites, when made naked,
   suffered punishment for their cruelty, especially for having so
   hostilely conducted themselves towards the Jews: and hence he declares,
   that Nineveh is emptied, is emptied, and made naked. [233] By repeating
   the same word, he intimates the certainty of the event: Emptied,
   emptied, he says, as when one says in our language, videe et revidee We
   hence see that by this repetition what the Prophet meant is more
   distinctly expressed that the faithful might not doubt respecting the
   event: and then for the same purpose he adds, she is made naked.

   We now then perceive the Prophet's design. As in the last verse he
   shows that he had power given him from above to send armies against
   Nineveh, and to give up the city to them to be spoiled and plundered;
   so he now shows that he had not so commanded the Chaldeans, as though
   they were the legitimate servants of God, and could pretend that they
   rendered service to Him. He therefore points out for what end he had
   commanded the Chaldeans to plunder Nineveh; and that was, because God
   had so decreed; and he had so decreed and commanded, because he would
   not bear the many wrongs done to his people whom he had taken under his
   protection. As then Nineveh had so cruelly treated God's chosen people,
   it was necessary that the reward she deserved should be repaid to her.
   But the repetition, which I have noticed, ought to be especially
   observed; for it teaches us that God's power is connected with his
   word, so that he declares nothing inconsiderately or in vain.

   He then adds, that knees smite together; and every heart is dissolved,
   or melted, and also, that all loins tremble We hence learn, that there
   is in men no courage, except as far as God supplies them with vigor. As
   soon then as He withdraws his Spirit, those who were before the most
   valiant become faint-hearted, and those who breathed great ferocity are
   made soft and effeminate: for by the word heart is meant inward
   boldness or courage; and by the knees and loins the strength of body is
   to be understood. There is indeed no doubt but the Assyrians, while
   they ruled, were a very courageous people, as power ever generates
   boldness; and it is also probable that they were a warlike people,
   since all their neighbors had been brought under their power. But the
   Prophet now shows, that there would be no vigor in their hearts, and no
   strength in their loins, or in any part of their body. The heart, then,
   he says, is melted And hence we learn how foolishly men boast of their
   courage, while they seem to be like lions; for God can in a moment so
   melt their hearts, that they entirely lose all firmness. Then as to
   external vigor, we see that it is in God's hand; there will be, he
   says, a confriction, or the knees will knock one against another, as
   they do when they tremble. And he says afterwards, And trembling shall
   be in all loins [234] He at last adds, And the faces of all shall
   gather blackness The word ph'rvr, parur, some derive from ph'r, par;
   and so the rendering would be, "all faces shall draw in or withdraw
   their beauty," and so also they explain Joel 2:6, for the sentence
   there is the same. But they who disapprove of this meaning say, that
   qvph, kobets, cannot mean to draw in or to withdraw; and so they render
   the noun, blackness. But this is a strained explanation. ph'rvr, parur,
   [they say,] does not mean a black color but a pot: when therefore a
   caldron or a kettle contracts blackness from smoke, it is then called
   ph'rvr, parur: but in this place these interpreters are constrained to
   take it metaphorically for that color; which is, as I have said,
   strained and far-fetched. I am therefore inclined to adopt their
   opinion who render the sentence, all faces shall withdraw their beauty,
   or their brightness: but as to the import of the passage, there is
   little or no difference; let then every one have his free choice. [235]
   With regard to the Prophet's design, he evidently means, that the faces
   of all would be sad, for the Lord would fill their minds and thoughts
   with dread. The withdrawing then of beauty signifies an outward
   appearance of sorrow, or paleness, or whatever may appear in the
   countenance of men, when dejected with grief. In short, the Prophet
   means, that how much soever the Assyrians might have hitherto raised on
   high their crests, and breathed great swelling words, and conducted
   themselves insolently, they would now be dejected; for the Lord would
   prostrate their courage and melt their strength: he would, by casting
   down their high spirits, constrain them to undergo shame. This is the
   import of the whole. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [233] The three words in Hebrew form a very striking alliteration; and
   they present another peculiarity, -- they increase in length or in
   syllables, somewhat similar to what follows, -- She is made void, and
   empty, and desolate: or, She is empty, and emptied, and desolated. bwqh
   wmbwqh wmblqh Buke, umebuke, umebelake. Some consider the words as
   nouns, but they are evidently participles. -- Ed.

   [234] These three lines are literally as follows, -- And the heart is
   melted,
   And there is tottering of the knees,
   And anguish in all loins. The word chlchlh is not trembling, but
   violent pain, pang, or anguish as that of a woman in travail. -- Ed.

   [235] Parkhurst and others agree with Calvin, as to the construction of
   this line. The idea adopted seems to have been first suggested by
   Aben-Ezra, as it appears from Marckius, but was strongly opposed by
   Kimchi, and on apparently a good ground -- the meaning of the verb here
   used. qvph, as a verb and as a noun, in all its variations, has
   invariably the idea of collecting or gathering, and in no instance that
   of withdrawing, except as it is said, in this sentence, and in Joel.
   Dathius, Marckius, and Newcome, retain the idea contained in our
   version; and consistent with this is the paraphrase of the clause given
   by the Septuagint, "kai to prosopon (ta prosopa, comp.) panton os
   proskauma chutras -- and the face (or, the faces) of all as the burning
   on the pot." This idea is much more expressive and striking than the
   other. -- Ed.

   Nahum 2:11-12

   11. Where is the dwelling of the lions, and the feeding-place of the
   young lions, where the lion, even the old lion, walked, and the lion's
   whelp, and none made them afraid?

   11. Ubi domicilium leonum, et locus pascui leonibus, quo veniebant leo,
   leo, catulus leonis, et nemo exterrens?

   12. The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled
   for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with
   ravin.

   12. Leo rapiebat quantum sufficeret catulis suis, et strangulabat
   leanis suis, et replebat repina speluncas suas et lustra sua praeda.


   Here the Prophet triumphs over the Assyrians, because they thought that
   the city Nineveh was remote from every danger: as lions, who fear
   nothing, when they are in their dens, draw thither their prey in their
   claws or in their mouths: so also was the case with the Assyrians;
   thinking themselves safe, while Nineveh flourished, they took the
   greater liberty to commit plunders everywhere. For Nineveh was not only
   the receptacle of robbers but was also like a den of lions. And the
   Prophet more fully expresses the barbarous cruelty of the Assyrians by
   comparing them to lions, than if he had simply called them lions. We
   now then see what he means, when he says, Where is the place of lions?
   And he designedly speaks thus of the Assyrians: for no one ever thought
   that they could be touched by even the least injury; the fear of them
   had indeed so seized all men, that of themselves they submitted to the
   Assyrians. As then no one dared to oppose them, the Prophet says,
   Where? as though he had said that though all thought it incredible that
   Nineveh could be overthrown, it would yet thus happen. But he assumes
   the character of one expressing his astonishment, in order to intimate,
   that when the Lord should execute such a judgment, it would be a work
   of wonder, which would fill almost all with amazement. This question
   then proves that those are very foolish who form a judgment of God's
   vengeance, of which the Prophet speaks, according to the appearance of
   things at the time; for the ruin of Nineveh and of that empire was to
   be the incomprehensible work of God, and which was to fill all minds
   with astonishment.

   He says first, Where is the place of lions? The feminine gender is
   indeed here used; but all agree that the Prophet speaks of male lions.
   [236] He then adds, the place of feeding for lions? kphrym, caphrim,
   mean young lions as we shall hereafter see; and 'ryvt, ariut, are old
   lions. He afterwards adds, Where 'ryh, arie came: and then comes lvy',
   labia, which some render, lioness; but lvy', labia, properly means an
   old lion; the Prophet, no doubt, uses it in the next verse in the
   feminine gender for lionesses. I therefore do not deny, but that we may
   fitly render the terms here, lion and lioness; afterwards, and the
   whelp of lions, and none terrifying. He then adds, Seize did the lion
   (the word is 'ryh, arie) for his whelps to satiety, that is,
   sufficiently; and strangle did he for his lionesses, llv'tyv,
   lalabatiu. Here no doubt the Prophet means lionesses; there would
   otherwise be no consistency in the passage. He afterwards says,

   And filled has he with prey his dens and his recesses with ravin; it is
   the same word with a different termination, trph, thereph, and trphh,
   therephe

   Now the repetition, made here by the Prophet, of lion, young lion, and
   lioness, was not without its use; for he meant by this number of words
   to set forth the extreme ferocity of the Assyrians, while they were
   dominant. He no doubt compares their kings, their counselors, and their
   chief men, to lions: and he calls their wives lionesses, and their
   children he calls young lions or whelps of lions. The sum of the whole
   is, that Nineveh had so degenerated in its opulence, that all in power
   were like ferocious wild beasts, destitute of every kind feeling. And I
   wish that this could have only been said of one city and of one
   monarchy! But here, as in a mirror, the Prophet represents to us what
   we at this day observe, and what has always and in all ages been
   observed in great empires; for here great power exists, there great
   licentiousness prevails; and when kings and their counselors become
   once habituated to plunder, there is no end of it; nay, a kind of fury
   is kindled in their hearts, that they seek nothings else but to devour
   and to tear in pieces to rend and to strangle. The Prophet indeed
   wished here to console both the Israelites and the Jews by showing,
   that the injustice of their enemies would not go unpunished: but at the
   same time he intended to show how great, even to the end of the world,
   would be the cruelty of those who would rule tyrannically: and as I
   have said, experience proves, that there are too many like the
   Ninevites. It is indeed unquestionable, that the Prophet does not
   without reason speak so often here of lions and lionesses.

   Hence he says, "Come thither did the lion, the lioness, and the whelp
   of the lion." He means that when justice was sought in that city, it
   was found to be the den of cruel beasts; for the king had put off all
   humanity, as well as his counselors; their wives were also like
   lionesses, and their children and domestics were as young lions or the
   whelps of lions. And cruelty creeps in, somewhat in this manner: When a
   king takes to himself too much liberty, his counselors follow him; and
   then every one follows the common example, as though every thing
   received as a custom was lawful. This is the representation which the
   Prophet in these words sets before us; and we with our own eyes see the
   same things. Then he adds, The lion did tear what sufficed his whelps,
   and strangled for his lionesses; he filled with prey his dens and his
   recesses with plunder. He goes on with the same subject, -- that the
   Assyrians heaped for themselves great wealth by unjust spoils, because
   they had no regard for what was right. The lion, he says, did tear for
   his whelps: as lions accustom their whelps to plunder, and when they
   are not grown enough, so as to be able to attack innocent animals, they
   provide a prey for them, and also bring some to the lionesses; so also,
   as the Prophet informs us, was the case at Nineveh; the habits of all
   men were formed for cruelty by the chief men and the magistrates. By
   the word vdy, bedi, sufficiency, he means not that the Ninevites are
   satisfied with their prey, for they were insatiable; but it rather
   refers to the abundance which they had. And he says, that the lion
   strangled for his lionesses: I wish there were no lionesses to devour
   at this day; but we see that there are some who surpass their husbands
   in boldness and cruelty. But the Prophet says here what is natural, --
   that the lion strangles the prey and gives it afterwards to his
   lionesses. He then adds, that the Ninevites were not satisfied with
   daily rapines, as many robbers live for the day; but he says, that
   their plunder was laid up in store. Hence they filled their secret
   places and dens with their booty and spoils. Still further, though the
   Prophet speaks not here so plainly, as we shall see he does in what
   follows, it is yet certain, that the reason is here given, why God
   visited the Ninevites with so severe a vengeance, and that was, because
   they had ceased to be like men, and had degenerated into savage beasts.
   It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [236] It is better to retain the gender as it is in Hebrew: and this
   makes the passage more consistent, and corresponds better with the
   "feeding-place" in the next line. The recesses of the lionesses and the
   whelps are here mentioned, and in the next verse is stated what the
   lions did for them: -- 11. Where is the haunt of the lionesses,
   And the feeding-place, even that for the whelps,
   Where did go the lion, the lioness, the cub of the lion,
   And none made them afraid? 12. The lion ravined for the supply of his
   cubs,
   And strangled for his lionesses,
   And filled with ravin his dens,
   And his haunts by ravining. "The allegory," says Newcome, "is beyond
   measure beautiful. Where are the inhabitants of Nineveh, who were
   strong and rapacious like lions?" -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Nahum 2:13

   13. Behold, I am against thee, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will burn
   her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions:
   and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy
   messengers shall no more be heard.

   13. Ecce Ego ad te dicit Jehova exercituum, et comburam in fumo currum
   ejus, et leunculos tuos comedet gladius, et excidam e terra praedam
   tuam, et non audietur amplius vox nunciorum tuorum (aut, dentium
   molarium.)


   To give more effect to what he says, the Prophet introduces God here as
   the speaker. Behold, he says, I am against thee He has been hitherto,
   as it were, the herald of God, and in this character gave an
   authoritative command to the Chaldeans to plunder Nineveh: but when God
   himself comes forward, and uses not the mouth of man, but declares
   himself his own decrees, it is much more impressive. This then is the
   reason why God now openly speaks: Behold, I am, he says, against thee.
   We understand the emphatical import of the demonstrative particle,
   Behold; for God, as if awakened from sleep, shows that it will be at
   length his work, to undertake the cause of his people, and also to
   punish the world for its wickedness, Behold, I am against thee, he
   says. We have elsewhere seen a similar mode of speaking; there is
   therefore no need of dwelling on it here.

   I will burn, he says, with smoke her chariots Here by smoke some
   understand a smoky fire; but the Prophet, I think, meant another thing,
   -- that at the first onset God would consume all the chariots of
   Nineveh; as though he had said, that as soon as the flame burst forth,
   it would be all over with all the forces of Nineveh; for by chariots he
   no doubt means all their warlike preparations; and we know that they
   fought then from chariots: as at this day there are employed in wars
   horsemen in armor, so there were then chariots. But the Prophet, by
   taking a part for the whole, includes all warlike forces: I will burn
   then the chariots [237] -- How? By smoke alone, that is as soon as the
   first flame begins to emerge; for the smoke rises before the fire
   appears or gathers strength: in short, the Prophet shows that Nineveh
   would be, as it were, in a moment, reduced to nothing, as soon as it
   pleased God to avenge its wickedness.

   He then adds in the third person, And thy young lions shall the sword
   devour He indeed changes the person here; but the discourse is more
   striking, when God manifests his wrath in abrupt sentences. He had
   said, Behold, I am against thee; then, I will burn her chariots, he now
   hardly deigns to direct his speech to Nineveh; but afterwards he
   returns to her, and thy young lions shall the sword devour Then God, by
   speaking thus in broken sentences, more fully expresses the dreadful
   vengeance which he had determined to execute on the Ninevites. He then
   says, And I will exterminate from the earth thy prey; that is, it will
   not now be allowed thee to go on as usual; for I will put a stop to thy
   inhuman cruelty. Thus prey may be taken for the act itself; or it may
   be fitly explained of the spoils taken from the nations, for the
   Ninevites, by their tyrannical ravening, had everywhere plundered; and
   thus it may be applied to the pillaging of the city. I will then
   exterminate from the land, that is from thy country, those riches which
   have been hitherto heaped together as though a lion had been everywhere
   gathering a prey.

   And heard no more shall be the voice of thy messengers They who
   understand ml'kym, melakim, to be messengers, apply the word to the
   heralds, by whom the Assyrians were wont to proclaim wars on
   neighboring nations. As then they sent here and there their heralds to
   announce war, and as their terrible voice sounded everywhere, the words
   of the Prophet have this meaning given them, -- that God would at
   length produce silence, so that they should not hereafter disturb all
   their neighboring countries with the clamor of war. But as this
   explanation is strained, I am inclined to adopt what others think, --
   that the grinding teeth are here intended. The word is not written, if
   it be taken for messengers, according to grammar; it is ml'kkh,
   melakke; there ought not to have been the h, he at the end, and y, jod,
   ought to have been inserted before the last letter but one: and if it
   be deemed as meaning the king, it ought then to have been written mlkk,
   melkak. All then confess, that the word is not written according to the
   rule of grammar; and as the Persians call the grinders ml'kkh, melakke,
   we may give this version, which well suits the context, No more shall
   be heard the sound of grinders.' For since lions seize the prey with
   their teeth, [238] and also break the bones, and thus make a great
   noise when they tear an animal or a man with their teeth, this
   rendering seems to be the most suitable, Heard no more shall be the
   sound of teeth, that is, heard shall not be the noise made by thy
   teeth; for when thou now tearest thy prey, thy teeth make a noise. No
   more heard then shall the noise from that breaking, or the clashing or
   the crashing of the teeth. But as to the chief point, this is no matter
   of importance.

   The Prophet simply teaches us here that it could not be, but that God
   would at length restrain tyrants; for though he hides himself for a
   time, he yet never forgets the groans of those whom he sees to be
   unjustly afflicted: and particularly when tyrants molest the Church, it
   is proved here by the Prophet that God will at length be a defender;
   and hence we ought to consider well these words, Behold, I am against
   thee For though God addresses these words only to the Assyrians, yet as
   he points out the reasons why he rises up with so much displeasure
   against them, they ought to be extended to all tyrants, and to all who
   exercise cruelty towards distressed and innocent men. But this is more
   clearly expressed in the following verse.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [237] Jerome renders the clause, "Succendam usque ad fumum -- I will
   burn to smoke" the chariots: and the version of Henderson is the same.
   But the most natural supposition is, that smoke here is mentioned
   instead of fire. And so Dathius renders it -- "igni -- with fire." --
   Ed.

   [238] The context undoubtedly favors this rendering. The Septuagint has
   "ta erga soi -- thy works," which cannot consist with the word,
   "voice," which precedes, though Newcome, following the Septuagint,
   renders it, "the fame of thy deeds." There is but one different
   reading, except as to points, and that is, ml'kkm, "their messenger,"
   in two copies, and this comes nearest to the received text of any that
   has been conjectured: and to render "messenger" in the singular number
   comports better with the usual style of the Prophets, than in the
   plural. Perhaps the h may be deemed redundant at the end of the
   sentence; and then it would be literally, "thy messenger," taken in a
   collective sense. -- Ed.

   Chapter 3

   Nahum 3:1

   1. Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies and robbery; the prey
   departeth not;

   1. O urbs sanguinaria! Tota mendacio (vertunt) rapina plena est; non
   recedit praeda (vel, non recedet praeda.)


   The Prophet, as I have said, more clearly expresses here the reason why
   the vengeance of God would be so severe on the Ninevites, -- because
   they had wholly given themselves up to barbarous cruelty; and hence he
   calls it the bloody city. Bloody city! he says. The exclamation is
   emphatical. Though hv, eu, sometimes means Woe; yet it is put here as
   though the Prophet would have constrained Nineveh to undergo its
   punishment, O sanguinary city, then, the whole of it is full of kchs
   cachesh: the word signifies leanness and the Prophet no doubt joins
   here together two words, which seem to differ widely, and yet they
   signify the same thing. For phrq, perek, means to lay by; and kchs,
   cachesh, is taken for a lie or vanity, when there is nothing solid in
   what is said: but the Prophet, I doubt not, means by both words the
   spoils of the city Nineveh. It was then full of leanness for it had
   consumed all others; it was also full of spoils, for it had filled
   itself. But the meaning of the Prophet is in no way dubious; for at
   length he adds, Depart shall not the prey; that is as some think, it
   shall not be withdrawn from the hands of conquerors; but others more
   correctly think that a continued liberty in plundering is intended,
   that the Assyrians were constantly employed in pillaging and kept
   within no bounds.

   We hence see that the Prophet now shows why God says, that he would be
   an adversary to the Ninevites, because he could not endure its unjust
   cruelty. He bore with it indeed for a time; for he did not immediately
   execute his judgment; but yet he never forgot his own people.

   As, then, God has once declared by the mouth of his Prophet that he
   would be the avenger of the cruelty which the Assyrians had exercised,
   let us know that he retains still his own nature; and whatever liberty
   he may for a time grant to tyrants and savage wild beasts, he yet
   continues to be a just avenger. It is our duty calmly to bear injuries,
   and to groan to him; and as he promises to be at length our helper, it
   behaves us to flee to him, and to ask him to succor us, so that seeing
   his Church oppressed, and tyrants exercising licentiously their power,
   he may hasten the time to restrain them. If then we were at all times
   to continue thus resigned under God's protection, there is no doubt but
   that he would be ready even at this day to execute a similar judgment
   to that which the city Nineveh and its people had to endure.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God. that as we have now heard of punishments so
   dreadful denounced on all tyrants and plunderers, this warning may keep
   us within the limits of justice, so that none of us may abuse our power
   to oppress the innocent, but, on the contrary, strive to benefit one
   another, and wholly regulate ourselves according to the rule of equity:
   and may we hence also receive comfort whenever the ungodly molest and
   trouble us, and doubt not but that we are under thy protection, and
   that thou art armed with power sufficient to defend us, so that we may
   patiently bear injuries, until at length the ripened time shall come
   for thee to help us, and to put forth thy power for our preservation;
   nor let us cease to bear our evils with patience, as long as it may be
   thy will to exercise us in our present warfare, until having gone
   through all one troubles, we come to that blessed rest which has been
   provided for us in heaven by Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen.

   Nahum 3:2-3

   2. The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels,
   and of the pransing horses, and of the jumping chariots.

   2. Sonitus flagelli, et sonitus commotionis rotae, et equus concutiens,
   et quadriga exultans;

   3. The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering
   spear: and there is a multitude of slain, and a great number of
   carcases; and there is none end of their corpses; they stumble upon
   their corpses:

   3. Eques ascendere faciens, et flamma gladii, et fulgur lanceae, et
   multitudo occisi (est mutatio numeri, occisorum,) et pondus cadaverum
   (hoc est etiam multitudo,) et nullus finis cadaveribus ejus; impingent
   in cadavera ejus:


   The Prophet represents here as in a lively picture, what was nigh the
   Assyrians; for he sets forth the Chaldeans their enemies, with all
   their preparations and in their quick movements. [239] The sound of the
   whip, he says; the whips, made a noise in exciting the horses: the
   sound of the rattling of the wheel; that is, great shall be the haste
   and celerity, when the horses shall be forced on by the whip; the horse
   also shaking the earth, and the chariot bounding; the horseman making
   it to ascend; and then, the flame of the sword and the lightning of the
   spear He then says, that there would be such a slaughter, that the
   whole place would be full of dead bodies.

   We now then understand what the Prophet means: for as Nineveh might
   have then appeared impregnable the Prophet confirms at large what he
   had said of its approaching ruin, and thus sets before the eyes of the
   Israelites what was then incredible.

   As to the words, some interpreters connect what we have rendered, the
   horseman makes to ascend, with what follows, that is, he makes to
   ascend the flame of the sword and the lightning of the spear But as a
   copulative comes between, it seems rather to be an imperfect sentence,
   meaning, that the horseman makes to ascend or mount, that is, his
   horses, by urging them on. With regard to the word lhv, leb, it means I
   have no doubt, a flame. By this word, I know, is also understood
   metaphorically the brightness of swords, which appears like a flame:
   but the Prophet immediately adds lightning As then he says that spears
   lighten, I doubt not but that for the same reason he meant to say that
   swords flame. All these things were intended for the purpose of fully
   convincing the Israelites that Nineveh, however much it was supplied
   with wealth and power, was yet approaching its ruin, for its enemies
   would prevail against it: and therefore he adds, that all the roads
   would be full of dead bodies, that the enemies could not enter without
   treading on them everywhere. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [239] It appears from Marckius that Theodoret and Cyril regarded this
   verse, with Calvin, as a description of the Chaldean army after having
   invaded Nineveh, but that Jerome and Cocceius viewed it as a
   delineation of the state of Nineveh in the Prophet's time; and with the
   last Newcome agrees, while Henderson coincides with the former. The
   version given by them is all nearly the same. It seems certainly more
   consistent with the order of the poem to regard the verse as describing
   the state of Nineveh at the time, for the sacking of Nineveh had been
   before very minutely delineated. Having done this, the Prophet may be
   supposed to give here a reason for the dreadful catastrophe which he
   had mentioned. Entertaining this view, and differing from others as to
   the meaning of some of the clauses, I offer the following version of
   the three verses, -- 1. Oh! The city of blood! All of deceit;
   Of plunder it is full, none can search out the spoil: -- 2. The sound
   of the whip, and the sound of the rattling wheel!
   And the horse prancing, and the chariot bounding!
   The horseman mounting,
   And the flaming of the sword and the glittering of the spear!
   And a multitude dancing, and a mass inactive!
   And no end to her people!
   Who are fallen, with their nations, 3. Through the many fornications of
   the harlot,
   That exults in beauty, and possesses enchantments;
   Who sells nations by her fornications,
   And tribes by her enchantments. ymys, "search out," I derive from ms,
   which is to feel for the purpose of exploring, and then, to explore or
   search out; see Genesis 31:34. The second verse contains a simple
   enumeration of what the city exhibited. rv chll, "a multitude dancing"
   or piping, the v being dropped in chll, as it is in chllym, pipers, 1
   Kings 1:40. Then as a contrast comes the dead, heavy, inactive mass,
   kvd phgd. "To her people" or nations, lgvyh, tois ethnesin autes. --
   Sept. In the word vnvytm, I take that t is a mistake for h. If taken
   for carcasses, it wants a v before t; see Psalm 110:6. The third verse
   must be connected with the second, as it has otherwise no grammatical
   construction. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Nahum 3:4

   4. Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured
   harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her
   whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.

   4. Ob multitudinem scortationum meretricis pollentis gratia, magistrae
   veneficiorum, vendentis gentes in scortationibus suis, et nationes in
   suis veneficiis.


   The Prophet mentions again the cause why God would execute so dreadful
   a vengeance on that city, which yet procured by its splendor so much
   glory and respect among all people: and God seems in a manner to have
   but little regard for the order of the world when he thus overturns
   great cities. For since he is the Creator of the whole world, it seems
   to be his proper office to protect its various parts, especially those
   which excel in beauty, for they seem to deserve a higher regard. When
   therefore any splendid city is demolished, such thoughts as these occur
   to us, -- That God is either delighted with the ruin of the world, or
   is asleep in heaven, and that thus all things revolve by chance and
   contingency. Therefore the Prophet shows, that God had just reasons for
   decreeing the ruin of Nineveh, and for deforming that beauty, that it
   might not deceive the eyes of men. Hence he compares Nineveh to a
   harlot. The similitude seems not to be very suitable: but yet if we
   take a nearer view of things, the Prophet could not have more fitly nor
   more strikingly set forth the condition of that city. He had before
   mentioned its barbarous cruelty, and said, that it was the den of
   lions, and that savage and bloody wild beasts dwelt there. He now
   begins to speak of the frauds and crafty artifices by which the kings
   of this world attain for themselves both wealth and power. The Prophet
   then makes the city Nineveh to be like a harlot for this reason, --
   because it had not only brought under its power neighboring nations by
   threats and terrors, and also by cruelty, but because it had ensnared
   many by oblique arts and fraudulent means, by captious dealings and
   allurements. This is the reason why it is now called a harlot by the
   Prophet.

   The Prophets of God seem indeed to speak but with little reverence of
   great cities and empires: but we know that it rightly belongs to the
   Spirit of God, that in exercising his own jurisdiction, he should
   uncover the base deeds of the whole world, which otherwise would lie
   concealed and even under the appearance of virtues deceive the eyes and
   senses of the simple: and as men so much flatter themselves, and are
   inebriated with their own delusions, it is necessary that those who are
   too self-indulgent and delicate should be roughly handled. As then
   kings ever set up their own splendor that they may dazzle the eyes of
   the simple, and seem to have their own greatness as a beautiful
   covering, the Spirit of God divests them of these masks. This then is
   the reason why the Prophet speaks here, in no very respectful terms, of
   that great monarchy which had attracted the admiration of all nations.
   For when the Spirit of God adopts a humble and common mode of speaking,
   men, blinded by their vices, will not acknowledge their own baseness;
   nay, they will even dare to set up in opposition those things which
   cover their disgraceful deeds: but the Spirit of God breaks through all
   these things, and dissipates those delusions by which men impose on
   themselves.

   Such is the reason for this similitude; On account of the multitude, he
   says, of the whoredoms of the harlot, who excels in favor It is said by
   way of concession that Nineveh was in great favor, that is, that by her
   beauty she had allured to herself many nations, like a harlot who
   attains many lovers: and thus the Prophet allows that Nineveh was
   beautiful. But he adds that she was the mistress of sorceries ksph,
   casheph, means sorcery, and also juggling: we may then render ksphym,
   cashaphim, used here, juggleries, (praestigias -- sleights of hand.)
   But the Prophet seems to allude to filters or amatory potions, by which
   harlots dementate youths. As then harlots not only attract notice by
   their beauty and bland manners and other usual ways; but they also in a
   manner fascinate unhappy youths, and use various arts and delusions; so
   the Prophet under this word comprehends all the deceits practiced by
   harlots; as though he said, "This harlot was not only beautiful, but
   also an enchantress, who by her charms deceived unhappy nations like a
   strumpets who dementates unhappy youths, who do not take care of
   themselves."

   He afterwards adds, Who sells nations by her whoredoms, and tribes by
   her sorceries Though Nahum still carries on the same metaphor, he yet
   shows more clearly what he meant by whoredoms and sorceries, -- even
   the crafts of princes, by which they allure their neighbors, and then
   reduce them to bondage. Then all the counsels of kings (which they call
   policies) [240] are here, by the Spirit of God, called sorceries or
   juggleries, and also meretricious arts. This reproof, as I have already
   said, many deem to have been too severe; for so much majesty shone
   forth then in the Assyrians, that they ought, as they think, to have
   been more respectfully treated. But it behaved the Spirit of God to
   speak in this forcible language: for there is no one who does not
   applaud such crafty proceedings. Where any one, without mentioning
   princes, to ask, Is it right to deceive, and then by lies, deceptions,
   perjuries, cavils, and other arts, to make a cover for things? -- were
   this question asked, the prompt answer would be, that all these things
   are as remote as possible from virtue, as nothing becomes men more than
   ingenuous sincerity. But when princes appear in public, and make this
   pretense, that the world must be ruled with great prudence, that except
   secret counsels be taken, all kingdoms would immediately fall into
   ruin, -- this veil covers all their shameful transactions, so that it
   becomes lawful for them, and even praiseworthy, to deceive one party,
   to circumvent another, and a third to oppress by means of deception.
   Since then princes are praised for their craftiness, this is the reason
   why the Prophet here takes away, as it were by force, the mask, under
   which they hide their base proceedings; "They are," he says,
   "meretricious arts, and they are sorceries and juggleries."

   It is of one city, it is true, that he speaks here; but the Prophet no
   doubt describes in this striking representation how kingdoms increase
   and by what crafty means, -- first, by robberies, -- and then by artful
   dealings, such as would by no means become honest men in the middle
   class of life. But princes could never succeed, except they practiced
   such artifices. We yet see how they are described here by the Spirit of
   God, -- that they are like strumpets given to juggleries, and to other
   base and filthy arts, which he calls whoredoms. But I have said, that
   the meaning of the Prophet can be more clearly elicited from the second
   clause of the verse, when he says that the Ninevites made a merchandise
   of the nations. We see indeed even at this day that princes disturb the
   whole world at their pleasure; for they deliver up innocent people to
   one another, and shamefully sell them, while each hunts after his own
   advantage, without any shame; that he may increase his own power, he
   will deliver others into the hand of an enemy. Since then there are
   crafty proceedings of this kind carried on too much at this day, there
   is no need that I should attempt to explain at any length the meaning
   of the Prophet. I wish that examples were to be sought at a distance.
   Let us proceed --

   Nahum 3:5-6

   5. Behold, I am against thee, saith the Lord of hosts; and I will
   discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the nations thy
   nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.

   5. Ecce Ego ad te, inquit Jehova exercituum, et retegam fimbrias tuas
   super faciem tuam, et ostendam gentibus nuditatem tuam, et regnis
   foeditatem tuam:

   6. And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and
   will set thee as a gazingstock.

   6. Et projiciam super te sordes (vel, inquinamenta) et ignominia
   afficiam te, et ponam te quasi stercus (alii vertunt; alii autem, quasi
   exemplum; dicam postea de ipsa voce.)


   The Prophet confirms here what he has said of the fall of Nineveh; but,
   as it was stated yesterday, he introduces God as the speaker, that his
   address might be more powerful. God then testifies here to the
   Assyrians, that they should have no strife or contention with any
   mortal being, but with their own judgment; as though he said, "There is
   no reason for thee to compare thy forces with those of the Chaldeans;
   but think of this -- that I am the punisher of thy crimes. The
   Chaldeans indeed shall come; chariots shall make a noise and horses
   shall leap, and horsemen shall shake the earth; they shall brandish the
   flaming swords, and their spears shall be like lightning; but there is
   no reason for thee to think that the Chaldeans will, of themselves,
   break in upon thee: for I guide them by my hidden providence, as it is
   my purpose to destroy thee; and now the time is come when I shall
   execute on thee my judgment."

   I am, he says, Jehovah of hosts. The epithet tsv'vt tsabaut, must be
   referred to the circumstance of this passage; for God declares here his
   own power, that the Assyrians might not think that they could by any
   means escape. He then adds, I will disclose thy extremities on thy face
   He alludes to the similitude which we have lately observed; for harlots
   appear very fine, and affect neatness and elegance in their dress; they
   not only put on costly apparel, but also add disguises. Though then
   this fine dress conceals the baseness of strumpets, yet, were any to
   take the clothes of a harlot and throw them over her head, all her
   beauty would disappear, and all men would abhor the sight: to see her
   concealed parts disclosed would be a base and filthy spectacle. So God
   declares that he would strip Nineveh of its magnificent dress, that she
   might be a detestable sight, only exhibiting her own reproach. We now
   then apprehend the Prophet's meaning; as though he said, "Nineveh
   thinks not that she is to perish. -- How so? Because her own splendor
   blinds her: and she has willfully deceived herself, and, by her
   deceits, has dazzled the eyes of all nations. As then this splendor
   seems to be a defense to the city Nineveh, I the Lord, he says, will
   disclose her hidden parts; I will deprive the Assyrians of all this
   splendor in which they now glory, and which is in high esteem and
   admiration among other nations."

   And this passage ought to be especially noticed; for, as I have said,
   true dignity is not to be found in the highest princes. Princes ought,
   indeed, to seek respect for themselves by justice, integrity, mercy,
   and a magnanimous spirit: but they only excel in mean artifices; then
   they shamelessly deceive, lie, and swear falsely; they also flatter,
   even meanly, when circumstances require; they insinuate themselves by
   various crafty means, and by large promises decoy the simple. Since
   then their true dignity is not commonly regarded by princes, this
   passage ought to be observed, so that we may know that their elevation,
   which captivates the minds of men, is an abomination before God; for
   they do not discern things, but are blind, being dazzled by empty
   splendor.

   Disclose, then, he says, will I thy shame He says first, Disclose will
   I thy fringes on thy face; and then I will show to the nations thy
   nakedness And the nakedness of great kings is shown to the nations when
   the Lord executes his vengeance: for then even the lowest of the low
   will dare to pass judgment, -- "He deserved to perish with shame, for
   he exercised tyranny on his own subjects, and spared not his own
   neighbors; he never was a good prince; nay, he only employed deceits
   and perjuries." When, therefore princes are cast down, every one,
   however low, becomes a judge, and ascends as it were, the tribunal to
   burden and load them with reproaches. And hence the Prophet says, in
   the person of God, Disclose will I thy fringes on thy face, and will
   show to the nations thy nakedness, and to kingdoms thy filthiness.

   He afterwards adds, I will besprinkle thee with filth, or defilements.
   The Prophet still alludes to the similitude of a harlot, who is well
   and sumptuously adorned, and by her charms captivates the eyes of all:
   but when any one takes mire and filth from the middle of the road, and
   bespatters her with it, there is then no one who will not turn away his
   eyes from so filthy an object. But we have already explained the import
   of this. God is indeed said to besprinkle kingdoms with defilements,
   when he casts them down; for they all begin freely to express their
   opinion: and those who before pretended great admiration, now rise up
   and bring forth many reproachful things. Then it is, that the Lord is
   said to besprinkle great kingdoms with filth and defilements.

   He then adds, I will disgrace thee nvl, nubel, is to fall, and it is
   applied to dead bodies; but it means also to disgrace, as it is to be
   taken here. I will make thee as the dung Some think rv'y, ruai, to be
   dung, or something fetid: but as it comes from r'h, rae, to see, and is
   in many parts of Scripture taken for vision or view, they are more
   correct, in my judgment, who render it thus, I will make thee an
   example; so Jerome renders it; as though he said, "Thou shalt be a
   spectacle to all nations." [241] And Nineveh is said to be made an
   example, because its ruin was more memorable than that of any other
   which had previously happened. Thou shalt then be a spectacle; that is,
   the calamity which I now denounce shall attract the observation of all.
   It afterwards follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [241] The Septuagint favors this meaning, "eis paradeigma--for an
   example." In this sense Grotius and Piscator take the word. Henderson,
   with less propriety, renders it "gazingstock," the word of our version.
   Newcome translates it "dung," according to the Rabbins. -- Ed.

   When he says, kl-r'yk, cal-raik, whosoever sees thee,' we hence learn
   again that rv'y, ruai, at the end of the last verse, is to be taken for
   example or spectacle; for the Prophet proceeds with the same subject: I
   will make thee, he says, an example, or a spectacle. -- For what
   purpose? that whosoever sees thee may depart from thee [242] And it was
   an evidence of horror, though some think it to have been a reward for
   her cruelty, that no one came to Nineveh, but that she was forsaken by
   all friends in her desolation. And they take in the same sense what
   follows, Who will condole with her? and whence shall I seek comforters
   for thee? For they think that the Ninevites are here reproached for
   their cruelty, because they made themselves so hated by all that they
   were unworthy of sympathy; for they spared none, they allowed
   themselves full liberty in injuring others, they had gained the hatred
   of all the world. Hence some think that what is here intimated is, that
   the Ninevites were justly detested by and so that no one condoled with
   them in so great a calamity, inasmuch as they had been injurious to
   all: "It shall then happen, that whosoever sees thee shall go far away
   from thee and shall say, Wasted is Nineveh; who will condole with her?
   Whence shall I call comforters to her?"

   But I know not whether this refined meaning came into the Prophet's
   mind. We may explain the words more simply, that all would flee far
   away as a proof of their horrors and that the calamity would be such,
   that no lamentation would correspond with it. Who will be able to
   console with her? that is, were the greatness of her calamity duly
   weighed, though all were to weep and utter their meanings, it would not
   yet be sufficient: all lamentations would be far unequal to so great a
   calamity. The Prophet seems rather to mean this. Who then shall condole
   with her? and whence shall I seek comforters, as though he said, "The
   ruin of so splendid a city will not be of an ordinary kind, but what
   cannot be equaled by any lamentations." It then follows --

   Nahum 3:8-10

   8. Art thou better than populous No, that was situate among the rivers,
   that had the waters round about it, whose rampart was the sea, and her
   wall was from the sea?

   8. An melior es quam No (id est, Alexandria,) Amon (vertunt quidam,
   populosum; alii putant esse nomen Regis; an igitur melior es quam
   Alexandria populosa,) quae habitabat in fluviis? Mare in circuitu ejus,
   cujus fossa erat mare, et a mari murus ejus;

   9. Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put and
   Lubim were thy helpers.

   9. Aethiopia fortitudo ejus et Aegyptus; et nullus finis; Aphrica et
   Libyae fuerunt in auxilium ejus

   10. Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity: her young
   children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and
   they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were bound
   in chains.

   10. Etiam ipsa in transmigrationem abiit ad captivitatem; etiam parvuli
   ejus allisi sunt in capite omnium platearum; et super proceres ejus
   (vel, honorabiles, ad verbum) jecerunt sortem, et magnetes ejus vincti
   sunt compedibus.


   The Prophet, in order to gain credit to his prophecy, produces here the
   ensample of Alexandria. It is indeed certain, from many testimonies of
   Scripture, that Alexandria is called No, which was a very ancient city,
   situated on the confines of Africa, and yet in Egypt. It might, at the
   same time, be, that the Alexandrians formerly had their own government,
   at least their own kings: and this is probable; for the Prophet says
   here, that Egypt and Ethiopia, as well as Africa and the Libyan
   nations, were the confederates of this city. It may hence then be
   concluded, that Alexandria was not then a part of Egypt, but had its
   own government, and was in alliance with the Egyptians, as with the
   other nations. But as Egypt, after the death of our Prophet, was in
   part overthrown by the Assyrians, and in part by the Chaldeans, some
   interpreters think, that the Prophet speaks of a ruin which had not yet
   taken place. [243] But this would not harmonize with his design; for
   the Prophet shows here, as in a mirror, that the chief empires fall
   according to the will of God, and that cities, the richest and the best
   fortified, come to nothing, whenever it pleases God. Unless, then, the
   destruction of Alexandria was notorious and everywhere known, the
   Prophet could not have suitably adduced this example: I therefore doubt
   not but that Alexandria had been then demolished. It is no matter of
   wonder that it afterwards returned to its former state and became rich;
   for the situation of the city was most commodious, not so much on
   account of the fertility of the land, as on account of its traffic; for
   ships from the Mediterranean sailed up near to it. It had, indeed, on
   one side, the lake Marcotis, which is not very healthy; and then the
   sea fortified it; and Pharos was a neighboring island: but yet the city
   was inhabited by many, and adorned with splendid buildings; for the
   advantage of traffic drew together inhabitants from all quarters. It
   was afterwards built again by Alexander of Macedon. But it is evident
   enough that it had been already an opulent city: for Alexander did not
   build a new city but enlarged it. [244] Let us now come to the words of
   the Prophet.

   Shall it be better to thee than to Alexandria? The word 'mvn, amun,
   some render populous; and I am inclined to adopt this meaning, which
   has been received nearly by the consent of all. Others have supposed it
   to be the name of a king; but as proof fails them, I leave to
   themselves their own conjecture. Shall it then be better to thee than
   to Alexandria? For it stood, he says, between the rivers Alexandria had
   the Nile, as it were, under its own power; for it was then divided into
   many parts, so that it intersected the city in various places. So then
   he says, that Alexandria dwelt between the rivers; for it divided the
   Nile, as it suited its convenience, into several streams.

   Then he says, The sea was around her: for it was surrounded on one side
   by the sea, and protected by the island Pharos, which had a tower, not
   only for the sake of defense, but that ships coming in from the
   Mediterranean, might have a signal, by which they might direct their
   course straight to the harbor. The sea then was around her; for the sea
   encircled more than half of the city; and then the lake Mareotis was on
   the other side to the south. He afterwards adds, And its wall or moat
   was the sea The word is written with y, iod, chyl, chil; but it means a
   wall or a moat, though Latins render antemurale -- a front-work: for
   they were wont formerly to fortify their cities with a double wall, as
   old buildings still show. According to these interpreters chyl, chil,
   is the inner wall, and so they render its front-work: and there was
   also an outer wall towards the sea. But we may take chyl, chil, for a
   moat or a trench; and it is easy to find from other passages that it
   was a trench rather than a front-work. It is said that the body of
   Jezebel was torn by dogs in the trench, and the word there is chyl,
   chil. As to the object of the Prophet, he evidently intended to show,
   that Alexandria was so well fortified, that Nineveh had no reason to
   think herself to be in a safer state; for its fortress was from the
   sea, and also from Ethiopia, on account of the munitions which he has
   mentioned. Then he speaks of Africa and Egypt, and the Libyan nations,
   [245] and says in short, that there was no end of her strength; that
   is, that she could seek the help of many friends and confederates: many
   were ready to bring aid, even Africa, Ethiopia, and the Lybians.

   Yet, he says, she departed into captivity a captive; that is, the
   inhabitants of Alexandria have been banished, and the city become as it
   were captive, for its inhabitants were driven here and there. Dashed,
   he says, have been their little ones at the head of every street The
   Prophet means, that so great a power as that of Alexandria did not
   prevent the conquerors to exercise towards her the most barbarous
   cruelty; for it was a savage act to dash little children against
   stones, who ought on account of their tender age, to have been spared.
   There was indeed no reason for raging against them, for they could not
   have been deemed enemies. But yet the Prophet says that Alexandria had
   been thus treated; and he said this, that Nineveh might not trust in
   her strength, and thus perversely despise God's judgment, which he now
   denounced on it. He adds, They cast lots on her princess and bound were
   her great men with fetters In saying that lots were cast, he refers to
   an ancient custom; for when there was any dispute respecting a captive,
   the lot was cast: as for instance, when two had taken one man, to
   prevent contention, it was by lot determined who was to be his master.
   So then he says that lots were cast on their princes. This usually
   happened to the common people and to the lowest slaves; but the Prophet
   says that the conquerors spared not even the princes. They were
   therefore treated as the lowest class; and though they were great
   princes, they were led into captivity and bound with chains, in the
   same manner with the meanest and the lowest of the people. They were
   not treated according to their rank; and there was no differences
   between the chief men and the most degraded of the humbler classes; for
   even the very princes were so brought down, that their lot differed not
   from that of the wretched; for as common people are usually treated
   with contempt, so were the chiefs of Alexandria treated by their
   enemies.

   [243] So does Newcome, but with no countenance from the passage. The
   verb in the 10^th verse which refers to the captivity of No, is in the
   past tense. Most commentators regard the event as having passed. -- Ed.

   [244] Opinions differ as to No. Bochart supposed it to be Diospolis,
   near Mendes, in Lower Egypt. Henderson says, that later commentators
   are in favor of Thebes, the ancient capital of Upper Egypt. It is of no
   consequence to the present purpose which it was. It was some celebrated
   city in Egypt, whose ruin was well known in the Prophet's time. Both
   the Rabbins and early Fathers thought that it was what was afterwards
   called Alexandria. But most probably it was a city which had lost its
   name and existence from the catastrophe that is here mentioned. -- Ed.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that since by thy awful judgments thou dost show
   thy displeasure at the pride of this world, we may be ruled by the
   spirit of meekness, and in such a manner humble ourselves willingly
   under thy hand, that we may not experience thy dreadful power in our
   destruction, but being, on the contrary, supported by thy strength, we
   may keep ourselves in our own proper station and in true simplicity,
   and, at the same time, relying on thy protection, we may never doubt,
   but thou wilt sustain us against all the assaults of our enemies,
   however violent they may be, and thus persevere in the warfare of the
   cross which thou hast appointed for us, until we be at length gathered
   into that celestial kingdom, where we shall triumph together with thy
   Son, when his glory shall shine in us, and all the wicked shall be
   destroyed. Amen.

   Nahum 3:11

   11. Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt seek
   strength because of the enemy.

   11. Etiam tu inebriaberis, tu eris abscondita; etiam tu quaeres robur
   (vel, suppetias) ab hoste (vel, propter hostem.)


   Nahum, after having adduced the example of Alexandria, now shows that
   nothing would be able to resist God, so that he should not deal with
   Nineveh in the same manner; and he declares that this would be the
   case, Thou also, he says, shalt be inebriated. Well known is this
   metaphor, which often occurs in Scripture: for the Prophets are wont
   frequently to call punishment a cup, which God administers. But when
   God executes a heavy punishment, he is said to inebriate the wicked
   with his cup. The Prophet says now, that the chastisement of Nineveh
   would make her like a drunken man, who, being overcome with wine, lies
   down, as it were, stupefied. Hence by this metaphor he intended to set
   forth a most severe punishment: Thou then shalt be also inebriated The
   particle gm, gam, is here emphatical; it was introduced, that the
   Ninevites might know, that they could not possibly escape the
   punishment which they deserved; for God continues ever like himself.
   Thou then shalt be also inebriated This would not be consistent, were
   not God the judge of the world to the end. There is then a common
   reason for this proceeding; hence it necessarily follows, -- since God
   punished the Alexandrians, the Assyrians cannot escape his hand, and be
   exempt from punishment.

   He adds, Thou shalt be hidden Some refer this to shame, as though the
   Prophet had said, -- "Thou indeed showest thyself now to be very proud,
   but calamity will force thee to seek hiding-places, in which to conceal
   thyself." But I am more inclined to this meaning, -- that Nineveh would
   vanish away, as though it never had been; for to be hidden is often
   taken in Hebrew in the sense of being reduced to nothing.

   He afterwards says, Thou shalt also seek strength, or supplies, from
   the enemy. The words mvz m'vyv, meouz meavib, may admit of two
   meanings, -- either that she will humbly solicit her enemies, -- or
   that on account of her enemies she will flee to some foreign aid; for
   the preposition m, mem, may be taken in both senses. If we adopt the
   first meaning, then I think that the Prophet speaks not of the
   Babylonians, but of the other nations who had been before harassed by
   the Assyrians. Thou shalt now then humbly pray for the aid of those who
   have been hitherto thine enemies, -- not because they had provoked
   thee, but because thou hast as an enemy treated them. Now it is an
   extreme misery, when we are constrained to seek the help of those by
   whom we are hated, and hated, because we have by wrongs provoked them.
   But the other sense is more approved, for it is less strained: Thou
   shalt also seek aids on account of the enemy; that is, as strength to
   resist will fail thee, thou wilt seek assistance from thy neighbors.
   [246] It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [246] Thou shalt seek a refuge from the enemy. -- Newcome. But mvz is
   rather a defense, aid, assistance, that which affords strength. -- Ed.

   Nahum 3:12

   12. All thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with the firstripe
   figs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into the mouth of the
   eater.

   12. Omnes munitiones tuae ficus cum maturis (fructibus;) si moveantur,
   cadunt super os comedentis.


   The Prophet here declares that the strongholds of the Assyrians would
   avail them nothing; whether they trusted in the number of their men, or
   in their walls, or in other defenses, they would be disappointed; for
   all things, he says, will of themselves fall, even without being much
   assailed. And he employs a very apposite similitude, "Thy
   fortifications," he says, "which thou thinkest to be very strong, shall
   be like figs; for when the fruit is ripe, and any comes to the tree, as
   soon as he touches it or any of the branches, the figs will fall off
   themselves." We indeed know that there is not much firmness in that
   fruit; when it is ripe, it immediately falls to the ground, or if it
   hangs on the branches, a very little shaking will bring it down. We now
   see the design of the Prophet.

   And hence an useful doctrine may be deduced: whatever strength men may
   seek for themselves from different quarters, it will wholly vanish
   away; for neither forts, nor towers, nor ramparts, nor troops of men,
   nor any kind of contrivances, will avail any thing; and were there no
   one to rise against them, they would yet fall of themselves. It
   afterwards follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Nahum 3:13

   13. Behold, thy people in the midst of thee are women: the gates of thy
   land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire shall devour
   thy bars.

   13. Ecce populus tuus mulieres in medio tui; inimicis tuis aperiendo
   aperientur portae terrae tuae; vorabit ignis vectes tuos.


   The Prophet declares here, that the hearts of them all would become
   soft and effeminate when God would proceed to destroy Nineveh. We have
   said before that the hearts of men are so in the hand of God, that he
   melts whatever courage there may be in them, whenever he pleases: and
   God prepares men for ruin, when he debilitates their hearts, that they
   cannot bear the sight of their enemies. God indeed can leave in men
   their perverseness, so that they may ever run furiously into ruin, and
   not be able, with a courageous heart, to repel the attacks of their
   enemies; but he often softens their hearts and deprives them of power,
   that he may make more evident his judgment: God does not, however,
   always work in the same way; for variety in his judgments is calculated
   to do us good, for thereby our minds are more powerfully awakened. Were
   his proceedings uniformly the same, we could not so well distinguish
   the hand of God, as when he acts now in this way, and then in another.
   But, as I have already said, it is what is well known, that God
   enervates men and strips them of all courage, when he gives them over
   to destruction.

   So now the Prophet speaks of the Ninevites, Behold, he says, thy people
   are women [247] The demonstrative particle, Behold, is here emphatical:
   for the Assyrians, no doubt, ridiculed, as a fable, the prediction of
   the Prophet; and it was what the Israelites found it difficult to
   believe. This is the reason why the Prophet pointed out, as by the
   finger, what surpassed the comprehensions of men. By saying, in the
   midst of thee, he intimates, that though they should be separated from
   their enemies and dwell in a fortified city, they should yet be filled
   with trembling. This amplification deserves to be noticed: for it is
   nothing wonderful, when an onset frightens us, when enemies join battle
   with us, and when many things present themselves before our eyes, which
   are calculated to deprive us of courage; but when we are frightened by
   report only concerning our enemies, and we become fainthearted, though
   walls be between us, it then appears evident, that we are smitten by
   the hand of God; for when we see walls of stone, and yet our hearts
   become brittle like glass, is it not evident, that we are inwardly
   terrified by the Lord, as it were, through some hidden influence,
   rather than through intervening and natural causes? We now then
   perceive the Prophet's meaning, when he says, that the people would
   become women, or effeminate, in the midst of the city, in its very
   bowels; as though he had said, that they would not cease to tremble,
   even while they were dwelling in a safe place.

   By opening, opened shall be thy gates, he says, to thy enemies. He
   shows again, that though the Assyrians were fortified, every access
   would be made open to their enemies, as though there was no fortress.
   By saying, the gates of thy land, it is probable that he speaks not
   only of the city, but of all their strongholds. The Assyrians, no
   doubt, fortified many cities, in order to keep afar off the enemy, and
   to preserve the chief seat of the empire free from danger and fear. I
   therefore understand the Prophet as referring here to many cities, when
   he says, By opening, opened shall be the gates of thy land to thine
   enemies and fire shall consume thy bars He means, that though they had
   before carefully fortified the whole land around, so that they thought
   themselves secure from all hostile invasion, yet all this would be
   useless; for the fire would consume all their bars. By fire, the
   Prophet understands metaphorically the judgment of God. For as we see
   that so great is the vehemence of fire, that it melts iron and brass,
   so the Prophet means, that there would be no strength which could
   defend Nineveh and its empire against the hand of God. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [247] Both Homer and Virgil have this comparison. "Achaides ouk et

   Nahum 3:14-15

   14. Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go into
   clay, and tread the morter, make strong the brickkiln.

   14. Aquas obsidionis hauri tibi, robora munitiones tuas, ingredere in
   lutum, calca caementum, fortifica fornacem (vel, laterem; alii vertunt,
   tene, vel, apprehende.)

   15. There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it
   shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the
   cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts.

   15. Illic vorabit te ignis, exterminabit te gladius, comedet te quasi
   bruchus (alii vertunt, quasi bruchum;) multiplicari (ad verbum, vel,
   multiplicando; est kyrq quasi bruchus,) multiplicare quasi locusta.


   The Prophet goes on with the same subject, -- that the Ninevites would
   labor in vain, while striving anxiously and with every effort to defend
   themselves against their enemies. The meaning then is, "That though
   thou remittest no diligence, yet thou shalt lose all thy labor; for
   thou wilt not be able to resist the vengeance of God; and thou deceives
   thyself if thou thinkest that by the usual means thou canst aid
   thyself; for it is God who attacks thee by the Babylonians. How much
   soever then thou mayest accumulate of those things which are usually
   employed to fortify cities, all this will be useless." Draw for
   thyself, he says, waters for the siege; that is, lay up provisions for
   thyself, as it is usually done, and have water laid up in cisterns;
   strengthen thy fortresses, that is, renew them; enter into the clay for
   the sake of treading the mortar: fortify, or cement, or join together;
   the brick-kiln (for what some think that chzq, chezek, means, here is
   to hold, or to lay hold, is wholly foreign to the Prophet's meaning:)
   to fortify then the brick- kiln, that is, the bricks which come forth
   from the kiln, nothing else than to construct and join them together,
   that there might be a solid building: for we know that buildings often
   fall, or are overturned, because they are not well joined together: and
   he refers to the mode of building which historians say was in use among
   the Assyrians. For as that country had no abundance of stones, they
   supplied the defect by bricks. We now then understand the intention of
   the Prophet.

   But he adds, There shall the fire consume thee There is much importance
   in the adverb of place, there, which he uses: there also, he says,
   shall the fire eat thee up: for he expresses more than before, when he
   said, that the Assyrians would weary themselves in vain in fortifying
   their city and their empire; for he says now, that the Lord would turn
   to their destruction those things in which they trusted as their
   defenses; There then shall the fire consume thee We now then see what
   the Prophet means.

   We must at the same time observe, that he mentions water; as though he
   said, However sparingly and frugally thy soldiers may live, being
   content with water as their drink, (for it is necessary, when we would
   firmly resist enemies, to undergo all indulgences, and if needs be to
   endure want, at least the want of delicate meat and drink,) -- though
   thy soldiers be content with water, and seek not water fresh from the
   spring or the river, but drink it from cisterns, and though thy
   fortresses be repaired, and thy walls carefully joined together in a
   solid structure, by bricks well fitted and fastened, yet there shall
   the fire consume thee; that is, thy frugality, exertion, and care, not
   only will avail thee nothing, but will also turn out to thy ruin; for
   the Lord pronounces accursed the arrogance of men, when they trust in
   their own resources.

   He afterwards adds, Exterminate thee shall the sword; that is, the Lord
   will find out various means by which he will consume thee. By the fire,
   then, and by the sword, will he waste and destroy thee. He then says,
   He will consume thee as the chafer we may read the last word in the
   nominative as well as in the objective case -- He as a chafer will
   consume thee. If we approve of this rendering, then the meaning would
   be, -- "As chafers in a short time devour a meadow or standing corn, so
   thy enemies shall soon devour thee as with one mouthful." We indeed
   know, that these little animals are so hurtful, that they will very
   soon eat up and consume all the fruit; and there is in these insects an
   astonishing voracity. But as the Prophet afterwards compares the
   Assyrians to chafers and locusts, another sense would be more suitable,
   and that is, -- that God's judgment would consume the Assyrians, as
   when rain, or a storm, or a change of season, consumes the chafers; for
   as these insects are very hurtful, so the Lord also exterminates them
   whenever he pleases. [248] He afterwards adds, to be multiplied; which
   is, as I have said, a verb in the infinitive mood. But the sentence of
   the Prophet is this, by multiplying as the chafer, to multiply as the
   locusts: but why he speaks thus, may be better understood from the
   context; the two following verses must be therefore added --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [248] Grotius agrees in this view, though Newcome takes the former,
   explaining, "as the locust," that is, in a manner equally unsparing. --
   Ed.

   Nahum 3:16-17

   16. Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the
   cankerworm spoileth, and flieth away.

   16. Multiplicasti negotiatores tuos quasi stellas coelorum; bruchus
   praedatus est et avolat.

   17. Thy crowned are as the locusts, and thy captains as the great
   grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, but when the
   sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they are

   17. Principes tui (vel, coronati; deducitur enim a rzk quod significat
   coronam; sed malo vertere, egregios, vel, praestantissimos quosque;
   principes ergo tui, vel, eximii tui) quasi locusta, et duces tui quasi
   locusta locustarum (est quidem aliud nomen, sed non possumus certo
   distinguere inter illas species, quemadmodum dictum est Jaelis 1
   capite,) quae castramentantur (id est, considunt) in maceriis (id est,
   clausuris) in die frigoris: sol exortus est, et migrarunt; et non
   cognoscitur locus earum ubi.


   From these words we may learn what the Prophet before meant, when he
   said that the Assyrians were like locusts or chafers; as though he
   said, -- "I know that you trust in your great number; for ye are like a
   swarm of chafers or locusts; ye excel greatly in number; inasmuch as
   you have assembled your merchants and traders as the stars of heaven."
   Here he shows how numerous they were. But when he says, The chafer has
   spoiled, and flies away, he points out another reason for the
   comparison; for it is not enough to lay hold on one clause of the
   verse, but the two clauses must be connected; and they mean this, --
   that the Assyrians, while they were almost innumerable, gloried in
   their great number, -- and also, that this vast multitude would vanish
   away. He then makes an admission here and says, by multiplying thy
   merchants, thou hast multiplied them; but when he says, as chafers and
   as locusts, he shows that this multitude would not continue, for the
   Lord would scatter them here and there. As then the scattering was
   nigh, the Prophet says that they were chafers and locusts.

   We now understand the design of the Prophet: He first ridicules the
   foolish confidence with which the Assyrians were inflated. They
   thought, that as they ruled over many nations, they could raise great
   armies, and set them in any quarter to oppose any one who might attack
   them: the Prophet concedes this to them, that is, that they were very
   numerous, by multiplying thou hast multiplied; but what will this avail
   them? They shall be locusts, they shall be chafers. -- How so? A fuller
   explanation follows, Thou hast multiplied thy merchants as the stars of
   heaven: but this shall be temporary; for thou shalt see them vanishing
   away very soon; they shall be like the chafers, who, being in a moment
   scattered here and there, quit the naked field or the meadow. But by
   merchants or traders some understand confederates; and this comparison
   also, as we have before seen, frequently occurs in the Prophets: and
   princes at this day differ nothing from traders, for they outbid one
   another, and excel in similar artifices, as we have elsewhere seen, by
   which they carry on a system of mutual deception. This comparison then
   may be suitable, Thou hast multiplied thy traders, -- tes practiciens.
   But the meaning of the Prophet may be viewed as still wider; we may
   apply this to the citizens of Nineveh; for the principal men no doubt
   were merchants: as the Venetian of the present day are all merchants,
   so were the Syrians, and the Ninevites, and also the Babylonians. It is
   then nothing strange, that the Prophet, by taking a part for the whole
   should include under this term all the rich, Thou hast then multiplied
   thy merchants [249]

   He has hitherto allowed them to be very numerous; but he now adds, The
   chafer has spoiled, and flies away The verb means sometimes to spoil,
   and it means also to devour: The chafer then has devoured, and flies
   away; that is, "Thy princes, (as he afterwards calls them,) or thy
   principal men, have indeed devoured; they have wasted many regions by
   their plunders, and consumed all things on every side, like the
   chafers, who destroy the standing corn and all fruits: thou hast then
   been as a swarm of chafers." For as chafers in great numbers attack a
   field, so Nineveh was wont to send everywhere her merchants to spoil
   and to denude the whole land. "Well," he says "the chafer has devoured,
   but he flies away, he is scattered; so it shall happen," says the
   Prophet, "to the citizens of Nineveh." And hence he afterwards adds,

   And thy princes are as locusts: this refers to the wicked doings, by
   which they laid waste almost the whole earth. As then the locusts and
   chafers, wherever they come, consume every kind of food, devour all the
   fields, leave nothing, and the whole land becomes a waste; so also have
   been thy princes; they have been as locusts and thy leaders as the
   locusts of locusts, that is, as very great locusts; for this form, we
   know, expresses the superlative degree in Hebrew. Their leaders were
   then like the most voracious locusts for the whole land was made barren
   by them, as nothing was capable of satisfying their avarice and
   voracity.

   The Prophet then adds, They are locusts, who dwell in the mounds during
   the time of cold; but when the sun rises, not known any more is their
   place He now shows, that it would not be perpetual, that the Ninevites
   would thus devour the whole earth, and that all countries would be
   exposed to their voracity; for as the locusts, he says, hide themselves
   in caverns, and afterwards fly away, so it shall happen to thy princes.
   But this passage may be taken to mean, -- that the Ninevites concealed
   themselves in their hiding-places during the winter, and that when the
   suitable time for plundering came, they retook themselves in different
   directions, and took possession of various regions, and brought home
   plunder from the remotest parts. This meaning may be elicited from the
   words of the Prophet; and the different clauses would thus fitly
   coalesce together, that when the Ninevites left their nests, they
   dispersed and migrated in all directions. I do not at the same time
   disapprove of the former meaning: they are then like locusts, who lodge
   in mounds during the time of cold; but when the sun rises, -- that is,
   when the season invites them, (for he speaks not of the winter sun,)
   but when the heat of the sun prevails and temperate the air, -- then,
   he says, the locusts go forth and fly away, and known no more is their
   place He means, in short, that the Ninevites plundered, and that they
   did so after the manner of locusts; and that a similar end also was
   nigh them; for the Lord would destroy them, yea, suddenly consume them,
   so that no trace of them could be found. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [249] The latter clause of the last verse and this verse and the
   following are evidently connected. The first, htkvd, hath y added to it
   in ten or more copies, and may be deemed an imperative as well as the
   other, and in the feminine gender; Calvin takes it an infinitive. This
   would be literal rendering -- Increase thyself as the chafer,
   Increase thyself as the locust, 16. Multiply thy merchants more than
   the stars of heaven:
   The chafer spoils, and flies away: 17. Thy crowned ones shall be as the
   locusts,
   And thy rulers as the gibbous caterpillar;
   Which lodge in the fences in the cold day;
   The sun rises and they flit away,
   And not known is the place where they are. -- Ed.

   Nahum 3:18

   18. Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall dwell in
   the dust: thy people is scattered upon the mountains, and no man
   gathereth them

   18. Dormitaverunt pastores tui, rex Assur; jacuerunt fortes tui;
   dispersus est populus tuus super montes, et nemo congregans.


   He confirms the preceding verse, and says that there would be no
   counsel nor wisdom in the leading men: for the shepherds of the king of
   Assyria were his counselors, in whose wisdom he trusted, as we know
   that kings usually depend on their counselors: for they think that
   there is in them prudence enough, and therefore they commit to them the
   care of the whole people. But the Prophet ridicules the confidence of
   the king of Assyria, because the shepherds would not have so much
   vigilance as to take care of themselves, and of the people, and of the
   whole kingdom. He speaks in the past tense, either to show the
   certainty of the prediction, or because the change of tenses is common
   in Hebrew. Lie still, he says, shall thy mighty men; [250] that is,
   they shall remain idle; they shall not be able to sally out against
   their enemies, to stop their progress. They shall then lie still: and
   then he says, Scattered are thy people phvs, push, is not to scatter;
   hence I doubt not, but that there is a change of letter, that s, schin,
   is put for ts, tzaddi; and I am surprised that some derive the verb
   from phvs, push, when, on the contrary, it is from phvph, puts, and the
   change of these two letters is common in Hebrew. Thy people then are
   dispersed on the mountains and there is no one to assemble them

   By these words the Prophet means, that such would be the scattering of
   the whole kingdom, that there would be no hope of restoration; There
   will then be none to assemble them He had said before that the chiefs
   or mighty men would be still. Though it would be needful to go forth to
   check the progress of their enemies; yet he says, They shall idly lie
   down: He refers here to their sloth. But the people who ought to be
   quiet at home, as being weak and feeble, shall be dispersed on the
   mountains, and no one will be there to gather them It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [250] Fortes tui, 'dyryk, thy eminents, thy nobles. "The shepherds,"
   the governers of the people, nmv, slumber; and the nobles, the princes,
   ysknv, rest, sit still, without making any effort: then it follows, --
   Dispersed are thy people on the mountains,
   And there is no gatherer. Calvin is mistaken as to the meaning of the
   verb phvs: it means more properly, than the other, a dispersed state.
   It is applied in Leviticus 13:5, and in other places, to the spreading
   of leprosy. When so used, it is in Kal. It is here, and here only, in
   Niphal. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Nahum 3:19

   19. There is no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all that
   hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee: for upon whom
   hath not thy wickedness passed continually?

   19. Non est contractio (vel, cicatrix) fracturae tuae; dolore est plena
   plaga tua; omnes qui audierint famam tuam (id est, de te) percutient
   manum super te; quia super quem non transiit malitia tua jugiter?


   The Prophet shows here more clearly, that when the empire of Nineveh
   should be scattered, it would be an incurable evil, that every hope of
   a remedy would be taken away. Though the wicked cannot escape calamity,
   yet they harbor false expectations, and think that they can in a short
   time gather new strength. Hence, in order to take from them this hope,
   the Prophet says, that there would be no contraction of the fracture
   [251] And this is a striking similitude; for he compares the ruin of
   Nineveh to a wound which cannot be seamed and healed. There is then no
   contraction; some render it, a wrinkle, but improperly. There is then
   no contraction: and he adds, Thy stroke is full of pain; [252] that is,
   the pain of thy stroke cannot be allayed. This is one thing, -- that
   the ruin of Nineveh would be irreparable.

   Then he says, Whosoever shall hear the report, shall strike the hand on
   thy account Many give this rendering, They shall clap the hand over
   thee, or with the hands; and they think that the singular is put for
   the plural number. But as in Hebrew to strike the hand is a token of
   consent, it would not be unsuitable to say, that the Prophet means,
   that wherever the report of this calamity would be heard, all would
   express their approbation, "See, God has at length proved himself to be
   the just avenger of so much wickedness." To strike the hand is said to
   be done by those who make an agreements or when any one pledges himself
   for another. [253] As then in giving pledges, and in other compacts,
   men are said to strike the hand; so also all shall thus give their
   assent to God's judgment in this case, "O how rightly is this done! O
   how justly has God punished these tyrants, these plunderers." They will
   then strike the hand on thy account; that is, "This thy ruin will be
   approved;" as though he said, "Not only before God art thou, Nineveh,
   accursed, but also according to the consent of all nations." And thus
   he intimates, that Nineveh would perish in the greatest dishonor and
   disgrace. It sometimes happens that an empire falls, and all bewail the
   event: but God here declares, that he would not be satisfied with the
   simple destruction of the city Nineveh without adding to it a public
   infamy, so that all might acknowledge that it happened through his
   righteous judgment.

   He afterwards adds, For upon whom has not thy wickedness passed
   continually? This is a confirmation of the last clause; and this reason
   will suit both the views which have been given. If we take the striking
   of the hand for approbation, this reason will be suitable. -- How? For
   all nations will rejoice at thy destruction, because there is no nation
   which thou hast not in many ways injured. So also, in token of their
   joy, all will congratulate themselves, as though they were made free;
   or they will clap their hands, that is, acknowledge that thou hast been
   destroyed by the judgment of God, because all had experienced how
   unjustly and tyrannically thou hast ruled. As then thy wickedness has
   been like a deluge, and hast nearly consumed all the earth, all will
   clap or shake their hands at thy ruin.

   And he says, continually, to show that God's forbearance had been long
   exercised. Hence, also, it appears, that the Assyrians were
   inexcusable, because, when God indulgently spared them, they did not
   repent, but pursued their wicked ways for a long course of time. As
   then to their sinful licentiousness they added perverseness, every
   excuse was removed. But the Prophet does, at the same time, remind the
   Israelites, that there was no reason for them to be cast down in their
   minds, because God did not immediately execute punishment; for by the
   word tmyd, tamid, he insinuates, that God would so suspend for a time
   his judgment as to Nineveh, that his forbearance and delay might be an
   evidence of his goodness and mercy. We hence see that the Prophet here
   opposes the ardor of men, for they immediately grow angry or complain
   when God delays to execute vengeance on their enemies.

   He shows that God has a just reason for not visiting the wicked with
   immediate punishment; but yet the time will come when it shall appear
   that they are altogether past recovery, -- the time, I say, will come,
   when the Lord shall at length put forth his hand and execute his
   judgment.

   [251] 'yn-khh lsvrk -- No stopping or restraining to thy breach. The
   word is applied to the restraint put on men's wickedness, 1 Samuel
   3:13, and to the checking and restraining of the spread of leprosy,
   Leviticus 6:28. The breach or breaking was such that there was no
   stopping of it from becoming entire and complete. The Septuagint gives
   the meaning--"ouk estin easis te suntribe sou -- there is no healing to
   thy breach." -- Ed.

   [252] Rather, "grievous is thy stroke." The verb is nchlh, from chlh,
   to be languid, and sometimes, to make languid, grievous or afflictive,
   and then in Niphal, as here, to be grievous. See the same clause in
   Jeremiah 10:19. As a noun it is rendered "grief" in Isaiah 17:11. --
   Ed.

   [253] The phrase here used, tq kph, is found in three other places,

   and in the two other places, in the sense here mentioned. -- Ed.

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as we are not able to keep a firm footing in
   the way of justice and uprightness, -- O grant, that, being governed by
   thy Spirit, we may restrain ourselves from doing any harm, and thus
   abstain from all evil deeds, and that we may labor to do good to all,
   so that we may, by experience, find that all are protected by thee, who
   so conform themselves to the rule of thy Law, that they take no
   advantage of the simple, either for the purpose of ruining or of
   injuring them, but who, being content with their own small portion,
   know that there is nothing better than to be wholly subject to thee,
   and to thy guidance: and may we thus live in forbearance and justice
   towards our neighbors, that we may, at the same time, rely on thy
   mercy, by which alone we can be defended, and made safe against so many
   assaults of Satan and of the wicked, until, having at length completed
   the course of our warfare, we shall come into that blessed rest which
   has been prepared for us in heaven by Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen.

   A Translation of Calvin's Version of

   The Book of Jonah.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter 1

   1 And the word of Jehovah came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,

   2 "Arise, go to Nineveh, to that great city, and cry against it; for
   their wickedness has ascended before my face."

   3 But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah,
   and went down to Joppa, and found a ship, which was going to Tarshish;
   and he paid the fare, and went down into it,, that he might go with
   them to Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah.

   4 And Jehovah sent a strong wind on the sea, and a great tempset arose
   in the sea, and the ship was thought to be breaking:

   5 And the mariners feared, and cried every one to his god, and cast out
   the wares, which were in the ship, into the sea, that it might be
   lightened of them; but Jonah had gone down to the sides of the ship;
   and he lay down and slept.

   6 And the pilot came to him, and he said to him, -- "What meanest thou,
   O sleeper? Arise, call on thy God, if so be that God will show himself
   propitious to us, that we may not perish."

   7 And they said each to his friend, -- "Come and let us cast lots, that
   we may know for what cause is this evil come upon us." And they cast
   lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.

   8 And they said to him, -- "Tell us now why has this evil happened to
   us, what is thy work, and whence comest thou, what is thy country, and
   from what people art thou?"

   9 And he said to them, -- "I am an Hebrew, and I fear Jehovah, the God
   of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land."

   10 And the men feared with great fear, and said to him, -- "Why hast
   thou done this?" (52) For the men knew that he was fleeing from the
   presence of Jehovah, because he had told them.

   11 And they said to him, "What shall we do to thee, that the sea may be
   still to us?" for the sea was going and was tempestuous.

   12 And he said to them, -- "Take me and cast me into the sea, and the
   sea will be still to you; for I know that on my account is this great
   tempest come upon you."

   13 But the men toiled to bring back the ship, (59) and they could not;
   for the sea was going and was tempestuous against them.

   14 And they cried to Jehovah, and said, -- "We beseech, Jehovah, we
   pray, that we perish not for the life of this man, and lay not on us
   innocent blood; for thou, Jehovah, hast done as it has seemed good to
   thee." (62)

   15 Then they took Jonah, and cast him into the sea; and the sea stopped
   from its raging.

   16 And with great fear, the men feared Jehovah, and sacrificed a
   sacrifice to Jehovah, and vowed vows.

   17 And Jehovah provided a great fish to swallow up Jonah; and Jonah was
   in the bowels of the fish three days and three nights.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 2

   1 And Jonah prayed to Jehovah his God from the belly of the fish,

   2 And said, -- I cried in my distress to Jehovah, and he heard me; (75)
   From the belly of the grave I cried, thou didst hear my voice.

   3 But cast me hadst thou into the deep, Into the midst of the seas, and
   the flood surrounded me; All thy billows and waves over me passed:

   4 Then I said, -- "I am driven from the sight of thine eyes; But I
   would again see the temple of thy holiness."

   5 Beset me did the waters even to the soul, The deep on every side
   surrounded me, The sedge was wrapped around my head:

   6 To the roots of the mountains I descended, The earth with its bars
   was around me forever: But to ascend hast thou made my life from the
   grave, O Jehovah my God.

   7 When fail did my soul within me, Jehovah did I remember, And enter
   did my prayer into the temple of thy holiness.

   8 They who observe lying vanities, Their own mercy forsake: (87)

   9 But I, with the voice of praise, will sacrifice to thee; What I have
   vowed will I pay: To Jehovah belongs salvation.

   10 And Jehovah commanded the fish, and it cast forth Jonah on the dry
   land.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 3

   1 And the word of Jehovah came to Jonah the second time, saying, --

   2 "Arise, go to Nineveh, to that great city, and proclaim to it the
   proclamation which I command thee." (92)

   3 And Jonah arose, and went to Nineveh, according to the command of
   Jehovah.

   4 Now Nineveh was a very great city, a journey of three days. And Jonah
   began to enter a journey of one day, and cried and said, "Yet forty
   days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown."

   5 And the men of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put
   on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them:

   6 For word had come to the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his
   throne, and cast aside his splendid robe from him, and put on sackcloth
   and sat on ashes;

   7 And it was proclaimed and published through Nineveh, by the counsel
   of the king and his nobles, saying, -- "Man and beast! Ox and sheep!
   Let them taste nothing, let them not be fed, and let them not drink
   water;

   8 And let man and beast put on sackcloth, and cry to God mightily;
   (107) and return let every one from his evil way, and from the plunder
   that is in their hands.

   9 Who knows, whether God will change and repent, and turn away from the
   fury of his wrath, that we perish not?"

   10 And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and
   God repented of the evil which he had declared that he would do to
   them, and did it not.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 4

   1 And Jonah was grievously displeased, and he was very angry; (116) and
   he prayed to Jehovah, and said, --

   2 "I pray thee, Jehovah, was not this my word, when I was yet in my own
   land? I therefore hastened to flee to Tarshish; for I knew that thou
   are a God full of grace, and merciful, slow to wrath, great in
   kindness, and who repentest of evil.

   3 And thou, Jehovah, take, I pray, my life from me; for better it is
   for me to die than to live."

   4 And Jehovah said to him, -- "Doest thou well in being angry?" (129)

   5 And Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east over against the
   city, and made there for himself a tent, and sat under it in the shade,
   until he saw what might be in the city.

   6 And Jehovah God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up for Jonah,
   that it might be a shade over his head, and free him from his distress;
   and Jonah rejoiced for the gourd with great joy.

   7 God also prepared a worm, when the morning rose the next day, which
   smote the gourd, and it withered:

   8 And it was, when the sun arose, that God prepared an impetuous wind,
   and the sun smote the head of Jonah, and he fainted, and wished for
   himself that he might die, and said, "Better is my death than my life."

   9 And God said to Jonah, -- "Doest thou well in being angry for the
   gourd?" and he said, -- "I do well in being angry even unto death."

   10 And Jehovah said, -- "Thou wouldest have spared the gourd, for which
   thou hast not labored, and which thou has not raised up; the daughter
   of a night it was, [254] and as the daughter of a night it has passed
   away;

   11 And should I not spare Nineveh, this great city, in which there are
   twelve times ten thousand men, every one of whom knows not his right
   hand from his left, and also many animals?"

   a translation of

   Calvin's Version of

   The Prophecies of Micah.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 1

   1 The word of Jehovah, which came to Micah, the Morasthite, in the days
   of Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning
   Samaria and Jerusalem:

   2 Hear, all ye people, Give ear, O earth, and its fullness; (155) And
   the Lord Jehovah shall be against you a witness, Even the Lord from the
   temple of his holiness:

   3 For, behold, Jehovah goeth forth from his place, And will descend and
   tread on the heights of the earth;

   4 And melt shall the mountains under him, And rent shall be the
   valleys; As wax before the fire, As waters rolling into a lower place.
   (160)

   5 For the wickedness of Jacob is all this, And for the transgressions
   of the house of Israel: What is the wickedness of Jacob? Is it not
   Samaria? And what are the high places of Judah? Are they not those of
   Jerusalem? (162)

   6 I will therefore make Samaria A heap of the field, a plantation for
   vineyards; And I will roll into the valley its stones, And its
   foundations will I discover;

   7 And all her graven images shall be broken down, And all her rewards
   shall be burnt in the fire, And all her idols will I lay desolate; For
   from the reward of a harlot hath she gathered, And to the reward of a
   harlot shall they return.

   8 For this will I wail and howl, I will go spoiled and naked; I will
   make wailing as the dragons, And mourning as the daughters of the
   ostrich: (170)

   9 For grievous is her stroke, For it has come to Judah, It has reached
   the gate of my people--even Jerusalem.

   10 In Gath tell ye it not; weeping, weep not; In the house of Ophrah,
   roll thyself in the dust.

   11 Pass over also, thou inhabitant of Saphir, Naked and in shame; Go
   forth shall not the inhabitant of Zaanan, In the mourning of Beth-ezel;
   She will take from you her station. (176)

   12 Verily, grieved for good has the inhabitant of Maroth; For come down
   has evil from Jehovah To the gate of Jerusalem.

   13 Tie the chariot to the dromedary, Thou inhabitant of Lachish; The
   beginning of sin has she been to the daughter of Zion; For in thee have
   been found the transgressions of Israel.

   14 Thou shalt therefore send presents, For Moresheth-gath, to the sons
   of Achzib, (180) Who have been a deception to the kings of Israel.

   15 Yet a possessor will I send to thee, inhabitant of Mareshah; Even to
   Adullam, the glory of Israel, shall he come.

   16 Make bald, and poll thyself, For the children of thy delicacies;
   Enlarge thy baldness as the eagle, Inasmuch as they have migrated from
   thee.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 2

   1 Woe to those who devise iniquity, And contrive wickedness on their
   beds! When the morning shines, they execute it; For to do it their hand
   is ready.

   2 And they covet fields, and forcibly take them; And houses, and they
   take them away; And they oppress a man and his house, A man and his
   heritage. (187)

   3 Therefore, thus saith Jehovah, -- Behold, I am devising against this
   family an evil, From which ye shall not remove your necks; And ye shall
   not walk in your height, For an evil time will it be.

   4 In that day shall they take up against thee a proverb, And bewail
   with a lamentable lament, And say, "Wasted, we are laid waste; The
   portion of my people has he changed; How he takes away from me instead
   of restoring! Our fields he divides." (191)

   5 There shall not therefore be for thee One to cast a line for lot in
   the assembly of Jehovah.

   6 "Prophecy not, ye who prophesy;" -- They shall not prophesy for them;
   -- He will not take reproaches. (195)

   7 O thou who art called the house of Jacob! Is the Spirit of Jehovah
   straightened? Are these his works? Are not my words good to him Who
   walks uprightly? (201)

   8 And they who were heretofore my people, Have risen up as an enemy
   against me; The robe of beauty they plunder From those who pass by
   securely, As those who return from war. (203)

   9 The women of my people have ye expelled From the house of their
   delights; From their children have ye taken away My ornament forever.
   (204)

   10 Arise, depart, for this is not your rest; Because it has been
   polluted: (206) He will scatter you with a violent scattering.

   11 If a man, walking in the spirit, and lying deceitfully, says, "I
   will prophesy to thee of wine and of strong drink," He shall be the
   prophet of this people. (208)

   12 Gathering, I will gather the whole of thee Jacob, Assembling, I will
   assemble the residue of Israel; I will set them together as the sheep
   of Bozrah, As a flock in the midst of its fold; They shall make a noise
   on account of the number of men.

   13 Ascend shall a breaker before them, They shall break through and
   pass the gate; Yea, they shall go out through it; And pass shall their
   king before them, And Jehovah at their head. (215)

   CHAPTER 3

   1 And I said, "Hear, I pray, ye princes of Jacob; And ye rulers of the
   house of Israel: Is it not for you to know judgment?"

   2 But they hate good and love evil; They pull off the skin from them,
   And the flesh from their bones:

   3 Yea, they devour the flesh of my people, And their skin they strip
   from them, And their bones they break, And make them small as for the
   pot, And their flesh for the cauldron.

   4 They shall then cry to Jehovah, And he will not answer them, But he
   will hide his face from them at that time, As they have acted
   perversely in their doings.

   5 Thus saith Jehovah to the Prophets, Who deceive my people, And bite
   with their teeth, and cry, "Peace;" And when any one putteth not in
   their mouth, Against him they declare war;

   6 Night shall therefore be to you instead of a vision, And darkness
   shall be to you instead of divination;' And set shall the sun on the
   Prophets, And darkened over them shall be the day: (227)

   7 And ashamed shall be the seers, And confounded shall be the diviners;
   And they shall all cover their lips, For there will be no answer from
   God.

   8 But I indeed am filled with power, By the Spirit of Jehovah, yea,
   with judgment and courage, To declare to Jacob his wickedness, And to
   Israel his sin.

   9 Hear this, I pray, ye princes of the house of Jacob, And ye rulers of
   the house of Israel, Who abominate judgment, And all rectitude pervert;
   (237)

   10 Who build Zion by blood, And Jerusalem by iniquity.

   11 Its princes judge for reward, And its priests for wages teach, And
   its prophets for money divine; And on Jehovah they lean, saying, "Is
   not Jehovah in the midst of us? Come upon us shall no evil."

   12 Therefore for you Zion as a field shall be plowed, And Jerusalem
   shall be a heap, And the mount of the house as the heights of a forest.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 4

   1 But it shall be in the last days, That the mount of the house of
   Jehovah Shall be set in order on the top of the mountains, And elevated
   shall it be above the hills; And assemble there shall nations; (252)

   2 And go shall many nations and say, -- "Come and let us ascend to the
   mount of Jehovah, And to the house of the God of Jacob; And he will
   teach us of his ways, And we will walk in his paths:" For from Zion
   shall go forth a law, And the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem;

   3 And he will rule among many people, And convince strong nations afar
   off; (260) And beat their swords shall they into plowshares, And their
   spears into pruninghooks; And lift up shall not a nation against a
   nation a sword, And they shall learn war no more;

   4 And they shall sit everyone under his own vine, And under his own
   fig-tree; And none will there be to terrify them; For thus hath the
   mouth of Jehovah of hosts spoken.

   5 For all people shall walk, Every one in the name of his god; (271)
   But we will walk In the name of Jehovah our God forever.

   6 In that day, saith Jehovah, I will assemble the lame, And the driven
   out will I gather, And her whom I have afflicted:

   7 And I will make the lame a remnant, And the driven out a strong
   nation; Reign over them shall Jehovah on mount Zion, From henceforth,
   even forever.

   8 And thou tower of the flock, The fortress of the daughter of Zion, To
   thee it shall come; Yea, come shall the former dominion; The kingdom,
   to the daughter of Jerusalem.

   9 Why dost thou now cry with a loud crying? Is there no king in thee?
   Has thy counselor perished? For seized thee has pain as one in travail.

   10 Be in pain, and groan, O daughter of Zion, As a woman in travail;
   For go forth shalt thou from the city, And thou shalt dwell in the
   field, Yea, thou shalt go as far as Babylon; There shalt thou be
   delivered, There shall Jehovah redeem thee From the hand of thy
   enemies.

   11 And now gathered against thee are many nations, Who say, "Let her be
   condemned, And look shall our eye on Zion." (284)

   12 But they know not the thoughts of Jehovah, And understand not his
   counsel; For he shall gather them as a handful to the floor.

   13 Arise, and thrash, thou daughter of Zion; For thy horn will I make
   iron, And thy hoofs will I make brass; And thou shalt tear in pieces
   strong nations; And consecrate to Jehovah their wealth, And their
   substance to the Lord of the whole earth.

   CHAPTER 5

   1 Assemble now thyself, thou daughter of a troop; A siege has he set
   against us: (294) With a rod shall they smite on the cheek the judge of
   Israel.

   2 And thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, Art small to be among the thousands of
   Judah! From thee shall to me come forth One to be a ruler in Israel;
   And his goings forth are from the beginning, From the days of ages.

   3 He will therefore give them up till the time, When she who travails
   shall bring forth, And return to the children of Israel Shall the
   residue of his brethren:

   4 And he shall stand and feed in the power of Jehovah, In the majesty
   of the name of Jehovah his God; And they shall quietly dwell, For he
   shall now be magnified to the ends of the earth.

   5 And he shall be our peace; When the Assyrian shall come into our
   land, And when he shall tread in our palaces, Then we shall set up
   against him seven shepherds, And eight princes of men;

   6 And they shall lay waste The land of the Assyrian by the sword, And
   the land of Nimrod by their swords; (311) And he will deliver us from
   the Assyrian, When he shall come into our land, And when he shall tread
   in our borders.

   7 And the residue of Jacob shall be, Among the nations, in the midst of
   many people, As a dew from Jehovah, as drops of rain on the grass;
   Which tarries not for man, nor waits for the sons of men.

   8 The residue of Jacob shall also be, Among the nations, in the midst
   of many people, As a lion among the beasts of the forest, As a young
   lion among a flock of sheep, Who, when he passes through, tears and
   carries away, And no one can deliver.

   9 Exalted shall be thy hand above thine enemies, And all thine
   adversaries shall be cut off.

   10 And it shall be in that day, saith Jehovah, That I will cut off thy
   horses from the midst of thee, And I will destroy thy chariots;

   11 And cut off will I the cities of thy land, And will overthrow all
   thy fortresses;

   12 And I will cut off diviners from thine hand, And soothsayers shall
   not be to thee;

   13 And cut off will I thy graven images, And thy stature from the midst
   of thee, And thou shalt no more bow down Before the work of thy hands;

   14 And I will demolish thy groves from the midst of thee, That I man
   destroy thine enemies;

   15 And in anger and fury will I execute on the nations A vengeance,
   which they have not heard.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 6

   1 Hear ye now what Jehovah saith, -- "Arise, contend before the
   mountains, And let the hills hear thy voice."

   2 Hear, ye mountains, the controversy of Jehovah, And ye strong
   foundations of the earth; For Jehovah has a controversy with his
   people, And with Israel he will contend: --

   3 "My people! What have I done to thee? And in what have I molested
   thee? Testify against me.

   4 I have indeed made thee to ascend from Egypt, And from the house of
   servants I redeemed thee; I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.

   5 My people! Remember now What Balak, the king of Moab, consulted, And
   what Balaam, the son of Bosor, answered him, And what happened from
   Shittim even to Gilgal, That thou mayest know the righteousness of
   Jehovah." (336)

   6 "Wherewith shall I approach Jehovah? And bow down myself before the
   high God? Shall I approach him with burnt-sacrifices? With calves a
   year old?

   7 Will Jehovah be pleased with thousands of rams? With ten thousands of
   rivers of oil? Shall I give my first-born as my sin-offering? The fruit
   of my loins as an expiation For the wickedness of my soul?" --

   8 He hath declared to thee, O man, what is good: And what does Jehovah
   require from thee, But to do justice, and to love mercy, And to humble
   thyself to walk with thy God?

   9 The voice of Jehovah crieth to arouse; And the man of understanding
   will see his name: Hear ye the rod, and who testifies of it.

   10 Are there still in the house of the wicked The treasures of
   iniquity, And the scanty detestable measure?

   11 Shall I justify balances of wickedness, And the bag of deceitful
   weights?

   12 For her rich men have filled themselves by violence, And her
   inhabitants have spoken falsehood, And their tongue is deceitful in
   their mouth.

   13 And I also by smiting will afflict thee, And thee will I destroy for
   thy sins: (352)

   14 Thou shalt eat and not be satisfied, And thy casting down shall be
   in the midst of thee; And thou shalt lay hold, and not deliver, And
   what thou deliverest will I give up to the sword:

   15 Thou shalt sow and not reap, Thou shalt press the oil, and not
   anoint thyself with oil, And the new wine, and not drink wine.

   16 For observed are the statues of Omri, And every work of the house of
   Ahab; And ye walk in their counsels, That I should make thee a
   desolation, And her inhabitants an hissing; And the reproach of my
   people ye shall bear.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 7

   1 Woe is me! For I am as the ingatherings of summer, And as the bunches
   of the vintage: There is no cluster to eat; The ripe fruits my soul
   hath desired. (360)

   2 Perished has the meek from the land, And upright among men there is
   none; For all lie in wait for blood, Every one hunts his brother with a
   net.

   3 To effect the wickedness of their hands, The prince asketh, and the
   judge also, for reward. And the great man speaks himself Of the
   mischief of his soul; and they wrap it up. (365)

   4 The good among them is like a brier, The upright is worse than a
   thorn-hedge: The day of thy watchmen, thy visitation, is coming; They
   shall be their confusion.

   5 Trust not a friend, put no faith in a counselor; From her who
   sleepeth in thy bosom, Guard the openings of thy mouth:

   6 For the son dishonors his father, The daughter rises up against her
   mother, The daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; Enemies to man
   are his own domestics.

   7 But I to Jehovah will look, I will wait for the God of my salvation;
   Hear me will my God.

   8 Rejoice not thou over me, my enemy; (374) Though I have fallen, I
   shall rise again; When I sit in darkness, Jehovah will be my light.

   9 The wrath of Jehovah will I bear, (For I have sinned against him,)
   Until he plead my cause, And execute judgment for me; He will bring me
   to light, I shall see his righteousness:

   10 And see shall my enemy, And cover her shall shame, who said to me,
   -- "Where is Jehovah thy God?" Mine eyes shall see her; And now trodden
   shall she be as the mire of the street.

   11 The day to build thy walls! That day shall remove far the decree:

   12 And in that day to thee shall they come From Assyria and the cities
   of the fortress, From the fortress also to the river, (386) And from
   sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain, --

   13 But the land shall become a desolation, On account of its
   inhabitants, For the fruit of their works.

   14 Feed thy people by thy crook, Thy flock of thy heritage, Who dwell
   in solitude, in the wood, As in the midst of Carmel; They shall be fed
   in Bashan and Gilead, As in the days of old. (392)

   15 As in the days of thy going forth from the land of Egypt, I will
   show to him wonderful things.

   16 Shall see the nations, And be ashamed of all their might; They shall
   lay their hand on their mouth, Their ears shall become deaf;

   17 They shall lick the dust as a serpent, As reptiles of the earth
   shall they move from their holes; Jehovah our God shall they dread, And
   they shall be afraid of thee.

   18 What God is like thee, Taking away iniquity, And passing over
   transgression, As to the remnant of his heritage? He will not retain
   forever his anger, For he loveth mercy:

   19 He will return, he will have mercy on us; He will tread down our
   iniquities, And cast into the depths of the sea all their sins:

   20 Thou wilt grant truth to Jacob, Mercy to Abraham; Which thou hast
   sworn to our fathers In the days of old.

   The Prophecies of Nahum.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 1

   1 The burden of Nineveh, -- the book of the vision of Nahum the
   Elkoshite:

   2 A God jealous, and an avenger is Jehovah; Avenger is Jehovah, and a
   retainer of wrath; Take vengeance does Jehovah on his enemies, And keep
   it for his adversaries: (421)

   3 Jehovah is slow to wrath, and great in power, And by clearing he will
   not clear: Jehovah! In the whirlwind and tempest is his way, And the
   cloud is the dust of his feet: (424)

   4 He chides the sea, and it becomes dry; And all the rivers he dried
   up; Languish do Bashan and Carmel, And the flower of Lebanon
   languishes:

   5 Mountains tremble at him, and hills melt; And burn does the earth
   before his face, Yea, the world, and all who dwell in it. (427)

   6 Before his indignation who can stand? And who can bear the fierceness
   of his wrath? (429) His fury is poured out like fire, And rocks
   dissolve before him.

   7 Good is Jehovah for strength in the day of distress; And he knoweth
   them who hope in him.

   8 But with an inundation, he, passing through, Will make a consummation
   in her place; (433) And pursue shall darkness his enemies.

   9 What do ye imagine against Jehovah? A consummation he makes! Not rise
   again shall affliction.

   10 They who are like entangled thorns, And drunken as with their own
   drinking -- Devoured shall they be as stubble fully dry. (437)

   11 From thee has gone forth a contriver of evil Against Jehovah, a
   wicked counselor.

   12 Thus saith Jehovah, -- Though they are secure, and though they are
   many, They shall yet be cut off, and he shall pass through: (443) And
   through I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more;

   13 For now will I break off from thee his yoke, And his bonds will I
   burst asunder.

   14 And a command respecting thee hath Jehovah given, -- "Let none be
   sown hereafter of thy name;" From the house of thy gods will I cut off
   The graven and the molten image; I will make thy grave, for thou art
   execrable.

   15 Behold on the mountains the feet of him Who announceth, who
   publisheth peace! Celebrate thou, Judah, thy solemnities, Perform thy
   vows; for pass through thee Shall the wicked one no more, -- he is
   wholly cut off.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 2

   1 Come up is the destroyer before thy face; Watch the fortress, guard
   the way, (455) Make strong the loins, fortify mightily thy strength:

   2 (For taken away hath Jehovah the pride of Jacob, As he had done as to
   the pride of Israel; As he had done as to the pride of Israel; For
   emptied them the emptiers, And their branches have they cut down:)

   3 The shield of his mighty ones are made red, The men of his strength
   are clad in scarlet; With the fire of torches is the chariot, In the
   day of his expedition; And the fir-trees tremulously shake:

   4 In the wide places they madden with their chariots, The hurry away
   through the streets, The appearance of them is that of lamps, As
   lightnings they run here and there.

   5 He will remember his valiant men, They shall stumble in their march,
   They shall hasten to her wall, And prepared will be the defense.

   6 The gates of the rivers are opened, And the palace is dissolved;

   7 And she which stood firm is cast into exile, And her maids lead her
   as with the voice of doves, Beating on their breasts. (463)

   8 And yet Nineveh had been As a pool of waters from ancient days; But
   now they flee -- "Stand ye, stand;" And no one regards.

   9 Take ye away the silver, take away the gold; For there is no end of
   her preparations; Her glory is from every desirable vessel. (468)

   10 Emptied and emptied is she, and denuded; And the heart is melted;
   And there is a knocking of the knees, And trembling in all loins, And
   the faces of all withdraw their brightness. (472)

   11 Where is the abode of lions? Where came the lion, the lioness, the
   cub of the lion; And none terrified them. (474)

   12 The lion tare what sufficed his whelps, And strangled for his
   lionesses, And filled with raving his caves, And his dens with prey.

   13 Behold, I am against thee, saith Jehovah of hosts, And I will burn
   with smoke her chariot, And thy young lions shall the sword devour, And
   I will cut off from the land thy prey, And the sound of thy teeth shall
   no more be heard.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 3

   1 Oh blood city! The whole is full of deceit, and of ravin; From it the
   prey departs not.

   2 The sound of the whip! The sound of the rattling of the wheel! And
   the horse prancing, and the chariot bounding!

   3 The horseman urging onward! And the flame of the sword, and the
   lightning of the spear! And the number of the slain, and the mass of
   carcasses! And there is no end to her dead bodies, They stumble on
   their carcasses!

   4 This is for the multitude of the fornications Of the harlot who
   excels in beauty, The mistress of sorceries, Who sells nations by her
   fornications, And tribes by her sorceries. (481)

   5 Behold, I am against thee, saith Jehovah of hosts: And I will throw
   thy skirts over thy face, And show to the nations thy nakedness, And to
   kingdoms thy filthiness;

   6 And I will cast on thee filth, and disgrace thee, And I will make
   thee an example:

   7 And it shall be, that whosoever seeth thee Shall flee away from thee,
   and say, -- "Wasted is Nineveh! Who will condole with her? Whence shall
   I seek comforters for thee?

   8 Are thou better than populous No, Which dwelt among the rivers? The
   sea was around her; Whose mound was the sea, and the sea was her wall;

   9 From Ethiopia was her strength, and from Egypt, And there was no end
   to it; Africa and Lybia were her auxiliaries:

   10 Even she migrated, she went into captivity; And her infants were
   bound in chains.

   11 Thou also shalt be inebriated, thou shalt be hid; And thou shat seek
   strength from the enemy.

   12 All thy fortresses shall be like fig-trees with ripe fruit; If they
   be shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater.

   13 Behold, thy people shall be women in the midst of thee; To thine
   enemies shall be opened in the gates of thy land, Devour shall the fire
   thy bars.

   14 Waters for the siege draw for thyself, Strengthen thy fortresses,
   Enter into the clay, tread the mortar, Make strong the brick-kiln:

   15 There shall the fire devour you, Exterminate thee shall the sword,
   It shall devour thee as the chafer. Increase as the chafer, increase as
   the locust;

   16 Thou hast multiplied thy merchants More than the stars of heaven; --
   The chafer has spoiled, and flies away.

   17 Thy princes are as locusts, And thy captains are as the largest
   locusts; Which encamp in the fences in the cold day; The sun rises, and
   they fly away, And not known is the place where they are. (502)

   18 Slept have thy shepherds, king of Assyria; Lie down did thy mighty
   men: Dispersed is thy people on the mountains, And no one gathers them.

   19 There is no binding for thy fracture, Altogether grievous is thy
   wound; All who shall hear a report of thee, Shall, on thy account,
   strike the hand; For upon whom hath not passed Thy wickedness
   continually?
