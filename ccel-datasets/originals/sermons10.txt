                       Suffering And Reigning With Jesus

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING JANUARY 3, 1864,

   BY THE REV. C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "If we suffer, we shall also reign with Him: if we deny Him, He also
   will deny us." 2 Timothy 2:12.

   MY venerable friend who has up to now sent me a text for the New Year,
   still ministers to his parish the Word of Life and has not forgotten to
   furnish the passage for our meditation today. Having preached from one
   of a very similar character a short time ago, I have felt somewhat
   embarrassed in preparation. But I will take courage and say with the
   Apostle, "To write the same things to you, to me, indeed, is not
   grievous, but for you it is safe." If I should bring forth old things
   on this occasion, be you not unmindful that even the wise householder
   does this at times. For oft-recurring sickness the same wine may be
   prescribed by the most skillful physician without blame. No one scolds
   the contractor for mending rough roads again and again with stones from
   the same quarry. The wind which has borne us once into the haven is not
   despised for blowing often from the same quarter, for it may do us good
   service yet again. And therefore I am assured that you will endure my
   repetitions of the same Truths of God, since they may assist you to
   suffer with patience the same trials.

   You will observe that our text is a part of one of Paul's faithful
   sayings. If I remember rightly, Paul has four of these. The first
   occurs in 1 Timothy 1:15, that famous, that chief of all faithful
   sayings, "This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation, that
   Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.
   "A golden saying, whose value Paul himself had most marvelously proved.
   What shall I say of this verse, but the same--the lamp of a lighthouse,
   it has darted its ray of comfort through leagues of darkness and guided
   millions of tempest-tossed spirits to the port of Peace.

   The next faithful saying is in the same Epistle, at the fourth chapter
   and the ninth verse. "Godliness is profitable unto all things, having
   the promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come. This
   is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation." This, too, the
   Apostle knew to be true, since he had learned in whatsoever state he
   was in to be content. Our text is a portion of the third faithful
   saying. And the last of the four you will find in Titus 3:8, "This is a
   faithful saying and these things I will that you affirm constantly,
   that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good
   works. These things are good and profitable unto men." We may trace a
   connection between these faithful sayings.

   The first one, which speaks of Jesus Christ coming into the world to
   save sinners, lays the foundation of our eternal salvation in the Free
   Grace of God, as shown to us in the mission of the great Redeemer. The
   next affirms the double blessedness which we obtain through this
   salvation--the blessings of the upper and nether springs--of time and
   of eternity. The third faithful saying shows one of the duties to which
   the chosen people are called. We are ordained to suffer for Christ with
   the promise that "if we suffer, we shall also reign with Him." The last
   faithful saying sets forth the active form of Christian service,
   bidding us diligently to maintain good works.

   Thus you have the root of salvation in Free Grace. You have next the
   privileges of that salvation in the life which now is and in that which
   is to come. And you have also the two great branches of suffering with
   Christ and service of Christ loaded with the fruits of the Spirit of
   all Divine Grace. Treasure up, dear Friends, those faithful sayings,
   "Lay up these words in your heart; bind them for a sign upon your hand
   that they may be as frontlets between your eyes." Let these choice
   sayings be printed in letters of gold and set up as tablets upon the
   doorposts of our house and upon our gates. Let them be the guides of
   our life, our comfort and our instruction. The Apostle of the Gentiles
   proved them to be faithful. They are faithful still, not one word shall
   fall to the ground. They are worthy of all acceptation--let us accept
   them now and prove their faithfulness--each man for himself.

   This morning's meditation is to be derived from a part of that faithful
   saying which deals with suffering. We will read the verse preceding our
   text. "It is a faithful saying: For if we are dead with Him, we shall
   also live with Him." All the elect were virtually dead with Christ when
   He died upon the tree--they were on the Cross--crucified with Him. In
   Him, as their representative, they rose from the tomb and live in
   newness of life. Because He lives, they shall live also. In due time
   the chosen are slain by the Spirit of God and so made dead with Christ
   to sin, to self-righteousness, to the world, the flesh and the powers
   of darkness.

   Then it is that they live with Jesus! His life becomes their life and
   as He was, so are they also in this world. The Spirit of God breathes
   the quickening Grace into those who were once dead in sin and thus they
   live in union with Christ Jesus. When Believers die, though they may be
   sawn in sunder, or burnt at the stake, yet, since they sleep in Jesus,
   they are preserved from the destruction of death by Him and are made
   partakers of His immortality. May the Lord make us rooted and grounded
   in the mysterious but most consolatory doctrine of union with Christ
   Jesus.

   We must at once advance to our text--"If we suffer, we shall also reign
   with Him: if we deny Him, He also will deny us." The words naturally
   divide themselves into two parts--suffering with Jesus and its
   reward--denying Jesus and its penalty.

   I. SUFFERING WITH JESUS AND ITS REWARD. To suffer is the common lot of
   all men. It is not possible for us to escape from it. We come into this
   world through the gate of suffering and over death's door hangs the
   same escutcheon. We must suffer if we live, no matter in what style we
   spend our existence. The wicked man may cast off all respect for virtue
   and riot in excess of vice to the utmost degree, yet, let him not
   expect to avoid the well-directed shafts of sorrow. No, rather let him
   look for a tenfold share of pain of body and remorse of soul. "Many
   sorrows shall be to the wicked."

   Even if a man could so completely degrade himself as to lose his
   intellectual powers and become a brute, yet even then he could not
   escape from suffering. For we know that the brute creation is the
   victim of pain as much as more lordly man. Only, as Dr. Chalmers well
   remarks, the brutes have the additional misery that they have no mind
   endowed with reason and cheered by hope to fortify them under their
   bodily affliction.

   Understand, O Man, that however you may degrade yourself, you are still
   under the yoke of suffering--the loftiest bow beneath it nor the
   meanest can avoid it. Every acre of humanity must be furrowed with this
   plow. There may be a sea without a wave but never a man without sorrow.
   He who was God as well as Man had His full measure pressed down and
   running over! Let us be assured that if the Sinless One was not spared
   the rod, the sinful will not go free. "Man that is born of woman is of
   few days and full of trouble." "Man is born unto trouble as the sparks
   fly upward."

   If then, a man has sorrow, it does not necessarily follow that he shall
   be rewarded for it since it is the common lot brought upon all by sin.
   You may smart under the lashes of sorrow in this life but this shall
   not deliver you from the wrath to come. Remember, you may live in
   poverty and drag along a wearisome existence of ill-requited toil. You
   may be stretched upon a bed of sickness and be made to experience an
   agony in every single member of your body. And your mind, too, may be
   depressed with fears, or plunged in the depths of despair. And yet, by
   all this you may gain nothing of any value to your immortal spirit,
   for, "Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."

   And no amount of affliction upon earth can alter that unchanging rule
   so as to admit an unregenerate man into Heaven. To suffer is not
   peculiar to the Christian--neither does suffering necessarily bring
   with it any recompense of reward. The text implies most clearly that we
   must suffer with Christ in order to reign with Him. The structure of
   the preceding verse plainly requires such a reading. The words, "with
   Him," may be as accurately supplied at the close of the one clause as
   the other. The suffering which brings the reigning with Jesus must be a
   suffering with Jesus.

   There is a very current error among those poor people who are ignorant
   of true religion that all poor and afflicted people will be rewarded
   for it in the next state. I have heard working men refer to the parable
   of the rich man and Lazarus with a cruel sort of satisfaction at the
   pains of Dives because they have imagined that, in the same manner, all
   rich people would be cast into the flames of Hell without a drop of
   water to cool their tongue--while all poor persons like Lazarus would
   be triumphantly carried into Abraham's bosom.

   A more fearful mistake could not be made! It was not the suffering of
   Lazarus which entitled him to a place in Abraham's bosom. He might have
   been licked by all the dogs on earth and then have been dragged off by
   the dogs of Hell! Many a man goes to Hell from a dunghill. A drunkard's
   hovel is very wretched--is he to be rewarded for bringing himself to
   rags? Very much of the beggary we see abroad is the result of vice,
   extravagance, or folly--are these things so meritorious as to be
   passports to Heaven?

   Let no man deceive himself so grossly! On the other hand the rich man
   was not cast into Hell because he was rich and fared sumptuously. Had
   he been rich in faith, holy in life and renewed in heart, his purple
   and fine linen would have done him no hurt. Lazarus was carried above
   by the angels because his heart was in Heaven--and the rich man lifted
   up his eyes in Hell, because he had never lifted them up towards God
   and heavenly things. It is a work of Free Grace in the heart and
   character which shall decide the future--not poverty or wealth. Let
   intelligent persons combat this notion whenever they meet with it.

   Suffering here does not imply happiness hereafter. It is only a certain
   order of suffering to which a reward is promised--the suffering which
   comes to us from fellowship with the Lord Jesus and conformity to His
   image. A few words here, by way of aiding you in making the
   distinction. We must not imagine that we are suffering for Christ and
   with Christ if we are not in Christ. If a man is not a branch of the
   Living Vine, you may prune and cut until the sap flows and the branch
   bleeds but he will never bring forth heavenly fruit. Prune the bramble
   as long as ever you like. Use the knife until the edge is worn
   away--the brier will be as sharp and fruitless as ever!

   You cannot by any process of pruning translate it into one of the vines
   of Eshcol. If a man remains in a state of nature, he is a member of the
   earthly Adam--he will not, therefore, escape suffering--but ensure it.
   He must not, however, dream that because he suffers he is suffering
   with Christ! He is plagued with the old Adam. He is receiving with all
   the other heirs of wrath the sure heritage of sin. Let him consider
   these sufferings of his to be only the first drops of the awful shower
   which will fall upon him forever--the first tingling cuts of that
   terrible whip which will lacerate his soul forever.

   If a man is in Christ, he may then claim fellowship with the second
   Man, who is the Lord from Heaven and he may expect to bear the image of
   the heavenly in the Glory to be revealed. O my Hearers, are you in
   Christ by a living faith? Are you trusting in Jesus only? If not,
   whatever you may have to mourn over on earth, you have no hope of
   reigning with Jesus in Heaven. Supposing a man to be in Christ--it does
   not even follow, then, that all his sufferings are sufferings with
   Christ. If a good man were, out of mistaken views of mortification and
   self-denial, to mutilate his body, or to flog his flesh as many a
   sincere enthusiast has done, I might admire the man's fortitude, but I
   should not allow for an instant that he was suffering with Christ!

   Who called men to such austerities? Certainly not the God of Love! If,
   therefore, they torture themselves at the command of their own fancies,
   fancy must reward them, for God will not. If I am rash and imprudent
   and run into positions for which neither Providence nor Grace has
   fitted me, I ought to question whether I am not rather sinning than
   communing with Christ. Peter drew his sword and cut off the ear of
   Malchus. If somebody had cut his ear off, what would you say? He took
   the sword and he feels the sword! He was never commanded to cut off the
   ear of Malchus and it was his Master's gentleness which saved him from
   the soldiers' rage.

   If we let passion take the place of judgment, and let self-will reign
   instead of Scriptural authority, we shall fight the Lord's battles with
   the devil's weapons! And if we cut our own fingers we must not be
   surprised. On several occasions, excited Protestants have rushed into
   Romish cathedrals, have knocked down the priest and dashed the wafer
   upon the ground, trod upon it and in other ways exhibited their hatred
   of idolatry. Now when the Law has interposed to punish such outrages,
   the offenders are hardly to be considered as suffering with Christ!
   This I give as one instance of a class of actions to which overheated
   brains sometimes lead men under the supposition that they will join the
   noble army of martyrs.

   The martyrs were all chosen to their honorable estate. And I may say of
   martyrdom as of priesthood, "No man takes that honor upon himself but
   he that is called thereunto as was Aaron." Let us mind we all make a
   distinction between things which differ and do not pull a house down on
   our heads and then pray the Lord to console us under the trying
   Providence.

   Again, in troubles which come upon us as the result of sin, we must not
   think we are suffering with Christ. When Miriam spoke evil of Moses and
   the leprosy polluted her, she was not suffering for God. When Uzziah
   thrust himself into the temple and became a leper all his days, he
   could not say that he was afflicted for righteousness' sake. If you
   speculate and lose your property, do not say that you are losing all
   for Christ's sake! When you unite with bubble companies and are duped,
   do not whine about suffering for Christ--call it the fruit of your own
   folly. If you will put your hand into the fire and it gets burned, why,
   it is the nature of fire to burn you or anybody else! Be not so silly
   as to boast as though you were a martyr.

   If you do wrong and suffer for it, what thanks have you? Go behind the
   door and weep for your sin, but come not forth in public to claim a
   reward. Many a hypocrite, when he has had his deserts and has been
   called by his proper name, has cried out, "Ah, I am persecuted!" It is
   not an infallible sign of excellence to be in bad repute among men. Who
   feels any esteem for a cold-blooded murderer? Does not every man
   reprobate the offender? Is he, therefore, a Christian because he is
   spoken against and his name cast out as evil? Assuredly not! He is a
   heartless villain and nothing more. Brethren, truthfulness and honesty
   should stop us from using expressions which involve a false claim. We
   must not talk as if we suffered nobly for Jesus when we are only
   troubled as the result of sin. O, to be kept from transgression! Then
   it matters not how rough the road of obedience may be--our journey
   shall be pleasant because Jesus walks with us.

   Be it observed, moreover, that suffering such as God accepts and
   rewards for Christ's sake must have God's Glory as its end. If I suffer
   that, I may earn a name, or win applause among men. If I venture into
   trial merely that I may be respected for it, I shall get my reward--but
   it will be the reward of the Pharisee and not the crown of the sincere
   servant of the Lord Jesus. I must mind, too, that love to Christ and
   love to His elect is ever the mainspring of all my patience,
   remembering the Apostle's words, "Though I give my body to be burned
   and have not charity, it profits me nothing."

   If I suffer in bravado, filled with proud defiance of my fellow men. If
   I love the dignity of singularity and out of dogged obstinacy hold to
   an opinion, not because it is right--but because I choose to think as I
   like, then I suffer not with Jesus. If there is no love to God in my
   soul. If I do not endure all things for the elect's sake, I may bear
   many a cuff and buffeting, but I miss the fellowship of the Spirit and
   have no recompense.

   I must not forget, also, that I must manifest the Spirit of Christ or I
   do not suffer with Him. I have heard of a certain minister, who, having
   had a great disagreement with many members in his Church, preached from
   this text, "And Aaron held his peace." The sermon was intended to
   portray himself as an astonishing instance of meekness. But as his
   previous words and actions had been quite sufficiently violent, a witty
   hearer observed that the only likeness he could see between Aaron and
   the preacher, was this, "Aaron held his peace and the preacher did
   not."

   It is easy enough to discover some parallel between our cases and those
   of departed saints, but not so easy to establish the parallel by holy
   patience and Christ-like forgiveness. If I have, in the way of virtue,
   brought down upon myself shame and rebuke. If I am hot to defend myself
   and punish the slanderer. If I am irritated, unforgiving and proud--I
   have lost a noble opportunity of fellowship with Jesus. I must have
   Christ's Spirit in me, or I do not suffer acceptably. If like a sheep
   before her shearers, I can be dumb. If I can bear insult and love the
   man who inflicts it. If I can pray with Christ, "Father, forgive them,
   for they know not what they do." If I submit all my case to Him who
   judges righteously and count it even my joy to suffer reproach for the
   cause of Christ--then and only then, have I truly suffered with Christ.

   These remarks may seem very cutting and may take away much false but
   highly-prized comfort from some of you. It is not my intention to take
   away any true comfort from the most humble Believer who really suffers
   with my Lord. But God grant we may have honesty enough not to pluck
   flowers out of other men's gardens, or wear other men's honors. Truth
   will only be desired by true men.

   I shall now very briefly show what are the forms of real suffering for
   Jesus in these days. We have not now to rot in prisons, to wander about
   in sheepskins and goatskins, to be stoned, or to be sawn in
   sunder--though we ought to be ready to bear all this if God wills it.
   The days of Nebuchadnezzar's furnace are past, but the fire is still
   upon earth. Some suffer in their estates. I believe that to many
   Christians it is rather a gain than a loss, so far as pecuniary matters
   go, to be Believers in Christ. But I meet with many cases--cases which
   I know to be genuine--where persons have had to suffer severely for
   conscience sake.

   There are those present who were once in very comfortable
   circumstances, but they lived in a neighborhood where the majority of
   the business was done on a Sunday. When Divine Grace shut up their
   shop, trade left them. And I know some of them are working very hard
   for their bread, though once they earned abundance without any great
   toil. They do it cheerfully for Christ's sake, but the struggle is a
   hard one. I know other persons who were employed as servants in
   lucrative positions involving sin, but upon their becoming Christians
   they were obliged to resign their former post and are not at the
   present moment in anything like such apparent prosperity as they were.

   I could point to several cases of persons who have really suffered to a
   very high degree in pecuniary matters for the Cross of Christ.
   Brethren, you may possess your souls in patience and expect as a reward
   of Grace that you shall reign with Jesus your Beloved! Those
   feather-bed soldiers who are broken-hearted if fools laugh at them
   should blush when they think of those who endure real hardship as good
   soldiers of Jesus Christ. Who can waste his pity over the small griefs
   of faint hearts when cold, hunger, and poverty are cheerfully endured
   by the true and brave?

   Cases of persecution are by no means rare. In many a country village
   squires and priests rule with a high hand and smite the godly villagers
   with a rod of iron. "No blankets, no coals, no almshouse for you if you
   venture into the Meeting House. You cannot live in my cottage if you
   have a Prayer Meeting in it. I will have no religious people on my
   farm." We who live in more enlightened society little know the
   terrorism exercised in some of the rural districts over poor men and
   women who endeavor conscientiously to carry out their convictions and
   walk with Christ.

   True Christians of all denominations love each other and hate
   persecution, but nominal Christians and ungodly men would make our land
   as hot as in the days of Mary if they dared. To all saints who are
   oppressed, this sweet sentence is directed--"If we suffer, we shall
   also reign with Him." More usually, however, the suffering takes the
   form of personal contempt. It is not pleasant to be pointed at in the
   streets and have opprobrious names shouted after you by vulgar tongues.
   Nor is it a small trial to be saluted in the workshop by opprobrious
   epithets, or to be looked upon as an idiot or a madman.

   And yet this is the lot of many of the people of God every day of the
   week. Many of those who are of the humbler classes have to endure
   constant and open reproach. And those who are richer have to put up
   with the cold shoulder and neglect and sneers as soon as they become
   true disciples of Jesus Christ. There is more sting in this than some
   dream. And we have known strong men who could have borne the lash
   brought down by jeers and sarcasms, even just as the wasp may more
   thoroughly irritate and vex the lion than if the noblest beast of prey
   should attack him. Believers have also to suffer slander and falsehood.
   It is not expedient for me, doubtless, to glory, but I know a man who
   scarcely ever speaks a word which is not misrepresented and hardly
   performs an action which is not misconstrued.

   The press at certain seasons, like a pack of hounds, will get upon his
   track and worry him with the most bases and undeserved abuse. Publicly
   and privately he is accustomed to be sneered at. The world whispers,
   "Ah, he pretends to be zealous for God, but he makes a fine thing of
   it!" Mark you, when the world shall learn what he does make of it,
   maybe it will have to eat its words! But I forbear such is the portion
   of every servant of God who has to bear public testimony for the Truth
   of God.

   Every motive but the right one will be imputed to him. His good will be
   evil spoken of. His zeal will be called imprudence--his courage,
   impertinence--his modesty, cowardice. It is impossible for the true
   Believer in Christ who is called to any eminent service to do anything
   right. He had better at once learn to say with Luther, "The world hates
   me and there is no love lost between us, for as much as it hates me, so
   heartily do I hate it." He meant not the men in the world, for never
   was there a more loving heart than Luther's. But he meant the fame, the
   opinion, the honor of the world he trod beneath his feet. If in your
   measure you bear undeserved rebuke for Christ's sake, comfort
   yourselves with these words, "If we suffer, we shall also reign with
   Him: if we deny Him, He also will deny us."

   Then again, if in your service for Christ you are enabled to sacrifice
   yourself--bearing upon yourself inconvenience and pain, labor and
   loss--then I think you are suffering with Christ. The Missionary who
   tempts the stormy deep--the herald of the Cross who penetrates into
   unknown regions among savage men--the tract distributor toiling up the
   mountainside--the teacher going wearily to the class--the village
   preacher walking many toilsome miles--the minister starving on a
   miserable pittance--the evangelist content to break down in health--all
   these and their like suffer with Christ.

   We are all too much occupied with taking care of ourselves. We shun the
   difficulties of excessive labor. And frequently behind the
   entrenchments of taking care of our constitution we do not half as much
   as we ought. A minister of God is bound to spurn the suggestions of
   ignoble ease--it is his calling to labor! And if he destroys his
   constitution, I for one, thank God that He permits us the high
   privilege of so making ourselves living sacrifices. If earnest
   ministers should bring themselves to the grave, not by imprudence, for
   that we would not advocate--but by honest labor, such as their ministry
   and their consciences require of them--they will be better in their
   graves than out of their graves if they come there for the cause of
   Christ. What? Are we never to suffer? Are we to be carpet-knights? Are
   God's people to be put away in padding, perfumed with lavender and
   boxed up in quiet softness? No! Not unless they would lose the reward
   of true saints!

   Let us not forget that contention with inbred lusts, denials of proud
   self, resistance of sin and agony against Satan are all forms of
   suffering with Christ. We may, in the holy war within us, earn as
   bright a crown as in the wider battlefield beyond us. O for Grace to be
   ever dressed in full armor, fighting with principalities and powers and
   spiritual wickedness of every sort! There is one more class of
   suffering which I shall mention and that is, when friends forsake, or
   become foes. Father and mother forsake sometimes. The husband
   persecutes the wife. We have known even the children turn against the
   parents. "A man's foes are they of his own household." This is one of
   the devil's best instruments for making Believers suffer. And those who
   have to drain this cup for the Lord's sake shall reign with Him.

   Brethren, if you are thus called to suffer for Christ, will you quarrel
   with me if I say, in adding all up, what a very little it is compared
   with reigning with Jesus? "For our light affliction, which is but for a
   moment, works for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory."
   When I contrast our sufferings of today with those of the reign of
   Mary, or the persecutions of the Albigenses on the mountains, or the
   sufferings of Christians in Pagan Rome--why ours are scarcely a pin's
   prick--and yet what is the reward? We shall reign with Christ!

   There is no comparison between the service and the reward. Therefore it
   is all of Grace. We do but little and suffer but little--and even that
   little, Grace gives us! And yet the Lord grants us, "A far more
   exceeding and eternal weight of Glory." We are not merely to sit with
   Christ, but we are to reign with Christ. All that the pomp imperial of
   His Kingship means. All that the treasure of His wide dominions can
   yield. All that the majesty of His everlasting power can bestow-- all
   this is to belong to you--given to you of His rich, Free Grace, as the
   sweet reward of having suffered for a little time with Him!

   Who would draw back, then? Who among you will flinch? Young man, have
   you thought of flying from the Cross? Young woman, has Satan whispered
   to you to shun the thorny pathway? Will you give up the crown? Will you
   miss the Throne? O Beloved, it is so blessed to be in the furnace with
   Christ, and such an honor to stand in the pillory with Him that if
   there were no reward, we might count ourselves happy! But when the
   reward is so rich, so super-abundant, so eternal, so infinitely more
   than we had any right to expect--will we not take up the Cross with
   songs and go on our way rejoicing in the Lord our God?

   II. DENYING CHRIST, AND ITS PENALTY. "If we deny Him, He also will deny
   us." Dreadful "if," and yet an "if which is applicable to every one of
   us. If the Apostles, when they sat at the Lord's Supper, said, "Lord,
   is it I?" surely we may say as we sit here, "Lord, shall I ever deny
   You?" You who say most loudly, "Though all men shall deny You, yet I
   will not"--you are the most likely to do it!

   In what way can we deny Christ? Some deny Him openly, as scoffers do,
   whose tongue walks through the earth and defies Heaven. Others do this
   willfully and wickedly in a doctrinal way, as the Arians and Socinians
   do who deny His deity--those who deny His Atonement, who rail against
   the inspiration of His Word--these come under the condemnation of those
   who deny Christ. There is a way of denying Christ without even speaking
   a word and this is the more common.

   In the day of blasphemy and rebuke, many hide their heads. They are in
   company where they ought to speak up for Christ. But they put their
   hands upon their mouths. They come not forward to profess their faith
   in Jesus. They have a sort of faith, but it is one which yields no
   obedience. Jesus bids each Believer to be baptized. They neglect His
   ordinance. Neglecting that, they also despise the weightier matters of
   the Law. They will go up to the House of God because it is fashionable
   to go there. But if it were a matter of persecution, they would forsake
   the assembling of themselves together.

   In the day of battle they are never on the Lord's side. If there is a
   parade, and the banners are flying and the trumpets are sounding, if
   there are decorations and medals to be given away, there they are. But
   if the shots are flying, if trenches have to be carried and forts to be
   stormed, where are they? They have gone back to their dens and there
   will they hide themselves till fair weather shall return.

   Mind, mind, mind, for I am giving a description, I am afraid, of some
   here. Mind, I say, you silent ones, lest you stand speechless at the
   bar of Judgment. Some, after having been long silent and so practically
   denying Christ, go farther and apostatize altogether from the faith
   they once had. No man who has a genuine faith in Christ will lose it,
   for the faith which God gives will live forever. Hypocrites and
   formalists have a name to live while yet they are dead--and after a
   while they return like the dog to its vomit and the sow which was
   washed to her wallowing in the mire. Certain professors do not run this
   length, yet practically deny Christ by their lives, though they make a
   profession of faith in Him.

   Are there not some here who hove been baptized and who come to the
   Lord's Table but what is their character? Follow them home. I would to
   God they never had made a profession because in their own houses they
   deny what in the House of God they have avowed. If I see a man drunk.
   If I know that a professor indulges in lasciviousness. If I know a man
   to be harsh and overbearing and tyrannical to his servants. If I know
   another who cheats in his traffic and another who adulterates his
   goods. And if I know that such men profess allegiance to Jesus--which
   am I to believe--their words or their deeds? I will believe that which
   speaks loudest! And as actions always speak louder than words, I will
   believe their actions--I believe that they are deceivers whom Jesus
   will deny at the last.

   Should we not find many present this morning belonging to one or other
   of these grades? Does not this description suit at least some of you?
   If it should do so, do not be angry with me but stand still and hear
   the Word of the Lord. Know, O Man that you will not perish even if you
   have denied Christ, if now you fly to Him for refuge. Peter denied, but
   yet Peter is in Heaven. A transient forsaking of Jesus under temptation
   will not bring on everlasting ruin, if faith shall step in and the
   Grace of God shall intervene. But persevere in it--continue still in a
   denial of the Savior and my terrible text will come upon you--"He also
   will deny you."

   In musing over the very dreadful sentence which closes my text, "He
   also will deny us," I was led to think of various ways in which Jesus
   will deny us. He does this sometimes on earth. You have read, I
   suppose, of the death of Francis Spira. If you have ever read it, you
   never can forget it to your dying day. Francis Spira knew the Truth of
   God. He was a reformer of no mean standing, but when brought to death,
   out of fear, he recanted. In a short time he fell into despair and
   suffered Hell upon earth. His shrieks and exclamations were so horrible
   that their record is almost too terrible for print. His doom was a
   warning to the age in which he lived.

   Another instance is narrated by my predecessor, Benjamin Keach, of one
   whom, during Puritanical times, was very earnest for Puritanism but
   afterwards, when times of persecution arose, forsook his profession.
   The scenes at his deathbed were thrilling amid terrible. He declared
   that though he sought God, Heaven was shut against him. Gates of brass
   seemed to be in his way. He was given up to overwhelming despair. At
   intervals he cursed. At other intervals he prayed and so perished
   without hope.

   If we deny Christ, we may be delivered to such a fate. If we have stood
   highest and foremost in God's Church and yet have not been brought to
   Christ--if we should become apostates--a high soar will bring a deep
   fall. High pretensions bring down sure destruction when they come to
   nothing. Even upon earth Christ will deny such. There are remarkable
   instances of persons who sought to save their lives and lost them. One
   Richard Denton, who had been a very zealous Lollard and was the means
   of the conversion of an eminent saint, when he came to the stake, was
   so afraid of the fire that he renounced everything he held and went
   into the Church of Rome.

   A short time after, his own house took fire, and going into it to save
   some of his money, he perished miserably, being utterly consumed by
   that fire which he had denied Christ in order to escape. If I must be
   lost, let it be any way rather than as an apostate. If there is any
   distinction among the damned, those have it who are wandering stars,
   trees plucked up by the roots, twice dead, for whom Jude tells us, is
   "reserved the blackness of darkness forever." Reserved! As if nobody
   else were qualified to occupy that place but themselves. They are to
   inhabit the darkest, hottest place because they forsook the Lord.

   Let us, my dear Friends, rather lose everything than lose Christ. Let
   us sooner suffer anything than lose our ease of conscience and our
   peace of mind. When Marcus Arethusus was commanded by Julian the
   apostate to subscribe towards the rebuilding of a heathen temple which
   his people had pulled down upon their conversion to Christianity, he
   refused to obey. And though he was an aged man, he was stripped naked
   and then pierced all over with lancets and knives. The old man still
   was firm.

   If he would give but one halfpenny towards the building of the temple,
   he could be free--if he would cast in but one grain of incense into the
   censer devoted to the false gods, he might escape. He would not
   countenance idolatry in any degree. He was smeared with honey and while
   his innumerable wounds were yet bleeding, the bees and wasps came upon
   him and stung him to death. He could die, but he could not deny his
   Lord. Arethusus entered into the joy of his Lord, for he nobly suffered
   with Him!

   In the olden time when the Gospel was preached in Persia, one
   Hamedatha, a courtier of the king, having embraced the faith, was
   stripped of all his offices, driven from the palace and compelled to
   feed camels. This he did with great content. The king, passing by one
   day, saw his former favorite at his ignoble work, cleaning out the
   camel's stables. Taking pity upon him he took him into his palace,
   clothed him with sumptuous apparel, restored him to all his former
   honors and made him sit at the royal table. In the midst of the dainty
   feast, he asked Hamedatha to renounce his faith.

   The courtier, rising from the table, took off his garments with haste,
   left all the dainties behind him, and said, "Did you think that for
   such silly things as these I would deny my Lord and Master?" And away
   he went to the stable to his ignoble work. How honorable is all this!
   How shall I denounce the meanness of the apostate--his detestable
   cowardice to forsake the bleeding Savior of Calvary to return to the
   beggarly elements of the world which he once despised and to bow his
   neck again to the yoke of bondage? Will you do this, O followers of the
   Crucified?

   You will not! You cannot! I know you cannot if the Spirit of the Lord
   dwells in you and it must dwell in you if you are the children of God.
   What must be the doom of those who deny Christ, when they reach another
   world? Perhaps they will appear with a sort of hope in their minds and
   they will come before the Judge, with, "Lord, Lord, open to us." Who
   are you? He says. "Lord, we once took the Lord's Supper--Lord, we were
   members of the Church, but there came very hard times. My mother bade
   me give up religion. Father was angry. Trade went bad. I was so mocked
   at, I could not stand it. Lord, I fell among evil acquaintances and
   they tempted me--I could not resist. I was Your servant--I did love
   You--I always had love towards You in my heart, but I could not help
   it--I denied You and went to the world again."

   What will Jesus say? I know you not! "But, Lord, I want You to be my
   Advocate." I know you not! "But, Lord, I cannot get into Heaven unless
   You should open the gate--open it for me." I do not know you! I do not
   know you! "But, Lord, my name was in the Church Book." I know you
   not--I deny you. "But will You not hear my cries?" You did not hear
   Mine--you did deny Me and I deny you. "Lord, give me the lowest place
   in Heaven, if I may but enter and escape from wrath to come." No, you
   would not brook the lowest place on earth and you shall not enjoy the
   lowest place here. You had your choice and you did choose evil. Keep to
   your choice. You were filthy, be you filthy still. You were unholy, be
   you unholy still.

   O, Sirs, if you would not see the angry face of Jesus! O, Sirs, if you
   would not behold the lightning flashing from His eyes and hear the
   thunder of His mouth in the day when He judges the fearful and the
   unbelieving and the hypocrite. If you would not have your portion in
   the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, cry this day mightily
   unto God, "Lord, hold me fast, keep me, keep me. Help me to suffer with
   You, that I may reign with You. But do not, do not let me deny You,
   lest You also should deny me."

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY EVENING, OCTOBER 18, 1863,

   BY THE REV. C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And the Lord said unto Moses, Why cry you unto Me? Speak unto the
   children of Israel, that they go forward." Exodus 14:15.

   SPIRITUAL men, in their distresses, turn at once to prayer even as the
   stag when hunted takes to flight. Prayer is a never-failing resort. It
   is sure to bring a blessing with it. Even apart from the answer of our
   supplications, the very exercise of prayer is healthy to the man
   engaged in it. Far be it from me ever to say a word in disparagement of
   the holy, happy, heavenly exercise of prayer. But, Beloved, there are
   times when prayer is not enough--when prayer itself is out of season.
   You will think that a hard saying and say, "Who can bear it?" But my
   text is to the point. Moses prayed that God would deliver His people.
   But the Lord said to him, "Why cry you unto Me?" As much as to say this
   is not the time for prayer, it is the time for action. "Speak unto the
   children of Israel, that they go forward." When we have prayed over a
   matter to a certain degree, it then becomes sinful to tarry any longer.
   Our plain duty is to carry our desires into action, and having asked
   God's guidance and having received Divine power from on high, to go at
   once to our duty without any longer deliberation or delay.

   Brethren, a vigorous faith will often shut its eyes to difficulties.
   When faith looks upon a difficulty as being exceedingly great, then she
   turns to prayer. But, on the other hand, after having sought God's help
   and having received it, she frequently laughs at the impossibility and
   cries, "It shall be done." and then, instead of betaking herself any
   longer to her knees, she boldly marches on, believing that the
   difficulty will vanish before her, that the crooked will be made
   straight and the rough places plain. We are not to be always praying
   over a difficulty. When we have fairly committed it to God, we are to
   act upon the assurance that He has heard us.

   Nor will such an action be the fruit of rashness for it is a solid and
   substantial fact that prayer does avail with God. Beloved, it strikes
   me that the advice which the Lord gave to Moses was such as He has
   given to the preacher tonight-- and that the message which Moses
   delivered to the children of Israel is a very fit one for me to deliver
   to you. Short, prompt, soldier-like, here is the whole of it--"Forward!
   Forward!" If you have been sitting down or tempted to go
   back--"Forward!" We have long been praying, let us tonight, "go
   forward." The one subject we shall take up and try to deliver to
   different classes of characters, is, "Thus says the Lord, you children
   of Israel, Forward!"

   I. First, we will contemplate THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AS A FLOCK OF
   FUGITIVES. And in this light they give encouragement to trembling
   sinners flying from the curse of the Law and from the power of their
   sins. I think I see those poor Israelites crowding together, all
   alarmed and afraid, whispering to one another some such trembling words
   as these--"I saw them. I saw my old master on horseback riding after
   me. I looked and I saw regiment upon regiment of warriors marching in
   long red lines." "I heard," says another, "the sound of their war
   music. I heard the clash of their spears. We cannot stand against them!
   We are only defenseless multitudes and they are the well-trained sons
   of Mizraim. Their swords will be drunk with our blood."

   They huddled together as a company of doves seeking to escape the hawk.
   Alas! What can they do? They are crying to God and to Moses, thinking
   of this plan and devising another. And Moses himself, in some sort of
   alarm, is crying out to God for them--"Lord, help this people! They are
   in great straits. They are in frightful difficulties. The enemy says,
   'I will pursue them. I will overtake them. I will divide the spoil. My
   lust shall be satisfied upon them.' Lord, what am I to do with this
   company?" Here comes the Divine answer, full of wisdom and love--"Speak
   unto them and bid them go forward."

   Now such is my message to the company of fugitives who are here
   tonight. You have been awakened. Your conscience has been alarmed. You
   have begun to feel the terrors of the Law. You have heard the crack of
   the whip and felt it on your back. You are trying to escape from your
   sins. You are not as you used to be, a contented bondsman, but you pant
   to be delivered altogether from sin and its power and its guilt. You
   have been flying as best you could from sin. But the whole of your sins
   are after you and your conscience, with its quick ear, can hear the
   sound of threatening judgment. "Alas," your heart is saying, "unless
   God helps me, I shall be in Hell!" "Alas," says your judgment, "unless
   God is merciful, I shall soon perish!" Every power of your manhood is
   now upon the alarm. The different parts of your heart are talking to
   one another and they are all foreboding desperate mischief.

   Now what shall I do for you? Shall I pray for you? Yes, that I will.
   Shall I bid you pray? Yes, that I may. And we may blend our prayers
   together--"God be merciful to us sinners! Lord save us, or we perish!"
   But I think while I am praying for you, I hear my Master saying, "Why
   cry you unto Me?

   Tell them to go forward! Preach Christ to them instead of praying any
   longer or bidding them pray.

   Deliver to them the message of the Gospel--"Forward, Sinner, forward to
   the Cross! Forward to the five wounds! Forward to the bloody sweat and
   to the crown of thorns! Go forward to the agonies of Gethsemane and to
   the death struggles of Golgotha. Forward! Forward to the place--

   'Where the full Atonement's made, Where the utmost ransom's paid.'"

   I know what you say. "Right before me rolls the great sea of God's
   wrath. I am surrounded with a dark, dark night and I see no light but
   the sheen of these terrible waves of fire. If I go forward, God's
   eternal wrath is in the way." Forward, Sinner, whatever may obstruct
   the way! Let not Hell itself block up the road! Do you not know that
   when Jesus is your Leader, He will at once divide the Red sea of
   Jehovah's wrath? He did divide it! He went through it Himself when He
   suffered the wrath of God instead of you!

   As you go forward, you shall find Almighty Justice standing up as a
   protecting wall on either hand and no longer rolling as a devouring
   flood. Forward in the way of faith in the Savior's name! And when you
   have passed through the dry bed of a sea once deep and stormy, you
   shall look back and see the deep sea swallowing up your sins and shall
   sing, "The depths have covered them, there is not one of them left."
   Forward, Sinner, forward! "Well," says one, "I will pray about it."
   Beware of substituting prayer for faith--faith is your present
   duty--Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved. "I will
   think about it a little longer." Do no such thing! Thinking is a very
   poor substitute for believing. Forward! Forward at once and on the
   spot! Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved.

   "But I am not fit to believe!" Forward, in God's name--forward! What
   have you to do with fitness? God commands you to believe in His Son
   Jesus Christ. Forward is my message--I come not here to tamper with
   you--to deal with your "ifs" and "buts," and excuses and perhapses.
   Hell is behind you--you are shut up on the right hand and on the left
   by God's Providence, your own fears, and Divine Justice. There is but
   one way of safety and that is the way of faith. Forward, Sinner!
   Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved!

   Why, some of you have been frittering away your time--weeks and months
   and years! You have been thinking about it, praying about it, reading
   about it, hoping about it, fearing about it--but never coming to Jesus
   just as you are. It is wrong--it is all wrong! God's command is neither
   work, nor feel, nor fear--it is simple and plain--BELIEVE! Forward!
   Trust a Savior's wounds. And in trusting there is life. In a look at
   Him you are saved! O, I wish I could get behind some of you and whisper
   a word in your ear, for I know what Satan says. He says, "Tarry, tarry,
   tarry!" Ah, he loves to have you in the place of breaking forth as
   children, that he may vex and torment you.

   "Go back," he says, "go back!" Ah, I know he would like to have you at
   your cups again and in your old sins, but you cannot go back if God has
   once brought you out of Egypt! I know what he whispers. He says, "It is
   of no use going forward. If you believe in Jesus," says he, "you will
   perish after all." Back, you old Liar, back! God never did permit a man
   yet to walk in a path in which He commanded him to go and not to walk
   safely. Forward, Sinner, FORWARD! Christ is before you and Heaven in
   Him is before you. If you stay where you are, you shall die. If you go
   forward, you can but die. And, therefore, take the captain's word
   tonight, for it is the word of the captain's King--"Speak unto the
   children of Israel that they go forward."

   II. Secondly, we may view the great company who came out of Egypt as AN
   ARMY UNDER COMMAND. Therefore they must obey. The command given to them
   is, "Forward! Forward! Forward!" Might the wise men have said in the
   host of Israel, "How can we go forward? That narrow beach leads down to
   the foaming billow. Forward? What do you mean? We are altogether as
   dead men if we go forward! Would you have us swim? Do you know where
   you are? There are miles and miles of deep water and who knows the
   bottom of the sea? Forward? Absurd!--We shall lose the camels and the
   sheep and the baggage and our wealth and our children and our little
   ones--yes, and our own lives also."

   But thus says the Lord, "Forward!" You came out of Egypt under Moses'
   command, will you play the rebel's part? If the Lord is your Captain,
   you must do absolutely what He bids you at any loss and at any cost. If
   He says, "Forward," and it is into the Red Sea or into a gulf of fire,
   forward you must go. Now, Beloved, this presents us a picture of those
   who are savingly converted, who, on a sudden, meet with difficulties in
   following Christ and run to their minister or to their friend, and say,
   "What are we to do?"

   The Lord's message by me tonight to your anxious inquiry is
   this--"Forward!" It is a simple one--"Forward!" "Sir, I have just begun
   to be a Christian, but if I continue in it, I shall lose my business.
   My calling is such that I cannot be honest in it and serve my God
   faithfully without sinking all my capital and bringing myself and
   family to beggary. What ought I to do? Ought I not to give up my
   religion?" Forward! Forward! No matter what is before you. Forward! You
   are not fit to be a soldier of Christ unless you can count all costs
   and still hold fast to the Cross of Christ.

   "Ah," says one, "but what is to become of my children, my family, my
   household?" Friend, I cannot tell you, but God can. It is yours to
   trust them with Him, for the only command I have for you is, Forward!
   Forward! "But my husband says I shall never come into the house again!
   My father tells me he will turn me out of doors." Be it so, no one
   pities you more than I do. But I dare not alter my message to your
   soul. I am to bid you, Go forward! "Well," says one, "these are hard
   commands."

   Yes, but the martyrs had harder still. Theirs was the stake, the
   gibbet, the rack. They must rot in prison. They must be dragged at the
   heels of the wild horse. But what is the command? "Forward.!" On went
   the goodly host through floods, through fires, through seas of blood.
   They never paused. And if you would be worthy followers of them, you
   must do the same. The Master's message to you is, "Forward!" At the
   famous charge of Balaclava, when the order was given to charge the
   batteries, what could that troop do but ride into the valley of death?
   There they go! On, on, up to the very cannons' mouths! The word of
   command must not be questioned but obeyed--

   "Theirs not to make reply.
   Theirs not to reason why.
   Theirs but to do and die--
   Into the valley of death
   Rode the six hundred."

   And you, if you are fit to be God's soldiers--if you are really His and
   filled with His Holy Spirit--you must do the same. What would you think
   of our soldiers if, when they were bid to charge, they should say,
   "There is a ditch in the way." Jump in it! "But there are soldiers in
   the way." Cut them to pieces! "But they have very sharp fixed
   bayonets." Fix yours, too! Push them at the bayonet's point and drive
   them back. England expects every man to do his duty. What God commands
   must surely have a higher claim on men than what England commands them
   to do! Comrades in arms, all my message to you is, "Forward! Forward!"
   If God has called you to honor and glory and immortality and eternal
   life--if loss of business, comfort, honor, fame, friends. If relatives
   should threaten you, you must not be daunted--for He who loves any of
   these more than Christ is not worthy of Him.

   There are cowards of another sort with whom I must have a word. They do
   not like going forward. They would not lose by it if they did, but they
   feel a quivering sensation of nervousness come over them. And though
   they know their Master's commands, yet they say, "Well, I must think
   the matter over." Now suppose one instance--and I take only one of the
   sort--suppose you know it (as it certainly is, whether you know it or
   not), to be your duty to be baptized? How often I have heard people
   say, "Well, yes, the Lord is my gracious Master and I am His servant
   and I believe it is the duty of Believers to be baptized. But if the
   Lord ever reveals it to me, then I will do it"?

   There is a soldier for you! He is not content to get the same orders as
   his fellow soldiers! No, he cries, "When the regiment is on the march,
   if the captain will come round to my tent and talk to me by myself, I
   will not mind going." Why, he deserves to be flogged as a deserter! I
   will not wish anything hard to my Christian Brothers and Sisters, but I
   do venture to prophesy that they will be beaten with many stripes if
   they talk in that way. "Ah," says one, "but the Lord must apply it to
   me." What for? The thing is clear enough without its being applied. If
   there is anything in the Bible which is plain at all, it is that he who
   believes in Christ should he buried with Him in Baptism. Then, if it is
   your clear duty, you ought to do it at once.

   "Well, I will pray about it." And do you believe God will hear such a
   wicked prayer as that? If I tell my child that there is something for
   him to do and he tells me, "Well, I will think about it." I shall let
   him know that I am not to be thus impudently trifled with. If I say to
   him, Now, my child, do so-and-so. "Father, I will pray about it."
   Believe me, I shall not put up with such hypocritical rebellion! It
   will not do in one's own house, much less in the House of God. Are you
   to be permitted to trifle with positive precepts and then to lay your
   sin upon God's back? I do not think so.

   Dear Brothers and Sisters, if you have been sitting down timidly and
   saying, "Well, one of these days I will come out and own my Lord,"
   instead of that, I am bid to command you on this point and on every
   other, if it is a plain duty, whether it is pleasant to the flesh or
   not, "Forward! Forward! Forward!" What are your marching orders? Does
   your Lord tell you to do it? Do it! Do the Scriptures bid you? Do it!
   It is not yours to reason why any more than it is the soldier's. But as
   the seed of Israel marched right on, even though the sea was in their
   way, so must you--though death itself should be the result. "Speak to
   the children of Israel, that they go forward."

   III. We will change the topic once again and we will take a third view
   of it. Let us view these people as ON THE MARCH TOWARDS CANAAN. Many of
   you are on your way towards Heaven and the Lord's command to you is,
   "Forward! Forward!"

   I would that I could sound that one word in the ears of many whom I
   believe to be the Lord's people but who have for a long time settled
   upon their lees. There are some persons who cannot be persuaded to make
   an advance in the Divine life. The moment you urge them to anything
   practical they call you legal. They seem to consider themselves as
   inanimate clay ordained to lie passively in the hands of the Holy
   Spirit. But they forget that the Holy Spirit works in us, not to be
   idle and powerless, but to will and to do of God's good pleasure. They
   neither will, nor do, but talk about the Spirit as though He were to
   will and to do everything for them.

   To such who have been converted but have made no progress let me, in my
   Master's name, give clear utterance to that word, "Forward." Brothers
   and Sisters, you and I ought to go forward in knowledge. If I know no
   more of Scripture than I did ten years ago, what have I done with my
   time? If I am no better instructed myself as a scribe in my Master's
   kingdom, of what use shall I be to others? If you have been in this
   world these years and yet doctrine has not become more clear, nor
   experience more plain it is time you should look about you and follow
   on to know the Lord. We do not keep boys at school year after year if
   they make no progress. And yet how many there are of professing
   Christians who seem to have been stunted in their early profession so
   that they positively have not advanced in knowledge one iota beyond
   where they were ten or twenty years ago? In this point, however, they
   are not so much to blame as in others.

   "Forward," should be the motto as to our faith. You were doubting and
   fearing twenty years ago. If I recollect, when I was but a lad ten
   years ago, I heard you lament--

   "It is a point I long to know,
   Oft it causes anxious thought."
   Have you not a better time than that now?
   Can you not sing--

   "A debtor to mercy alone,
   Of Co venant mercy I sing;
   Nor fear with Your righteousness on,
   My person and offerings to bring--
   The terrors of Law and of God,
   With me can have nothing to do;
   My Savior's obedience and blood
   Hide all my transgressions from view."

   I do not suppose you will altogether be rid of fears, but I do think
   your motto should be--"Forward!"--that your faith should become more
   constant and your doubts less frequent. Surely the venerable saint who
   has proved his Master a hundred times ought to find his faith more
   strong than those of us who are but babes in the family! Ought we to be
   always limping, always hoping and trusting, doubting and fearing? Is it
   not time for us to use the strong muscles of the fully developed
   man--and, leaving all nursery carts--ought we not to stand upright with
   Abraham with a faith which staggers not because of unbelief? Forward,
   Christian, forward as to your faith!

   May I not use the same word in reference to our fellowship with Christ?
   I am afraid most of us make no progress as to nearness to Christ. Some
   of us, I am afraid, go backwards. We said, years ago, "Nearer, my God,
   to You, nearer to You." Are we nearer? Have we come closer to the
   wounds of Jesus? Do we more frequently recline upon His bosom and sit
   at His feet? If not, I am commanded with Moses, "Speak unto the
   children of Israel, that they go forward."

   Above all, have we made any progress as to work for our Master? Some,
   as they grow old, give up their work. I do not understand it! I must
   confess an inability of comprehending how any man who once preached the
   Gospel can ever leave his ministry while his strength lasts. If the
   Master has once allotted you a field of labor, unless it is sheer
   inability, I cannot understand how you can ever cease to till the
   ground, or reap the sheaves. No, you will, if God has called you, want
   to do more and more and more for Jesus!

   You will feel a growing thirst after precious souls--at least you ought
   to. You will be moved with greater yearnings of your heart towards your
   fellow immortals and a higher zeal for the spread of your Master's
   kingdom. Christian men, when I think of some of you who have tasted
   that He is gracious, and are content with the taste. You who have been
   into the river of Jesus' love until you are up to the ankles, but are
   loath to wade into the deeper parts of the heavenly stream. When I
   think of some of you who are worshipping in the outer courts and have
   no ambition to enter into that which is within the veil. When I
   remember how some of you seem never to comprehend the resurrection
   life, nor what it is to be raised up together to sit in heavenly places
   in Christ Jesus--I do marvel at you that you thus stand back and in the
   name of God, whose servant I am, I give you this motto--"Forward!
   Forward!"

   Press onward in the Divine life! Forget the road already trod and
   onward urge your way. Cry for the Spirit of God! Ask for more unction,
   more power, more consciousness of the Divine indwelling and then take
   for the motto on your banner--"Forward! Forward! Forward!"

   IV. In the fourth place, but with very great brevity, TO CHRISTIANS IN
   TROUBLE our text is applicable. The children of Israel were in great
   straits. They were in a trial into which God had brought them. And it
   is an absolute certainty that if God brings you in, He will bring you
   out. He never did take a saint where he must of necessity perish. The
   rocks of daily life rise on the right and on the left. The raging enemy
   is behind. The equally raging sea is before. What is to be done now?
   God's word is--"Forward!"

   God shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace. In this vast
   assembly there may be several Christians who said to themselves last
   Saturday night, "I will go up to the House of God and enquire at the
   hand of the man of God what the Lord will do for me." This is the
   answer to your enquiry. You cannot help yourself--that is clear. Your
   trouble is none of your own finding--that you know. And your escape
   will not be of your own working--that you know, also. You have nothing
   now to do but to cast yourselves upon your God and go forward!

   Beloved, it is a blessed thing to be absolutely stripped of creature
   comforts that you may be wholly clothed upon with the Creator. It is
   not pleasing to flesh and blood to be brought down to abject
   nothingness. But faith never is more happy than when the strength of
   the mortal is altogether dead--because then the immortal God comes in
   and clothes our weakness with His Omnipotence. If I might have any
   choice between having abundant wealth, or being brought to absolute
   dependence upon daily supplies. If in the latter case I could have
   greater power to exhibit and to exert faith in Christ, I must confess
   that I should prefer the mode of living which would give me most room
   to enjoy the luxury of depending upon my God.

   I believe it is more happy and more Divine a life to live from hand to
   mouth, dependent upon the Providence of God and having the confidence
   to trust Him, than it is to have all the abundance of this world but to
   have nothing about which faith may exercise itself. Often when our joys
   are thick about us and we have ten thousand creature comforts, we are
   then naked and poor and miserable in spirituals. But when the creature
   comforts fall as the leaves are falling from the trees in autumn, then
   it is that we have frequently the most joy and the most peace in God.
   "Give me back my sickbed," said a saint when he remembered what joy he
   had had upon it!

   Theodoret, the martyr, said that his persecutors had done him an injury
   when they took him off the rack. "For," said he, "while I was on the
   rack, God sent His angels to comfort me. And now you have taken me off,
   I am afraid I shall lose their heavenly presence." Experimentally I
   have learned, dear Friends, that at the Red Sea of affliction we see
   most of the right arm of God. I am glad there was a Red Sea! I bless
   God that it had deep and foaming billows! I praise His name that there
   were fierce and cruel Egyptians--for if there had never been that Red
   Sea, never would the song of Moses and the shout of Miriam have been
   heard--"Sing unto the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously: the horse
   and his rider has He thrown into the sea."

   Your tribulations will yet yield you music. All you have to do now is
   to honor God by going forward! Hold your peace and God shall fight for
   you! "Be still and know that I am God." When the worst has come to the
   worst, that God--

   "Who moves in a mysterious way His wonders to perform, Will plant His
   footsteps in the sea, And ride upon the storm. Forward! Christian,
   forward!"

   V. Let me not weary you, but I must, again, use my text in another
   manner--for the exhortation of all of you who are followers of my Lord
   and Master. THE ISRAELITES WERE UPON A DIVINE MISSION. They were going
   up to slay the Canaanites, Hivites, Jebusites and Hittites. They must
   all be slain with the sharp sword of Israel. But a difficulty rolls
   between them and their prey! The message, however, of God's captain, is
   still, "Forward! Forward!"

   My Brothers and Sisters, let me specially address you who are
   associated in Church fellowship here. Some of you will remember when I
   came up from the country. I remember better than you do, for I have
   hidden these things in my heart. A child, almost a babe, I came into
   your place of worship which was half empty, no, not one-sixth full. You
   may, some of you, remember that sermon when the youth preached of the
   faithfulness of God and tried to magnify Divine Immutability. I believe
   the note of the charge that morning, was, "Forward!"

   Hope was kindled in the breasts of many. The few there who were
   faithful to the cause hoped and believed that God had better days for
   them and we took heart. You will remember, some of you, when the people
   began to throng the aisles. Within three or four Sundays, when the
   place was full, our cry was "Forward!" We had more Prayer Meetings,
   more earnestness every day! I recollect it was thought a strange thing
   to see such zeal! Then we wanted to enlarge the Chapel. And one Sunday
   evening, preaching from that text--"By faith the walls of Jericho fell
   down"--when certain ones had objected to any alteration because it was
   a mere spasm, a mere excitement--the young lad from the country would
   soon be forgotten--I said concerning that wall at the back, "By faith
   this wall will fall down," for our motto was "Forward!"

   We held a little meeting, raised the money at once--down went the
   wall--the place was enlarged. The enlargement was of no use, our motto
   was, "Forward!" God opened the doors of Exeter Hall to us. We went
   there. The place was crowded, multitudes of souls were converted. The
   Church increased--did we stop? Our motto was "Forward!" The Surrey Hall
   was proposed to us, a larger structure. We went about it and we said,
   "This is too immense a place, too bold a venture."

   I thought in my own mind, "The place will never be filled." You
   remember we still dared it, for our motto was "Forward!" Then came a
   crushing blow, a terrible disaster which seemed to shatter us all and,
   most of all, the man who was called to take the brunt of the battle. He
   was laid upon the ground all broken-hearted and wretched by the
   catastrophe, but God suffered him not to lose heart! He rose from the
   dust of despondency. The Spirit of the Lord was upon him. His cry was
   "Forward!" And once again he stood among you and again the thousands
   gathered and on, on, on, from that time, "Forward!" has been the cry.

   "We will build a tabernacle," said we. Thirty thousand pounds! We stood
   back. Where would it come from? "The silver and the gold are Mine," was
   the promise of God. Some bold hearts went on, for our motto was
   "Forward!" And we prayed and worked and believed and lo--we entered
   this spacious house without a debt and we worship in it, remembering
   that of our own we gave unto God and that this goodly structure is a
   proof of the power of faith. Our motto was still "Forward!"

   The pastor took one or two young men to educate. He soon had a dozen.
   He asked your help, you helped him. He had a score. Some said it was
   too many. He had forty--before long fifty--now seventy. And still the
   cry is, "Forward! Forward!" What I want to do tonight is just to stir
   your souls with a little of the old enthusiasm, to scatter among you
   some coals of that holy fire which once set you in a blaze. "Forward!
   Forward!" is what we want! Brethren, we want to be doing more for
   Christ!

   Compared with our congregation I believe we are doing much, but still
   not what we might do--not what we ought to do. Here is this great city
   teeming with its multitudes and the proportion of evangelistic work
   which we take is far too small. "Forward! Forward!" At this time we
   have men ready to preach the Word. But we do not know where to find the
   room for them. There are rich men in this congregation and men in
   middling circumstances who might take a little room and pay the rent
   and let some young man come and preach in it and try to raise a Church
   in a destitute neighborhood. Some of you might cry, "Forward!" and do
   that.

   Others of you in the Providence of God live in poor neighborhoods and
   you may have a room which holds twenty, perhaps. Could you not let some
   one preach in it? Preaching is the great weapon of God for pulling down
   strongholds. It will pull down the largest blocks of stone the enemy
   can pile together. Preach the Gospel, the gates of Hell shake! Preach
   the Gospel, prodigals return! Preach the Gospel to every creature--it
   is the Master's mandate and it is the Master's power--"the power of God
   unto salvation unto everyone that believes."

   I would I could make every member of this Church feel in earnest about
   doing good. Do you not long to win souls? Do you not desire to spend
   and to be spent for your Master? I will venture to say that if you do
   not, you are not worthy of membership with such a Church as this! If no
   Divine zeal stirs you. If no heavenly fire has fallen on your soul, you
   might find a more congenial place of rest among some dull and sluggish
   people who care not for God. As for my own soul, God knows how I yearn
   over souls--I work and if there is any man living who can work more for
   God than I do, I envy him his strength and endurance!

   It is not twelve, nor thirteen, nor fourteen, or fifteen hours a day
   which will satisfy me in the service of my Master. I wish I could be
   cut in pieces to preach His Gospel and that every drop of blood might
   tell it to my perishing fellow men. As I cannot do that, I do love to
   see my young men preaching the Word of God. They are so many new mouths
   for me, so many tongues for some of you who have no power of speech for
   your Master. They speak for you, if you have a share in their
   maintenance. But, oh, what I can do seems to be nothing but
   contributing a drop, but taking out a cupful from the great see of the
   world's sorrow and the world's sin!

   Do help me! Do help me, I pray you! Brethren, pray for us! If you can
   do nothing else, pray that the Spirit of God may rest upon us in our
   preaching and in our efforts to extend His Kingdom--and may every one
   of you take a hand in this good work. I would sooner have half of you
   and have you all alive and earnest, than have the whole of you and have
   some of you a drag upon the wheels. If this Church does not serve
   God--mark these words, I speak, I think, prophetically--God will make
   this House a hissing and write "Ichabod" upon these walls!

   Never was a Church more favored than you have been! For more than two
   hundred years God has given you a succession of faithful pastors. We
   have, each of us in our, lot strived to do our work. We have stood upon
   the walls of Zion and those who have gone before, at least, have not
   been found unfaithful. And as God helps me, neither will I be
   unfaithful either to God's Truth or to the souls of men.

   But if with such appliances--with such preaching of the Gospel and
   helped so marvelously--and so many of you great sinners saved from
   great sins, having had much forgiven. If you do not love much and serve
   much, O my God, let me not live to see the curse fall upon this Church!
   But at least in my day let the blessing continue! Yes, and when this
   head sleeps among the clods of the valley, find them better men than we
   are to preach the Word and let this Church still be a star in Your
   right hand to shine amidst the thick darkness of the world!

   Dear Friends, if you are not in earnest about this, I am. Oh, we must
   not let this opportunity pass! There is much which you can do. I want
   you to help the heathen world, but I want you to begin with caring for
   this great heathen world of London. And if you can do nothing else, at
   least give us your prayers.

   VI. I have done when I shall say that soon you and I will stand on the
   brink of Jordan's river. The deep sea of death will roll before us.
   Trusting in Jesus, washed in His blood, hoping in His mercy we shall
   not fear the last solemn hour. We shall hear the angel say, "Forward!"
   We shall touch the chilly stream with our feet, the flood shall fly,
   and we shall go through the stream dry-shod. If the flood gathers and
   the Jordan overflows its banks, still the Divine watchword, "Forward!"
   shall speed us on and we will enter Heaven's gates among the
   blood-washed throng and sing unto Him who has enabled us to triumph
   gloriously in obedience to that command, "Forward! Forward!" God help
   you to go forward and unto Him be praise forever and ever. Amen.

                        A Desperate Case--How to Meet It

   A Sermon

   (No. 549)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, January 10th, 1864, by the

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we
   cast him out? And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for
   verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye
   shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it
   shall remove: and nothing shall be impossible unto you. Howbeit this
   kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting."--Matthew 17:19-21.

   THE NARRATIVE, of which our text forms a part, describes a scene which
   took place immediately after the transfiguration of our Lord. Not to
   divorce it therefore from its connection, let us glance at the
   antecedents of the case, that nothing may be lost by negligence, or
   that peradventure we may gain something by meditation.

   How great the difference between Moses and Christ! When Moses had been
   forty days upon the mountaintop, he underwent a kind of
   transfiguration, so that his face shone with exceeding brightness when
   he came down among the people, and he was obliged to put a veil over
   his face; for they could not bear to look upon his glory. Not so our
   Saviour! He had been really transfigured with a greater glory than
   Moses could ever know, and yet, as he came down from the mount,
   whatever radiance shone upon his face, it is not written that the
   people could not look upon him, but rather they were amazed, and
   running to him, they saluted him. The glory of the law repelled; for
   the majesty of holiness and justice, drive the awed spirits away from
   God. But the greater glory of Jesus attracts; though he is holy, and
   just, and righteous too, yet blended with these there is so much of
   truth and grace that sinners run to Jesus, amazed at his goodness,
   attracted by the charming fascination of his love, and they salute him,
   become his disciples, and take him to be their Lord and Master. Some of
   you may be just now blinded by the dazzling brightness of the law of
   God. You feel its claims on your conscience, but you cannot keep it in
   your life. It is too high; you cannot attain to it. Not that you find
   fault with the law; on the contrary, it commands your profoundest
   esteem. Still you are in no wise drawn by it to God; you are rather
   hardened in your heart, and you may be verging towards the inference of
   desperation: "As it is impossible for me to earn salvation by the works
   of the law, I will continue in my sins." Ah, poor heart! Turn thine eye
   away from Moses, with all his repelling splendour, and look to Jesus,
   yonder, crucified for sinful men. Behold his flowing wounds, and thorn
   crowned head! He is the Son of God, and therein he is greater than
   Moses. He bear the wrath of God, and therein he shows more of God's
   justice than Moses' broken tablets could ever do. Look thou to him, and
   as thou feelest the attraction of his love, fly to his arms and thou
   shalt be saved.

   How different the spirit of Moses and Jesus! When Moses comes down from
   the mountain, it is to purge the camp. He seems to grasp the fiery
   sword; he breaks the golden calf; he smites the idolaters; but when
   Jesus comes down from the mountain, he finds a strife in the camp, as
   Moses did; he finds his own apostles worsted and beaten, just as Aaron
   had been defeated by the clamours of the people; but he has not a word
   of cursing; there is a gentle rebuke--"O faithless and perverse
   generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you?"
   His actions are actions of mercy--no breaking in pieces, but healing;
   no cursing, but blessing: love sits smiling on his brow, as he touches
   the poor wretch who is almost dead with diabolical possession, and
   restores him to life and health. Go you then, to Jesus; leave the law
   and your own self-righteousness, for these can do nothing but curse
   you. Fly to Jesus, for be you whomsoever you may, there are pardons on
   his lips; there are blessings in his hands; there is love in his heart;
   and he will not disdain to receive even you.

   How much of condescension there is in the manner of Christ! Our Lord,
   we have told you, had been very glorious on the mountain's top, with
   Moses and Elias, yet, when he comes down into the midst of the crowd,
   he doth not disdain the cry of the poor man, not refuse to touch him
   who was possessed with a devil. Observe my Masters condescension, for
   he deigns attention, and yet his manner softens into pity and presently
   it melts into a gracious sympathy, as if this was the only channel
   through which his peerless power could flow. Then remember, he is the
   same to-day as he was then.

   "Now though he reigns exalted high,

   His love is still as great:"--

   He is willing now to receive sinners as when it was said of him, "This
   man receiveth sinners and eateth with them:" just as ready to receive
   you, poor sinners, as when he was called "The friend of publicans and
   sinners." Come to him. Bow at his feet. His love invites you still.
   Believe that the transfigured and glorified Jesus is still a loving
   Saviour, willing to pardon and forgive.

   Once again what choice instruction there is in history! After Jesus had
   been absent for some time, he came back. You may ask for what purpose
   he had retired? Evidently he went up into the mountain to pray. It was
   while he was praying (and I make no doubt, fasting likewise) that the
   fashion of his countenance changed. By his own personal devotion, and
   by the Father's special revelation, he had thus come back, as it were,
   with great refreshment to carry on his ministry. Hence we become
   witnesses of a marvelous power which he immediately showed forth, and
   of no less remarkable counsel which he spoke to his disciples, when
   they felt their own weakness. Thus we have before us, on our text, a
   peculiar case--a patient, who utterly baffled the skill of all his
   disciples, healed at once by the great Master; and we have a reason
   given why the apostles themselves were not able to deliver him.

   Let us look for a little time at this very sad case; not so singular
   either, methinks, but that we may find the round about us. Then let us
   notice the scene around the case--the father, the disciples, the
   scribes. Afterwards we shall joyfully observe the Saviour's coming into
   the midst and deciding all the difficulty; and, lastly, we shall attend
   to the reason he gives in private to his disciples, why they, before
   his coming, were utterly powerless to achieve the work.

   I. First we have before us a VERY PECULIAR CASE.

   It appears that the disciples had cast out devils of all sorts.
   Wherever they had gone, heretofore, this was their uniform testimony,
   "Lord, even the devils are subject unto us;" but now they are baffled.
   They seem to have encountered a devil of the worst kind. There are
   grades in devilry as there are in human sin. All men are evil, but all
   men are not alike evil. All devils are full of sin, but they are not
   all sinful to the same degree. Do we not read in Scripture, "Then goeth
   he and taketh unto him seven other spirits more wicked than himself?"
   It may be there is a gradation in the wickedness of devils, and
   perhaps, also, in their power to fulfil their wicked impulses. We can
   scarcely think that all devils are Satans. There seems to be one chief
   arch-spirit, one great Diabolus, who is an accuser of the brethren--one
   mighty Lucifer, who fell down from heaven and has become the prince of
   the powers of darkness. In all his hosts it is probable that there is
   not his like. He stands first and chief of those fallen morning stars;
   the rest of the spirits may stand in different grades of wickedness, a
   hierarchy of hell. This poor wretch seems to have been possessed of one
   of the worst, most potent, and violent, and virulent of these evil
   spirits. I believe, brethren, that here we have a picture of a certain
   class of individuals who are not only desperately sinful, but subject
   to extraordinary impulses which carry them to infernal lengths and
   depths of infamy; they are incapable of restraint, a terror to their
   kinfolk, and a misery to themselves. All men are sinful, as I have said
   before; but the power of depravity in some men is much stronger than in
   others; at least, if it be not intrinsically stronger, yet it certainly
   has manifestations in some which we have never perceived in common
   among men. Let us try and pick out the case according to the narrative.
   How frequently, dear friends, too frequently, alas! have we seen young
   people who have answered to the description here given. They have had a
   precocity of wickedness. When Jesus asked the father, "How long has he
   been in this way?" the answer was, "Of a child." I remember having once
   known such a child, over whom, paroxysms of passion came, in which his
   face would turn black. When he was able to run about, and was sent to a
   public school, a flint-stone, a club, a brick-bat, anything which might
   come next to hand, he would throw, without a moment's thought, at any
   one who vexed him. His knife would be drawn from his pocket and opened
   in an instant. The young assassin has often been prevented from
   stabbing others by a careful hand and watchful eye which guarded him.
   We have noticed this, I say, in the very young. They begin to lie early
   and to thieve soon, and the young lip even assays to swear, while the
   anxious mother cannot understand where the child could have learnt it.
   You have protected such a child from contamination, and seemed to shut
   him in and girdle him about with holy influences; and yet, in these
   desperate instances, as soon as ever the child could know the right
   from the wrong, he has deliberately chosen the wrong with a violence of
   self-will and recklessness of consequences altogether unusual. Some
   such cases we have seen. O, may God grant it never be your lot or mine,
   to be the parents of such children. Yet such there have been, and such
   men there are who have grown up now, and the youthful passions of their
   childhood have become developed; and you may find them with the low
   forehead and dark scowling eye, if you will, in our prison-houses. Or
   if you see them in the streets, you may hopefully wish that they may be
   in prison ere long, for they are unsafe abroad. Of a child they seem to
   have been possessed with the chief of devils, and to have been carried
   captive by him at his will.

   This lad seems also to have been afflicted with what is here called
   lunacy, which was, indeed, only a form of epilepsy. He was constantly
   subjected, it seems, to epileptic fits; for I think we can hardly
   understand lunacy to mean anything short of occasional madness. Attacks
   of such outrageous violence would come upon him, that there would be no
   enduring him. He would then dash himself into the fire, or if water
   were near, he would attempt self destruction by plunging in to it. We
   have met with persons of this kind, perfectly outrageous and beyond all
   command, when fits of evil came upon them. I will instance cases which
   I have observed.

   I know a man now, he may be here this morning; if he is , he will
   recognize his own portrait. At times he is as reasonable as anyone I
   could wish to associate with. He enjoys listening to the Word of God.
   He is, in some respects, an amiable, excellent, and respectable man.
   But occasionally fits of drunkenness come upon him, in which he is
   perfectly powerless under the influence of the demon; and while it
   lasts, it matters not, even when he knows he is wrong, a thousand
   angels could not drag him from it. He is thrown into the water of
   self-destruction, and he will continue in it. You may urge him and
   reason with him, and you may think--oh, how often some have thought who
   love him!--he will never do that again; he is too sensible a man; he
   has been too well-taught; the Word of God has had such an effect upon
   him, that he will never do it again; yet he does; he repeats the old
   paroxysms, and has done for twenty or thirty years; and, if he lives,
   unless sovereign grace prevent it, he will die a drunkard, as sure as
   he is a living man, and go from his drink to damnation.

   Another case, from which I likewise draw from life. The man is kind,
   tender, and generous--generous to a fault. He has a home--he had one, I
   ought to say--he had a home, and he was the light of it. No one ever
   suspected him--that is, in his better times--of any grievous faults;
   but sometimes--and this has been concealed by many an indulgent
   friend--an attack of lasciviousness comes upon him, and at such seasons
   it matters not what the temptation may be, nor how foul the vice may
   be, the man runs into it. If you should meet him in the street, and
   talk with him, and argue with him, it would be all time and labour
   thrown away; nay, I have known him break up his home, and cross the sea
   to go to another land, that he might indulge his vile passions without
   rebuke, or the restraint of associating with former friends. He will
   come back again, broken-hearted, wondering that he ever could be such a
   fool; but he will go again. It is in him. The devil is in him, and,
   unless God casts it out, he will do the same again, deliberately
   choosing his own damnation. Though he knows it, yet so possessed of the
   love of sin is he, that when the fit comes upon him, this diabolical
   epilepsy, he falls into sin with his whole might and power.

   I might go on describing cases of the kind, but you will not need that
   I should picture any more; it could only be to vary the different forms
   of sin. However, let me try once more. A lad had as good a father as a
   child could have. He was bound apprentice. It became whispered in a few
   weeks that little moneys were missing. The father was very grieved, so
   indeed was the master, and the matter was quietly hushed up. A little
   while after the same thing occurred. The indentures were cancelled, and
   nothing more was said of it; but the father was sorely perplexed. He
   looked out for some other situation for the boy where he might,
   perhaps, recover his character. After a time it was precisely the same
   again. Bad companions had got hold of him, or rather, he had become a
   ringleader among other bad companions. Well, something else must be
   tried. It was tried. He has had twenty situations, and they have all
   been thrown up from the very same cause. And now, what think you is his
   treatment of his parents? Instead of being grateful for the repeated
   kindness and longsuffering shown to him, he will break out sometimes
   into such dreadful passions, that even the lives of his parents are
   scarcely safe; and when he has been in his old haunts a little more
   than usual, he is really so terrible a being, that his mother who loves
   him and who weeps over him, would almost as soon see a fiend from hell
   as see him; for when he comes home, everything goes wrong; confusion,
   is in the house, and terror in every heart; he acts precisely as if he
   were a madman. They have said, "Send him to Australia, or send him to
   America"--where they do send many of that sort--but if he goes there he
   will turn up, sooner or later, at the foot of the gallows; he is
   desperately set on evil, and nothing turns him aside. He tears and
   foams at the mouth with passion; his whole heart goes forth
   outrageously after anything like vice, and there appears to be not one
   redeeming trait in his character; or, if there be, it only seems to be
   subjected tot he power his lusts. He devises means to be more mighty to
   do mischief in the world.

   What dreadful cases these are! Wherefore am I talking of them? Dear
   friends , I have taken them because it has been laying upon my heart to
   encourage and comfort you who are constrained to carry a daily cross in
   having such relations and such children as these. It is one of the
   heaviest afflictions which can come upon you.

   In the case before us, the child was both deaf and dumb--not, I
   suppose, through any organic effect, but through the epilepsy, and the
   Satanic possession. So often we have seen children--shall I look them
   in the face this morning, as I stand here?--they are no children
   now--who are positively deaf to all spiritual sounds. They have been
   pleaded with, but it is vain. They know the truth, they know the whole
   truth, but they do not know the power of it. They are never absent from
   family prayer, nor in any prayer are they ever forgotten by their
   parents. They come to this place; they attend our classes; they go to
   revival services. Now and then there is something like a little
   emotion, but it does not come to much; they are precisely similar to
   the deaf adder which cannot be charmed, charm we never so wisely.
   Others of the family have been converted. Nearly all the household has
   now been brought to Christ. Lydia has had her heart opened; God has
   been much pleased to call young Timothy; but this one remains, and
   after much anxiety, much effort, much labour, no good has been
   achieved. The adamant seems as soft as their heart, and the ear of the
   deaf as much alive to rebuke as their conscience. This again is a very
   sad case.

   I meet sometimes, too, with cases of another kind--persons who are
   beset with very high doctrine, who have got the devil in them, puffing
   up their fleshly minds with a vain conceit of sound understanding, and
   degrading their carnal profession with a loathsome impurity of heart
   and life. You will talk with them; they will tell you they wish to be
   saved--would give their right arm to be saved; but it is not in their
   power. You bid them believe in Jesus. They have no sense, they tell
   you, of the need of a Saviour; they are not in a fit state to believe.
   When God's time comes, the thing will occur. They love high doctrine;
   they will hear nothing else but it; but then their Sunday, if there is
   a temptation which comes across their path, will be spent anywhere but
   in the worship of God; and during the week they give way to all sorts
   of sins. Whatever temptation comes, they go after it. The comfort they
   get from their religion, which they wrap about them like a cloak, is
   this--that no minister speaks the truth except one or two; that the
   truth is fatalism; that all they have to do is to be carried along like
   dead, inanimate logs down the stream, and that they are not at all
   responsible; or if they are responsible, it is merely to maintain with
   unflinching hardihood their own crude sentiments. I have seen some of
   these people--good people in their own way too--of whom I have thought
   that the conversation of drunkards was more hopeful than theirs; for
   that damnable fatalism, which by some is put instead of the
   predestination of the Scriptures, has locked them up--put them in an
   iron cage: and so they are beyond the reach of help, going on in their
   sin, rejecting the gospel of Christ, while assaying to be connoisseurs
   of its choicest mysteries.

   Now, brothers and sisters, why are such cases as these permitted? Why
   doth the Lord allow the devil thus to fill the soul with sin?

   I think it is, first, to show that there is a reality of sin. If we
   were all moral and outwardly respectable, we should begin to think sin
   was but a fancy. These daring sinners show the reality of it.

   It is to manifest the reality of divine grace; for when these are
   saved, then it is we wonder, and we are compelled to say, "There is
   something in this. If such a hard, iron nature yet melts before the
   power of divine love, there must be a majesty in it."

   It is to humble us too, to throw us on our back, and let us see how
   utterly powerless human agency is. When you cannot get in the thin end
   of the wedge, much less the whole wedge; when the ploughshare breaks on
   the edge of a hard rock; when the edge of the sword turns against the
   armour, then it is to draw yourself out of self to God. You see it is a
   deadly evil, where only omnipotence can help. Your soul says, "Lord,
   put out thine arm! Now do it, and the glory shall be thine." This is
   probably the chief reason; it is in order that God may get great glory
   to himself. He lets the devil have it all his own way. "There," he
   says, "pick your own ground, fight in your own territory, manoeuvre in
   your own way, and, with a word, I will crush your power." He gives
   Satan great advantage, lets him entrench himself firmly in the soul
   from youth up, so that the victory may be splendid to the greatest
   degree.

   We have thus before us now, for our sorrowful contemplation, the case
   of one whose disease mocks the physician, laughs at all human
   endeavours, and defies the watchful care of mild and gentle treatment
   to mitigate its force, or ameliorate its fearful symptoms.

   II. Turn we now with passing glance, to LOOK AT THE SCENE AROUND. The
   company is made up of five sorts of people.

   There are the scribes--cynics, methinks, to a man--"We told you so! We
   told you so!" they say. "Your Master pretended to give you power to
   cast out devils. No such thing! you cannot cast out devils. Those whom
   you healed were not truly possessed. Little enough was ever the matter
   with them, and so they got better. They were fanciful, and they
   believed you through enthusiasm. The dupes of credulity, your
   incantations bewitched them, and so they got better. But you cannot
   cast out a devil--you cannot cast that devil out." "Now then," says one
   of the scribes to Andrew, "cast it out. Come, Phillip, try what you can
   do!" And inasmuch as after all trying, the devil would not go out--"Ah!
   just so!" they say, "they are impostors. There is nothing in it" Just
   recall it, friends, to your own memories, have not you seen men of that
   kind? "Ah yes," they say, " the gospel converts one sort of people,
   such as always go to places of worship, the more intelligent and
   respectable of the community, but, you see, it is no good in these
   tough cases. These hardened ones--it cannot touch them. They are beyond
   its power." "Aha!" they say, "where is the boasted might of this great
   physician? He can heal your finger-aches; he does not know how to make
   these foul diseases fly."

   Then here is the poor father, all dejected. "I brought him to you--I
   knew you did cast out devils, and I thought you could cast my son's
   devil out, and he would be healed. I am disappointed in you all. Yet I
   do think your Master can do it, but I am not sure that even he can. If
   such excellent apostles, as you are, have tried so hard, and have
   failed, I do not think there can be any chance for me. I am full of
   unbelief. O, I wish I had never brought my child here at all, to make a
   public spectacle of him, that he might be a witness to your failures."
   That is the poor father. Perhaps that poor father is here this morning
   and he is saying, "Ah, I do believe, but still I am full of unbelief. I
   have brought my daughter; I have brought my child under the sound of
   the Word; I have prayed, and wrestled with God in prayer, and my child
   is not saved." "I have brought my husband," says one good woman, "but
   he is just as full of Satan as he ever was. I must give it up in
   despair."

   And then, there are the disciples, and they look pitiable indeed.
   "Well," they say, "we do not know how to account for it. We cannot tell
   you how it is. We have said the same in this case that we were wont to
   say in others." "Why" says one of them, "when I went abroad and just
   said In the name of Jesus Christ I command thee to come out of him,'
   the unclean spirit always did come out in every other case. I cannot
   comprehend this. I must give it up." "We all must give it up," says the
   apostles. For some unknown cause, this seems to be quite out of the
   catalogue of cases which we are commissioned to cure. And so we
   sometimes hear dejected ministers, after preaching long at such hard
   shells as these--they say, "Well, we cannot understand it. The gospel
   is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.' Oh, it
   must be that these are fore-ordained unto damnation; we must give it
   up." That is how unbelieving ministers talk--or at least the most part
   of ministers in their season of misgiving and chagrin.

   But then there is the general crowd. They are neither this way nor
   that. They say they will see fair. "Come, clear the ring out. If Jesus
   Christ be not an impostor--if he be God--certainly he can heal this
   poor man." Now here is the test and the ordeal, "If that man be not
   healed, we," says the crowd, "will not believe; but, if he be, then we
   will believe that Jesus Christ is sent of God." O dear friends, how
   often we have thought of those very hard cases in this way. There are
   hundreds of undecided people looking on and saying, "Ah, if So-and-so
   were converted, then I should say there was something in it. If truly
   we could have a new heart and a right spirit, then I, too, would turn
   to God with full purpose of heart.

   There was the fifth party there, and that was the devil himself. Oh,
   how triumphant was he! "Ah!" he seemed to say, "try your exorcism; go
   on with your words; preach at him; pray at me; weep over me; do what
   you will, you cannot get me out." There he seems to stand intrenched
   within the stronghold of the poor tortured heart. "Do your best, do
   your worst, I am not afraid of you. I have got this man, and I will
   keep him. I have so fixed myself in him that no power shall ever be
   able to heal him." So we seem to hear that vile shriek of hell over
   some men, "Yes," saith he, "I will trust him to go into Spurgeon's
   Tabernacle. I know the thousands there have felt the power of the Holy
   Ghost in making new men of them, this is a case I can trust. There is
   nothing that will ever touch him. The great hammer has knocked the
   chains off many, but it cannot touch his chains; they are harder than
   iron. I have no fear for him;" and perhaps he is gloating his thoughts
   now with the torments of the man in another world. Ah, thou foul fiend!
   if our Master should come here this morning, thou shouldst sing another
   tune. if he should say, "Come out of him thou foul spirit," thou wilt
   go back howling to thy vile den; for his voice can do what our voice
   never could have done. And may we not easily realize such a scene
   enacted in this congregation? You have the scoffers, you have the
   anxious parent, the ministry confessedly powerless in the matter; the
   crowd looking on, and the devil rejoicing that such cases are quite
   beyond human strength. What more can you want to vivify the picture
   before your imagination?

   III. But look! THE MASTER COMES.

   Ah! the master comes! Forthwith the scene changes. The lieutenants and
   the captains who began the battle did not understand the art of war;
   the were precipitant and hasty. The right wing was broken; the left
   began to reel; the centre almost fails. The trumpets of the adversary
   begin to sound a victory. Here they come--their dread artillery in
   front. What will become of the army now? Hold! Hold! What is that I
   see? A cloud of dust. Who comes galloping there? It is the
   commander-in-chief. "What are you at?" says he, "What are you at?" In a
   moment he sees this is not the way to fight. He comprehends the
   difficulties of the case in an instant. "Forward there! Forward There!
   Backward there!" The scale is turned. The mere presence of the
   commander-in-chief has changed the whole face of the field; and now, ye
   adversaries, ye may turn your backs and fly. It was so in Jesus' case
   exactly. His lieutenants and captains--the apostles--had lost the day.
   He comes into the field; comprehends the state of the case. "Bring him
   hither to me," says he, and the poor wretch, foaming and tormented, is
   brought to him, and he says, "Come out of him, thou unclean spirit."
   The thing is done; the victory achieved; the undecided receive Christ
   as a prophet; the scoffers' mouths are shut; the trembling father
   rejoices, and the poor demoniac is cured.

   And yet when Jesus Christ came to cure this poor man, he was in as bad
   a state as he well could be. Nay, the very presence of the Saviour
   seemed to make it worse. As soon as ever the devil perceived that
   Christ was come he began to rend and tear his poor victim. As quaint
   old Fuller says--like a bad tenant whose lease is out, he hates the
   landlord, and so he does all the damage he can, because he has got
   notice to quit. Often just before men are converted, they are worse
   than ever; there is an unusual display of their desperate wickedness,
   for then the devil hath great wrath, now that his time is short.

   The struggles of this child are appalling. The devil seemed as if he
   would kill him before he would be healed; and after great paroxysms of
   the most frightful kind, the poor youth laid upon the ground, pale, and
   still as a corpse, insomuch that many said, "He is dead." It is just
   the same with many conversions of these desperate sinners. Their
   convictions are so terrible; frequently the work of the devil within
   them keeping them from Christ is so furious that you would give up all
   hope. You say, "That man will be driven mad; those acute feelings, the
   intense agony of his spirit will rob him of all mental power, and then
   in abject persecution he will die in his sin." Ah! dear friends, this
   again is only a piece of Satan's infamy. He knew, and knew right well
   that Christ would set that poor young man free, and therefore he sets
   upon him with all his might, to torment him while he may. Have I any
   such desperate case among my hearers this morning--one who has been as
   a son of Belial among the children of men? Is the devil tormenting you
   to-day? Do you feel tempted to commit suicide? Are you urged to some
   freak of yet greater sin in order to drown your griefs and strangle
   your conscience? O poor soul, do no such thing, for my Master will soon
   stoop over you, and take you by the hand and lift you up, and your
   comfort shall begin, because the unclean spirit is cast out. "Ah! he
   means to destroy me," says the soul under conviction. Nay, soul, God
   does not destroy those whom he convinces of sin. Men do not plough
   fields which they have no intention to sow. If God ploughs you with
   conviction he will sow you with gospel comfort, and you shall bring
   forth a harvest of his glory. As a woman at her work first plies the
   needle with its sharp prick, and then draws the thread after it, so in
   your case the sharpness of sorrow for sin will be speedily followed by
   the silver thread of joy and peace in believing.

   And oh, mark it! The vision just now, up there on the mountain of
   glory, resolved itself into "Jesus only." His peerless radiance
   eclipsed every other. So, too, it is "Jesus only," down there in the
   valley. His matchless grace can encounter no rival. Keep this forever
   in your mind's eye--it is the Master who did it all. His appearance on
   the scene removed all difficulties. In such extreme cases, there will
   be, and there must be, a most eminent display of God's power; and that
   power may be unassociated with means. Under any circumstances, it will
   be the Lord alone doing it, to the praise and glory of his grace.

   IV. Now, we come to the last, and perhaps the most important part of
   the sermon. The riddle is perplexing. "WHY COULD NOT WE CAST HIM OUT?"
   Let the Master tell us the reasons why these cases thwart our power.

   The Saviour said it was for want of faith--want of faith. No man may
   expect to be the means of the conversion of a sinner without having
   faith which leads him to believe that the sinner will be converted.
   Such things may occur, but it is not the rule. If I can preach in faith
   that my hearers will be saved, they will be saved. If I have no faith,
   God may honour his Word, but it will be in no great degree; certainly
   he will not honour me. Abandoned sinners, if converted by means, are
   usually brought under the power of divine grace through ministers of
   great faith. Have you observed--there were persons who heard all the
   small fry of the Whitefieldian age; they had listened to this preacher
   and to that. Under whom were they converted? Under Mr. Whitefield,
   because Mr. Whitefield was a man of masterly faith. He believed that
   the lost could be reclaimed--that the worst diseases could be healed,
   the most heinous, abandoned, profligate, blasphemous sinners could be
   saved. He preached to them as if he expected the deaf would be charmed
   by the gospel melody, and the dead would be quickened at the commanding
   call of the great Redeemer's name. At Surrey Chapel, over yonder, in
   Rowland Hill's day, some of the grossest blackguards and biggest scamps
   who ever infested London, were saved. Why? Because Rowland Hill
   preached the gospel to big sinners, and believed the fact of big
   sinners being converted. The respectable people of his day said, "Oh,
   yes! it is only tag, rag, and bob-tail who go to hear Mr. Hill." "Just
   so," said Mr. Hill, " and welcome tag, and welcome rag, and welcome
   bob-tail; they are the very people that I want" "What is the good of
   such people as they are, going to hear the gospel? Why does Mr. Hill
   try to preach to harlots and thieves?" they said. "They are just the
   very people," said Mr. Hill. "I believe that these people can be
   saved." It was want of faith in the others; for if a man have faith as
   a grain of mustard seed, let it be ever so little, yet, if it is true,
   it is mighty in proportion to its power. Mr. Hill had the power of
   faith, and he was the means of the conversion of very great sinners. A
   few years ago it was utterly hopeless to try and reclaim fallen
   daughters of sin, but a few men had faith that it could be done, and it
   has been done; and I will now make bold to say that if there be a great
   sinner here, such as I tried to describe just now, some gross case of
   infernal possession, if that person be not saved, it is for the want of
   faith in our case. If we have brought that person before God, and have
   not been anxious about his salvation, and God has not heard that
   prayer, it is because we could not believe it possible such a case
   could be saved. If God gives you the power to believe that any soul
   will be saved, it will be saved; there is no doubt about that.

   Still, our Saviour added, "Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by
   prayer and fasting." What does he mean by that? I believe he meant that
   in these very special cases ordinary preaching of the Word will not
   avail, and ordinary prayer will not suffice. There must be an unusual
   faith, and to get this there must be an unusual degree of prayer; and
   to get that prayer up to the right point, there must be, in many cases,
   fasting as well. No doubt there is something special about the
   admonition to prayer, from the association in which it stands. One sort
   of Christian will use formal supplications; and the petitions they ask
   are founded upon a sense of propriety, without any glow of feeling.
   Another sort will wait for the Spirit to move them; and when certain
   impulses stimulate their minds, they rejoice in a sense of liberty. Yet
   I show you a more excellent way There be those who watch unto prayer,
   wait before the Lord, seek his face, and exercise patience till they
   get an audience. Such disciples continue in their retirement until they
   have an experience of access for which they crave.

   And what is fasting for? That seems to be the difficult point. It is
   evidently accessory to the peculiar continuance in prayer, practised
   oftentimes by our Lord, and advised by him to his disciples. Not a kind
   of religious observance, in itself meritorious, but a habit, when
   associated with the exercise of prayer, unquestionably helpful. I am
   not sure whether we have lost a very great blessing in the Christian
   Church by giving up fasting. It was said there was superstition in it;
   but, as an old divine says, we had better have a spoonful of
   superstition than a porringer full of gluttony. Martin Luther, whose
   body, like some others, was of a gross tendency, felt as some of us do,
   that in our flesh dwelleth no good thing, in another sense than the
   apostle meant it; and he used to fast frequently. He says his flesh was
   wont to grumble dreadfully at abstinence, but fast he would, for he
   found that when he was fasting, it quickened his praying. There is a
   treatise by an old Puritan, called, "The soul fattening institution of
   fasting," and he gives us his own experience that during a fast he has
   felt more intense eagerness of soul in prayer than he had ever done at
   any other time. Some of you, dear friends, may get to the boiling point
   in prayer, without fasting. I do think that others cannot, and probably
   if we sometimes set apart a whole day for prayer for a special object,
   we should at first feel ourselves dull, and lumpish, and heavy. Then
   let us resolve, "Well, I shall not go down to my dinner. I shall stop
   here. I feel anxious for a praying frame of mind, and I will keep
   alone; and if when the time for evening meal came on, we should say, "I
   feel a little craving of hunger, but I will satisfy them with some very
   slender nutriment--a piece of bread, or something of the kind--and I
   will continue in prayer," I think that very likely towards evening our
   prayers would become more forcible and vehement than at any other part
   of the day. We do not exactly recommend this for those who are weak.
   There are some men with little or no encumbrance of flesh about them;
   but others of us of a heavy make, with sluggishness for a temptation,
   have to cry out because we are rather like stones on the ground than
   birds in the air. To such, I think, we can venture to recommend it from
   the words of Christ. At any rate, I can suppose a father here setting
   apart a day of prayer, going on wrestling with God without any
   intermission; pleading with him till, as it was said of the famous
   martyr of Brussels, he would so pray that he forgot everything except
   his prayer; and when they came to call him to meat, he made no answer,
   for he had got out of all earthly things in his wrestling with the
   angel, that he could not think of anything besides. Such a man taking
   up the case of a gross sinner, I believe, would be the means of that
   sinner's conversion; and the reason why some are never brought to
   Christ, is, speaking after the manner of men, because we have not got
   the qualified to deal with them; for "this kind goeth not out save with
   prayer and fasting." When we have prayed, and have reached the point of
   true faith, then the sinner is saved by the mighty power of God, and
   Christ is glorified. Methinks I have some in this house who are ready
   to say, "Well, if such be the case, I will try it. I will take the
   Master at his word." Brother, brother, if half-a-dozen of us joined
   together, it might be better; nay, "If two agree as touching any one
   thin," it would be done. Let some of us put it to the test upon some
   big sinner, and see whether it does not come true. I think I may fairly
   ask you who are lovers of souls, who have eyes which do weep, and
   hearts which can feel, to try my Master's prescription, and see if the
   most unmanageable devil which ever took possession of a human heart, be
   not driven out, as the result of prayer and fasting, in the exercise of
   your faith. The Lord bless you in this thing, and may he bring us all
   to trust in Jesus by a saving faith. To him be glory, for ever and
   ever. Amen.

                      The Ship on Fire--A Voice of Warning

   A Sermon

   (No. 550)

   Delivered on Sunday Evening, November 8th, 1863, on the

   burning of the Ship "Amazon," by the

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "Escape for thy life."--Genesis 19:17.

   "Thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in
   saving my life."--Genesis 19:19.

   HERE IS THE ALARM of mercy declaring the sinner's duty--"Escape for thy
   life." Here is the work of grace, and the gratitude of the sinner after
   he is saved. "Thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed
   unto me in saving my life."

   The other day, there sailed down the Thames as stout a vessel as had
   ever ploughed the deep. The good ship "Amazon," had sailed the broad
   Pacific many a time, and what is there to hinder her from once more
   reaching America in safety? Who would refuse to underwrite her? Who
   among her crew or passengers has a fear for her safety? But in the book
   of providence, there was a black line against that ship, and never more
   could she reach her desired haven. The wind was exceedingly high: the
   vessel tarried awhile at Gravesend. There was a little improvement in
   the weather: she sailed a little further; but cast anchor again, and
   remained off Broadstairs. Matters went as usual in such weather. Night
   came on; the watch was changed as usual; the captain turned in, feeling
   that all was right and safe. The passengers were snug in their
   berths--a little the worse, perhaps, for the roll of the ship, but as
   assured of security as men could be. In a moment, what a change had
   taken place! A passenger perceives a smell of fire; the warning cry is
   raised. Everyone rushes upon deck. Attempts arc made to quench the
   fire; but when the hatches are lifted up, the wind rushes in, and the
   fire is fanned to a dreadful, all-devouring conflagration. Further
   effort is of no avail. Rockets are fired, as the signals of distress.
   The boats are let down, crowded with the passengers. A lugger puts off
   to her, and a steam-tug hastens to the rescue, and, thanks be unto the
   God of providence, all the passengers--the captain and chief officers
   last--are on board the vessels and carried to Margate, where they see
   the melancholy, and yet satisfactory spectacle of their vessel burning
   to the water's edge, and then disappearing from view.

   Now, as the good brother who was captain to that vessel, constantly
   comes here when he is on shore, and as he is sitting in the midst of
   you to-night, I thought I might use the burning of this vessel as a
   picture of spiritual things, out of which I might make an illustrated
   sermon These things happen not without design, and should not escape
   without improvement.

   Two things, then, to-night: they are both in the text and in the story
   of the ship on fire. First, an alarm--"Escape for thy life;" secondly,
   grateful acknowledgment--"Thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou
   hast shewed unto me in saving my life."

   I. First, AN ALARM.

   We come here to-night, to raise an alarm. True ministers of God. are
   great alarmists. It is their duty to be like Barnabas, who was a son of
   consolation; but it is equally their duty to be like Boanerges--sons of
   thunder. Thunder does not rock men to sleep, and plays no pleasant tune
   for fools to dance to; with its crash and roar, it wakes a slumbering
   world, and its dread volleys, echoed peal on peal, afford no dulcet
   notes for dainty ears. God's servants should learn to thunder; for when
   God speaketh through them, the voice of the Lord is powerful and full
   of majesty; and in his temple doth everyone speak of his glory.

   The alarm we have to give to-night, is that of the angel to Lot, with
   an emphasis of meaning--"Escape for thy life." It is an alarm suggested
   by tremendous danger. When the cry of "Fire! fire! fire!" ran along the
   decks, and the cabins, and the saloons of the "Amazon," everyone knew
   that there was no small danger to be encountered, for flame is a cruel
   tyrant and devours remorselessly. The very word "Fire!" has a
   razor-edge about it, cutting to the very quick. Terror has fire for her
   first-born. But the alarm we have to raise, is concerning a matter more
   terrific still--add to the word "Fire," that dreadful syllable "Hell,"
   and then what shall more alarm than "Hell fire?" In that cry, we
   comprehend such weighty matters as eternity alone can reveal. The wrath
   to come! The judgment of the Eternal! The wrath of the Most High! Fire,
   when it is at its most furious pitch, is but a plaything compared with
   hell fire; yea, when it consumes a city; when it runs down the red lips
   of a volcano, and buries thousands; when it sets the sky and earth upon
   a blaze as in Egypt's plagues, it is but child's-play compared with the
   wrath of God, and that Tophet which is prepared of old, the pile
   whereof is wood and much smoke. Here is something at which the joints
   of a man's loins may well be loosed, for there is eternity in it,
   infinity in it, deity in it; and where these three are set against a
   man,. woe unto him. It is as when the fire is set in battle array
   against the stubble. Well may it be written by the prophet, "The
   sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites.
   Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? Who among us shall
   dwell with everlasting burning?" Sinner, by the crushing terror of the
   woe which cometh, I beseech thee, "Escape for thy life."

   It is a danger not to be overcome. The fire-engine was brought out upon
   the deck of the burning ship; attempts were made to extinguish the
   fire; but the mischief was far too much in power to be driven from its
   stronghold. The like may be boldly declared of the evil which cometh
   upon the ungodly. Sinner, your danger is such that you cannot contend
   with it by any power of your own. There is a fire of sin within you
   which you cannot quench; there is a fire of hell without you which no
   drops even of your own blood shall be able to extinguish. You are in a
   danger which you are unable to cope with. There is no possibility that
   if you remain in it, your utmost exertions or most strenuous efforts
   can avert the certain ruin which your state must bring upon you. If you
   neglect the only way of salvation, how can you escape? What awaits you
   but a fearful looking for of judgment and of fiery indignation? The
   pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at the reproof of the Lord
   of hosts--how, then, canst thou endure the tempest of his anger, and
   the fury of his hot displeasure?

   "O sinner, seek his face,

   Whose wrath thou canst not bear;

   Fly to the dying Savior's wounds,

   And find salvation there."

   It is a danger, too, a terrific danger which makes no exception to
   anyone. The captain is as much in danger as the poorest cabin-boy, if
   he cannot escape from the burning ship. The rich man, with ingots of
   gold in his cabin, will as certainly be burned alive as the poor
   traveler who could scarcely pay his passage. There is no distinction of
   persons in the judgments of God. Sinner, you may be great and mighty,
   but you shall go down to hell unless grace shall save you. Woman, thou
   mayst be amiable in thy temper and excellent in thy deportment, but
   thou shalt perish as surely as a harlot, unless Christ have pity upon
   thee. Man, thou mayst be upright, and shine before thy fellow-merchants
   as one of excellent repute, but the wrath of God abideth on thee except
   thou fleest to Jesus; for there is none other name given under heaven
   whereby ye must be' saved; and out of that name, and apart from that
   name, whoever thou mayst be, though thou wert monarch of seven empires,
   thou art still in danger. Rich and poor, high and low, learned and
   ignorant, my cry is to you all, "O earth, earth, earth, hear the Word
   of the Lord!"

   Do not forget that we are in danger of a consuming fire--a danger which
   kills without remedy. It is not a fire which merely singes and
   scorches, but a fire which burns to ashes. As yonder ship must be
   burned up, and every passenger who cannot leave its burning deck must.
   be consumed, so you, O unconverted men, are in danger of utter
   destruction from the presence of the Lord. "For, behold, the day
   cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all
   that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn
   them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root
   nor branch." I would I could speak upon this dreadful subject in a
   proper manner. Whitfield had tones and emotions which were fitting for
   such a subject. He would cry out, "Oh, the wrath to come! The wrath to
   come! The wrath to come!" He would cry, I say, until all his hearers
   responded. with, "What must we do to be saved?" And good Baxter,
   trembling lest be should he guilty of men's blood, while he delivered
   the message, as a dying man to dying men--knew the terrors of the law,
   and right earnestly he persuaded men to escape for their lives. O sirs,
   if I saw you. in a burning house, there were not half so much need of
   earnestness as when I see you in the midst of a mass of sin and
   corruption which must be consumed by God's anger, and you with it.
   Sinner, why wilt. thou die? What can ail thee? What besots thee that
   thou dost not perceive anything dreadful in the wrath of him who made
   thee? He can dash whole worlds to pieces--what can he not do with thee?
   Hast thou. learned to be callous when thou hearest of eternity? Hast
   thine ear grown cold to that dreadful word, "Condemnation?" Canst thou
   read the story of those to whom he said, "Depart, ye cursed," and not
   tremble? Canst thou know that thou art this day in danger of the
   judgment, and not be afraid? When the sword is sharp, and furbished,
   and taken out of its sheath, canst thou play about its edge? Canst thou
   yet make mirth? Then is there indeed, need for me to cry to thee, and
   for all God's faithful ministers to cry with louder voice than
   mine--"Escape! escape! escape for thy life."

   The alarm of fire was needed because of the security of the persons in
   danger. Many on board the "Amazon" were sound asleep. Oh, how dreadful
   to be awakened out of sleep with the cry of "Fire! fire! fire! Some of
   them, when they awoke, seemed to have been so startled and so confused,
   that they had fairly to be dragged out of their berths that they might
   be rescued. There were none there, we have reason to believe, who would
   have been kept below through their own drunkenness or the carelessness
   of the crew. They were in a right state, with this exception, of
   course, that they were all alarmed--and men alarmed are not always
   ready to do the wisest thing, and as for the captain and his men they
   seem to have been as sensible as they were brave. My hearers, God's
   ministers have to deal with passengers much more difficult to handle.
   Are not men asleep? Till the voice of God awakens us, we are all
   asleep. How you and I walked for years, and years, and years, upon the
   brink of the grave, as utterly unconcerned as though we were to live
   for ever; and when sometimes we were a little impressed by the passing
   bell, or an open grave, or an earnest sermon, how soon we went back
   again to our old frivolity, and toyed with the flames of hell as though
   they were fancy's dream. It is not so now. God has awakened us; but we
   had never been awakened if the voice which awakes the dead had not
   cried in our ear, "Escape for thy life." Nay, worse, men are not only
   asleep, but when they do perceive their danger, they love their sins
   too well to leave them, even though hell stares them in the face. The
   best of them cry with Solomon's sluggard, "Yet a little sleep, a little
   slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep." Sinner, how hard it
   is to bring thee to serious consideration of thy ways. We cannot touch
   thy wits, or make thee reason like a man of sound mind. Thou wilt
   sooner be damned by thoughtlessness thau give an hour's careful
   meditation to thy soul's affairs. We would fain drag thee out of thy
   sleeping berth, and even kick thee and strike thee, treating thee to
   rough usage, if we could by this means drag thee from the devouring
   flames; thou wouldst thank us well enough afterwards for these rough
   cuffs, if we could but wake thee. We hear complaints that the minister
   speaks too harshly and talks too much of judgment. Saved sinners never
   make that complaint. They know that nothing but these terrors will
   awaken some slumbering minds; and if they be awakened themselves, they
   are but too glad, however rough the means may have been. Are there not
   some in this house to-night who are hard, fearfully hard, to be brought
   to sober thinking, because they are drunken and besotted with sin? Some
   of you, with your Sunday trading, will rather gain your sixpences and
   your paltry pence on the Sunday, than find eternal felicity in faith in
   the Lord Jesus. Others of you, with your tap-room companions, with your
   theatres, your balls, and worse places still, where lust wears no mask,
   are cutting the throats of your poor miserable souls. You cannot give
   up your vices; you will sooner be damned than be Christians. Well, so
   it must be, sirs, if ye will have these things, and will pawn your
   souls for them, so it must be; you have chosen your own delusions, and
   you shall inherit them. But O, do listen once more, while we warn you
   in God's name, " Escape for thy life," and trifle no more with hell and
   heaven, with thine own soul and judgment, God and his dear bleeding
   Son. If every preacher in London should suddenly begin to preach
   nothing but alarms, it would all be needed, for what a secure and
   reckless city is this. If every corner in the street had a Jonah in it,
   and that Jonah's sermon were nothing but this--"Yet a few more days and
   thou shalt be destroyed!" it were not too much for a city so given to
   slumber. We have waxen rich; we have grown careless, till we have
   become like Nineveh of old, a people at ease, and dwelling carelessly
   Isaiah might well say concerning London--"Thou saidst, I shall be a
   lady for ever: so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart,
   neither didst remember the latter end of it." Let us take heed unto
   ourselves lest in the world to come this carnal security of ours should
   be like faggots to the fire, and the remembrance of our sloth should
   pour oil upon the flames. O God, let the alarm be heard, to-night by
   those who crowd this house, for thou knowest that many of them are
   sound asleep.

   Again, it is an alarm which requires instant attention. A man on board
   a vessel, when he hears the cry of "Fire!" must not stop to arrange his
   clothes; he must not be concerned to see that his face is washed, that
   he has bound together that little bundle of papers, or packed up the
   portmanteau, or counted over the little purse of gold, or even snatched
   his little property from the cabin. At once, at once, must he climb the
   stairs and reach the deck, or he will never have stairs to climb, nor
   feet to climb with. Now or never. Quick is the word. Waste a moment,
   and it is all over with you; the fire is upon you, for it tarries not
   in its march. So is it with you to-night who fear not God. "Escape for
   thy life," is a cry for the present moment. Now is the accepted time;
   behold, now is the day of salvation." Now, now, NOW. This is the only
   period God has allotted to you, take care that you use it, lest when
   your to-days are past, and you hope to see your to-morrow, you should
   have to spend your to-morrows in the pit of hell. Procrastination is
   not only the thief of time, but the thief of souls. Now is the day of
   salvation; I have never heard of any other day. I do not know, but I
   think this is one of the most difficult things in the gospel ministry,
   a matter worthy of the Holy Ghost's power--to make men seriously think
   about their souls at this present. I know, young man, you intend to
   think of these things when you are ill; you expect to have a long time
   upon a sick-bed, and then you suppose all will be right before you die.
   Who told you you would ever lie upon a sick-bed at all? Yours may be a
   sudden death; and sudden death to such as you, are would be sudden
   damnation. As men stand upon the bank, and spring head-first into the
   water, so may you dash into hell. Death enters men's doors without
   knocking. The judgment may follow on the heels of your next sins. And
   what if you should lie upon a bed of sickness? You will have enough to
   do to bear the pain, to mourn over your weeping wife, and worry
   yourself about those little children who will be left fatherless: I
   tell you, sir, it is hard repenting upon a dying bed. Do not sew
   pillows to thine armholes, and make for thyself this fond hope, that
   thou shalt one day be saved. It is now or never, it is now or never
   with you. I speak as a prophet of God at this moment, I know I do;
   there are some of you to whom this now or never is a more applicable
   thing than you suppose. You will not see a new year. No Christmas
   festivities will be yours. You will be at home on Christmas-day, but it
   will be your long, lost home. "Set thine house in order; for thou shalt
   die, and not live." As the Lord my God liveth, before whom I stand,
   thus saith the Lord unto some of you--"There is but a step between you
   and death." Be warned, then, for as I will meet you on the other side
   the stream, at my Master's judgment-seat, I have bidden you give
   immediate, instantaneous attention to the Word of God. Consider your
   ways, O sinners, born to die. Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, O
   trembler, and thou shalt be saved. Trust him, trust him. God help thee
   to trust Jesus to-night, for it is now or never with thy soul.

   Again, this alarm demands of every one of us who are unsaved, an
   undivided attention. You have fifty things to think about. You tell me
   you have a thousand cares. O sirs, a man whose life is in danger, has
   no other care than to save his life. Did those who were rescued from
   the "Amazon," have time to save their money and their gold? We are told
   that they were utterly destitute when they landed at Margate, and what
   signifies it? Would not a flush of joy be on their cheeks because their
   lives were preserved! If one said to his fellow, "Where is thy purse?"
   "Oh," saith the other, "never mind my purse, I am in the lifeboat; my
   life is saved." What shall it profit you, if you gain the whole world,
   and lose your own soul? And what is the loss after all, if you lose the
   world, if you gain your soul? Nay, those on board the ship had not time
   to save their clothes. The instincts of self-preservation made them
   run, just as they were, half-naked, to the vessel's deck, and so must
   you. I know you will tell me you are not living to make money; if you
   could just make ends meet, keep your family, and supply the wants of
   your children--that is all--are you not to think of this? It is well
   and good; far be it from me to discourage prudent carefulness in all
   matters; it is your business to see to temporal matters, but still your
   paramount business must be your soul; even necessaries must not come
   between your soul and your most serious thoughts. You must see to this
   first and foremost, and remember there is a promise about it--"Seek ye
   first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things
   shall be added unto you." Those persons who escaped from the blazing
   vessel had, some of them, even to suffer in body. We read of one who
   broke his arm in the medley of the escape, but what of that?* (*I hear
   since, from the friends of the second mate, that the man did not break
   his arm.) Better to escape with a broken arm, than fry in those
   horrible flames with every bone in its place. It would be very little
   comfort to the poor passenger to save his bones entire, and to have his
   body consumed. "It is better for thee to enter into life halt or
   maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into
   everlasting fire." You are rightly considerate of your bodies, but
   still, if that poor body, which is to become worm's meat one day, is
   worthy of so much thought, how much more ought you to give to your
   immortal spirit, which is to live for ever with God in glory, or with
   fiends in torment? Think first, I pray you, think chiefly, think now
   to-night with undivided heart, with consecrated thought upon your soul.
   Let comforts go, let pelf go, let raiment go, let life itself go--but
   do see to that which is better than life--thy soul--thine everlasting
   destiny.

   Now, the alarm which I have tried to give--"Escape for thy life!" seems
   to me to suggest a very solemn question. "How can I escape?" says cue.
   Dost thou sincerely ask that question--"What must I do to be saved?"
   Remember there is but one way of rescue--the lifeboat of faith must put
   thee into the vessel of salvation--Christ Jesus. Stop in thine own
   vessel, and thou art burned; leap into those floods of wrath, and thou
   art drowned; get into that boat of saving faith, let that boat bear
   thee into the vessel of Christ Jesus, and thou art safe. Sinner, the
   road of salvation is, out of self into Christ. There are only two steps
   to heaven--out of self, into Christ. That man who has left himself as a
   burning vessel behind, left sin and left self-righteousness as a thing
   to be destroyed--that man who has taken Christ to be his all in all,
   and takes the cross to be the only thing to which he clings, is safe.
   Escape, I pray thee, for thy life, awakened and seeking sinner, for
   Jesus is the only foundation, he only is thy rock and thy salvation;
   come to him for shelter, and you are saved.

   To conclude this matter of alarm, our meditation arouses a very solemn
   enquiry--Will all be safe? Will all in the vessel escape? What joy must
   there have been in the captain's heart when he heard that not one had
   been left to burn in the vessel! Will all escape? Will every hearer in
   this huge house of prayer to-night be a singer in heaven? Dare we, in
   the judgment of charity, hope so? Well, well, let us try to hope, if so
   your charity wishes it, but I fear me, I fear me it will be hope
   without any grounds; for there are some here who love the drunkard's
   cup, others who vomit the swearer's oaths, and some who have the proud,
   self-righteous look which God hateth. O that we could hope that these
   would be transformed by grace through Jesus Christ, that so they might
   be saved! I am, I own it, very much afraid that all of you will not be
   saved, but that some of you will perish in your iniquities. It is not,
   however, our duty to pry into futurity, let us therefore, turn to that
   which far more concerns us, our own personal salvation. The enquiry
   changes--"Shall I be saved? If there be an alarm given, Escape for thy
   life!' Shall I be saved?" And what if it should be the preacher's lot
   to be lost for ever! What, if after talking to you this morning of
   being sick of love to Christ, he should have to hear those doleful
   words, "I never knew you, depart, ye cursed!" And what if this were to
   be the lot of the church-officers who sit around me, or of any one
   amongst you? Brother, you have passed the sacramental cup to others,
   what if the cup of devils be your portion for ever and ever! My
   brethren and sisters in Church fellowship, you may well put the
   question as did the apostles of old, "Lord is it I?"

   "Shall I be banished for my life,

   And yet forbid to die?

   Shall I endure eternal death,

   Yet death for ever fly?"

   Shall it be so! My dear hearer, thou who makest no profession of
   religion, will you ask the question, Shall I, shall I perish in
   devouring flames, or shall I escape? The answer to that question, so
   far as you are concerned, at this moment, must depend upon whether
   there is now a work of grace in your heart. If thou believest that
   Jesus is the Christ, thou canst never perish. If thou dost not, and
   wilt not believe, thy destruction is most sure. O God Almighty, thou
   who alone canst impress the heart, lead everyone of us now to take such
   sure hold of Christ that we may never perish, neither may any pluck us
   out of his hand.

   II. My time is fled, woe is me, when I had meant to have spoken with my
   whole heart upon another topic. It was GRATITUDE. Well, we will just
   run over the points, although most briefly. I will hope that you and I
   are saved; I will trust that we have been put into thy grace-vessel; I
   will believe that we have laid hold on Christ; may me belief be
   warranted by facts? Then this calls for gratitude. Gratitude of what
   kind? Gratitude that I was awakened. O my God, I bless thee that I was
   not permitted to sleep the sleep of death. I thank thee for that fever
   which made me fear, that loss which made me think, that dear dead babe
   which brought the parent to a Savior's feet. I bless thee, Lord, for
   the minister's earnest voice which shook me in my slumbers, for a
   mother's tears which fell like cold drops on my sleeping brow, and made
   me wake. I thank thee, O God, that though others slumber, yet, thou
   hast awakened me, and made me look to my soul's concerns. It is no
   slight mercy to be able to hear the trumpet of warning. It is a
   foundation mercy, but it is not the least of mercies to have an
   awakened conscience.

   Secondly, I would thank God, and let every believer join with me, that
   when you and I were awakened, the ship was not out to sea. If the
   "Amazon" had been far out to sea when the cry of "Fire" was given, what
   must have been the result? How few could have escaped! But there she
   was, close to land. You and I, when we were awakened, were not in
   hell--not like the rich man, lifting up our eyes where hope could never
   come--we were still on praying ground, still on pleading terms with
   God, still off the Foreland, still where mercy could come to us, and
   grace could meet us. Sinner, if you have been awakened to-night, thank
   God for this, thank him that the trumpet which wakes you is not the
   trumpet of the archangel summoning you to judgment, but the silver
   trumpet of God's messenger of mercy, inviting you to mercy banquet.

   Let us thank God it did not blow harder, for there might have been much
   trouble in reaching the boat. When you and I were awakened to a sense
   of sin, it might have been just when death was coming, or when the
   terrors of conscience would have been too much for us, and when the
   fears of death might have kept us from a Savior. But, blessed be God,
   when we were aroused there was wind enough, we were conscience-stricken
   and smitten, but still not too much, or else the fire had been too
   vehement, and we had not escaped. Thank God, then, that he awakened us
   while there was really time to avail ourselves of the covenant
   lifeboat.

   Let us be thankful again, that we could use the signals. I told you
   that the vessel sent up its rockets--signals of distress. Ah! what a
   thousand mercies it was that we could pray. I remember well when this
   was the only comfort my bursting spirit had, I could pray. Oh, to be on
   pleading terms with God! Thank God for this, awakened sinner, bless God
   for this. If you have not got so far as being completely saved, yet do
   praise him that you are allowed to fire off the rockets of desires,
   sighs, groans, sobs, tears, longings, and pantings, and that you can
   send them up where God can see them. Your cries, and groans, and tears
   will yet bring comfort and peace from heaven through the Lamb's
   redeeming blood. Rejoice, my beloved brethren, that the Lord has not
   abolished a mercy-seat, nor forgotten to be gracious. He saith "not to
   the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain." He waits to be gracious. He
   delighteth in mercy. Before you call he will answer, and while you are
   yet speaking he will hear.

   Thank God that there were good officers on board to direct the
   passengers. Without firm authority, men become a mob, and then, with
   every appliance which might save, few are rescued. Awakened sinner, be
   grateful that you have gospel ministers. Oh! what a mercy to have a
   gospel ministry! What an awful thing to sit under a half-and-half
   milk-and-water, yea-and-nay ministry, as was my lot when under
   conviction. I attended different places of worship, but what I heard
   was not the gospel. And I venture to say it, that a few years ago, in
   nine places out of ten in London, and in the suburbs, and throughout
   England, such a thing as the gospel was not preached, except by
   accident. It is preached NOW. It is not preached now as it should be,
   but it is preached now. What I mean by the gospel, is the doctrine that
   Jesus Christ came to save sinners, and that the simple trusting upon
   him is saving faith. This is a doctrine which the revival has brought
   up more clearly, and which the revival keeps before the public mind;
   but before that great movement came, it was a doctrine ignored and cast
   behind; too much of the preaching was a dry morality, or else
   philosophy which might tickle the ears of men who claimed intellect,
   but could never move the heart. Oh, thank God, poor sinner, that you do
   hear it rung in your ears--Come as you are! Come as you are! You hear
   the gospel sung to you:--

   "Just as I am, without one plea,

   But that thy blood was shed for me,

   And that thou bidd'st me come to thee,

   O Lamb of God, I come! I come!

   Just as I aim-thy love I own,

   Has broken every barrier down:

   Now, to be thine, yea, thine alone,

   O Lamb of God, I come! I come!"

   We hold up to you no ceremonies, no feelings, no works, no orthodoxies;
   we only hold up Christ, Christ crucified, a substitute for sinners, a
   substitute for you if you trust him; and we tell you again and again,
   till we half fear of tiring you, that, trusting Jesus, you are saved.
   Now we have reason, if saved, to be grateful to God for gospel
   officers.

   Then how grateful ought you and I to be that the ship is come to the
   rescue. Jesus came all the way from heaven to earth to save us--"Who
   though he was rich, yet for our sakes became poor, that we through his
   poverty might be made rich." How shall we be grateful enough for this
   unspeakable gift?

   "O, for this love let rocks and hills

   Their lasting silence break,

   And all harmonious human tongues

   The Savior's praises speak."

   Better still: how grateful we ought to be that we have got on board
   that ship. Oh! joy! joy! joy! that blessed step which set me upon
   Christ! that blessed act which made me one with him. My soul would
   repeat now that grace-wrought deed of faith.

   "A wounded, weak, and helpless worm,

   On Christ's kind arms I fall;

   Be thou my strength and confidence,

   My Jesus and my all."

   Be grateful for this; and, sinner, if thou canst now step into Christ
   and trust him with thyself, make earth ring with thy joy, and make
   heaven resound with thy praise.

   Our gratitude, methinks, will be greatest of all when we get safe on
   shore, and look on this old hulk, the burning world, without a fear;
   we, will see her blaze and cast her dreadful splendours over the
   infinite leagues of space, until beings in far-off worlds shall ask,
   "What is this? A world on fire, whose elements dissolve with fervent
   heat." But we, caught up together with the Lord, to dwell for ever with
   him, shall look on with complacency, having lost nothing because saved
   in him; having found in him our Savior, better than all we had before,
   and being, once for all on heaven's terra firma, never to put to sea
   again, never to fear tempest, rock, wreck, or fire; but saved! saved!
   saved eternally!

   Escape, sinner, escape for thy life. Remember, though thus I talk to
   thee, if thou shalt escape, free grace must have all the praise; and in
   the language of good Lot, thou wilt have to say--"Thou hast magnified
   thy mercy in saving my life." May God send you away with a blessing,
   for Jesus' sake. Amen.

                                 Faith and Life

   A Sermon

   (No. 551)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, January 24th, 1864, by the

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that
   have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of
   God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; grace and peace be multiplied unto
   you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord, according as
   his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life
   and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to
   glory and virtue: whereby are given unto us exceeding great and
   precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine
   nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through
   lust."--2 Peter 1:1-4.

   THE two most important things in our holy religion are faith and life.
   He who shall rightly understand these two words is not far from being a
   master in experimental theology. Faith and life! these are vital points
   to a Christian. They possess so intimate a connection with each other
   that they are by no means to be severed; God hath so joined them
   together, let no man seek to put them asunder. You shall never find
   true faith unattended by true godliness; on the other hand, you shall
   never discover a truly holy life which has not for its root and
   foundation a living faith upon the righteousness of our Lord Jesus
   Christ. Woe unto those who seek after the one without the other! There
   be some who cultivate faith and forget holiness; these may be very high
   in orthodoxy, but they shall be very deep in damnation, in that day
   when God shall condemn those who hold the truth in unrighteousness, and
   make the doctrine of Christ to pander to their lusts. There are others
   who have strained after holiness of life, but have denied the faith;
   these are comparable unto the Pharisees of old, of whom the Master
   said, they were "whitewashed sepulchres;" they were fair to look upon
   externally, but inwardly, because the living faith was not there, they
   were full of dead men's bones and all manner of uncleanness. Ye must
   have faith, for this is the foundation; ye must have holiness of life,
   for this is the superstructure. Of what avail is the mere foundation of
   a building to a man in the day of tempest? Can he hide himself among
   sunken stones and concrete? He wants a house to cover him, as well as a
   foundation upon which that house might have been built; even so we need
   the superstructure of spiritual life if we would have comfort in the
   day of doubt. But seek not a holy life without faith, for that would be
   to erect a house which can afford no permanent shelter, because it has
   no foundation on a rock--a house which must come down with a tremendous
   crash in the day when the rain descends, and the floods come, and the
   winds blow, and beat upon it. Let faith and life be put together, and,
   like the two abutments of an arch, they shall make your piety strong.
   Like the horses of Pharaoh's chariot, they pull together gloriously.
   Like light and heat streaming from the same sun, they are alike full of
   blessing. Like the two pillars of the temple, they are for glory and
   for beauty. They are two streams from the fountain of grace; two lamps
   lit with holy fire; two olive-trees watered by heavenly care; two stars
   carried in Jesus' hand. The Lord grant that we may have both of these
   to perfection, that his name may be praised.

   Now, it will be clear to all, that in the four verses before us, our
   apostle has most excellently set forth the necessity of these two
   things--twice over he insists upon the faith, and twice over upon
   holiness of life. We will take the first occasion first.

   I. Observe, in the first place, what he says concerning the character
   and the origin of faith, and then concerning the character and origin
   of spiritual life.

   "Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that
   have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of
   God and our Saviour Jesus Christ." So far the faith. "Grace and peace
   be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our
   Lord, according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that
   pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath
   called us to glory and virtue." These two verses, you see, concern the
   spiritual life which comes with the faith.

   Let us begin where Peter begins, with the FAITH. You have here a
   description of true saving faith.

   First, you have a description of its source. He says, "to them that
   have obtained like precious faith." See, then, my brethren, faith does
   not grow in man's heart by nature; it is a thing which is obtained. It
   is not a matter which springs up by a process of education, or by the
   example and excellent instruction of our parents; it is a thing which
   has to be obtained. Not imitation, but regeneration; not development,
   but conversion. All our good things come from without us, only evil can
   be educed from within us. Now, that which is obtained by us must be
   given to us; and well are we taught in Scripture that "faith is not of
   ourselves, it is the gift of God." Although faith is the act of man,
   yet it is the work of God. "With the heart man believeth unto
   righteousness;" but that heart must, first of all, have been renewed by
   divine grace before it ever can be capable of the act of saving faith.
   Faith, we say, is man's act, for we are commanded to "believe on the
   Lord Jesus Christ," and we shall be saved. At the same time, faith is
   God's gift, and wherever we find it, we may know that it did not come
   there from the force of nature, but from a work of divine grace. How
   this magnifies the grace of God, my brethren, and how low this casts
   human nature! Faith. Is it not one of the simplest things? Merely to
   depend upon the blood and righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ, does
   it not seem one of the easiest of virtues? To be nothing, and to let
   him be everything--to be still, and to let him work for me, does not
   this seem to be the most elementary of all the Christian graces?
   Indeed, so it is; and yet, even to this first principle and rudiment,
   poor human nature is so fallen and so utterly undone, that it cannot
   attain unto! Brethren, the Lord must not only open the gates of heaven
   to us at last, but he must open the gates of our heart to faith at the
   first. It is not enough for us to know that he must make us perfect in
   every good work to do his will, but we must be taught that he must even
   give us a desire after Christ; and when this is given, he must enable
   us to give the grip of the hand of faith whereby Jesus Christ becomes
   our Saviour and Lord. Now, the question comes (and we will try and make
   the text of today, a text of examination all the way through) have we
   obtained this faith? Are we conscious that we have been operated upon
   by the Holy Spirit? Is there a vital principle in us which was not
   there originally? Do we know today the folly of carnal confidence? Have
   we a hope that we have been enabled through divine grace to cast away
   all our own righteousness and every dependence, and are we now, whether
   we sink or swim, resting entirely upon the person, the righteousness,
   the blood, the intercession, the precious merit of our Lord Jesus
   Christ? If not, we have cause enough to tremble; but if we have, the
   while the apostle writes, "Unto them that have obtained like precious
   faith," he writes to us, and across the interval of centuries his
   benediction comes as full and fresh as ever, "Grace and peace be
   multiplied unto you."

   Peter having described the origin of this faith, proceeds to describe
   its object. The word "through" in our translation, might, quite as
   correctly, have been rendered "in"--"faith in the righteousness of our
   God and our Saviour Jesus Christ." True faith, then, is a faith in
   Jesus Christ, but it is a faith in Jesus Christ as divine. That man who
   believes in Jesus Christ as simply a prophet, as only a great teacher,
   has not the faith which will save him. Charity would make us hope for
   many Unitarians, but honesty compels us to condemn them without
   exception, so far as vital godliness is concerned. It matters not how
   intelligent may be their conversation, nor how charitable may be their
   manners, nor how patriotic may be their spirit, if they reject Jesus
   Christ as very God of very God, we believe they shall without doubt
   perish everlastingly. Our Lord uttered no dubious words when he said,
   "He that believeth not shall be damned," and we must not attempt to be
   more liberal than the Lord himself. Little allowance can I make for one
   who receives Jesus the prophet, and rejects him as God. It is an
   atrocious outrage upon common sense for a man to profess to be a
   believer in Christ at all, if he does not receive his divinity. I would
   undertake, at any time, to prove to a demonstration, that if Christ
   were not God, he was the grossest impostor who ever lived. One of two
   things, he was either divine or a villain. There is no stopping between
   the two. I cannot imagine a character more evil than that which would
   be borne by a man who should lead his followers to adore him as God,
   without ever putting in a word by way of caveat, to stop their
   idolatry; nay, who should have spoken in terms so ambiguous, that two
   thousand years after his death, there should be found millions of
   persons resting upon him as God. I say, if he were not God, the
   atrocity of his having palmed himself upon us, his disciples, as God,
   puts aside altogether from consideration any of the apparent virtues of
   his life. He was the grossest of all deceivers, if he was not "very God
   of very God." O beloved, you and I have found no difficulties here;
   when we have beheld the record of his miracles, when we have listened
   to the testimony of his divine Father, when we have heard the word of
   the inspired apostles, when we have felt the majesty of his own divine
   influence in our own hearts, we have graciously accepted him as "the
   Wonderful, the Counsellor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father;"
   and, as John bear witness of him and said, "The Word was in the
   beginning with God, and the Word was God," even so have we received
   him; so that at this day, he that was born of the virgin Mary, Jesus of
   Nazareth, the king of the Jews, is to us "God over all, blessed for
   ever."

   "Jesus is worthy to receive

   Honour and power divine:

   And blessings more than we can give,

   Be Lord for ever thine."

   Now, beloved friends, have we heartily and joyfully received Jesus
   Christ as God? My hearer, if thou hast not, I pray thee seek of God the
   faith that saves, for thou hast it not as yet, nor art thou in the way
   to it. Who but a God could bear the weight of sin? Who but a God shall
   be the "same yesterday, to-day, and for ever?" Concerning whom but a
   God could it be said, "I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye sons
   of Jacob are not consumed." We have to do with Christ, and we should be
   consumed if he changed; inasmuch, then, as he does not change, and we
   are not consumed, he must be divine, and our soul rolls the entire
   burden of its care and guilt upon the mighty shoulders of the
   everlasting God, who--

   "Bears the earth's huge pillars up,

   And spreads the heavens abroad."

   Remark in further dwelling upon the text, that the apostle has put in
   another word beside "God", and that is, "of God and our Saviour." As if
   the glory of the Godhead might be too bright for us, he has attempered
   it by gentler words "our Saviour." Now, to trust Jesus Christ as
   divine, will save no man, unless there be added to this a resting in
   him as the great propitiatory sacrifice. Jesus Christ is our Saviour
   because he became a substitute for guilty man. He having taken upon
   himself the form of manhood by union with our nature, stood in the
   room, place, and stead of sinners. When the whole tempest of divine
   wrath was about to spend itself on man, he endured it all for his
   elect; when the great whip of the law must fall, he bared his own
   shoulders to the lash; when the cry was heard, "Awake, O sword!" it was
   against Christ the Shepherd, against the man who was the fellow to the
   eternal God. And because he thus suffered in the place and stead of
   man, he received power from on high to become the Saviour of man, and
   to bring many sons into glory, because he had been made perfect through
   suffering. Now, have we received Jesus Christ as our Saviour? Happy art
   thou, if thou hast laid thy hand upon the head of him who was slain for
   sinners. Be glad, and rejoice in the Lord without ceasing, if today
   that blessed Redeemer who has ascended upon high has become thy
   Saviour, delivered thee from sin, passing by thy transgressions, and
   making thee to be accepted in the beloved. A Saviour is he to us when
   he delivers us from the curse, punishment, guilt and power of sin, "He
   shall save his people from their sins." O thou great God, be thou my
   Saviour, mighty to save.

   But be pleased to notice the word "righteousness." It is a faith in the
   righteousness of our God and our Saviour. In these days, certain
   divines have tried to get rid of all idea of atonement; they have
   taught that faith in Jesus Christ would save men, apart from any faith
   in him as a sacrifice. Ah, brethren, it does not say, "faith in the
   teaching of God our Saviour;" I do not find here that it is written,
   "faith in the character of God our Saviour, as our exemplar." No, but
   "faith in the righteousness of God our Saviour." That righteousness,
   like a white robe, must be cast around us. I have not received Jesus
   Christ at all, but I am an adversary and an enemy to him, unless I have
   received him as Jehovah Tsidkenu, the Lord our righteousness. There is
   his perfect life; that life was a life for me; it contains all the
   virtues, in it there is no spot; it keeps the law of God, and makes it
   honourable; my faith takes that righteousness of Jesus Christ, and it
   is cast about me, and I am then so beauteously, nay, so perfectly
   arrayed, that even the eye of God can see neither spot nor blemish in
   me. Have we, then, today a faith in the righteousness of God our
   Saviour? For no faith but this can ever bring the soul into a condition
   of acceptance before the Most High. Why," saith one, "these are the
   very simplicities of the gospel." Beloved, I know they are, and,
   therefore, do we deal them out this morning, for, thanks be to God, it
   is the simplicities which lie at the foundation; and it is rather by
   simplicities than by mysteries that a Christian is to try himself and
   to see whether he be in the faith or no. Put the question, brethren,
   have we, then, this like precious faith in God and our Saviour Jesus
   Christ?

   Our apostle has not finished the description, without saying that it is
   "like precious faith." All faith is the same sort of faith. Our faith
   may not be like that of Peter, in degree, but if it be genuine, it is
   like it as to its nature, its origin, its objects, and its results.
   Here is a blessed equality. Speak of "liberty, equality, and
   fraternity," you shall only find these things carried out within the
   Church of Christ. There is indeed a blessed equality here, for the
   poorest little-faith who ever crept into heaven on its hands and knees,
   has a like precious faith with the mighty apostle Peter. I say,
   brethren, if the one be gold, so is the other; if the one can move
   mountains, so can the other; for remember, that the privileges of
   mountain-moving, and of plucking up the trees, and casting them into
   the sea, are not given to great faith, but "if ye have faith as a grain
   of mustard seed," it shall be done. Little faith has a royal descent
   and is as truly of divine birth as is the greatest and fullest
   assurance which ever made glad the heart of man, hence it ensures the
   same inheritance at the last, and the same safety by the way. It is
   "like precious faith."

   He tells us too, that faith is "precious;" and is it not precious? for
   it deals with precious things, with precious promises, with precious
   blood, with a precious redemption, with all the preciousness of the
   person of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Well may that be a
   precious faith which supplies our greatest want, delivers us from our
   greatest danger, and admits us to the greatest glory. Well may that be
   called "precious faith," which is the symbol of our election, the
   evidence of our calling, the root of all our graces, the channel of
   communion, the weapon of prevalence, the shield of safety, the
   substance of hope, the evidence of eternity, the guerdon of
   immortality, and the passport of glory. O for more of this inestimably
   precious faith. Precious faith, indeed it is.

   When the apostle, Simon Peter, writes "to them that have obtained like
   precious faith with us, through the righteousness of God, and our
   Saviour Jesus Christ," does he write to you? does he write to me? If
   not, if we are not here addressed, remember that we can never expect to
   hear the voice which says, "Come ye blessed of my Father;" but we are
   today in such a condition, that dying as we now are, "Depart ye cursed"
   must be the thunder which shall roll in our ears, and drive us down to
   hell. So much, then, concerning faith.

   Now we shall turn to notice with great brevity, the LIFE. "Grace and
   peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus
   our Lord, according as his divine power hath given unto us all things
   that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that
   hath called us to glory and virtue." Here we have, then, brethren, the
   fountain and source of our spiritual life. Just as faith is a boon
   which is to be obtained, so you will perceive that our spiritual life
   is a principle which is given. A thing which is given to us, too, by
   divine power--"according as his divine power hath given unto us all
   things that pertain unto life and godliness." To give life at all is
   the essential attribute of God. This is an attribute which he will not
   alienate; to save and to destroy belong unto the Sovereign of heaven.
   "He can create, and he destroy," is one of the profoundest notes in the
   ascription of our praise. Suppose a corpse before us. How great a
   pretender would he be who should boast that it was in his power to
   restore it to life. Certainly, it would be even a greater pretence if
   anyone should say that he could give to himself or to another the
   divine life, the spiritual life by which a man is made a Christian. My
   brethren, you who are partakers of the divine nature, know that by
   nature you were dead in trespasses and sins, and would have continued
   so until this day if there had not been an interposition of divine
   energy on your behalf. There you lay in the grave of your sin, rotten,
   corrupt. The voice of the minister called to you, but you did not hear.
   You were often bidden to come forth, but ye did not and could not come.
   But when the Lord said, "Lazarus, come forth," then Lazarus came forth;
   and when he said to you, "Live," then you lived also, and the spiritual
   life beat within you, with joy and peace through believing. This we
   ought never to forget, because, let us never fail to remember, that if
   our religion is a thing which sprang from ourselves, it is of the
   flesh, and must die. That which is born of the flesh in its best and
   most favourable moments, is flesh, and only that which is born of the
   Spirit is spirit. "Ye must be born again." If a man's religious life be
   only a refinement of his ordinary life, if it be only a high attainment
   of the natural existence, then is it not the spiritual life, and does
   not prepare him for the eternal life before the throne of God. No, we
   must have a supernatural spark of heavenly flame kindled within us.
   Just as nothing but the soul can quicken the body and make it live, so
   the Spirit alone can quicken the soul and make the soul live. We must
   have the third master-principle infused, or else we shall be but
   natural men, made after the image of the first Adam. We must have, I
   say, the new spirit, or else we shall not be like the second Adam, who
   was made a quickening spirit. Only of the Christian can we say that he
   is spirit, soul, and body; the ungodly man has only soul and body, and
   as to spiritual existence, he is as dead as the body would be if there
   were no soul. Now the implantation of this new principle, called the
   spirit, is a work of divine power. Divine power! What stupendous issues
   are grasped in that term, divine power! It was this which digged the
   deep foundations of the earth and sea! Divine power, it is this which
   guides the marches of the stars of heaven! Divine power! it is this
   which holds up the pillars of the universe, and which one day shall
   shake them, and hurry all things back to their native nothingness. Yet
   the selfsame power which is required to create a world and to sustain
   it, is required to make man a Christian, and unless that power be put
   forth, the spiritual life is not in any one of us.

   You will perceive, dear friends, that the apostle Peter wished to see
   this divine life in a healthy and vigorous state, and therefore he
   prays that grace and peace may be multiplied. Divine power is the
   foundation of this life; grace is the food it feeds upon, and peace is
   the element in which it lives most healthily. Give a Christian much
   grace, and his spiritual life will be like the life of a man who is
   well clothed and nurtured; keep the spiritual life without abundant
   grace, and it becomes lean, faint, and ready to die; and though die it
   cannot, yet will it seem as though it gave up the ghost, unless fresh
   grace be bestowed. Peace, I say, is the element in which it flourishes
   most. Let a Christian be much disturbed in mind, let earthly cares get
   into his soul, let him have doubts and fears as to his eternal safety,
   let him lose a sense of reconciliation to God, let his adoption be but
   dimly before his eyes, and you will not see much of the divine life
   within him. But oh! if God shall smile upon the life within you, and
   you get much grace from God, and your soul dwells much in the balmy air
   of heavenly peace, then shall you be strong to exercise yourself unto
   godliness, and your whole life shall adorn the doctrine of God your
   Saviour.

   Observe, again, that in describing this life, he speaks of it as one
   which was conferred upon us by our being called. He says, "We were
   called unto glory and virtue." I find translators differ here. Many of
   them think the word should be "By"--"We are called by the glory and
   virtue of God"--that is, there is a manifestation of all the glorious
   attributes of God, and of all the efficacious virtue and energy of his
   power in the calling of every Christian. Simon Peter himself was at his
   fishing and in his boat, but Jesus said to him, "Follow me;" and at
   once he followed Christ. He says there was in that calling, the divine
   glory and virtue; and, doubtless, when you and I shall get to heaven,
   and see things as they are, we shall discover in our effectual calling
   of God to grace, a glory as great as in the creation of worlds, and a
   virtue as great as in the healing of the sick, when virtue went from
   the garments of a Saviour. Now, can we say today, that we have a life
   within us which is the result of divine power, and have we, upon
   searching ourselves, reason to believe, dear friends, that there is
   that within us which distinguishes us from other men, because we have
   been called out by mankind by the glory and energy of the divine power?
   I am afraid some of us must say "Nay." Then the Lord in his mercy yet
   bring us into the number of his people. But if we can, however,
   tremblingly say, "Yes, I trust there is something of the life in me;"
   then as Peter did so, do I wish for you that benediction, "Grace and
   peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of our Lord and
   Saviour Jesus Christ." O brethren, whatever men may say against the
   faith of God, there is nothing in the world which creates virtue like
   true faith. Wherever true faith enters, though it be into the heart of
   a harlot or of a thief, what a change it makes! See her there; she has
   polluted herself many times; she has gone far into sin. Mary has been a
   sinner; she hears the preaching of the Saviour; standing in the crowd
   she listens to him one day as he preaches concerning the prodigal, and
   how the loving father pressed him to his bosom; she comes to Jesus and
   she finds forgiveness. Is she a harlot any longer? Nay, there she is,
   washing his feet with her tears, and wiping them with the hairs of her
   head. The woman who was a sinner, hates her evil ways and loves her
   gracious Lord. We may say of her, "But she is washed, but she is
   sanctified, but she is saved." Take Saul of Tarsus. Foaming with blood,
   breathing out threatenings, he is going to Damascus to drag the saints
   of God to prison. On the road he is struck down; by divine mercy he is
   led to put his trust in Jesus. Is he a persecutor any longer? See that
   earnest apostle beaten with rods--shipwrecked--in labours more abundant
   than all the rest of them--counting not his life dear unto him, that he
   may win Christ and be found in him. Saul of Tarsus becomes a majestic
   proof of what the grace of God can do. See Zaccheus, the grasping
   publican, distributing his wealth, the Ephesians burning their magical
   books, the jailer washing the apostle's stripes. Take the case of many
   now present. Let memory refresh itself this morning, with the
   recollection of the change which has been wrought in you. We have
   nothing to boast of; God forbid that we should glory, save in the cross
   of Christ, but yet some of us are wonderful instances of renewing
   grace. We were unclean, our mouths could utter blasphemy; our temper
   was hot and terrible; our hands were unrighteous; we were altogether as
   an unclean thing, but how changed now! Again, I say, we boast of
   nothing which we now are, for by the grace of God we are what we are,
   yet the change is something to be wondered at. Has divine grace wrought
   this change in you? Be not weary with my reiteration of this question.
   Let me put it again to you till I get an answer; nay, till I force you
   to an answer: Have you this precious faith? Can you not answer the
   question? Then, have you not that divine life, that life which is given
   by divine calling? If you have the one, you have the other; and if you
   have not both, you have neither; for where there is the one, the other
   must come, and where the one has come, the other has been there.

   II. I have thus fully but feebly brought the subject before you, allow
   me to remind you that another verse remains which handles the same
   topics. In the fourth verse, he deals with the privileges of faith, and
   also with the privileges of the spiritual life.

   Notice the PRIVILEGE OF FAITH first. "Whereby are given unto us
   exceeding great and precious promises"--here is the faith, "That by
   these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the
   corruption that is in the world through lust." Here is the life
   resulting from the faith. Now, the privileges of faith first. The
   privileges of faith are, that we have given to us "Exceeding great and
   precious promises." "Great and precious"--two words which do not often
   come together. Many things are great which are not precious, such as
   great rocks, which are of little value; on the other hand, many things
   are precious which are not great--such as diamonds and other jewels,
   which cannot be very great if they be very precious. But here we have
   promises which are so great, that they are not less than infinite, and
   so precious, that they are not less than divine. I shall not attempt to
   speak about their greatness or their preciousness, but just give a
   catalogue of them, and leave you to guess at both. We have some of them
   which are like birds in the hands--we have them already; other promises
   are like birds in the bush, only that they are just as valuable and as
   sure as those which are in the hand.

   Note here, then, we have received by precious faith the promise and
   pardon. Hark thee, my soul, all thy sins are forgiven thee. He who hath
   faith in Christ hath no sin to curse him, his sins are washed away,
   they have ceased to be; they have been carried on the scape-goat's head
   into the wilderness; they are drowned in the Red Sea; they are blotted
   out; they are thrown behind God's back; they are cast into the depths
   of the sea. Here is a promise of perfect pardon. Is not this great and
   precious?--as great as your sins are; and if your sins demanded a
   costly ransom, this precious promise is as great as the demand.

   Then comes the righteousness of Christ: you are not only pardoned, that
   is, washed and made clean, but you are dressed, robed in garments such
   as no man could ever weave. The vesture is divine. Jehovah himself has
   wrought out your righteousness for you; the holy life of Jesus the Son
   of God, has become your beauteous dress, and you are covered with it.
   Christian, is not this an exceeding great and precious promise? The law
   was great--this righteousness is as great as the law. The law asked a
   precious revenue from man, more than humanity could pay--the
   righteousness of Christ has paid it all. Is it not great and precious?

   Then next comes reconciliation. You were strangers, but you are brought
   nigh by the blood of Christ. Once aliens, but now fellow-citizens with
   the saints and of the household of God. Is not this great and precious?

   Then comes your adoption. "Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it
   doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall
   appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is." "And if
   children, then heirs, heirs of God, joint heirs with Jesus Christ, if
   so be we suffer with him that we may be glorified together." Oh, how
   glorious is this great and precious promise of adoption!

   Then we have the promise of providence: "all things work together for
   good to them that love God, to them that are called according to his
   purpose." "Thy place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks." "Thy
   bread shall be given thee and thy waters shall be sure." "As thy days
   thy strength shall be." "Fear not, I am with thee; be not dismayed, I
   am thy God." "When thou passest through the rivers, I will be with
   thee, the floods shall not overflow thee. When thou goest through the
   fire, thou shalt not be burned, neither shall the flames kindle upon
   thee." When I think of providence, the greatness of its daily gifts,
   and the preciousness of its hourly boons, I may well say, here is an
   exceeding great and precious promise.

   Then you have the promise too, that you shall never taste of death but
   shall only sleep in Jesus. "Write, blessed are the dead which die in
   the Lord from henceforth. Yea, saith the Spirit, that they cease from
   their labours; and their works do follow them." Nor does the promise
   cease here, you have the promise of a resurrection. "For the trumpet
   shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall
   be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this
   mortal must put on immortality." Beloved, we know that if Christ rose
   from the dead, so also them who sleep in Jesus, will the Lord bring
   with him. Nor is this all, for we shall reign with Jesus; at his
   coming, we shall be glorified with him, we shall sit upon his throne,
   even as he has overcome and sits with his Father upon his throne. The
   harps of heaven, the streets of glory, the trees of paradise, the river
   of the water of life, the eternity of immaculate bliss--all these, God
   hath promised to them who love him. "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,
   the things which God hath prepared for them that love him, but he hath
   revealed them unto us by his Spirit;" and by our faith we have grasped
   them, and we have today "the substance of things hoped for, and the
   evidence of things not seen." Now, beloved, see how rich faith makes
   you!--what treasure!--what a costly regalia!--what gold mines!--what
   oceans of wealth!--what mountains of sparkling treasures has God
   conferred upon you by faith!

   But we must not forget the life, and with that we close. The text says,
   he has given us this promise, "that"--"in order that." What then? What
   are all these treasures lavished for? For what these pearls? For what
   these jewels? For what, I say, these oceans of treasure? For what? Is
   the end worthy of the means? Surely God never giveth greater store than
   the thing which he would purchase will be worth. We may suppose, then,
   the end to be very great when such costly means have been given; and
   what is the end? Why, "that by these ye might be partakers of the
   divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world
   through lust." O, my brethren, if you have these mercies today by
   faith, do see to it that the result is obtained. Be not content to be
   made rich in these great and precious promises, without answering God's
   design in your being thus enriched. That design, you perceive, is
   twofold; it is first that you may be partakers of the divine nature;
   and, secondly, that you may escape the corruption which is in the
   world.

   To be a partaker of the divine nature is not, of course, to become God.
   That cannot be. The essence of Deity is not to be participated in by
   the creature. Between the creature and the Creator there must ever be a
   gulf fixed in respect of essence; but as the first man Adam was made in
   the image of God, so we, by the renewal of the Holy Spirit, are in a
   yet diviner sense made in the image of the Most High, and are partakers
   of the divine nature. We are, by grace, made like God. "God is love;"
   we become love--"He that loveth is born of God." God is truth; we
   become true, and we love that which is true, and we hate the darkness
   and the lie. God is good, it is his very name; he makes us good by his
   grace, so that we become the pure in heart who shall see God. Nay, I
   will say this, that we become partakers of the divine nature in even a
   higher sense than this--in fact, in any sense, anything short of our
   being absolutely divine. Do we not become members of the body of the
   divine person of Christ? And what sort of union is this--"members of
   his body, of his flesh, and of his bones?" The same blood which flows
   in the head flows in the hand, and the same life which quickens Christ,
   quickens his people; for, "Ye are dead, and your life is hid with
   Christ in God." Nay, as if this were not enough, we are married into
   Christ. He hath betrothed us unto himself in righteousness and in
   faithfulness; and as the spouse must, in the nature of things, be a
   partaker of the same nature as the husband, so Jesus Christ first
   became partaker of flesh and blood that they twain might be one flesh;
   and then he makes his Church partakers of the same spirit, that they
   twain may be one spirit; for he who is joined unto the Lord is one
   spirit. Oh, marvellous mystery! we look into it, but who shall
   understand it? One with Jesus, by eternal union one, married to him; so
   one with him that the branch is not more one with the vine than we are
   a part of the Lord, our Saviour, and our Redeemer. Rejoice in this,
   brethren, ye are made partakers of the divine nature, and all these
   promises are given to you in order that you may show this forth among
   the sons of men, that ye are like God, and not like ordinary men; that
   ye are different now from what flesh and blood would make you, having
   been made participators of the nature of God.

   Then the other result which follows from it, was this, "Having escaped
   the corruption that is in the world through lust." Ah, beloved, it were
   ill that a man who is alive should dwell in corruption. "Why seek ye
   the living among the dead?" said the angel to Magdalene. Should the
   living dwell among the dead? Should divine life be found amongst the
   corruptions of worldly lusts? The bride of Christ drunken! Frequenting
   the ale-house! A member of Christ's body found intoxicated in the
   streets, or lying, or blaspheming, or dishonest! God forbid. Shall I
   take the members of Christ, and make them members of a harlot? How can
   I drink the cup of the Lord, and drink the cup of Belial? How can it be
   possible that I can have life, and yet dwell in the black, dark, foul,
   filthy, pestiferous tomb of the world's lusts? Surely, brethren, from
   these open lusts and sins ye have escaped: have ye also escaped from
   slothfulness? Have ye clean escaped from carnal security? Are we
   seeking day by day to live above worldliness, and love of the things of
   the world, and the ensnaring avarice which they nourish? Remember, it
   is for this that you have been enriched with the treasures of God. Do
   not, oh, I conjure you, do not, chosen of God and beloved by him, and
   so graciously enriched, do not suffer all this lavish treasure to be
   wasted upon you.

   There is nothing which my heart desires more than to see you, the
   members of this Church, distinguished for holiness: it is the
   Christian's crown and glory. An unholy Church! it is of no use to the
   world, and of no esteem among men. Oh! it is an abomination, hell's
   laughter, heaven's abhorrence. And the larger the Church, the more
   influential, the worse nuisance does it become, when it becomes dead
   and unholy. The worst evils which have ever come upon the world, have
   been brought upon her by an unholy Church. Whence came the darkness of
   the dark ages? From the Church of Rome. And if we want to see the world
   again sitting in Egyptian darkness, bound with fetters of iron, we have
   only to give up the faith, and to renounce holiness of life, and we may
   drag the world down again to the limbo of superstition, and bind her
   fast in chains of ignorance and vice. O Christian, the vows of God are
   upon you. You are God's priest: act as such. You are God's king: reign
   over your lusts. You are God's chosen: do not associate with Belial.
   Heaven is your portion; live like a heavenly spirit, so shall you prove
   that you have the true faith; but except ye do this, your end shall be
   to lift up your eyes in hell, and find yourself mistaken when it will
   be too late to seek or find a remedy. The Lord give us the faith and
   the life, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

                                Do You Know Him?

   A Sermon

   (No. 552)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, January 31st, 1864, by the

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "That I may know him."--Philippians 3:10.

   THE object of the apostle's life--that for which he sacrificed
   everything: country, kindred, honor, comfort, liberty, and life itself,
   was, that he might know Christ. Observe that this is not Paul's prayer
   as an unconverted man, that he may know Christ, and so be saved; for it
   follows upon the previous supplication that he might win Christ and be
   found in him. This is the desire of one who has been saved, who enjoys
   the full conviction that his sins are pardoned, and that he is in
   Christ. It is only the regenerated and saved man who can feel the
   desire, "That I may know him." Are you astonished that a saved man
   should have such a desire as this? A moment's reflection will remove
   your astonishment. Imagine for a moment that you are living in the age
   of the Roman emperors. You have been captured by Roman soldiers and
   dragged from your native country; you have been sold for a slave,
   stripped, whipped, branded, imprisoned, and treated with shameful
   cruelty. At last yon are appointed to die in the amphitheatre, to make
   holiday for a tyrant. The populace assemble with delight. There they
   are, tens of thousands of them, gazing down from the living sides of
   the capacious Colosseum. You stand alone, and naked, armed only with a
   single dagger--a poor defense against gigantic beasts. A ponderous door
   is drawn up by machinery, and forth there rushes the monarch of the
   forest--a huge lion; you must slay him or be torn to pieces. You are
   absolutely certain that the conflict is too stern for you, and that the
   sure result must and will be that those terrible teeth will grind your
   bones and drip with your blood. You tremble; your joints are loosed;
   you are paralyzed with fear, like the timid deer when the lion has
   dashed it to the ground. But what is this? O wonder of mercy!--a
   deliverer appears. A great unknown leaps from among the gazing
   multitude, and confronts the savage monster. He quails not at the
   roaring of the devourer, but dashes upon him with terrible fury, till,
   like a whipped cur, the lion slinks towards his den, dragging himself
   along in pain and fear. The hero lifts you up, smiles into your
   bloodless face, whispers comfort in your ear, and bids you be of good
   courage, for you are free. Do you not think that there would arise at
   once in your heart a desire to know your deliverer? As the guards
   conducted you into the open street, and you breathed the cool, fresh
   air, would not the first question be, "Who was my deliverer, that I may
   fall at his feet and bless him?" You are not, however, informed, but
   instead of it you are gently led away to a noble mansion house, where
   your many wounds are washed and healed with salve of rarest power. You
   are clothed in sumptuous apparel; you are made to sit down at a feast;
   you eat and are satisfied; you rest upon the softest down. The next
   morning you are attended by servants who guard you from evil and
   minister to your good. Day after day, week after week, your wants are
   supplied. You live like a courtier. There is nothing that you can ask
   which you do not receive. I am sure that your curiosity would grow more
   and more intense till it would ripen into an insatiable craving. You
   would scarcely neglect an opportunity of asking the servants, "Tell me,
   who does all this, who is my noble benefactor, for I must know him?"
   "Well, but" they would say, "is it not enough for you that you are
   delivered from the lion?" "Nay," say you, "it is for that very reason
   that I pant to know him." "Your wants are richly supplied--why are yon
   vexed by curiosity as to the hand which reaches you the boon? If your
   garment is worn out, there is another. Long before hunger oppresses
   you, the table is well loaded. What more do you want?" But your reply
   is, "It is because I have no wants, that, therefore, my soul longs and
   yearns even to hungering and to thirsting, that I may know my generous
   loving friend." Suppose that as you wake up one morning, you find lying
   up on your pillow a precious love-token from your unknown friend, a
   ring sparkling with jewels and engraved with a tender inscription, a
   bouquet of flowers bound about with a love-motto! Your curiosity now
   knows no bounds. But you are informed that this wondrous being has not
   only done for you what you have seen, but a thousand deeds of love
   which you did not see, which were higher and greater still as proofs of
   his affection. You are told that he was wounded, and imprisoned, and
   scourged for your sake, for he had a love to yon so great, that death
   itself could not overcome it: you are informed that he is every moment
   occupied in your interests, because he has sworn by himself that where
   he is there you shall be; his honors you shall share, and of his
   happiness you shall be the crown. Why, methinks you would say, "Tell
   me, men and women, any of you who know him, tell me who he is and what
   he is;" and if they said, "But it is enough for you to know that he
   loves you, and to have daily proofs of his goodness," you would say,
   "No, these love-tokens increase my thirst. If ye see him, tell him I am
   sick of love. The flagons which he sends me, and the love-tokens which
   he gives me, they stay me for awhile with the assurance of his
   affection but they only impel me onward with the more unconquerable
   desire that I may know him. I must know him; I cannot live without
   knowing him. His goodness makes me thirst, and pant, and faint, and
   even die, that I may know him."

   Have I imagined emotions which would not be natural? I think not. The
   most cool and calculating would be warmed with desires like these.
   Methinks what I have now pictured before you will wake the echoes in
   your breasts, and you will say, "Ah, it is even so! It is because
   Christ loved me and gave himself for me that I want to know him; it is
   because he has shed his blood for me and has chosen me that I may be
   one with him for ever, that my soul desires a fuller acquaintance with
   him."

   Now may God, the Holy Ghost, very graciously lead me onward that I may
   also quicken in you the desire to know HIM.

   I. Beloved, let us PASS BY THAT CROWD OF OUTER-COURT WORSHIPPERS WHO
   ARE CONTENT TO LIVE WITHOUT KNOWING CHRIST. I do not mean the ungodly
   and profane; we will not consider them just now--they arc altogether
   strangers and foreigners to him--I mean children of God: the visible
   saints. How many there are of these whom I must call outer-court
   worshippers, for they are strangers to this panting to know him. They
   can say with Paul, "That I may win him and be found in him"--that they
   do want; but this higher wish, "That I may know him," has not stirred
   their hearts. How many brethren we know, who are content to know
   Christ's historic life! They read the evangelists and they are charmed
   with the perfect beauty of the Savior's history. "Never man spake like
   this man," say they; and they confess that never man acted with such
   love as lie did. They know all the incidents of his life, from his
   manger to his cross; but they do not know HIM. They are as men who have
   read " Caesar's Commentaries," but who have never seen Caesar. They
   know the battles which Caesar fought; they can even recognize the
   mantle which Caesar wore "that day he overcame the Nervii;" but they do
   not know Caesar himself. The person of the Lord Jesus is us much hidden
   from their eyes us the golden pot of manna when concealed in the ark.
   They know the life of Christ, hut not Christ the Life; they admire his
   way among men, hut they see not himself as the way.

   Others there are who know Christ's doctrine, and prize it too, but they
   know not Him. All which he taught is dear to them; orthodoxy--for this
   they would burn at Smithfield, or lay down their necks at Tower Hill.
   Many of them are well-instructed and divinely-illuminated in the
   doctrine of Christ, and the wonder is, that they should stop there;
   because, beloved, it does seem to me when I begin to know a man's
   teaching, that the next thing is the desire to know his person.
   Addison, in one of the " Spectators," tells us that the reason why so
   many books are printed with the portraits of the authors is just this,
   that as a man reads a book, lie feels a desire to know what sort of
   appearance the author had. This, indeed, is very natural. If you have
   ever been refreshed under a minister's printed sermons, if you have at
   any time received any benefit from his words, I know you have said, "I
   would like to see that man; I would like to hear the truth flow hot and
   fresh from his living lips; I would like to know just how he said that
   sentence, and how that passage sounded as it came from his earnest
   heart." My beloved, surely if you know the doctrine of Jesus, if you
   have so been with Christ as to sit at his feet and hear what he has to
   say, you must, I hope, have had some longings to know him--to know his
   person; and if you have, you will have had to pass by multitudes of
   followers of Jesus who rest satisfied with his words, but forget that
   he is himself "THE WORD."

   Beloved, there are others--and against them I bring no complaint; they
   go as far as they can--who are delighted with Christ's example.
   Christ's character is in their esteem the mirror of all perfection.
   They desire to walk in his footsteps; they listen to his sermon upon
   the Mount; they are enchanted with it--as well they may be; they pray
   to he obedient in all things to Christ, as their Master and their Lord.
   They do well. Mark, I am finding no fault with any of these who prize
   the history, or who value the doctrine, or who admire the precept; but
   I want more. I do want, beloved, that you and I should "know HIM." I
   love his precepts, but I love HIM better. Sweet is the water from
   Bethlehem's well; and well worth the struggle of the armed men to win
   but a bucket from it; but the well itself is better, and deserves all
   Israel's valor to defend it. As the source is ever more valuable than
   the stream, so is Christ ever better than the best words of his lips,
   or the best deeds of his hand. I want to know him. I do care for his
   actions; my soul would sit down and admire those masterly works of holy
   art--his miracles of humiliation, of suffering, of patience, and of
   holy charity; but better far I love the hands which wrought these
   master-works, the lips which spoke these goodly words, and the heart
   which heaved with that matchless love which was the cause of all. Yes,
   beloved, we must get farther than Immanuel's achievements, however
   glorious; we must come to "know him."

   Most believers rest perfectly at ease with knowing Christ's sacrifice.
   They see Jesus as the great High Priest, laying a great sacrifice upon
   the altar for their sins, and with their whole heart they accept his
   atonement. By faith they know that all their sin is taken away by
   precious blood. This is a most blessed and hallowed attainment, I will
   grant you; but it is not every Christian who perceives that Christ was
   not only the offerer of a sacrifice, but was himself the sacrifice,
   and, therefore, loves him as such. Priest, altar, victim, everything
   Christ was. He gathers up all in himself, and when I see that he loved
   me, and gave himself for me, it is not enough to know this fact: I want
   to know him, the glorious person who does and is all this. I want to
   know the man who thus gave himself for me. I want to behold the Lamb
   once slain for me. I want to rest upon the bosom which covers the heart
   which was pierced with the spear; I pray him to kiss me with the kisses
   of that mouth which cried, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" I love
   Calvary, the scene of woe, but I love Christ better, the great object
   of that agony; and even his cross and all his sufferings, dear though
   these must ever be to the Christian mind, only occupying a second
   place; the first seat is for himself, his person, his deity, and
   humanity.

   Thus, you see, we have to leave a great many believers behind; nor have
   we enumerated all, for I believe that even some of those saints who
   have received grace to look for the coming of Christ, yet in their
   vision of his coming too much forget him. Is it not possible for nine
   to pant for the second advent as to lose sight of him who is to make
   that advent? So to long for a millennium, that I may forget him who is
   to reign King of kings? So to pant after that glory of Israel that I
   may forget him who is Israel's glory? Anywhere short of knowing him, I
   would not have you stop, beloved; and even when you know him, I would
   urge you still to be impelled with the same desire, and to press
   forward, crying with the apostle, "That I may know him."

   Beloved, how many there are who have heard of Christ and read about
   Christ, and that is enough for them! But it is not enough for me, and
   it should not be enough for you. The apostle Paul did not say "I have
   heard of him, on whom I have believed," but " I know whom I have
   believed." To hear about Christ may damn you, it may be a savor of
   death unto death to you. You have heard of him with the ear; hut it is
   essential that you know him in order that you may be partakers of
   eternal life. My dear hearers, be not content unless you have this as
   your soul's present portion.

   Others there be who have been persuaded by the judgment and
   encouragement of others, that they know something about the great
   Redeemer. They do not know him, but still they are persuaded by others
   that they have an interest in him. Let me warn you of second-hand
   spirituality, it is a rotten, soul-deceiving deception. Beware of all
   esteeming yourself according to the thoughts of others, or you will be
   ruined. Another man's opinion of me may have great influence over me, I
   have heard of a man in perfectly good health killed by the opinion of
   others. Several of his friends had foolishly agreed to play him a
   practical trick; whereupon one of them met him and said, "How ill you
   look this morning." He did not feel so; he was very much surprised at
   the remark. When he met the next, who said to him, "Oh! dear, how bad
   you look," lie began to think there might be something in it; and us he
   turned smart round the corner, a third person said to him, "What a
   sight you are! How altered from what you used to be!" He went home ill,
   he took to his bed and died. So goes the story, and I should not marvel
   if it really did occur. Now, if such might be the effect of persuasion
   and supposed belief in the sickness of a man, how much more readily may
   men be persuaded into the idea of spiritual health! A believer meets
   you, and by his treatment seems to say, " I welcome you as a dear
   brother"--and means it too. You are baptized, and you are received into
   Church-fellowship, and so everybody thinks that von must be a follower
   of Christ; and yet you may not know him. Oh, I do pray you, do not be
   satisfied with being persuaded into something like an assurance that
   you are in him, but do know him--know him for yourself.

   There are many who I hope will be saved ere long; but I am in great
   doubt of them, because they can only say they half think they know
   Christ; they do not quite believe in him, but they do not disbelieve in
   him; they halt between two opinions. Ah, dear hearer, that is a very
   dangerous place to stand in. The border-land is the devil's hunting
   ground. Undecided souls are fair game for the great fowler. God give
   you once for all the true decision by which through grace you shall
   know him. Do not be satisfied with thinking you know him; hoping you
   know him, but know him. Oh, it is nothing to have heard about him, to
   have talked about him, to have eaten and have drank with him, to have
   preached him, or even to have wrought miracles in his name, to have
   been charmed by his eloquence, to have been stirred with the story of
   his love, to have been moved to imitate him--this shall nothing avail
   you, unless you win him and are found in him. Seek with the apostle, to
   give up everything of your own righteousness, and all other objects and
   aims in life, and say, "This I seek after, that I may know him." Thus
   much, then, on the first point. Leaving those behind who do not know
   him, let us make an advance.

   II. Secondly, let us DRAW CURTAIN AFTER CURTAIN WHICH SHALL ADMIT US TO
   KNOW MORE OF CHRIST.

   Did you ever visit the manufactory of splendid porcelain at Sevres? I
   have done so. If anybody should say to me, "Do you know the manufactory
   at Sevres?" I should say, " Yes, I do, and no, I do not. I know it, for
   I have seen the building; I have seen the rooms in which the articles
   are exhibited for sale, and I have seen the museum and model room; but
   I do not know the factory as I would like to know it, for I have not
   seen the process of manufacture, and have not been admitted into the
   workshops, as some are. "Suppose I had seen, however, the process of
   the moulding of the clay, and the laying on of the rich designs, if
   anybody should still say to me, "Do you know how they manufacture those
   wonderful articles?" I should very likely still be compelled to say,
   "No, I do not, because there are certain secrets, certain private rooms
   into which neither friend nor foe can be admitted, lest the process
   should be open to the world." So, you see, I might say I knew, and yet
   might not half know; and when I half knew, still there would be so much
   left, that I might be compelled to say, "I do not know." How many
   different ways there are of knowing a person--and even so there are all
   these different ways of knowing Christ; so that you may keep on all
   your lifetime, still wishing to get into another room, and another
   room, nearer and nearer to the great secret, still panting to "know
   him." Good Rutherford says, "I urge upon you a nearer communion with
   Christ, and a growing communion. There are curtains to be drawn by, in
   Christ, that we never shut, and new foldings in love with him. I
   despair that ever I shall shall win to the far end of that love; there
   are so many plies in it. Therefore, dig deep, and set by as much time
   in the day for him as you can, he will be won by labor."

   To begin with. We know a person when we recognize him. You know the
   Queen. Well, I do. I recollect seeing her, and if I were to see any
   quantity of ladies, I think I should know which was the Queen and which
   was not. You may say honestly that you know her to that extent.
   Beloved, every Christian must in this sense know Christ. You must know
   him by a divine illumination so as to know who he is and what line is.
   When Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Whom sayest thou that I am," he said,
   "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God;" and the Lord replied,
   "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjonas, for flesh and blood hath not
   revealed this unto thee." It is an early step in this knowledge of
   Christ, to know and to believe that Jesus Christ is Lord; to know that
   Christ is God, divine to me; that Christ is man, brother to me--bone of
   my bone and flesh of my flesh--that as such line is a sin-subduing
   Savior; that line is for inc an intercessor, pleading before the
   throne; my prophet, priest, and king--in this sense I trust that most
   of you know him. If you do not, breathe the silent prayer now, "Lord,
   help me that I may know him." But this knowledge of recognition is
   comparatively a low attainment, one of the lowest rounds of the ladder
   of light.

   In the second place, a believer knows Christ, to a higher degree when
   he knows him by practical experiment at acquaintance with what he does.
   For instance, I know Christ as a cleanser. They tell me he is a
   refiner, that he cleanses from spots; he has washed me in his precious
   blood, and to that extent I know him. They tell me that he clothes the
   naked; he hath covered me with a garment of righteousness, and to that
   extent I know him. They tell me that he is a breaker, and that he
   breaks fetters, he has set my soul at liberty, and therefore I know
   him. They tell me that he is a king and that he reigns over sin; he
   hath subdued my enemies beneath his feet, and I know him in that
   character. They tell me he is a shepherd: I know him for I am his
   sheep. They say he is a door: I have entered in through him, and I know
   him as a door. They say he is food: my spirit feeds on him as on the
   bread of heaven, and, therefore, I know him as such. You know if anyone
   says, "Do you know doctor So-and-so?" It is a very satisfactory answer,
   if you can reply, "Oh, yes, I know him, for he attended me the last
   time that I was ill." There is more knowledge in that, than if on could
   only say, " Oh, yes, I know him: he wears such-and-such a hat or "line
   is a man of such-and-such an appearance." So, Christian, thing is a
   second and higher step to know Christ, because you have experienced in
   your own soul that he is just what God has revealed him to be.

   But we know a man in a better sense than this when we are on speaking
   terms with him. "Do you know So-and-so?" " Yes," you say, I not only
   know him by name, so as to recognize him; I not only know him as a
   tradesman having dealt with him, but I know him because when we pass
   each other in the morning, we exchange a word or two; and if I had
   anything to say upon matters--any request to make--I should feel no
   difficulty about asking him." Well, now. the Christian knows his Lord
   in this sense, line has every day official communication with Christ,
   line is on speaking terms with him. There may be persons here, perhaps,
   who know the Queen in a sense in which I do not know her--perhaps they
   speak to him. They have so done; I have never done that; they go beyond
   me there. But you see, dear friends, this is not a very great thing
   because you may be on speaking terms with a man, but you may not know
   much of him for all that. So you may be in the habit of daily prayer,
   and you may talk with Christ every morning and every evening, and you
   may know exceedingly little of him. You are on speaking terms with him;
   but there ins something beyond this, very far beyond this. As I might
   say that I know a man merely because I meet him every day, and ask him
   for what I want, and understand that he is kind and generous; but how
   shallow is such an acquaintance, for I do not know his private
   character nor his inward heart. Even so a believer may have constant
   dealings with Christ in his prayers and in his praises, and yet for all
   that, he may have only gone a certain distance, and may have need still
   to pray, "That I may know him."

   But you are said to know a person better still when he invites you to
   his house. At Christmas time there is a family party and a romp, and he
   asks you there, and you are one of the children, and enter into all
   their sports around the fire-side, and you indulge as they do in the
   genialities of social life. You are asked again; you go there pretty
   often; in fact, if there is a happy evening in that house they
   generally expect to see friend So-and-so there. Well, now, that is
   better. We are getting now into something like knowing a man; and I do
   trust there are many of you, beloved, who have got as far as this with
   regard to your divine Lord. Christ has entertained you with some rare
   visits from his gracious presence. He brought you into the
   banquetting-house, and his banner over you was love. When he manifested
   himself, he did it unto you as he did not unto the world. He was
   pleased in the majesty of his condescension, to take you aside and show
   you his hands and his side. He called you "Friend;" he treated you as
   such, and permitted you to enjoy thine sweets of being one of the
   family.

   Ah, but you may go into a man's house as a constant visitor, and yet
   you may not know him--that is to say, not in the highest sense. You
   speak to the man's wife and say, "Your husband is a marvellously
   charming man; what a cheerful, joyful, spirited man he is; he never
   seems to have any depressions of spirit, and experiences no changes
   whatever." She shakes her head. and she says, "Ah! you do not know him,
   you do not know him as I do;" because shine sees him at all times and
   at all hours; she can read the very heart of the man. That Christian
   has grown much in grace who has advanced not only to be the friend of
   Christ, having occasional fellowship with him, but who comes to
   recognize his marriage-union with the person of his Lord, and of whom
   it can be said, "The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and
   he will show them his covenant," Now we have the intimacy of love, with
   its perfect frankness, nearness, sweetness, joyousness, delight. The
   rending away of every separating veil makes the communion to be as near
   as it well can be this side the black river; but a Christian may get
   farther than this.

   Even the spouse may not know her husband. The most loving wife who ever
   entered into the cares of her husband, must have discovered that there
   is a something which separates his experience from her powers of
   comprehension. Luther's wife. Catherine, was of all women the wife for
   Luther; but there were times in Luther's gigantic tribulations, when he
   must leave Kate behind. There were extraordinary times within him;
   times both of ecstatic joy, when like a great angel, he stretched his
   mighty wings, and flew right up to heaven, and of awful misery, when he
   seemed to sink down to the very depths of hell; and in either case, no
   other heart could keep pace with him. Then it was himself alone who had
   communion with himself. And a Christian may so grow in grace as to
   become identified with Christ, a member of his body; not so much
   married to him as a part of him, a member of the great body of Christ,
   so that he suffers with Christ, sympathizes with Jesus, his heart
   beating to the same dolorous tune, his veins swollen with the sumac
   floods of grief, or else his eyes sparkling with that same gleam of
   joy, according to the Master's Word, "That my joy might remain in you,
   and that your joy might be full."

   Well, have not you waded out of your depth some of you? I have
   certainly got out of my own. I feel as if the Master might come on to
   this platform, look round on many of us, and say, "Have I been so long
   time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip?" for truly even
   in the minor sense, though I trust we arc saved, though we have
   believed in Jesus, yet we have not reached the height of this great
   text--"That I may know him."

   III. Having taken you so far, let us SIT DOWN A FEW MINUTES AND
   CONSIDER WHAT SORT OF KNOWLEDGE THIS KNOWLEDGE OF CHRIST IS--"That I
   may know him."

   Then it is clear, if I know him I shall have a very vivid sense of his
   personality. "That I may know him." He will not be to me a myth, a
   vision, a spirit, bat a person, a real solid person, as much real as I
   am myself, or as my dearest friend can be to me. My soul, never be
   satisfied within a shadowy Christ. My heart, be thou never content
   until he hath embraced thy soul, and proved to thee that he is the
   lover of his people. This knowledge, then, must be a knowledge of him
   in his personality. Then, beloved, it must be a personal knowledge on
   our part. I cannot know Christ through another person's brains. I
   cannot love him with another man's heart, and I cannot see him with
   another man's eyes. Heaven's delight is, "Mine eyes shall see him and
   not another." These eyes shall behold the King in his beauty. Well,
   beloved, if this be heaven, we certainly cannot do without a personal
   sight of Christ here. I am so afraid of living in a second-hand
   religion. God forbid that I should get a biographical experience. Lord
   save us from having borrowed communion. No, I must know him myself. O
   God, let me not be deceived in this. I must know him without fancy or
   proxy; I must know him on mine own account.

   Then these few thoughts upon what sort of knowledge we must have. It
   must be an intelligent knowledge--I must know him. I must know his
   natures, divine and human. I must know his offices--I must know his
   attributes--I must know his works--I must know his shame--I must know
   his glory; for I do not know him if it be merely a subject of passion
   and not of intellect. I must let my head consciously meditate upon him
   until I own something like an idea of him, that I may "Comprehend with
   all saints what is the breadth, and length and depth, and height; and
   to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge."

   Then I must have an affectionate knowledge of him; and, indeed, if I do
   know him at all, I must love him. As it is said of some men, that there
   is such a charm about them, that if you once get into their company you
   cannot criticise any longer, but must admire; so you feel with Christ.
   It is said of Garibaldi, that if you are in his society he charms all,
   so that even malice and slander must be silent in his presence.
   Infinitely, supremely so is it with Christ. Being near him, his love
   warms our hearts, till we glow with intense love to him.

   Then I shall find, if I know Christ, that this is a satisfying
   knowledge. When I know Christ my mind will he fill to the brim--I shall
   feel that I have found that which my spirit panted after. "This is that
   bread whereof if a man eat he shall never hunger."

   At the same time it is an exciting knowledge; the more I know of
   Christ, the more I shall want to know. The deeper I plunge the greater
   the deeps which will be revealed. The higher I climb the loftier will
   be the summits which invite my eager footsteps. I shall want the more
   as I get the more. My spiritual thirst will increase, though in another
   sense it will be entirely quenched.

   And this knowledge of Christ will be a most happy one, in fact, so
   happy, that sometimes it will completely bear me up above all trials,
   and doubts, and sorrows; and it will, while I enjoy it, make me
   something more than "Man that is born of a woman who is of few days,
   and full of trouble;" for it will fling about me the immortality of the
   ever-living Savior, and gird me with the golden girdle of his eternal
   happiness. To be near to Christ, is to be near to the pearly gates of
   the golden-streeted city. Say not, "Jerusalem, my happy home, my labors
   have an end in thee;" but say, "Jesus, thou art my rest, and when I
   have thee, my spirit is at peace." I might thus keep on speaking in
   praise of this knowledge, but I will not.

   Only permit me to say, what a refreshing, what a sanctifying knowledge
   is this, to know him. When the Laodicean Church was neither hot nor
   cold, but lukewarm, how did Christ seek her revival? Did he send her
   precious doctrines? Did he send her excellent precepts? Mark you, he
   came himself, for thus it is said, "Behold, I stand at the door, and
   knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come into
   him, and will sup with him, and he with me." That is a cure for it all,
   you see. No matter how lukewarm, though God may say, "I will spue thee
   out of my mouth," yet, if Christ comes, that is the cure. The presence
   of Christ with his Church puts away all her sicknesses. When the
   disciples of Christ were at sea in a storm, do you recollect how he
   comforted them? Did he send them an angel? No. "It is I, line not
   afraid;" and when they knew him, then they had no more fears. They were
   assembled one night, "the doors being shut for fear of the Jews:" how
   did he comfort them? Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and
   said, "Peace be unto you." There was Thomas, full of doubts and fears.
   How did Jesus Christ take away his doubts? "Reach hither thy finger,
   and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my
   side." Oh! it is Christ, it is Christ who cures all. The company of
   Christ is the only thing which a Christian wants. I will undertake that
   if his heart be like an iceberg, as soon as Jesus comes, it shall flame
   like Vesuvius. His spirit shall be dead and like a rotten corpse; but
   if Jesus comes he shall leap like a hart, and become strong as a young
   unicorn. Thy presence makes me like the chariots of Amminadib. Now, do
   not think I am talking what I do not know. Do not imagine that I am
   talking mere fanatical slip-slop which I cannot prove. I do assert (and
   God who searcheth all hearts, knows how true this is), I do assert
   that, from the depths of doubt, of dullness, of worldliness, I have
   leaped in one moment into love, and life, and holy enthusiasm, when
   Jesus Christ has manifested himself to nine. I cannot describe the
   difference between my spirit, water-logged, worm-eaten, ready to sink
   to the bottom without Christ, and that same spirit, like a strong
   stanch ship, with sails full, with favorable wind, speeding into
   harbor, with a golden freight. Like you poor little bird which some
   cruel boy has torn from the nest and almost killed--it is not fledged
   yet, and cannot fly, and it lies down to die, trampled in the mire in
   the streets--that is my heart without Christ. But see that other bird!
   The cage-door is opened, its wings vibrate, it sings within all its
   might. and flies up to talk with the sun--that is my heart when I have
   the conscious presence of my Lord Jesus Christ! I only bring in my own
   consciousness because I do not know yours; but I think I will now
   venture to say that every believer here will admit it is the same with
   him--

   "Midst darkest shades if he appear

   My dawning is begun;

   He is my soul's bright morning star,

   And he my rising sun.

   IV. I shall close by urging you, dearly beloved, who know the Lord, to
   take this desire of the apostle, and by exhorting you, make it your
   own, "That I may know him." I wish I had time this morning--time will
   fly--I wish I had time to urge and press you, believers, onward to seek
   to know him. Paul, you see, gave up everything for this--you will be
   seeking what is worth having. There can be no mistake about this. If
   Paul will renounce all, there must be a reward which is worthy of the
   sacrifice. If you have any fears, if you seek Christ and find him, they
   will be removed. You complain that you do not feel the guilt of sin;
   that you cannot humble yourself enough. The sight of Christ is the very
   best means of setting sin in its true colors. There is no repenting
   like that which comics from a look of Christ's eye: the Lord turned and
   hooked upon Peter, and he went out and wept bitterly. So it is not a
   sight of the law, it is the sight of Christ looking upon us which will
   break our hearts.

   There is nothing like this to fill you with courage. When Dr. Andrew
   Reed found some difficulties in the founding of one of his orphan
   asylums, he sat down and drew upon a little piece of paper the cross,
   and then he said to himself, "What, despair in the face of the cross?"
   and then he drew a ring round the cross, and wrote in it nil
   desperandum! and took it for his coat of arms. Oh, there cannot be any
   despair in the presence of the cross. Thou dying Lamb, didst thou
   endure the cross, despising the shame, and shall I talk of difficulties
   when thy glory is in the way? God forbid! O holy face, bedewed with
   bloody sweat, I pledge myself in thy solemn and awful presence, that
   though this face of mine should be bedewed with sweat of the like sort,
   to accomplish any labor upon which thou shalt put me; by thy will and
   in thy strength, I will not shrink from the task. A sight of Christ,
   brethren, will keep you from despondency, and doubts, and despair. A
   sight of Christ! How shall I stir you to it? It will fire you to duty;
   it will deliver you from temptation; it will, in fact, make you like
   him. A man is known by his company; and if you have become acquainted
   with Christ, and know him, you will be sure to reflect his light. It is
   because the moon hath converse within the sun, that she hath any light
   for this dark world's night; and if you talk with Christ, the Sun, he
   will shine on you so gloriously, that you. like the moon, shall reflect
   his light, and the dark night of this world shall be enlightened by
   your radiance. The Lord help us to know him.

   But I do seem, this morning, to have been talking to you about him, and
   not to have brought him forward. O that I knew how to introduce you to
   him! You who do not love him, O that I could make you seek after him!
   But you who do love him and have trusted in him, O that I could make
   you hunger and thirst until you were filled with him! There he is,
   nailed to his cross, suffering--oh! how much!--for you; there he is,
   risen, ascended, pleading before the throne of God for you. Here he is:
   "Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world." Here he is,
   waiting to be comforted with your company, desiring communion with you,
   panting that his sister, his spouse, would be no longer a stranger to
   him. Here he is, waiting to be gracious, saying, "Come unto me all ye
   that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." Come,
   Christian, come, let this be thy desire, "That I may know him."

   And you who do not know him, and have not loved him, I pray you,
   breathe this prayer with me, " Lord, be merciful to me a sinner." O
   sinner, he is a gentle Christ; line is a loving Savior, and they that
   seek him early shall find him. May you seek and find him, for his
   name's sake. Amen.

                  Election no Discouragement to Seeking Souls

   A Sermon

   (No. 553)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, February 7th, 1864, by the

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "I will be gracious upon whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy
   upon whom I will show mercy."--Exodus 33:19.

   BECAUSE GOD IS THE MAKER, and creator, and sustainer of all things, he
   has a right to do as he wills with all his works. "Shall the thing
   formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? Hath not
   the potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto
   honor, and another unto dishonor?" God's absolute supremacy and
   unlimited sovereignty naturally flow from his omnipotence, and if it
   were not so, the superlative excellence of the divine character would
   entitle him to absolute dominion. He should be chief who is best. He
   who cannot err, being perfect in wisdom; he who will not err, being as
   perfect in holiness; he who can do no wrong, being supremely just; he
   who must act in accordance with the principles of kindness, seeing he
   is essentially love, is the most fitting person to rule. Tell me not of
   the creatures ruling themselves: what a chaos were this! Talk not of a
   supposed republic of all created existences, controlling and guiding
   themselves. All the creatures put together, with their combined wisdom
   and goodness--if, indeed, it were not combined folly and
   wickedness--all these, I say, with all the excellencies of knowledge,
   judgment, and love, which the most fervid imagination can suppose them
   to possess, could not make the equal of that great God whose name is
   holiness, whose essence is love, to whom all power belongeth, and to
   whom alone wisdom is to be ascribed. Let him reign supreme, for he is
   infinitely superior to all other existences. Even if he did not
   actually reign, the suffrages of all wise men would choose the Lord
   Jehovah to be absolute monarch of the universe; and if he were not
   already King of kings and Lord of lords, doing as he wills among the
   armies of heaven and the inhabitants of this lower world, it were the
   path of wisdom to lift him up to that throne. Since men have sinned,
   there becomes a yet further reason, or, rather a wider scope for the
   display of sovereignty. The creature, as a creature, may be supposed to
   have some claim upon the Creator; at least, it may expect that he shall
   not make it intentionally and despotically to put it to pain; that he
   shall not arbitrarily and without cause or necessity, cause its
   existence to be one of misery. I will not venture to judge the Lord,
   but I do think it is altogether incompatible with his goodness that he
   should have made a creature, and, as a creature, have condemned it to
   misery. Justice seems to demand that there shall be no punishment where
   there is no sin. But man has lost all his rights as a creature. If he
   ever had any, he has sinned them away. Our first parents have sinned,
   and we, their children, have attainted ourselves, by high treason
   against our liege lord and sovereign. All that a just God owes to any
   one of us on the footing of our own claim, is wrath and displeasure. If
   he should give to us our due, we should not longer remain on praying
   ground, breathing the air of mercy. The creature, before its Creator,
   must now be silent as to any demands upon him; it cannot require
   anything of him as a matter of right. If the Lord willeth to show
   mercy, it shall be so; but, if he withholds it, who can call him to
   account? "Can I not do as I will with mine own?" is a fit reply to all
   such arrogant enquiries; for man has sinned himself out of court, and
   there remains no right of appeal from the sentence of the Most High.
   Man is now in the position of a condemned criminal, whose only right is
   to be taken to the place of execution, and justly to suffer the due
   reward of his sins. Whatever difference of opinion, then, there might
   have been about the sovereignty of God as exercised upon creatures in
   the pure mass, there should be none, and there will be none, except in
   rebellious spirits, concerning the sovereignty of God over rebels who
   have sinned themselves into eternal ruin, and have lost all claim even
   to the mercy, much more the love of their offended Creator.

   However, whether we all of us agree to the doctrine that God is
   sovereign or not, is a very little matter to him, for he is so. De
   jure, by right, he should be so; de facto, as matter of fact, he is so.
   It is a fact, concerning which you have only to open your eyes and see
   that God acts as a sovereign in the dispensation of his grace. Our
   Saviour, when he wished to quote instances of this, spake on this wise:
   many widows there were in Israel in the time of Elias the prophet, but
   unto none of these was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon,
   unto a woman who was a widow. Here was election! Elias is not sent to
   nourish and to be nourished by an Israelitish widow, but to a poor
   idolatress across the border, the blessing of the prophet's company is
   graciously granted. Again our Saviour says, "Many lepers were in Israel
   in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them were cleansed,
   save only Naaman the Syrian"--not an Israelite at all, but one who
   bowed in the house of Rimmon. See how distinguishing grace finds out
   strange objects! Although our Saviour only gave these two instances,
   and no more, because they sufficed for his purpose, there are thousands
   of such cases on record. Look at man and the fallen angels. How is it
   that fallen angels are condemned to endless fire, and reserved in
   chains of darkness unto the great day? There is no Saviour for angels;
   no precious blood was ever shed for Satan. Lucifer falls, and falls for
   ever, never to hope again. There is no dispensation of mercy to those
   nobler spirits; but man who was made lower than the angels, is selected
   to be the object of divine redemption. What a great deep is here! This
   is a most illustrious and indisputable instance of the exercise of the
   prerogatives of divine sovereignty. Look again at the nations of the
   earth. Why is the gospel preached today, to us Englishmen? We have
   committed as many offenses--I will even venture to say we have
   perpetrated as many political crimes as other nations. Our eye is
   always prejudiced toward everything which is English; but if we read
   our history fairly, we can discover in the past, and detect in the
   present, grave and serious faults which disgrace our national banner.
   To pass by as minor offenses the late barbarities in Japan, and our
   frequent wars of extermination in New Zealand, and at the Cape, let it
   crimson the cheek of every inhabitant of the British Isles when we do
   but hint at the opium traffic with China. Yet to us the gospel is
   graciously sent, so that few nations enjoy it so fully as we do. It is
   true that Prussia and Holland hear the Word, and that Sweden and
   Denmark are comforted by the truth, but their candle burns but dimly;
   it is a poor flickering lamp which cheers their darkness, while in our
   own dear land, partly from the fact of our religious liberty, and yet
   more graciously through the late revival, the sun of the gospel shines
   brightly, and men rejoice in the light of day. Why this? Why no grace
   for the Japanese? Why no gospel preached to the inhabitants of Central
   Africa? Why was not the truth of God displayed in the Cathedral of
   Santiago, instead of the mummeries and follies which disgraced both
   dupes and deceivers, and were the incidental cause of the horrible
   burnings of that modern Tophet? Why today is not Rome, instead of being
   the seat of the beast, become the throne of Jesus Christ? I cannot tell
   you. But assuredly, divine sovereignty passing by many races of men,
   has been pleased to pitch upon the Anglo-Saxon family, that they may be
   as the Jews were aforetime, the custodians of divine truth, and the
   favorites of mighty grace.

   We need not further speak upon national elections, for the principle is
   plainly carried out in individuals. See ye anything, my brethren, in
   that rich publican whose coffers are gorged with the results of his
   extortion, when he climbs the sycamore-tree, that his short stature may
   not prevent his seeing the Saviour--see ye anything in him why the Lord
   of glory should halt beneath that sycamore-tree and say, "Zaccheus,
   make haste, and come down; for today I must abide at thy house?" Can
   you find me a reason why yonder adulterous woman, who has had five
   husbands, and who is now living with a man who is not her husband,
   should constrain the Saviour to journey through Samaria that he might
   tell her of the water of life? If you can see anything, I cannot. Look
   at that bloodthirsty Pharisee, hurrying to Damascus with authority to
   hail men and women to prison, and shed their blood. The heat of midday
   cannot stop him, for his heart is hotter with religious rage than the
   sun with noontide rays. But see, he is arrested in his career, a
   brightness shines round about him; Jesus speaks from heaven the words
   of tender rebuke; and Saul of Tarsus becomes Paul, the apostle of God.
   Why? Wherefore? What answer can we give but this? "Even so, Father, for
   so it seemed good in thy sight." Read the "Life of John Newton;" had he
   not ripened into the grossest of all villains? Turn to the history of
   John Bunyan, by his own confession the lowest of all blackguards, and
   tell me, can you find in either of these offenders any sort of reason
   why the Lord should have chosen them to be among the most distinguished
   heralds of the cross? No man in his senses will venture to assert that
   there was anything in Newton or Bunyan why they should engross the
   regard of the Most High. It was sovereignty, and nothing but
   sovereignty. Take your own case, dear friends, and that shall be the
   most convincing of all to you. If you know anything of your own heart,
   if you have formed a right estimate of your own character, if you have
   seriously considered your own position before the Most High, the
   reflection that God loveth you with an everlasting love, and that,
   therefore, with the bands of his kindness he has drawn you, will draw
   forth from you at once the exclamation, "Not unto us, O Lord, not unto
   us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy and for truth's sake."
   Brethren! the whole world is full of instances of divine sovereignty,
   for in every conversion some beam of the absolute dominion of God
   shines forth upon mankind.

   When a sinner is anxiously disturbed about his soul's affairs, his
   chief and main thought should not be upon this subject; when a man
   would escape from wrath and attain to heaven, his first, his last, his
   middle thought should be the cross of Christ. As an awakened sinner, I
   have vastly less to do with the secret purposes of God, than with his
   revealed commands. For a man to say, "Thou commandest all men to
   repent, yet will I not repent, because I do not know that I am chosen
   to eternal life," is not only unreasonable, but exceedingly wicked.
   That it is unreasonable you will clearly see on a moment's reflection.
   I know that bread does not of itself nourish my body, "For man shall
   not live by bread alone, but by every word which proceedeth out of the
   mouth of God." It depends, therefore, upon God's decree whether that
   bread shall nourish my body or not; for if he has not purposed that it
   shall, it may even choke me, and so become rather the cause of my death
   than the staff of my life. Do I therefore, when I am hungry, thrust my
   hands into my pockets and stand still, and refuse to help myself from
   the well-loaded table, because I do not know whether God has decreed
   that the bread shall nourish me or not? If I did, I should be an idiot
   or madman; or if in my senses, I should starve myself on such a
   pretence, I should richly deserve the burial of a suicide. I am not
   absolutely sure that there will be a harvest upon my field next year:
   unless God has ordained that the corn shall spring up and shall ripen,
   all my husbandry will be labor lost. There are worms in the earth,
   frosts in the air, birds in the sky, mildews in the winds--all of which
   may destroy my corn, and I may lose every single grain of the handsful
   which I throw into my furrows. Shall I, therefore, leave my farm to be
   one perpetual fallow, because I do not know whether God has decreed
   that there shall be a harvest or not next year? If I become a
   bankrupt--if I am unable to pay my rent--if the thorn and the thistle
   grow taller and higher, and if at last, my landlord thrusts me from my
   tenancy, all that men will say, will be, "It serves him
   right!"--because I was such a fool as to make the secret purposes of
   God a matter of paramount consideration, instead of performing my known
   duty. I am ill and sick: a physician comes to me with medicine. I am
   not clear that his medicine will heal me; it has healed a great many
   others, but if God has decreed that I shall die, I shall die, let me
   take any quantity of physic, or take none at all. My arm mortifies, but
   I will not have it cut off, because I do not know whether God has
   decreed that I shall die of mortification or not. Who but a crazed
   idiot, or raving maniac, would talk thus? When I put the case in that
   light, you all reply, "Nobody ever talks in that way; it is too
   absurd." Of course, nobody does. And the fact is, even in the things of
   God, nobody really does argue in that way. A man may say, "I will not
   believe in Christ, because I am afraid I am not elected;" but the thing
   is so stupid, so absurd, that I do not believe that any man, not
   absolutely demented, can be so grossly foolish as to believe in his own
   reasoning. I am far rather inclined to think that is a wicked and
   perverse method of endeavoring to stultify conscience, on the theory
   that a bad excuse is better than none, and that even a foolish argument
   is better than having one's mouth shut in speechless confusion.

   But since men will everlastingly be getting to his point, and there are
   so many who are always giving this as a reason why they do not believe
   in the Lord Jesus Christ, because, "It is not of him that willeth, nor
   of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy," I shall try, this
   morning, to talk with these people on their own ground; and I shall
   endeavor, by the help of the Holy Spirit, to show that the doctrine of
   the sovereignty of God, so far from discouraging anybody, has not in
   it, if regarded aright, any sort of discouragement whatever, for any
   souls believing in Jesus Christ.

   For one moment let me detain you from my object, while I reply to a
   very common method of misrepresenting the doctrine. It may be as well
   to start with a clear idea of what the doctrine really is. Our
   opponents put the case thus: suppose a father should condemn some of
   his children to extreme misery, and make others supremely happy, out of
   his own arbitrary will, would it be right and just? Would it not be
   brutal and detestable? My answer is, of course, it would; it would be
   execrable in the highest degree, and far, very far be it from us to
   impute such a course of action to the Judge of all the earth. But the
   case stated is not at all the one under consideration, but one as
   opposite from it as light from darkness. Sinful man is not now in the
   position of a well-deserving or innocent child, neither does God occupy
   the place of a complacent parent. We will suppose another case far
   nearer the mark, indeed, it is no supposition, but an exact description
   of the whole matter. A number of criminals, guilty of the most
   aggravated and detestable crimes, are righteously condemned to die, and
   die they must, unless the king shall exercise the prerogative vested in
   him, and give them a free pardon. If for good and sufficient reasons,
   known only to himself, the king chooses to forgive a certain number,
   and to leave the rest for execution, is there anything cruel or
   unrighteous here? If, by some wise means, the ends of justice can be
   even better answered by the sparing of the pardoned ones, than by their
   condemnation, while at the same time, the punishment of some tends to
   honor the justice of the lawgiver, who shall dare to find fault? None,
   I venture to say, but those who are the enemies of the state and of the
   king. And so may we well ask, "Is there unrighteousness with God? God
   forbid." "What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power
   known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to
   destruction: and that he might make known the riches of his glory on
   the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory, even us,
   whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?"
   Who is he that shall impugn the mingled mercy and severity of heaven,
   or make the eternal God an offender, because "he hath mercy on whom he
   will have mercy?" Let us now proceed to our proper subject, and
   endeavor to clear this truth from the terrors supposed to cluster
   around it.

   I. Let us begin with this assertion, which we are absolutely sure is
   correct: THIS DOCTRINE DOES NOT OPPOSE ANY COMFORT DERIVED FROM OTHER
   SCRIPTURAL TRUTHS.

   This doctrine, stern as it may seem to be, does not oppose the
   consolation which may be rightly derived from any other truth of
   revelation. Those who hold the free-will theory, say that our doctrine,
   that salvation is of the Lord alone, and that he will have mercy on
   whom he will have mercy, takes away from man the comfort derivable from
   God's goodness. God is good, infinitely good in his nature. God is
   love; he willeth not the death of any, but had rather that all should
   come to repentance. "As I live, saith the Lord, I have no pleasure in
   the death of him that dieth, but had rather that he should turn unto me
   and live." Our friends very properly insist upon it that God is good to
   all, and his tender mercies are over all his works; that the Lord is
   merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy; let me
   assure them that we shall never quarrel on these points, for we also
   rejoice in the same facts. Some of you have listened to my voice for
   these ten years: I ask you whether you have heard me utter a single
   sentence which at all contradicts the doctrine of God's great goodness?
   You may have so construed it by mistake, but no such teaching has
   passed my lip. Do I not, again and again, assert the universal
   benevolence of God--the infinite and overflowing goodness of the heart
   of the Most High? If any man can preach upon the great text, "God is
   love," though I may not be able to preach with the same eloquence, I
   will venture to view with him in the decision, heartiness, delight,
   earnestness, and plainness, with which he may expound his theme, be he
   who he may, or what he may. There is not the slightest shadow of a
   conflict between God's sovereignty and God's goodness. He may be a
   sovereign, and yet it may be absolutely certain that he will always act
   in the way of goodness and love. It is true that he will do as he
   wills; and yet it is quite certain that he always wills to do that
   which, in the widest view of it, is good and gracious. If the sons of
   sorrow fetch any comfort from the goodness of God, the doctrine of
   election will never stand in their way. Only mark, it does with a
   two-edged sword cut to pieces that false confidence in God's goodness
   which sends so many souls to hell. We have heard dying men singing
   themselves into the bottomless pit with this lullaby, "Yes, sir, I am a
   sinner, but God is merciful; God is good." Ah! dear friends, let such
   remember that God is just as well as good, and that he will by no means
   spare the guilty, except through the great atonement of his Son Jesus
   Christ. The doctrine of election, in a most blessedly honest manner
   does come in, and breaks the neck, once for all, of all this false and
   groundless confidence in the uncovenanted mercy of God. Sinner, you
   have no right to trust to the goodness of God out of Christ. There is
   no word in the whole Book of Inspiration, which gives the shadow of a
   hope to the man who will not believe in Jesus Christ. It says of him,
   "He that believeth not shall be damned." It declares of you, who are
   resting upon such a poor confidence as the unpromised favor of heaven,
   "Other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, Jesus Christ
   the righteous." If this be an evil to rob you of a false refuge, the
   doctrine of election certainly does this; but from the comfort properly
   derivable from the largest view of God's bounteous goodness and
   unlimited love, election does not detract a single grain.

   Much comfort, too, flows to a troubled conscience from the promise that
   God will hear prayer. "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye
   shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you, for every one that
   asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh
   it shall be opened." If you ask anything of God in the name of Jesus
   Christ, you shall receive it. Now, there are some who imagine that they
   must not pray because they do not know whether they are God's chosen
   people. If you refuse to pray on the ground of such bad reasoning as
   this, you must do so at your own expense; but do mark our solemn
   assurance, for which we have God's warrant, that there is nothing in
   the sovereignty of God which at all militates against the great truth,
   that every sincerely seeking soul, craving divine grace by humble
   prayer through Jesus Christ, shall be a finder. There may be an
   Arminian brother here who would like to get into this pulpit and preach
   the cheering truth, that God hath not said to the seed of Jacob, seek
   ye my face in vain. We not only accord him full liberty to preach this
   doctrine, but we will go as far as he can, and perhaps a little
   further, in the enunciation of that truth. We cannot perceive any
   discrepancy between personal election and the prevalence of prayer. Let
   those who can, vex their brains with the task of reconciling them; to
   us the wonder is how a man can believe the one without the other.
   Firmly must I believe that the Lord God will show mercy to whom he will
   show mercy, and have compassion on whom he will have compassion; but I
   know as assuredly that wherever there is a genuine prayer, God gave it;
   that wherever there is a seeker, God made him seek; consequently if God
   has made the man seek and made the man pray, there is evidence at once
   of divine election; and the fact stands true that none seek who shall
   not find.

   Very much comfort also is supposed to be derived, and naturally so,
   from the free invitations of the gospel. "Ah," cries one, "what a sweet
   thing it is that the Saviour cried, Come unto me all ye that labor and
   are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.' How delightful to read such
   a word as this, Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters,
   and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine
   and milk without money and without price,' Sir, my heart is encouraged
   when I find it written, Whosoever will, let him take the water of life
   freely.' But, sir, I dare not come because of the doctrine of
   election." My dear hearer, I would not say anything harshly to you, but
   I must express my conviction that this is nothing but an idle excuse
   for not doing what you have no mind to do; because invitations of the
   most general character, nay, invitations which shall be universal in
   their scope, are perfectly consistent with the election of God. I have
   preached here, you know it, invitations as free as those which
   proceeded from the lips of Master John Wesley. Van Armin himself, the
   founder of the Arminian school, could not more honestly have pleaded
   with the very vilest of the vile to come to Jesus than I have done.
   Have I therefore felt in my mind that there was a contradiction here?
   No, nothing of the kind; because I know it to be my duty to sow beside
   all waters, and like the sower in the parable, to scatter the seed upon
   the stony ground, as well as upon the good land, knowing that election
   does not narrow the gospel call which is universal, but only affects
   the effectual call, which is and must be from the Spirit of God. My
   business is to give the general call, the Holy Spirit will see to its
   application to the chosen. O my dear hearers, God's invitations are
   honest invitations to every one of you. He invites you; in the words of
   the parable he addresses, "All things are ready; come ye to the supper,
   my oxen and my fatlings are killed." Nay, he saith to his ministers,
   "Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in."
   Though he foreknows who will come in, and has before all worlds
   ordained who shall taste of that supper, yet the invitation in its
   widest possible range, is a true and honest one; and if you accept it
   you shall find it so.

   Furthermore, if we understand the gospel at all, the gospel lies in a
   nutshell. It is this:--"Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou
   shalt be saved." Or, to use Christ's words, "He that believeth and is
   baptized shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be damned."
   This promise is the gospel. Now, the gospel is true, whatever else may
   be false. Whatever doctrine may or may not be of God, the gospel
   certainly is. The doctrine of sovereign grace is not contrary to the
   gospel, but perfectly consonant therewith. God has a people whom no man
   shall number, whom he hath ordained unto eternal life. This is, by no
   means, in conflict with the great declaration, "He that believeth on
   him is not condemned." If any man who ever lived, or ever shall live,
   believes in Jesus Christ, he hath eternal life. Election or no
   election, if you are resting upon the rock of ages you are saved. If
   you, as a guilty sinner, take the righteousness of Christ--if all
   black, and foul, and filthy, you come to wash in the fountain filled
   with blood, sovereignty or no sovereignty, rest assured of this, that
   you are redeemed from the wrath to come. O my dear friends, when you
   say, "I will not believe in Christ because of election," I can only say
   as Job did to his wife, "Thou speakest as one of the foolish women
   speaketh." How dare you, because God reveals to you two things, which
   two things you cannot make square with one another--how dare you charge
   either the one or the other with being false? If I believe God, I am
   not only to believe what I can understand, but what I cannot
   understand; and if there were a revelation which I could comprehend and
   sum up as I may count five upon my fingers, I should be sure it did not
   come from God. But if it has some depths vastly too deep for me--some
   knots which I cannot untie--some mysteries which I cannot solve--I
   receive it with the greater confidence, because it now gives me
   swimming-room for my faith, and my soul bathes herself in the great sea
   of God's wisdom, praying, "Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief."

   Let it be said over and over again, that there shall be no doubt about
   this matter, that if there be any comfort derivable from the gospel; if
   there be any sweet consolation flowing from the free invitations and
   the universal commands of divine truth, all those may be received and
   enjoyed by you, while you hold this doctrine of divine sovereignty as
   much as if you did not hold it, and received some wider scheme.
   Methinks I hear one voice say, "Sir, the only comfort I can ever have
   lies in the infinite value of the precious blood of Christ; O sir, it
   seems to me such a sweet thing that there is no sinner so black that
   Christ cannot wash away his sins, and no sinner so old that the
   meritorious virtue of that atonement cannot meet his case--not one in
   any rank or in any condition whom that blood cannot cleanse from all
   sin. Now, sir, if that be true, how can the doctrine of election be
   true?" My dear friend, you know in your own heart that the two things
   are not opposed to each other at all. For what does the doctrine of
   election say? It says that God has chosen and has saved some of the
   greatest sinners who ever lived, has cleansed some of the foulest sins
   ever committed, and that he is doing and will do the same to the
   world's end. So that the two things exactly tally. And I will venture
   to say that if in the fulness of a man's heart he shall say, "There is
   no sin except the one excepted sin, which cannot be forgiven," if he
   boldly announce that "All manner of sin shall be forgiven unto men,"
   and if he shall plead with power and earnestness that souls would now
   come to Christ and lay hold upon eternal life, he may go back to his
   Bible, and he may read every text teaching the sovereignty of God, and
   every passage upholding divine election; nd he may feel that all these
   texts look him in the face, and say, "Well done, our spirit and your
   spirit are precisely the same; we have no conflict together; we are two
   great truths which came from the same God; we are alike the revelation
   of the Holy Ghost." But we leave that point. If there be any comfort,
   sinner, which you can truthfully and rightly get from any passage of
   Scripture, from any promise of God, from any invitation, from any open
   door of mercy, you may have it, for the doctrine of election does not
   rob you of one atom of the consolation which the truth of God can
   afford you.

   II. But now will take another point for a moment. Our second head is,
   that THIS DOCTRINE HAS A MOST SALUTARY EFFECT UPON SINNERS. These may
   be divided into two classes: those who are awakened, and those who are
   hardened and incorrigible.

   To the awakened sinner, next to the doctrine of the cross, the doctrine
   of distinguishing grace is perhaps the most fraught with blessings and
   comfort. In the first place, the doctrine of election, applied by the
   Holy Ghost, strikes dead for ever all the efforts of the flesh. It is
   the end of Arminian preaching to make men active, to excite them to do
   what they can; but the very end and object of gospel preaching is to
   make men feel that they have no power of their own, and to lay them as
   dead, at the foot of God's throne. We seek, under God, to make them
   feel that all their strength must lie in the Strong One who is mighty
   to save. If I can convince a man that, let him do what he may, he
   cannot save himself; if I can show him that his own prayers and tears
   can never save him apart from the Spirit of God; if I can convince him
   that he must be born again from above; if I lead him to see that all
   which is born of the flesh is flesh, and only that which is born of the
   spirit is spirit, brethren! three parts of the great battle are already
   won. "I kill and I make alive," saith God: "when a man is killed the
   work is half done." "I wound and I heal: when a man is wounded his
   salvation is commenced." What! am I to set a sinner industriously to
   labor after eternal life by his own works? Then, indeed, am I an
   ambassador of hell. Am I to teach him that there is a goodness in him
   which he is to evolve, to polish, and educate and perfect, and so to
   save himself? Then I am a teacher of the beggarly elements of the law
   and not the gospel of Christ. Are we to set forth man's prayers,
   repentings, and humblings as the way of salvation; if so, let us
   renounce the righteousness of Christ at once, for the two will never
   stand together! I am a mischief-maker if I excite the activities of the
   flesh instead of pointing to the arms of the Redeemer! But if the
   potent hammer of electing sovereignty dashes out the brains of all a
   man's works, merits, doings, and willings, while it pronounces over the
   dead carcass this sentence: "It is not of him that willeth, nor of him
   that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy;" then, the best thing is
   done for a sinner that can be done as a stepping-stone to the act of
   faith. When a man is weaned from self, and totally delivered from
   looking to the flesh for help, there is hope for him: and this the
   doctrine of divine sovereignty does through the Holy Spirit's power.

   Again, this doctrine gives the greatest hope to the really awakened
   sinner. You know how the case stands. We are all prisoners condemned to
   die. God, as sovereign, has a right to pardon whom he pleases. Now,
   imagine a number of us shut up in a condemned cell, all guilty. One of
   the murderers says within himself: "I know that I have no reason to
   expect to be delivered. I am not rich: if I had some rich relations,
   like George Townley, I might be found insane, and delivered. But I am
   very poor; I am not educated. If I had the education of some men I
   might expect some consideration. I am not a man of rank and position; I
   am a man without merit or influence, therefore I cannot expect that I
   should be selected as one to be saved." No, I believe that if the
   present authorities of our land were the persons to be taken into
   consideration, a man who was poor might have a very poor chance of
   expecting any gratuitous deliverance. But when God is the great
   sovereign the case is different. For then, we argue thus: "Here am I;
   my salvation depends entirely upon the will of God: is there a chance
   for me? We take down a list of those whom he has saved, and we find
   that he saves the poor, the illiterate, the wicked, the godless, and
   the worst of the worst, the base things, and things that are despised.
   Well, what do we say? Then, why may he not choose me? Why not save me?
   If I am to look for some reason in myself why I should be saved, I
   shall never find any, and consequently never shall have a hope. But if
   I am to be saved for no reason at all but that God wills to save me,
   ah! then there is hope for me. I will to the gracious King approach, I
   will do as he bids me, I will trust in his dear Son, and I shall be
   saved." So that this doctrine opens the door of hope to the worst of
   the worst, and the only persons it discourages are the Pharisees, who
   say: "Lord, I thank thee that I am not as other men are"--those proud,
   haughty spirits who say: "No! if I am not to be saved for something
   good in myself, then I will be damned!" as damned they will be with a
   vengeance, too.

   Moreover, do not you see, dear friends, how the doctrine of election
   comforts the sinner in the matter of power. His complaint is, "I find I
   have no power to believe; I have no spiritual power of any kind."
   Election stoops down and whispers in his ear--"But if God wills to save
   you, he gives the power, gives the life, and gives the grace; and
   therefore since he has given that power and might to others as weak as
   you, why not to you? Have courage, look to the cross of Christ and
   live." And oh! what emotions of gratitude, what throbbings of love does
   this doctrine cause in human hearts. "Why," saith the man, "I am saved
   simply because God would save me, not because I deserved it, but
   because his loving heart would save me; then, I will love him, I will
   live to him, I will spend and be spent for him." Such a man cannot be
   proud, I mean not consistently with the doctrine. He lies humbly at
   God's feet. Other men may boast of what they are, and how they have own
   eternal life by their own goodness, but I cannot. If God had left me, I
   had been in hell with others; and if I go to heaven, I must cast my
   crown at the feet of the grace which brought me there. Such a man will
   become kind to others. He will hold his opinions, but he will not hold
   them savagely, nor teach them bitterly, because he will say, "If I have
   light, and others have not, my light was given me from God, therefore,
   I have no cause to plume myself upon it. I will try to spread that
   light, but not by anger and abuse. For why should I blame those who
   cannot see, for could I have seen if God had not opened my blind eyes?"
   Every virtue this doctrine fosters, and every vice it kills, when the
   Holy Spirit so uses it. Pride it treads under foot, and humble,
   trustful confidence in the mercy of God in Christ, it cherishes as a
   darling child.

   My time is gone; but I wanted to have said a word as to the effect of
   this gospel upon incorrigible sinners. I will just say this: I know
   what the effect of it ought to be. What do you say who have made up
   your minds not to repent, you who care not for God? Why, you believe
   that any day you like you can turn to God, since God is merciful, and
   will save you; and therefore, you walk about the world as comfortably
   as possible, thinking it all depends upon you, and that you will get
   into heaven just at the eleventh hour. Ah! man, that is not your case.
   See where you are. Do you see that moth fluttering in my hand! Imagine
   it to be there. With this finger of mine I can crush it--in a moment.
   Whether it shall live or not depends absolutely upon whether I choose
   to crush it or let it go. That is precisely your position at the
   present moment. God can damn you now. Nay, let us say to you, "Yours is
   a worse position than that." There are some seven persons now doomed
   for murder and piracy on the high seas. You can clearly say that their
   lives depend upon Her Majesty's pleasure. If Her Majesty chooses to
   pardon them she can. If not, when the fatal morning comes, the bolt
   will be drawn and they will be launched into eternity. That is your
   case, sinner. You are condemned already. This world is but one huge
   condemned cell in which you are kept, until the execution morning
   comes. If you are ever to be pardoned, God must do it. You cannot
   escape from him by flight; you cannot bribe him by actions of your own.
   You are absolutely in the hand of God, and if he leaves you where you
   are and as you are, your eternal ruin is as certain as your existence.
   Now, does not this make some sort of trembling come upon you? Perhaps
   not; it makes you angry. Well, if it does, that will not frighten me,
   because there are some of you who will never be good for anything until
   you are angry. I believe it is no ill sign when some persons are angry
   with the truth. It shows that the truth has pierced them. If an arrow
   penetrates my flesh, I do not like the arrow, and if you kick and
   struggle against this truth, it will not alarm me; I shall have some
   hope that a wound is made. If this truth should provoke you to think,
   it will have done for some of you one of the greatest things in the
   world. It is not your perverse thinking which frightens me; it is the
   utterly thoughtless way in which you go on. If you had sense enough to
   consider these things and fight against them, I should then have some
   faint hope of you. But alas! many of you have not sense enough, you
   say, "Yes, yes, it is all true," you accept it, but then it has no
   effect upon you. The gospel rolls over you, like oil adown a slab of
   marble, and produces no effect.

   If you are at all right in heart, you will begin to see what your state
   is, and the next thing that will startle your mind will be the
   reflection: "Is it so? am I absolutely in God's hands? can he save me
   or damn me as he will? Then, I will cry to him, O God, save me from the
   wrath to come--from eternal torment--from banishment from thy presence.
   Save me, O God! What wouldst thou have me to do? Oh! what wouldst thou
   have me to do, that I may find thy favor and live?'" Then comes the
   answer to you:--"Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be
   saved;" for "whosoever believeth in him shall never perish, but shall
   have eternal life."

   O that God might bless this divine doctrine to you. I have never
   preached this doctrine without conversions, and I believe I never
   shall. At this moment God will cause his truth to attract your hearts
   to Jesus, or to affright you to him. May you be drawn as the bird is
   drawn by the lure, or may you be driven as a dove is hunted by the hawk
   into the clefts of the rock. Only may you be sweetly compelled to come.
   May my Lord fulfill this desire of my heart. O that God may grant me
   your souls for my hire; and to him shall be the glory, world without
   end. Amen.

                              Enduring to the End

   A Sermon

   (No. 554)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, February 14th, 1864, by the

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "He that endureth to the end shall be saved."--Matthew 10:22.

   THIS PARTICULAR TEXT was originally addressed to the apostles when they
   were sent to teach and preach in the name of the Lord Jesus. Perhaps
   bright visions floated before their minds, of honor and esteem among
   men. It was no mean dignity to be among the twelve first heralds of
   salvation to the sons of Adam. Was a check needed to their high hopes?
   Perhaps so. Lest they should enter upon their work without having
   counted its cost, Christ gives them a very full description of the
   treatment which they might expect to receive, and reminds them that it
   was not the commencement of their ministry which would win them their
   reward, but "He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved." It
   would be well if every youthful aspirant to the gospel ministry would
   remember this, if merely to put our hand to the plough proved us to be
   called of God, how many would he found so; but alas, too many look back
   and prove unworthy of the kingdom. The charge of Paul to Timothy, is a
   very necessary exhortation to every young minister: "Be thou faithful
   unto death." It is not to be faithful for a time, but to be "faithful
   unto death," which will enable a man to say, "I have fought a good
   fight." How many dangers surround the Christian minister! As the
   officers in an army are the chosen targets of the sharpshooters, so are
   the ministers of Christ. The king of Syria said to his servants, "Fight
   neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel;" even
   so the arch-fiend makes his main attack upon the ministers of God. From
   the first moment of his call to the work, the preacher of the Word will
   be familiar with temptation. While he is yet in his youth, there are
   multitudes of the softer temptations to turn the head and trip the feet
   of the youthful herald of the cross; and when the blandishments of
   early popularity have passed away, as soon they must, the harsh croak
   of slander, and the adder's tongue of ingratitude assail him, he finds
   himself stale and fiat where once he was flattered and admired; nay,
   the venom of malice succeeds to the honeyed morsels of adulation. Now,
   let him gird his loins and fight the good fight of faith. In his after
   days, to provide fresh matter Sabbath after Sabbath, to rule as in the
   sight of God, to watch over the souls of men, to weep with them who
   weep, to rejoice with those who do rejoice, to be a nursing father unto
   young converts, sternly to rebuke hypocrites, to deal faithfully with
   backsliders, to speak with solemn authority and paternal pathos to
   those who are in the first stages of spiritual decline, to carry about
   with him the care of the souls of hundreds, is enough to make him grow
   old while yet he is young, and to mar his visage with the lines of
   grief, till, like the Savior, at the age of thirty years, men shall
   count him nearly fifty. "Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast
   thou seen Abraham?" said the adversaries of Christ to him when he was
   but thirty-two. If the minister should fall, my brethren; if, set upon
   a pinnacle, he should be cast down; if, standing in slippery places, he
   should falter; if the standard-bearer fall, as fall full well he may,
   what mischief is done to the Church, what shouts are heard among the
   adversaries, what dancings are seen among the daughters of Philistia!
   How hath God's banner been stained in the dust, and the name of Jesus
   cast into the mire! When the minister of Christ turns traitor, it is as
   if the pillars of the house did tremble; every stone in the structure
   feels the shock. If Satan can succeed in overturning the preachers of
   the Word, it is as if yon broad-spreading tree should suddenly fall
   beneath the axe; prone in the dust it lies to wither and to rot; but
   where are the birds of the air which made their nests among its boughs,
   and whither fly those beasts of the field which found a happy shadow
   beneath its branches? Dismay hath seized them, and they flee in
   affright. All who were comforted by the preacher's word, strengthened
   by his example, and edified by his teaching, are filled with
   humiliation and grief, crying, "Alas! my brother." By these our
   manifold dangers and weighty responsibilities, we may very justly
   appeal to you who feed under our ministry, and beseech you, "Brethren,
   pray for us." Well, we know that though our ministry be received of the
   Lord Jesus, if hitherto we have been kept faithful by the power of the
   Holy Ghost, yet it is only he who endureth to the end who shall be
   saved.

   But, my brethren, how glorious is the sight of the man who does endure
   to the end as a minister of Christ. I have photographed upon my heart
   just now, the portrait of one very, very dear to me, and I think I may
   venture to produce a rough sketch of him, as no mean example of how
   honorable it is to endure to the end. This man began while yet a youth
   to preach the Word. Sprung of ancestors who had loved the Lord and
   served his Church, he felt the glow of holy enthusiasm. Having proved
   his capabilities, he entered college, and after the close of its
   course, settled in a spot where for more than fifty years he continued
   his labors. In his early days, his sober earnestness and sound doctrine
   were owned of God in many conversions both at home and abroad. Assailed
   by slander and abuse, it was his privilege to live it all down. He
   outlived his enemies, and though he had buried a generation of his
   friends, yet he found many warm hearts clustering round him to the
   last. Visiting his flock, preaching in his own pulpit, and making very
   many journeys to other Churches, years followed one another so rapidly,
   that he found himself the head of a large tribe of children and
   grandchildren, most of them walking in the truth. At the age of
   fourscore years, he preached on still, until laden with infirmities,
   but yet as joyful and as cheerful as in the heyday of his youth, his
   time had come to die. He was able to say truthfully, when last he spake
   to me, "I do not know that my testimony for God has ever altered, as to
   the fundamental doctrines; I have grown in experience, but from the
   first day until now, I have had no new doctrines to teach my hearers. I
   have had to make no confessions of error on vital points, but have been
   held fast to the doctrines of grace, and can now say that I love them
   better than ever." Such an one was he, as Paul, the aged, longing to
   preach so long as his tottering knees could bear him to the pulpit. I
   am thankful that I had such a grandsire. He fell asleep in Christ but a
   few hours ago, and on his dying bed talked as cheerfully as men can do
   in the full vigor of their health. Most sweetly he talked of the
   preciousness of Christ, and chiefly of the security of the believer;
   the truthfulness of the promise; the immutability of the covenant; the
   faithfulness of God, and the infallibility of the divine decree. Among
   other things which he said at the last was this, which is, we think,
   worth your treasuring in your memories. "Dr Watts sings--

   'Firm as the earth thy gospel stands,

   My Lord, my hope, my trust.'

   What, Doctor, is it not firmer than that? Could you not find a better
   comparison? Why, the earth will give way beneath our feet one day or
   another, if we rest on it. The comparison will not do. The Doctor was
   much nearer the mark, when he said--

   "Firm as his throne his promise stands,

   And he can well secure

   What I've committed to his hands.

   'Till the decisive hour.'"

   "Firm as his throne," said he, "he must cease to be king before he can
   break his promise, or lose his people. Divine sovereignty makes us all
   secure." He fell asleep right quietly, for his day was over, and the
   night was come, what could he do better than go to rest in Jesus? Would
   God it may be our lot to preach the Word, so long as we breathe,
   standing fast unto the end in the truth of God; and if we see not our
   sons and grandsons testifying to those doctrines which are so dear to
   us, yet may we see our children walking in the truth. I know of
   nothing, dear friends, which I would choose to have, as the subject of
   my ambition for life, than to be kept faithful to my God to death,
   still to be a soul-winner, still to be a true herald of the cross, and
   testify the name of Jesus to the last hour. It is only such who in the
   ministry shall be saved.

   Our text, however, occurs again in the twenty-fourth chapter of
   Matthew, at the fourteenth verse, upon which occasion it was not
   addressed to the apostles, but to the disciples. The disciples, looking
   upon the huge stones which were used in the construction of the Temple,
   admired the edifice greatly, and expected their Lord to utter a few
   words of passing encomium; instead of which, he, who came not to be an
   admirer of architecture, but to hew living stones out of the quarry of
   nature, to build them up into a spiritual temple turned their remarks
   to practical account, by warning them of a time of affliction, in which
   there should be such trouble as had never been before, and he added,
   "No, nor ever shall be." He described false prophets as abounding, and
   the love of many as waxing cold, and warned them that "He that endureth
   to the end, the same shall be saved." So that this solemn truth applies
   to every one of you.

   The Christian man, though not called to the post of danger in
   witnessing publicly of the grace of God, is destined in his measure to
   testify concerning Jesus, and in his proper sphere and place, to be a
   burning and a shining light. He may not have the cares of a Church, but
   he hath far more, the cares of business: he is mixed up with the world;
   he is compelled to associate with the ungodly. To a great degree, he
   must, at least six days in the week, walk in an atmosphere uncongenial
   with his nature: he is compelled to hear words which will never provoke
   him to love and good works, and to behold actions whose example is
   obnoxious. He is exposed to temptations of every sort and size, for
   this is the lot of the followers of the Lamb. Satan knows how useful is
   a consistent follower of the Savior, and how much damage to Christ's
   cause an inconsistent professor may bring, and therefore he emptieth
   out all his arrows from his quiver that he may wound, even unto death,
   the soldier of the cross. My brethren, many of you have had a far
   longer experience than myself; you know how stern is the battle of the
   religious life, how you must contend, even unto blood, striving against
   sin. Your life is one continued scene of warfare, both without and
   within; perhaps even now you are crying with the apostle, " wretched
   man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" A
   Christian's career is always fighting, never ceasing; always ploughing
   the stormy sea, and never resting till he reaches the port of glory. If
   my God shall preserve you, as preserve you he must, or else you are not
   his; if he shall keep you, as keep you he will if you have committed
   your souls to his faithful guardianship, what an honor awaits you! I
   have in my mind's eye, just now, one who has been for about sixty years
   associated with this Church, and who this week, full of years, and ripe
   for heaven, was carried by angels into the Savior's bosom. Called by
   divine grace, while yet young, he was united with the Christian Church
   early in life. By divine grace, he was enabled to maintain a consistent
   and honorable character for many years; as an officer of this Church,
   he was acceptable among his brethren, and useful both by his godly
   example and sound judgment; while in various parts of the Church of
   Christ, he earned unto himself a good degree. He went last Sabbath day,
   twice to the house of God where he was accustomed of late years to
   worship, enjoying the Word, and feasting at the Communion-table with
   much delight. He went to his bed without having any very serious
   illness upon him, having spent his last evening upon earth in cheerful
   conversation with his daughters. Ere the morning light, with his head
   leaning upon his hand, he had fallen asleep in Christ, having been
   admitted to the rest which remaineth for the people of God. As I think
   of my brother, though of late years I have seen but little of him, I
   can but rejoice in the grace which illuminated his pathway. When I saw
   him, the week before his departure, although full of years, there was
   little or no failure in mind. He was just the picture of an aged saint
   waiting for his Master, and willing to work in his cause while life
   remained. I refer, as most of you know, to Mr. Samuel Gale. Let us
   thank God and take courage--thank God that he has preserved in this
   case, a Christian so many, many years, and take courage to hope that
   there will be found in this Church, many, at all periods, whose grey
   heads shall be crowns of glory. "He that endureth to the end," and only
   he "shall be saved."

   But, dear friends, perseverance is not the lot of the few; it is not
   left to laborious preachers of the Word, or to consistent
   Church-officers, it is the common lot of every believer in the Church.
   It must be so, for only thus can they prove that they are believers. It
   must be so, for only by their perseverance can the promise be
   fulfilled, "He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved." Without
   perseverance, they cannot be saved; and, as saved they must be,
   persevere they shall through divine grace.

   I shall now, with brevity and earnestness, as God enables me, speak
   upon our text thus: perseverance is the badge of saints--the target of
   our foes--the glory of Christ--and the care of all believers.

   I. First, then, PERSEVERANCE IS THE BADGE OF TRUE SAINTS. It is their
   Scriptural mark. How am I to know a Christian? By his words? Well, to
   some degree, words betray the man; but a man's speech is not always the
   copy of his heart, for with smooth language many are able to deceive.
   What doth our Lord say? "Ye shall know them by their fruits." But how
   am I to know a man's fruits? By watching him one day? I may, perhaps,
   form a guess of his character by being with him for a single hour, but
   I could not confidently pronounce upon a man's true state even by being
   with him for a week. George Whitfield was asked what he thought of a
   certain person's character. "I have never lived with him," was his very
   proper answer. If we take the run of a man's life, say for ten, twenty,
   or thirty years, and, if by carefully watching, we see that he brings
   forth the fruits of grace through the Holy Spirit, our conclusion may
   be drawn very safely. As the truly magnetized needle in the compass,
   with many deflections, yet does really and naturally point to the pole;
   so, if I can see that despite infirmities, my friend sincerely and
   constantly aims at holiness, then I may conclude with something like
   certainty, that he is a child of God. Although works do not justify a
   man before God, they do justify a luau's profession before his fellows.
   I cannot tell whether you are justified in calling yourself a Christian
   except by your works; by your works, therefore, as James saith, shall
   ye be justified. You cannot by your words convince me that you are a
   Christian, much less by your experience, which I cannot see but must
   take on trust from you; but your actions will, unless you be an
   unmitigated hypocrite, speak the truth, and speak the truth loudly too.
   If your course is as the shining light which shineth more unto the
   perfect day, I know that yours is the path of the just. All other
   conclusions are only the judgment of charity such as we are bound to
   exercise; but this is as far as man can get it, the judgment of
   certainty when a man's life has been consistent through out.

   Moreover, analogy shows us that it is perseverance which must mark the
   Christian. How do I know the winner at the foot-race? There are the
   spectators, and there are the runners. What strong men! what
   magnificent muscles! what thews and sinews! Yonder is the goal, and
   there it is that I must judge who is the winner, not here, at the
   starting-point, for "They which run in a race run all, but one
   receiveth the prize." I may select this one, or that other person, as
   likely to win, but I cannot be absolutely sure until the race is over.
   There they fly! see how they press forward with straining muscles; but
   one has tripped, another faints, a third is out of breath, and others
   are far behind. One only wins--and who is he? Why, he who continueth to
   the end, So I may gather from the analogy, which Paul constantly allows
   us, from the ancient games, that only he who continueth till he reaches
   the goal may be accounted a Christian at all. A ship starts on a voyage
   to Australia--if it stops at Madeira, or returns after reaching the
   Cape, would you consider that it ought to be called an emigrant ship
   for New South Wales? It must go the whole voyage, or it does not
   deserve the name. A man has begun to build a house, and has erected one
   side of it--do you consider him a builder if he stops there, and fails
   to cover it in or to finish the other walls? Do we give men praise for
   being warriors because they know how to make one desperate charge, but
   lose the campaign? Have we not, of late, smiled at the boasting
   despatches of commanders, in fights where both combatants fought with
   valor, and yet neither of them had the common sense to push on to reap
   the victory? What was the very strength of Wellington, but that when a
   triumph had been achieved, he knew how to reap the harvest which had
   been sown in blood? And he only is a true conqueror, and shall be
   crowned at the last, who continueth till war's trumpet is blown no
   more. It is with a Christian as it was with the great Napoleon: he
   said, "Conquest has made me what I am, and conquest must maintain me."
   So, under God, conquest has made you what you are, and conquest must
   sustain you. Your motto must be, "Excelsior;" or, if it be not, you
   know not the noble spirit of God's princes. But why do I multiply
   illustrations, when all the world rings with the praise of
   perseverance?

   Moreover, the common-sense judgment of mankind tells us, that those who
   merely begin and do not hold out, will not be saved. Why, if every man
   would be saved who began to follow Christ, who would be damned? In such
   a country as this, the most of men have at least one religious spasm in
   their lives. I suppose that there is not a person before me, who at
   some time or other did not determine to be a pilgrim. You, Mr. Pliable,
   were induced by a Christian friend, who had some influence with you, to
   go with him some short way, till you came to the Slough of Despond, and
   you thought yourself very wise when you scrambled out on that side
   which was nearest to your own home. And even you, Mr. Obstinate, are
   not always dogged; you have fits of thoughtfulness and intervals of
   tenderness. My hearer, how impressed you were at the prayer meeting!
   how excited you were at that revival service! When you heard a zealous
   brother preach at the theater what an impression was produced! Ah! yes;
   the shop was shut up for a Sunday or two; you did not swear or get
   drunk for nearly a month, but you could not hold on any longer. Now, if
   those who were to begin were saved, why you would be secure, though you
   are at the present time as far from anything like religion, as the
   darkness at midnight is from the blazing light of midday. Besides,
   common sense shows us, I say, that a man must hold on, or else he
   cannot be saved, because the very worst of men are those who begin and
   then give up. If you would turn over all the black pages of villany, to
   find the name of the son of perdition, where would you find it? Why,
   among the apostles. The man who had wrought miracles and preached the
   gospel, sold his Master for thirty pieces of silver--Judas Iscariot,
   betrays the Son of Man with a kiss. Where is a worse name than that of
   Simon Magus? Simon "believed also," says the Scripture, and yet he
   offered the apostles money if they would sell to him the Holy Ghost.
   What an infamous notoriety Demas has obtained, who loved the present
   evil world! How much damage did Alexander the coppersmith do to Paul?
   "He did me much evil," said he, "the Lord reward him according to his
   works." And yet that Alexander was once foremost in danger, and even
   exposed his own person in the theater at Ephesus, that he might rescue
   the apostle. There are none so bad as those who once seemed to be good.
   "If the salt has lost its savor, wherewith shall it be seasoned?" That
   which is best when ripe, is worst when rotten; liquor which is sweetest
   in one stage, becomes sourest in another. Let not him that putteth on
   his armor boast as though he putteth it off; for even common sense
   teaches you, that it is not to begin, but to continue to the end which
   marks the time of the child of God.

   But we need not look to analogy and to mere common sense. Scripture is
   plain enough. What says John? "They went out from us." Why? Were they
   ever saints? Oh! no--"They went out from us, because they were not of
   us, for if they had been of us, doubtless they would have continued
   with us, but they went out from us, that it might be manifest that they
   were not of us." They were no Christians, or else they had not thus
   apostatized. Peter saith, "It hath happened unto them according to the
   proverb, the dog hath returned to its vomit, and the sow that was
   washed to her wallowing in the mire," indicating at once most clearly
   that the dog, though it did vomit, always was a dog. When men disgorge
   their sins unwillingly, not giving them up because they dislike them,
   but because they cannot retain them; if a favorable time comes, they
   will return to swallow once more what they seemed to abandon. The sow
   that was washed--ay, bring it into the parlour, introduce it among
   society; it was washed, and well-washed too; whoever saw so respectable
   a member of the honorable confraternity of swine before? Bring it in!
   Yes, but will you keep it there? Wait and see. Because you have not
   transformed it into a man, on the first occasion it will be found
   wallowing in the mire. Why? Because it was not a man, but a sow. And so
   we think we may learn from multitudes of other passages, if we had time
   to quote them, that those who go back into perdition are not saints at
   all, for perseverance is the badge of the righteous. "The righteous
   shalt hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall wax stronger
   and stronger." We not only get life by faith, but faith sustains it;
   "the just shall live by faith;" "but if any man draw back, my soul
   shall have no pleasure in him."

   What we have learned from Scripture, dear friends, has been abundantly
   confirmed by observation. Every day would I bless God that in so
   numerous a Church we have comparatively so few who have proved false;
   but I have seen enough, and the Lord knoweth, more than enough, to make
   me very jealous over you with a godly jealousy. I could tell of many an
   instance of men and women who did ran well. "What did hinder them that
   they should not obey the truth?" I remember a young man of whom I
   thought as favourably as of any of you, and I believe he did at that
   time deserve our favorable judgment. He walked among us, one of the
   most hopeful of our sons, and we hoped that God would make him
   serviceable to his cause. He fell into bad company. There was enough
   conscience left, after a long course of secret sin, to make him feel
   uncomfortable in his wickedness, though he did not give it up; and when
   at last his sin stared him in the face, and others knew it, so ashamed
   was he, that, though he bore the Christian name, he took poison that he
   might escape the shame which he had brought upon himself. He was
   rescued--rescued by skill and the good providence of God; but where he
   is, and what he is, God only knoweth, for he had taken another poison
   more deadly still which made him the slave of his own lusts.

   Do not think it is the young alone, however. It is a very lamentable
   fact that there are, in proportion, more backslidings among the old
   than the young; and, if you want to find a great sinner in that
   respect, you will find him, surely, nine times out of ten, with grey
   hairs on his head. Have I not frequently mentioned that you do not find
   in Scripture, many cases of young people going astray. You do find
   believers sinning, but they were all getting old men. There is Noah--no
   youth. There is Lot, when drunken--no child. There is David with
   Bathsheba,--no young man in the heat of passion. There is Peter denying
   his Lord--no boy at the time. These were men of experience and
   knowledge and wisdom. "Let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed
   lest he fall."

   With sorrow do we remember one whom, years ago, we heard pray among us,
   and sweetly too; esteemed and trusted by us all. I remember a dear
   brother saying very kindly, but not too wisely, "If he is not a child
   of God, I am not." But what did be, my brethren, to our shame and
   sorrow, but go aside to the very worst and foulest of sins, and where
   is he now? Perhaps the ale-house may tell or worse places still. So
   have we seen, that earth's sun may be eclipsed, earth's stars may go
   out, and all human glory melt into shame. No true child of God
   perishes--hold that fast; but this is the badge of a true child of God:
   that a man endures to the end; and if a man does not hold on, but
   slinks back to his old master, and once again fits on the old collar,
   and wears again the Satanic yoke, there is sure proof that he has never
   come out of the spiritual Egypt through Jesus Christ, his leader, and
   hath never obtained that eternal life which cannot die, because it is
   born of God. I have thus then, dear friends, said enough to prove, I
   think, beyond dispute, that the true badge of the Christian is
   perseverance, and that without it, no man has proved himself to be a
   child of God.

   II. Secondly, PERSEVERANCE IS THEREFORE, THE TARGET OF ALL OUR
   SPIRITUAL ENEMIES.

   We have many adversaries. Look at the world! The world does not object
   to our being Christians for a time; it will cheerfully overlook all
   misdemeanors in that way, if we will now shake hands and be as we used
   to be. Your old companions who used to call you such good fellows, when
   you were bad fellows, would they not very readily forgive you for
   having been Christians, if you would just go back and be as in days
   gone by? Oh! certainly, they would look upon your religion as a freak
   of folly, but they would very easily overlook it, if you would give it
   up for the future. "O!" saith the world, "come back; come back to my
   arms once more; be enamored of me, and though thou hast spoken some
   hard words against me, and done some cruel deeds against me, I will
   cheerfully forgive thee." The world is always stabbing at the
   believer's perseverance. Sometimes she will bully him back; she will
   persecute him with her tongue--cruel mockings shall be used; and at
   another time, she will cozen him, "Come thou back to me; O come thou
   back! Wherefore should we disagree? Thou art made for me, and I am made
   for thee!" And she beckons so gently and so sweetly, even as Solomon's
   harlot of old. This is the one thing with her, that thou shouldst cease
   to be a pilgrim, and settle down to buy and sell with her in Vanity
   Fair.

   Your second enemy, the flesh. What is its aim? "Oh! " cries the flesh,
   "we have had enough of this; it is weary work being a pilgrim, come,
   give it up." Sloth says, "Sit still where thou art. Enough is as good
   as a feast, at least, of this tedious thing." Then, lust crieth, "Am I
   always to be mortified? Am I never to be indulged? Give me at least, a
   furlough from this constant warfare?" The flesh cares not how soft the
   chain, so that it does but hold us fast, and prevent our pressing on to
   glory.

   Then comes in the devil, and sometimes he beats the big drum, and cries
   with a thundering voice "There is no heaven; there is no God; you are a
   fool to persevere." Or, changing his tactics, he cries, "Come back! I
   will give thee a better treatment than thou hadst before. Thou
   thoughtest me a hard master, but that was misrepresentation; come and
   try me; I am a different devil from what I was ten years ago; I am
   respectable to what I was then. I do not want you to go back to the low
   theater or the casino; come with me, and be a respectable lover of
   pleasure. I tell thee, I can dress in broad cloth as well as in
   corderoy, and I can walk in the courts of kings, as well as in the
   courts and alleys of the beggar. O come back!" he saith, and make
   thyself one of mine." So that this hellish trinity, the world, tine
   flesh, and the devil, all stab at the Christian's perseverance.

   His perseverance in service they will frequently attack: "What profit
   is there is in serving God? The devil will say to me sometimes, as he
   did to Jonah, "Flee thou unto Tarshish, and do not stop in this
   Nineveh; they will not believe thy word, though thou speak in God's
   name?" To you he will say, "Why, you are so busy all the six days of
   the week, what is the good of spending your Sunday with a parcel of
   noisy brats in a Sunday School? Why go about with those tracts in the
   streets? Much good you will get from it. Would not you be better with
   having a little rest?" Ah! that word rest--some of us are very fond of
   it; but we ought to recollect that we spoil it if we try to get it
   here, for rest is only beyond the grave. We shall have rest enough when
   once we come into the presence of our Lord. Perseverance in service,
   then, the devil would murder outright.

   If he cannot stay us in service, he will try to prevent our perse
   verance in suffering. "Why be patient any longer?" says he; "why sit on
   that dunghill, scraping your sores with a potsherd?--curse God, and
   die. You have been always poor since you have been a Christian; your
   business does not prosper; you see, you cannot make money unless you do
   as others do. You must go with the times, or else you will not get on.
   Give it all up. Why be always suffering like this?" Thus the foul
   spirit tempts us. Or you may have espoused some good cause, and the
   moment you open your mouth, many laugh and try to put you down. "Well,"
   says the devil, "be put down--what is the use of it? Why make yourself
   singularly eccentric, and expose yourself to perpetual martyrdom? It is
   all very nice," saith he, "if you will be a martyr, to be burnt at
   once, and have done with it; but to hang, like Lord Cobham, to be
   roasted over a slow fire for days, is not comfortable. Why," saith the
   tempter, "why be always suffering--give it up." You see, then, it is
   also perseverance in suffering which the devil shooteth at.

   Or, perhaps, it is perseverance in steadfastness. The love of many has
   waxed cold, but you remain zealous. "Well," saith he, "what is the good
   of your being so zealous? Other people are good enough people, you
   could not censure them: why do you want to be more righteous than they
   are? Why should you be pushing the Church before you, and dragging the
   world behind you? What need is there for you to go two marches in one
   day? Is not one enough? Do as the rest do; loiter as they do. Sleep as
   do others, and let your lamp go out as other virgins do." Thus is our
   perseverance in steadfastness frequently assailed.

   Or else, it will be our doctrinal sentiments. "Why," says Satan, "do
   you hold to these denominational creeds? Sensible men are getting more
   liberal, they are giving away what does not belong to them--God's
   truth; they are removing the old landmarks. Acts of uniformity are to
   be repealed, articles and creeds are to be laid aside as useless
   lumber, not necessary for this very enlightened age; fall in with this,
   and be an Anythingarian. Believe that black is white; hold that truth
   and a lie are very much akin to one another, and that it not does
   matter which we do believe, for we are all of us right, though we
   flatly contradict each other; that the Bible is a nose of wax to fit
   any face; that it does not teach anything material, but you may make it
   say anything you like. Do that," saith he, "and be no longer firm in
   your opinion."

   I think I have proved--and need not waste more words about it--that
   perseverance is the target for all enemies. Wear your shield,
   Christian, therefore, close upon your armor, and cry mightily unto God,
   that by his Spirit you may endure to the end.

   III. Thirdly, brethren, PERSEVERANCE IS THE GLORY OF CHRIST.

   That he makes all his people persevere to the end, is greatly to his
   honor. If they should fall away and perish, every office, and work, and
   attribute of Christ would be stained in the mire. If any one child of
   God should perish, where were Christ's covenant engagements? What is he
   worth as a mediator of the covenant and the surety of it, if he hath
   not made the promises sure to all the seed? My brethren, Christ is made
   a leader and commander of the people, to bring many souls into glory;
   but if he doth not bring them into glory, where is the captain's honor?
   Where is the efficacy of the precious blood, if it does not effectually
   redeem? If it only redeemeth for a time and then suffereth us to
   perish, where is its value? If it only blots out sin for a few weeks,
   and then perniits that sin to return and to remain upon us, where, I
   say, is the glory of Calvary, and where is the lustre of the wounds of
   Jesus? He lives, he lives to intercede, but how can I honor his
   intercession, if it be fruitless? Does he not pray, "Father, I will
   that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am;" and if
   they be not finally brought to be with him where he is, where is the
   honor of his intercession? Hath not the Pleader failed, and the great
   Mediator been dismissed without success? Is he not at this day in union
   with his people? But what is the value of union to Christ, if that
   union does not insure salvation? Is he not to-day at the right hand of
   God, preparing a place for his saints; and will he prepare a place for
   them, and then lose them on the road? Oh! can it be that he procures
   the harp and the crown, and will not save souls to use them? My
   brethren, the perishing of one true child of God, would be such
   dishonor to Jesus, that I cannot think of it without considering it as
   blasphemy. One true believer in hell! Oh! what laughter in the
   pit--what defiance, what unholy mirth! "Ah! Prince of life and glory,"
   saith the prince of the pit, "I have defeated thee; I have snatched the
   prey from the mighty, and the lawful captive I have delivered; I have
   torn a jewel from thy crown. See, here it is! Thou didst redeem this
   soul with blood, and yet it is in hell." Hear what Satan cries--"Christ
   suffered for this soul, and yet God makes it suffer for itself. Where
   is the justice of God?" Christ came from heaven to earth to save this
   soul, and failed in the attempt, and I have him here;" and as he
   plunges that soul into deeper waves of woe, the shout of triumph goes
   up more and more blasphemously--"We have conquered heaven! We have rent
   the eternal covenant; we have foiled the purposes of God; we have
   defeated his decree; we have triumphed over the power of the Mediator,
   and cast his blood to the ground!" Shall it ever be? Atrocious
   question! It can never be. They who are in Christ are saved. They whom
   Jesus Christ hath really taken into union with himself, shall be with
   him where he is. But how are you to know whether you are in union with
   Christ? My brethren, you can only know it by obeying the apostle's
   words, "Give all diligence to make your calling and election sure."

   IV. I close, therefore, with but a hint on the last point, PERSEVERANCE
   SHOULD BE THE GREAT CARE OF EVERY CHRISTIAN--his daily and his nightly
   care. O beloved! I conjure you by the love of God, and by the love of
   your own souls, be faithful unto death. Have you difficulties? You must
   conquer them. Hannibal crossed the Alps, for his heart was full of fury
   against Rome; and you must cross the Alps of difficulty, for I trust
   your heart is full of hatred of sin. When Mr. Smeaton had built the
   lighthouse upon the Eddystone, he looked out anxiously after a storm to
   see if the edifice was still there, and it was his great joy when he
   could see it still standing, for a former builder had constructed an
   edifice which he thought to be indestructible, and expressed a wish
   that he might be in it in the worst storm which ever blew, and he was
   so, and neither himself nor his lighthouse were ever seen afterwards.
   Now you have to be exposed to multitudes of storms; you must be in your
   lighthouse in the worst storm which ever blew; build firmly then on the
   Rock of Ages, and make sure work for eternity, for if you do these
   things, ye shall never fall. For this Church's sake, I pray you do it;
   for nothing can dishonor and weaken a Church so much as the falls of
   professors. A thousand rivers flow to the sea, and make rich the
   meadows, but no man heareth the sound thereof; but if there be one
   cataract, its roaring will be heard for miles, and every traveler will
   mark the fall. A thousand Christians can scarcely do such honor to
   their Master as one hypocrite can do dishonor to him. If you have ever
   tasted that the Lord is gracious, pray that your foot slip not. It
   would be infinitely better to bury you in the earth than see you buried
   in sin. If I must be lost, God grant it may not be as an apostate. If I
   must, after all, perish, were it not better never to have known the way
   of righteousness than after having known the theory of it, and
   something of the enjoyment of it, turn again to the beggarly elements
   of the world? Let your prayer be not against death, but against sin.
   For your own sake, for the Church's sake, for the name of Christ's
   sake, I pray you do this. But ye cannot persevere except by much
   watchfulness in the closet, much carefulness over every action, much
   dependance upon the strong hand of the Holy Spirit who alone can make
   you stand. Walk and live as in the sight of God, knowing where your
   great strength lieth, and depend upon it you shall yet sing that sweet
   doxology in Jude, "Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling,
   and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with
   exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Savior, be glory and majesty,
   dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen." A simple faith brings the
   soul to Christ, Christ keeps the faith alive; that faith enables the
   believer to persevere, and so he enters heaven. May that be your lot
   and mine for Christ's sake. Amen.

                               Nothing But Leaves

   A Sermon

   (No. 555)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, February 21st, 1864, by the

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "He found nothing but leaves."--Mark 11:13.

   MOST of the miracles of Moses were grand displays of divine justice.
   What were the first ten wonders but ten plagues? The same may be said
   of the prophets, especially of Elijah and Elisha. Was it not
   significant both of the character and mission of Elias when he called
   fire from heaven upon the captains of fifties; nor was he upon whom his
   mantle descended less terrible when the she-bears avenged him upon the
   mockers. It remained for our incarnate Lord to reveal the heart of God.
   The only begotten was full of grace and truth, and in his miracles
   pre-eminently God is set forth to us as LOVE. With the exception of the
   miracle before us, and perhaps, a part of another, all the miracles of
   Jesus were entirely benevolent in their character; indeed this one is
   no exception in reality, but only in appearance. The raising of the
   dead, the feeding of the multitude, the stilling of the tempest, the
   healing of diseases--what were all these but displays of the
   lovingkindness of God? What was this to teach us but that Jesus Christ
   came forth from his Father on an errand of pure grace?

   "Thine hands, dear Jesus, were not arm'd

   With an avenging rod,

   No hard commission to perform

   The vengeance of a God.

   But all was mercy, all was mild,

   And wrath forsook the throne,

   When Christ on his kind errand came

   And brought salvation down."

   Let us rejoice that God commendeth his love towards us, because in "due
   time Christ died for the ungodly."

   Yet, as if to show that Jesus the Savior is also Jesus the Judge, one
   gleam of justice must dart forth. Where shall mercy direct its fall?
   See, my brethren, it glances not upon a man, but lights upon an
   unconscious, unsuffering thing--a tree. The curse, if we may call it a
   curse at all, did not fall. on man or beast, or even the smallest
   insect; its bolt falls harmlessly upon a fig tree by the wayside. It
   bore upon itself the signs of barrenness, and perhaps was no one's
   property; little, therefore, was the loss which any man sustained by
   the withering of that verdant, mockery, while instruction more precious
   than a thousand acres of fig trees has been left for the benefit of all
   ages. The only other instance at which I hinted just now was the
   permission given to the devils to enter into the swine, and the whole
   herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the
   waters. In that case, again, what a mercy it was that the Savior did
   not permit a band of men to become the victims of the evil one. It was
   infinitely better that the whole herd of swine should perish than that
   one poor man should be rendered a maniac through their influence. The
   creatures choked in the abyss were nothing but swine--swine which their
   Jewish owners had no right to keep; and even then they did not perish
   through Jesus Christ's agency, but through the malice of the devils,
   for needs must even swine run when the devil drives.

   Observe, then, with attention, this solitary instance of stern judgment
   wrought by the Savior's hand. Consider seriously that if only once in
   his whole life Christ works a miracle of pure judgment, the lesson so
   unique must be very full of meaning. If there be hut one curse, where
   does it fall? What is its symbolic teaching? I do not know that I ever
   felt more solemnly the need of true fruitfulness before God than when I
   was looking over this miracle--parable--for such it may justly be
   called. The curse, you at once perceive, falls in its metaphorical and
   spiritual meaning upon those high professors who are destitute of true
   holiness; upon those who manifest great show of leaves, but who bring
   forth no fruit unto God. Only one thunderbolt, and that for boasting
   pretenders; only one curse, and that for hypocrites. O blessed Spirit,
   write this heart-searching truth upon our hearts!

   I. We will commence our exposition with the remark that THERE WERE MANY
   TREES WITH LEAVES ONLY UPON THEM, AND YET NONE OF THESE WERE CURSED BY
   THE SAVIOR, SAVE ONLY THIS FIG TREE. It is the nature of many trees to
   yield to man nothing but their shade. The hungering Savior did not
   resort to the oak or to the elm to look for food, nor could the fir
   tree, nor the pine, nor the box, offer him any hope of refreshment; nor
   did he breathe one hard word concerning them, for he knew what was in
   them, and that they neither were, nor pretended to be fruit-bearing
   trees. So, dear friends, there are many men whose lives bear leaves,
   but no fruit--and yet, thanks be unto God, almighty patience bears with
   them. They are allowed to live out their time, and then it is true they
   are cut down and cast into the fire; but while they are permitted to
   stand, no curse withers them: the longsuffering of God waiteth to be
   gracious to them. Here are some of the characters who have leaves but
   no fruit.

   There are thousands who ignorantly follow the sign and know nothing of
   the substance. In England, we think ourselves far in advance of Popish
   countries; but how much of the essence of Popery peeps out in the
   worship of very many! They go to Church or chapel, and they think that
   the mere going into the place and sitting a certain time and coming out
   again is an acceptable act to God: mere formality, you see, is mistaken
   for spiritual worship! They are careful to have their infants
   sprinkled, but what the ceremony means they know not; and without
   looking into the Bible to see whether the Lord commands any such an
   ordinance, they offer him their ignorant will--worship either in
   obedience to custom, or in the superstition of ignorance. What the
   thing is, or why it is, they do not enquire, but go through a
   performance as certain parrots say their prayers. They know nothing
   about the inward and spiritual grace, which the Catechism talks about,
   if indeed, inward spiritual grace could ever be connected with an
   unscriptural outward and visible sign. When these poor souls come to
   the Lord's Supper, their thoughts go no farther than the bread and
   wine, or the hands which break the one and pour out the other; they
   know nothing whatever of communion with Jesus, of eating his flesh and
   drinking his blood; their souls have proceeded as far as the shell, but
   they have never broken into the kernel to taste the sweetness thereof.
   They have a name to lives and are dead; their religion is a mere show;
   a signboard without an inn a well-set table without meat; a pretty
   pageant where nothing is gold, but everything gilt nothing real, but
   all pasteboard, paint, plaster, and pretense. Nonconformists, your
   chapels swarm with such, and the houses of the Establishment are full
   of the same! Multitudes live and die satisfied with the outward
   trappings of religion, and are utter strangers to internal vital
   godliness. Yet such persons are not cursed in this life! No, they are
   to be pitied, to be prayed for, to be sought after, with words of love
   and honest truth; they are to be hoped for yet, for who knoweth but
   that God may call them to repentance, and they may yet receive the life
   of God into their souls?

   Another very numerous class have opinion but not faith, creed but not
   credence. We meet them everywhere. How zealous they are for
   Protestantism! They would not only die for orthodoxy, but kill others
   as well. Perhaps it is the Calvinistic doctrine which they have
   received, and then the five points are as dear to them as their five
   senses. These men will contend, not to say earnestly, but savagely for
   the faith. They very vehemently denounce all those who differ from them
   in the smallest degree; and deal damnation round the land with amazing
   liberality to all who are not full weight according to the balance of
   their little Zoar, Rehoboth, or Jireh: while all the while the spirit
   of Christ, the love of the Spirit, bowels of compassion, and holiness
   of character are no more to be expected from them than grapes from
   thorns, or figs from thistles. Doctrine, my brethren, is to be prized
   above all price! Woe to the Church of God when error shall be thought a
   trifle, for truth be lightly esteemed; and when truth is gone, what is
   left? But, at the same time, we grossly mistake if we think that
   orthodoxy of creed will save us. I am sick of those cries of "the
   truth," "the truth," "the truth," from men of rotten lives and unholy
   tempers. There is an orthodox as well as a heterodox road to hell, and
   the devil knows how to handle Calvinists quite as well as Arminians. No
   pale of any Church can insure salvation, no form of doctrine can
   guarantee to us eternal life. "Ye must be born again." Ye must bring
   forth fruits meet for repentance. "Every tree which bringeth not forth
   fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire." Stopping short of vital
   union to the Lord Jesus by real faith, we miss the great qualification
   for entering heaven. Yet the time is not come when these mere
   head-knowers are cursed. These trees have leaves only, but no fatal
   curse has withered them hopelessly. No; they are to be sought after;
   they may yet know the Lord in their hearts, and the Holy Spirit may yet
   make them humble followers of the Lamb. O that it may be so!

   A third class have talk without feeling. Mr. Talkative, in "Pilgrim's
   Progress," is the representative of a very numerous host. They speak
   very glibly concerning divine things. Whether the topic be doctrinal,
   experimental, or practical, they talk fluently upon everything. But
   evidently, the whole thing comes from the throat and the lip; there is
   no welling up from the heart. If the thing came from the heart it would
   be boiling, but now it hangs like an icicle from their lips. You know
   them--you may learn something from them, but all time while you are
   yourself aware that if they bless others by their words, they
   themselves remain unblessed. Ah! let us be very anxious lest this
   should be our own case. Let the preacher feel the anxiety of the
   apostle Paul, lest, after having preached to others, he himself should
   be a castavay; and let my hearers feel the same concern, lest, after
   talking about the timings of God, they should prove to be mere
   lip-servers, and not accepted children of the Most High.

   Another tribe springs up just now before my eye--those who have regrets
   without repentance. Many of you under a heart-searching sermon feel
   grieved on account of your sins, and yet never have the strength of
   mind to give them up. You say you are sorry, but yet go on in the same
   course. You do really feel, when death and judgment press upon you, a
   certain sort of regret that you could have been so foolish, but the
   next day the strength of temptation is such, that you fall a prey to
   the very same infatuation. It is easy to bring a man to the river of
   regret, but you cannot make him drink the water of repentance. If Agag
   would be killed with words, no Amalekite would live. If men's transient
   sorrows for sin were real repentance on account of it, there is not a
   man living who would not, sometime or other, have been a true penitent.
   Here, however, are leaves only, and no fruit.

   We have yet again, another class of persons who have resolves without
   action. They will! Ah! that they will! but it is always in the future
   tense. They are hearers, and they are even feelers, but they are not
   doers of the Word: it never comes to that. They would be free, but they
   have not patience to file their fetters, nor grace to submit their
   manacles to the hammer. They see the right, but they permit the wrong
   to rule them. They are charmed with the beauties of holiness, and yet
   deluded with the wantonness of sin. They would ran in the ways of God's
   commandments, but the road is too rough, and running is weary work.
   They would fight for God, but victory is hardly won, and so they turn
   back almost as soon as they have set out; they put their hand to the
   plough, and then prove utterly unworthy of the kingdom.

   The great majority of persons who have any sort of religion at all,
   bear heaves, but they produce no fruit. I know there are some such
   here, and I solemnly warn you, though no curse falls upon you, though
   we do not think that the miracle now under consideration has any
   relation to you whatever, yet remember, there is nothing to be done
   with trees which bring forth only leaves, but in due time to use the
   axe upon them, and to cast them into the fire: and this must be your
   doom. As sure as you live under the sound of the gospel, and yet are
   not converted by it, so surely will you be cast into outer darkness. As
   certainly as Jesus Christ invites you, and ye will not come, so
   certainly will he send his angels to gather the dead branches together,
   and you among them, to cast them into the fire. Beware! beware! thou
   fruitless tree! thou shalt not stand for ever! Mercy waters thee with
   her tears now; God's lovingkindness digs about thee still; still the
   husbandman comes, seeking fruit upon thee year after year. Beware! the
   edge of the axe is sharp, and the arm which wields it is nothing less
   than almighty. Beware! lest thou fall into the fire!

   II. Secondly, THERE WERE OTHER TREES WITH NEITHER LEAVES NOR FRUIT, AND
   NONE OF THESE WERE CURSED!

   The time of figs was not yet come. Now, as the fig tree either brings
   forth the fig before the leaf, or else produces figs and leaves at the
   same time, the major part of the trees, perhaps all of them, without
   exception of this one, were entirely without figs and without leaves,
   and yet Jesus did not curse any one of them, for the time of figs was
   not yet come.

   What multitudes are destitute of anything like religion; they make no
   profession of it; they not only have no fruits of godliness, but they
   have no leaves even of outward respect to it; they do not frequent the
   court of the Lord's house; they use no form of prayer; they never
   attend upon ordinances. The great outlying mass of this huge city--how
   does religion affect it? It is a very sad thing to think that there are
   people living in total darkness next door to the light; that you may
   find in the very street where the gospel is preached, persons who have
   never heard a sermon. Are there not, throughout this city, tens and
   hundreds of thousands who know not their right hand from their left, in
   matters of godliness? Their children go to Sabbath schools, but they
   themselves spend the whole Sabbath day in anything except the worship
   of God! In our country parishes, very often neither the religion of the
   Establishment nor of Dissent, at all affects the population. Take, for
   instance, that village which will be disgracefully remembem'ed as long
   as Essex endures, the village of Hedingham. Theme are in that place not
   only parish Churches, but Dissenting meetinghouses, and yet the persons
   who foully murdered the poor wretch supposed to be a wizard, must have
   been as ignorant and indifferent to common sense, let alone religion,
   as even Hottentots or Kaffirs, to whom the light of religion has never
   come. Why was this? Is it not because there is not enough of missionary
   spirit among Christian people to seek out those who are in the lowest
   strata of society, so that multitudes escape without ever coming into
   contact with godliness at all? In London, the City Missionaries will
   bear witness that while they can sometimes get at the wives, yet there
   are thousands of husbands who are necessarily away at the time of the
   missionary's visit, who have not a word of rebuke, or exhortation, or
   invitation, or encouragement, ever sounding in their ears at all, from
   the day of their birth to the day of their death; and they might, for
   all practical purposes, as well have been born in the center of Africa
   as in the city of London, for they are without God, without hope,
   aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, far oft; not by wicked works
   only, but by dense ignorance of God.

   These persons we may divide into two classes, upon neither of whom does
   the withering curse fall in this life. The first we look upon with
   hope. Although we see neither leaves nor fruit, we know that "the time
   of figs is not yet." They are God's elect, but they are not called.
   Their names are in the Lamb's Book of Life, and were there from before
   the foundations of the world; though they be dead in trespasses, they
   are the objects of divine love, and they must, in due time, be called
   by irresistible grace, and turned from darkness to light. "The Lord
   hath much people in this city," and this should be the encouragement of
   every one of you, to try to do good, that God has among the vilest of
   the vile, the most reprobate, the most debauched and drunken, an elect
   people who must be saved. When you take the Word to them, you do so
   because God has ordained you to be the messenger of life to their
   souls, and they must receive it, for so the decree of predestination
   runs; they must he called in the fullness of time to be the brethren of
   Christ and children of the Most High. They are redeemed, beloved
   friends, but not regenerated--as much redeemed with precious blood as
   the saints before the eternal throne. They are Christ's property, and
   yet perhaps, they are waiting around the ale-house at this very moment
   until the door shall open--bought with Jesus' precious blood, and yet
   spending their nights in a brothel, and their days in sin; but if Jesus
   Christ purchased them he will have them. If he counted down the
   precious drops, God is not unfaithful to forget the price which his Son
   has paid. He will not suffer his substitution to be in any case an
   ineffectual, dead thing. Tens of thousands of redeemed ones are not
   regenerated yet, but regenerated they must be; and this is your comfort
   and mine, when we go out with the quickening Word of God. Nay, more,
   these ungodly ones are prayed for by Christ before the throne. "Neither
   pray I for these alone," saith the great Intercessor, "but for them
   also which shall believe on me through their word." They do not pray
   for themselves; poor, ignorant souls, they do not know anything about
   prayer; but Jesus prays for them. Their names are on his breast, and
   ere long they must bow their stubborn knee, breathing the penitential
   sigh before the throne of grace. "The time of figs is not yet." The
   predestinated moment has not struck; but, when it comes, they shall,
   for God will have his own; they must, for the Spirit is not to be
   withstood when he cometh forth with power--they must become the willing
   servants of the living God. "My people shall be willing in the day of
   my power." "He shall justify many." "He shall see of the travail of his
   soul." "He shall divide a portion with the great, and he shall divide
   the spoil with the strong."

   No curse falls upon these; they deserve it, but eternal love prevents
   it. Their sins write it, but the finished sacrifice blots it out. They
   may well perish because they seek not mercy, but Christ intercedes for
   them, and live they shall.

   Alas! however, among those who have neither leaves nor fruit, there is
   another class which never bring forth either the one or the other; they
   live in sin and die in ignorance, perishing without hope. As these
   leave the world, can they upbraid us for neglecting them? Are we clear
   of their blood? May not the blood of many of them cry from the ground
   against us? As they arc condemned on account of sins, may they not
   accuse us because we did not take the gospel to them, but left them
   where they were? Dread thought! but let it not be shaken off, there are
   tens of thousands every day who pass into the world of spirits unsaved,
   and inherit the righteous wrath of God. Yet in this life, you see, no
   special curse falls upon them, and this miracle has no special bearing
   upon them; it bears upon a totally different class of people, of whom
   we will now speak.

   III. WE HAVE BEFORE US A SPECAL CASE.

   I have already said, that in a fig tree, the fruit takes the precedence
   of the leaves, or the leaves and the fruit come at the same time; so
   that it is laid down as a general rule, that if there be leaves upon a
   fig tree, you may rightly expect to find fruit upon it.

   To begin then with the explanation of this special case, in a fig tree
   fruit comes before leaves. So in a true Christian, fruit always takes
   the precedence of profession. Find a man anywhere who is a true servant
   of God, and before he united himself with the Church, or attempted to
   engage in public prayer, or to identify himself with the people of God,
   he searched to see whether he had real repentance on account of sin--he
   desired to know whether he had a sincere and genuine faith in the Lord
   Jesus Christ, and he perhaps tarried some little time to try himself to
   see whether there were the fruits of holiness in his daily life.
   Indeed, I may say that there are some who wait too long; they are so
   afraid lest they should make a profession before they have grace in
   possession, that they will wait year after year--too long--become
   unwise, and make what was a virtue become a vice. Still this is the
   rule with Christians: they first give themselves to the Lord and
   afterwards to the Lord's people according to his will. You who are the
   servants of God--do you not scorn to vaunt yourselves beyond your line
   and measure? Would you not think it disgraceful on your part to profess
   anything which you have not felt? Do you not feel a holy jealousy when
   you are teaching others, lest you should teach more than God has taught
   you? and are you not afraid even in your prayers lest you should use
   expressions which are beyond your own depth of meaning? I am sure the
   true Christian is always afraid of anything like having the leaves
   before he has the fruit.

   Another remark follows from this--where we see the leaves we have a
   right to expect the fruit. When I see a man a Church-member, when I
   hear him engage in prayer, I expect to see in him, holiness, the
   character and the image of Christ. I have a right to expect it, because
   the man has solemnly avowed that he is the partaker of divine grace.
   You cannot join a Church without taking upon yourselves very solemn
   responsibilities. What do you desire when you come to see us, and ask
   to be admitted into fellowship? You tell us that you have passed from
   death unto life, that you have been born again, that there has been a
   change in you, the hike of which you never knew before, one which only
   God could have wrought. You tell us you are in the habit of private
   prayer; that you have a desire for the conversion of others. If you did
   not so profess, we dare not receive you. Well now, having made these
   professions, it would be insincere on our part if we did not expect to
   see your characters holy, and your conversation correct; we have a
   right to expect it from your own professions. We have a right to expect
   it from the work of the Spirit which you claim to have received. Shall
   the Holy Spirit work in man's heart to produce a trifle? Do you think
   that the Spirit of God would have written us this Book, and that Jesus
   Christ would have shed his precious blood to produce a hypocrite? Is an
   inconsistent Christian the highest work of God? I suppose God's plan of
   salvation to be that which has more exercised his thoughts and wisdom
   than the making of all worlds and the sustenance of all providence; and
   shall this best, this highest, this darling work of God, produce no
   more than that poor, mean, talking, unacting, fruitless deceiver? Ye
   have no love for souls, no care for the spread of the Redeemer's
   kingdom, and yet think that the Spirit, has made you what you are! No
   zeal, no melting bowels of compassion, no cries of earnest entreaty, no
   wrestling with God, no holiness, no self-denial, and yet say that you
   are a vessel made by the Master and fitted for his use! How can this
   be? No; if you profess to be a Christian, from the necessity of the
   Spirit's work, we have a right to expect fruit from you. Besides, in
   genuine professors we do get the fruit, we see a faithful attachment to
   the Redeemer's cause, an endurance to the end, in poverty, in sickness,
   in shame, in persecution. We see other professors holding fast to the
   truth, they are not led aside by temptation, neither do they disgrace
   the cause they have espoused; and, if you profess to be one of the same
   order, we have a right to look for the same blessed fruits of the
   Spirit in you, and if we see them not you have belied us.

   Observe further that our Lord hungers for fruit. A hungry person seeks
   for something which may satisfy him, for fruit, not leaves! Jesus
   hungers for your holiness. A strong expression, you will say, but I
   doubt not of its accuracy. For what were we elected? We were
   predestinated to be conformed unto the image of God's Son; we were
   chosen to good works, "which God hath before ordained that we should
   walk in them." What is the end of our redemption? Why did Jesus Christ
   die? " He gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all
   iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good
   works." Why have we been called but that we should be called to be
   saints? To what end are any of the great operations of the covenant of
   grace? Do they not all point at our holiness? If you will think of any
   privilege which the Lord confers upon his people through Christ, you
   will perceive that they all aim at the sanctification of the chosen
   people--the making of them to bring forth fruit that God the Father may
   be glorified in them. O Christian, for this the tears of the Savior!
   for this the agony and bloody sweat! for this the five death-wounds!
   for this the burial and the resurrection, that he makes you holy, even
   perfectly holy like unto himself! And can it be, that when he hungers
   after fruit, you think nothing of fruit-bearing? O professor, how base
   art thou, to call thyself a blood-bought child of God, amid yet to live
   unto thyself! How darest thou, O barren tree, professing to be watered
   by the bloody sweat, and digged by the griefs and woes of the wounded
   Savior--how darest thou bring forth leaves and no fruit? Oh!
   sacrilegious mockery of a hungry Savior! oh! blasphemous tantalizing of
   a hungry Lord! that thou shouldst profess to have cost him all this,
   and yet yield him nothing! When I think that Jesus hungers after fruit
   in me, it stirs me tip to do more for him. Does it not have the same
   effect on you? He hungers for your good works; he hungers to see you
   useful. Jesus the King of kings, hungers after your prayers--hungers
   after your anxieties for the souls of others; and nothing ever will
   satisfy him for the travail of his soul but seeing you wholly devoted
   to his cause.

   This brings us into the very midst and meaning of the miracle. There
   are some, then, who make unusual profession, and yet disappoint the
   Savior in his just expectations. The Jews did this. When Jesus Christ
   came it was not the time of figs. The time for great holiness was after
   the coming of Christ and the pouring out of the Spirit. All the other
   nations were without leaves. Greece, Rome, all these showed no signs of
   progress; but there was the Jewish nation covered with leaves. They
   professed already to have obtained the blessings which he came to
   bring. There stood the Pharisee with his long prayers; there were the
   lawyers and the Scribes with their deep knowledge of the things of the
   kingdom. They said they had the light. The time of figs was not come,
   but yet they had the leaves, though not a single fruit; and you know
   what a curse fell on Israel; how in the day of Jerusalem's destruction
   the tree was withered altogether from its root, because it had its
   leaves, but had no fruit.

   The same will be true of any Church. There are times when all the
   Churches seem sunken alike in lethargy--such a time we had, say ten
   years ago--but one Church, perhaps, seems to be all alive. The
   congregations are large. Much, apparently, is proposed for the growth
   of the Savior's kingdom. A deal of noise is made about it; there is
   much talk, and the people are all expectation; and, if there be no
   fruit, no real consecration to Christ, if there be no genuine
   liberality, no earnest vital godliness, no hallowed consistency, other
   Churches may live on; but such a Church as this, making so high a
   profession, and being so precocious in the produce of leaves, shall
   have a curse from God. No man shall eat fruit of it for ever, and it
   shall wither away.

   In the case of individuals the moral of our miracle runs thus. Some are
   looked upon as young believers, who early join the Church. "The time of
   figs is not yet;" it is not a very ordinary case to see children
   converted, but we do see some, and we are very grateful. We are jealous
   however lest we should see leaves but not fruit. These juveniles are
   extraordinary cases; and on that account we look for higher results.
   When we are disappointed what shall come upon such but a curse upon
   their precocity, which led them to the deception. Some of us were
   converted, or profess to have been, when young, and if we have lived
   hitherto, and all we have produced has been merely words, resolves,
   professions, but not fruit unto God, we must expect the curse.

   Again, professsors eminent in station. There are necessarily but few
   ministers, but few Church officers; but when men so distinguish
   themselves by zeal, or by louder professions than others, as to gain
   the ear of the Christian public and are placed in responsible
   positions--if they bring forth no fruit, they are the persons upon whom
   the curse will light. It may be with other Christians that "the time of
   figs is not yet;" they have not made the advances which these profess
   to have made; but having been, upon their own profession, elected to an
   office which essentially requires fruit, since they yield it not, let
   them beware.

   To those who make professions of much love to Christ, the same caution
   may be given. With the most of Christians, I am afraid, I must say that
   "the time of figs is not yet," for we are too much like the Laodicean
   Church. But you meet with some men--how much they are in love with
   Christ! How sweetly they can talk about him, but what do they do for
   him? Nothing! nothing! Their love lies just in the wind which comes out
   of their own mouths, and that is all. Now, when the Lord has a curse,
   he will deal it out on such They went beyond all others in an untimely
   declaration of a very fervent love, and now they yield him no fruit.
   "Yes," said one, "I love God so much, that I do not reckon that
   anything I have is my own. It is all the Lord's--all the Lord's, and I
   am his steward." Well, this dear good man, of course, joined the
   Church, and after a time, some mission work wanted a little help. What
   was his reply? "When I pay my seat rent, I have done all I intend to
   do." A man of wealth and means! After a little time, this same man
   found it inconvenient even to pay for his seat, and goes now to a place
   not quite so full, where he can get a seat and do nothing to support
   the ministry! If there is a special thunderbolt anywhere, it is these
   unctions hypocrites who whine about love to Christ, and bow down at the
   shrine of mammon.

   Or, take another case. You meet with others whose profession is not of
   so much love, but it is of much experience. Oh! what experience they
   have had! What deep experience! Ah! they know the humblings of heart
   and the plague of human nature! They know the depths of corruption, and
   the heights of divine fellowship, and so on. Yes, and if you go into
   the shop you find the corruption is carried on behind the counter, and
   the deceit in the day-book; if they do not know the plague of their own
   hearts, at least they are a plague to their own household. Such people
   are abhorrent to all men, and much more to God.

   Others you meet with who have a censorious tongue. What good people
   they must be; they can see the faults of other people so plainly! This
   Church is not right, and the other is not right, and yonder
   preacher--well some people think him a very good man, but they do not.
   They can see the deficiencies in the various denominations, and they
   observe that very few really carry out Scripture as it should be
   carried out. They complain of want of love, and are the very people who
   create that want. Now if you will watch these very censorious people,
   the very faults they indicate in others, they are indulging in
   themselves; and while they are seeking to find out the mote in their
   brother's eye, they have a beam in their own. These are the people who
   are indicated by this fig tree, for they ought, according to their own
   showing, taking t hem on their own ground, to be better than other
   people. If what they say be true, they are bright particular stars, and
   they ought to give special light to the world. They are such that even
   Jesus Christ himself might expect to receive fruit from them, but they
   are nothing but deceivers, with these high soarings and proud
   boastings; they are nothing after all but pretenders. Like Jezebel with
   her paint, which made her all the uglier, they would seem to be what
   they are not. As old Adam says, "They are candles with big wicks and no
   tallow, and when they go out they make a foul and nauseous smell."
   "They have summer sweating on their brow, and winter freezing in their
   hearts." You would think them the land of Goshen, but prove them the
   wilderness of sin. Let us search ourselves, lest such be the case with
   us.

   IV. And now to close, SUCH A TREE MIGHT WELL BE WITHERED. Deception is
   abhorred of God. There was the Jewish temple, there were the priests
   standing in solemn pomp, there were the abundant sacrifices of God's
   altar. But was God pleased with his temple? No, because in the temple
   you had all the leaves, you had all the externals of worship, but there
   was no true prayer, no belief in the great Lamb of God's passover, no
   truth, no righteousness, no love of men, no care for the glory of God;
   and so the temple, which had been a house of prayer, had become a den
   of thieves. You do not marvel that the temple was destroyed. You and I
   may become just like that temple. We may go on with all the externals
   of religions, nobody may miss us out of our seat at Tabernacle, nay, we
   may never miss our Christian engagements; we may be in all external
   matters more precise than we used to be, and yet for all that, we may
   have become in our hearts a den of thieves; the heart may be given to
   the world while external ceremonies are still kept up and maintained.
   Let us beware of this, for such a place cannot be long without a curse.
   It is abhorrent to God.

   Again, it is deceptive to man. Look at that temple! What do men go
   there for? To see holiness and virtue. Why tread they its hallowed
   courts? To get nearer to God. And what do they find there? Instead of
   holiness, covetousness; instead of getting nearer to God, they get into
   the midst of a mart where men are haggling about the price of doves,
   and bickering with one another about the changing of shekels. So men
   may watch to hear some seasonable word from our lips, and instead of
   that, may get evil; and as that temple was cursed for deluding men, so
   may we be, because we deceive and disappoint the wants of mankind.

   More than this, this barren fig tree committed sacrilege upon Christ,
   did it not? Might it not have exposed him to ridicule? Some might have
   said, "How goest thou to a tree, thou prophet, whereon there is no
   fruit?" A false professor exposes Christ to ridicule. As the temple of
   old dishonored God, so does a Christian when his heart is not right; he
   does dishonor to God, and makes the holy cause to be trodden under foot
   of the adversary. Such men indeed have reason to beware.

   Once more, this tree might well be cursed, because its bringing forth
   nothing but leaves was a plain evidence of its sterility. It had force
   and vitality, but it turned it to ill account, and would continue to do
   so. The curse of Christ was but a confirmation of what it already was.
   He did as good as say, "He that is unfruitful, let him be unfruitful
   still." And now, what if Christ should come into this Tabernacle this
   morning, and should look on you and on me, and see in any of us great
   profession and great pomp of leaves, and yet no fruit, what if he
   should pronounce the curse on us, what would be the effect? We should
   wither away as others have done. What mean we by this? Why, they have
   on a sudden turned to the world. We could not understand why such fair
   saints should, on a sudden, become such black devils; the fact was,
   Christ had pronounced the word, and they began to wither away. If he
   should pronounce the unmasking word on any mere professor here, and
   say, "Let no man eat fruit of thee for ever," you will go into gross
   outward sin and wither to your shame. This will take place probably on
   a sudden; and taking place, your case will be irretrievable; you never
   afterwards will be restored. The blast which shall fall upon you will
   be eternal; you will live as a lasting monument of the terrible justice
   of Christ, as the great head of the Church; you will be spared to let
   it be seen that a man outside the Church may escape with impunity in
   this life, but a man inside the Church shall have a present curse, and
   be made to stand as a tree blasted by the lightning of God for ever.
   Now, this is a heart-searching matter. It went through me yesterday
   when I thought, "Well, here am I, I have professed to be called of God
   to the ministry; I have forced myself into a leading place in God's
   Church; I have voluntarily put myself into a place where sevenfold
   damnation is my inevitable inheritance if I be not true and sincere." I
   could almost wish myself back out of the Church, or at least in the
   obscurest place in her ranks, to escape the perils and responsibilities
   of my position; and so may you, if you have not the witness of the
   Spirit in you that you are born of God--you may wish that you never
   thought of Christ, and never dreamed of taking his name upon you. If
   you have by diligence worked yourself into a high position among God's
   people; if you have mere leaves without the fruit, the more sure is the
   curse, because the greater the disappointment of the Savior. The more
   you profess, the more is expected of you; and if you do not yield it,
   the more just the condemnation when you shall be left to stand for ever
   withered by the curse of Christ. O men and brethren, let us tremble
   before the heart-searching eye of God; but let us still remember that
   grace can make us fruitful yet. The way of mercy is open still. Let us
   apply to the wounds of Christ this morning. If we have never begun, let
   us begin now. Now let us throw our arms about the Savior, and take him
   to be ours; and, having done this, let us seek divine grace, that for
   the rest of our lives we may work for God. Oh! I do hope to do more for
   God, and I hope you will. O Holy Spirit, work in us mightily, for in
   thee is our fruit found! Amen.

                              The Sinner's Friend

   A Sermon

   (No. 556)

   By the

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "A friend of publicans and sinners."--Matthew 11:19.

   MANY A TRUE WORD is spoken in jest, and many a tribute to virtue has
   been unwittingly paid by the sinister lips of malice. The enemies of
   our Lord Jesus Christ thought to brand him with infamy, hold him up to
   derision, and hand his name down to everlasting scorn, as "a friend of
   publicans and sinners." Short-sighted mortals! Their scandal published
   his reputation. To this day the Savior is adored by the title which was
   minted as a slur. It was designed to be a stigma, that every good man
   would shudder at and shrink from; it has proved to be a fascination
   which wins the heart, and enchants the soul of all the godly. Saints in
   heaven, and saints on earth delight to sing of him thus--

   "Savior of sinners they proclaim,

   Sinners of whom the chief I am."

   What the invidious Jews said in bitter spleen, has been turned by the
   Holy Spirit to the most gracious account. Where they poured out vials
   of hate, odours of sacred incense arise. Troubled consciences have
   found a sweet balm in the very sound. Jesus, "the friend of publicans
   and sinners," has proved himself friendly to them, and they have become
   friends with him; so completely has he justified the very name which
   his enemies gave him in ribald affront.

   We shall take this title of Jesus to-night as an order of distinction
   which sets forth his excellency, and as God helps us, we shall try to
   exalt his name and proclaim his fame, while we attempt to explain how
   he was the friend of sinners; and how he shows that he is still the
   same.

   I. OUR LORD PROVED HIMSELF IN HIS OWN TIME TO BE THE FRIEND OF SINNERS.

   What better proof could he give of it than coming from the majesty of
   his Father's house to the meanness of Bethlehem's manger? What better
   proof could he give than leaving the society of cherubim and seraphim,
   to lie in the manger where the horned oxen fed, and to become the
   associate of fallen men? The incarnation of the Savior in the very form
   of sinners, taking upon himself the flesh of sinners, being born of a
   sinner, having a sinner for his reputed father--his very being a man,
   which is tantamount to being in the same form with sinners--surely this
   were enough to prove that he is the sinner's friend.

   When you take up the roll of his earthly lineage and begin to read it
   through, you will be struck with the fact that there are but few women
   mentioned in it; and yet three out of those mentioned were harlots, so
   that even in his lineage there was the taint of sin, and a sinner' s
   blood would have run in his veins if he had been the true son of
   Joseph; but inasmuch as he was begotten by the Holy Ghost, who
   overshadowed the Virgin, in him was no sin; yet his reputed pedigree
   ran through the veins of sinners. Tamar, and Rahab, and Bath-sheba are
   three names which bring to remembrance deeds of shame, and yet these
   stand in the records as the ancestors of the Son of Mary, the sinner's
   friend!

   As soon as Jesus Christ, being born in the likeness of sinful flesh,
   has come to years of maturity, and has commenced his real life-work, he
   at once discloses his friendship for sinners by associating with them.
   You do not find him standing at a distance, issuing his mandates and
   his orders to sinners to make themselves better, but you find him
   coming among them like a good workman who stands over his work; he
   takes his place where the sin and the iniquity are, and he personally
   comes to deal with it. He does not write out a prescription and send by
   another hand his medicines with which to heal the sickness of sin, but
   he comes right into the lazar-house, touches the wounded, looks at the
   sick; and there is healing in the touch; there is life in the look. The
   great Physician took upon himself our sicknesses and bare our
   infirmities, and so proved himself to be really the sinner's friend.
   Some people appear to like to have a philanthropic love towards the
   fallen, but yet they would not touch them with a pair of tongs. They
   would lift them up if they could, but it must be by some
   machinery--some sort of contrivance by which they would not degrade
   themselves or contaminate their own hands. Not so the Savior. Up to the
   very elbow he seems to thrust that gracious arm of his into the mire,
   to pull up the lost one out of the horrible pit and out of the miry
   clay. He takes himself the mattock and the spade, and goes to work in
   the great quarry that he may get out the rough stones which afterwards
   he will himself polish with his own bitter tears and bloody sweat, that
   he may make them fit to shine for ever in the glorious temple of the
   Lord his God. He comes himself into direct, personal contact with sin,
   without being contaminated with it. He comes as close to it as a man
   can come. He eats and drinks with sinners. He sits at the Pharisee's
   table one day, and does not rise because there is a crowd of people no
   better than they should be coming near him. Another day he goes to the
   publican's house, and the publican had, no doubt, been a great
   extortioner in his time; but Jesus sits there, and that day does
   salvation come to that publican's house. Beloved, this is a sweet trait
   about Christ, and proves how real and how true was his love, that he
   made his associations with sinners, and did not shun even the chief of
   them.

   Nay, he not only came among them, but he was always seeking their good
   by his ministry. If there was anywhere a sinner, a lost sheep of the
   house of Israel, Christ was after that sinner. Never such an
   indefatigable shepherd; he sought that which was lost till he found it.
   One of his earliest works of mercy we will tell you of in brief. He was
   once on a journey, and Samaria was a little out of his way; but there
   lived in a city of that country a woman--ah! the less said of her the
   better. She had had five husbands, and he whom she then had was not her
   husband, nor were any of the others either. She was a disgrace to that
   city of Samaria. But Jesus, who has a keen eye for sinners, and a heart
   which beats high for them, means to save that woman, and he must and he
   will have her. Being weary, he sits down on a well to rest. A special
   providence brings the woman to the well. The conventionalities of
   society forbid him to talk with her. But he breaks through the narrow
   bigotry of caste. A Samaritan by birth, he cares not for that; but will
   that most holy being condescend to have familiar conversation with
   her--a dishonor to her sex? He will. His disciples may marvel when they
   come back and find him talking with her, but he will do it. He begins
   to open up the Word of life to her understanding, and that woman
   becomes the first Christian missionary we ever hear of, for she ran
   back to the city, leaving her water-pot, and crying, "Come, see a man
   which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?" And
   they came and believed; and there was great joy in that city of
   Samaria. You know, too, that there was another sinner. He was a bad
   fellow--I fear him. He had been constantly grinding the faces of the
   poor, and getting more out of them by way of taxation than he should
   have done; but the little man had the bump of curiosity, and he must
   needs see the preacher, and the preacher must needs love him; for I say
   there was a wonderful attraction in Jesus to a sinner. That sinner's
   heart was like a piece of iron: Christ's heart was like a loadstone;
   and wherever there was a sinner the loadstone began to feel it, and
   soon the sinner began to feel the loadstone too. "Azccheus," said
   Christ, "make haste, and come down; for to-day I must abide at thy
   house;" and down comes the sinner, and salvation has come to his house
   at that hour, Oh! Christ never seemed to preach so sweetly as when he
   was preaching a sinner's sermon. I would have loved to have seen that
   dear face of his when he cried, "Come unto me all ye that labor and are
   heavy laden, and I will give you rest;" or, better still, to have seen
   his eyes running with whole showers of tears when he said, "O
   Jerusalem, Jerusalem . . . how often would I have gathered thy children
   together, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would
   not even!" or to have heard him preach those three great sermons upon
   sinners when he described the woman as sweeping the house and taking
   away the dust, that she might find the lost piece of her money; and the
   shepherd going from hill to hill after the wandering sheep; and the
   father running to welcome that rag-clad prodigal; kissing him with the
   kisses of love, clothing him with the best robe, and inviting him into
   the feast, while they did dance and make merry because the lost was
   found, and he who was dead was alive again. Why, he was the mightiest
   of preachers for sinners, beyond a doubt, Oh! how he loved them! Never
   mind the Pharisees: he has thunderbolts for them. "Woe unto you,
   Scribes and Pharisees!" But when publicans and harlots come, he always
   has the gate of mercy ajar for them. For them he always has some tender
   word, some loving saying, such as this--"Him that cometh unto me, I
   will in no wise cast out." "All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be
   forgiven unto men;" or such like words of tender wooing. The very chief
   of sinners was thus drawn into the circle of his disciples.

   And you know, dear friends, he did not prove his love merely by
   preaching to them, and living with them, and by his patience in
   enduring their contradiction against himself, and all their evil words
   and deeds, but he proved it by his prayers too. He used his mighty
   influence with the Father in their behalf. He took their polluted names
   on his holy lips; he was not ashamed to call them brethren. Their cause
   became his own, and in their interest his pulse throbbed. How many
   times on the cold mountains he kept his heart warm with love to them!
   How often the sweat rolled down his face when he was in an agony of
   spirit for them I cannot tell you. This much I do know, that on that
   self-same night when he sweat as it were great drops of blood falling
   down to the ground, he prayed this prayer--after having prayed for his
   saints, he went on to say--"Neither pray I for these alone, but for
   them also which shall believe on me through their word." Here, truly,
   the heart of the Savior was bubbling up and welling over towards
   sinners. And you never can forget that almost his last words were,
   "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do." Though wilfully
   and wickedly they pierced his hands and his feet, yet were there no
   angry words, but only that short, loving, hearty prayer--"Father,
   forgive them; for they know not what they do." Ah! friends, if there
   ever was a man who was a friend to others, Jesus was a friend to
   sinners his whole life through.

   This, however, is but little. As for the river of the Savior's love to
   sinners, I have only brought you to its banks. You have but stood on
   the bank and dipped your feet in the flood; but now prepare to swim. So
   fond was he of sinners that he made his grave with the wicked. He was
   numbered with the transgressors. God's fiery sword was drawn to smite a
   world of sinners down to hell. It must fall on those sinners. But
   Christ loves them. His prayers stay the arm of God a little while, but
   still the sword must fall in due time. What is to be done? By what
   means can they be rescued? Swifter than the lightning's flash I see
   that sword descending. But what is that in vision I behold? It
   falls--but where? Not on the neck of sinners; it is not their neck
   which is broken by its cruel edge; it is not their heart which bleeds
   beneath its awful force. No; the "friend of sinners" has put himself
   into the sinner's place! and then, as if he had been the sinner, though
   in him was no sin, he suffers, bleeds, and dies--no common
   suffering--no ordinary bleeding--no death such as mortals know. It was
   a death in which the second death was comprehended; a bleeding in which
   the very veins of God were emptied. The God-man divinely suffered. I
   know not how else to express the suffering. It was a more than mortal
   agony, for the divine strengthened the human, and the man was made vast
   and mighty to endure through his being a God. Being God and man he
   endured more than ten thousand millions of men all put together could
   have suffered. He endured, indeed, the hells of all for whom he died,
   the torments, or the equivalent for the torments, which all of them
   ought to have suffered--the eternal wrath of God condensed and put into
   a cup, too bitter for mortal tongue to know, and then drained to its
   utmost dregs by the loving lips of Jesus. Beloved, this was love.
   "Herein is love, that while we were yet sinners, in due time Christ
   died for the ungodly." "Greater love hath no man than this, that he lay
   down his life for his friends." This Christ has done, and he is,
   therefore demonstrated to be the friend of sinners.

   But the trial is over; the struggle is passed; the Savior is dead and
   buried; he rises again, and after he has spent forty days on earth--in
   that forty days proving still his love for sinners--he rose again for
   their justification; I see him ascending up on high. Angels attend him
   as the clouds receive him.

   "They bring his chariot from on high,

   To bear him to his throne;

   Clap their triumphant wings and cry,

   'The glorious work is done.'"

   What pomp! What a procession! What splendor! He will forget his poor
   friends the sinners now, will he not? Not he! I think I hear the song,
   "Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting
   doors, that the King of Glory may come in." The bars of massy light are
   all unloosed; the pearly gates are all wide open flung; and as he
   passes through, mark you, the highest joy which swells his soul is that
   he has opened those gates, not for himself, for they were never shut on
   him, but that he has opened them for sinners. It was for this, indeed,
   he died; and it is for this that he ascends on high, that he may "open
   the kingdom of heaven for all believers." See him as he rides through
   heaven's streets! "Thou hast ascended up on high; thou hast led
   captivity captive; thou hast received gifts of men." Ah! but hear the
   refrain, for this is the sweetest note of all the hymn, "Yea, for the
   rebellious also--yea, for the rebellious also, that the Lord God might
   dwell among them." The scattered gifts of his coronation, the lavish
   bounties of his ascension, are still for sinners. He is exalted on
   high--for what? To give repentance and remission of sins. He still
   wears upon his breastplate the names of sinners; upon his hands and
   upon his heart does he still bear the remembrance of those sinners; and
   every day for the sinner's sake he doth not hold his peace, and for the
   sinner's sake he doth not rest, but cries unto God until every sinner
   shall be brought safely home. Every sinner who believeth, every sinner
   who was given to him, every sinner whom he bought with blood--he will
   not rest, I say, till all such are gathered to be the jewels of his
   crown, world without end.

   Methinks we cannot say more; and 1 think you will say we could not have
   said less concerning the way in which the Savior proved himself to be
   the sinner's friend. If there are any of you who dare to doubt him
   after this, I know not what further to advance. If there can be one who
   has proved himself your friend, surely Jesus did it, and he is willing
   to receive you now. What he has done he still continues to do. O that
   you might have grace to perceive that Jesus is the lover of your soul,
   that you might find the blessedness which all these tokens of
   friendship, of which we have been speaking, have brought for believing
   sinners.

   II. While we change the subject a little, we shall still keep to the
   text, and notice WHAT CHRIST IS DOING NOW FOR SINNERS.

   There is a deep principle involved here--a principle the Pharisee of
   old could not understand, and the cold heart of humanity is slow to
   embrace it to-day. I have two explanations to offer of the way in which
   Jesus personally discovers himself to be the friend of sinners, and I
   will just mention these before I come to the application of the subject
   I intend. Once upon a time a woman was brought to Jesus by the Scribes
   and Pharisees: she was an adulteress, she had been taken in the very
   act. They tell "the sinners friend" what sentence Moses would pronounce
   in such a case, and they ask him, how sayest thou? This they said
   tempting him. They were not much concerned about the unhappy creature;
   the accusation they were intent to lay was against the Man of Nazareth.
   You know how he disposed of the case, and put her accusers out of
   countenance. He did not bring the sinner up before the magistrate; nay,
   he would not act the judge's part, and pronounce sentence, rather would
   he act the neighbor's part; he acquitted himself as a friend. There is
   a proverb among a certain class of hard-dealing tradesmen, "We know no
   friendship in business;" and full well they carry it out, while they
   grind the faces of the poor without pity, and strive to over-reach one
   another without fairness. And there was in like manner no friendship,
   no mercy whatever, among those gentlemen of the long robe.
   Righteousness, to their idea, stood in exacting justice with rigid
   severity; and as for wickedness, it was only shameful when it was found
   out. She who was taken in the act must be stoned. They who had done it
   secretly must prosecute. The real friendship of Jesus appears in his
   singling out the object of pity; and where they accused him of winking
   at crime and harbouring the criminal, he was truly laying the axe at
   the root of the tree, and sheltering the victims while he upbraided the
   arrogant rulers, whose secret vices were the genuine cause of the
   wretchedness which had fallen upon the dregs of the nation. I commend
   this thought to your consideration. When it is said of him, he is a
   "friend of pubhicans and sinners," it was implied that he was not a
   friend of Scribes and Pharisees. Yet again, I want you to notice that
   the office which Christ came to fulfill towards sinners was that of
   pure, unmingled friendship. Let us give you an illustration. There is
   an awful story abroad: a murder has been committed; and the poor wretch
   who committed it has cut his own throat. The policeman and the surgeon
   are quickly on the spot. The one comes there in the interest of law,
   the other attends in the interest of humanity. Says the officer of
   police, "Man, you are my prisoner;" says the doctor, "My dear fellow,
   you are my patient." And now he lays a delicate hand upon the wound, he
   stanches the blood, applies soft liniments, binds it up with plasters,
   and, bending down his ear, listens to the man's breathing: taking hold
   of his hand, he feels his pulse: gently raising his head, he
   administers to him some wine or stimulant, takes him to the hospital,
   gives the nurse instructions to watch him, and orders that he shall be
   given nutritious diet as he is able to bear it. Day after day he still
   visits him, and uses all his skill and all his diligence to heal the
   man's Wounds. Is that the way to deal with criminals? Certainly it is
   not the manner in which the police deal. Their business is to find out
   all the traces and evidences of his guilt. But the medical attendant is
   not concerned with the man as an evil doer, but as a sufferer. So is it
   with the sinner. Moses is the officer of justice who comes to arrest
   him. Christ is the good Physician who comes to heal him; he says, "O
   Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself but in me is thy help." He deals
   with the disease, with the wounds, with the sufferings of sinners. He
   is therefore their friend. Of course the parallel will only go a little
   way. In the instance of the murderer, the surgeon would hand his
   patient over to the officers as soon as his wound was recovered; but in
   the conduct of our Savior he redeems the soul from under the law, and
   delivers it from the penalty of sin, as well as restores it from the
   self-inflicted injuries. But oh! if I could but show thee that Christ
   treats the sinner with pity, rather than with indignation; that the Son
   of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them; that his
   visit to our world was mediatoral, not to condemn the world, but to
   give his life a ransom for many; surely, then, thou wouldst see reason
   enough why the sinner should look to him as a friend indeed.

   Ah! then; I would go further. I would entreat thee to make the case
   thine own. Thou art a sinner; can I not convince thee that he is thy
   friend?

   You were sick the other day. The physician looked very grave, and
   whispered something to your wife. She did not tell you what it was, but
   your own life trembled in the scale, and it is a wonder you are here
   to-night. Shall I tell you why you are here? Do you see that tree
   yonder? It has been standing in its place for many years, but it has
   never yielded any fruit, and several times the master of the garden has
   said, "Cut it down." The other day the woodman came with his axe; he
   felt its edge, it was sharp and keen enough, and he began to cut, and
   the chips were flying, and he made a deep gash. But the gardener came
   by, one who had watched over the tree, and had hope of it even yet, and
   he said, "Spare it--spare it yet a little longer; the wound thou hast
   made may heal; and I will dig about it, and dung it, and if it bring
   forth fruit well; spare it another year, and if not then cut it down."
   That tree is yourself. The woodman is Death. That chipping at the trunk
   of the tree was your sickness. Jesus is he who spared you. You had not
   been here to-night--you had been there in hell among damned spirits,
   howling in unutterable woe, if it had not been that the friend of
   sinners had spared your life.

   And where are you to-night? Perhaps, my hearers, you are in an unusual
   place for you. Your Sunday evenings are not often spent in the house of
   God. There are other places which know you, but your seat there is
   empty to-night. There has been much persuasion to bring you here, and
   it may be that you have come against your will; but some friend has
   asked you to conduct him to the spot, and here you are. Do you know why
   you are here? It is a friendly providence, managed by the sinner's
   friend which has brought you here, that you may hear the sound of
   mercy, and have a loving invitation tendered to you. Be grateful to the
   Savior that he has brought you to the gospel-pool. May you--O, may you
   this night be made to step in and be washed from sin! But it is kind of
   him, and proves how true a friend he is of sinners, that he has brought
   you here. I will leave you now where you are, and I will tell you how
   he has dealt with other sinners, for mayhap this may lead you to ask
   him to deal the same with you.

   I know a sinner--while I live I must know him. Full well do I remember
   him when he was hard of heart and an enemy to God by a multitude of
   wicked works. But this friend of sinners loved him; and passing by one
   day, he looked right into his soul with such a look, that his hard
   heart began to break. There were deep throes as though a birth of a
   divine sort were coming on. There was an agony, and there was a grief
   unutterable; and that poor soul did not think it kind of Jesus; but,
   indeed, it was kindness too intense ever fully to estimate, for there
   is no saving a soul except by making it feel its need of being saved.
   There must be in the work of grace an emptying and a pulling down
   before there can be a filling and a building up. That soul knew no
   peace for many a year, and the sole of its foot had no rest; but one
   day

   "I heard the voice of Jesus say,

   Come unto me and rest;

   Lay down, thou weary one, lay down,

   Thy head upon my breast.

   I came to Jesus as I was,

   Weary, and worn, and sad,

   I found in him a resting-place,

   And he has made me glad!

   I heard the voice of Jesus say,

   Behold, I freely give

   The living water, thirsty one,

   Stoop down, and drink, and live.

   I came to Jesus and I drank

   Of that life-giving stream;

   My thirst was quench'd, my soul revived,

   And now I live in him.

   I heard the voice of Jesus say,

   I am this dark world's light,

   Look unto me, thy morn shall rise,

   And all thy days be bright.

   I look'd to Jesus and I found

   In him my star, my sun

   And in that light of light I'll walk,

   Till travelling days are done."

   Ay, said I, Christ is the friend of sinners! So say I, and so will I
   say while this poor lisping stammering tongue can articulate a sound.
   And methinks God had a design of abundant mercy when he saved my soul.
   I had not then believed it, though a mother's loving accents might have
   whispered it in my ears. But he seems to remind me of it over and over
   again, till love and terror mingle in my breast, saying, "Woe is me if
   I preach not the gospel." O my blessed Master, thou dost trust my lips
   when thou dost bear witness to my heart. Thou givest charge to my
   tongue when thou constrained my soul. "Am I a chosen vessel?" It is to
   bear his name to sinners. As a full bottle seeks vent, so must my
   testimony pant for utterance. O sinner, if thou trustest him, he will
   be such a friend to thee; and if thou hast now a broken heart and a
   contrite spirit, these are his work; and it is a proof of his great
   love to thee if he has made thee to hunger and thirst after him.

   Let me impress upon you that Jesus is the friend of the friendless. She
   who had spent all her money on physicians without getting relief,
   obtained a cure gratis when she came to him. He who bath "nothing to
   pay" gets all his debts cancelled by this friend. And he who was ready
   to perish with hunger, finds not only a passing meal, but a constant
   supply at his hands.

   We know of a place in England still existing, where there is a dole of
   bread served to every passer-by who chooses to ask for it. Whoever he
   may be he has but to knock at the door of St. Cross Hospital, and there
   is the dole of bread for him. Jesus Christ so loveth sinners that he
   has built a St. Cross Hospital, so that, whenever a sinner is hungry,
   he has but to knock and have his wants supplied. Nay, he has done
   better; he has attached to this hospital of the cross a bath; and
   whenever a soul is black and filthy it has but to go there and be
   washed. The fountain is always full, always efficacious. There is no
   sinner who ever went into it and found it, could not wash away his
   stains. Sins which were scarlet and crimson have all disappeared, and
   the sinner has been whiter than snow. As if this were not enough, there
   is attached to this hospital of the cross a wardrobe, and a sinner,
   making application simply as a sinner, with nothing in his hand, but
   being just empty and naked, he may come and be clothed from head to
   foot. And if he wishes to be a soldier, he may not merely have an under
   garment, but he may have armor which shall cover him from the sole of
   his foot to the crown of his head. Nay, if he wants a sword he shall
   have that given to him, and a shield too. There is nothing that his
   heart can desire that is good for him which he shall not receive. He
   shall have spending-money so long as he lives, and he shall have an
   eternal heritage of glorious treasure when he enters into the joy of
   his Lord.

   Beloved, I cannot tell you all that Christ has done for sinners, but
   this I know, that if he meets with you to-night, and becomes your
   friend, he will stand by you to the last. He will go home with you
   to-night. No matter how many pairs of stairs you have to go up, Jesus
   will go with you. No matter if there be no chair to sit down on, he
   will not disdain you. You shall be hard at work to-morrow, but as you
   wipe the sweat from your brow he shall stand by you. You will, perhaps,
   be despised for his sake, but he will not forsake you. You will,
   perhaps, have days of sickness, but he will come and make your bed in
   your sickness for you. You will, perhaps, be poor, but your bread shal
   be given you, and your water shall be sure, for he will provide for
   you. You will vex him much and grieve his Spirit. You will often doubt
   him--you will go after other lovers. You will provoke him to jealousy,
   but he will never cease to love you. You will, perhaps, grow cold to
   him, and even forget his dear name for a time, but he will never forget
   you. You may, perhaps, dishononr his cross, and damage his fair fame
   among the sons of men, but he will never cease to love you; nay, he
   will never love you less--he cannot love you more. This night he doth
   espouse himself unto you. Faith shall be the wedding-ring which he will
   put upon your finger. He plights his troth to you,

   "Though you should him ofttimes forget

   His lovingkindness fast is set."

   His heart shall be so true to you that he will never leave you nor
   forsake you. You will come to die soon, but the friend of sinners, who
   loved you as a sinner and would not cast you off when your sinnership
   kept breaking up, will still he with you when you come to the sinner's
   doom, which is to die. I see you going down the shelving banks of
   Jordan, but the sinner's friend goes with you. Ah! dear heart, he will
   put his arm beneath you, and bid you fear not; and when in the thick
   shades of that grim night you expect to see a fearful visage--the grim
   face of Death--you shall see instead thereof, you shall see his sweet
   and smiling face, bright as an evening star, by your soul, and you
   shall hear him say, "Fear not, I am with thee; be not dismayed; I am
   thy God." You will land in the world of spirits by-and-by; but will the
   sinner's friend forsake you then? No; he will be pleased to own you; he
   will meet you on the other side the Jordan, and he will say, "Come, my
   beloved, I have loved thee with an everlasting love, and have bought
   thee, though thou wast a sinner vile, and now I am not ashamed to
   confess thee before my holy angels; nay, come with me, and I will take
   thee to my Father's face, and will confess thee there." And when the
   day shall come in which the world shall be judged, he will be thy
   friend then. Thou shalt sit on the bench with him. At the right hand of
   the Judge shalt thou stand, accepted in him who was thine Advocate, and
   who is now thy Judge, to acquit thee. And when the splendours of the
   millennium shall come, thou shalt partake of them; and when the end
   shall be, and the world shall be rolled up like a worn-out vesture, and
   these arching skies shall have passed away like a forgotten dream; when
   eternity, with its deep-sounding waves shall break upon the mocks of
   time and sweep them away for ever--then, on that sea of glass mingled
   with fire, thou shalt stand with Christ, thy friend still, owning thee
   notwithstanding all thy misbehaviour in the world which has gone, and
   loving thee now, loving thee on as long as eternity shall last. Oh!
   what a friend is Christ to sinners, to sinners!

   Now do recollect, that we have been talking about sinners; there is a
   notion abroad that Jesus Christ came into the world to save respectable
   people, and that he will save decent sort of folks; that those of you
   who go regularly to a place of worship, and are good sort of people,
   will be saved. Now Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners;
   and who does that mean? Well, it includes some of us who have not been
   permitted to go into outward sin; but it also includes within its deep,
   broad compass those who have gone to the utmost extent of iniquity.

   Talk of sinners! Walk the streets by moonlight, if you dare, and you
   will see sinners then. Watch when the night is dark, and the wind is
   howling, and the picklock is grating in the door, and you will see
   sinners then. Go to you jail, and walk through the wards, and see the
   men with heavy, over-hanging brows, men whom you would not like to meet
   out at night, and there are sinners there. Go to the Reformatories, and
   see those who have betrayed an early and a juvenile depravity, and you
   will see sinners there. Go across the seas to the place where a man
   will gnaw a bone upon which is reeking human flesh, and there is a
   sinner there. Go you where you will, and ransack earth to find sinners,
   for they are common enough; you may find them in every lane and street,
   of every city and town, and village and hamlet. It is for such that
   Jesus died. If you will select me the grossest specimen of humanity, if
   he be but born of woman, I will have hope of him yet, because the
   gospel of Christ is come to sinners, and Jesus Christ is come to seek
   and to save sinners. Electing love has selected some of the worst to be
   made the best. Redeeming love has bought, specially bought, many of the
   worst to be the reward of the Savior's passion. Effectual grace calls
   out and compels to come in many of the vilest of the vile; and it is
   therefore that I have tried to-night to preach my Master's love to
   sinners.

   Oh! by that love, looking out of those eyes in tears; oh! by that love,
   streaming from those wounds flowing with blood; by that faithful love,
   that strong love, that pure, disinterested, and abiding love; oh! by
   the heart and by the bowels of the Savior's compassion, I do conjure
   you turn not away as though it were nothing to you; but believe on him
   and you shall be saved. Trust your souls with him and he will bring you
   to his Father's right hand in glory everlasting.

   May God give us a blessing for Jesus' sake. Amen.

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, February 28th, 1864, by the

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "From me is thy fruit found."--Hosea 14:8.

   THE text has a double significance. It may indicate the fruit upon
   which we feed, or the fruit which we are enabled to produce. If it
   shall mean the first, there is mach of comfort in it. The Lord has
   compared himself, in his condescending mercy, to a green fir tree in
   the sentence which precedes the text. The fir tree in the East yields a
   most goodly shade. Neither the burning heat of the sun, nor the drops
   of pouring rain can.pass through the dense foliage, and therefore it
   affords a welcome shelter to the traveler. But shade is not enough for
   a man; he requires food, and the fir tree fails in that respect, for it
   yields no repast for the hungry. To complete the picture, therefore,
   when the Lord deigns to compare himself to a green fir tree, he adds,
   "From me is thy fruit found." Our gracious God is like a fir tree for
   shade, but like the apple tree among the trees of the wood for fruit.
   We sit under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit is sweet unto
   our taste. Living souls must have food to feed upon, or however well
   housed, they would be comparable to the king of Israel in the besieged
   city of Samaria. He sat in his palace of ivory, he wore his mantle of
   purple, and placed the crown of gold upon his head; but what availed
   his splendor, when neither barn-floor nor winepress could relieve his
   hunger? In vain all other blessings if the soul received no nourishment
   from on high; Jesus must not only be our life, but the bread of heaven
   by which that life is sustained. Glory be to his name! he is all in all
   to his people: we may gather fruit from him which shall satisfy the
   cravings of the soul.

   According to Master Trapp, some read this passage, "In me is thy fruit
   ready." Certain it is that at all times, whenever we approach to God,
   we shall find in him a ready supply for every lack. The best of trees
   have fruit on them only at appointed seasons. Who is so unreasonable as
   to look for fruit upon the peach or the plum at this season of the
   year? No drooping boughs beckon us to partake of their ripening crops,
   for Winter's cold still nips the buds. But our God hath fruit at all
   times: the tree of life yieldeth its fruit every month; nay, every day
   and every hour, for he is "a very present help in time of trouble."

   Another translator reads the passage, "In me thy fruit is enough."
   Whatever may be the accuracy of the translation, the sentiment itself
   is most correct. In God there is enough for all his people; and well
   there may be, since in him there is infinity. "I have enough, my
   brother," said Esau when he met Jacob: "I have all things," said Jacob
   in reply. None but the believer can say, "I have all things;" and
   therefore only he can be sure of having enough. Ishmael had his bottle
   of water, and went away into the wilderness; but it is written, that
   Isaac abode by the well: how happy is the soul which bath learned how
   to live by the well of his faithful God! for the water will be spent in
   the bottle, but the water will never be spent in the well. Christian,
   remember the all sufficiency of thy God! Let that ancient name, "El
   Shaddai"--God all-sufficient, sound like music in thine ear--as some
   translate it, "The many-breasted God," yielding from himself the
   sustenance of all his creatures.

   As we find the text translated, we have it, "From me is thy fruit
   found;" but the particle from does not mean apart from, but out of me;
   and to prevent misunderstanding, I shall not err if I read it in, for
   this is the force of the word in this place. The text speaks of fruit
   being found, implying perhaps, that we must look for it--not because
   there is little, or here and there a cluster, like the grape-gleanings
   of Abi-ezer; but because the Lord will be enquired of by the house of
   Israel, and would exercise our faith by making us search for the needed
   benefit. It is of essential service to us to make us seek, and hence we
   have the promise of finding to excite our diligence. Christian, look up
   longingly! Is thy spirit hungering? Look up to thy God now with intense
   desire; come before him with earnest, vehement pleadings, and thou
   shalt find in thy God whatsoever thy heart desireth.

   Mark that little word "thy." As if the Lord had said, "It is thine
   already; I have freely given it; it is thy fruit. I bear it, but I bear
   it for thee; every golden apple, every luscious cluster, I will bestow
   on thee. Thou canst not ask me for anything which I have not given
   thee. For behold, 1 have given thee my Son, and in him dwelleth all the
   fullness of the Godhead bodily.'" Believer, hast thou not learned the
   sweet logic of the beloved disciple, "He that spared not his own Son,
   but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely
   give us all things?" In the eternal covenant, God has made over--not
   only all created things--but himself unto his people. "I will be their
   God, and they shall be my people." "God, even our God," saith the
   Psalmist. Is not that a delightful expression, "Even our own God?" And
   so, as God is your own, his fruit is your own. Every outgoing of power,
   every outflow of love is yours already. "In him is thy fruit found."
   Surely this word "thy" is as a little golden cup filled with a rare
   cordial; he who drinketh of it shall forget his misery, and remember
   his poverty no more. Let us not fail then, dearly beloved, to receive
   boldly that which is our own by covenant engagement and faithful
   promise. What dost thou want this morning? Surely out of the "twelve
   manner of fruits," there shall be something which will suit thy
   necessities; stand not back through shame or fear, but come boldly to
   the throne of the heavenly grace.

   Thus much for the first sense of the text; but we do not intend to use
   the words in that signification this morning. We think that,
   understanding the text the other way--"From me is that fruit found
   which grace produces in thee," it will be a very fitting sequel to the
   sermon of last Sabbath morning. You will recollect we spoke upon the
   withering of the fig tree which mocked the Savior with its leaves, but
   yielded him no fruit. There may be some who were alarmed under that
   sermon, and even believers who were shaken by it; such anxieties will
   do none of us any hurt, especially if they lead us to pant after
   fruitfulness. Our text, following upon the other, will direct earnest
   seekers where to find fruit. There are three sorts of preachers, all
   useful in their way, the doctrinal, the experimental, and the
   practical; we will try to blend the three this morning, and so handle
   the words doctrinally, experimentally, and practically.

   I. First. THE DOCTRINE OF THE TEXT. The doctrine of the text is
   twofold. First, that the believer's fruit is his own--it is called "thy
   fruit;" secondly, that though it is the believer's own, yet it proceeds
   entirely from his God.

   1. The first doctrine is that true fruit is a believer's own. You will
   think this a very trite remark, but it is one which needs to be made in
   these days, for there are certain persons who talk of man as if he were
   not a thinking, intelligent, free agent. They forget his will,
   judgment, reason, and affections: they leave out of their consideration
   everything in fact which constitutes the man, and then speak of the
   operations of grace as though they were manual works upon wood or
   stone. For aught I can see, according to their way of talking, the
   grace of God might just as well have produced holiness in monkeys as in
   men, for men are generally represented as merely passive existences to
   be moved by them to gratitude, or repentance, or faith, as horses are
   groomed in a stable or led out to be exercised. Be it never forgotten
   that our God deals with men as intelligent beings, having will and
   reason and all the other powers which make man a responsible creature;
   he does not ignore our manhood when he converts us by his grace. He
   uses means fitted for our constitution as men, "I drew them with the
   cords of love, with the bands of a man."

   Good works are a believer's own. It were an ill thing for him if they
   were not; to what could we compare him but to those dead sticks with
   fruits tied on them, which women sell to little children? a sorry
   picture for a branch of Christ's vine. The believer produces fruit from
   his own inner self when grace has renewed him; and if his holiness were
   not really the outgrowth of his new heart and his renewed nature, it
   would be no sign of spiritual life. It is not fruit tied on us, but
   fruit growing out of us which proveth us to be engrafted into Christ.

   True fruit is the believer's own because he wills through divine grace
   to do good works. If I performed what looked like a good work against
   my will, I do not see how it could be truly a good work as far as the
   doer is concerned. If a man could be compelled to virtue while his
   heart staggered away to sin, would he not be really transgressing?
   There is a gracious willingness towards the right thing bestowed upon
   us by the Holy Spirit. Nay, there is not only a will to holiness, but a
   desire after it. The true Christian longs after holiness and
   usefulness; he hungers and thirsts to do the will of his Father who is
   in heaven. Like his Lord in some measure, it is to him his meat and his
   drink to do the will of him who sent him. He can say, "The zeal of
   thine house hath eaten me up." He is constrained, but mark, it is not a
   physical constraint, for "the love of Christ constraineth us." So you
   see, beloved, good works are a believer's own because he is willing to
   do them and desires to perform them.

   They are his own, again, because he actually does them. The Holy Ghost
   does not repent, nor feed the hungry, nor clothe the naked, nor preach
   the gospel. He gives us grace to do all these, but we ourselves do
   them. If the poor be fed, it must be by these hands; if souls are
   edified, it must be by these lips; we do not fold our arms, and shut
   our mouths, and then bring forth fruit unto God. We do not find
   ourselves taken up by the hair of our head as the prophet Habakkuk was
   said to have been, according to the Apocrypha, and so carried away
   whether we will or no, to perform a deed of charity. All glory be to
   the Holy Spirit, but he is not glorified by making him appear to be a
   physical force instead of the great spiritual Worker. We do, my
   brethren, bring forth fruit which is properly our own when we consider
   ways of usefulness, meditate methods of working, plan designs of good,
   act out deeds of mercy, persevere in labor, and continue in service
   before God.

   I will tell you why I am absolutely sure a believer's works are his
   own, namely, because he grieves over them. The best works he ever
   performs he feels are his own, because they are imperfect. If there is
   anything good in them, he ascribes it wholly to the fact that they
   proceeded from God; but, inasmuch as there is something imperfect in
   them, he is obliged to say, "Ah! yes, this is my fruit. If it had been
   God's fruit independent of me, it would have been perfect, but inasmuch
   as it is imperfect, I am compelled to see that I had a hand in it. The
   stream was clear enough as it came from the fountain, but flowing
   through the wooden spout of my nature, it is become in some measure
   defiled, and so far at least is mine."

   Dear friends, the whole analogy of fruitbearing must show to you that
   the Christian does bring forth fruit unto God, real fruit from his
   inner self; and if any of you think that you are going to attain to
   holiness by simply being passive, you are wonderfully mistaken. If you
   imagine you will be a pilgrim by sitting down at the wicket-gate, or be
   carried in a sedan-chair to glory, you will find yourselves left
   behind. No, we must fight if we would win; we must travel if we would
   reach the Celestial City; we must wrestle, and fight, and pray. The
   Word of God does say "It is God that worketh in us to will and to do of
   his own good pleasure," but it does not stop there, it bids us for this
   very reason "Work out our own salvation with fear and trembling." The
   passive first, but then the active. We must lie as dead at Jehovah's
   feet to be quickened, but being quickened, what then? Why then we walk
   in holiness and in the fear of God. We are first of all made trees of
   the Lord's right-hand planting, and we receive grace from him, and then
   through his grace, we ourselves do really bring forth fruit. The truth
   is clear enough, prove by your energetic strivings that you under stand
   it.

   2. The pith of the doctrine lieth here, that all a believer's fruit
   proceeds from his God, and that in several senses from the divine
   purpose. If you are holy, it is because he has called you to holiness.
   If you have good works they come to you, according to the word of the
   apostle concerning good works, "which God hath before ordained that we
   should walk in them." When you see a costly vase which is the
   admiration of all eyes, you know that whatever of beauty there is in
   that vessel was originally in the artist's plan. If you have examined
   his sketches, you have seen every elegant line, and every graceful
   figure. Even so, beloved, if you have been sanctified it is according
   to the eternal design, which was settled in grace and wisdom, before
   the skies were formed.

   All our fruit springs from our God as to calling. You were dead in
   trespasses and sins. There were no good works in you by nature, and
   there never would have been, but he who commanded the light to shine
   out of darkness hath shined in your heart, to give you the knowledge of
   God, and then to turn you from dead works to serve the living and true
   God. You owe everything to your calling. The tree which is loaded with
   fruit, owes its fruit first of all, to its having been chosen to be in
   the garden, and next to its having been really planted there; for in
   our case, had we been left to grow in the wide wilderness, we should
   have brought forth no fruit unto God; but he took us up out of the
   place of barrenness, and put us in the rich soil which Jesus had
   watered with his own bloody sweat, and therefore we bring forth fruit.

   Our fruit is found from God as to union. The fruit of the branch is
   really traceable to the root. Cut the connection and the branch dies,
   and no fruit is hereafter produced. By virtue of our union with Christ
   we bring forth fruit. Every branch of grapes has been first in the
   root, it has passed through the stem, and flowed through the sap
   vessels, and fashioned itself externally into fruit, but it was first
   internal in the stem; so also every good work was first in Christ, and
   then was brought forth in us. O Christian, prize this precious doctrine
   of union to Christ; hold it firmly, because it is the source of every
   atom of fruitfulness which thou canst ever hope to know. If thou wert
   not joined to Jesus Christ, no fruit could ever be in thee.

   Our fruit comes from God, and from God alone, as to providence. When
   the dew-drops fall from heaven, each one may whisper to the tree and
   say, "From me is thy fruit found." When the cloud looks down from on
   high, and is about to distil its liquid treasure, it may thunder to the
   earth beneath, "From me is thy fruit found." And the bright sun above
   all others, as he paints the cheek of the apple, or swells the berries
   of the cluster, may well say to all the trees of the garden, "From me
   is your fruit found." The fruit owes much to the root--that is
   essential to fruitfulness--but it owes very much also to external care.
   Beloved, how much we owe to God's grace-providence! We are greatly
   debtors to his common providences, in that he maketh all things work
   together for good. But his grace-providence, in which he provides us
   constantly with quickening, teaching, correction, consolation,
   strength, or whatever else we want--to this we owe our all of
   usefulness or virtue.

   Our fruit is found in God as to the matter of husbandry. The knife
   which the gardener taketh from his pocket, might talk to the tree and
   say, "Much of thy fruit is found in me. Thou wouldst not yield such an
   abundance if it were not for my sharp edge. I make thee bleed a little,
   as I take away thy superfluous shoots, but thou hadst not such goodly
   clusters if it were not of me." So is it, Christian, with that pruning
   which the Lord gives to thee. "My Father is the husbandman. Every
   branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch
   that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit."

   Thus the text may be read in very many ways. They will all come to
   one--that we have nothing, except as we receive it from above. "What
   hast thou which thou hast not received?" I may say, to conclude this
   head, that all our fruit is found in God, because he will, having been
   the author of it, get all the glory of it. Of all our spiritual life he
   shall have the praise, for it is all due to him, and if he giveth us a
   crown at the last, we will cast it at his feet.

   Brethren, you know this doctrine well enough without my enlarging upon
   it; you know how constantly Scripture teacheth us that we can do
   nothing without Christ. We can sin; we can ruin our own souls; we can
   bring forth the apples of Sodom and the grapes of Gomorrah, but
   anything which is lovely, and honest, and of good repute, must come
   from him who is glorious in working. You have no question or quibble
   about this. "You hath he quickened;" you trace your life to him You
   doth he quicken day by day; you owe the continuance of your life to
   him. You know as a matter of doctrine that "in him we live and move and
   have our being," and that "every good gift and every perfect gift is
   from above." I need not confirm this doctrine: no argument is required.
   You have never erred from the truth in this respect; you could not be
   Christians if you did, for I hold this to be fundamental truth, in all
   godliness, that salvation from first to last is of the Lord. Salvation
   is not of yourselves, it is the gift of God. Let us heartily praise him
   whose workmanship we are.

   II. We come now to THE EXPERIENCE. Experimentally we have proof that
   all our fruit is in God. Let me remind you of your experience when you
   were the servants of the flesh. What fruit had ye then in those days?
   What repentance did your natural mind bring forth? What faith in Christ
   did your unrenewed soul ever beget or foster? What love to God ever
   stirred your carnal heart? What affection for the brotherhood possessed
   your alienated spirit? You must say that at that time you were without
   God and without hope, and certainly without fruit. "What fruit had ye
   then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed?" A painful remembrance
   of your former estate compels you to feel the truth of the Lord's Word,
   "In me is thy fruit found."

   Again, when the law began to work in your heart, and you were in a
   state of bondage, having enough of light to see your darkness, and
   enough of life to mourn your death--what fruit had ye then when ye were
   under the law? The law told you what you should do; did it enable you
   to do anything? The ten commandments set before you a perfect rule: but
   was it not "weak through the flesh?" You had a very clear perception of
   the justice and righteousness of God: did the perception reconcile you
   to justice or to holiness? Let me ask you, did the law of God ever make
   you love him? Did the awakenings of your conscience, which proceeded
   from it ever lead you to trust in Jesus Christ? They may have been
   overruled to this purpose, but the law worketh wrath, and as long as
   you were under it, it rather produced sin in you than righteousness.
   Such was Paul's experience, "When the commandment came, sin revived,
   and I died," "for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou
   shalt not covet." As a child might never care to run into the street,
   but being told not to do it, he straightway doth it by reason of the
   perversity of his nature, just so it is with us by nature; the
   forbidden thing our flesh lusteth after. All the enmity of carnal
   nature is provoked to yet greater sin by the law. That which should
   have been a bit, becomes a spur. Cold water quencheth fire, and yet
   when poured on lime, produceth a vehement heat. So the law acts
   contrary to its own nature, by reason of the depravity of the human
   heart. Thus were you, my brethren, led by a very sorrowful experience,
   to feel that from Christ must come your fruit; for none could be
   produced by the efforts of the flesh, backed up by the most earnest
   resolution and most devout prayer, and driven onward by the whip of the
   law.

   A sweeter experience has proved this to you. When did you begin to bear
   fruit? It was when you came to Christ and cast yourselves on the great
   atonement, and rested on the finished righteousness. Ab! what fruit you
   had then! Do you remember those early days? Did not your faith, and
   love, and zeal, form a garden of nuts, an orchard of pomegranates, with
   pleasant fruits? Then indeed the vine flourished, the tender grape
   appeared, the pomegranates budded forth, and the beds of spices gave
   forth their smell. Have you declined since then? Even if you have, I
   charge you to remember that time of love. Jesus remembers it, for he
   says, "I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine
   espousals, when thou wentest after me into the wilderness." He
   recollects that time of the singing of birds, when the voice of the
   turtle was heard in your land. Would God this were with you ever! He
   has not forgotten it, do you not forget it, but seek to enjoy it still.
   Your fruit began, you know it did, when you camne to Jesus Christ.

   My brethren, when have you been the most fruitless? This is another
   part of experience. Has not it been when you have lived farthest from
   the Lord Jesus Christ, when you have slackened in prayer, when you have
   departed somewhat from the simplicity of your faith, when your graces
   engrossed your attention instead of your Lord, when you said, "My
   mountain standeth firm, I shall never be moved;" and forgot where your
   strength lieth--has not it been then that your fruit has ceased? Some
   of us know that we have nothing out of Christ by terrible
   soul-emptyings and humblings of heart before the Lord. Brethren, it is
   no pleasant thing to be clean emptied out; but such times have happened
   to some of us, when we have felt that if one prayer would save us, if
   the Holy Spirit did not aid us, we were damned; if one good thought
   would take us to heaven, we could not reach it; the vileness of our
   heart has been so clear before our eyes, that had not it been that
   there was a mighty God to trust to we should have given up in despair.

   "How seldom do I rise to God,

   Or taste the joys above!

   Corruption presses down my faith,

   And chills my flaming love.

   When smiling mercy courts my soul

   With all its heavenly charms,

   This stubborn, this relentless thing,

   Would thrust it from my arms."

   In such seasons we do well to cry, "Quicken thou me, O Lord, according
   to thy word." Then you feel that to will is present with you, but how
   to perform that which is good, you find not. It is a very easy thing
   for me to exhort you, but sometimes I do not find it very easy to do
   myself what I exhort you to do. And there are times with us, dear
   friends, when, though we know our interest in Christ, we are wretched
   under a deep sense of the creature's fickleness, sinfulness, and death.
   Our moan is, " wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the
   body of this death?" When you have seen the utter emptiness of all
   creature confidence, then you have been able to say, "From him all my
   fruit must be found, for no fruit can ever come from me." We shall find
   from Scripture, I am sure--let our past experience confirm it--that the
   more we depend upon the grace of God in Christ Jesus, and wait upon the
   Holy Spirit, pleading that his influences may operate in our hearts,
   the more we shall bring forth fruit unto God. If I could bear fruit
   without my God, I would loathe the accursed thing, for it would be the
   fruit of pride--the fruit of an arrogant setting up of one's self in
   independence of the Creator No; the Lord deliver us from all faith, all
   hope, all love which do not spring from himself! May we have none of
   our own-manufactured graces about us. May we have nothing but that
   which is minted in heaven, and is therefore made of the pure metal. May
   we have no grace, pray no prayer, do no works, serve God in nothing
   except as we depend upon his strength and receive his Spirit. Any
   experience which comes short of a knowledge that we must get all from
   God, is a deceiving experience. But if you have been brought to find
   everything in him, beloved, this is a mark of a child of God. Cultivate
   a spirit of deep humiliation before the Most High; seek to know more
   your nothingness, and to prove more the omnipotence of the eternal God.
   There are two books I have tried to read, but I have not got through
   the first page yet. The first is the book of my own ignorance, and
   emptiness, and nothingness--what a great book is that! It will take us
   all our lives to read it, and I question whether Methuselah ever got to
   the last page. There is another book I must read, or else the first
   volume will drive me mad--it is the book of God's all-sufficiency. I
   have not got through the first word of that, much less the first page,
   but reading the two together, I would spend all my days. This is
   heaven's own literature, the wisdom which cometh from above. Less than
   nothing I can boast, and yet "I can do all things through Christ which
   strengtheneth me." Having nothing yet possessing all things." Black as
   the tents of Kedar, yet fair as the curtains of Solomon: dark as hell's
   profoundest night, and yet "Fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and
   terrible as an army with banners."

   III. We now arrive at the PRACTICAL POINT.

   1. First then, dear friends, let us look to Jesus Christ for fruit in
   the same way in which we first looked to him for shade. That sounds
   like something you have heard a great many times before. Very well, but
   have you really understood it? To give an illustration--you want to
   overcome an angry temper! You are given to ebullitions of passion--you
   try to overcome that. How do you go to work? It is very possible there
   are even believers here who have never tried the right way. How did I
   get salvation? I came to Jesus just as I was, and I trusted him to save
   me. Can I kill my angry temper in the same way? It is the only way in
   which I can ever kill it. I must go to Christ with it, and say to him,
   "Lord, I trust thee to deliver me from it." This is the only death-blow
   it will ever receive. Are you covetous? Do you feel the world entangle
   you? You may struggle against this evil as long as you like, but if it
   be your besetting sin, you will never be delivered from it in any way
   but the cross. Take it to Christ. Tell him, "Lord, I have trusted thee,
   and thy name is Jesus--Thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall
   save his people from their sins'--Lord, this is one of my sins; save me
   from it!" Do not take Jesus Christ with the blood only, and without the
   water--that is to have only half-a-Christ. Pray to be forgiven, but ask
   also to be sanctified. Sing with Toplady--

   "Let the water and the blood,

   From thy river side which flowed,

   Be of sin the double cure,

   Cleanse me from its guilt and power."

   I know what some of you do. You go to Christ for forgiveness, and then
   you go to the law for power to fight your sins. " foolish Galatians,
   who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth?" Tell me,
   did ye receive faith by the law, or by the operation of grace? "Are ye
   so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the
   flesh?" The only weapon to fight sin with is the spear which pierced
   Christ's side. Nothing can kill the viprous brood of hell but drops of
   Jesus' precious blood. Take your sins to Christ's cross, sir, for the
   old man can only be crucified there: we are crucified with him; we are
   buried with him. If I be dead to the world, I must be dead with him,
   and if I rise again to newness of life, I must rise in him. Ordinances
   are nothing without Christ as means of mortification. Baptism is
   nothing, except as we are buried with him in baptism unto death. The
   Lord's Supper is nothing, except as we eat his flesh and drink his
   blood, and have communion with him. And your prayers and your
   repentances, and your tears--the whole of them put together--are not
   worth a farthing apart from him. Every flower which grows in your
   garden will wither, and the sooner it is blasted and withered the
   better for you; only the rose of Sharon will bloom in heaven. "None but
   Jesus can do helpless sinners good;" or helpless saints either. You
   must overcome by the blood of the Lamb.

   2. Another practical observation is this--let us cultivate those graces
   most which bring us most to Christ, for these will be the most
   fruitful. Let me look well to my faith; let me see that I keep it
   purely stayed on him, having no supplementary confidence, but resting
   wholly and absolutely upon the finished work of my Lord. Let me see to
   my love. Let my Lord be to me altogether lovely. Lord, help me to sing,
   "My beloved is mine, and I am his." Sometimes graciously enable me to
   sing, "He brought me to the banqueting-house, and his banner over me
   was love. His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth
   embrace me." Faith and love are the great fruitbearers. A gardener
   says, "There is such and such a twig, I must not cut that off, because
   it is to the young wood that I am looking for my summer fruits." So he
   taketh care of it. There is that, believer, a growing faith and growing
   love to which you must look as the fruitbearing shoots, because they
   pre-eminently link your soul to Christ, and most evidently have
   intercourse with him. Cultivate those things which lead you most to
   him.

   3. A third practical piece of advice. Be most in those engagements
   which you have experimentally proved to draw you nearest to Christ,
   because it is from him that all your fruits proceed. Any holy exercise
   which will bring you to him will help you to bear fruit Do you find
   prayer the channel of Jesus' manifestations? Do you find yourself
   profited in the public means of grace? Is it the breaking of bread
   which we love to celebrate every Sabbath day, which is most precious to
   you? If so, wherever Jesus Christ layeth bare his heart to you, there
   be you found; and if there be any one means of grace which has been
   more rich to you than another, use it with the greatest perseverance.
   Use them all, dear friends, do not neglect any, hut especially use
   those most which bring you nearest to your Lord.

   4. Lastly, let none of us--whether we be the Lord's people or not--let
   none of us ever insult Christ by thinking that we are to bring fruit to
   him as a recommendation to his love. "From me is thy fruit found." Now
   there may be some saint here who has lost his evidences, and he dare
   not approach the throne of grace as he used to do, because he says "I
   have sinned--I must produce fresh fruit before I dare come." My dear
   friend! My dear friend! Bring fruit to Christ! How can you talk in so
   legal a fashion? All the fruit you ever will have you must first get
   from him! Come to him as you are and get your fruit out of him. Never
   suppose that you must bring Christ a present or else you must not come
   to him. He does not want your money. If he takes it he will give it
   back to you in your sack's mouth. He will receive your fruit as an
   offering, but never as a reconciliation. There are those here this
   morning who are not converted as yet. They are saying, "I dare not seek
   the Lord, I dare not trust Christ. I know the gospel is, trust Christ
   and you are saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned; but I
   must not trust him, I am a drunkard, I have been a swearer, I am a
   Sabbath-breaker, I will wait until I am better and then I will come to
   Christ." Why how can you talk thus? "From him is thy fruit found." If
   there be any fruit you must come to Jesus Christ for it. Am I, if I am
   poor and ragged, am I to buy a new coat before I may beg a garment?
   What a strange proposal that I should do for myself what Christ came to
   do. How can that be reasonable? If I saw a man standing outside the
   baths and wash-houses, and he should say, "Well really, I've just come
   home from my work and am as black as a sweep, but I dare not go into
   those baths until I have washed my face first." I should say, "How
   foolish! it is in the bath that your washing is to be found." There is
   no fitness wanted for Christ but that which is in Christ: nothing
   wanted in you, everything is in him. To use the old proverb," Why carry
   coals to Newcastle?" Who would think it a profitable business for our
   London merchants, in the cold winter time, when the price of coals is
   very high, to charter all the ships they can, and send them laden with
   coals to Newcastle? If they did so, you would think them mad. And yet
   there are many sinners penniless, comfortless, with no good thing of
   their own, who want to bring good works to Jesus! This is carrying
   coals to Newcastle with a vengeance. Oh! folly! folly! folly! Go with
   your ship all black and empty, sail up the harbour, and the pit's mouth
   will soon yield to you an abundance of precious store. Go to Jesus as
   you are. Do you want faith to-day--repentance--grace? Go to Christ for
   it. Go to him, resting on him, dependent on him, believing that he is
   ready to save you, to begin, to carry on, and finish your salvation. He
   will be as good as you ever believe him to be, and infinitely better.
   If thou canst believe him princely enough to put all thy sins away, and
   to cover thee with his righteousness, he will do it, for never man
   thought too well of Christ. If thou canst get a big thought of Christ,
   thou big sinner--if thou canst believe on the eternal Son of the
   eternal Father, who once poured out his blood in streams on Calvary
   thou art secure. God help thee. Amen.

                               A Bundle of Myrrh

   A Sermon

   (No. 558)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, February 28th, 1864, by the

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me; he shall lie all night
   betwixt my breasts."--Song of Solomon 1:13.

   CERTAIN DIVINES have doubted the inspiration of Solomon's Song; others
   have conceived it to be nothing more than a specimen of ancient
   love-songs, and some have been afraid to preach from it because of its
   highly poetical character. The true reason for all this avoidance of
   one of the most heavenly portions of God's Word lies in the fact that
   the spirit of this Song is not easily attained. Its music belongs to
   the higher spiritual life, and has no charm in it for unspiritual ears.
   The Song occupies a sacred enclosure into which none may enter
   unprepared. "Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon
   thou standest is holy ground," is the warning voice from its secret
   tabernacles. The historical books I may compare to the outer courts of
   the Temple; the Gospels, the Epistles, and the Psalms, bring us into
   the holy place or the Court of the priests; but the Song of Solomon is
   the most holy place: the holy of holies, before which the veil still
   hangs to many an untaught believer. It is not all the saints who can
   enter here, for they have not yet attained unto the holy confidence of
   faith, and that exceeding familiarity of love which will permit them to
   commune in conjugal love with the great Bridegroom. We are told that
   the Jews d id not permit the young student to read the Canticles--that
   years of full maturity were thought necessary before the man could
   rightly profit by this mysterious Song of loves; possibly they were
   wise, at any rate the prohibition foreshadowed a great truth. The Song
   is, in truth, a book for full-grown Christians. Babes in grace may find
   their carnal and sensuous affections stirred up by it towards Jesus,
   whom they know, rather "after the flesh" than in the spirit; but it
   needs a man of fuller growth, who has leaned his head upon the bosom of
   his Master, and been baptized with his baptism, to ascend the lofty
   mountains of love on which the spouse standeth with her beloved. The
   Sung, from the first verse to the last, will be clear to those who have
   received an unction from the holy One, and know all things. (1 John
   2:20.) You are aware, dear friends, that there are very few
   commentaries upon the Epistles of John. Where we find fifty
   commentaries upon any book of St. Paul, you will hardly find one upon
   John. Why is that? Is the book too difficult? The words are very
   simple; there is hardly a word of four syllables anywhere in John's
   Epistles. Ah! but they are so saturated through and through with the
   spirit of love, which also perfumes this Book of Solomon, that those
   who are not taught in the school of communion, cry out, "We cannot read
   it, for it is sealed." The Song is a golden casket, of which love is
   the key rather than learning. Those who have not attained unto heights
   of affection, those who have not been educated by familiar intercourse
   with Jesus, cannot come near to this mine of treasure, "seeing it is
   hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of
   heaven." O for the soaring eagle wing of John, and the far-seeing
   dove's eyes of Solomon; but the most of us are blind and cannot see
   afar off. May God be pleased to make us grow in grace, and give us so
   much of the Holy Spirit, that with feet like hind's feet we may stand
   upon the high places of Scripture, and this morning have some near and
   dear intercourse with Christ Jesus.

   Concerning our text, let us talk very simply, remarking first, that
   Christ is very precious to believers; secondly, that there is good
   reason why he should be; thirdly, that mingled with this sense of
   preciousness, there is a joyous consciousness of possession of him; and
   that therefore, fourthly, there is an earnest desire for perpetual
   fellowship with him. If you look at the text again, you will see all
   these matters in it.

   I. First, then, CHRIST JESUS IS UNUTTERABLY PRECIOUS TO BELIEVERS. The
   words manifestly imply this: "A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto
   me." She calls him her "well-beloved," and so expresses her love most
   emphatically; it is not merely beloved, but well-beloved. Then she
   looks abroad about her, to find a substance which shall be at once
   valuable in itself and useful in its properties; and lighting upon
   myrrh, she saith, "A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me."
   Without looking into the figure just now, we keep to the statement that
   Christ is precious to the believer.

   Observe first, that nothing gives the believer so much joy as
   fellowship with Christ. Ask yourselves, you who have eaten at his table
   and have been made to drink of his cup, where can such sweetness be
   found as you have tasted in communion with Jesus? The Christian has joy
   as other men have in the common mercies of life. For him there are
   charms in music, excellence in painting, and beauty in sculpture; for
   him the hills have sermons of majesty, the rocks hymns of sublimity,
   and the valleys lessons of love. He can look upon all things with an
   eye as clear and joyous as another man's; he can be glad both in God's
   gifts and God's works. He is not dead to the happiness of the
   household: around his hearth he finds happy associations, without which
   life were drear indeed. His children fill his home with glee, his wife
   is his solace and delight, his friends are his comfort and refreshment.
   He accepts the comforts which soul and body can yield him according as
   God seeth it wise to afford them unto him; but he will tell you that in
   all these separately, yea, and in all of them added together, he doth
   not find such substantial delight as he doth in the person of his Lord
   Jesus. Brethren, there is a wine which no vineyard on earth ever
   yielded; there is a bread which even the corn-fields of Egypt could
   never bring forth. You and I have said, when we have beheld others
   finding their god in earthly comforts, "You may boast in gold, and
   silver, and raiment, but I will rejoice in the God of my salvation." In
   our esteem, the joys of earth are little better than husks for swine
   compared with Jesus the heavenly manna. I would rather have one
   mouthful of Christ's love, and a sip of his fellowship, than a whole
   world full of carnal delights. What is the chaff to the wheat? What is
   the sparkling paste to the true diamond? What is a dream to the
   glorious reality? What is time's mirth in its best trim compared to our
   Lord Jesus in his most despised estate? If you know anything of the
   inner life, you will all of you confess that our highest, purest, and
   most enduring joys must be the fruit of the tree of life which is in
   the midst of the Paradise of God. No spring yields such sweet water as
   that well of God which was digged with the soldier's spear. As for the
   house of feasting, the joy of harvest, the mirth of marriage, the
   sports of youth, the recreations of maturer age, they are all as the
   small dust of the balance compared with the joy of Immanuel our best
   beloved. As the Preacher said, so say we, "I said of laughter, It is
   mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?" "Vanity of vanities; all is vanity."
   All earthly bliss is of the earth earthy, but the comforts of Christ's
   presence are like himself heavenly. We can review our communion with
   Jesus, and find no regrets of emptiness therein; there are no dregs in
   this wine; no dead flies in this ointment. The joy of the Lord is solid
   and enduring. Vanity hath not looked upon it, but discretion and
   prudence testify that it abideth the test of years, and is in time and
   in eternity worthy to be called "the only true delight."

   "What is the world with all its store?

   "Tis but a bitter sweet;

   When I attempt to pluck the rose,

   A pricking thorn I meet.

   Here perfect bliss can ne'er be found,

   The honey's mix'd with gall;

   'Midst changing scenes and dying friends,

   Be thou my All in All."

   We may plainly see that Christ is very precious to the believer,
   because to him there is nothing good without Christ. Believer, have you
   not found in the midst of plenty a dire and sore famine if your Lord
   has been absent? The sun was shining, but Christ had hidden himself and
   all the world was black to you; or it was a night of tempest, and there
   were many stars, but since the bright and morning star was gone on that
   dreary main, where you were tossed with doubts and fears, no other star
   could shed so much as a ray of light. O, what a howling wilderness is
   this world without my Lord! If once he groweth angry, and doth, though
   it be for a moment, hide himself from me, withered are the flowers of
   my garden; my pleasant fruits decay; the birds suspend their songs, and
   black night lowers over all my hopes. Nothing can compensate for the
   company of the Savior: all earth's candles cannot make daylight if the
   Sun of Righteousness be gone.

   On the other hand, when all earthly comforts have failed you, have you
   not found quite enough in your Lord? Your very-worst times have been
   your best times? You must almost cry to go back to your bed of
   sickness, for Jesus made it as a royal throne, whereon you reigned with
   him. Those dark nights--ah! they were not dark, your bright days since
   then have been darker far. Do you remember when you were poor? Oh! how
   near Christ was to you, and how rich he made you! You were despised and
   rejected of men, and no man gave you a good word! Ah! sweet was his
   fellowship then, and how delightful to hear him say, "Fear thou not;
   for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God!" As afflictions
   abound, even so do consolations abound by Christ Jesus. The devil, like
   Nebuchadnezzar, heated the furnace seven times hotter, but who would
   have it less furiously blazing? No wise believer; for the more terrible
   the heat the greater the glory in the fact that we were made to tread
   those glowing coals, and not a hair of our head was singed, nor so much
   as the smell of fire passed upon us, because the Son of God walked
   those glowing coals in our company. Yes, we can look with resignation
   upon penury, disease, and even death; for if all comforts be taken from
   us, we should still be blest, so long as we enjoy the presence of the
   Lord our Savior.

   Nor should I be straining the truth if I say that the Christian would
   sooner give up anything than forsake his Master. I have known some who
   have been afraid to look that text in the face which saith, "He that
   loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me," or
   that--"Except a man hate (or love less) his father and mother, and wife
   and children, he cannot be my disciple." Yet I have found that those
   have frequently proved to be the most sincere lovers of Jesus who have
   been most afraid that he had not the best place in their hearts.
   Perhaps the best way is not to sit down calmly to weigh our love, for
   it is not a thing to be measured with cool judgment, but put your love
   to some practical test. Now, if it came to this, that you must deny
   Christ, or give up the dearest thing you have, would you deliberate?
   The Lord knoweth I speak what I feel in my own soul--when it comes to
   that, I could not hesitate a second. If there were a stake and burning
   faggots, I might flinch from the fire, but so mighty is divine love
   that it would doubtless drive me to the flames sooner than let me leave
   Jesus. But if it comes to this, "Wilt thou lose thine eyes or give up
   Christ?" I would cheerfully be blind. Or if it were asked, "Wilt thou
   have thy right arm withered from its socket or give up Christ?" Ay; let
   both arms go; let them both drop from the shoulder blades. Or if it
   should be, "Wilt thou be from this day dumb and never speak before the
   multitude?" Oh! better to be dumb than lose him. Indeed, when I talk of
   this it seems to be an insult to my Master, to put hands, and eyes, and
   tongue, in comparison with him.

   "Nor to my eyes is light so dear

   Nor friendship half so sweet."

   If you compare life itself with Jesus, it is not to be named in the
   same day. If it should be said, "Will you live without Christ or die
   with Christ?" you could not deliberate, for to die with Christ is to
   live with Christ for ever; but to live without Christ is to die the
   second death, the terrible death of the soul's eternal perdition. No,
   there is no choice there. I think we could go further, dear friends,
   and say, not only could we give up everything, but I think, when love
   is fervent, and the flesh is kept under, we could suffer anything with
   Christ. I met, in one of Samuel Rutherford's letters, an extraordinary
   expression, where he speaks of the coals of divine wrath all falling
   upon the head of Christ, so that not one might fall upon his people.
   "And yet," saith he, "if one of those coals should drop from his head
   upon mine and did utterly consume me, yet if I felt it was a part of
   the coals that fell on him, and I was bearing it for his sake, and in
   communion with him, I would choose it for my heaven." That is a strong
   thing to say, that to suffer with Christ would be his heaven, if he
   assuredly knew that it was for and with Christ, that he was suffering.
   Oh! there is indeed a heavenliness about suffering for Jesus. His cross
   hath such a majesty and mystery of delight in it, that the more heavy
   it becometh, the more lightly doth it sit upon the believer's
   shoulders.

   One thing I know proveth, beloved, that you esteem Christ to be very
   precious, namely, that you want others to know him too. Do you not feel
   a pining in your souls till others hearts be filled with the love of
   Christ? My eyes could weep themselves out of their sockets for some of
   you who are ignorant of my Master's love. Poor souls! ye are sitting
   outside the feast when the door is wide open, and the king himself is
   within. Ye choose to be out in the highways and under the hedges sooner
   than come to this wedding-feast, where the oxen and fatlings are
   killed, and all things are ready--oh! did you know him, did you know
   him, you would never be able to live without him. If your eyes had ever
   seen him once, or if your heart had ever known the charm of his
   presence, you would think it to be a hell to be for a moment without
   Christ. O poor blind eyes which cannot see him, and deaf ears which
   cannot hear him, and hard stony hearts which cannot melt before him,
   and hell-besotted souls which cannot appreciate the majesty of his
   love, God help you! God help you! and bring you yet to know and rejoice
   in him. The more your love grows, beloved, the more insatiable will be
   your desire that others should love him, till it will come to this that
   you will be, like Paul, "in labors more abundant," spending and being
   spent that you may bring the rest of Christ's elect body into union
   with their glorious head.

   II. But, secondly, THE SOUL CLINGETH TO CHRIST, AND SHE HATH GOOD
   REASON FOR SO DOING, for her own words are "A bundle of myrrh is my
   well-beloved unto me." We will take the myrrh first, and then consider
   the bundle next.

   1. Jesus Christ is like myrrh. Myrrh may be well the type of Christ for
   its preciousness. It was an exceedingly expensive drug. We know that
   Jacob sent some of it down into Egypt as being one of the choice
   products of the land. It is always spoken of in Scripture as being a
   rich, rare, and costly substance. But no myrrh could ever compare with
   him, for Jesus Christ is so precious, that if heaven and earth were put
   together they could not buy another Savior. When God gave to the world
   his Son, he gave the best that heaven had. Take Christ out of heaven,
   and there is nothing for God to give. Christ was God's all, for is it
   not written, "In him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily?"
   Oh! precious gift of the whole of deity in the person of Christ! How
   inestimably precious is that body of his which he took of the substance
   of the virgin! Well might angels herald the coming of this immaculate
   Savior, well might they watch over his holy life, for he is precious in
   his birth, and precious in all his actions. How precious is he, dear
   friends, as myrrh in the offering of his great atonement! What a costly
   sacrifice was that! At what a price were ye redeemed! Not with silver
   and gold, but with the precious blood of Christ. How precious is he
   too, in his resurrection! He justifies all his people at one
   stroke--rising from the dead--that glorious sun scatters all the nights
   of all his people by one rising. How precious is he in his ascension,
   as he leads captivity captive, and scattereth gifts among men! And how
   precious to-day in those incessant pleadings of his through which the
   mercies of God come down like the angels upon Jacob's ladder to our
   needy souls! Yes, he is to the believer in every aspect like myrrh for
   rarity and excellence.

   Myrrh, again, was pleasant. It was a pleasant thing to be in chamber
   perfumed with myrrh. Through the nostrils myrrh conveys delight to the
   human mind; but Christ gives delight to his people, not through one
   channel, but through every avenue. It is true that all his garments
   smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, but he hath not spiritual smell
   alone, the taste shall be gratified too, for we eat his flesh and drink
   his blood. Nay, our feeling is ravished, when his left hand is under us
   and his right hand doth embrace us. As for his voice it is most sweet,
   and our soul's ear is charmed with its melody. Let God give him to our
   sight, and what can our eyes want more? Yea, he is altogether lovely.
   Thus every gate of the soul hath commerce with Christ Jesus in the
   richest and rarest commodities. There is no way by which a human spirit
   can have communion with Jesus which doth not yield unto that spirit
   fresh and varied delights. O beloved, we cannot compare him merely to
   myrrh. He is everything which is good to look upon, or to taste, or to
   handle, or to smell--all put together in one, the quintessence of all
   delights. As all the rivers run into the sea, so all delights center
   into Christ. The sea is not full, but Jesus is fall to the very brim.

   Moreover, myrrh is perfuming. It is used to give a sweet smell to other
   things. It was mingled with the sacrifice, so that it was not only the
   smoke of the fat of kidneys of rams, and the flesh of fat beasts, but
   there was a sweet fragrance of myrrh, which went up with the sacrifice
   to heaven. And surely, beloved, Jesus Christ is very perfuming to his
   people. Does not he perfume their prayers, so that the Lord smelleth a
   sweet savor? Doth he not perfume their songs, so that they become like
   vials full of odour sweet? Doth he not perfume our ministry, for is it
   not written, "He causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest
   the savor of his knowledge by us in every place. For we are unto God a
   sweet savor of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that
   perish." Our persons are perfumed with Christ. Whence get we our
   spikenard but from him? Whither shall we go to gather camphire which
   shall make our persons and presence acceptable before God but to him?
   "For we are accepted in the beloved." "Ye are complete in
   him"--"perfect in Christ Jesus"--"for he hath made us kings and priests
   unto our God, and we shall reign for ever and ever."

   Myrrh has preserving qualities. The Egyptians used it in embalming the
   dead: and we find Nicodemus and the holy women bringing myrrh and aloes
   in which to wrap the dead body of the Savior. It was used to prevent
   corruption. What is there which can preserve the soul but Christ Jesus?
   What is the myrrh which keeps our works, which in themselves are dead,
   and corrupt, and rotten--what, I say, keeps them from becoming a foul
   stench in the nostrils of God, but that Christ is in them? What we have
   done out of love to Christ, what we have offered through his mediation,
   what has been perfumed by faith in his person, becomes acceptable. God
   looketh upon anything we say, or anything we do, and if he seeth Christ
   in it, he accepteth it; but if there be no Christ, he putteth it away
   as a foul thing. See to it then, beloved, that you never pray a prayer
   which is not sweetened with Christ. I would never preach a sermon--the
   Lord forgive me if I do--which is not full to overflowing with my
   Master. I know one who said I was always on the old string, and he
   would come and hear me no more; but if I preached a sermon without
   Christ in it, he would come. Ah! he will never come while this tongue
   moves, for a sermon without Christ in it--a Christless sermon! A brook
   without water; a cloud without rain; a well which mocks the traveler; a
   tree twice dead, plucked up by the root; a sky without a sun; a night
   without a star. It were a realm of death--a place of mourning for
   angels and laughter for devils. O Christian, we must have Christ! Do
   see to it that every day when you wake you give a fresh savor of Christ
   upon you by contemplating his person. Live all the day, trying as much
   as lieth in you, to season your hearts with him, and then at night, lie
   down with him upon your tongue. It is said of Samuel Rutherford, that
   he often did fall asleep talking about Christ, and was often heard in
   his dreams, saying sweet things about his Savior. There is nothing
   which can preserve us and keep us from sin, and make our works holy and
   pure, like this "bundle of myrrh."

   Myrrh again, was used as a disinfectant. When the fever is abroad, we
   know people who wear little bags of camphor about their necks. They may
   be very good; I do not know. But the Orientals believed that in times
   of pest and plague, a little bag of myrrh worn between the breasts
   would be of essential service to whoever might carry it. And there
   doubtless is some power in myrrh to preserve from infectious disease.
   Well, brethren, certain I am it is so with Christ. You have to go into
   the world which is like a great lazar-house; but if you carry Christ
   with you, you will never catch the world's disease. A man may be worth
   never so much money, he will never get worldly if he keepeth Christ on
   his heart. A man may have to tug and toil for his livelihood, and be
   very poor, he will never be discontented and murmuring if he lives
   close to Christ. O you who have to handle the world, see to it that you
   handle the Master more than the world. Some of you have to work with
   drunken and swearing men; others are cast into the midst of
   frivolities--O take my Master with you! and sin's plagues can have no
   influence upon your moral nature.

   But myrrh was believed by the ancient physicians to do more than
   this--it was a cure--it did not merely prevent, but it healed. I do not
   know how many diseases are said to be healed by the use of myrrh, nor
   do I altogether suppose that these Oriental physicians spoke from
   facts, for they were too much given to ascribe qualities to drugs,
   which those drugs did not possess; however even modern physicians
   believe myrrh to have many valuable medical properties. Certain is it
   that your Christ is the best medicine for the soul. His name is Jehovah
   Rophi--"I am the Lord that healeth them." When we see Luke called "the
   beloved physician," we almost grudge him the name. I will take it from
   him and give it to my Master, for he deserves it far more than Luke.
   The beloved physician! he touched the leper, and he was made whole. He
   did but look upon those who were lame. and they leaped as a hart. His
   voice startled the silence of Hades, and brought back the soul to the
   body. What cannot Christ do? He can heal anything. You who are sick
   this morning, sick with doubts and fears, you who are sick with
   temptation, you who struggle with an angry temper, or with the
   death-like sleep of sloth, get Christ, and you are healed. Here all
   things meet, and in all these things we may say, "A bundle of myrrh is
   my well-beloved unto me."

   I have not done yet, for myrrh was used in the East as a beautifier. We
   read of Esther, that before she was introduced to Ahasuerus, she and
   the virgins were bidden to prepare themselves, and among other things,
   they used myrrh. The belief of Oriental women was, that it removed
   wrinkles and stains from the face, and they used it constantly for the
   perfecting of their charms. I do not know how that may be, but I know
   that nothing makes the believer so beautiful as being with Christ. He
   is beautiful in the eyes of God, of holy angels, and of his fellow-men.
   I know some Christians whom it is a great mercy to speak to: if they
   come into your cottage, they leave behind them tokens of remembrance,
   in the choice words they utter. To get them into the Church is a
   thousand mercies, and if they join the Sunday-school, of what value
   they are! Let me tell you that the best gauge of a Christian's
   usefulness will be found in the degree in which he has been with Jesus
   and learned of him. Do not tell me it is the scholar, do not say to me
   it is the man of eloquence, do not say it is the man of substance--well
   we would have all these consecrate what they have to Christ--but it is
   the man of God who is the strong man; it is the man who has been with
   Jesus who is the pillar of the Church; and a light to the world. O
   brethren, may the beauty of the Lord be upon us through being much with
   Christ.

   And I must not close this point without saying that myrrh might well be
   used as an emblem of our Lord from its connection with sacrifice. It
   was one of the precious drugs used in making the holy oil with which
   the priests were anointed and the frankincense which burned perpetually
   before God. It is this, the sacrificial character of Christ, which is
   at the root and bottom of all that Christ is most precious to his
   people. O Lamb of God our sacrifice, we must remember thee.

   2. Now there has been enough, surely, said about the myrrh. Have
   patience while we just notice that he is called a bundle of myrrh, or
   as some translate it, a bag of myrrh, or a box of myrrh.

   There were three sorts of myrrh; there was the myrrh in sprigs, which
   being burnt made a sweet smell; then there was myrrh, a dried spice;
   and then thirdly, there was myrrh a flowing oil. We do not know to
   which there is reference here. But why is it said "a bundle of myrrh?"
   First, for the plenty of it. He is not a drop of it, he is a casket
   full. He is not a sprig or flower of it, but a whole bundle full. There
   is enough in Christ for my necessities. There is more in Christ than I
   shall ever know--perhaps more than I shall understand even in heaven.

   A bundle again, for variety; for there is in Christ not only the one
   thing needful, but "ye are complete in him;" there is everything
   needful. Take Christ in his different characters, and you will see a
   marvellous variety--prophet, priest, king, husband, friend, shepherd.
   Take him in his life, death, resurrection, ascension, second advent,
   take him in his virtue, gentleness, courage, self-denial, love,
   faithfulness, truth, righteousness--everywhere it is a bundle. Some of
   God's judgments are manifold, but all God's mercies are manifold, and
   Christ being the sum of God's mercies, hath in fold upon fold of
   goodness. He is "a bundle of myrrh" for variety.

   He is a bundle of myrrh again, for preservation--not loose myrrh to be
   dropped on the floor or trodden on, but myrrh tied up, as though God
   bound up all virtues and excellencies in his Son: not myrrh spilt on
   the ground, but myrrh in a box--myrrh kept in a casket. Such is Christ.
   The virtue and excellence which goeth out of Christ is quite as strong
   today as in the day when the woman touched the hem of his garment and
   was healed. "Able to save unto the uttermost them that come unto God
   through him," is he still unto this hour.

   A bundle of myrrh again, to shew how diligently we should take care of
   it. We must bind him up, we must keep our thoughts of him and knowledge
   of him as under lock and key, lest the devil should steal anything from
   us. We must treasure up his words, prize his ordinances, obey his
   precepts, tie him up and keep him ever with us as a precious bundle of
   myrrh.

   And yet again, a bundle of myrrh for speciality, as if he were not
   common myrrh for everybody. No, no, no; there is distinguishing,
   discriminating grace--a bundle tied up for his people and labelled with
   their names from before the foundation of the world. No doubt there is
   an allusion here to the scent bottle used in every land. Jesus Christ
   is a bottle of myrrh, and he doth not give forth his smell to everybody
   but to those who know how to draw forth the stopper, who understand how
   to get into communion with him, to have close dealings with him. He is
   not myrrh for all who are in the house but for those who know how to
   put the bottle to their nostrils and receive the sweet perfume. Oh!
   blessed people whom the Lord hath admitted into his secrets! Oh! choice
   and happy people who are thus made to say "A bottle of myrrh is my
   well-beloved unto me."

   But I am afraid I tire you, especially those of you who do not know
   anything about my subject. There are some such here who know no more
   about what I am talking of than if they were Mahometans. They are
   listening to a new kind of religion now. The religion of Christ is as
   high above them as is the path of the eagle above that of the fish, and
   as much hidden from them as the way of the serpent on the rock from the
   eye of man. This is a path which the eagle's eye hath not seen, nor
   hath the lion's whelp trodden it; but I trust there are some here who
   know it.

   III. Our third remark was to be--that with a sense of Christ's
   preciousness is combined A CONSCIOUSNESS OF POSSESSION. It is "my
   well-beloved." My dear hearer, is Christ your well-beloved? A
   Savior--that is well; but my Savior--that is the best of the best. What
   is the use of bread if it is not mine? I may die of hunger. Of what
   value is gold, if it be not mine? I may yet die in a workhouse. I want
   this preciousness to be mine. "My well-beloved." Have you ever laid
   hold on Christ by the hand of faith?

   Will you take him again this morning, brethren, in Jesus? I know you
   will. Would that those who never did take him, would take him now and
   say, "My saviour." There stands his atonement, freely offered to you,
   may you have the grace to take it, and say, "My Savior, my Savior,"
   this morning. Has your heart taken him? It is well for us to use both
   hands, not only the hand of faith, but the hand of love, for this is
   the true embrace when both arms meet around our beloved. Do you love
   him? O souls, do you LOVE Christ, with an emphasis upon the word. Do
   not talk to me about a religion which dwells in the head and never gets
   into the heart. Get rid of it as quickly as you can; it will never
   bring you to heaven. It is not "I believe this and that" merely, but "I
   love." Ah! some who have been great fools in doctrine have been very
   wise in love. We tell our children to learn things "by heart." I think
   you can, you love Jesus, and if you cannot you must confess as I do,

   "A very wretch, Lord, I should prove,

   Had I no love to thee;

   Sooner than not my Savior love,

   O may I cease to be."

   But that is not the only word. "A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved
   unto me." That is not a redundant expression, "unto me." He is not so
   to many. Ah! my Lord is a root out of a dry ground to multitudes. A
   three-volume novel suits them better than his Book. They would sooner
   go to a play or a dance than they would have any fellowship with him.
   They can see the beauties upon the cheeks of this Jezebel world, but
   they cannot see the perfections of my Lord and Master. Well! well!
   well! Let them say what they will, and let them think as they please,
   every creature hath its own joy, but "a bundle of myrrh is my
   well-beloved unto me"--unto me--unto me, and if there is not another
   who finds him so, yet "a bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me." I
   would it were not with others as it is--I would that others did think
   so also of him; but let them say what they will, they shall not drive
   me out of my knowledge of this--"a bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved
   unto me." The infidel saith, "There is no God." The atheist would
   altogether laugh me to scorn. They shall say what they will, but "a
   bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me." Even bishops have been
   found who will take away a part of his Book, and so rend his garments,
   and rob him; and there be some who say his religion is out of date, and
   grace has lost his power; and they go after philosophy and vain
   conceit, and I know not what, but "a bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved
   unto me." They may have no nostril for him, they may have no desire
   after him; so let it be, but "a bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto
   me." I know there are some who say they have tried him and not found
   him sweet, and who have turned away from him and gone back to the
   beggarly elements of the world because they see nothing in Christ that
   they should desire him; but "a bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto
   me." Ah! Christian, this is what you want, a personal experience, a
   positive experience; you want to know for yourself; for there is no
   religion which is worth a button which is not burnt into you by
   personal experience; and there is no religion worth a straw which does
   not spring from your soul, which does lay not hold upon the very vitals
   of your spirit. Yes, you must say--I hope you can say as you go down
   those steps this morning, and enter again to-morrow into that busy,
   giddy world--you must say, "Let the whole world go astray, a bundle of
   myrrh is my well-beloved unto me.'"

   IV. Now the practical point closes it. A SENSE OF POSSESSION AND A
   SENSE OF ENJOYMENT WILL ALWAYS LEAD THE CHRISTIAN TO DESIRE CONSTANT
   FELLOWSHIP. "He" or rather "it shall lie all night betwixt my breasts."
   The Church does not say, "I will put this bundle of myrrh on my
   shoulders"--Christ is no burden to a Christian. She does not say, "I
   will put this bundle of myrrh on my back"--the Church does not want to
   have Christ concealed from her face. She desires to have him where she
   can see him, and near to her heart. The bundle of myrrh shall lie all
   night upon my heart. The words "All night" are not in the original; I
   do not know how they got into the translation. He is to be always
   there, not only all night but all day. It would be always night if he
   were not there, and it cannot be night when he is there, for

   "Midst darkest shade, if he appear,

   My dawning has begun."

   He shall always be upon our heart. I think that expression just means
   these three things. It is an expression of desire--her desire that she
   may have the consciousness of Christ's love continually. Do not you
   feel the same desire. O Christian, if thou hast ever been made like the
   chariots of Amminadib, it will be ill for thee if thou canst be content
   to be otherwise. If thou hast but once tasted Christ, thou wilt wait to
   feed upon him all day and all night, and as long as thou livest. My
   desire is that Jesus may abide with me from morn till even, in the
   world and in the Church, when I awake, when I sleep, when I go abroad,
   and when I come home into the bosom of my family. Is not that your
   desire that he may be always with you?

   But then, it is not only her desire, but it is also her confidence. She
   seems to say, "He will be with me thus." You may have a suspension of
   visible fellowship with Christ, but Christ never will go away from
   people really. He will be all night betwixt your breasts; he will at
   all times abide faithful to you. He may close his eyes and hide his
   face from you, but his heart never can depart from you. He has set you
   as a seal upon his heart, and increasingly will make you sensible of
   it. Recollect there is no suspension of Christ's union with his people,
   and no suspension of those saving influences which always make his
   people to stand complete in him.

   To conclude, this is also a resolve. She desires, she believes, and she
   resolves it. Lord, thou shalt be with me, thou shalt be with me always.
   I appeal to you, brethren, will you not make this resolve in God's
   strength this morning to cling close to Christ. Do not go talking, as
   you go home, about all sorts of nonsense; do not spend this afternoon
   in communion with folly and vanity, but throughout this day let your
   soul keep to Christ, to nothing but Christ. This evening we shall come
   to his table, to eat bread and drink wine, in remembrance of him, let
   us try if we can, that nothing shall make us give up Christ all this
   day. Have you got him, hold him and do not let him go till you bring
   him to your mother's house, to the chamber of her who bare you. Then
   there will be the family prayer at night. O, seek to keep him till you
   put your head upon the pillow. And then, on Monday morning, some of you
   have to go to work, and as soon as you get into the workshop or the
   factory, you say, "Now I must lose my Master." No, do not lose him.
   Hold him fast when your hand plies the hammer, and when your fingers
   hold the needle, still cling to him, in the market or in the exchange,
   on board ship, or in the field, do not let him go. You may have him
   with you all day. The Mahometan usually wears a piece of the Koran
   round his neck, and one, when converted to Christianity, put his New
   Testament in a little silken bag, and always wore it there. We need not
   such outward signs, but let us always have the Savior there; let us
   hang him about our neck as a charm against all evil; seek his blessed
   company, place him as a star upon your breast to be your honor and joy.

   Well, I have done, but I must have a word with the unconverted. There
   are some who can say, "I will have Christ always on my tongue." Away
   with tongue religion. You must have him on your heart. Ah! there are
   some who say, "I hope I shall have Christ on my heart in all eternity."
   You cannot have Christ in eternity if you do not have him in time. If
   you despise him to-day--in this life, he will reject you to-morrow in
   the world to come; and if he call and you refuse, one day you will call
   and he refuse. Do not put up with desires merely, dear friends--some of
   you have desires, and nothing more. Do not only desire Christ, but get
   him. Do not stop short with saying, "I should like to have him in my
   heart;" give no sleep to your eyes nor slumber to your eyelids, till by
   humble faith you have taken Christ to be your all in all. May the Lord
   bless these poor words, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

                             The Cripple at Lystra

   A Sermon

   (No. 559)

   by the

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and
   perceiving that he had faith to be healed, said with a loud voice,
   Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked."--Acts 14:9-10.

   I  HAVE READ in your hearing the story of the preaching of Paul and
   Barnabas in the town of Lystra. The name of Christ was there totally
   unknown. They were a sort of country people, partly pastoral and partly
   agricultural, who seem to have been deeply sunken in superstition. At
   the gates of their city there stood a great temple dedicated to
   Jupiter, and they appear to have been his zealous votaries. Coming down
   from the mountainside Paul and Barnabas enter the town, and when a
   fitting time has come, they stand up in the marketplace, or the street,
   and begin to talk concerning Jesus, the Son of God, who had come down
   from heaven, had suffered and died, and had again ascended up on high.
   The people gather round them. Among the rest a cripple listens with
   very marked attention. They preach again. The crowds are still greater,
   and on one occasion, while Paul is in the middle of a sermon, using his
   eyes to watch the audience as all preachers should do, and not looking
   up at the ceiling, or at the gallery-front as some preachers are wont
   to do, he marks this cripple, fixes his eyes upon him, and looks
   earnestly in his face. Either by the exercise of his judgment, or by
   the promptings of revelation, the apostle gathers that this man has
   faith--faith to be healed. In order to attract the attention of the
   people, to glorify the name of Christ, to publish more widely his
   glorious fame, and to make the miracle well known, Paul stops the
   sermon, and with a loud voice cries, "Stand upright on thy feet." The
   cripple leaps and praises God. The population are all amazed, and
   knowing that there was a tradition that Jupiter and Mercury had once
   appeared in that very town, a tradition preserved in the Metamorphoses
   of Ovid to the present day, they at once conclude that surely Jupiter
   and Mercury must be come again. They fix upon Barnabas, who was
   probably the elder and the nobler looking man, for Jupiter; and as
   Jupiter was always attended by Mercurins, as a messenger, and Mercury
   was the god of eloquence, they conclude that Paul must be Mercury. They
   rush to the temple, they tell the priests that the gods have come down.
   The priests, only too ready to foster popular credulity, and pander to
   it, bring forth the sacred bullocks and the garlands, and are about to
   offer sacrifice before Paul and Barnabas. Such homage these men of God
   indignantly refuse; they rend their clothes; they beseech them to do no
   such thing, for they are nothing but men; yet hardly with earnest words
   can they stay the people. But the next day certain Jews came thither
   and produced a counter irritation in the simple minds of the people. No
   very difficult task where a rude fanaticism rouses the wild passions of
   the mob. Such an assembly must rage, whether it he with redundant
   applause or with derisive jeers. Accordingly, Paul finds himself
   exposed to peril; he is stoned through the streets, dragged forth as
   dead, and left by the very men who worshipped him but yesterday as a
   god, left to die as a villain outside the city gates. But Paul's
   preaching had not been in vain. There were some few disciples who
   remained faithful. His ministry was rewarded and owned of God.

   There are two or three points in this narrative to which I shall call
   your attention to-night, making, however, the lame man the center of
   the picture. We shall notice, first of all, what preceded this lame
   man's faith; secondly, wherein lay his faith to be healed; and thirdly,
   what is the teaching of the miracle itself, and the blessing which the
   lame man obtained through faith.

   I. WHAT WAS IT WHICH PRECEDED HIS FAITH?

   That "Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God," is a
   great and universal rule; but the hearing of what? Doubtless the
   hearing of the gospel is intended. On turning to your Bibles you will
   find it is written--"And there they preached the gospel." What, Paul,
   dost thou not change thy voice? Thou hast preached the gospel in the
   cities of Iconium and Antioch, where there were enlightened and
   intelligent hearers; if the gospel suited them, surely it will not do
   for these wolfish boors! Why go and preach to these poor, ignorant,
   superstitious fanatics the very same truths which you spoke to your
   enlightened Jewish brethren? But he does do so, my friends. The very
   gospel which he preached at Damascus in the synagogue he preaches here
   at Lystra in the market-place. He makes no difference between the
   education of his hearers in different places; he has the same gospel to
   preach to them both. You recollect that Paul went to Ephesus, and
   Ephesus, as a city, was besotted with a belief in sorcery. The people
   had given themselves up to practice magical arts. What is the right way
   to begin to preach at Ephesus? Deliver a course of lectures upon the
   impossibility and absurdity of such superstition? No, sir, nothing of
   the kind. Preach Christ, preach the gospel; and as Jesus Christ is
   lifted up they bring their magical books and make a bonfire of them in
   the open forum. But here is a polished governor, Sergius Paulus,
   sitting upon the judgment-seat. What shall be preached to him? Would it
   not be well to begin with a dissertation on politics, and to show that
   the Christian religion does not interfere with proper government, that
   it does not stir up the people to anarchy? No, sir, nothing of the
   kind. There is nothing for Sergius Paulus any more than there is for
   Elymas the sorcerer, but the preaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
   Paul goes to Athens. Now the Athenians are the most learned and
   philosophical of the whole race of men. What will Paul preach there?
   The gospel, the whole gospel, and nothing but the gospel. He may change
   his tones, but never his matter. It is the same remedy for the same
   disease, he the men what they may. He comes to Corinth, and here you
   have not only polished manners, but the very refinement of vice. It is
   a city, an emporium of trade, and a sort of central depot of sin. What
   then? Will he now, to please the trader, assume a different dialect?
   Not he! The Christ for Athens is the Christ for Corinth too. And now
   see him. He has come to Lycaonia, and is preaching at Lystra. Here is
   an ignorant set of people who worship an image. Why does he not begin
   by preaching of the deity? Why does he not talk to them of the Trinity
   in unity? Why does he not try and confute their notions about their
   gods? No, my dear sir, he will do nothing of the kind; that may be done
   incidentally, but the first and the last thing that Paul will do at
   Lystra is, there he will preach the gospel. O glorious gospel of the
   blessed God! Wherever we take thee thou art suited to the wants of men.
   Take thee to Persia with all its gems and jewels, and thou dost suit
   the monarch on his throne; or take thee to the naked savage with all
   his poverty and squalid filth, and thou dost suit him too. Thou mayst
   he preached, thrice glorious wisdom of God, to the wisest of men; but
   thou are not too great a mystery to be understood and believed even by
   the fools and the babes; the things which are not can receive thee as
   well as the things which are. Never, I pray you brethren, lose heart in
   the power of the gospel. Do not believe that there exists any man, much
   less any race of men, for whom the gospel is not fitted. Wherever you
   go, do not cut, and trim, and shape, and alter; hut just bring out the
   whole truth as God has taught it to you, and rest assured that you will
   be unto God a sweet savor of Christ in every place, both in them who
   are saved and in them who perish.

   What then, was this gospel which the apostle Paul did preach
   everywhere? Well, it was a gospel which had in it three things, certain
   facts, certain doctrines, and certain commands.

   It was a gospel of facts. Every time Paul stood up to preach he told
   the following unvarnished tale: God, looking upon the race of men,
   beheld them lost and ruined. Out of love to them he sent his only
   begotten Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, who was born of the virgin Mary,
   lived some thirty-two or thirty-three years a life of spotless
   innocence and perfect obedience to God. He was God: he was man. In due
   time he was delivered up by the traitor Judas. He was crucified, and
   actually put to death. Though he was the Lord of life and glory, who
   only hath immortality, yet he bowed his head and gave up the ghost.
   After three days he rose again, and showed himself to many of his
   disciples, so that they were well assured he was the same person who
   had been put into the grave; and when the forty days were finished he
   ascended up to heaven in the sight of them all, where he sitteth at the
   right hand of God, and shall also come ere long a second time to judge
   both the quick and the dead. These were the facts which Paul would
   state. God was made flesh and dwelt amongst us, and we beheld his
   glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the father, full of grace
   and truth. "This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation,
   that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am
   chief." Briefly, these were the facts which Paul would preach, and if
   any one of these facts he preached doubtfully, or he left out of any
   ministry, then the gospel is not preached; for the foundations upon
   which the gospel rests have been removed, and then what can the
   righteous do?

   Following upon these facts, Paul preached certain doctrines, the
   doctrines flowing out of the facts. To wit, he preached that Jesus
   Christ had offered a full atonement to divine wrath for the sin of his
   people, so that whosoever would believe on him, and trust him, should
   be saved. The doctrine of the atonement would form the most prominent
   feature in the gospel of the apostle Paul, Christ also hath suffered
   for us, the just for the unjust, to bring us to God. "God commendeth
   his love towards us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died
   for the ungodly." Then would come the doctrine of pardon. Paul with
   glowing tongue would tell how God could be just, and yet the justifier
   of him who believeth; how all manner of sin and iniquity shall be
   forgiven unto men, the simple condition being that the man believes in
   Christ, and this not so much the man's own work, as a gift of the Holy
   Ghost. Everywhere Paul would he unmistakable in this--"Ye chief of
   sinners, look to the wounds of Jesus, and your sins shall he forgiven
   you." Equally clear would he be upon the doctrine of justification.
   "Christ," he would say, "will wash you; nay, more, he will clothe you;
   the perfect holiness of his character shall he imputed unto you, and
   being justified, you shall have peace with God, and there shall be no
   condemnation, because you are in Christ Jesus." I think I see the
   flashing eye of the apostle; methinks I listen to his earnest voice,
   while he pleads with men to lay hold upon eternal life, to look to
   Jesus Christ, to forsake the deeds of the law, to put their trust in
   nothing which cometh from man, but to look to Jesus, and to Jesus only.
   These great truths, atonement, pardon, and justification, with all the
   other truths connected with them, of which we cannot now speak
   particularly, were just the gospel which the apostle Paul preached.

   And out of these we said their sprung certain commands. The commands
   were these--"Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved."
   Nor do I suppose that the apostle for a moment stammered to preach that
   other command--"Arise, and he baptized." He would not preach half the
   gospel, but the whole of it--"He that believeth and is baptized shall
   he saved; but he that believeth not shall he damned;" and often after
   his hearers had cried, "What must we do to he saved," and they had
   believed in Christ, they would say to him--"See, here is water, what
   doth hinder me to he baptized?"

   The apostle then preached a gospel which was made up of certain
   authenticated facts, out of which there flowed certain most gracious
   evangelical doctrines, which were enforced and driven home with divine
   authority, by Christ's own commands. "Well," says one, "do you think
   the world will be turned upside down by this?" Sirs, it has been, and
   it will he again. In vain do those who seek after human learning, and
   who aim at dreamy sentiment or spurious science in preference to the
   standard teaching which is from above, attempt to find a nobler
   instrument. This is the great battering-ram which shall yet shake the
   bastions of error. This is the sword, the true Escalabar, which, if any
   man knoweth how to wield it, shall cut through joints and marrow, and
   make him more than a conqueror. He who getteth a hold of the gospel of
   Christ, and knoweth how to use it, hath that before which the devils
   tremble, and in the presence of which angels adore, which cherubs long
   to look into, and which God himself smiles upon as his noblest work.
   The truth we proclaim is not that which is discovered by us, but that
   which has been delivered to us. Do ye ask, then, where this man's faith
   came from? It came from Paul's preaching of the gospel.

   II. Now WHEREIN LAY THIS MAN'S FAITH?

   Paul looked at the man, we are told, and perceived "that he had faith
   to be healed." What meaneth this "faith to be healed?" In this man's
   case I think it was something like this. Poor fellow! As he listened to
   Paul's preaching, he thought perhaps--"Well, that looks like true; that
   seems to be the truth; it is the truth; I am sure it is true; and, if
   it is true that Jesus Christ is so great a Savior, perhaps I may be
   healed; these lame legs of mine, which never would carry me anywhere,
   may yet come straight; I--I--I think they may; I hope they may; I
   believe they may; I know it can be done if Christ wills it; I believe
   that, and from what Paul says of Christ's character, I think he must be
   willing to do it; I will ask the apostle; the first convenient season
   that I have I will lift up my cry, for I believe it can be done, and I
   think there is a perfect willingness, both in the mind of the apostle
   and of the Master that it should be done; I believe it will be done,
   and that I shall yet stand upright." Then Paul said to him, "Stand
   upright on thy feet," and he did so in a moment, for "he had faith to
   he healed."

   Do you think I am overstraining the probabilities of the case? You will
   perhaps say, "It does not appear that Paul had any communication with
   the poor cripple before the miracle was performed." Now I venture to
   draw quite an opposite inference. I know from my own experience that it
   is no uncommon thing for some one individual to arrest the preacher's
   attention. The group of countenances which lay before him in a large
   assembly like the present, might to the first glance of a stranger look
   confused and inexplicable, as a Chinese grammar does to those who know
   not the language. But you need not doubt that a practiced eye can learn
   to read the one as well as the other. The languor and indifference of
   some; the curious enquiring look of others; the cold, critical
   attention of a considerable number, and the countenances of those who
   are rather absorbed in a train of thought just awakened in their own
   minds--these have all a peculiar impressiveness, and form a picture
   which often reacts upon us, and kindles a vehement desire in our
   breasts to reach the souls of those who, for a brief hour, hang upon
   our lips. But there will sometimes be one who has faith dazzling in his
   very eyes, as they are fixed with an intentness, of which it were vain
   for me to attempt a description, seeming to drink in every word and
   every syllable of a word, till the preacher becomes as absorbed in that
   man as the man had been in the preacher. And while he pursues the
   discourse, gaining liberty at every step, till he forgets the formality
   of the pulpit in the freedom of conversation with the people, he
   perceives that at last this man has heard the very truth which meets
   his case. There is no concealing it. His features have suddenly
   relaxed. He listens still, but it is no longer with painful anxiety; a
   calm satisfaction is palpable on his face now. That soul of communion
   which is in the eye has unravelled the secret. Preacher and hearer,
   unknown to all the rest of the audience, have secretly saluted ench
   other, and met on the common ground of a vital faith. The anxious one
   feels that it can be done. And I can readily conclude that the apostle
   perceived that feeling with greater certainty than he would have done
   had the man whispered it in his ears. So have I sometimes known that
   the exhortation to believe has become from these lips a positive
   command to the struggling conscience of some one, who has been brought
   to a point where the remedy is instantly applied, and the cure
   instantly effected.

   Most unquestionably there is such a thing as faith to be saved. I do
   not know how many here may possess it; but, thank God, there are
   hundreds of you here who have faith that you are saved. That is better;
   that is the ripest faith, the faith which knows you are saved and
   rejoices in hope of the glory of God. Alas! there are others who have
   no faith at all. But it is with those who have faith, and that only
   faith to be saved, not faith that you are saved, I am more particularly
   concerned at this moment.

   Shall I describe this "faith to he saved?" for I believe that there may
   be some here who may just now stand upright on their feet; some who may
   at this time leap for joy of heart because they are saved and did not
   know it. You have "faith," but you have not fully exercised it. Now,
   you believe that Jesus Christ is God's Son? "Yes." That he has made a
   full atonement for his people? "Yes." You believe that they are his
   people who trust him? "Yes." You believe he is worthy to be trusted?
   "Yes." You have nothing else to trust to? "No, sir." You depend on
   nothing which you have ever felt, or thought, or done? "No, sir, I
   depend on nothing but Christ." And you do, after a sort of fashion,
   trust Christ. You hope that one of these days he will save you, and you
   think, and sometimes you almost know, he will. You are ready to trust
   him. You do believe he is able, you do not think he is unwilling; you
   have got faith in his ability, and you have almost got faith in his
   willingness; sometimes you half think to yourself, "I am a child of
   God." But then, there is some ugly "but" comes in. Those lame legs
   again; those lame legs again. You are still afraid. You have "faith to
   he saved," but you have not the full assurance of faith which can utter
   forth this joyous psalm, "Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust,
   and not he afraid: for the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song; he
   also is become my salvation."

   Well now, I do not know whether I have picked you out, whether I have
   given a right description of you or not. I recollect the time when I
   was in that state. I can honestly say I did not doubt Christ. I then
   partly believed that he would save me. I knew he was worthy of my
   trust, and I did trust him as far as this, that I resolved, if I did
   perish, I would perish crying to him, and that if I was east away, it
   should be clinging to the cross. I believe I had "faith to be saved,"
   and was for months in bondage, when there was no necessity that I
   should have been in bondage at all, for, when there is "faith to he
   saved," then the man only needs that gracious command--"Stand upright
   on thy feet," and forthwith he leaps out of his infirmity, and walks
   freely in the integrity of his heart.

   III. I shall not enlarge further upon this, because I want to go to THE
   SPIRITUAL TEACHING OF THE MIRACLE, AND OF THE BLESSING CONFERRED.

   Are there not many, who though they have "faith to be saved," are still
   entirely lame or painfully limping? The reasons may be different in
   different cases. Some have been so stunned by the grief which they have
   suffered on account of sin, and the frightful convictions through which
   they have passed, that while they do believe that Christ is able and
   willing to save, they cannot get a hold of the fact that they are
   saved; such is the faintness of spirit and the languishing of soul
   brought on by long despair. "Stand upright on thy feet," thou trembling
   sinner. If thou believest in Jesus, whatever thy fears may be, there is
   no cause for them. As for thy sins, they were laid on him, every one of
   them, and though thou hast been sore broken in the land of dragons,
   thus saith the Lord unto thee, "I have put away thy sin; thou shalt not
   die; I have blotted out like a cloud thy transgressions, and like a
   thick cloud thy sins." Rejoice, then, and he glad. If you do trust
   Christ, you are saved; though as yet it only looketh like faith which
   heralds the tidings of a salvation which has not yet arrived. Still, it
   is the grace of God which bringeth salvation which has enabled thee to
   believe; and he who believeth on the Son bath everlasting life. O
   receive the welcome message; spring up at the sound of the words; stand
   upright on thy feet and rejoice.

   Some are still lame, though they have faith, through ignorance. They do
   not know what being saved is. They entertain wrong expectations. They
   are trusting in Christ, but they do not feel any surprising emotions;
   they have not had any remarkable dreams, or visions, or striking
   ebullitions of excited joy, and therefore, though they have "faith to
   be saved," they have not the faith of a present salvation. They are
   waiting for something, they hardly know what, to embellish their faith,
   or to fortify it with signs and wonders. Now, poor soul, wherefore do
   you wait? These things are not necessary to salvation. In fact, the
   fewer you have of them, methinks, the better, especially of things
   which are visionary. I rather tremble for those who talk much about
   sensible evidences; they are too often the frivolities of unstable
   hearts. Beloved, though you may have never had any ecstatic joys, or
   suffered any deep depression of your spirits, if you are resting on
   Christ, it does not matter one whit what your feelings have been or
   have not been. Do you expect to have an electric shock, or to go
   through some mysterious operation? The operation is mysterious, too
   mysterious for you to discern it; but all that you have to do with is
   this--"Do I believe in Jesus? Am I simply depending upon him for
   everything?" If you do you are saved, and I pray you to believe this.
   Stand upright on your feet, and leap for joy; for whether you believe
   it or not, if you are now depending upon Christ, your sins are forgiven
   you; you are a child of God; you are an heir of heaven.

   How many, too, are kept lame because of a fear of self-deception. "I do
   trust Christ, but I am afraid lest I should deceive myself; suppose I
   were to get confidence, and it should he presumption! suppose I should
   think myself saved, and I am not!" Now, sir, if thou wert dealing with
   thyself there would be reason to be afraid of presumption, but thy
   faith hath to deal with God, who cannot deceive thee, and with Christ
   who will never tempt thee to be a deceiver. Doth not the Lord Jesus
   Christ himself tell thee that if thou believest in him thou art saved?
   Thou believest that, dost thou not? Then, soul, if thou believest on
   him, it is not presumption to say, "I am saved." Away with all that
   affectation of modesty, which some good people think to he so
   pretty--saying, "I hope;" "I trust;" but "I feel such doubts, such
   fears, and such gloomy misgivings." My dear sir, that is not humility:
   that is a vain unseemly questioning of God. The God and Father of our
   Lord Jesus Christ tells you, and he gives his own unequivocal word for
   it, that if you rest upon Christ you rest upon a rock; that if you
   believe in him you are not condemned. Is it an evidence of the
   lowliness of your heart that you suspect the veracity of God, or the
   faithfulness of his promise? Surely this were no fruit of the meekness
   of wisdom. No, beloved; it may seem too good to he true, but it is not
   too good for my God to give, though it is too good for you to receive.
   You have his word for it, that if you trust his Son to save you, and
   simply trust him, and him alone, even if the pillars of the heavens
   should shake, yet you would be saved. If the foundations of the earth
   should reel, and the whole earth should like a vision pass away, yet
   this eternal promise and oath of God must stand fast.

   Others again, cannot stand upright on their feet, because they are
   afraid that if they did begin they would go back again, and so bring
   dishonor to Christ. This would be a very proper fear if you had
   anything to do with keeping yourselves. If you had to carry yourselves
   to heaven, it would he reasonable enough for you to despair of doing
   it. Of your own impotence it is impossible you can be too deeply
   convinced. You cannot do anything whatever, but Christ gives you his
   promise to preserve you even to the end. If you believe on him you
   shall be saved. He does not say you shall he saved for a year, or for
   twenty years, and then, perhaps, he lost at last. No; but "he that
   believeth and is baptized, shall he saved." If one man who believes in
   Christ is cast away, that promise of Christ is not true. Brethren, it
   is true, and it must he true, and let its glorious truth be sweetly
   familiar with you now--if you give your soul to Christ, putting simple
   faith in his person as the Son of God, and in his work as the Mediator
   between God and man, you shall as surely see his face within the pearly
   gates of heaven as your eyes see me to-night. There may he a question
   about your seeing me, but there can be no question about Christ
   fulfilling his promise and keeping his word. Now sit down in the dust
   no longer, thou doubting, mourning, trembling sinner. With a loud voice
   I say unto thee, as Paul did, "Stand upright on thy feet." Wherefore
   dost thou mourn? There is nothing to mourn about. Thy sin is forgiven;
   thine eternal salvation is secure; a crown in heaven is provided for
   thee, and a harp of gold awaits thee. If thou believest in Jesus none
   can lay anything to thy charge. Not even the principalities of darkness
   shall be able to prevail against thee. Eternal love secures thee
   against the malice of hell. Stand upright, then, on thy feet, for if
   thou believest thou art saved, completely saved, saved in time, and for
   eternal days, saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation.

   Then possibly there is one here who cannot stand upright because of his
   many sins. Ah! while I have been talking about Christ it may be
   something has been saying in your heart, "Ah! ah! what is it? Christ
   taking men's sins, suffering in their stead? That suits me. Is God
   doing this? Ah! then he must be able to save, and I am told that
   whosoever trusteth in him shall never perish; is it so? Why, here I am;
   I who have not been in a place of worship for months, for years, I have
   strayed in here to-night, and if what this man says be true, well then
   I will even venture my soul upon it; I have got nothing, I know, but he
   says there is nothing wanted; I am not prepared to trust Christ, but he
   says there is no preparation required, and if I trust Jesus Christ just
   as I am, Christ will save me; why, I will do it; by the grace of God I
   will do it; can he save me?" Then comes in the bitter reflection--"Look
   what a sinner I have been! why, I should be ashamed to say how foully I
   have sinned; he must shut me out; I have been too great a villain, too
   gross an offender; I have cursed and sworn at such a rate; he cannot
   mean that if I trust Christ I shall be saved; 1 believe he can save me;
   I see the fitness of the plan, and the excellency of it; I believe it,
   but see what a sinner I am!" Sinner, stand upright on thy feet, for
   "all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men." Return,
   thou wanderer, return to thy Father's house! He comes to meet thee. On
   thy neck he will fall, and thou shalt be his child for ever. Only
   believe thou in his Son Jesus Christ, and though this he the first time
   thou hast ever heard his Word, I would settle mine eyes upon thee
   earnestly, and say, "Stand upright on thy feet."

   Oh! how often I do wish that somebody had come to me when I was under
   depression of mind, and had told me about the simple gospel of Jesus
   Christ. I think I should have stood upright on my feet long before I
   did, but, alas! I kept hearing about what people felt before they
   believed in Christ--very proper preaching--and I was afraid I did not
   feel it, though now I know I did. I heard a great deal about what
   Christians ought to be, and a great deal more about God's elect, what
   they are in his esteem, but I did not know whether I was one of God's
   elect, and I knew I was not what I ought to be. O for the trumpet of
   the archangel, to sound the words, "Believe and live," as loud as the
   voice which shall wake the dead in their graves! and O for the
   quickening Spirit to go with voice, as it shall go with the ringing of
   the archangel's trump, when the graves shall open, and the dead shall
   arise! Go, you who know it, and tell it everywhere, for there are
   multitudes, I doubt not, who are really seeking Christ, and who have
   his Spirit in them, but it is like as the prophet hath it, "The
   children have come to the birth and there is no strength to bring
   forth." They have come to the very edge of light, and they only want
   one helping hand to bring them into noonday. They are slipping about in
   the Slough of Despond, and they are almost out of it, but they want
   just a helping hand to pull them out. This hand of help is stretched
   out by thus telling them, telling them plainly, it is in Jesus their
   help is found, and that trusting him, relying upon him, they shall
   never perish. neither shall any pluck them out of his hand.

   I would to God that some of you, who have been long hearing me, might
   be found in this class. I have been bowed down in spirit at some sad
   things which have been brought to my hearing of late. I know that there
   are some here, and there always have been some few attending my
   ministry, who have a personal affection for me, and who listen to the
   Word with very great attention, and who, moreover, are very greatly
   moved by it, but who have some besetting sin which they either cannot
   or will not give up. They do renounce it for a time, but either bad
   associates, or else the strength of their passions, take them away
   again. O sirs! I would ye would take warning. There was one of whom we
   had some sort of hope, who listened to our ministry. There came a
   turning point with him; it was this, either that he must give up sin,
   or else give up coming to the Tabernacle; and what--oh! what became of
   him? I could indicate the place where he sat. He died of delirium
   tremens! And I do not wonder. When you have heard the gospel preached
   Sabbath after Sabbath, when your response to the solemn appeals you
   have earnestly listened to has only been that you reject Christ and
   refuse eternal life--is it any marvel that in making the choice of your
   own damnation reason should resign its seat as director of your
   actions, and cease to curb your headstrong will, leaving the maddened
   passions to dash on with reckless fury, and precipitate your
   destruction. Am I clear of their blood? I have asked myself the
   question. I may not be in some things, but I know I am as far as my
   ministry is concerned. I have not shunned to declare unto any of you
   the whole counsel of God. When I have known any vice, or any
   folly--which of you have I been afraid of, or before whom of you all
   have I trembled? God is my witness; him have I served in the spirit;
   and if these turn aside unto their crooked ways, they have not done it
   without well knowing the consequences; nay, they have not done it
   without being warned and entreated, and persuaded to look unto Jesus
   Christ. And I do conjure some of you--you know to whom I refer--I do
   conjure those of you who have a conscience which is not seared, but
   who, nevertheless, persevere in your sins--I conjure you by the love of
   God, do me this one favor at the last: if you choose your own ruin,
   bear witness for me that I have not hesitated to warn you of it. I had
   infinitely rather, however, that you would do yourselves this great
   favor, to love your own souls. If you have anything to throw into the
   fire, throw it in, but let it not be your soul. If you have anything to
   lose, go and lose it, but do not lose your soul. Sirs, if you must play
   the fool, indulge your sport at a cheaper rate than this. If sin be
   worth having, then I pray you pay a cheaper price than your own souls
   for it, for it does seem to me so pitiful, so sorrowful a thing, that
   you who have been so short a time among us and are passing away before
   my very eyes, should still prefer the fleeting joy of the moment to the
   eternal joy, and risk everlasting torment for temporary mirth. By the
   tears of Jesus when he wept over Jerusalem, by the blood of Jesus which
   he shed for guilty men, by the heart of the eternal Father who willeth
   not the death of a sinner but had rather that he should turn unto him
   and live, I pray you he wise and consider your ways. Choose ye this day
   whom ye will serve, and may the Lord guide your choice. May you fall
   into the arms of divine mercy and say, "If thou wilt help me, Jesus,
   here I am; I give myself to thee." May my Master teach me how to
   address you if I do not know how to gasp the words of simplicity,
   tenderness, of terrible apprehension, but of persuasive power. If there
   were any words in any language that would melt you, this tongue is at
   your service to utter them. If there is any form of speech, though it
   should make me to be called vulgar, and subject me to the shame and
   hissing which once I endured, if the furnace could be heated seven
   times hotter than that, I would but laugh at it if I might but win your
   souls. Tell me, sirs, how shall I put the case? Would you have
   argument? I wish that I could reason with you. Would you have tears?
   There, let them flow! Ye dry eyes, why do ye not weep more for these
   perishing souls? Would you have God's Word without my word? Sirs, I
   would read it, and let my tongue he dumb if that would teach you. Would
   my death save you? That God who seeth in secret knoweth that to-night
   it were a joy to me to enter into my rest, and so it were little for me
   to talk of being willing to give a life for you, and it were, indeed,
   but a trifle to me. Oh! why will ye perish? Why should I plead with
   you, and you not care for yourselves? What is it that besets you? Poor
   moths! Are ye dazzled with the flames? Are ye not content to have
   singed your wings? Must they also consume body and soul? How can ye
   make your bed in hell? How can ye abide with eternal burnings? In the
   name of Jesus of Nazareth, I command you--for I can do no less--I
   command you to turn unto him and live. Believe on him and you shall he
   saved. But remember, at your hazard you reject the message to-night. It
   may he the last message that shall ever come to your soul with power,
   if ye cast this away--

   "What chains of vengeance must they feel,

   Who slight the bonds of love?"

   I would have you saved just now. I cannot talk about to-morrow. I would
   have you decide it at once. Oh! you have come as far as this twenty
   times, and have you gone back again? You have been aroused, you have
   made vows and you have broken them, resolutions and you have belied
   them. O sirs, for God's sake do not lie to the Almighty again. Now be
   true this time. May the Spirit of God make you speak the truth, even
   though you should he compelled to say, through your wickedness, "I will
   not submit myself unto the Son of God." Do speak the truth.
   Procrastinate not. As Elijah said, "How long halt ye between two
   opinions?" so say I. If God he God serve him, but if Baal he God serve
   him. But do not keep on coming here and then going to the pot-house. Do
   not come and take your seat here and then go to the brothel. Sirs, do
   not this foul scandal for God's sake, and for your own sake. If you
   will serve the devil serve him, and he a true servant to him. If you
   mean to go to hell, go there; but if you seek eternal life and joys to
   come, give up these things. Renounce them. Why drink poison and drink
   medicine too? Have done with one or the other and be honest. Be honest
   to your own souls. May the Lord grant that tonight some may have given
   to them, not only "faith to be saved," but the faith which saves, for
   his name's sake. Amen.

                   Christ is Glorious--Let Us Make Him Known

   A Sermon

   (No. 560)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, March 20th, 1864, by the

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the Lord, in the
   majesty of the name of the Lord his God; and they shall abide: for now
   shall he be great unto the ends of the earth."--Micah 5:4.

   YOU HAVE A VERY VIVID IDEA of the sufferings of Christ. Your faith has
   seen him sweating great drops of blood in the garden of Gethsemane. You
   have looked on with amazement while he gave his back to the smiters,
   and his cheeks to them who plucked off the hair, and hid not his face
   from shame and spitting. With sorrowful sympathy you have followed him
   through the streets of Jerusalem, weeping and bewailing him with the
   women. You have sat down to watch him when he was fastened to the tree;
   yon have wept at his hitter complaint--"My God, my God, why hast thou
   forsaken me?" and you have rejoiced in his shout of victory--"It is
   finished!" With Magdalene and Nicodemus, you have followed his dead
   body to the tomb, and seen it wrapped about with spices, and left to
   its lonely sleep. Are your perceptions quite as keen concerning the
   glory which did follow and is following? Can you see him quite as
   distinctly when on the third morn the Conqueror rises, bursting the
   bonds of death with which he could not be holden? Can yon as clearly
   view him ascending up on high, leading captivity captive? Can you hear
   the ring of angelic clarions, as with dyed garments from Bozrah the
   Yictor returns from the battle, dragging death and hell at his chariot
   wheels? Do you plainly perceive him as he takes his seat at the right
   hand of the Father, henceforth expecting until his enemies be made his
   footstool? And can you be as clear this morning about the reigning
   Christ as you have been about the suffering Christ? Lo! my brethren,
   "the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to
   open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof!" At this hour he
   goeth forth, riding upon his white horse, conquering and to conquer.
   Lo! at his girdle swing the keys of heaven, and death, and hell, for
   "the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be
   called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, T he everlasting Father,
   The Prince of Peace." "God also hath highly exalted him, and given him
   a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee
   should bow." Behold him, my brethren, in his present plenitude of
   glory, and endeavor to get as clear a perception of it as you have had
   of his shame. Not only weep at his burial, but rejoice at his
   resurrection; not only sorrow at his cross, but worship at his throne.
   Do not merely think of the nails and of the spear, but behold the
   imperial purple which hangs so nobly upon his royal shoulders, and of
   the divine crown which he wears upon his majestic brow.

   I want to conduct you in such a frame of mind through the glories of my
   text. First, bidding you observe the perpetual reign of Christ: "He
   shall stand and feed in the strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the
   name of the Lord his God;" then I shall beg you to observe that flowing
   from this is the perpetual continuance of his church: "and they shall
   abide;" and then proceeding both from his continued reign and from the
   Church's consequent perpetual existence comes the greatness of our
   King: "for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth."

   I. At the outset, observe carefully THE PERPETUAL REIGN OF CHRIST. He
   lives, he reigns, he is king over his people.

   Notice first, that his reign is shepherd-like in its nature. The kings
   of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, but our Master washed his
   disciples' feet. Earthly monarchs are often tyrants; their yoke is
   heavy, and their language domineering; but it is not so with our King;
   his yoke is easy, and his burden is light, for he is meek and lowly of
   heart. He is a shepherd-king. He has supremacy, but it is the
   superiority of a wise and tender shepherd over his needy and loving
   flock; he commands and receives obedience, but it is the willing
   obedience of the well-cared-for sheep, rendered joyfully to their
   beloved Shepherd, whose voice they know so well. He rules by the force
   of love and the energy of goodness. His power lies not in imperious
   threatenings, but in imperial lovingkindness. Let the children of Zion
   he joyful in their King, for "men shall be blessed in him: all nations
   shall call him blessed." Never people had such a king before. His
   service is perfect freedom; to be his subject is to be a king; to serve
   him is to reign. Blessed are the people who are the sheep of his
   pasture; if they follow in his footsteps their road is safe; if they
   sleep at his feet no lion can disturb their peace; if they are fed from
   his hand they shall lie down in green pastures, and know no lack; if
   they abide close to his person they shall drink of rivers of delight.
   Righteousness and peace are the stability of his throne, joy and
   gladness are the ornaments of his reign. Oh! how happy are we who
   belong to such a prince. Thou King in Jeshurun, we pay thee homage with
   loyal hearts; we come into thy presence with thanksgiving, and into thy
   courts with praise, for thou art our God, and we are the people of thy
   pasture, and the sheep of thy hand.

   Notice that the reign of Jesus is practical in its character. It is
   said "he shall stand and feed." The great Head of the Church is
   actively engaged in providing for his people. He does not sit down upon
   the throne in empty state, or hold a scepter without wielding it in
   government. No, he stands and feeds. The expression "feed," in the
   original is like an analogous one in the Greek, which means to
   shepherdize, to do everything expected of a shepherd: to guide, to
   watch, to preserve, to tend, as well as to feed. Our Lord Jesus Christ,
   the great Head of the Church, is always actively engaged for the
   Church's good. Through him the Spirit of God constantly descends upon
   the members of the Church; by him ministers are given in due season,
   and all Church-officers in their proper place. When he ascended up on
   high he received gifts for men; "And he gave some, apostles; and some,
   prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for
   the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the
   edifying of the body of Christ." Our Lord does not close his eyes to
   the state of his Church. Beloved, he is not a listless spectator of our
   wants. He is this day standing and feeding his people. They are
   scattered, I know, wide as the poles asunder, but our mighty Shepherd
   can see every sheep and lamb of his flock, and he gives them all their
   portion of meat in due season. He it is that like a mighty Breaker,
   goes forth at the head of his flock, and they follow where he clears
   the way, "He shall stand and feed." Oh! blessed carefulness and divine
   activity of our gracious King! always fighting against our enemies, and
   at the same the shedding his benignant influences upon his friends.

   Consider again, for it is in our text, that this active reign is
   continual in its duration. It is said, "He shall stand and feed;" not "
   he shall feed now and then, and then leave his position;" not, "he
   shall one day grant a revival, and then next day leave his Church to
   barrenness." Beloved, there is no such pastor as Christ. "I know my
   sheep," he can say, in a very high and peculiar sense. He knows them
   through and through; he feels with them; in all their afflictions he is
   afflicted; he is one with them eternally. There is no such wakeful
   watchman as the Lord Jesus. Is it not written, "I the Lord do keep it;
   I will water it every moment: lest any hurt it, I will keep it night
   and day." Those eyes never slumber, and those hands never rest; that
   heart never ceases to beat with love, and those shoulders are never
   weary of carrying his people's burdens. The Church may go through her
   dark ages, but Christ is with her in the midnight. She may pass through
   her fiery furnace, but Christ is in the midst of the flame with her.
   Her whole history through, wherever you find the Church, there shall
   you find the Church's Lord. The head is never severed from the body,
   nor is the watchful care of this gracious husband towards his spouse
   suspended for an instant.

   I beseech you labor to realize the noble picture. Here are his sheep in
   these pastures this morning, and here is our great Shepherd with the
   crown upon his head, standing and feeding us all; nay, not us all
   alone, but dispensing his tender mercies to all the multitudes of his
   elect throughout the whole world. He is at this moment King in Zion,
   ruling, and overruling, present everywhere, and everywhere showing
   himself strong in the defense of his saints. I would that our Churches
   could be more influenced by a belief in the abiding power, presence,
   and pre-eminence of their living and reigning Lord. He is no dead King
   whose memory we are bidden to embalm, but a living Leader and Commander
   whose behests we must obey, whose honor we must defend.

   Do not fail to discern that the empire of Christ in his Church is
   effectually powerful in its action; "He shall feed in the strength of
   Jehovah." Wherever Christ is, there is God; and whatever Christ does is
   the act of the Most High. Oh! it is a joyful truth to consider that he
   who redeemed us was none other than God himself, he who led oar
   captivity captive was Jehovah-Jesus; he who stands to-day representing
   the interests of his people is very God of very God, he who has sworn
   that every one of his people whom he hath redeemed by blood shall be
   brought safe to his Father's right hand, is himself essential Deity. O
   my brethren, we rest upon a sure foundation when we build upon the
   Incarnate God; and O ye saints of God, the interests of each one of
   you, and of the one great Church, must be safe, because our champion is
   God; Jehovah is our Judge, Jehovah is our Lawgiver, Jehovah is our
   King, he will save us. How can he fail or be discouraged? When he
   maketh bare his arm, who shall stand against him? Let us rehearse the
   mighty deeds of the Lord and tell of his wonders of old. Remember how
   he got him victory upon Pharaoh and the pride of Egypt! Pharaoh said,
   "Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go?" Ten
   plagues of terrible majesty taught the boaster that the Lord was not to
   be despised, and the humbled tyrant bade the people go their way. With
   a high hand and an outstretched arm did the Lord bring forth his people
   from the house of bondage. When the proud high stomach of Egypt's king
   again rose against the Most High, the Lord knew how to lay his
   adversary lower than the dust. Methinks I see the hosts of Mizraim,
   with their horses and their chariots, hurrying after the Lord's
   fugitives. Their mouths are foaming with rage. "The enemy said, I will
   pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be
   satisfied upon them." See how they ride in all their pompous glory,
   swallowing the earth in their fury. O Israel, where shall be thy
   defense? How shalt thou escape from thy tyrannic master? Be still, O ye
   seed of Jacob; ye sons of Abraham, rest ye patiently, for these
   Egyptians whom ye see to-day, ye shall see no more for ever. With their
   horses and their chariots the fierce foemen descended into the depths
   of the sea, but the Lord looked upon them, and troubled them. "Thou
   didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in
   the mighty waters." The depths have covered them; they sank into the
   bottom like a stone. "Let us sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed
   gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea."
   Surely it shall be so at the last with Jesus our King, and all his
   saints; we also shall sing "the song of Moses, the servant of God, and
   of the Lamb," in that day when the arch-enemy shall be overthrown, and
   the hosts of evil shall be consumed, and they who hate the Lord shall
   become as the fat of rams, into smoke shall they consume, yea, into
   smoke shall they consume away.

   One other word remains; our Lord's kingdom is most majestic in its
   aspect. You will observe it is written by the prophet--"He shall feed
   in the majesty of the name of the Lord his God." Jesus Christ is
   greatly to be reverenced; the familiarity with which we approach him is
   always to be tempered with the deepest and most reverent adoration. He
   is our brother, bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh, but still he
   counteth it not robbery to be equal with God. I know he made himself of
   no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and he calleth
   himself to-day our husband, and maketh us to be members of his body, of
   his flesh, and of his bones; but yet we must never forget that it is
   written, "Let all the angels of God worship him," and "At the name of
   Jesus every knee shall bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth,
   and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that
   Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father." Yes, Christ is
   majestic in his Church. I would, brethren, we always thought of this.
   There is a glory and a majesty about all the laws of Christ, and all
   his commands, so that whether we baptize at his command, or break bread
   in remembrance of him, or lift up his cross in ministry--in whatever we
   do, in his name, which is in fact, what he does through us, there is an
   attendant majesty which should make our minds feel perpetually reverent
   before him. O that the world could see the glory of Christ in the
   Church! O that the world did but know who it is that is in the midst of
   the few, the feeble, the weak, the foolish as they call them. O
   Philistia! if thou didst but know who is our champion, thy Goliath of
   Gath would soon hide his diminished head. O Assyria, if thou didst but
   know that the ancient might of him who smote Sennacherib, still abideth
   with us, thy hosts would turn their backs and yield us an easy victory.
   There is a true and mysterious presence of Christ with his people,
   according to the promise "Lo I am with you alway, even unto the end of
   the world;" it is because the world ignores this that she despises and
   sneers at the Church of God. Therein is our comfort and our glory. We
   have a majesty about us if we be the people of God, which is not to be
   gainsayed; angels see it and wonder--a majesty of indwelling Godhead,
   for the Lord is in the midst of us for a glory and around us for a
   defense.

   II. We will now occupy one or two minutes with THE CONSEQUENT
   PERPETUITY OF THE CHURCH. Because of the unseen but most certain
   presence of Christ as King in the midst of his people, his Church
   ABIDES--so says the text. Here reflect first that a Church exists. What
   a wonder this! It is perhaps, the greatest miracle of all ages that God
   has a Church in the world. You who are conversant with human history
   will hear me out when I say that the whole history of the Church is a
   series of miracles, a long stream of wonders! A little spark kindled in
   the midst of oceans, and yet all her boisterous waves cannot quench it!
   Here is the great wonder which John saw in vision, and which history
   reveals in solemn, sober fact. A woman, "being with child, cried,
   travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered. And there appeared
   another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon . . . stood
   before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her
   child as soon as it was born." The man-child who is to rule all nations
   with a rod of iron, was brought forth and caught up to God and to his
   throne. As for the woman, the Church, she fled as on eagles' wings to
   her wilderness-shelter prepared of God, until, in great wrath, the
   dragon pursued and persecuted her. Apt enough is that metaphor, "The
   serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman that he
   might cause her to be carried away of the flood . . . And the dragon
   was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her
   seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of
   Jesus Christ." Yet, my brethren, as surely as that glorious man-child,
   the Lord Jesus, lives and sits upon the throne, so surely shall the
   woman, the poor afflicted Church, live on until the dragon's time is
   over, and the King shall reign upon the earth.

   To what trials, my brethren, has not the Church of God been subjected?
   What new invention can Satan bring forth? The fire, the rack,
   imprisonment, banishment, confiscation, slander, all these have been
   tried, and in them all the Church has been more than conqueror through
   him who loved her. False doctrine without, heresy and schism with in,
   hypocrisy, formalism, fanaticism, pretences of high spirituality,
   worldliness, these have all (lone their worst. I marvel at the wondrous
   ingenuity of the great enemy of the Church, but methinks his devices
   must nearly have come to an end. Can he invent anything further? We
   have been astounded in these ages by the prodigy of an infidel bishop;
   we have been struck dumb with sorrow and amazement at a decree which
   declares that a Church professing to be a Church of Christ must permit
   men to be her ministers who deny the inspiration of Holy Scripture.
   This is a new thing under the sun. Popery and infidelity are to be both
   legalized and fostered in a Church professing to be Christian and
   Protestant. What next? and what next? Bat what of all this? The Church,
   I mean the company of the Lord's called and faithful and chosen still
   exists; the Lord has his elect people who still hold forth the Word of
   truth, and in the most reprobate Church still he may say, "I hay e a
   few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and
   they shall walk with me in white; for they are worthy."

   Observe, the text says, "she abides," which means, not that she exists
   now and then by starts and spasms, but she exists always. This is
   wonderful! Always a Church! When the full force of the Pagan Emperors
   came like a thundering avalanche upon her, she shook off the stupendous
   load as a man shaketh the flakes of snow from his garment, and she
   lived on uninjured. When papal Rome vented its malice yet more
   furiously and ingeniously; when cruel murderers hunted the saints among
   the Alps, or worried them in the low country; when Albigenses and
   Waldenses poured out their blood in rivers, and dyed the snow with
   crimson, she lived still, and never was in a healthier state than when
   she was immersed in her own gore. When after a partial reformation in
   this country, the pretenders to religion determined that the truly
   spiritual should be harried out of the land, God's Church did not sleep
   or suspend her career of life or service. Let the covenant signed in
   blood witness to the vigor of the persecuted saints. Hearken to her
   psalm amidst the brown heath-clad hills of Scotland, and her prayer in
   the secret conventicles of England. Hear ye the voice of Cargil and
   Cameron thundering among the mountains against a false king and an
   apostate people; hear ye the testimony of Bunyan and his compeers who
   would sooner rot in dungeons than bow the knee to Baal. Ask me "Where
   is the Church?" and I can find her at any and every period from the day
   when first in the upper room the Holy Ghost came down even until now.
   In. one unbroken line our apostolic succession runs; not through the
   Church of Rome; not from the superstitious hands of priest-made popes,
   or king-created bishops, (what a varnished lie is the apostolic
   succession of those who boast so proudly of it!) but through the blood
   of good men and true, who never forsook the testimony of Jesus; through
   the loins of true pastors, laborious evangelists, faithful martyrs, and
   honorable men of God, we trace our pedigree up to the fishermen of
   Galilee and glory that we perpetuate by God's grace that true and
   faithful Church of the living God, in whom Christ did abide and will
   abide until the world's crash.

   Observe, dear friends, that in the use of the term "Abide," we have not
   only existence, and continued existence, but the idea of quiet, calm,
   uninjured duration. It does not say she lingers, hunted, tempted,
   worried, but she abides. Ohm! the calmness of the Church of God under
   the attacks of her most malicious foes. Thou crue1 adversary, the
   virgin daughter of Zion hath shaken her head at thee and laughed thee
   to scorn! She abides in peace when the world rages against her. It is
   most noteworthy how in most instances the Church of God still keeps her
   foothold where she has been most savagely persecuted. In modern times
   we find in Madagascar, after years of exterminating persecution, the
   Church of God rises from her ashes, like the phoenix from the flames.
   The chief wonder is that she abides perfect. Not one of Cod's elect has
   gone back; not one of the blood-bought has denied the faith. Not one
   single soul which ever was effectually called call be made to dolly
   Christ, even though his flesh should be pulled from his bones by hot
   pincers, or his tormented body flung to the jaws of wild beasts. All
   that the enemy has done has been of no avail against the Church. The
   old rock has been washed, and washed, and washed again by stormy waves,
   and submerged a thousand times in the floods of tempest, hut even her
   angles and corners abide unaltered and unalterable. We may say of the
   Lord's tabernacle, not one of he stakes thereof has been removed, nor
   one of her cords boom broken. The house of he Lord from foundation to
   pinnacle is perfect still: "The rain descended, and the floods came,
   and the winds blew, and beat upon that house and it fell not;" nay, nor
   a single stone of it "for it was founded upon a rock."

   But why all this, dear friends, why is it that we have seen the Church
   endure to this day? How is it that we are confident that even should
   worse times arrive, the Church would weather the storm and abide till
   moons shall cease to wax and wane? Why this security? Only because
   Christ is in the midst of her. You do not believe, I hope, in the
   preservation of orthodoxy by legal instruments and trust deeds. This is
   what too many Dissenters have relied upon. We certainly cannot depend
   upon creeds; they arc good enough in their way, as trust deeds are too,
   but they are as broken reeds if we rely upon them. We cannot depend
   upon parliament, nor kings, nor queens. We may draw up the most express
   and distinct form of doctrine, but we shall find that the next
   generation will depart from the truth unless God shall be pleased to
   give it renewed grace from on high. You cannot, by Presbytery, or
   Independency, or Episcopacy, secure the life of the Church--I find the
   Church of God has existed under an Episcopacy--a form of government not
   without its virtues and its faults. I find the Church of God flourish
   under a Presbytery, and decay under it too. I know it can be successful
   under an Independent form of Church government and can decline into
   Arianism quite as easily. The fact is that forms of government have
   very little to do with the vital principle of the Church. The reason
   why the Church of God exists is not her ecclesiastical regulations,
   11cr organization, her formularies, her ministers, or her creeds, but
   the presence of the Lord in the midst of her; and while Christ lives,
   and Christ reigns, and stands and feeds his Church, she is safe; but if
   he were once gone, it would be with her as it is with you and with me
   when the Spirit of God has departed from us, we are weak as other men,
   and she would be quite as powerless.

   III. But now, thirdly, flowing from both these, from the perpetual
   presence of Christ and from the continued existence of his Church, is
   THE GREATNESS OF OUR KING. "Now shall he be great unto the ends of the
   earth." Christ is great in his Church. Oh! how great in our hearts
   where he reigns supreme! My heart, it doth leap at the sound of his
   name--

   "Jesus, the very thought of thee,

   With rapture fills may breast."

   O for crowns! for golden crowns! Let us crown him King in Zion! O for a
   well-tuned harp, and for David's feet, to dance before the ark at the
   very mention of Jesus' name! Now shall he be great indeed in our
   hearts! But he is to be great to the ends of the earth. That is a
   promise, of which we will say it is accomplished in a measure even now.
   Christ is made great ill the conversion of every sinner. When he
   suppliant penitent cries, "God be merciful to me a sinner," and the
   peace-speaking blood comes dropping upon the troubled conscience, and
   the soul bows meekly to accept he finished righteousness, then is
   Christ great. And he is great in the consecration of every one of his
   bloodbought saints; when they live for him; when in their prayers they
   make mention of him; when they give him their heart's music, their
   life's light, and their hips' testimony; when they feel that
   tribulation is joyous if endured for him, and the sternest toil a dear
   delight when undertaken for his sake--then Christ is great. Think, my
   brethren, this morning, how many ships are now furrowing the blue sea
   in which there are hearts which love the name of Jesus. Hark! across
   the waves of the Atlantic and the Pacific I hear the sound of prayer
   and praise from many a vessel bearing the British flag. From many an
   islet of the sea the song is borne upon the breeze. And there across
   the waters in the land of our American brethren, now so sadly chastened
   with war, multitudes of hearts beat as high as ours at the mention of
   the Savior's name. Here across you narrow Channel, in Holland, in
   Sweden, in Germany, in Switzerland, and even in France and Italy, how
   many own his name and praise him this day! We speak of our Queen's
   dominions and say that the sun never sets upon them. We may in truth
   say this of our Lord Jesus; men of all colors trust in his blood; they
   who look upward to the southern cross and they who follow the Polar
   star, alike worship his dear name; and when England ceases her strain
   of joy, in the hush of night, Australia takes up the song, and so from
   land to land, and from shore to shore, a sacrifice of a pure offering
   is brought to his shrine. It is accomplished, in some degree, but oh!
   how small the degree when we think of the thick darkness which covers
   the multitude of the people.

   Again, it is a promise which is guaranteed as to its fulfillment in the
   fullest sense. Courage! brethren, courage! the night is not for ever,
   the morning cometh! Watchman, what sayest thou? Are there not streaks
   reddening the east? Hath not the God of day, the Lord Jesus, began to
   shoot his divine arrows of light upwards into the thick darkness? It is
   even so. As I think of the signs of the times, I would fondly hope that
   we shall live to see brighter and better days. "Now," says the text,
   "shall he be great unto the ends of the earth." Prophet, I would that
   thy "now" were true this day. Now, even mow, let him reign! why doth he
   tarry? Why are his chariots so long in coming? Will it be, my brethren,
   that Christ will come before the world is converted? If so, welcome
   Jesus. Or will the world be converted first? If so, thrice welcome the
   mercy. But whether or no, this we do know, he shall have dominion from
   sea to sea, and from the river even unto the ends of the earth. They
   who dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him, and his enemies shall
   lick the dust. The day shall come when the fifth great monarchy shall
   be co-extensive with the world's bounds, and everywhere the Great
   Shepherd shall reign.

   But remember, dear friends, that while this promise is thus guaranteed
   as to its fulfillment, it is to be prayed for as to its accomplishment.
   "I will yet for this be enquired of by the house of Israel, to do it
   for them." The mountain of the Lord shall be in the latter days, but
   mark you, though there be no sound of trowel or a hammer, there will be
   heard be sound of prayer and praise, as upward the mountain of Cod's
   house shall ascend. You know the picture. The prophet had seen the
   Lord's house standing, as it were, in a valley, and as he looked upon
   it, presently it became a little hill; the ground began to heave;
   by-and-by it had swollen from a little hill into a lofty mountain, and
   up it rose, and grew more great before his eyes, till Alps were dwarfed
   and Himalayas were stunted, and up it still went, not the house only,
   but the mountain too, till infinitely higher than the projected tower
   of Babel, which man meant to be the world's center, this house stood
   out clear and sharp above the clouds, having pinnacles high up in God's
   heaven, and yet deep foundations in man's earth, and all nations began
   to flow to it as to the great center. What a dream! What a vision! Yet
   such shall it be. The Church is as it were, in a plain just now, she
   begins to misc. Oh! stupendous movement! she begins to rise, her
   mountains swell and grow; she attracts observers; she cannot he held
   down. Who can attempt to restrain the swelling mass? Who shall prevent
   the gigantic birth? Up rises the mountain, as though swollen by some
   inward fire, anti up it swells, and swells, and swells, till earth
   touches heaven, and God communes with men. Then shah be heard the great
   hallelujah, "The tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with
   them."

   But then, and this is the conclusion, and I hope God may help me to
   press it on your hearts. All this is to be labored for as well as
   prayed after. My soul pants and pines to see Christ glorious in the
   eyes of men. Lives there a Christian here with soul so dead that he
   does not desire the extension of his Master's kingdom? Sirs, is there
   one among you who counts it little to see Jesus Christ lifted up in
   men's hearts? I know I speak to a people--and the Lord knoweth it to
   many of whom Christ is he dearest of all which is beloved, the fairest
   among ten thousand, and the altogether lovely. Now, if Christ is to be
   glorified, he must be glorified by you; if his kingdom is to come, it
   must come through you. God works, but God works by means. He worketh in
   you "to will and to do of his own good pleasure." Souls are to be
   saved, but they are not saved without instruments. The feast is to be
   furnished with guests, but you are to go into the highways and hedges,
   and compel them to come in. I know my Master is to have many crowns,
   but they are to be crowns for which you grace, and which you have
   fought, which you have won through his you place at his feet, that he
   may honor you by wearing them upon his brow. Now we, as a people, have
   been greatly blessed and helped of God, and I believe the Master has a
   very high claim upon us. We, above all the Churches in the world are
   indebted to the grace and mercy of God, and we ought to be doing
   something for the extension of the Savior's kingdom. We cannot boast of
   wealth; we cannot profess to build all over London a multitude of
   Churches as the Bishop hopes to do. Any scheme of raising three
   millions of money by us, must be looked upon as being entirely a dream;
   we cannot attempt such a. thing; if London is to be converted by money
   we must give up the task. We have no mitred bishops, no queens to
   subscribe, and no nobles and dukes, and the like to add their thousands
   and their tens of thousands of pounds. We are a feeble folk; what then
   can we do for Cod? Why, do as much as the strong! What call we do for
   God? Do as munch as the mighty! Nay, my brethren, our very weakness and
   want of power shah be our adaptation to Cod's work; and he who often
   putteth by the sword of Saul, and the armor of the son of Kish, will
   use David, and his sling and his stone, and smite Goliath's brow
   therewith.

   I have been musing all this week upon that celebrated scene in ancient
   history, which seems to me to be so much like the state of our Church
   just now; the story of Gideon, the son of Joash, threshing wheat in the
   winepress, because he was afraid to be seen; the Midianites having
   spoiled the land. Now we, as Baptists, have generally been too much
   afraid to be seen; we have threshed our corn somewhere away in the
   winepress--up a back court--down a narrow street; any dirty hole would
   do to build a chapel in; so long as people could not find it tine site
   was thought advantageous; and if nobody could ever see it that was the
   place for our fathers, and for some who still linger among us. It was
   threshing wheat in the winepress, to hide it from the enemy. Well now,
   I think the time has come that we should not be afraid of these
   Midianites any longer. Long has he Church of God been oppressed and
   kept back; she has been content to let the world devour liner increase.
   There have been few additions to the Churches; they remain very much
   what they were twenty or thirty years ago; but, my brethren, some of us
   think that we have seen our fleece wet with dew, while all around was
   dry; and we believe the Lord has said to us, "The Lord is with thee,
   thou mighty man of valor." We think we have had the Lord's commission,
   "Go in this thy strength." We do not expect all of you to go with us,
   for the people are too many. We expect that there are many of the
   trembling and faint-hearted who will step back from the battle; men who
   are look ill for their families, mind must provide for them; men who
   are saving up money, and grudge their sovereigns, and so on--these of
   course will stand back, and let them; such men encumber our march. We
   fear that you are not all men who lap; but we have a few who care ery
   little for the ease and repose of life, but who snatch a hasty draught
   as they run, and with heat, and zeal, and passionate earnestness run to
   meet the adversary. Now, these we expect to go with us to the fray. In
   the name of the Lord, I proclaim a new crusade against the sin and vice
   of this huge city. What are we to do? The hosts of Midian are to be
   counted by millions. Here in this great city we have three millions of
   people, and what if I were to say, two-and-half millions of them do not
   know their right hand from their left in matters of religion, I believe
   I should speak too charitably; for if I could believe there were half a
   million of true believers in London, I should have vastly greater hopes
   of it than I have now. But, alas! that is not the case. Millions,
   millions are gathered in he valley of indecision who are not upon the
   Lord's side. What can you and I do? We can do nothing of ourselves, but
   we can do everything by he help of our God. Where Christ is there is
   might and where God is there is strength; let us therefore in God's
   name determine to plant new Churches wherever openings occur. Like
   Gideon's men let us rally under our Church-officers, and follow where a
   warm heart leads the way. Gideon took his men, and bade them do two
   things; covering up a torch in an earthen pitcher, he bade them, at an
   appointed signal, break tine pitcher and let the light shine, and then
   sound with their trumpets, crying, "The sword of the Lord and of
   Gideon! the sword of he Lord and of Gideon!" This is just what all
   Christians must do. First, you must shine; break the pitcher which
   conceals you; throw aside the bushel which has been hiding your candle,
   and shine. Let your light shine before men; let your good works be
   such, that when they look upon you, they shall know that you have been
   with Jesus. There is much good done by the shining. Then there must be
   the sound, the blowing of the trumpet. O dear friends, the great mass
   of London will never hear r the gospel, unless you go and blow the
   trumpet in their ears. Many who are members of this Church never heard
   a gospel sermon, until they heard some of you preaching in the street.
   "Why," said one "I never went to a place of worship; but I went down a
   street, and there stood a young man at the corner; I listened to him,
   and God was pleased to send tine arrow to my conscience, and I came
   into the house of God afterwards." Take the gospel to them; carry it to
   their door; put it in their way; do not suffer them to escape it; blow
   the trumpet right against their ears. In the name of God, I pray you do
   this. Remember that the true war cry of the Church is Gideon's war-cry,
   "The sword of the Lord!" God must do it, it is God's work. But we are
   not to be idle; instrumentality is to be used--"The sword of the Lord
   and of Gideon!" Mark you, if we only cry, "The sword of the Lord!" we
   shall be guilty of an idle presumption, and shall be tempting God to
   depart from his fixed rule of procedure. This is the cry of every, lazy
   lie-n-bed. What good ever comes of saying, "The Lord will do his own
   work, let us sit still?" Nor must it be "The sword of Gideon" alone,
   for that were idolatrous reliance on an arm of flesh; we can do nothing
   of ourselves. Not "The sword of the Lord" only, that were idleness; but
   the two together, "The sword of the Lord and of Gideon." O my brethren,
   God help you to learn this lesson well, and then you will go forth
   shining and sounding, living and teaching, testifying and living out
   the truth? Ye shall most assuredly make the kingdom of Christ to come,
   and his name shall be honored if you will do this. It seems to me that
   now is a glorious opportunity. There is a spirit of hearing upon the
   people. Almost anyone may get a hearing who is willing to preach
   Christ. Now or never! Sons of Jacob! Ye are to be like a lion among the
   flock of sheep, and will ye lie down and slumber? Up and every man to
   the prey! Sons of Jacob! ye are to be as dew upon the grass, and will
   ye tarry for men and wait for the sons of men? No. In God's name, go
   forward, and let something be done for God, and for his Christ, for a
   perishing age, for a dark world, for heaven's glory, and for hell's
   defeat. Up! ye who know the Lord; ye swordsmen of our Israel, up and at
   them, and God give you a great victory and deliverance!

   I want you to make some practical point of these things to-day. God has
   been pleased to put a sword into my hand, and to give me my lamp and my
   pitcher; my College of young men is now become in the Lord's hands a
   marvellous power for good. A blessing greater than I could have
   expected rests on this work. We are continually sending them out, and
   God owns them in the conversion of souls. I have never seen any agency
   more blessed to the conversion of souls, than the agency of our
   College. Without saying anything to depreciate other efforts, I do
   believe God has conferred on our Institution a crowning and special
   blessing, and will continue to do so yet more and more. I want you all,
   both hearers and readers of my sermons, to feel that this is your work,
   and to help me in it while I continue to cry, "The sword of the Lord
   and of Gideon! God works, and therefore we work; God is with us, and
   therefore we are with God, and stand on his side. Inasmuch as many of
   these men raise Churches, we want you to help to build the places where
   the new congregations can be accommodated afterwards; and to that end
   we have striven to raise a fund of five thousand pounds, to be lent out
   to these new Churches on loan to be repaid by installments without
   interest. It is but a small sum, but it is as much as I think we can
   do, and frugal care will turn it to good account. Some three thousand
   pounds have been promised by our seven shepherds and principal men; but
   there are many who have not promised anything yet, and we shall be glad
   if they will come forward, for otherwise this useful fund cannot be
   raised. When this is done with, once for all, we will go on and do
   something else for Jesus. Do break this pitcher; get this done, and let
   tine light of this thing shine. We must be doing something for God. I
   speak to you now upon the practical point, and come to it at once. If
   you are content to live without serving God, I am not; and if you are
   willing to let these hours roll by without doing something to extend
   the kingdom of Jesus, let me be gone from you; let me be gone from you
   to those of warmer spirits and of holier aspirations, for I must fight
   for God! there must be victories won for him! We must extend the range
   of the gospel; we must find places where souls can be brought to hear
   the Word. Hell shall not for ever laugh at our inactivity, and heaven
   shall not eternally weep at our sloth! Let us be up and doing, and let
   this thing be done by the mainly, the few have already done their
   parts. Promises reaching over five years are asked of you, you can all
   do something. And then, every one of you, when you have done your share
   in this, go out personally and serve with your flaming torch of holy
   example, and with your trumpet tones of earnest declaration and
   testimony serve your Lord, and God shall be with you, and Midian shall
   be put to confusion, and the Lord of hosts shall reign for ever and
   ever. "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that
   believeth not shall be damned." Hear ye that note, O dead souls, and
   live.

                                   Expiation

   A Sermon

   (No. 561)

   By the

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "Thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin."--Isaiah 53:10.

   BOTH Jews and Gentiles knew pretty well what an offering for sin meant.
   The Gentiles had been in the habit of offering sacrifices. The Jews,
   however, had by far the clearer idea of it. And what was meant by a
   sin-offering? Undoubtedly, it was taken for granted by the offerer,
   that without shedding blood there was no remission of sin. Conscious of
   guilt, and anxious for pardon, therefore he brought a sacrifice, the
   blood of which should be poured out at the foot of the altar--feeling
   persuaded that without sacrifice there was no satisfaction, and without
   satisfaction there was no pardon. Then the victim to be offered was, on
   all occasions, a spotless one. The most scrupulous care was taken that
   it should be altogether without blemish; for this idea was always
   connected with a sin-offering, that it must be sinless in itself; and
   being without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, it was held to be a
   competent victim to take the offender's place. That done, the victim
   being selected, the offerer put his hand upon the sin-offering--and
   this indeed was the essence of the whole transaction--putting his hand
   on the victim, he confessed his sin, and a transferrence took place, in
   type at least, from the offender to the victim. He did, as it were, put
   the sin from off his own shoulders on to those of the lamb, or the
   bullock, or the he-goat which was now about to be slaughtered. And, to
   complete the sin-offering, the priest draws his knife and kills the
   victim which must be utterly consumed with fire. I say this was always
   the idea of a sin-offering,--that of a perfect victim; without offense
   on its own account, taking the place of the offender; the transferrence
   of the offender's sin to that victim, and that expiation in the person
   of the victim for the sin done by another.

   Now, Jesus Christ has been made by God an offering for sin; and oh that
   to-night we may be able to do in reality what the Jew did in metaphor!
   May we put our hand upon the head of Christ Jesus; as we see him
   offered up upon the cross for guilty men, may we know that our sins are
   transferred to him, and may we be able to cry, in the ecstasy of faith,
   "Great God, I am clean; through Jesus' blood I am clean."

   I. In trying now to expound the doctrine of Christ's being an offering
   for sin, we will begin by laying down one great axiom; which is, that
   SIN DESERVES AND DEMANDS PUNISHMENT.

   Certain divines have demurred to this. You are aware, I suppose, that
   there have been many theories of atonement; and every new or different
   theory of atonement involves a new or different theory of sin. There
   are some who say that there is no reason in sin itself why it should be
   punished, but that God punishes offenses for the sake of society at
   large. This is what is called the governmental theory,--that it is
   necessary for the maintenance of good order that an offender should be
   punished, but that there is nothing in sin itself which absolutely
   requires a penalty. Now, we begin by opposing all this, and asserting,
   and we believe we have God's warrant of it, that sin intrinsically and
   in itself demands and deserves the just anger of God, and that that
   anger should be displayed in the form of a punishment. To establish
   this, let me appeal to the conscience--I will not say to the conscience
   of a man who has, by years of sin, dwindled it down to the very lowest
   degree, but let me appeal to the conscience of an awakened sinner,--a
   sinner under the influence of the Holy Spirit. And are we ever in our
   right senses, brethren, till the Holy Spirit really brings us into
   them? May it not be said of each of us as it was of the prodigal, "He
   came to himself?" Are we not beside ourselves till the Holy Spirit
   begins to enlighten us? Well, ask this man, who is now really in the
   possession of his true senses, whether he believes that sin deserves
   punishment; and his answer will be quick, sharp, and decisive. "Deserve
   it," saith he, "ay, indeed; and the wonder is that I have not suffered
   it. Why, sir, it seems a marvel to me that I am out of hell, and
   Wesley's hymn is often on my lips,--

   'Tell it unto sinners, tell,

   I am, I am out of hell.'"

   "Yes, sir," says such a sinner, "I feel that if God should smite me
   now, without hope or offer of mercy, to the lowest hell, I should only
   have what I justly deserve; and I feel that if I be not punished for my
   sins, or if there be not some plan found by which my sin can be
   punished in another, I cannot understand how God can be just at all:
   how shall he be Judge of all the earth, if he suffer offenses to go
   unpunished?" There has been a dispute whether men have any innate
   ideas, but surely this idea is in us as early as anything, that virtue
   deserves reward, and sin deserves punishment. I think I might venture
   to assert that if you go to the most degraded race of men, you would
   still find, at least, some traces of this--shall I call it tradition?
   or is it not a part of the natural light which never was altogether
   eclipsed in man? Man may put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter;
   darkness for light, and light for darkness; but this follows him as a
   dog at the heels of its master,--a sense that virtue should be
   rewarded, and that sin must be punished. You may stifle this voice, if
   you will, but sometimes you will hear it; and terribly and decisively
   will it speak in your ears to say to you, "Yes, man, God must punish
   you; the Judge of all the earth cannot suffer you to go scot free." Add
   to this another matter; namely, that God has absolutely declared his
   displeasure against sin itself. There is a passage in Jeremiah, the
   forty-fourth chapter and the fourth verse, where he calls it "That
   abominable thing which I hate." And then, in Deuteronomy, the
   twenty-fifth chapter, at the sixteenth verse, he speaks of it as the
   thing which is an abomination to him. It must be the character of God,
   that he has a desire to do towards his creatures that which is
   equitable. "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?" If there is
   anything in them which deserves reward, rest assured he will not rob
   them of it; and, on the other hand, he will do the right thing with
   those who have offended, and if they deserve punishment, it is
   according to the nature and character of a just and holy God that
   punishment should be inflicted. And we think there is nothing more
   clear in Scripture than the truth that sin is in itself so detestable
   to God that he must and will put forth all the vigor of his tremendous
   strength to crush it, and to make the offender feel that it is an evil
   and a bitter thing to offend against the Most High. Beware, ye who
   forget God in this matter, lest he tear you in pieces, and there be
   none to deliver you. Sin must be punished.

   The other idea, that sin is only to be punished for the sake of the
   community, involves injustice. If I am to be damned for the sake of
   other people, I demur to it. No, sir: if I am to be punished, Justice
   says; at any rate, that it shall be for my own sins, but if I am to be
   eternally a castaway from God's presence merely as a sort of trick of
   government to maintain the dignity of his law, I cannot understand the
   justice of this. If I am to be cast into hell merely that I am to teach
   to others the tremendousness of the divine holiness, I shall say there
   is no justice in this; but if my sin intrinsically and of itself
   deserves the wrath of God, and I am sent to perdition as the result of
   this fact, I close my lips, and have nothing to say. I am speechless;
   conscience binds my tongue. But if I am told that I am only sent there
   as a part of a scheme of moral government, and that I am sent into
   torment to impress others with a sense of right, I ask that some one
   else should have the place of preacher to the people, and that I may be
   one of those whose felicity it shall be to be preached to; for I see no
   reason in justice why I should be selected as the victim. Really, when
   men run away from the simplicities of the gospel in order to make
   Jehovah more kind, it is strange how unjust and unkind they make him.
   Sinner, God will never destroy you merely to maintain his government,
   or for the good of others. If you be destroyed, it shall be because you
   would not come to him that you might have life; because you would rebel
   against him; because sin from stern necessity did, as it were, compel
   the attribute of divine justice to kindle into vengeance, and to drive
   you from his presence for ever. Sin must be punished.

   The reverse of this doctrine, that sin demands punishment, may be used
   to prove it; for it is highly immoral, dangerous, and opens the
   floodgates of licentiousness to teach that sin can go unpunished. O
   sirs, it is contrary to fact. Look ye! Oh! if your eyes could see
   to-night the terrible justice of God which a being executed now,--if
   these ears could but hear it,--if ye could be appalled for a moment
   with

   " The sullen groans and hollow moans

   And shrieks of tortured ghosts,"

   you would soon perceive that God is punishing sin! And if sin deserve
   not to be punished, what is Tophet but injustice on a monstrous scale?
   What is it but an infinite outrage against everything which is honest
   and right, if these creatures are punished for anything short of their
   own deserts. Go and preach this in hell, and you will have quenched the
   fire which is forever to burn, and the worm of conscience will die.
   Tell them in hell that they are not punished for sin, and you have
   taken away the very sting of their punishment. And then come to earth,
   and go, like Jonah went, though with another message than Jonah
   carried, through the highways and the broadways, the streets and
   thoroughfares of the exceeding great city, and proclaim that sin is not
   to be punished for its own intrinsic desert and baseness. But if you
   expect your prophecy to be believed, enlarge the number of your jails,
   and seek for fresh fields for transportation in the interests of
   society; for if any doctrine can breed villains, this will. Say that
   sin is not to be punished, and you have unhinged government; you have
   plucked up the very gate of our commonweal; you have been another
   Samson to another Gaza; and we shall soon have to rue the day. But,
   sirs, I need not stop to prove it; it is written clearly upon the
   consciousness of each man, and upon the conscience of every one of us,
   that sin must be punished. Here are you and I to-night brought into
   this dilemma. We have sinned; we all like sheep have gone astray; and
   we must be punished for it. It is impossible, absolutely, that sin can
   be forgiven without a sacrifice. God must be just, if heaven falls. If
   earth should pass away and every creature should be lost, the justice
   of God must stand, it cannot by any possibility be suffered to be
   impugned. Let this, then, be fully established in our minds.

   You need not to be told, as for the first time, that God in his
   infinite mercy has devised a way by which justice can be satisfied, and
   yet mercy can be triumphant. Jesus Christ, the only begotten of the
   Father, took upon himself the form of man, and offered unto Divine
   Justice that which was accepted as an equivalent for the punishment due
   to all his people.

   II. Now, the second matter that I wish to bring under your notice is
   this,--THAT THE PROVISION AND ACCEPTANCE OF A SUBSTITUTE FOR SINNERS IS
   AN ACT OF GRACE.

   It is no act of grace for a person to accept a pecuniary debt on my
   behalf of another person. If I owe a man twenty pounds, it is no matter
   to him whatever who shall pay the twenty pounds so long as it is duly
   paid. You know that you could legally and at once demand a receipt and
   an acquittance from any one who is your creditor, so long as his debt
   is discharged, though it is discharged by another, and not by you. It
   is so in pecuniary matters, but it is not so in penal matters. If a man
   be condemned to be imprisoned, there is no law, there is no justice
   which can compel the lawgiver to accept a substitute for him. If the
   sovereign should permit another to suffer in his stead, it must be the
   sovereign's own act and deed. He must use his own discretion as to
   whether he will accept the substitute or not; and if he do so, it is an
   act of grace. In Gods case, if he had said in the infinite sovereignty
   of his absolute will, "I will have no substitute, but each man shall
   suffer for himself, he who sinneth shall die," none could have
   murmured. It was grace, and only grace which led the divine mind to
   say, "I will accept of a substitute. There shall be a vicarious
   suffering; and my vengeance shall be content, and my mercy shall be
   gratified."

   Now, dear friends, this grace of God is yet further magnified not only
   in the allowance of the principle of substitution, but in the providing
   of such a substitute as Christ--on Christ's part that he should give up
   himself, the Prince of Life to die; the King of glory to be despised
   and rejected of men; the Lord of angels to be a servant of servants;
   and the Ancient of days to become an infant of a span long. Think of
   the distance

   "From the highest throne in glory

   To the cross of deepest woe,"

   and consider the unexampled love which shines in Christ's gift of
   himself. But the Father gives the Son. "God so loved the world that he
   gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not
   perish, but have everlasting life." To give your wealth is something,
   if you make yourself poor; but to give your child is something more.
   When the patriot mother tears her son from her bosom, and cries, "Go,
   my first-born, to your country's wars; there, go and fight until your
   country's flag is safe, and the hearths and homes of your native land
   are secure," there is something in it; for she can look forward to the
   bloody spectacle of her son's mangled body, and yet love her country
   more than her own child. Here is heroism indeed; but God spared not his
   own Son, his only-begotten Son, but freely delivered him up for us all.
   "God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners,
   Christ died for us." I do implore you, do not look upon the sacrifice
   of Christ as an act of mere vengeance on the Father's part. Never
   imagine, oh! never indulge the idea, that Jesus died to make the Father
   complacent towards us. Oh, no, dear friends: Jesus' death is the effect
   of overwhelming and infinite love on the Father's part; and every blow
   which wounds, every infliction which occasions sorrow, and every pang
   which rends his heart, speaks of the Father's love as much as the joy,
   the everlasting triumph, which now surrounds his head.

   Let us add, however, to this, that, although Jesus Christ's dying as a
   substitute does give to him lawful right to all promised privileges,
   and does make him, as the covenant head of his people a claimant of the
   divine mercy, yet it does not render any of the gifts which we receive
   from God the less gifts from God. Christ has died; but still everything
   that we receive comes to us entirely as a gratuitous outflow of God's
   great heart of love. Never think you have any claim to anything because
   Christ purchased it. If you use the word claim at all, let it always be
   in so humble and modified a sense that you understand that you are
   still receiving, not of debt, but of grace. Look upon the whole
   transaction of a substitute, and of Christ becoming the second Adam, as
   being a matter of pure, rich, free, sovereign grace, and never indulge
   the atrocious thought, I pray you, that there was justice, and justice
   only here; but do magnify the love and pity of God in that he did
   devise and accomplish the great plan of salvation by an atoning
   sacrifice.

   III. But now to go a step further, and with as much brevity as
   possible. The Lord having established the principle of substitution,
   having provided a substitute, and having through him bestowed upon us
   gratuitously innumerable mercies, let us observe THAT JESUS IS THE MOST
   FITTING PERSON TO BE A SUBSTITUTE, AND THAT HIS WORK IS THE MOST
   FITTING WORK TO BE A SATISFACTION.

   Let every sinner here who desires something stable to fix his faith
   upon, listen to these simple truths, which I am trying to put as
   plainly as possible. You do understand me, I trust, that God must
   punish sin; that he must punish you for sin unless some one else will
   suffer in your stead; that Jesus Christ is the person who did suffer in
   the room and place of all those who ever have believed on him who do
   believe in him, or ever shall believe in him, --making for those who
   believe on him a complete atonement by his substitution in their place.
   Now we say that Christ was the best person to be a substitute; for just
   consider what sort of a mediator was needed. Most absolutely he must be
   one who had no debt of his own. If Christ had been at all under the law
   naturally, if it had been his duty to do what it is our duty to do, it
   is plain he could only have lived for himself; and if he had any sin of
   his own, he could only have died for himself, seeing his obligations to
   do and to suffer would have been his just due to the righteousness and
   the vengeance of God. But on Christ's part there was no natural
   necessity for obedience, much less for obedience unto death. Who shall
   venture to say that the Divine Lord, amidst the glories of heaven, owed
   to his father anything? "Who shall say it was due to the Divine Father
   that Christ should be nailed to the accursed tree, to suffer, bleed,
   and die, and then be cast into the grave? None can dare to say such a
   thing. He is himself perfectly free, and therefore can he undertake for
   others. One man who is drawn for the militia cannot be a substitute for
   another person so drawn, because he owes for himself his own personal
   service. I must, if I would escape, and would procure a substitute,
   find a man who is not drawn, and who is therefore exempt. Such is Jesus
   Christ. He is perfectly exempt from service, and therefore can
   volunteer to undertake it for our sake. He is the right person.

   There was needed, also, one of the same nature with us. Such is Jesus
   Christ. For this purpose he became man, of the substance of his mother,
   very man, such a man as any of us. Handle him, and see if he be not
   flesh and bones. Look at him, and mark if he be not man in soul as well
   as in body. He hungers; he thirsts, he fears, he weeps, he rejoices, he
   loves, he dies. Made in all points and like unto us, being a man, and
   standing exactly in a man's place, becoming a real Adam,--as true an
   Adam as was the first Adam, standing quite in the first Adam's
   place,--he is a fit person to become a substitute for us.

   But please to observe (see if you cannot throw your grappling-hooks
   upon this), the dignity of his sacred person made him the most proper
   person for a substitute. A mere man could at most only substitute for
   one other man. Crush him as you will, and make him feel in his life
   every pang which flesh is heir to, but he can only suffer what one man
   would have suffered. He could not, I will venture to say, even then
   have suffered an equivalent for that eternal misery which the ungodly
   deserve; and if he were a mere man, he must suffer precisely the same.
   A difference may be made in the penalty, when there is a difference in
   the person; but if the person be the same, the penalty must be
   precisely and exactly the same in degree and in quality. But the
   dignity of the Son of God, the dignity of his nature, changes the whole
   matter. A God bowing his head, and suffering and dying, in the person
   of manhood, puts such a singular efficacy into every groan and every
   pang that it needs not that his pangs should be eternal, or that he
   should die a second death. Remember that in pecuniary matters you must
   give a quid pro quo, but that in matters of penal justice no such thing
   is demanded. The dignity of the person adds a special force to the
   substitution; and thus one bleeding Saviour can make atonement for
   millions of sinful men, and the Captain of our salvation can bring
   multitudes unto glory.

   It needs one other condition to be fulfilled. The person so free from
   personal service, and so truly in our nature, and yet so exalted in
   person, should also be accepted and ordained of God. Our text gives
   this a full solution, in that it says, "He shall make his soul an
   offering for sin." Christ did not make himself a sin-offering without a
   warrant from the Most High: God made him so. "The Lord hath laid on him
   the iniquity of us all." It was the sovereign degree of heaven which
   constituted Christ the great substitute for his people. No man taketh
   this office upon himself. Even the Son of God stoopeth not to this
   burden uncalled. He was chosen as the covenant-head in election; he was
   ordained in the divine decree to stand for his people. God the Father
   cannot refuse the sacrifice which he has himself appointed. "My son,"
   said good old Abraham, "God shall provide himself a lamb for a
   burnt-offering." He has done so in the Saviour; and what God provides,
   God must and will accept.

   I wish to-night that I had power to deal with this doctrine as I would.
   Poor trembling sinner, look up a moment. Dost thou see him there--him
   whom God hath set forth? Dost thou see him in proper flesh and blood
   fastened to that tree? See how the cruel iron drags through his tender
   hands! Mark how the rough nails are making the blood flow profusely
   from his feet! See how fever parches his tongue, and dries his whole
   body like a potsherd! Hearest thou the cry of his spirit, which is
   suffering more than his body suffers--"My God, my God, why hast thou
   forsaken me?" This is none other than God's only-begotten Son; this is
   he who made the worlds; this is the express image of his Father's
   person, the brightness of Jehovah's glory! What thinkest thou, man? Is
   there not enough there to satisfy God? Truly it has satisfied God: is
   there not enough there to satisfy thee? Cannot thy conscience rest on
   that? If God's appointed Christ could suffer in thy stead, is it not
   enough? What can Justice ask more? Wilt thou now trust Christ with thy
   soul? Come, now, sir, wilt thou now fall flat at the foot of the cross,
   and rest thy soul's eternal destiny in the pierced hands of Jesus of
   Nazareth? If thou wilt, then God has made him to be a sin-offering for
   thee; but if thou wilt not, beware, lest he whom thou wouldst not have
   to be thy Saviour should become thy Judge, and say, "Depart, thou
   cursed one, into everlasting fire in hell!"

   IV. We come now to our fourth remark,--THAT CHRIST'S WORK, AND THE
   EFFECTS OF THAT WORK, ARE NOW COMPLETE.

   Christ becomes a substitute for us. We have seen how fit and proper a
   person he was to be such. We hinted that from the dignity of his person
   the pains he suffered were a good and sufficient equivalent for our own
   suffering on account of sin. But now the joyous truths come up that
   Christ's work is finished. Christ has made an atonement so complete
   that he never need suffer again. No more drops of blood; no more pangs
   of heart; no more bitterness and darkness, with exceeding heaviness,
   even unto death, are needed.

   "Tis done--the great transaction's done."

   The death-knell of the penalty rings in the dying words of the
   Saviour,--"It is finished." Do you ask for a proof of this? Remember
   that Jesus Christ rose again from the dead. If he had not completed his
   work of penalty-suffering, he would have been left in the tomb till
   now; our preaching would have been in vain, and your faith would have
   been in vain; ye would have been yet in your sins. But Jesus rose.
   God's sheriff's officer let him out of "durance vile" because the
   account had been discharged, and God's great Court of King's Bench sent
   down the mittimus to let the captive go free. More than that: Christ
   has ascended upon high. Think you he would have returned thither with
   unexpiated sin red upon his garments? Do you suppose he would have
   ascended to the rest and to the reward of an accomplished work? What!
   sit at his Fathers right hand to be crowned for doing nothing, and rest
   until his adversaries are made his footstool, when he has not performed
   his Father's will! Absurd! Impossible! His ascension in stately pomp,
   amidst the acclamations of angels, to the enjoyment of his Father's
   continued smile, is the sure proof that the work is complete.

   Complete it is, dear brethren, not only in itself, but, as I said, in
   its effects; that is to say, that there is now complete pardon for
   every soul which believeth in Christ. You need not do anything to make
   the atonement of Christ sufficient to pardon you. It wants no eking
   out. It is not as if Christ had put so much into the scale and it was
   quivering in the balance; but your sins, for all their gravity, utterly
   ceased their pressure through the tremendous weight of his atonement.
   He has outweighed the penalty, and given double for all your sins.
   Pardon, full and free, is now presented in the name of Jesus,
   proclaimed to every creature under heaven, for sins past, for sins
   present, and for sins to come; for blasphemies and murders; for
   drunkenness and whoredom; for all manner of sin under heaven. Jesus
   Christ hath ascended up on high, and exalted he is that he may give
   repentance and remission of sin. Ye have no need of shillings to pay
   the priests; nor is baptismal water wanted to erect the pardon: there
   is no willing, doing, being, or suffering of yours required to complete
   the task. The blood has filled the fountain full: thou hast but to wash
   and be clean, and thy sins shall be gone forever.

   Justification, too, is finished. You know the difference. Pardon takes
   away our filth, but then it leaves us naked; justification puts a royal
   robe upon us. How no rags of yours are wanted; not a stitch of yours is
   needed to perfect what Christ has done. He whom God the Father hath
   accepted as a sin offering hath perfected forever thou who are set
   apart. Ye are complete in Christ. No tears of yours, no penance, no
   personal mortifications, nay, no good works of yours, are wanted to
   make yourself complete and perfect. Take it as it is. O sirs! may you
   have grace to take it as it is freely presented to you in the gospel.
   "He that believeth on him is not condemned;" "There is therefore now no
   condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus." Trust
   Christ--implicitly trust Christ; and all that he did shall cover you,
   while all that he suffered shall cleanse you.

   Remember, too, that acceptance is finished. There are the Father's
   arms, and here are you, a black sinner to-night. I do not know you, but
   it may be you have trodden the pavements, or you have gone further than
   that, and added drunkenness to shame; you have gone to the lowest vice,
   perhaps to robbery,--who knoweth what manner of person may step into
   this place?--but the great arms of the Eternal Father are ready to save
   you as you are, because the great work of Christ has effected all that
   is wanted before God for the acceptance of the vilest sinner. How is it
   that the Father can embrace the prodigal? Why! he is fresh from the
   swine-trough! Look at him: look at his rags; how foul they are! We
   would not touch them with a pair of tongs! Take him to the fire and
   burn the filth! Take him to the bath and wash him! That lip is not fit
   to kiss; those filthy lips cannot be permitted to touch that holy cheek
   of the glorious Father! Ah! but it is not so. While he was yet a great
   way off, his father saw him,--rags and poverty and sin and filth and
   all,--and he did not wait till he was clean, but ran and fell upon his
   neck and kissed him, just as he was. How could he do that? Why, the
   parable does not tell us; for it did not run on with the subject to
   introduce the atonement. But this explains it,--when God accepts a
   sinner, he is, in fact, only accepting Christ. He looks into the
   sinner's eyes, and he sees his own dear Son's image there, and he takes
   him in. As we have heard of a good woman, who, whenever a poor sailor
   came to her door, whoever he might be, would always make him welcome,
   because, she said, "I think I see my own dear son who has been these
   many years away, and I have never heard of him; but whenever I see a
   sailor, I think of him, and treat the stranger kindly for my son's
   sake." So my God, when he sees a sinner long for pardon and desirous of
   being accepted, thinks he sees his Son in him, and accepts him for his
   Son's sake. Do not imagine that we preach a gospel in this place for
   respectable, godly people. No: we preach a gospel here for sinners. I
   heard, the other day, from one who told me that he believed we were
   saved by being perfect, that when we committed sin we at once fell out
   of God's mercy. Well now, supposing that were true, it would not be
   worth making a large splutter about. It would not be worth angels
   singing "Glory to God in the highest" about it, I should think. Any
   fool might know that God would accept a perfect man. But this is the
   thing of marvel, for which heaven and earth shall ring with the praises
   of the Mediator, that Jesus Christ died for the ungodly,--that Jesus
   Christ gave himself for their sin; not for their righteousness, not for
   their good deeds. If he had looked to all eternity, he could not have
   seen anything in us worthy of so great a suffering as that which he
   endured; but he did it for charity's sake,--for love's sake.

   And now, in his name,--oh that I could do it with his voice and with
   his love and with his fervor!--I do beseech you to lay hold upon him.
   No matter who you may be, I will not exclude you from the invitation.
   Hast thou piled thy sins together till they seem to provoke heaven? Do
   thy sins touch the clouds? Yet come, and welcome; for God has provided
   a sin-offering. Has man cast thee out? Say, poor woman, does the dreary
   river seem to invite thee to the fatal plunge? God has not cast thee
   out. O thou who feelest in thine own body the effect of thy sin, till
   thou art loathing thyself, and wishing thou hadst never been
   born--perhaps thou sayest, like John Bunyan, "Oh that I had been a
   frog, or a toad, or a snake, sooner than have been a man, to have
   fallen into such sin, and to have become so foul!" Have courage,
   sinner; have courage. "Let the wicked forsake his way, and the
   unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord, and he
   will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly
   pardon." Do not doubt this message: God has sent it to you. Do not
   reject it: you will reject your own life if you do. Turn you at his
   rebuke! It is a loving voice which speaks to you, and that would speak,
   perhaps, better and more forcibly if it were not choked with love. I do
   implore thee, sinner, come to Jesus! If thou art damned it is not for
   want of invitation. If thou wilt perish, it is not for want of earnest
   pleading with thee. I tell thee, man, there is nothing of thine own
   wanted. All this is found in the sin-offering; for thou needest not
   find it. There is no merit of thine needed; there is merit enough in
   Christ. Is it not the old proverb that you are not to take coals to
   Newcastle? Do not take anything to Christ. Come as you are--just as you
   are. Nay, tarry not till you go out of this house. The Lord enable you
   to believe in Jesus now, to take him now as a complete and finished
   salvation for you, though you may be the most sunken and abandoned and
   hopeless of all characters. Why did God provide a sin-offering but for
   sinners? He could not have wanted to provide it if there was no
   necessity. You have a great necessity. You have, shall I say? compelled
   him to it. Your sins have nailed Christ's hands to the cross,--your
   sins have pierced his heart; and his heart is not pierced in vain, nor
   are those hands nailed there for naught. Christ will have you, sinner,
   Christ will have you. There are some of God's elect here, and he will
   have you. You shall not stand out against him. Almighty love will have
   you. He has determined that you shall not do what you have vowed. Your
   league with hell is broken to-night, and your covenant with death is
   disannulled. The prey shall not be taken from the mighty; the lawful
   captive shall be delivered. The Lord will yet fetch you up from the
   depths of the sea. Oh! what a debtor to grace you will be! Be a debtor
   to that grace to-night. Over head and ears in debt, plunge yourself by
   a simple act of trusting in Jesus, and you are saved.

   Pray, ye who know how to pray, that this message may be made effective
   in the hand of God. And you who have never prayed before, God help you
   to pray now. May he now be found of them who sought not for him, and he
   shall have the glory, world without end. Amen.

          "Alas For Us, If Thou Wert All, and Nought Beyond, O Earth"

   A Sermon

   (No. 562)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, March 27th, 1864, by the

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most
   miserable."--1 Corinthians 15:19.

   YOU WILL UNDERSTAND that the apostle is arguing with professedly
   Christian people, who were dubious about the resurrection of the dead.
   He is not saying that all men are now miserable if there be no hope of
   the world to come, for such an assertion would be untrue. There are
   very many who never think of another life, who are quite happy in their
   way, enjoy themselves, and are very comfortable after a fashion. But he
   speaks of Christian people--"If we, who have hope in Christ, are led to
   doubt the doctrine of a future state and of a resurrection, then we are
   of all men most miserable." The argument has nothing to do with some of
   you who are not Christians; it has nothing to do with you who have
   never been brought out of a state of nature into a state of grace; it
   only respects those who are real, living followers of the Savior, and
   who are known by this, that they have hope in Christ--hope in his blood
   for pardon, in his righteousness for justification, in his power for
   support, in his resurrection for eternal glory. "If we who have hope in
   Christ, have that hope for this life only, then we are of all men most
   miserable." You understand the argument; he is appealing to their
   consciousness; they, as Christians, had real enjoyments, "but," says
   he, "you could not have these enjoyments if it were not for the hope of
   another life; for once take that away, if you could still remain
   Christians and have the same feelings which you now have, and act as
   you now do, you would become of all men most miserable," therefore to
   justify your own happiness and make it all reasonable, you must admit a
   resurrection; there is no other method of accounting for the joyous
   peace which the Christian possesses. Our riches are beyond the sea; our
   city with firm foundations lies on the other side the river: gleams of
   glory from the spirit-world cheer our hearts, and urge us onward; but
   if it were not for these, our present joys would pine and die.

   We will try and handle our text this morning in this way. First, we are
   not of all men most miserable; but secondly, without the hope of
   another life we should be--that we are prepared to confess--because
   thirdly, our chief joy lies in the hope of a life to come; and thus,
   fourthly, the future influences the present; and so, in the last place,
   we may to-day judge what our future is to be.

   I. First then, WE ARE NOT OF ALL MEN MOST MISERABLE. Who ventures to
   say we are? He who will have the hardihood to say so knoweth nothing of
   us. He who shall affirm that Christianity makes men miserable, is
   himself an utter stranger to it, and has never partaken of its joyful
   influences. It were a very strange thing indeed, if it did make us
   wretched, for see to what a position it exalts us! It makes us sons of
   God. Suppose you that God will give all the happiness to his enemies,
   and reserve all the mourning for his sons? Shall his foes have mirth
   and joy, and shall his own home-born children inherit sorrow and
   wretchedness? Are the kisses for the wicked and the frowns for us? Are
   we condemned to hang our harps upon the willows, and sing nothing but
   doleful dirges, while the children of Satan are to laugh for joy of
   heart? We are heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ Jesus. Shall
   the sinner, who has no part nor lot in Christ, call himself happy, and
   shall we go mourning as if we were penniless beggars? No, we will
   rejoice in the Lord always, and glory in our inheritance, for we "have
   not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received
   the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father." The rod of
   chastisement must rest upon us in our measure, but it worketh for us
   the comfortable fruits of righteousness; and therefore by the aid of
   the divine Comforter, we will rejoice in the Lord at all times. We are,
   my brethren, married unto Christ; and shall our great Bridegroom permit
   his spouse to linger in constant grief? Our hearts are knit unto him:
   we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones, and though
   for awhile we may suffer as our Head once suffered, yet we are even now
   blessed with heavenly blessings in him. Shall our Head reign in heaven,
   and shall we have a hell upon earth? God forbid: the joyful triumph of
   our exalted Head is in a measure shared by us, even in this vale of
   tears. We have the earnest of our inheritance in the comforts of the
   Spirit, which are neither few nor small. Think of a Christian! He is a
   king, and shall the king be the most melancholy of men? He is a priest
   unto God, and shall he offer no sweet incense of hallowed joy and
   grateful thanksgiving? We are fit companions for angels: he hath made
   us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light; and
   shall we have no days of heaven upon earth? Is Canaan ours from Dan to
   Beersheba, and shall we eat no fruit from Eshcol's vine on this side of
   Jordan? Shall we have no taste of the figs, and of the pomegranates,
   and of the flowing milk and honey? Is there no manna in the wilderness?
   Are there no streams in the desert? Are there no streaks of light to
   herald our eternal sunrising? Heritors of joy for ever, have we no
   foretastes of our portion? I say again, it were the oddest thing in the
   world if Christians were more miserable than other men, or not more
   happy. Think again of what God has done for them! The Christian knows
   that his sins are forgiven; there is not against the believer a single
   sin recorded in God's book. "I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy
   transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins." More than that, the
   believer is accounted by God as if he had perfectly kept the law, for
   the righteousness of Christ is imputed to him, and he stands clothed in
   that fair white linen which is the righteousness of the saints, And
   shall the man whom God accepts be wretched? Shall the pardoned offender
   be less happy than the man upon whom the wrath of God abideth? Can you
   conceive such a thing? Moreover, my brethren, we are made temples of
   the Holy Ghost, and is the Holy Ghost's temple to be a dark, dolorous
   place, a place of shrieks, and moans, and cries, like the Druidic
   groves of old? Such is not like our God. Our God is a God of love, and
   it is his very nature to make his creatures happy; and we, who are his
   twice-made creatures, who are the partakers of the divine nature,
   having escaped the corruption which is in the world through lust, is it
   to be supposed that we are bound by a stern decree to go mourning all
   our days? Oh! if ye knew the Christian's privilege, if ye understood
   that the secret of the Lord is laid open to him, that the wounds of
   Christ are his shelter, that the flesh and blood of Christ are his
   food, that Christ himself is his sweet companion and his abiding
   friend, oh! if ye knew this, ye would never again foolishly dream that
   Christians are an unhappy race. "Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like
   unto thee, O people saved by the Lord?" Who can be compared with the
   man who is "satisfied with favor and full with the blessing of the
   Lord." Well might the evil prophet of Bethor exclaim, "Let me die the
   death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his."

   We will go a step farther. We will not only say that from the nature of
   his position and privileges, a Christian should be happy, but we
   declare that he is so, and that among all men there are none who enjoy
   such a constant peace of mind as believers in Christ. Our joy may not
   be like that of the sinner, noisy and boisterous. You know what Solomon
   says--"The laughter of fools is as the crackling of thorns under a
   pot"--a great deal of blaze and much noise, and then a handful of
   ashes, and it is all over. "Who hath woe, who hath redness of the eyes?
   They that tarry long at the wine-men of strength to mingle strong
   drink." The Christian, in truth, does not know much of the excitement
   of the bowl, the viol and the dance, nor does he desire to know; he is
   content that he possesses a calm deep-seated repose of soul. "He is not
   afraid of evil tidings, his heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord." He
   is not disturbed with any sudden fear: he knows that "all things work
   together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called
   according to his purpose." He is in the habit in whatever society he
   may be, of still lifting up his heart to God; and therefore he can say
   with the Psalmist, "My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will
   sing and give praise."

   "He waits in secret on his God;

   His God in secret sees;

   Let earth be all in arms abroad,

   He dwells in heavenly peace.

   His pleasures rise from things unseen,

   Beyond this world and time,

   Where neither eyes nor ears have been,

   Nor thoughts of sinners climb.

   He wants no pomp nor royal throne

   To raise his figure here:

   Content and pleased to live unknown,

   Till Christ his life appear.

   "There is a river the streams whereof make glad the city of God."
   Believers drink of that river and thirst not for carnal delights. They
   are made "to lie down in green pastures," and are led "beside the still
   waters." Now this solid, lasting joy and peace of mind sets the
   Christian so on high above all others, that I boldly testify that there
   are no people in the world to compare with him for happiness. But do
   not suppose that our joy never rises above this settled calm; for let
   me tell you, and I speak experimentally, we have our seasons of
   rapturous delight and overflowing bliss. There are times with us when
   no music could equal the melody of our heart's sweet hymn of joy. It
   would empty earth's coffers of every farthing of her joy to buy a
   single ounce of our delight. Do not fancy Paul was the only man who
   could say, "Whether in the body or out of the body, I cannot tell; God
   knoweth," for these ecstasies are usual with believers; and on their
   sunshiny days when their unbelief is shaken off and their faith is
   strong, they have all but walked the golden streets; and they can say,
   "If we have not entered within the pearly gate, we have been only just
   this side of it; and it we have not yet come to the general assembly
   and Church of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven, if we
   have not joined the great congregation of the perfect in actual body,
   yet still--

   "E'en now by faith we join our hands

   With those that went before,

   And greet the blood-besprinkled bands

   On the eternal shore."

   I would not change one five minutes of the excessive joy my soul has
   sometimes felt for a thousand years of the best mirth that the children
   of this world could give me. O friends, there is a happiness which can
   make the eye sparkle and the heart beat high, and the whole man as full
   of bounding speed of life as the chariots of Amminadib. There are
   raptures and high ecstasies, which on festival days such as the Lord
   allotteth to his people, the saints are permitted to enjoy. I must not
   fail to remind you that the Christian is the happiest of men for this
   reason, that his joy does not depend upon circumstances. We have seen
   the happiest men in the most sorrowful conditions. Mr. Renwick, who was
   the last of the Scotch martyrs, said a little before his death,
   "Enemies think themselves satisfied that we are put to wander in mosses
   and upon mountains, but even amidst the storm of these last two nights
   I cannot express what sweet times I have had when I have had no
   coverings but the dark curtains of night: yea, in the silent watch my
   mind was led out to admire the deep and inexpressible ocean of joy
   wherein the whole family of heaven do swim. Each star led me to wonder
   what He must be who is the star of Jacob, and from whom all stars
   borrow their shining." Here is a martyr of God driven from house and
   home and from all comforts, and yet having such sweet seasons beneath
   the curtains of the black night as kings do not often know beneath
   their curtains of silk. A minister of Christ going to visit a very,
   very poor man, gives this description. He says, "I found him alone, his
   wife having gone out to ask help of some neighbor. I was startled by
   the sight of the pale emaciated man, the living image of death,
   fastened upright in his chair by a rude mechanism of cords and belts
   hanging from the ceiling, totally unable to move hand or foot, having
   been for more than four years entirely deprived of the use of his
   limbs, and suffering extreme pain from swellings in all his joints. I
   approached him full of pity, and I said, "Are you left alone, my
   friend, in this deplorable situation?" He answered with a gentle
   voice--his lips were the only parts of his body which he appeared to
   have power to move--"No, sir, I am not alone, because the Father is
   with me." I began to talk with him, and I soon observed what was the
   source of his consolation, for just in front of him lay the Bible upon
   a pillow, his wife having left it open at some choice Psalm of David so
   that he might read while she was gone, as he had no power to turn over
   the leaves. I asked him what he had to live upon, and found that it was
   a miserable pittance, scarcely enough to keep body and soul together,
   "But," said he, "I never want anything, for the Lord has said, Your
   bread shall be given you, and your water shall be sure,' and I trust in
   him, and I shall never want while God is faithful to his promise." "I
   asked him," says this minister "whether he did not often repine on
   account of suffering so acutely for so many years. "Sir," said he, "I
   did repine at first, but not for the last three years, blessed be God
   for it, for I know whom I have believed, and though I feel my own
   weakness and unworthiness more and more, yet I am persuaded that he
   will never leave me nor forsake me; and so graciously does he comfort
   me that when my lips are closed with lock-jaw and I cannot speak a word
   for hours together, he enables me to sing his praises most sweetly in
   my heart." Now here was a man to whom the sun of all earthly comfort
   was set, and yet the sun of heaven shone full in his face, and he was
   more peaceful and happy in deep poverty and racking pain than all you
   or I have been in the health and strength of youth. John Howard spent
   his time in visiting the gaols and going from one haunt of fever to
   another, he was asked how he could find any ground of happiness when he
   was living in miserable Russian villages, or dwelling in discomfort in
   an hospital or a gaol. Mr. Howard's answer was very beautiful. "I
   hope," said he, "I have sources of enjoyment which depend not upon the
   particular spot I inhabit. A rightly cultivated mind, under the power
   of divine grace and the exercise of a benevolent disposition affords a
   ground of satisfaction that is not to be affected by heres and theres."
   Every Christian will bear you his witness that he has found his sad
   times to be his glad times, his losses to be his gains, his sicknesses
   means to promote his soul's health. Our summer does not depend upon the
   sun, nor our flood-tide upon the moon. We can rejoice even in death. We
   look forward to that happy hour when we shall close our eyes in the
   peaceful slumbers of death, believing that our last day will be our
   best day. Even the crossing of the river Jordan is but an easy task,
   for we shall hear him say, "Fear not; I am with thee: be not dismayed,
   I am thy God; when thou passest through the rivers I will be with thee,
   and the floods shall not overflow thee." We dare to say it, then, very
   boldly, we are not of all men most miserable: we would not change with
   unconverted men for all their riches, and their pomp, and their honor
   thrown into the scale.

   "Go you that boast in all your stores,

   And tell how bright they shine,

   Your heaps of glittering dust are yours,

   And my Redeemer's mine.

   II. This brings us to the second point--WITHOUT THE HOPE OF ANOTHER
   LIFE, WE WILL ADMIT, THAT WE SHOULD BE OF ALL MEN MOST MISERABLE.

   Especially was this true of the apostles. They were rejected by their
   countrymen; they lost all the comforts of home; their lives were spent
   in toil, and were daily exposed to violent death. They all of them
   suffered the martyr's doom, except John, who seems to have been
   preserved not from martyrdom, but in it. They were certainly the twelve
   most miserable of men apart from that hope of the world to come, which
   made them of all men the most happy. But this is true, dear friends,
   not merely of persecuted, and despised, and poverty-stricken
   Christians, but of all believers. We are prepared to grant it, that
   take away from us the hope of the world to come we should be more
   miserable than men without religion. The reason is very clear, if you
   think that the Christian has renounced those common and ordinary
   sources of joy from which other men drink. We must have some pleasure:
   it is impossible for men to live in this world without it, and I can
   say most truthfully I never urge any of you to do that which would make
   you unhappy. We must have some pleasure. Well then, there is a vessel
   filled with muddy filthy water which the camels' feet have stirred:
   shall I drink it? I see yonder a rippling stream of clear flowing
   water, pure as crystal and cooling as the snow of Lebanon, and I say,
   "No, I will not drink this foul, muddy stuff; leave that for beasts; I
   will drink of you clear stream." But if I be mistaken, if there be no
   stream yonder, if it be but the deceitful mirage, if I have been
   deluded, then I am worse off than those who were content with the muddy
   water, for they have at least some cooling draughts; but I have none at
   all. This is precisely the Christian's case. He passes by the pleasures
   of sin, and the amusements of carnal men, because he says, "I do not
   care for them, I find no pleasure in them: my happiness flows from the
   river which springs from the throne of God and flows to me through
   Jesus Christ--I will drink of that," but if there were no hereafter, if
   that were proved to be a deception, then were we more wretched than the
   profligate and licentious.

   Again, the Christian man has learned the vanity of all earthly joys. We
   know when we look upon pomp that it is an empty thing. We walk through
   the world, not with the scorn of Diogenes, the cynical philosopher, but
   with something of his wisdom, and we look upon the common things in
   which men rejoice, and say with Solomon, "Vanity of vanities, all is
   vanity." And why do we say this? Why, because we have chosen eternal
   things in which there is no vanity, and which are satisfying to the
   soul. But, my brethren, it is the most unhappy piece of knowledge which
   a man can acquire, to know that this world is vain, if there be not
   another world abundantly to compensate for all our ills. There is a
   poor lunatic in Bedlam, plaiting straw into a crown which he puts upon
   his head, and calls himself a king, and mounts his mimic throne and
   thinks that he is monarch over all nations, and is perfectly happy in
   his dream. Do you think that I would undeceive him? Nay, verily, if I
   could, I would not. If the delusion makes the man happy, by all means
   let him indulge in it; but, dear friends, you and I have been
   undeceived; our dream of perfect bliss beneath the skies is gone for
   ever; what then if there be no world to come? Why then it is a most
   sorrowful thing for us that we have been awakened out of our sleep
   unless this better thing which we have chosen, this good part which
   shall not be taken from us, should prove to be real and true, as we do
   believe it is.

   Moreover, the Christian man is a man who has had high, noble, and great
   expectations, and this is a very sad thing for us if our expectations
   be not fulfilled, for it makes us of all men most miserable. I have
   known poor men waiting and expecting a legacy. They had a right to
   expect it, and they have waited, and waited, and borne with poverty,
   and the relative has died and left them nothing; their poverty has ever
   afterwards seemed to be a heavier drag than before. It is an unhappy
   thing for a man to have large ideas and large desires, if he cannot
   gratify them. I believe that poverty is infinitely better endured by
   persons who were always poor, than by those who have been rich and have
   had to come down to penury, for they miss what the others never had,
   and what the originally poor would look upon as luxuries they consider
   to be necessary to their existence. The Christian has learned to think
   of eternity, of God, of Christ, of communion with Jesus, and if indeed
   it be all false, he certainly has dreamed the most magnificent of all
   mortal visions. Truly, if any man could prove it to be a vision, the
   best thing he could do would be to sit down and weep for ever to think
   it was not true, for the dream is so splendid, the picture of the world
   to come so gorgeous, that I can only say, if it be not true, it ought
   to be--if it be not true, then there is nothing here worth living for,
   my brethren, and we are disappointed wretches indeed--of all men most
   miserable.

   The Christian, too, has learned to look upon everything here on earth
   as fleeting. I must confess every day this feeling grows with me. I
   scarce look upon my friends as living. I walk as in a land of shadows,
   and find nothing enduring around me. The broad arrow of the great
   skeleton king is, to my eye, visibly stamped everywhere. I go so often
   to the grave, and with those I least expected to take there, that it
   seems to be rather a world of dying than of living men. Well, this is a
   very unhappy thing--a very wretched state of mind for a man to be in,
   if there be no world to come. If there be no resurrection of the dead,
   then is the Christian indeed committed to a state of mind the most
   deplorable and pitiable. But, O my brethren, if there be a world to
   come, as faith assures us there is, how joyous it is to be weaned from
   the world, and to be ready to depart from it! To be with Christ is far
   better than to tarry in this vale of tears.

   "The cords that bound my heart to earth

   Are broken by his hand;

   Before his cross I find myself,

   A stranger in the land.

   My heart is with him on his throne,

   And ill can brook delay;

   Each moment listening for the voice,

   'Make haste, and come away."'

   May I not pant to be in my own sweet country with my own fair Lord, to
   see him face to face? Yet, if it be not so and there be no resurrection
   of the dead, "we are of all men most miserable."

   III. OUR CHIEF JOY IN THE HOPE OF THE WORLD TO COME. Think of the world
   to come, my brethren, and let your joys begin to kindle into flames of
   delight, for heaven offers you all that you can desire. You are, many
   of you, weary of toil; so weary, perhaps, that you can scarcely enjoy
   the morning service because of the late hours at which you have had to
   work at night. Ah! there is a land of rest--of perfect rest, where the
   sweat of labor no more bedews the worker's brow, and fatigue is for
   ever banished. To those who are weary and spent, the word "rest" is
   full of heaven. Oh! happy truth, there remaineth a rest for the people
   of God. " They rest from their labors, and their works do follow them."
   Others of you are always in the field of battle; you are so tempted
   within, and so molested by foes without, that you have little or no
   peace. I know where your hope lies. It lies in the victory, when the
   banner shall be waved aloft, and the sword shall be sheathed, and you
   shall hear your Captain say, "Well done, good and faithful servant;
   thou hast fought a good fight; thou hast finished thy course:
   henceforth wear thou the crown of life which fadeth not away." Some of
   you are tossed about with many troubles; you go from care to care, from
   loss to loss: it seems to you as if all God's waves and billows had
   gone over you; but you shall soon arrive at the land of happiness,
   where you shall bathe your weary soul in seas of heavenly rest, You
   shall have no poverty soon; no mud-hovel, no rags, nor hunger. "In my
   Father's house are many mansions," and there shall you dwell, satisfied
   with favor, and full of every blessing. You have had bereavement after
   bereavement; the wife has been carried to the tomb, the children have
   followed, father and mother are gone, and you have few left to love you
   here; but you are going to the land where graves are unknown things,
   where they never see a shroud, and the sound of the mattock and the
   spade are never heard; you are going to your Father's house in the land
   of the immortal, in the country of the hereafter, in the home of the
   blessed, in the habitation of God Most High, in the Jerusalem which is
   above, the mother of us all. Is not this your best joy, that you are
   not to be here for ever, that you are not to dwell eternally in this
   wilderness, but shall soon inherit Canaan? With all God's people their
   worst grief is sin. I would not care for any sorrow, if I could live
   without sinning. Oh! if I were rid of the appetites of the flesh and
   the lusts thereof, and the desires which continually go astray, I would
   be satisfied to lie in a dungeon and rot there, so as to be delivered
   from the corruption of sin. Well but, brethren, we shall soon attain
   unto perfection. The body of this death will die with this body. There
   is no temptation in heaven, for the dog of hell can never cross the
   stream of death; there are no corruptions there, for they have washed
   their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb; there shall
   by no means enter into that kingdom anything which defileth. Methinks
   as I hear the joyous song of the glorified this morning, as I catch
   floating down from heaven the sound of that music which is like many
   waters and like the great thunder, and as I hear the harmony of those
   notes which are sweet as harpers harping with their harps, my soul
   desireth to stretch her wings, and fly straight to yonder worlds of
   joy. I know it is so with you, my brethren in the tribulation of
   Christ--as you wipe the sweat your brow, is not this the comfort: there
   is rest for the people of God? As you stand out against temptation and
   suffer for Christ's sake, is not this your comfort: " If we suffer with
   him, we shall also reign with him." When you are slandered and despised
   by men, is not this your hope: "He will remember me when he cometh into
   his kingdom. I shall sit upon his throne, even as he has overcome, and
   sitteth down upon his Father's throne?" Oh! yes, this is the music to
   which Christians dance; this is the wine which maketh glad their
   hearts; this is the banquet at which they feast. There is another and a
   better land, and we, though we sleep with the clods of the valley,
   shall in our flesh see God, when our Redeemer shall stand in the latter
   days upon the earth. I think you catch my drift--we are not of all men
   most miserable; apart from the future hope we should be, for our hope
   in Christ for the future is the mainstay of our joy.

   IV. Now, dear friends, this brings me to a practical observation in the
   fourth place, which is, that THUS THE FUTURE OPERATES UPON THE PRESENT.

   I had some time ago a conversation with a very eminent man whose fame
   is familiar to you all, but whose name I do not feel justified in
   mentioning, who was once a professed believer but is now full of
   scepticism. He said to me in the course of our argument, "Why, how
   foolish you are, and all the company of preachers. You tell people to
   think about the next world, when the best thing they could do would be
   to behave themselves as well as they can in this!" I granted the truth
   of the observation; it would be very unwise to make people neglect the
   present, for it is of exceeding great importance, but I went on to show
   him that the very best method to make people attend to the present was
   by impressing them with high and noble motives with regard to the
   future. The potent force of the world to come supplies us through the
   Holy Spirit with force for the proper accomplishment of the duties of
   this life. Here is a man who has a machine for the manufacture of
   hardware. He wants steam power to work this machine. An engineer puts
   up a steam engine in a shed at some considerable distance. "Well,"
   saith the other, "I asked you to bring steam power here, to operate
   upon my machine." "That is precisely," says he, "what I have done. I
   put the steam engine there, you have but to connect it by a band and
   your machine works as fast as you like; it is not necessary that I
   should put the boiler, and the fire, and the engine close to the work,
   just under your nose: only connect the two, and the one will operate
   upon the other." So God has been pleased to make our hopes of the
   future a great engine wherewith the Christian man may work the ordinary
   machine of every-day life, for the band of faith connects the two, and
   makes all the wheels of ordinary life revolve with rapidity and
   regularity. To speak against preaching the future as though it would
   make people neglect the present is absurd. It is as though somebody
   should say, "There, take away the moon, and blot out the sun. What is
   the use of them--they are not in this world?" Precisely so, but take
   away the moon and you have removed the tides, and the sea becomes a
   stagnant, putrid pool. Then take away the sun--it is not in the
   world--take it away, and light, and heat, and life; everything is gone.
   What the sun and moon are to this natural world, the hope of the future
   is to the Christian in this world. It is his light--he looks upon all
   things in that light, and sees them truly. It is his heat; it gives him
   zeal and energy. It is his very life: his Christianity, his virtue
   would expire if it were not for the hope of the world to come. Do you
   believe, my brethren, that apostles and martyrs would ever have
   sacrificed their lives for truth's sake if they had not looked for a
   hereafter? In the heat of excitement, the soldier may die for honor,
   but to die in tortures and mockeries in cold blood needs a hope beyond
   the grave. Would you poor man go toiling on year after year, refusing
   to sacrifice his conscience for gain; would yon poor needle-girl refuse
   to become the slave of lust if she did not see something brighter than
   earth can picture to her as the reward of sin? O my brethren, the most
   practical thing in all the world is the hope of the world to come; and
   you see the text teaches this, for it is just this which keeps us from
   being miserable; and to keep a man from being miserable, let me say, is
   to do a great thing for him, for a miserable Christian--what is the use
   of him? Keep him in a cupboard, where nobody can see him; nurse him in
   the hospital, for he is of no use in the field of labor. Build a
   monastery, and put all miserable Christians in it, and there let them
   meditate on mercy till they learn to smile; for really there is no
   other use for them in the world, But the man who has a hope of the next
   world goes about his work strong, for the joy of the Lord is our
   strength. He goes against, temptation mighty, for the hope of the next
   world repels the fiery darts of the adversary. He can labor without
   present reward, for he looks for a reward in the world to come. He can
   suffer rebuke, and can afford to die a slandered man, because he knows
   that God will avenge his own elect who cry day and night unto him.
   Through the Spirit of God the hope of another world is the most potent
   force for the product of virtue; it is a fountain of joy; it is the
   very channel of usefulness. It is to the Christian what food is to the
   vital force in the animal frame. Let it be said of any of us, that we
   are dreaming about the future and forgetting the present, but let the
   future sanctify the present to highest uses. I fear our prophetical
   brethren err here. They are reading continually about the last vials,
   the seventy weeks of Daniel, and a number of other mysteries; I wish
   they would set to work instead of speculating so much, or speculate
   even more if they will, but turn their prophecies to present practical
   account. Prophetical speculations too often lead men away from present
   urgent duty, and especially from contending earnestly for the faith
   once delivered to the saints; but a hope of the world to come is, I
   think, the best practical power which a Christian can have.

   V. And now, to conclude, this will let us see very clearly WHAT OUR
   FUTURE IS TO BE.

   There are some persons here to whom my text has nothing whatever to
   say. Suppose there were no hereafter, would they be more miserable?
   Why, no; they would be more happy. If anybody could prove to them that
   death is an eternal sleep, it would be the greatest consolation that
   they could possibly receive, It it could be shown, to a demonstration,
   that as soon as people die they rot in the grave and there is an end of
   them--why some of you could go to bed at night comfortable, your
   conscience would never disturb you, you would be molested by none of
   those terrible fears which now haunt you. Do you see, then, this proves
   that you are not a Christian; this proves as plainly as twice two make
   tour, that you are no believer in Christ; for if you were, the taking
   away of a hereafter would make you miserable. Since it would not tend
   to make you happy to believe in a future state, this proves that you
   are no believer in Christ. Well, then, what have Ito say to you? Why
   just this--that in the world to come, you will be of all men most
   miserable. "What will become of you?" said an infidel once to a
   Christian man, "supposing there should be no heaven?" "Well," said he,
   "I like to have two strings to my bow. If there be no hereafter I am as
   well off as you are; if there be I am infinitely better off. But where
   are you? Where are you?" Why then we must read this text in the
   future--"If in this life there be indeed a hope of a life to come, then
   you shall be in the next life of all men most miserable." Do you see
   where you will be? Your soul goes before the great Judge, and receives
   its condemnation and begins its hell. The trumpet rings; heaven and
   earth are astonished; the grave heaves; yonder slab of marble is lifted
   up, and up you rise in that very flesh and blood in which you sinned,
   and there you stand in the midst of a terrified multitude, all gathered
   to their doom. The Judge has come. The great assize has commenced.
   There on the great white throne sits the Savior who once said, "Come
   unto me, ye weary, and I will give you rest;" but now he sits there as
   a Judge and opens with stern hand the terrible volume. Page after page
   he reads, and as he reads he gives the signal, "Depart, ye cursed, into
   everlasting fire," and the angels bind up the fares in bundles to burn
   them. There stand you, and you know your doom; you already begin to
   feel it. You cry to the lofty Alps to fall upon you and conceal you. "O
   ye mountains, can ye not find in your rocky bowels some friendly cavern
   where I may be hidden from the face of him who sits upon the throne?"
   In terrible silence the mountains refuse your petition and the rocks
   reject your cry. You would plunge into the sea, but it is licked up
   with tongues of fire; you would fain make your bed even in hell if you
   could escape from those dreadful eyes, but you cannot; for now your
   turn is come, that page is turned over which records your history; the
   Savior reads with a voice of thunder and with eyes of lightning. He
   reads, and as he waves his hand you are cast away from hope. You shall
   then know what it is to be of all men most miserable. Ye had your
   pleasure; ye had your giddy hour; ye had your mirthful moments; you
   despised Christ, and you would not turn at his rebuke; you would not
   have him to reign over you; you lived his adversary; you died
   unreconciled, and now where are you? Now, what will ye do, ye who
   forget God, in that day when he shall tear you in pieces, and there
   shall be none to deliver you? In the name of my Lord and Master I do
   conjure you, fly away to Christ for refuge. "He that believeth in him
   shall be saved." To believe is to trust; and whosoever this morning is
   enabled by faith to cast himself upon Christ, need not fear to live,
   nor fear to die, You shall not be miserable here; you shall be thrice
   blessed hereafter if you trust my Lord.

   "Come, guilty souls, and flee away

   To Christ, and heal your wounds;

   This is the welcome gospel-day

   Wherein free grace abounds."

   O that ye would be wise and consider your latter end! O that ye would
   reflect that this life is but a span, and the life to come lasts on for
   ever! Do not, I pray you, fling away eternity; play not the fool with
   such solemn things as these, but in serious earnestness lay hold upon
   eternal life. Look to the bleeding Savior; see there his five wounds,
   and his face bedewed with bloody sweat! Trust him, trust him, and you
   are saved. The moment that you trust him your sins are gone. His
   righteousness is yours; you are saved on the spot, and you shall be
   saved when he cometh in his kingdom to raise the dead from their
   graves. O that the Lord might lead us all thus to rest on Jesus, now
   and ever. Amen.

                            The Barley Field on Fire

   A Sermon

   (No. 563)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning,, April 3rd, by the

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not
   come to him; and when he sent again, the second time, he would not
   come. Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near
   mine, and he hath barley there: Go and set it on fire. And Absalom's
   servants set the field on fire. Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom
   unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my
   field on fire?"--2 Samuel 14:29-31.

   YOU REMEMBER the historical narrative. Absalom had fled from Jerusalem
   under fear of David's anger. He was after a time permitted to return;
   but he was not admitted into the presence of the king. Earnestly
   desiring to be restored to his former posts of honor and favor, he
   besought Joab to come to him, intending to request him to act as
   mediator. Joab, having lost much of his liking for the young prince,
   refused to come; and, though he was sent for repeatedly, he declined to
   attend at his desire. Absalom therefore thought of a most wicked, but
   most effective plan of bringing Joab into his company. He bade his
   servants set Joab's field of barley on fire. This brought Joab down in
   high wrath to ask the question, "Wherefore have thy servants set my
   field on fire?" This was all that Absalom wanted; he wished an
   interview, and he was not scrupulous as to the method by which he
   obtained it. The burning of the barley-field brought Joab into his
   presence, and Absalom's ends were accomplished.

   Omitting the sin of the deed, we have here a picture of what is often
   done by our gracious God, with the wisest and best design. Often he
   sendeth for us, not for his profit, but for ours. He would have us come
   near to him and receive a blessing at his hands; but we are foolish and
   cold-hearted and wicked, and we will not come. He, knowing that we will
   not come by any other means, sendeth a serious trial: he sets our
   barley-field on fire; which he has a right to do, seeing our
   barley-fields are far more his than they are ours. In Absalom's case it
   was wrong; in God's case he has a right to do as he wills with his own.
   He takes away from us our most choice delight, upon which we have set
   our heart, and then we inquire at his hands, "Wherefore contendest thou
   with me? Why am I thus smitten with thy rod? What have I done to
   provoke thee to anger?" And thus we are brought into the presence of
   God, and we receive blessings of infinitely more value than those
   temporary mercies which the Lord had taken from us. You will see, then,
   how I intend to use my text this morning. As the pastor of so large a
   church as this, I am constantly brought into contact with all sorts of
   human sorrow. Frequently it is poverty,--poverty too which is not
   brought on by idleness or vice, but real poverty and most distressing
   and afflicting poverty too, because it visits those who have fought
   well the battle of life, and have struggled hard for years, and yet in
   their old age scarce know where bread shall come from, except that they
   rest upon the promise--"Thy bread shall be given thee, and thy water
   shall be sure." Messengers come to me sometimes as fast as they came to
   Job, bearing sad tidings concerning one and another of you. There comes
   one--"I entreat your prayers for me, sir: God has been pleased to take
   away my wife with a stroke; she now lies in the cold grave." Another
   cries, "O sir, my wife is sore sick, and the physician saith that there
   is but little hope: pray for her, that she may be strengthened in the
   hour of her departure; and for me, that I may be enabled to kiss the
   Master's rod." Then comes another--"My son is afflicted; he is to
   undergo a painful operation: pray that the surgeon's knife may not be
   his death, but that he may be enabled to bear up under it." And when I
   have sympathized with a company of sad complaints like these, another
   set of messengers will be waiting at the door. How few families are
   long without severe trials! hardly a person escapes for any long season
   without tribulation. With impartial hand sorrow knocks at the door of
   the palace and the cottage. Why all this? The Lord, we know, "Doth not
   afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men" for naught; why can
   it be that he employs so many frowning servants, and sendeth out so
   often his usher of the black rod? Wherefore can it be? Perhaps I may be
   able to give the fitting answer to this very proper inquiry, and it may
   be that I may be as serviceable to the afflicted as the jailer was to
   Paul and Silas when he washed their stripes.

   I shall use my text, first of all, in reference to believers; and then,
   with regard to the unconverted. Oh for help from above!

   I. First of all, brethren, let us use the text WITH REFERENCE TO
   BELIEVERS IN CHRIST.

   My beloved brethren and sisters in Jesus Christ, we cannot expect to
   avoid tribulation. If other men's barley-fields are not burned, ours
   will be. If the Father uses the rod nowhere else, he will surely make
   his true children smart. As Paul saith, and as our hymnster hath rhymed
   it--

   "Bastards may escape the rod,

   Sunk in earthly vain delight,

   But the true-born child of God,

   Must not--would not if he might."

   Your Saviour hath left you a double legacy, "In the world ye shall have
   tribulation; but in me ye shall have peace." You enjoy peace; you must
   not expect that you shall escape without the privilege of the
   tribulation. All wheat must be threshed: and God's threshing-floor
   witnesses to the weight of the flail as much as any other. Gold must be
   tried in the fire; and truly the Lord hath a fire in Zion, and his
   furnace in Jerusalem.

   But you, beloved, have four very special comforts in all your trouble.
   You have, first, this sweet reflection, that there is no curse in your
   cross. Christ was made a curse for us, and we call his cross the
   accursed tree; but, truly, since Jesus hung upon it, it is most
   blessed; and I may now say concerning the cross of affliction, "Blessed
   is every man who hangeth on this tree." The cross may be very heavy,
   especially while it is green, and our shoulders unused to carrying it;
   but remember, though there may be a ton-weight of sorrow in it, there
   is not a single ounce of the curse in it. God doth never punish his
   children in the sense of avenging justice: he chastens as a father does
   his child, but he doth never punish his redeemed as a judge doth a
   criminal. It were unjust to exact punishment in their place and stead.
   How shall the Lord punish twice for one offence? If Christ took my sins
   and stood as my substitute, then there is no wrath of God for me; and
   though my cup may be bitter, yet there cannot be a single drop of the
   wormwood of Almighty wrath in it. I may have to smart, but it will
   never be beneath the lictor's rods of justice, but under the Parent's
   rod of wisdom. O Christian! how sweet this ought to be to you! There
   was a time when you were under conviction of sin,--when you thought you
   would rot in a dungeon or burn at the stake most cheerfully, if you
   could but get rid of the sense of God's wrath; and will you now become
   impatient? The wrath of God is the thunderbolt which scathes the soul;
   and now that you are delivered from that tremendous peril, you must not
   be overwhelmed with the few showers and gales which Providence sends
   you. A God of love inflicts our sorrows: he is as good when he chastens
   as when he caresses: there is no more wrath in his afflicting
   providences than in his deeds of bounty. God may seem unkind to
   unbelief, but faith can always see love in his heart. Oh! what a mercy
   that Sinai has ceased to thunder! Lord, let Jesus say what he will, so
   long as Moses is quieted forever. Strike, Lord, if thou wilt, now that
   thou hast heard the Saviour's plea and justified our souls.

   You have, secondly, another ground of comfort; namely, that your
   troubles are all apportioned to you by divine wisdom and love. As for
   their number, if He appoint them ten, they never can be eleven. As for
   their weight, He who weigheth the mountains in scales and the hills in
   a balance, takes care to measure your troubles, and you shall not have
   a grain more than his infinite wisdom sees fit. The devil may seem to
   be turned loose upon you, but remember he is always a chained enemy.
   There is a tether to every trouble, and beyond that tether it can never
   stray. Nebuchadnezzar may heat the furnace seven times hotter than
   usual, but God's thermometer measures the exact degree of heat; and
   beyond it the flame cannot rage, even though a thousand Nebuchadnezzars
   should swear themselves out of breath in their fury. Consider
   everything that you have to suffer as the appointment of wisdom, ruled
   by love, and you will rejoice in all your tribulation, knowing that it
   shall reveal to you the loving-kindness and wisdom of your God.

   You have a third consolation; namely, that under your cross you have
   many special comforts. There are cordials which God giveth to sick
   saints which he never putteth to the lips of those who are in health.
   Dark caverns keep not back the miners, if they know that diamonds are
   to be found there: you need not fear suffering, when you remember what
   riches it yields to your soul. There is no hearing the nightingale
   without night, and there are some promises which only sing to us in
   trouble. It is in the cellar of affliction that the good old wine of
   the kingdom is stored. You shall never see Christ's face so well as
   when all others turn their backs upon you. When you have come into such
   confusion that human wisdom is at a nonplus, then shall you see God's
   wisdom manifest and clear. Oh the love-visits which Christ payeth to
   his people when they are in the prison of their trouble! Then he layeth
   bare his very heart to them, and comforts them as a mother doth her
   child. They sleep daintily who have Jesus to make their beds. Suffering
   saints are generally the most flourishing saints; and well they may be,
   for they are Jesus' special care. If you would find a man whose lips
   drop with pearls, look for one who has been in the deep waters. We
   seldom learn much except as it is beaten into us by the rod in Christ's
   schoolhouse, under Madam Trouble. God's vines owe more to the
   pruning-knife than to any other tool in the garden; superfluous shoots
   are sad spoilers of the vines. But even while we carry it, the cross
   brings present comfort: it is a dear, dear cross, all hung with roses,
   and dripping with sweet-smelling myrrh. Rutherford seemed at times in
   doubt which he loved best, Christ or his cross; but then, good man, he
   only loved the cross for his Lord's sake. Humble souls count it a high
   honor to be thought worthy to suffer for Christ's sake. If ever heaven
   be opened at all to the gaze of mortals, the vision is granted to those
   who dwell in the Patmos of want and trouble. Furnace-joys glow quite as
   warmly as furnace-flames. Sweet are the uses of adversity, and sweet
   are its accompaniments when the Lord is with his people.

   "Mid the gloom the vivid lightnings

   With increasing brightness play;

   'Mid the thorn-brake beauteous flowrets

   Look more beautiful and gay.

   So, in darkest dispensations

   Doth my faithful Lord appear,

   With his richest consolations,

   To reanimate and cheer."

   But then,--and this is the point to which my text brings me, and all I
   have already said is going astray from it,--you have this comfort, that
   your trials work your lasting good by bringing you nearer and nearer to
   God. This point we will illustrate by the narrative before us. My dear
   friends in Christ Jesus, our heavenly Father often sends for us and we
   will not come. He sends for us to exercise a more simple faith in him.
   We have believed, and by faith we have passed from death unto life, but
   our faith sometimes staggers. We have not yet reached to Abraham's
   confidence in God; we do not leave our worldly cares with him, but,
   like Martha, we cumber ourselves with much serving. We have faith to
   lay hold upon little promises; but we are ofttimes afraid to open our
   mouths wide though God has promised to fill them. He therefore sendeth
   to us. "Come, my child," saith he; "come and trust me. The veil is
   rent: enter into my presence, and approach boldly to the throne of my
   grace. I am worthy of thy fullest confidence: cast thy cares on me.
   Come thou into the sunlight, and read thy title clear. Shake thyself
   from the dust of thy cares, and put on thy beautiful garment of faith.
   " But, alas! though called with tones of love to the blessed exercise
   of this comforting grace, we will not come. At another time he calls us
   to closer communion with himself. We have been sitting on the doorstep
   of God's house, and he bids us advance into the banqueting-hall and sup
   with him; but we decline the honor. He has admitted us into the inner
   chambers, but there are secret rooms not yet opened to us; he invites
   us to enter them, but we hold back. Jesus longs to have near communion
   with his people. This is that which gives him "to see of the travail of
   his soul, and to be satisfied." It must be a joy to a Christian to be
   with Christ; but it is also a joy to Jesus to be with his people, for
   it is written, "His delights were with the sons of men." Now, one would
   think that if Christ did but beckon with his finger and say to us,
   "Draw nigh, and commune with me," we should fly as though we had wings
   to our feet; but, instead thereof, we are cleaving to the dust: we have
   too much business; we have too many carking cares; and we forget to
   come, though it is our Beloved's voice which calls us to himself.
   Frequently the call is to more fervent prayer. Do you not feel in
   yourself, at certain seasons, an earnest longing for private prayer?
   You have felt as if you could not be at ease until you could draw near
   unto God and tell him your wants; and yet, may be, you have quenched
   the Spirit in that respect, and still have continued without nearness
   of access to God. Every day the Lord bids his people come to him and
   ask what they will, and it shall be done. He is a bounteous God, who
   sits upon the mercy-seat, and he delights to give to his people the
   largest desires of their hearts; and yet, shame upon us, we live
   without exercising this power of prayer, and we miss the plentitude of
   blessing which would come out of that cornucopia of grace,--prevailing
   prayer with God. Ah, brethren, we are verily guilty here, the most of
   us. The Master sendeth to us to pray, and we will not come. Often, too,
   he calls us to a higher state of piety. From this pulpit I have labored
   to stir you up to nobler attainments; I have besought you to rest no
   longer satisfied with your dwarfish attainments, but to press forward
   to things more sublime and heavenly. Have I not cried unto you,
   beloved, and bid you

   "Forget the steps already trod,

   And onward urge your way."

   I am persuaded there are Christians as much in grace beyond ordinary
   Christians as ordinary Christians are beyond the profane. There are
   heights which common eyes have never seen, much less scaled. Oh! there
   are nests among the stars where God's own saints dwell, and yet how
   many of us are content to go creeping along like worms in the dust!
   Would that we had grace to cleave the clouds and mount into the pure
   blue sky of fellowship with Christ! We do not serve God as we should.
   We are cold as ice, when we should be like molten metal, burning our
   way through all opposition. We are like the barren Sahara, when we
   should be blooming like the garden of the Lord. We give to God pence,
   when he deserveth pounds; nay, deserveth our heart's blood to be coined
   in the service of his church and of his truth. Oh! we are but poor
   lovers of our sweet Lord Jesus; not fit to be his servants, much less
   to be his brides. If he had put us in the kitchen to be scullions, I
   fear we are scarce fit for the service; and yet he hath exalted us to
   be bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh, married to him by a
   glorious marriage covenant. O brethren! God often calleth us to higher
   degrees of piety, and yet we will not come.

   Now, why is it that we permit the Lord to send for us so often, without
   going to him? Let your own heart give the reason, in a humble
   confession of your offenses. O my brethren, we never thought we should
   have been so bad as we are. If an angel had told us that we should be
   so indifferent towards Christ, we should have said, as Hazael did to
   Elisha, "Is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing?" If
   any of us could have seen our own history written out by a prophet's
   pen, we should have said, "No; it cannot be. If Christ forgives me, I
   must love him; if he be pleased to make me his own brother, I must
   serve him; if I am the recipient of such splendid mercies, I must do
   something commensurate with his bounty." And yet, hitherto, here we
   have been ungrateful, unbelieving, and even refusing to listen to his
   call, or come at his bidding. He has said, "Seek ye my face;" and our
   heart did not say, "Lord, thy face will I seek." Because of all this,
   because we will not listen to the gentle call of God, there cometh
   trouble, just as there came the burning of the barley-field of Joab
   because he would not visit the young prince. Trouble comes in all sorts
   of shapes. Little doth it matter what form it cometh in, if it doth
   answer the purpose of making us obey the divine calling.

   Some Christians have their trial in the shape of sickness: they drag
   about with them a diseased body all their lives; or they are suddenly
   cast upon a bed of sickness, and they toss to and fro, by night and by
   day, in pain and weariness. This is God's medicine; and when God's
   children have it, let them not think it is sent to kill them, but to
   heal them. Much medicine which the physician gives makes the man ill
   for a time: he is worse with it than he would have been without it; but
   if he be a clever physician, he knows that this is the consequence of
   the medicine; and thus he is not at all alarmed by the pain of his
   patient, but he expects that all this will work for good, and hunt out,
   as it were, the original disease. When the Lord sends us sore sickness,
   it for a time perhaps makes our former spiritual infirmities grow
   worse; for sickness often provoketh impatience and murmurings against
   God, but in due time our proud spirits will be broken, and we shall cry
   for mercy. As a file takes off rust, so does sickness frequently remove
   our deadness of heart. The diamond hath much cutting, but its value is
   increased thereby; and so with the believer under the visitations of
   God. I have heard say of many ministers that they preach best after
   sickness, till their people have scarce regretted all the pains they
   have felt when they have found how savory and full of marrow have been
   their words. My brother, if you will not come to God without it, he
   will send you a sick-bed that you may be carried on it to him. If you
   will not come running, he will make you come limping. If you will not
   come while your eyes are bright and while your countenance is full of
   health, he will make you come when your eyes are dull and heavy, and
   your complexion is sallow and sad. But come you must; and if by no
   other means, sickness shall be the black chariot in which you shall
   ride.

   Losses, too, are frequently the means God uses to fetch home his
   wandering sheep: like fierce dogs, they worry the wanderers back to the
   shepherd. There is no making lions tame if they are too well fed; they
   must be brought down from their great strength, and their stomachs must
   be lowered a bit, and then they will submit to the tamer's hand: and
   often have we seen the Christian rendered obedient to his Lord's will
   by straitness of bread and hard labor. When rich and increased in
   goods, many professors carry their heads much too loftily and speak
   much too boastfully. Like David, they boast, "My mountain standeth
   fast; it shall never be moved." When the Christian groweth wealthy, is
   in good repute, hath good health, and a happy family, he too often
   admits Mr. Carnal Security to feast at his table. If he be a true child
   of God, there is a rod preparing for him. Wait awhile, and it may be
   you will see his substance melt away as a dream. There goes a portion
   of his estate--how soon the acres change hands! There goes a part of
   his business--no profits will ever come to him again in that direction.
   That debt yonder, a dishonored bill over there--how fast his losses
   come! where will they end? Now, as these embarrassments come in one
   after another, he begins to be distressed about them, and betakes
   himself to his God. O blessed waves, that wash the man on the rock of
   salvation! O blessed cords, though they may cut the flesh, if they draw
   us to Jesus! Losses in business are often sanctified to our soul's
   enriching. If you will not come to the Lord full-handed, you shall come
   empty. If God in his grace findeth no other means of making you to
   honor him among men--if you cannot honor him on the pinnacle of
   riches--he will bring you down to the valley of poverty.

   Bereavements, too,--ah! what sharp cuts of the rod we get with these,
   my brethren! We know how the Lord sanctifies these to the bringing of
   his people near to himself. How glad we should be to think that Christ
   himself once suffered bereavements as we have done. Tacitus tells us
   that an amber ring was thought to be of no value among the Romans till
   the emperor took to wearing one, and then straightway an amber ring was
   held in high esteem. Bereavements might be looked upon as very sad
   things; but when we recollect that Jesus wept over his friend Lazarus,
   henceforth they are choice jewels, and special favors from God. Christ
   wore this ring: then I must not blush to wear it. Many a mother has
   been stirred up to a holier life by the death of her infant,--many a
   husband has been led to give his heart more to Christ by the death of
   his wife. Do not departed spirits, like angels, beckon us up to heaven?
   "Come, come away," they say; "this is not your rest. I once could build
   upon the same tree, and sing upon the same bough; but now I am taken
   from you,--now I rest in heaven. Come hither, thou who wast once my
   fond mate--come hither, for all the trees where thou are building are
   marked for the axe; therefore come now, and dwell with me!" Yes, we
   must look upon our new-made graves in this light, and pray the Lord to
   dig our hearts with the funeral spade, and bury our sins as we bury our
   departed ones. Trials in your family, in your children, are another
   form of the burning barley-field. I do not know, brethren, but I think
   a living cross is much heavier to carry than a dead one. I know some
   among you who have not lost your children: I could have wished you had,
   for they have lived to be your grief and sorrow. Ah, young man! better
   that your mother should have seen you perish in the birth than that you
   should live to disgrace your father's name. Ah, man! it were better for
   you that the procession had gone winding through the streets, bearing
   your corpse down to the grave, than that you should live to blaspheme
   your mother's God, and laugh at the Book which is her treasure. It were
   better for you that you had never been born, and better for your
   parents too. Ah! but, dear friends, even these are meant to draw us
   nearer to Christ. We must not make idols of our children; and we dare
   not do it, when we see how manifestly God shows us that, like
   ourselves, they are by nature children of wrath. Sharper than an
   adder's tooth is an unthankful child; but the venom is turned to
   medicine in God's hand. God's birds would often keep down in the grass
   in their nests; but he fills their nests full of thorns, and then up
   they fly, and sing as a lark as they mount towards heaven. You must
   look upon these family trials as invitations from God--sweet compulsion
   to make you seek his face. Many are afflicted in another way, which is
   perhaps as bad as anything else,--by a deep depression of spirit. They
   are always melancholy; they know not why. There are no stars in the
   night for them, and the sun gives no light by day: melancholy has
   marked them for her own; but even this, I think, is often the means of
   keeping some of them nearer to God than they would be. You know there
   are some of our English plants which greatly affect damp, moist places
   under trees. If the sun were to shine in their faces they would die.
   Perhaps some minds are of the same order. Too many sweets make children
   sick, and bitters are a good tonic. A veil is needed for some delicate
   complexions, lest the sun look too fiercely on them: it may be, these
   mourners need the veil of sorrow. It is good that they have been
   afflicted, even with this heavy depression of spirit, because it keeps
   them near their God. Then there is that other affliction, the hiding of
   God's countenance--how hard to bear, but how beneficial! If we will not
   keep near to our Lord, he is sure to hide his face. You have seen a
   mother walking out with her little child, when it has just learned to
   walk; and as she goes through the street, the little one is for running
   sometimes to the right, and sometimes to the left, and so the mother
   hides herself a moment; then the child looketh round for the mother,
   and begins to cry, and then out comes the mother. What is the effect?
   Why, it will not run away from the mother any more: it is sure to keep
   hold of her hand afterwards. So, when we get wandering from God, he
   hides his face, and then, since we have a love for him, we begin crying
   after him; and when he shows his face once more, we cling to him the
   more lovingly ever afterwards. So the Lord is pleased to bless our
   troubles to us.

   Now, Christian, what about all this? Why, just this. Are you under any
   sharp trouble now? Then I pray you go to God as Joab went to Absalom.
   "Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?" "Show me wherefore
   thou contendest with me." "Search me, O God, and know my heart; try me,
   and know my thoughts; and see if there be any wicked way in me, and
   lead me in the way everlasting." Make this a special season of humbling
   and heart-searching. Now let every besetting sin be driven out. When
   God sweeps, do you search. When you are under the rod, it is yours to
   make a full confession of past offenses, and pray to be delivered from
   their power in the future. Or, have you no trial to-day, my brother?
   Then see if there be not something which may provoke God to send one,
   and begin now to purge yourself from all filthiness of the flesh and of
   the spirit by the Holy Ghost. Prevention is better than a cure; and
   sometimes a timely heart-searching may save us many a heart-smarting.
   Let us see to that, then. Or have we been afflicted, and is the
   affliction over now? Then, let us say with David, "Before I was
   afflicted I went astray; but now have I kept thy word." Let us bless
   God for all that he has done, saying "It is good for me that I have
   been afflicted;" let us join together in one common hymn of praise for
   all the loving-kindness which God has been pleased to show us in the
   sharp cuts of his rod. I have said enough, I think, to the Christian,
   to work out the little picture before us. God has burned your
   barley-field, dear friends: now go to him, and the closer you can
   approach to him, and the more firmly you can cling to him, the better
   for your soul's health and comfort all your life. At the last, you and
   I shall sing to the praise of our afflicting God.

   All I meet I find assists me

   In my path to heavenly joy;

   Where, though trials now attend me,

   Trials never more annoy.

   Blest there with a weight of glory,

   Still the path I'll ne'er forget,

   But, exulting, cry, It led me

   To my blessed Saviour's seat.

   II. A few words--God make them mighty--TO THE SINNER shall form the
   second part of our discourse. God also has sent for you. O unconverted
   man! God has often sent for you. Early in your childhood your mother's
   prayers sought to woo you to a Saviour's love, and your godly father's
   first instructions were as so many meshes of the net in which it was
   desired that you should be taken; but you have broken through all
   these, and lived to sin away early impressions and youthful promises.
   Since that you have often been called under the ministry. Our sermons
   have not been all shots wide of the mark, but sometimes a hot shot has
   burnt its way into your conscience and you have been made to tremble;
   but, alas! the trembling soon gave way before your old sins. Hitherto
   you have been called, but you refused. The hands of mercy have been
   stretched out, and you have not regarded them. You have had calls, too,
   from your Bible, from religious books, from Christian friends. Holy
   zeal is not altogether dead, and it shows itself by looking after your
   welfare. Young man, your shopmate has sometimes spoken to you; young
   woman, your companion has wept over you. There are some of you now
   present who have been called by the most loving of voices, in
   connection with our classes. Both in our Sunday-school and in the
   catechumenical classes there are men and women with deep love to the
   souls of those committed to them,--tender hearts, weeping eyes,--and
   you have been wept over that you might come to Christ; but still all
   the agency that has been employed has been up to this moment without
   effect; you are a stranger to the God who made you, and an enemy to
   Christ the Saviour.

   Well, if these gentle means will not do, God will employ other
   agencies. Perhaps he has tried them already. If not,--if he intendeth
   in the divine decree your eternal salvation,--he will, as sure as you
   are a living man, use stronger ways with you; and if a word will not
   do, he will come with a blow, though he loveth to try the power of the
   word first. You, too, my hearer unconverted and unsaved, have had your
   trials. You weep as well as Christians. You may not weep for sin, but
   sin shall make you weep. You may abhor repentance because of its
   sorrow, but you shall not escape sorrow, even if you escape repentance.
   you have had your sickness. Do you remember it, when in the silent
   night you heard the watch ticking out, as you thought, your last few
   minutes, and foretelling your doom? Do you remember those weary days,
   when you tossed from side to side, and did but shift the place and keep
   the pain? Man, can you recollect your vows, which you have lived to
   break, and your promises with which you lied unto the eternal God? Then
   the Sabbath would be your delight, you said, if you were spared, and
   the house of God and the people of God should be dear to you, and you
   would seek his face. But you have not done so: you have broken your
   covenant, and have despised your promise made to God. Or, what is it,
   have you had losses in business? You began life well and hopefully, but
   nothing has prospered with you. I am not sorry for it; for I remember
   it is the wicked who spreadeth himself like a green bay tree, and it is
   concerning the reprobate that it is written, "There are no bands in
   their death; but their strength is firm. They are not in trouble as
   other men; neither are they plagued like other men." I am glad that you
   are plagued. I would sooner see you whipped to heaven than coached to
   hell. Doubtless many go, like Agag, delicately to their hewing in
   pieces, while others go sorrowing to eternal glory. You have had
   losses: what are these but God's rough messengers to tell you that
   there is nothing beneath the sky worth living for, to wean you from the
   breasts of earth and cause you to look for something more substantial
   than worldly riches can afford you? And you, too, have lost friends;
   may I recall those graves, whose turf is yet so newly laid? May I
   remind you of children fair and beautiful in your eyes, taken away from
   you despite your tears? Shall I remind you of the parent who sleeps in
   Jesus? of a sweet sister who withered like a lily by early consumption?
   Shall I bring these thoughts back to you? I would not wish to make your
   wounds bleed afresh, but it is for your good that I bid you hearken to
   their solemn voice; for they say to you, "Come to your God. Be
   reconciled to him!" I do not think you ever will come to Jesus, unless
   the Holy Spirit shall employ trials to bring you. I find that the woman
   never found her piece of money till she swept the house. The prodigal
   never came back till he was hungry, and fain would have filled his
   belly with the husks which the swine did eat. I only hope that these
   troubles may be blessed to you. Besides this, you have had your
   depression of spirit. If I mistake not, I address some who are under
   such depressions now. You do not know how it is, but nothing is
   pleasant to you. You went to the theater last night. You wished you had
   not: it gave you no joy; and yet you have been as merry there as any,
   in former times. You go among your companions, and a day's pleasuring,
   as they call it, has become to you a very painful waste of time. You
   have lost the zest of life; and I am not sorry for it, if it should
   make you look for a better life, and trust in a world to come. My
   friends, again I say, this is the burning of your barley-fields. God
   has sent for you, and you would not come; and now he has sent
   messengers who are not so easily refused. He has sent these with
   sterner and rougher words, which speak to your flesh, if your spirit
   will not hear.

   Well, now, what then? If God is sending these, are you listening to
   them? My hearer, if God has sent these, have you listened to them?
   There are some of you of whom I almost despair. God can save you, but I
   cannot tell you how he will do it. Certainly the Word does not seem
   likely to be blessed. You have been called and entreated; early and
   late we have entreated you. Our hearts have yearned with tenderness for
   you, but hitherto in vain. God knows I have been hammering away at the
   granite, and it has not yielded yet; I have smitten the flint, and it
   is not broken. Some of you all but break the plowshare: you are such
   rocks that it seems in vain to plow upon you. As for trouble, I do not
   see that that is likely to do you any good; for if you are smitten
   again, you will revolt more and more. The whole head is sick already,
   and the whole heart is faint. You have been beaten, till from the crown
   of the head to the sole of your foot there is nothing but wounds,
   bruises, and putrifying sores. You are poor--perhaps your drunkenness
   has made you so; you have lost your wife--perhaps your cruelty helped
   to kill her; you have lost your children, and you are left a penniless,
   friendless, helpless beggar, and yet you will not turn to God! What now
   is to be done unto you? O Ephraim! what shall I do unto thee? Shall I
   give thee up? How can I give thee up? "How shall I make thee as Admah?
   how shall I set thee as Zeboim?" The heart of mercy still yearns after
   thee. Return thou! return thou! God help thee to return, even now.

   Others of you have not suffered all this in the past, but are just now
   enduring a part of it. Let me entreat you, by the mercies of God and by
   the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you despise not him who
   speaketh unto you. God doth not continue to send his messengers
   forever. After he hath labored with you for a time, he will leave you
   to cursing. Long-suffering lasts not forever. Mercy hath its day.
   Behold, the King runs up the white flag of comfort to-day, and he
   invites you to come unto him. To-morrow he may run up the red flag of
   threatening; and if that answereth not, if that red flag will not make
   you turn, he will run up the black flag of execution, and then there
   will be no hope. Beware! The black flag is not run up yet: the red flag
   is there now in trials and troubles, which are God's threatenings to
   you, bidding you open wide your heart that grace may enter; but if it
   cometh to this that the red flag fail, the black flag must come.
   Perhaps it has come! God help you with broken heart to cry unto him
   that you may be saved, before the candle is blown out and the sun is
   set, and the night of the dead is come on without the hope of another
   sun rising on a blessed resurrection.

   What is the drift of all this? My drift is this: If, now, a word of
   mine could make you come to the King this morning--I know it will not
   unless God the Holy Spirit compels you to do so by his irresistible
   power; but if he would bless it, I would rejoice as one who findeth
   great spoil. Wherefore do you stand out against God? If the Lord
   intendeth your eternal salvation, your resistance will be in vain; and
   how will you vex yourself in after years to think that you should have
   stood out so long! Wherefore dost thou resist? God's battering-ram is
   too mighty for the walls of your prejudice: he will make them fall yet.
   Why dost thou stand out against thy God, against him who loveth thee,
   who hath loved thee with an everlasting love, and redeemed thee by the
   blood of Christ? Why standest thou out against him who intends to lead
   thy captivity captive, and to make thee yet his rejoicing child? "Oh!"
   saith one, "if I thought there were such mercy as that, I would yield."
   If thou believest in the Lord Jesus Christ, this shall be an evidence
   that such mercy is ordained for thee. Oh that the Spirit of God would
   enable thee, sinner, to come just as thou art and put thy trust in
   Christ! If thou dost so, then it is certain that thy name is written in
   the Lamb's book of Life, that thou wast chosen of God and art precious
   to him, and that thy head is one on which the crown of immortality is
   to glitter forever. Oh that thou wouldst trust Christ! The joy and
   peace it works in the present is worth worlds; but oh the glory, the
   overwhelming glory which in worlds to come shall belong to those that
   trust in Jesus! God give you this morning to cast your souls upon the
   finished work of Jesus. His blood can cleanse; his righteousness can
   cover; his beauty can adorn; his prayer can preserve; his advent shall
   glorify; his heaven shall make you blessed. Trust him! God help you to
   trust him; and he shall have all the praise, both now and forever. Amen
   and amen.

                     A Promise For Us And For Our Children

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, APRIL 10, 1864, BY THE REV. C, H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Yet now hear, O Jacob, My servant. And Israel, whom Ihave chosen: thus
   says the Lord thatmadeyou and formed you from the womb, which will help
   you. Fear not, O Jacob, My servant. And you, Jesurun, whom Ihave
   chosen. For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty and floods upon
   the dry ground: I will pour My Spirit upon your seed and My blessing
   upon your offspring: and they shall spring up as among the grass, as
   willows by the water courses. One shall say, I am the Lord's, and
   another shall call himself by the name of Jacob. And another shall
   subscribe with his hand unto the Lord, and surname himself by the name
   of Israel." Isaiah 44:1-5.

   WE ought not to overlook the first and immediate meaning of these
   words. There can be no doubt that we have here a promise made to God's
   ancient people, the Jews. Whatever their sins may have been, God has
   not forever cast them away. They have become like the dry and thirsty
   desert, but the day will yet dawn when God's sovereign love shall again
   visit them and His Spirit shall distil upon them until Israel shall be
   glorious among the nations and her children shall be multiplied and
   saved. O that the long-expected day would hasten! Break, hallowed
   morning, for earth's watchers are growing weary! The twelve tribes
   right longingly wait for the appearance of Messiah the Prince and we
   also who believe in Jesus, joyfully expect His advent and the gathering
   together of Israel.

   How great will be the day of the Lord's gracious visitation! "For if
   the casting away of them is the reconciling of the world, what shall
   the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?" If the fall of them
   is the riches of the world and the diminishing of them the riches of
   the Gentiles, how much more their fullness? The vision tarries, but it
   will surely come! The Glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh
   shall see it together, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it. Be it
   ours to rejoice in that ancient promise, "There shall come out of Sion
   the Deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob: for this is
   My Covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins."

   Leaving this interesting view of the text, we will meditate on it, for
   practical purposes of comfort to ourselves. Observe that the text
   begins with the word, "Yet." What an ominous word as to the past! What
   a cheering word as to the future! "Yet." "Yet." What black words are
   those which come before it? Surely all is not well. Look at the
   preceding verses and see. God's people were represented as being in a
   sadly backsliding state. They had lost their love to the service of
   God. They neglected His altar. They brought Him no thank offerings. No,
   they had fallen into a state of sin until they wearied God with their
   iniquity.

   Consequently they fell into a condition of sorrow--God gave them up to
   the curse and the reproach. It may be that such is our case this
   morning, though we are God's people. Perhaps our soul lies cleaving in
   the dust. We have forgotten to run with diligence in the way of God's
   Commandments. We have fallen into a lukewarm state. We are following
   afar off. It may be that we have even fallen into sin and sitting in
   this House of Prayer we confess with Pharaoh's butler, "I do remember
   my faults this day."

   It is very possible that we have been made too smart for our sins. God
   may have hidden His face from us. Our faith may be flagging--our graces
   may be withering. It will be so, it must be so when we forsake our God.
   If we leave the flowing Fountain to trust in broken cisterns, we shall
   soon know the bitterness of thirst. "Yet." "Yet," says the text--"yet,"
   though you have fallen into this state, do not despair! Though you have
   transgressed very foully, do not think God has cast you away! "Yet now
   hear, O Jacob, My servant. And Israel, whom I have chosen." Yet--the
   word is a star of the morning, prophetic of brighter rays--yet I love
   you! Yet you are My chosen! Yet My loving heart is true to you! Yet
   will I return unto you in favor! Yet shall you rejoice in Me and be
   filled with My goodness!

   Come then, Brothers and Sisters, if we have wandered ever so far, let
   this word sound like the shepherd's call to bring us back. You need not
   always be sad--there is no necessity that you should be always weak in
   righteousness and abundant in sin--yet the promise is yours! Yet God
   loves you! Yet He invites you to come to Him! Return now and seek His
   face once more. You have lived in the feverish lowlands, yet climb the
   mountains! You have groveled in the dust, yet ascend as on eagles'
   wings! You have been covered with sackcloth, yet put on your beautiful
   array! Your neglect of the promises has not made them the less sure.
   The key of your faith may be rusted, but it will still open the door of
   mercy.

   You may have been unbelieving, but God abides faithful. Up! Enjoy your
   sure inheritance. Let us feel comforted by the very first word of the
   text and let it encourage us to lay hold, despite our own unworthiness,
   upon the great promise of the Lord. The Lord, in order to comfort His
   people and bring them out of their present state, first, reminds them
   of what He has done for them. Secondly, He repeats His promise of what
   He will do. And thirdly, He adds to this a most gracious and full
   promise of what He will do for their offspring.

   I. First, then, and O may the Lord refresh our memories by revealing to
   us the way by which He has led us--first of all HE COMFORTS HIS PEOPLE
   BY THE REMEMBRANCE OF WHAT HE HAS DONE FOR THEM. Come, my

   Brothers and Sisters, reach down for your biographies. Turn over your
   diaries. Go back with me a little while to that spot where first you
   knew the Savior. Then march on along the way by which the Lord has led
   you till you reach the day and hour which found you in the House of
   God, listening to His promise.

   1. Taking the text as our guide, let us notice, first, the Grace we
   have experienced in its practical effect. The practical effect of
   Divine Grace in our case has been to make us God's servants--"Yet now
   hear, O Jacob, My servant." We may be unfaithful servants--we certainly
   are unprofitable ones--but blessed be His name, if not awfully deceived
   we are His true servants! We were once the servants of sin and the
   slaves of our own passions, but He who made us free has now taken us
   into His family and taught us obedience to His will. We can say with
   David, "I am Your servant. I am Your servant and the son of Your
   handmaid: You have loosed my bonds."

   We do not serve our Master perfectly, but we would if we could. There
   are some of His Commandments which we forget, but there are none which
   we would despise. We do, through infirmity, turn aside unto crooked
   ways, but we find no comfort in them. Our meat and our drink is to do
   the will of Him who sent us and our prayer is--

   "Make me to walk in Your commands,
   It is a delightful road.
   Nor let my head, nor heart, nor hands,
   Offend against my God."

   Beloved, if God has made us His servants, let us be comforted. It is so
   great a change and so wonderful an effect of Irresistible Grace upon a
   man to transform him from an heir of wrath into a servant of the living
   God that we have herein ground for comfort.

   2. Observe again, this Grace is peculiar, discriminating and
   distinguishing. He calls us, "My chosen." We have not chosen Him first,
   but He has chosen us. If we are God's servants, we were not always
   so--to Sovereign Grace the change must be ascribed. We might have been
   left, like other men, to continue in sin and to be rebels against the
   King of Heaven, but the eyes of Sovereignty singled us out from among
   others not more unworthy than we were and it was the voice of Love
   which said, "I have loved you with an everlasting love."

   Long before those stars were kindled into flames--long before the sun
   begun his mighty course--long before the mountains lifted their hoary
   heads, or the deep clapped its hands in the tumultuous joy of tempest.
   Long before time began, or space was created, God had written upon His
   heart the names of His elect people. He had selected them, never to
   change His choice. He had united them unto the Person of His Son Jesus
   Christ by a Divine Decree never to be revoked. He had predestinated
   them to be conformed unto the image of His Son and had made them the
   heirs of all the fullness of His love, His Grace and His Glory.

   Have you and I been chosen? Can we see the connection between the link
   of calling and the link of predestination? Have we made our calling
   sure? If so, we may infer most certainly that we must have been
   predestinated. What comfort is here! Would the Lord have loved us so
   long and will He cast us away? I know you are dead and barren and your
   soul feels heavy and your sins stare you in the face, but did not your
   God know all this beforehand? He made the choice, knowing all--why
   then, should He change His purpose? He knew how stiff-necked you would
   be! He understood that your heart was evil and that the imaginations of
   it would be only evil, and that continually, and yet He loved you!

   Ah, my Savior is no fickle lover. He does not feel enchanted for awhile
   with some gleams of beauty from His Church's eye and then afterwards
   cast her off because of her unfaithfulness. No, my Brethren, He married
   her in old eternity and though, according to the words of the Prophet,
   she has played the harlot and done exceedingly evil, yet it is written
   of Jehovah, "He hates putting away." There is no divorce in the court
   of Heaven. Christ has espoused His people to Him in faithfulness and
   they shall know the Lord. Be this your comfort then--the activity of
   Grace has made you God's servant. The distinguishing character of Grace
   has made you His chosen.

   3. Reflect again, in the light of the text, upon the ennobling
   influence of Grace. The people are first called Jacob, but only in the
   next line they are styled Israel. You and I were but of the common
   order. If we had boasted of anything we should have been called Jacobs,
   supplanters, boasting beyond our line. But as Jacob at the brook Jabbok
   wrestled with the angel and prevailed and gained the august title of
   prince--prevailing prince--"For as a prince have you power with God and
   with men and have prevailed," even so has Grace ennobled us!

   It may be that we wear today the common well-worn garb of labor. Our
   names never glitter in the rolls of earth's mightiest--but we are
   allied unto the King of kings if the life of God is in our soul! We are
   of the royal family! We are princes of the blood imperial! We shall
   take our seats among those lordly spirits who forever dwell before the
   Majesty of the Most High. Priests and kings unto our God has Christ
   made us by virtue of His own position. Oh, to think that we, who were
   worse than dogs, should sit among the children! That we, who once stood
   at the swine trough and gladly would have filled our belly with the
   husks, now feed upon the fatted calf!

   What love is this, that whereas we said, "I am not worthy that you
   should come under my roof," He has been pleased to make our bodies the
   temples of the Holy Spirit and God dwells in us and we in Him! My
   Brethren, what an honor to be one with Christ--to be united to the
   Person of Him who counts it not robbery to be equal with God--to be
   made at last to sit upon His Throne, even as He sits upon His Father's
   Throne! Why, when I look upon the dignity which belongs to the meanest
   Christian, the imperial pomp of all emperors and kings sinks into
   insignificance and like a shadow melts away. Think of this, my
   Brethren, and despite your low state of Grace this morning, take
   comfort. He would not have made you such mighty ones as you are in Him
   if He had not intended to bless you still.

   4. Furthermore, the text conducts us onward to notice the creating and
   sustaining energy of that Grace. "Thus says the Lord that made you and
   formed you from the womb." How did you become Believers in Christ? By
   any internal energy of your own? Speak, Believer--was it your free will
   that brought you to the Savior's feet, or was it God's Free Grace? Men
   may hold free will doctrine as a matter of theory, but you never find a
   Believer hold it as a matter of experience. We can all say--

   "Oh, to Grace how great a debtor Daily I'm constrained to be."

   It was all of Your Grace I was brought to obey, while others were
   suffered to go the downward road! About this you can have no
   difficulty, for your own experience tells you that you were dead in
   trespasses and sins and it must have been something beyond any power of
   yours that quickened you into spiritual life. Men might as well claim
   the honors of creation or resurrection as boast of commencing their own
   spiritual life! The Lord alone shall have the Glory of that opening
   hour of love.

   Since that happy day what has sustained you? Has your fire of piety
   been fed by internal, self-produced fuel? Have you kept yourselves from
   the power of Satan? My Brethren, have you kept yourselves in communion
   with God? You know that you have not. You are debtors for your soul's
   daily bread to your Father who is in Heaven. Every good thing which you
   have you have received from Him. The great Father of Lights, with whom
   is no variableness or shadow of turning, has given you every good and
   perfect gift which you have received. You have profited in nothing by
   the flesh, but in all things by the Spirit of the living God.

   Taking you from your first conviction and tracking you to the present
   moment, it has been God's creating and forming. In the womb of
   conviction He fashioned you and He has nurtured you until now. Let this
   be your comfort--if God could quicken you when you were absolutely dead
   and if He has kept you until this moment, can He not revive you again?
   Can He not make that spark again become a flame? Have you fallen too
   low for Him? Is His arm shortened that He cannot save? Is His ear heavy
   that He cannot hear? No! He that has delivered you aforetime will
   deliver you yet again. Therefore be of good comfort.

   5. We will leave this part of the subject when we notice once again
   that this Grace has the characteristic of intense affection in it. This
   is not very plain in our translation but I think we can make it clear.
   God gives to His people the title of Jesurun, which means the righteous
   people, according to some translators. But most interpreters are agreed
   that it is an affectionate title which God gives to His people. Perhaps
   it may be considered to be a diminutive of Israel. I do not know that
   we could pronounce it so as to make it plainly appear here, but very
   likely it is so--a diminutive of Israel.

   Just as fathers and mothers, when they have great affection for their
   children, will frequently give them an endearing name--shorten their
   usual name--or call them by a familiar title only used in the family,
   so in calling Israel, Jesurun, the Lord sets forth His near and dear
   love. God's Grace to us is not merely the mercy of the good Samaritan
   towards a poor stranger whom he finds wounded by the way. It is the
   love of a mother to her sick child. The fondness of a husband towards a
   weeping wife. The tenderness of the head towards the wounded members.

   Beloved, did you ever did try to grasp the thought that God loves you?
   Whenever I try it, it brings tears into my eyes and I can go no
   farther. That the Eternal God should pity me I can understand. That He
   should regard my misery and deliver me I can comprehend. That He should
   look upon me with eyes of benevolence seems reasonable enough. But that
   He should LOVE me? Love me, too, with a love infinitely stronger than
   any love I have to my own children, or to my own spouse! That He should
   so love me that His own darling Son, the Only-Begotten, was not better
   loved than I have been--this is a wonder of wonders!

   1 must not say that Jesus was not so well loved as poor sinful men, but
   I will say when the question came to this-- whether those poor sinful
   but beloved ones should die or Christ should die--He spared not His own
   Son, but freely delivered Him up for us all. Oh, what mysterious love!
   That Christ should suffer that we may go free! That the Father's
   Darling should hang upon the accursed Tree and bleed away His life that
   we might be received into the eternal bosom of Jehovah and might be
   forever accepted as the favored ones of His electing love! He loves
   you! Oh, there is nothing can melt the heart like this--God loves you!

   And while it melts, it strengthens. While God loves me, whom shall I
   fear? If Jehovah has chosen me, if He has set His heart upon me, of
   whom shall I be afraid? Verily, with this I may walk through the valley
   of the shadow of death and fear no evil! With this in the midst of war
   I may have confidence! Upon this in famine I shall be fed. And in
   affliction I shall not be afraid. Oh, the joy which dwells in the
   thought that God loves His people! Jesus loved me and gave Himself for
   me! Can you say this, my Hearer? If you can, you can say more than
   Demosthenes or Cicero were ever able to say with all their eloquence.

   It may be, as we have said before, that we have fallen into a low sad
   state this morning and are trying to get ourselves out of it by
   chastening ourselves with many dark and doleful fears. Now that is not
   the way to rise from the dust. It is not the Law but the Gospel which
   saves at first. And it is not a legal bondage but a Gospel liberty
   which can restore the fainting Believer. It is not slavish fear that
   brings back the backslider to God, but the sweet wooing of love allures
   him to Jesus' bosom.

   As I sat the other night in my study, musing on my message for the
   coming Sunday, some little unbelief crossed my mind. Would the Lord
   sustain me in my ministry among such multitudes? Would He give fresh
   matter on the morrow? And there stood on my shelves nine volumes of my
   sermons, the records of nine years of gracious help. What witnesses did
   those volumes seem to be of the faithfulness of the Lord! Now you can
   look back, some of you, to ten, twenty, thirty, or forty years, which
   are like so many volumes of Grace received! Dare you distrust your God?
   David went forth to fight Goliath with past experience as his comfort,
   "Your servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised
   Philistine shall be as one of them."

   Cannot you use the same argument? You have already slain your
   adversaries--what can stand against you? Be of good comfort and dash
   forward to the fray! Take as your war cry, "His mercy endures forever,"
   and you need never quail, whatever difficulties assail you. So much for
   the first point. Now let us turn with great brevity to the second.

   II. We are encouraged, in the second place, this morning, by THE
   PROMISE OF WHAT GOD WILL DO. He says "Fear not, I will help you." And
   then He adds, "I will pour water upon him that is thirsty and floods
   upon the dry ground." You feel thirsty this morning, that is,
   uncomfortable in heart. You have lost much of the joy of religion and
   your prayer is, "Restore unto me the joy of Your salvation."

   You are conscious, also, that you are barren, like the dry ground. You
   are not bringing forth that fruit unto God which He has a right to
   expect of you. You are not so useful in the Church nor in the world as
   your heart desires to be. Well then, here is His promise of what He
   will do, "I will help you." You cannot pray this morning. You cannot
   wrestle as you desire--"I will help you." You feel unable to overcome
   sin--"I will help you." You are engaged in service too heavy for
   you--"I will help you."

   Whether it is to suffer, to sacrifice, to labor, or to endure, take
   this comfort--"I will help you." I love this promise! It is a very
   short one, but it is all the longer in meaning because it is short in
   expression. You may avail yourself of it in all cases. The promise
   turns every way and blesses in every form. It is like a weapon which
   may be used for fifty purposes. It will be to you, if you will, a sword
   and you may beat it into a plowshare. Or it will prove a shield, a
   spear, a chariot, and I know not what besides. You cannot find any
   possible position into which the child of God can be brought in which
   this promise will fail to bless him!

   Sit down no longer in lethargy! Lift up the hands which hang down and
   confirm the feeble knees, for if God says, "I will help you," how can
   you be afraid? Then comes a promise, fuller in words and as rich in
   Grace, "I will pour water on him that is thirsty." You shall have the
   Grace you want. Water refreshes the thirsty--you shall be
   refreshed--your desires shall be gratified. Water quickens sleeping
   vegetable life--your life shall be quickened by fresh Grace. Water
   swells the buds and makes the fruits ripe--you shall have fructifying
   Grace. You shall be made fruitful in the ways of God!

   Whatever good quality there is in Divine Grace, you shall enjoy it to
   the full. All the riches of Divine Grace you shall receive in plenty.
   You shall be, as it were, drenched with it! And as sometimes the
   meadows become flooded by the bursting rivers and the fields turn into
   pools, so shall you! The thirsty land shall be springs of water. O my
   Brothers and Sisters, when the Holy Spirit visits a man, what a
   difference it makes in him!

   I know a preacher, once as dull and dead a man as ever misused a
   pulpit. Under his slumbering ministrations there were few conversions
   and the congregation grew thinner and thinner. Good men sighed in
   secret and the enemy said, "Aha, so would we have it!" The revival
   came--the Holy Spirit worked gloriously! The preacher felt the Divine
   fire and suddenly woke up to energy and zeal. The man appeared to be
   transformed! His tongue seemed touched with fire! Elaborate and written
   discourses were laid aside and he began to talk out of his own glowing
   heart to the hearts of others. He preached as he had never done before.
   The place filled. The dry bones were stirred and quickening began! They
   who knew him once so elegant, correct, passionless, dignified, cold,
   lifeless and unprofitable, asked in amazement, "Is Saul also among the
   Prophets?"

   The Spirit of God is a great wonder-worker! You will notice certain
   Church members. They have never been good for much. We have had their
   names on the roll and that is all--suddenly the Spirit of God has come
   upon them and they have been honored among us for their zeal and
   usefulness! We have seen them here and there and everywhere diligent in
   the service of God and foremost in all sorts of Christian labor, though
   before you could hardly get them to stir an inch! I would that the
   quickening Spirit would come down upon me and upon you--upon every one
   of us in abundance--to create us valiant men for Truth and mighty for
   the Lord!

   O for some of the ancient valor of apostolic times, that, like good
   knights of the Cross we would dash forward against the foe and with
   irresistible courage deal heavy blows against the adversary of souls
   and his vast host! We may do this! We have only to plead the promise!
   God will be enquired of, but the promise stands true, "I will pour
   water upon him that is thirsty and floods upon the dry ground." Do not
   lose the blessing through remissness, but ask and you shall receive.
   Brethren, pray for me! For I need more Grace and in return I will plead
   the Lord's words on your behalf.

   III. As a very great comfort to His mourning people, the Lord now
   promises A BLESSING UPON THEIR CHILDREN. You will observe, dear
   Friends, that they must get the blessing for themselves first, for the
   third verse has it--"I will pour water upon him that is thirsty and
   floods upon the dry ground"--that is first. And then afterwards--"I
   will pour My Spirit upon your seed."

   We must not expect to see our children blessed unless we ourselves grow
   in Grace. It is often the inconsistency of parents which is the
   obstacle--the outward obstacle to the conversion of their children. No
   doubt there have been multitudes of children of professing parents who
   have been damned instrumentally by the ungodliness and inconsistency of
   their parents at home. The parents, let us hope, were Christians--but
   there has been so much of apparent inconsistency about them that the
   ruin of their children has been the consequence. It is a notorious fact
   that some of the worst of men have been the children of godly parents.
   I could give living instances but I forbear.

   When good Mr. Williams was murdered at Eromanga--the fact should be
   well-known--the natives had first been exasperated by the most
   abominable conduct on the part of the son of a missionary, who, having
   gone there, had practiced all sorts of evil upon the natives. And then
   good Mr. Williams was sacrificed to their fury. You will find that
   among the most fearfully depraved there are a few of the very deepest
   dye who received an early Christian education and dashed down all its
   restraints that they might run greedily into iniquity.

   I think the children of godly parents are like Jeremiah's figs--the
   good are very good, but the bad are very bad-- very naughty figs, such
   as cannot be eaten. Some of the children of God have been the parents
   of great offenders. Eli begets Hophni and Phinehas. David has an
   Absalom. Noah is father to Ham. Isaac begets profane Esau. The wise
   Solomon is followed by Rehoboam the fool. And pious Hezekiah is sire to
   persecuting Manasseh. Oh, how sad it is that it should be so, but so it
   is! We must, therefore, look to ourselves and our own careful walking
   before God, for we shall not get the promise for our offspring till we
   obtain its fulfillment in our own case.

   But now, supposing that this is done. If we have had faith to receive
   much Grace from God, here comes a blessed promise for our children--"I
   will pour My Spirit upon your seed," in which, observe first of all,
   the need. Our children need the Spirit of God. They are not like
   children educated in the street, the tavern, or the low theater. They
   have not heard from our lips words of lust or profanity. They have been
   hushed to sleep by the name of Jesus as their lullaby. They breathe the
   air of religion. But for all that they need the Spirit of God!

   We love to see the children of godly parents brought into Church
   membership, but we would avoid, above all things, anything like
   hereditary profession or inherited religion. It must be personal in
   each individual or it is not worth a gnat. I believe that the idea of
   birthright membership has tended materially to weaken the strength of
   that most respectable and once powerful denomination, the Society of
   Friends. Believing that their children have an inward Light which they
   ought to follow, I do fear they often teach their children to follow
   inward darkness rather than light. Forgetting the necessity of the Holy
   Spirit, which is infinitely superior to ordinary light of conscience,
   their children have grown up to attend meetings and to wear a
   particular garb without receiving the Spirit--certainly without that
   grand enthusiasm which honored their sires in bygone days.

   We must not adulterate our membership by the reception of the children
   of godly parents unless we have clear proof that they, themselves, are
   converted to God. Your children need the Holy Spirit quite as much as
   the offspring of the Hottentot or the Kaffir. They are born in sin and
   shapen in iniquity--in sin do the best of mothers conceive their
   children, and, however well you may train them, you cannot take the
   stone out of the heart nor turn it into flesh. To give a new heart and
   a right spirit is the work of the Holy Spirit and of the Holy Spirit
   alone.

   In the second place, the source of the mercy which God will give. "I
   will pour out My Spirit." It was the work of the Spirit which
   transformed their fathers--it is that which must transform them. The
   Word may come to them and not be blessed. We may be silly enough to
   take them to baby-Baptism and they would not be blessed. We may
   persuade them to come to the Lord's Table, but they would not be
   blessed. But when the Spirit of God comes upon them, then it is all
   done. Now comes the broken heart! Now comes the humble spirit! Now is
   breathed the earnest prayer! Now love to Christ flames forth and trust
   is built upon Him!

   Do pray, dear Friends, for your children, that God will pour His Spirit
   upon them. And as to the rest, you may depend that all the fruits will
   come in due time. I do not know that the parent needs to say much to
   his child about Baptism or the Lord's Supper, except, sometimes, a
   gentle word as to the duty of the Believer, and a clear explanation of
   the meaning of the ordinances. But I do hold that the duty of the
   parent is to look first and foremost for the work of the Spirit and
   insist upon it that he must be born again or else no profession can be
   made. Tell the child that he his dead in trespasses and sins. Let there
   be no doubt about his natural condition and let this always be your
   prayer, "Almighty Grace, renew his heart! Turn him from darkness to
   Light and make him Yours!"

   I think that in some Sunday school addresses there is not always the
   Gospel so clearly and decidedly proclaimed as it should be. It is not
   very easy, I know, to preach Christ to little children, but there is
   nothing else worth preaching. To stand up and say, "Be good boys and
   girls and you will get to Heaven," is preaching the old Covenant of
   Works, and it is no more right to preach salvation by works to little
   children than to those who are of mature age. We are all dead and as
   the Spirit of God can alone renew us, so He alone can renew them and
   there is no natural goodness, no amiability, no generosity of character
   which can supersede the work of the Holy Spirit. We must remember this
   and hold to it, that we pray to God to work by His Spirit in their
   hearts.

   Then you have in the promise in the third place, the plenty of Grace
   which God gives. He says, "I will pour My Spirit upon your seed"--not a
   little of it--but they shall have abundance. It has charmed me,
   especially of late, when I have conversed with very many children--many
   of them children of godly parents and others we have brought into our
   school and instructed by good and loving teachers. I have been charmed,
   I say, in examining them for membership, at the profoundness of their
   knowledge and the abundance of their Grace. I have questioned them in a
   way I would not question some gray-headed men and women.

   I have gone into points of intricate doctrine with many of them in a
   way which I would not use with many of middle age because I know I
   would take them out of their depth. But these children have been able
   to tell me from Scripture-- and generally their answers have been
   quotations of a text--the great plan of salvation and the doctrines
   connected with it as explicitly as the best Doctor of Divinity in any
   of our Universities. And I have been often pleased to notice that the
   very babes are those out of the mouths of whom God has ordained
   strength and He gives the perfect wisdom of the upright full often to
   those who are but as babes and sucklings. It is so good to notice this!

   You are not to expect children merely to exhibit faint traces of Grace,
   but in the strength of this promise you may look for great things. In
   the deathbeds of your children--and very often children who are early
   saved are early caught up to Heaven--many very wonderful expressions
   have fallen from their lips. Mr. Janeway, in his, "Token for Children,"
   has preserved many examples, showing that some dying children have been
   wondrously mature in piety and the expressions they have used have
   perfectly astounded the most experienced of the saints.

   You ought not, in the case of children, to look merely for life--you
   will find vigorous life! You may not expect a little surface-knowledge
   only, but you may expect to find in them a depth of knowledge in the
   things of God, for so God's promise has it, "I will pour My Spirit upon
   your seed." I must not leave the text without noticing the blessedness
   of all this. "And My blessing upon your offspring."

   Oh, what a blessing it is to have our offspring saved! God give us each
   to see it! What a blessing to have our children enlisted in Christ's
   army! Beloved, we wish them well, we wish them the best of God's gifts.
   But if we were asked whether we would have them famous or wealthy, we
   should pause to ask whether it were good for them. But if it were put
   to us, "Shall they be saved?" we feel we would cheerfully give our life
   if that must be the price, to know that our children walked in the
   Truth of God. "I have no greater joy than this," said one in Holy
   Scripture and there can be no greater joy than this to the Christian
   parent. How happy the family becomes!

   And when they grow up and go out from us, married in the Lord--for how
   else can they be gracious?--we should expect to see a gracious house
   built up. There is a very sad verse, I think you will find it in the
   second chapter of Judges, which runs thus--"And also all that
   generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another
   generation after them, which knew not the Lord, nor yet the works which
   He had done for Israel." Oh, that is sad to see how soon religion dies
   out in a nation! But without household piety--without constant
   instruction both in the Sunday school and at home--the next generation
   in our case will be as ignorant of God as if Christ had not been known
   by their fathers!

   Unless we are careful over the young, there may be none to bear the
   Lord's banner when we sleep among the clods. In matters of doctrine you
   will find orthodox congregations frequently change to heterodoxy in the
   course of thirty or forty years and that is because too often there has
   been no catechizing of the children in the essential doctrines of the
   Gospel. For my part I am more and more persuaded that the study of a
   good Scriptural Catechism is of infinite value to our children and I
   shall see that it is reprinted as cheaply as possible for your use.
   Even if the youngsters do not understand all the questions and answers
   in the "Westminster Assembly's Catechism," yet, abiding in their
   memories, it will be of infinite service when the time of understanding
   comes, to have known those very excellent, wise and judicious
   definitions of the things of God.

   If we would maintain orthodoxy in our midst and see good old
   Calvinistic doctrines handed down from father to son, I think we must
   use the method of catechizing and endeavor with all our might to
   impregnate their minds with the things of God. It will be a blessing to
   them--the greatest of all blessings--a blessing in life and death, in
   time and eternity, the best of blessings God Himself can give. I will
   not prolong this, but there are still two points I must mention.

   Carefully notice the vigor with which these children shall grow. "They
   shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water courses."

   Close by the water's edge the grass grows very green and the willow is
   a well-known tree for speedily shooting forth its branches. Our farmers
   lop their willows often, but they very soon sprout again. As the old
   proverb has it, "A willow will buy a horse where an oak will not buy a
   saddle, because the willow being often lopped and then springing again,
   yields much to the grower." The willow grows fast and so do young
   Christians. If you want the eminent men in God's Church, look for them
   among those converted in youth. There are, of course, exceptions, but
   after all, our Samuels and Timothy's must come from those who knew the
   Scriptures from their youth.

   O Lord! Send us many such whose growth and advance shall as much
   astonish us as the growth of the willows by the water courses. Why,
   since I have been among you these ten years and more, lads who used to
   come into the school and were the objects of our hope, where are they
   now? Why they are preaching the Gospel this very morning! And as I look
   at the happy parents here and remember the time when the now useful
   minister sat as a lad in the pew and remember that at this very moment
   they are preaching in the name of Jesus, they do seem to have grown
   quite as fast as the willows. They grow so fast and so well and serve
   the Lord so admirably! The promise has, indeed, been fulfilled to the
   very letter!

   Then comes, last of all, the manifestation of this in public. It
   appears from the text that not only are our children to have the Spirit
   of God in their inward parts, but they are to make a profession of it.
   One shall say, "I am the Lord's"-- he shall come out boldly and avow
   himself on the Lord's side. And another shall so ally himself to God's
   Church that he "shall call himself by the name of Jacob." And then
   another who can hardly speak quite so positively, but who means it
   quite as sincerely--"shall subscribe with his hand unto the Lord," and
   a fourth shall, "surname himself by the name of Israel."

   Oh, it is a joy, indeed, when those who know the Lord come forward and
   declare themselves to be on His side! May we, by God's Grace, be helped
   to train our children to an open avowal of that which is within them. A
   hint sometimes will do our sons and daughters good when we believe that
   they fear God. Indicate to them that religion is not meant to be kept
   under a bushel, that the Grace of God is not to be covered and
   concealed--and before long, seeing their duty-- God will help them to
   walk in the way of it and it shall be your privilege and mine to
   rejoice at seeing them added to the Church. The promise upon which I
   have preached this morning needs to be pleaded before God, for God does
   not fulfill such promises as these without our bringing them before Him
   in earnest fervent prayer.

   A banker gives me a check and it is a very good one, but I can never
   get the cash for it without going to the counter and presenting it for
   payment. And if God gives me a promise conditional upon my pleading it,
   I must never expect Him to fulfill it unless I enquire concerning it. I
   look upon some here who can remember the way by which God has led
   them--who look upon their children and their children's children
   walking in the Truth of God--you, my Brethren, can confirm the faith of
   the younger parents among us and make us feel that as God has dealt
   well with you, He will deal well with us!

   Some of us, in looking back, can speak of a godly father and a godly
   grandfather. We can look for generations back, till as far as we can
   trace a line--Divine Grace has run in our family. O that the line may
   continue for years to come, till as long as generations are born there
   shall be one of our kith and kin to carry the standard and sound the
   trumpet and fight for the Lord of Israel! I invite you, therefore, to
   much earnest prayer, especially during the coming week, which is
   selected by the Evangelical Alliance as a prayer week for this special
   object. And I trust with regard to this promise none will be backward
   in pleading it.

   As for you who are unconverted, you cannot pray for your children if
   you do not pray for yourselves. You never can expect a blessing, for
   you are under the Divine curse! Nevertheless I pray God to make you
   thirsty and if He makes you hunger and thirst after righteousness, then
   you can put your hand upon this promise, "I will pour water upon him
   that is thirsty and floods upon the dry ground." And afterwards the
   remainder of the blessing shall be yours. God bless the Word for Jesus'
   sake. Amen.--

   "Wake, parents of Israel!
   O hasten to plead
   For the Spirit of Grace to descend.
   The Word has gone forth and the faithful have need
   Of your prayers the great cause to defend.
   From the youth of our country shall armies arise,
   The Gospel of peace to proclaim.
   Over the land and the seas, the glad message that flies,
   Shall re-echo Immanuel's name.
   Wake, parents in Israel!
   O, wrestle and pray
   That Grace to our youth may be given
   For the hands that in faith are uplifted today
   Shall prevail with our Father in Heaven."

                              The Great Liberator

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, APRIL 17, 1864, BY THE REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "If the Son therefore shall make you free, you shall be free, indeed."

   John 8:36.

   BLESSED is that word "free," and blessed is he who spends himself to
   make men so. You did well to crowd your streets and to welcome with
   your joyous acclamations the man who has broken the yoke from off the
   neck of the oppressed. Many sons of Italy have done valiantly, but he
   excels them all and deserves the love of all the good and brave.
   Political slavery is an intolerable evil. To live, to think, to act, to
   speak at the permission of another! Better have no life at all! To
   depend for my existence upon a despot's will is death itself. Craven
   spirits may wear the dog collar which their master puts upon them and
   fawn at his feet for the bones of his table, but men who are worthy of
   the name had rather feed the vultures on the battlefield.

   The burden of civil bondage is too heavy for bold spirits to bear with
   patience and therefore they fret and murmur beneath it. This murmuring
   the tyrant loves not and therefore he throws the sufferers into his
   dungeons and bids them wear out their days in captivity. Blessed is he
   who hurls down the despot, bursts the doors of his dungeons and gives
   true men their rights. We have never felt, and therefore we know not
   the bitterness of bondage. Our emancipators have gone to the world of
   spirits, bequeathing us an heirloom of liberty for which we should love
   their names and reverence their God.

   If they could have lived on till now, how we should honor them! But as
   they are gone, we do well to applaud our illustrious guest as if we saw
   in him the spirit of all our glorious liberators worthily enshrined.
   Political liberty allows scope for so much of all that is good and
   ennobling and its opposite involves so much that is debasing, that the
   mightiest nation destitute of it is poor, indeed, and the poorest of
   all people, if they are but free, are truly rich. But, my Brethren, men
   may have political liberty to the very fullest extent and yet be
   slaves, for there is such a thing as religious bondage. He who cringes
   before a priest--he who dreads his anathema, or who creeps at his feet
   to receive his blessing--is an abject slave!

   He may call himself a free man, but his soul is in vile bondage if
   superstition makes him wear the chain. To be afraid of the mutterings
   of a man like myself--to bow before a piece of wood or a yard of
   painted canvas--to reverence a morsel of bread or a rotten bone--this
   is mental slavery, indeed! They call the Negro a slave in the Southern
   Confederacy, but men who prostrate their reason before the throne of
   superstition are slaves through and through. To yield obedience to our
   Lord, to offer prayer to God Most High is perfect freedom! But to
   confess my heart out to a mortal with a shaven crown--to trust my
   family secrets and my wife's character to the commands of a man who may
   be all the while wallowing in debauchery is worse than the worst form
   of serfdom.

   I would sooner serve the most cruel Sultan who ever crushed humanity
   beneath his iron heel than bow before the Pope or any other priest of
   man's making. The tyranny of priest-craft is the worst of ills. You may
   cut through the bonds of despots with a sword, but the sword of the
   Lord Himself is needed here. The Truth of God must file these fetters
   and the Holy Spirit must open these dungeons! You may escape from
   prison, but superstition hangs round a man and with its deadly
   influence keeps him ever in its dark and gloomy cell.

   Skepticism, which proposes to snap the chains of superstition only
   supplants a blind belief with an unhallowed credulity and leaves the
   victim as oppressed as ever. Jesus the Son, alone, can make men truly
   free! Happy are they whom He has delivered from superstition. Blessed
   are our eyes that this day we see the light of Gospel liberty and are
   no longer immured in Popish darkness! Let us remember our privileges
   and bless God with a loud voice that the darkness is past and the true
   Light shines--since the name of Jesus, the preaching of His Word, and
   the power of His Truth have, in this respect, in a high degree--made
   our nation free!

   Yet a man may be delivered from the bond of superstition and be still a
   serf, for he who is not ruled by a priest may still be controlled by
   the devil or by his own lusts which are much the same. Our carnal
   desires and inclinations are domineering lords enough, as those know
   who follow out their commands. A man may say, "I feel not supernatural
   terrors. I know no superstitious horrors," and then, folding his arms,
   he may boast that he is free. But he may all the while be a slave to
   his own evil heart. He may be grinding at the mill of avarice, rotting
   in the reeking dungeon of sensuality, dragged along by the chains of
   maddened anger, or borne down by the yoke of fashionable custom.

   He is the free man who is master of himself through the Grace of God.
   He who serves his own passions is the slave of the worst of despots.
   Talk to me not of dark dungeons beneath the sea level! Speak not to me
   of pits in which men have been entombed and forgotten! Tell me not of
   heavy chains, nor even of racks and the consuming fire. The slave of
   sin and Satan, sooner or later, knows greater horrors than these--his
   doom is more terrible because it is eternal--and his slavery more
   hopeless because it is one into which he willingly commits himself.

   Perhaps there are those present who claim liberty for themselves and
   say that they are able to control their passions and have never given
   away to impure desires. Yes, a man may get as far as that in a modified
   sense and yet not be free. Perhaps I address those who, knowing the
   right, have struggled for it against the wrong. You have reformed
   yourselves from follies into which you had fallen. You have, by
   diligence, brought the flesh somewhat under control in its outward
   manifestations of sin, and now your life is moral, your conduct is
   respectable, your reputation high. Still, for all that it may be that
   you are conscious that you are not free.

   Your old sins haunt you, your former corruptions perplex you. You have
   not found peace for you have not obtained forgiveness. You have buried
   your sins beneath the earth for years, but conscience has given them a
   resurrection and the ghosts of your past transgressions haunt you. You
   can scarcely sleep at night because of the recollection of the wrath of
   God which you deserve. And by day there is a gall put into your
   sweetest draughts because you know that you have sinned against Heaven
   and that Heaven must visit with vengeance your transgression. You have
   not yet come to the full liberty of the children of God, as you will do
   if you cast yourselves into the hands of Jesus who looses the captives.

   "If the Son therefore shall make you free, you shall be free,
   indeed"--free as the mere political liberator cannot make you--free as
   he cannot make you who merely delivers you from superstition! Free as
   reformation cannot make you. Free as God alone can make you by His free
   Spirit. "If the Son therefore shall make you free, you shall be free,
   indeed."

   Now this morning may the Lord give His servant help from on high while
   I try to talk with you. To those who feel today their slavery, my
   message may be profitable. Our first point is that to those who are the
   bond slaves of Satan, liberty is possible. The text would not mock us
   with a dream--it says, "If the Son therefore shall make you free." All
   who are slaves shall not be set free, but there is the possibility of
   liberty implied in the text. Blessed "if." It is like the prison window
   through the stony wall--it lets in enough sunshine for us to read the
   word, "hope." "If the Son therefore shall make you free."

   Secondly, there is a false freedom. You see that in the text--"You
   shall be free, indeed." There were some who professed to be free, but
   were not so. The Greek is, "You shall be free really," for there are
   some who are free only in the name and in the shadow of freedom, but
   who are not free as to the substance. Then thirdly, real freedom must
   come to us from the Son, that glorious Son of God, who, being free and
   giving Himself to us, gives us freedom. And then we shall close by
   putting a few personal questions as to whether the Son has made us
   free, or whether we still remain slaves.

   I. First then, dear Friends, our text rings a sweet silver bell of hope
   in the ear of those who are imprisoned by their sin. FREEDOM IS
   POSSIBLE--the word "if implies it. The Son of God can make the prisoner
   free. No matter who you are, nor what you are, nor how many years you
   may have remained the slaves of Satan--the Son, the glorious
   Liberator--can make you free. "He is able also to save them to the
   uttermost, who come unto God by Him."

   Perhaps that which weighs upon you most heavily is a sense of your past
   guilt. "I have offended God--I have offended often, willfully,
   atrociously, with many aggravations. On such-and-such a day I offended
   Him in the foulest manner and with deliberation. On other days I have
   run greedily in a course of vice. Nothing has restrained me from
   disobedience and nothing has impelled me to the service of God. All
   that His Word says against me I deserve. And every threat which His
   Book utters is justly due to me and may well be fulfilled. Is there a
   possibility that I can escape from guilt? Can so foul a sinner as I am
   be made clean? I know that the leopard cannot lose its spots, nor the
   Ethiopian change his skin by his own efforts. Is there a Divine power
   which can take away my spots and change my nature?"

   Sinner, there is! No sin which you have committed need shut you out of
   Heaven. However damnable your iniquities may have been, there is
   forgiveness with God that He may be feared. You may have gone to the
   very verge of perdition, but the arm of God's Grace is long enough to
   reach you. You may sit today with your tongue padlocked with blasphemy,
   your hands fast bound by acts of atrocious violence, your heart
   fettered with corruption, your feet chained fast to the Satanic blocks
   of unbelief--your whole self locked up in the bondage of
   corruption--but there is One so mighty to save that He can set even
   you, free! "All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto
   men."

   "The blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin." In the
   matter of guilt, then, there is the possibility of freedom. "But can I
   be freed from the punishment of sin?" says another. "God is just: He
   must punish sin. It is not possible that the Judge of all the earth
   should allow such a rebel as I am to escape. Shall I go Scot free?
   Shall I have the same reward with the perfectly righteous? After years
   of unbelief am I still to be treated as though I had always been a
   willing and loving child? This is not just--I must be punished."

   Sinner, there is no need that you should be cast into Hell. No, you
   shall not be, if your trust is placed in the blood shed on Calvary.
   There is an imperative need that sin should be punished, but there is
   no need that it should be punished in your person. The stern laws of
   Justice demand that sin should meet with satisfaction, but there is no
   Law which demands that it should receive satisfaction from you, for if
   you believe, Christ has given satisfaction for you. If you trust Jesus
   Christ to save you, be assured that Christ was punished in your place,
   and suffered the whole of Divine wrath, so that there is no fear of
   your being cast into Hell.

   If you believe, you cannot be punished, for there is no charge against
   you--your sins having been laid on Christ. And there can be no
   punishment exacted from you, for Christ has already discharged the
   whole. God's justice cannot demand two executions for the same offense.
   O, let not the flames of Hell alarm you, Sinner! Let not Satan provoke
   you to despair by thoughts of the worm that never dies and of the fire
   that never can be quenched. You need not go there--there is a
   possibility of deliverance for you. And though your heart says, "Never,
   never, shall I escape," trust not your heart! God is greater than your
   heart and knows all things.

   Believe His testimony and fly to the great Deliverer for liberty!
   Freedom, then, from punishment is possible through Christ. I think I
   hear one say, "Ah, but if I were saved from past sin and from all the
   punishment of it, yet still I should submit to the power of sin again.
   I have a wolf within my heart hungering after sin which will not be
   satisfied, though it is glutted with evil. The insatiable horseleech of
   my lust ever cries, 'Give, give!' Can I be delivered from it? I have
   been bound with many resolutions, but sin, like Samson, has snapped
   them as though they were but green twigs. I have been shut up in many
   professions, as though I was now, once and for all, a prisoner to
   morality. But I have taken up posts and bars and every other restraint
   which kept me in and I have gone back to my old uncleanness. Can /, can
   I be saved from all these propensities, and all this inbred
   corruption?"

   My dear Friend, there is a hope for you that you may be. If you believe
   in the Lord Jesus Christ, that same blood by which sin is pardoned
   enables man to overcome sin. They in Heaven washed their robes and made
   them white in His blood. But they have another note in their song--they
   overcame through the blood of the Lamb. Not only were they delivered
   from guilt, but from the power of sin. I do not tell you that in this
   life Christ Himself will make you perfectly free from indwelling
   sin--there will always be some corruption left in you to struggle
   with--some Canaanite still in the land to exercise your faith and to
   teach you the value of a Savior. But the neck of sin shall be under
   your foot--God shall lead captive the great Adonibezek of your lust and
   you shall cut off his thumbs so that he cannot handle weapons of war.

   If the enemy cannot be destroyed, at least his head shall be broken and
   he shall never have reigning power over you--you shall be free from
   sin, to live no longer in it. Oh, that blessed word "if"! How it
   sparkles! It may seem but a little star--may it herald the dawning of
   the Sun of Righteousness within you--"If the Son therefore shall make
   you free."

   "Oh," says one, "that is a great 'if,' indeed. It cannot be! My guilt
   pardoned, my punishment remitted, and my nature changed? How can it
   be?" Dear Friend, it may be, and I trust it will be this morning, for
   this "if" comforts the preacher with a hope of success in delivering
   the Word. And may it give some hope to the hearers, that perhaps you
   may be made free yourselves. But I think I hear another exclaim, "Sir,
   I am in bondage through fear of death. Go where I may, enjoying no
   assurance of acceptance in Christ, I am afraid to die. I know that I
   must one of these days close these eyes in the slumbers of the grave,
   but oh, it is a dread thought to me that I must stand before my God and
   pass the solemn test. I cannot look into the sepulcher without feeling
   that it is a cold, damp place. I cannot think of eternity without
   remembering the terrors which cluster round it to a sinner, 'where
   their worm dies not and where their fire is not quenched.' "

   Ah, but my dear Friend, if the Son makes you free, He will deliver you
   from the fear of death. When sin is pardoned then the Law is satisfied
   and when the Law is satisfied then death becomes a friend. The strength
   of sin is the Law--the Law is fulfilled--the strength of sin is broken.
   The sting of death is sin--sin is pardoned--death has a sting no
   longer. If you believe in Christ you shall never die in that sense in
   which you dread death. You shall fall asleep but you shall never die.
   That death of which you think is not the Christian's portion--it
   belongs to the ungodly. In it you shall have no share, if you trust the
   Savior. Borne on angels' wings to Heaven--up from calamity,
   imperfection, temptation and trial shall you mount--flitting with the
   wings of a dove far above the clouds of sorrow! Leaving this dusky
   globe behind you, you shall enter into the splendors of immortality.
   You shall not die, but wake out of this dying world into a life of
   Glory!

   Come, Soul! If you trust in Christ, this "if shall be no if, but a
   certainty today--the Son shall make you free, indeed. I do not think I
   can bring out the full value of this liberty by merely speaking of the
   evils which we are delivered from. You know, Brethren, freedom consists
   not only in a negative but in a positive--we are not only free from,
   but we are free to. We hear of persons receiving the freedom of a city.
   This implies that certain privileges are bestowed. Now, "if the Son
   therefore shall make you free, you shall be free, indeed," in the sense
   of privilege--you shall be free to call yourself God's child. You shall
   be free to say, "Abba, Father," without rebuke. You shall be free to
   claim the protection of that Father's House and the provision of His
   bounty. You shall be free to come to His knees with all your trials and
   tell Him all your griefs.

   You shall be free to plead His promises and to receive the fulfillment
   of them, too. You shall be free to sit at His table, not as a servant
   is permitted sometimes to sit down when the feast is over to eat the
   leftovers, but you shall sit there as a well-beloved son, to eat the
   fatted calf while your Father with you, eats, drinks and is merry. You
   shall be free to enter into the Church on earth, the mother of us all.
   Free to all her ordinances. Free to share in all those gifts which
   Christ has given to his spouse. And when you die, you shall be free to
   enter into the rest which remains for the people of God. Free to
   partake of the New Jerusalem which is above. Free to use her harps of
   gold and to her streets ofjoy. Free to feast in her great banquet which
   lasts forever. Free access to the heart of God, to the throne of Christ
   and to the blessedness of eternity!

   Oh, how good it is to think that there is a possibility of a freedom to
   such privileges as these and a possibility of it to the vilest of the
   vile! For some who were grossly guilty, some who had gone far astray
   have nevertheless enjoyed the fullness of the blessing of the Gospel of
   Peace. Look at Paul! No man enters more into the mystery of the Gospel
   than he. He had freedom to do so--he could comprehend with all saints
   what are the heights and depths, and know the love of Christ which
   passes knowledge and yet it is he, it is he who once foamed out
   threats, who sucked the blood of the saints! It is he who dyed his
   hands up to the very elbows in murderous gore. It is he who hated
   Christ! It is he who was a persecutor and injurious and yet is he free
   from evil and he is free to all the privileges of the chosen of God!

   And why not you? And why not you? Woman, tottering and trembling, why
   should not, why should not the Son make you free? Man, tossed about
   with many doubts, why should not the great Liberator appear to you? Can
   there be a reason why not? You have not read the rolls of
   predestination and discovered that your name has been left out. It has
   not been revealed that for you there is no Atonement, but it is
   revealed to you that whoever believes on Him is not condemned. And this
   is the testimony which comes to you--O that you would receive it!--"He
   that believes on the Lord Jesus Christ has everlasting life." O that
   you would be bold and trust Christ this morning and the "if which is in
   our text shall become a blessed certainty to you! So then there is a
   possibility for freedom. We will pause awhile and then warn you against
   false freedom.

   II. BEWARE OF FALSE LIBERTY. Every good thing is imitated by Satan who
   is the master of counterfeits and therefore, liberty--a word fit to be
   used in Heaven and almost too good for fallen earth--has been used for
   the very basest of purposes and men have misnamed the devil's offspring
   by this angelic title. We have in spiritual matters things called
   liberty which are not liberty. There is Antinomian liberty--God deliver
   us from that! A man says, "I am not under the Law of God, therefore I
   will live as I like." A most blessed Truth of God followed by a most
   atrocious inference.

   The Christian is not under the Law, but under Grace--that is a very
   precious fact--it is much better to serve God because we love Him, than
   because we are afraid of His wrath. To be under the Law is to give God
   the service of a slave who fears the lash. But to be under Grace is to
   serve God out of pure love to Him. Oh, to be a child and to give the
   obedience of a child and not the homage of a serf! But the Antinomian
   says, "I am not under the Law, therefore will I live and fulfill my own
   lusts and pleasures."

   Paul says of those who argue thus, their damnation is just. We have had
   the pain of knowing some who have said, "I am God's elect--Christ shed
   His blood for me--I shall never perish!" And then they have gone to the
   ale-house, they have sung the drunkard's song and have even used the
   drunkard's oath. What is this, dear Friends, but a strong delusion to
   believe a lie? They who can do this must surely have been some time in
   Satan's oven, to be baked so hard. Why, these must have had their
   consciences taken out of them! Are they not turned to something worse
   than brutes? The dog does not say, "My master feeds me and he will not
   destroy me, but is fond of me, therefore will I snarl at him or rend
   him"?

   Even the ass does not say, "My master gives me fodder, therefore will I
   dash my heels into his face." The ox knows its owner and the ass his
   master's crib, but these men only know God to provoke Him and they
   profess that His love to them gives them a liberty to rebel against His
   will! God deliver you from any such freedom as this! Be not legalists,
   but love the Law of God and in it make your delight. Abhor all idea of
   being saved by good works, but O, be as full of good works as if you
   were to be saved by them!

   Walk in holiness as if your own walking would make you enter into
   Heaven and then rest on Christ, knowing that nothing of your own can
   ever open the gate of the Celestial City. Eschew and abhor anything
   like Antinomianism. Do not be afraid of high doctrine. Men sometimes
   mislabel good sound Calvinism as Antinomianism. Do not be afraid of
   that--do not be alarmed at the ugly word Antinomianism if it does not
   exist! But the thing itself--flee from it as from a serpent! Shake off
   the venomous beast into the fire as Paul did the viper which he found
   among the firewood. When you are gathering up the doctrines of Grace to
   cheer and comfort you, this deadly viper gets into the midst and when
   the fire begins to burn, he comes out of the heat and fastens upon you.
   Shake him off into the fire of Divine Love and there let the monster be
   consumed!

   My Brethren, if we are loved of God with an everlasting love and are no
   more under the Law but free from its curse, let us serve God with all
   our heart's gratitude to Him. Let us say, "I am Your servant. I am Your
   servant and the son of Your handmaid--You have loosed my bonds." Let
   the loosing of our bonds be an argument for service. Then again,
   Beloved, there is another kind of freedom of which we must all be
   aware--it is a notional professional freedom. "Free? Yes, certainly we
   are. We are the people of God," say some. Not that they have ever
   passed from death unto life. Not that vital godliness is a matter they
   understand.

   No. "We always went to Church, or Chapel. We have never stopped going
   in our lives. We are the most regular of religious people and we were
   baptized, and we go to the sacrament and what is there that we do not
   do? Who convicts us of any sin? If we are not going to the Celestial
   City, who can be? Surely, surely, we enjoy much of the things of God!
   We sit in God's House and we feel a pleasure when we listen to the
   Truth of God. Sacred song bears us on high as well as other men. We sit
   as God's people sit and we hear as God's people hear--surely we are
   free!"

   Ah, but dear Friends, a man may think himself free and still be a
   slave. You know there are many in this world who dream themselves to be
   what they are not. And you have a faculty of dreaming in the same
   manner. Christ must have come to you and shown you your slavery and
   broken your heart on account of it, or else you are not free. And you
   must have looked to the wounds of Jesus as the only gates of your
   escape and have seen in His hands the only power which could snap your
   fetters or else, though you have professed and re-professed, you are as
   much slaves of Satan as though you were in the Pit itself!

   Beware, I pray you, of hereditary religion! A man cannot hand down his
   godliness as he does his goods. And I cannot receive Grace as I may
   receive lands, or gold, or silver. "You must be born again." There must
   be the going up out of Egypt, the leaving the flesh pots and the brick
   kilns, and advancing through the Red Sea of Atonement into the
   wilderness and afterwards into the promised rest. Have you passed from
   death unto life? If not, beware of having a mere notional, professional
   liberty!

   There are many, too, who have the liberty of natural self-righteousness
   and of the power of the flesh. They have fanciful, unfounded hopes of
   Heaven. They have never wronged anybody. They have never done any
   mischief in the world. They are amiable. They are generous to the poor.
   They are this, they are that, they are the other! Therefore they feel
   themselves to be free. They never feel their own inability. They can
   always pray alike and always sing alike. They have no changes. They are
   not emptied from vessel to vessel. Their confidence never wavers. They
   believe themselves all right and abide in their confidence.

   They do not stop to examine--their delusion is too strong and their
   comfort is much too precious for them to wish to mar it by looking to
   its foundation--so they go on, on, on--sound asleep till one of these
   days, falling over the awful precipice of ruin, they will wake up where
   waking will be too late! We know there are some such. They are in God's
   House, but they are not God's sons! You remember the case of Ishmael.
   It is to that which our Lord seems to allude here. Ishmael was a son of
   Abraham according to the flesh, but he never was free. His mother being
   a bondwoman, he was a slave.

   He might call himself Abraham's son if he could, but being only after
   the flesh he was still a slave, for it was not in the power of Abraham,
   in the power of the flesh, to beget anything but bondage. And Ishmael
   at his best was still the son of the bondwoman. Yet you see he sits at
   the table, he eats and drinks just as merrily as the child of the
   promise. No, in some things he is stronger than Isaac--he has the
   advantage of age and I dare say plumes himself on being heir. "Ah,"
   says he, "I am the elder one of the family." At last he mocked
   Isaac--when the boys were at their sports he was violent towards his
   younger brother, even as many Pharisees are very cruel to true
   Believers.

   What came of it? Why, "the servant abides not in the house forever, but
   the son abides forever," and so the day came in which Sarah said, "Cast
   out the bondwoman and her son," and away went Ishmael. He might cling
   to his father and say, "I am your son." "You must go, Sir, you are a
   slave. You were born after the flesh and therefore you take from your
   mother your state and condition and not from your father. Your mother
   was a bond slave and so are you and you must go. The privileges of the
   children's house are not for you. You must go into the wilderness. You
   cannot abide here." But Isaac, though feeble and tempted and tried and
   vexed, is never sent out of his father's house--never--he abides
   forever.

   This is the position of many. They are very good people in their way.
   They do their best, but what is their best? It is the offspring of the
   flesh. And that which is born of the flesh is flesh, Consequently their
   best endeavors only make them slaves in the house, not sons. Only he
   who is born by faith according to the promise is the free Isaac and
   abides in the house. The day will come when God will ask every member
   of the Christian Church and all who profess religion, "Are you children
   by faith in the promise or not?" And if you are only children according
   to the flesh He will send you back again into the wilderness--to
   eternal ruin you must go unless the Spirit of God has given you the
   spirit of freedom.

   There was a custom, observed among the Greeks and Romans that when a
   man died, if he left slaves, they went as a heritage to the elder son
   and if the elder son said, "Some of these are my own Brethren, though
   they are slaves, I therefore pronounced them free," they would be free.
   Emancipation was not always allowed in either Greek or Roman states--a
   man might not always set a slave free without giving a good reason. But
   it was always held to be a valid reason if the son, coming into a
   heritage of slaves, chose to set them free. No question was asked if
   the son made them free. The law did not step in.

   So, dear Friends, if the Son shall make us free, we shall be free,
   indeed. If Jesus Christ, the great Heir according to the promise, the
   great Mediator whom God has created Heir of all things, by whom also He
   made the worlds--if He shall say to us who are as Ishmael, "I make you
   free," then are we free, indeed! And neither Law, Justice, Heaven or
   Hell can bring any argument against us why we should not be free. But
   do beware of all imaginary freedoms and shun them as you would poison!
   And God give you Divine Grace to enjoy the glorious liberty of the
   children of God!

   III. TRUE FREEDOM COMES TO US THROUGH HIM WHO IS, IN THE HIGHEST SENSE,
   "THE SON." No man gets free except as he comes to Christ and takes Him
   to be his All in All. You may rivet on your fetters by going to the
   Law, to your own good works, to your willings and your praying and your
   doings, but you will never be free until you come to Christ. Mark you,
   Man, if you will come to Christ you shall be free this moment from
   every sort of bondage. But if you will go here and there, and try this
   and that and the other, you shall find all your trying will end in
   disappointment and you shall lie down in sorrow and in shame--for none
   but Jesus--none but Jesus--can make us free, indeed.

   Real liberty comes from Him only. Let us think awhile of this real
   liberty. Remember it is a liberty righteously bestowed. Christ has a
   right to make men free. If I should set a slave free who belongs to his
   master, he might run for a time--but since I had not the power to give
   him a legal emancipation--he would be dragged back again. But the Son,
   who is heir of all things, has a right to make him free whom He wills
   to make free. The Law is on Christ's side. Christ has such power in
   Heaven and earth committed to Him that if He says to the sinner, "You
   are free," free he is before high Heaven.

   Before God's great bar you can plead the word of Jesus and you shall be
   delivered! Think, too, how dearly this freedom was purchased. Christ
   speaks it by His power, but He still bought it by His blood. He makes
   you free, Sinner, but it is by His own bonds. You go free because He
   bore your burden for you. See Him bear His agony--"Crushed beneath the
   millstone of the Law till all His head, His hair, His garments were
   bloody." See Him yonder, dragged to Pilate's hall, bound, whipped like
   a common felon, scourged like a murderer and dragged away by hellhounds
   through the streets. Look at Him fastened by those cruel fetters which
   went through His flesh to the accursed wood. See Him yielding up His
   liberty to the dungeon of death.

   There the Mighty One sleeps in Joseph of Arimathea's tomb. Dearly did
   He purchase with His own bondage the liberty which He so freely gives.
   But, though dearly purchased, let us take up that keynote--He freely
   gives it! Jesus asks nothing of us as a preparation for this liberty.
   He finds us sitting in sackcloth and ashes and bids us put on the
   beautiful array of freedom. He discovers us in a darkness which may be
   felt, sitting in the valley of the shadow of death and He brings the
   true Light in His hand and turns our midnight into blazing noon and all
   without our help, without our merit, and at first without our will.

   Christ saves sinners just as they are! Christ died not for the
   righteous, but for the ungodly! His message is Grace, pure Grace,
   undiluted by a single condition or requisition which God might make of
   man. Just as you are, trust your soul with Christ and though there is
   in you no speck of anything that is good, He will save you and give you
   perfect liberty. Dearly has He bought it, but freely does He give
   it--even the faith by which we receive is the gift of God. It is a
   liberty which may be instantaneously received. The captive goes first
   through one door and then another and perhaps a hundred keys must grate
   in the wards of the lock before he feels the cool fresh air gladdening
   his brow.

   But it is not so with the man who believes! The moment you believe, you
   are free! You may have been chained at a thousand points, but the
   instant you believe in Christ you are unfettered and free as the bird
   of the air. Not more free is the eagle which mounts to his rocky nest
   and afterwards outsoars the clouds--even he, the bird of God--is not
   more unfettered than the soul which Christ has delivered! Cut are the
   cords and in an instant you are clear of all and upward you mount to
   God! You may have come in here a slave and you may go out free!

   God's Grace can, in a moment, give you the condition of freedom and the
   nature of it. He can make you say, "Abba, Father," with your whole
   heart, though up to this day you may have been of your father the
   devil, and his works you have done. In an instant is it worked! We are
   told in tropical lands that the sun seems to leap up from under the
   horizon and the dead of night is suddenly turned into the luster of
   day--so on a sudden does God's Grace often dawn upon the darkness of
   sinful hearts. You have seen, perhaps, at times after showers of rain
   have fallen upon the earth, how land which seemed all dry and barren
   was suddenly covered with green grass, with here and there a lily full
   in bloom. And so a heart which has been like a desert, when once the
   shower of Jesus' Grace falls on it, blossoms like the garden of the
   Lord and yields sweet perfume.

   And that in a moment! You who have given yourselves up in despair--you
   who have written your own condemnation! You who have made a league with
   death and a covenant with Hell and said, "There is no hope, therefore
   will we go after our iniquities," I charge you, hear me, when I declare
   that my Lord and Master, who has broken my chains and set me free, can
   break yours, too--and that with one blow! Mark, that if this is done,
   it is done forever. When Christ sets free, no chains can bind again.
   Let the Master say to me, "Captive, I have delivered you," and it is
   done!

   Come on, come on, you Fiends of the Pit! Mightier is He who is for us
   than all they who are against us. Come on, come on, temptations of the
   world--but if the Lord is on our side, whom shall we fear? If He is our
   defense, who shall be our destruction? Come on, come on, you foul
   corruptions, come on you machinations and temptations of my own
   deceitful heart--but He who has begun the good work in me will carry it
   on and perfect it to the end.

   Gather, gather, gather all your hosts together, you who are the foes of
   God and the enemies of man, and come at once with concentrated fury and
   with hellish might against my spirit--but if God acquits--who is he
   that condemns? Who shall separate us from the love of God which is in
   Christ Jesus our Lord? The black stream of death shall never wash out
   the mark of Christian liberty! That skeleton monarch bears no yoke
   which he can put upon a Believer's neck. We will shout victory when we
   are breast-deep amidst the last billows and grapple with the king upon
   the pale horse--we will throw the rider and win the victory in the last
   struggle, according as it is written, "Thanks be unto God which gives
   us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."

   Sparta and Greece refused to wear the yoke of Persia and broke the
   proud king's pomp. But we are free in a nobler sense! We refuse the
   yoke of Satan and will overcome his power as Christ overcame it in the
   days gone by. Let those who will, bend and crouch at the foot of the
   world's monarch! But as for those whom God has made free, they claim to
   think, to believe, to act, and to be as their Divine instinct commands
   them and the Spirit of God enables them--"Where the Spirit of the Lord
   is, there is liberty." "If the Son therefore shall make you free, you
   shall be free, indeed."

   IV. And now we put round the QUESTION, are we free, then, this morning?
   Are we free? I will not answer it for you, nor need I just now answer
   for myself, but I would beseech you to make a searching enquiry into
   it. If you are free, then remember that you have changed your lodging
   place, for the slave and the son sleep not in the same room of the
   house. The things which satisfied you when a slave will not satisfy you
   NOW.

   You wear a garment which a slave may never wear and you feel an
   instinct within which the slave can never feel. There is an Abba,
   Father, cry in you which was not there once. Is it so? Is it so? If you
   are free you lie not as you used to do. You go not to the slave's
   work--you have not now to toil and sweat to earn the wages of sin which
   is death. But now, as a son serves his father, you do a son's work and
   you expect to receive a son's reward--for the gift of God is eternal
   life through Jesus Christ our Lord!

   One thing I know, if you are free then you are thinking about setting
   others free. And if you have no zeal for the emancipation of other men
   you are a slave yourself. If you are free you hate all sorts of chains,
   all sorts of sin and you will never willingly put on the fetters again.
   You live each day crying unto Him who made you free at first, to hold
   you up that you fall not into the snare. If you are free, this is not
   the world for you! This is the land of slaves. This is the world of
   bondage. If you are free, your heart has gone to Heaven, the land of
   the free. If you are free today, your spirit is longing for the time
   when you shall see the great Liberator face to face!

   If you are free, you will bide your time until He calls you. But when
   He says, "Friend, come up here," you will fearlessly mount to the upper
   spheres--and death and sin shall be no hindrance to your advent to His
   Glory! I would we were all free! But if we are not, the next best thing
   I would is that those of us who are not free would fret under the
   fet-ter--for when the fetters are felt, they shall be broken! When the
   iron enters into the soul it shall be snapped. When you long for
   liberty you shall have it! When you seek for it as for hidden treasure
   and pant for it as the stag for the water brook, God will not deny you!
   "Seek and you shall find. Knock and it shall be opened. Ask and it
   shall be given you."

   God lead you to seek and knock and ask now, for Christ's sake. Amen.

                           General And Yet Particular

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, APRIL 24, 1864, BY THE REV. C, H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "You have given Him power o ver all flesh, that He should give eternal
   life to as many as You have given Him." John 17:2.

   THIS was used by our Savior as an argument why the Father should
   glorify Him in His dread hour of conflict. Our Lord did as much as say,
   "You have already given Me what I now ask. Therefore, since You have
   virtually bestowed it upon me in the Covenant, give it Me now in very
   deed." So the Believer, when he prays, asks for what is already his
   own. And when we come before the Lord in prayer this should encourage
   us much, that our heavenly Father has already given us all things in
   giving us His Son, so that we ask for what is virtually our own.

   The text itself we will try to open up briefly. It contains two
   statements--first, that Christ, as a Mediator, has received from God
   universal authority over all flesh. And secondly, that the object of
   this is special and peculiar, that He may give eternal life to as many
   as the Father has given to Him. You have universal power, but you have
   within it a special purpose. We know that our Lord Jesus Christ has all
   power given to Him in Heaven and in earth--"Angels and men before Him
   fall and devils fear and fly." All things, whether animate or
   inanimate, confess the majesty of Him who is King of kings and Lord of
   lords.

   Our text, however, mentions the most stubborn thing in all the
   world--"flesh." Jesus has power over all flesh. That willful, wicked,
   disobedient thing called flesh Christ knows how to govern. He has power
   over all men as fallen men, for such the term, flesh, describes. I
   understand, then, that Christ has power over all men, to pardon all
   whom He wills. Christ has this day as Mediator, power to convict of sin
   every living soul by His Spirit, if so He wills. And power to bring all
   men to the footstool of His Grace and to give them pardon if so it
   seems good in His sight. We do not believe that there is any exception
   to this rule--Christ has power over every man born of Adam, to give to
   him the Grace of conviction and the Grace of pardon, if so it should
   please Him to do.

   He has power also to make those who are not convicted of sin and who
   are not pardoned, subservient to His purpose. He has power to restrain
   their evil passions from running to an excess of riot. He can use them
   as His drudges to effect His purposes even when they proudly rebel
   against Him--so that though they boast themselves in their own free
   will--they shall really be working out His own eternal purpose. He has
   a bit often in the mouth of His fiercest enemy and a hook in the jaw of
   the bloodiest persecutor.

   Over all flesh He has authority whether it is crowned with royalty or
   wrapped in rags! Whether it curses with profanity or bows down with
   reverent adoration. There is not a mortal man from the equator to the
   poles, of any rank or any language, or bearing any hue upon his skin
   who is not subject to this universal mediatorial power of the Lord
   Jesus Christ. If I understand my text and Scriptures parallel with it,
   it was ordained in order to the salvation of the chosen, that the whole
   world of man should be taken from under the immediate rule of God as
   absolute God and placed under a new form of government of which the
   Mediator should be King and Head.

   As the result of this gracious arrangement a fallen race is permitted
   to exist--a sinful world coming into contact with an absolute God must
   have been instantaneously doomed to Hell. Man, while yet a rebel, lives
   on in virtue of the mediatorial power of Jesus! He has stepped in
   between avenging Justice and the sinner and so the sinner is spared. I
   trace to Christ's Atonement the continued life of the most obdurate.
   All the long-suffering mercy of God seems to me to flow through the
   channel of the Savior's authority over all flesh.

   It is in virtue of this power that the Gospel is preached to all
   men--"All power is given unto Me in Heaven and in earth. Go you,
   therefore, and teach all nations." Hence the command to believe
   receives its Divine sanction and those are condemned who believe not in
   His name. On account of this universal dispensation of mediatorship, an
   honest, gracious, and sincere invitation is given to whomever will, to
   drink of the Water of Life freely. It is, I say, on account of this
   universal mediatorial power of Christ that I can stand upon this
   platform and say in the broadest possible terms, that whoever believes
   on the Lord Jesus shall never perish, but have eternal life! And I can
   preach a Gospel which, in its proclamation, is as wide as the ruin and
   as extensive as the Fall.

   But why all this? The text tells us that the object and design of all
   this was not universal, but special--that the intention of God in thus
   putting all men under the power of Christ was not that all men might
   receive eternal life, but that He might give eternal life to as many as
   had been given to Him. So that in all this universal dealing there is
   the special and peculiar design that the chosen may receive life--that
   the elect may be filled with spiritual life on earth and afterwards
   enter into the Glory life above.

   God might doubtless have acted upon another plan and have given Christ
   power only over His elect if He had willed, that He might give eternal
   life to them. But it has not so pleased God. It has, on the contrary,
   pleased Him to put the whole race under the mediatorial sway of Jesus
   in order that He might give eternal life to those who were chosen out
   of the world. God might have commissioned His servants to go into the
   world and preach the Gospel to the chosen only-- He might have told us
   to present Christ only to certain persons upon whom there should be a
   peculiar mark. It has not so pleased Him.

   He bids us go "into all the world and preach the Gospel to every
   creature." His high decree and Divine intent being that those whom He
   has ordained unto eternal life shall, through believing, enter into the
   life which He has ordained for them. I do not know whether I have
   brought before you what I am certain is the full idea of the text--a
   general power given to the Mediator over all flesh--as the result of
   which a proclamation of mercy is universally published to men and a
   general declaration of salvation through faith presented to all
   creatures. But this always with a special, limited, definite
   design--that a chosen people--separated from before all worlds from the
   rest of mankind should obtain eternal life.

   I have aimed in my ministry constantly to preach, as far as I can, the
   whole of the Gospel rather than a fragment of it. Therefore those
   Brethren who are sounder than the Bible abhor me as much as if I were
   an Arminian. And on the other side, the enemies of the Doctrines of
   Grace often represent me as an Ultra-Calvinist. I am rejoiced to
   receive the censure of both sides! I am not ambitious to be numbered in
   the roll of either party. I have never cultivated the acquaintance nor
   desired the approbation of those men who shut their eyes to Truths of
   God which they do not wish to see.

   I never desired to be reputed so excessively Calvinistic as to neglect
   one part of Scripture in order to maintain another. If I am thought to
   be inconsistent with myself, I am very glad to be so, so long as I am
   not inconsistent with Holy Scripture. Sure I am that all the Truth of
   God is really consistent, but equally certain am I that it is not
   apparently so to our poor, finite minds. In nine cases out of ten he
   who is nervously anxious to be manifestly consistent with himself in
   his theological system, if he gains his end, is merely consistent with
   a fool!

   He who is consistent with Scripture is consistent with perfect Wisdom.
   He who is consistent with himself is at best consistent with
   imperfection, folly and insignificance. To keep to Scripture, even
   though it should involve a charge of personal inconsistency, is to be
   faithful to God and men's souls. My text seems to me to present that
   double aspect which so many people either cannot or will not see.

   Here is the great Atonement by which the Mediator has the whole world
   put under His dominion. But still here is a special object for this
   Atonement--the ingathering, or rather out-gathering--of a chosen and
   peculiar people unto eternal life.

   I. Let us, this morning, meditate upon the principle of the text and
   our first remark shall be that THE DOCTRINE OF A GENERAL DISPLAY OF
   POWER FOR THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF A SPECIAL OBJECT IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH
   THE ANALOGY OF NATURE. In the world around us we shall find the Creator
   accomplishing special purposes by a far wider display of power than the
   immediate object appears to require. Take, for instance, yonder plant.
   What is the main object for which a plant lives? Every botanist and
   every common observer will tell you that its object in living is that
   it may produce seed and perpetuate its like.

   God's object, then, in yonder plant is to produce a seed from it that
   its species may be perpetuated. How will He do it? Will He send an
   angel to watch over the seed and the seed alone? No, my Brethren, there
   shall be a watchful care over root, stem, cells, tissues, leaves and
   flowers. Although when winter comes, every leaf will drop off and rot
   in the ground and never be heard of again, yet those leaves have been
   the object of a superintending care, most marvelous and wise. Though
   the real object of it all has been the seed alone, yet stem and leaf
   and cell have all been watched over.

   Just so, I think, it is in God's dealings with His elect. He is looking
   to them as to the seed and substance of mankind, but those graceless
   ones who will perish forever like fading leaves have been the object of
   His tender care. If you tell me that the leaves were not absolutely
   necessary to the seed, I will give you another illustration still more
   clear. You are not to think that when God is about to accomplish a
   purpose He studies just how much will do it and then spends no more
   power than a pinching economy finds needful.

   We are wanting rain. Our gardens and fields are crying out for showers.
   Well, our gracious God will send it to us very soon. But will He just
   allot a shower to that piece of ground which requires it--will He not
   rather send a wide range of rain? I have sometimes wondered at this,
   that when the shower falls it must be God's intention to bless the
   field and yet He scatters the liquid blessing upon the salt and briny
   sea where no plants can be nourished and where it seems to be a waste
   to pour the cooling drops. You shall find it rain quite as heavily upon
   the Atlantic as upon the thirsty earth which is opening its mouth for
   the moisture.

   Why is this? Because it is the rule of God when He is accomplishing a
   purpose to deal after a general fashion though still the object is
   specific. Here is this air about us. Why is it made up of oxygen,
   hydrogen and nitrogen and so on? Is it not that plants and animals may
   live upon it? Surely this is the Creator's drift in making such a
   compound. But suppose you transfer yourself in imagination to the polar
   regions where life cannot exist, or to spots in the great desert of
   Sahara where even the vulture with swift wing has never flown. You will
   find the air composed of precisely the same particles!

   Why is this? There is no animal to breathe it, no plant to bloom in it.
   Why then the same? Simply because God is not like finite man--He has
   not to stint Himself to such an expenditure as shall just accomplish
   His own purpose--He acts like a God and in the infinity of His Nature
   He gives more than is absolutely necessary for the accomplishment of
   His purpose. Think again, now, of nature in another aspect. We are
   proud enough to think that God made this world for the comfort of man
   and with an eye to human convenience. Suppose we grant that principle
   for a moment.

   Here is a violet peeping out among the green leaves. Why has it that
   delicious perfume making glad the spring? Why, you tell me it is to
   gratify man. Very likely, very likely. But here are millions upon
   millions of violets which are never smelt by anybody which grow among
   the nettles at the back of the Church, or away in the woods where not
   even a child has wandered, or at a distance from the abodes of men
   where they are never seen or heard of, for--

   "Full many a flower is doomed to blush unseen, And waste its fragrance
   on the desert air." Why is everything so painted by the sun? Why do
   crystals sparkle when the sunbeams fall upon them? How is it you see
   the many lines of a rainbow when the sun is shining on a crystal?

   Why it must be to gratify the eye. God would have this world a place of
   beauty and a joy forever! But crystals sparkle in the polar regions
   where there is not even a bear to look upon them! In that inhospitable
   region where life goes out and where we believe no creature having life
   could possibly exist, the sun still shines and still the crystal
   flashes back to Him the colors of the iris. Why is this? Why is this? I
   cannot tell you, except that I perceive that God gives to the sun a
   power over all things that He may give pleasure to the eye.

   What multitudes of landscapes were never gazed upon by the artist's
   eye, yet there they are, sleeping in their beauty beneath the eyes of
   God. How the birds are singing this morning, how they are pouring forth
   from their throats sweet melodious strains and yet they are singing
   quite as well in the deep forest glade where no man can ever hear them
   as in our gardens and walks. Why is this? Do we not think that the
   birds sing for our joy and that the landscape is spread out for man's
   mental delight?

   It certainly is so, and yet there are landscapes and birds where there
   are no men to see and ears to hear. So I think I might continue all the
   morning giving you analogies from Nature in which God, in the
   accomplishment of a specific purpose adopts a general mode of action.

   II. I will take another view of the question. THIS PRINCIPLE IS SEEN IN
   PROVIDENCE. All of you believe in a general Providence. You believe
   that God superintends all the affairs of the universe so that there is
   not a grain of dust blowing in the street today which has not its orbit
   ordained and fixed as much as the planets in the sky. You believe that

   God overrules the motions of the rush that waves by the river as much
   as he does the policy of kings and emperors. Do not you believe in a
   special Providence, too?

   I do, and I believe you do. You believe that God is watching specially
   over His own people and that all things work together for good to them
   who love God, to them who are called according to His purpose. And did
   it ever strike you that there was any inconsistency in believing in a
   general and a special Providence? I do not suppose it ever did--I know
   it never did me. I know I feel quite easy in believing the two things
   and I should have been very uneasy in not being able to believe both. I
   do not see why the Christian may not transfer the idea and believe that
   there is a general influence for good flowing from the mediatorial
   sacrifice of Christ and yet its special design and definite object is
   the giving of eternal life to as many as the Father gave Him.

   We will take one or two instances in Providence. There is Jonah going
   to Tarshish. He has betrayed his Master and has fled from Nineveh. The
   Lord will have him back. He intends to bring him back in a strange
   conveyance--He has prepared a great fish to swallow him! How is Jonah
   to be got out of the ship? The storm must come and when the storm comes
   what does it do? Does it shake Jonah? Does it expose Jonah's life to
   danger? It does, but it also shakes the whole ship and all who are in
   the ship are afraid that they shall suffer shipwreck. And what is more,
   if there were a thousand ships upon the sea that day they felt the
   storm and yet God's special object was to have Jonah thrown into the
   sea-- though all the ships upon the sea must be tossed with the
   tempest, still there is the special design.

   Take another thing. It is ordained according to prophecy that Christ
   must be born at Bethlehem. Then Mary His mother, who is great with
   child, must be brought to Bethlehem. How shall it be done? Why, in
   order to fetch Joseph and Mary to Bethlehem, every man and woman in
   Judea must go to the place of their pedigree and still, though God's
   express design is to bring Mary there that Jesus may be born, He uses a
   general method in order to accomplish it and every other Jewish man and
   woman must go to the place of their pedigree!

   Here, again, is a particular object accomplished by general means. I
   might continue with many, many other instances, but indeed, you have
   only to open your eyes and see. My Brethren, if you pray tomorrow for
   God to send a favorable wind to waft the missionary-ship to its haven,
   the same wind will waft a merchantman, or a pirate, too, if they are
   going the same way. It may be that you pray that rain may come to
   extinguish a fire, and perhaps a shower comes, but you do not expect it
   to fall just where the fire is, but also for miles around. If you know
   some poor man living in Lancashire and you pray for him, that God would
   deliver him from poverty--if your prayer is heard, it may very likely
   be by quickening the trade of the whole country and conferring a
   blessing on the people of the whole neighborhood!

   In fact, you know yourselves if you are praying to God to bless your
   children, it is not possible that your children should be blessed
   without the blessing coming down upon others, because God's blessing
   any one man is the means indirectly of blessing other people. You
   cannot have a godly family down a court without the whole court being
   the better for it. You cannot have one Christian man favored by his God
   without his household having some portion of the favor. God sends the
   favor only to His servants--that is the special intention--but still
   there comes with that a wider blessing.

   While thinking over this matter I could only compare it to the moon
   when surrounded with a halo. The interior ring was the moon's own self,
   but round about it was a halo of brightness. Such is God's dealing with
   His people. There is the central substance of eternal, immutable
   love--but round about it there is a Divine halo--it encompasses all the
   creatures of God and makes them, in some measure, to participate in the
   light of the great central love, which belongs peculiarly to His
   saints.

   III. Let us for one moment show that this has been ILLUSTRATED BY
   MIRACLES. Joshua is fighting with the Ca-naanites. There has been a
   long battle, but he desires to see his enemy exterminated and boldly
   turning round he cries to the sun, "Stand still upon Gibeon. And you,
   moon, in the valley of Ajalon." What did the sun and moon stand still
   for? Why to help Joshua against the Canaanites! But do you not think
   all the people everywhere had a longer day as the result? Did not every
   man who looked up wonder how it was that the sun stood still? There was
   a poor man with a hard task and he was afraid he should not finish it
   before the sun went down. How glad was he to find an extra hour added
   to the day!

   He knew nothing about the special purpose and yet there was a special
   purpose in it all. Every man and woman on that side of the hemisphere
   enjoyed a length of light unusual for that time and yet there was no
   design of blessing them in Joshua's prayer. They were blessed
   incidentally. The real object was that the children of Israel might
   fight the battle and complete it. Take another miracle--Sennacherib has
   come against Jerusalem--he is about to swallow up Hezekiah and all the
   little kingdom of Judah. Hezekiah takes Rabshakeh's letter and lays it
   before the Lord. As the result of this, the angel of the Lord went
   through the camp of Sennacherib and slew his mighty men and the power
   of Assyria was broken.

   What was the effect of it? There was the little straggling kingdom of
   Babylon, then contending for existence with Assyria. That kingdom was
   spared and became afterwards the destroyer of Assyria. And you read
   that Berodachbaladan, the king, sent messengers to Hezekiah to thank
   him for what was done. You see Babylon gets good out of the destruction
   of Sennacherib, but was this the main design? Certainly not. The grand
   object of God in destroying Sennacherib was to deliver Hezekiah and His
   people and yet the whole earth rejoices and has rest when the great
   hammer of the Lord falls on Assyria and its empire is broken and
   destroyed. It was a blessing to all the East when the power of the
   despot was broken that night--but the object of it was for Israel and
   for Israel, alone.

   Come to the days of Christ and observe another miracle--there is a ship
   tossed within the tempest. Her mast is ready to go over the side. Her
   timbers crack--she will be swamped and go down. No, she will not--for
   there sleeps with His head upon the helm, the Master of the tempest,
   the Lord High Admiral of the sea, King Jesus! And when He has been
   awakened He stands up and rebukes the winds and waves and instantly
   there is a great calm. Why did He make the calm? For the preservation
   of His disciples and His own ship. But did the calm end there and give
   no blessing to others? We are informed that there were with Him many
   other little ships and so they all enjoyed the calm, too. The direct
   and definite intention was to make His disciples at peace and in
   safety. But the effect of it did not end with the disciples, but every
   ship which was out upon the sea of Nazareth that night enjoyed the
   calm.

   One more instance and I will not multiply them, lest I fatigue you.
   Paul and Silas are in prison--God's object is to terrify the jailer and
   to bring out of prison His two servants, Paul and Silas. What does it
   say?--"The foundations of the prison were shaken and Paul and Silas had
   their bands loosed"? No, Brethren. "And every man's bands were loosed."
   Was it God's object to bring every man out of prison? No one dreams of
   such a thing! This was merely a concurrent benefit which went with
   God's special object in dealing with His poor persecuted followers,
   Paul and Silas.

   So I believe that as it was in these miracles, so it is in that grander
   miracle, the great work of Grace. Jesus Christ comes into the world as
   a Propitiation for our sins and not for ours only, but for the sins of
   the whole world. And yet it is true He loved His Church and gave
   Himself for it. He laid down His life for His sheep and for His people
   did He die and not for the world, in one sense, and yet in that other
   sense which I have tried to bring out, He was a Propitiation for the
   sins of the whole world.

   IV. Let us now LOOK AT FACTS. How do we really find the Gospel operate?
   I think I see this island of Great Britain covered with forests with
   men living in them having their naked bodies painted, dwelling in
   caves, feeding upon herbs and acorns. I think I see a simple-minded
   man--some think it was Paul--landing upon the shore and coming forward,
   trying to teach these savages the way of salvation. Oh, what a prolific
   hour was that when first the Gospel was preached in Britain! What has
   been the effect of it?

   Brethren, let us answer another question first--What was the immediate
   design of God in sending the Gospel to Great Britain? My answer is to
   save as many as He had ordained to eternal life. That was His great
   object. But what has been the effect of it? I trace the liberty, the
   happiness and the prosperity of our country throughout these many
   centuries, to the prevalence of the Gospel in it. And though I believe
   God's design in sending the Gospel--I mean the central design--was that
   He might separate unto Himself His own chosen people, yet in connection
   with the Gospel, innumerable and incalculable blessings have come to
   every Englishman.

   And there does not live a man who claims the name of Briton who is not
   under solemn obligation to the preaching of the Gospel for ten thousand
   benefits. Christ has, indeed, in England, seemed to have power over all
   Englishmen, that He might give eternal life to as many as the Father
   gave Him. Look at the Reformation. What was God's object in raising up
   Luther and Calvin and Zwingle to work the Reformation? Why, for this
   grand purpose--that Christ might see of the travail of His soul and
   that His chosen might believe in Him. That was the purpose of the
   Reformation! But what did the Reformation accomplish?

   Not only this, but a thousand things besides, for it was to the
   Reformation that arts and sciences owed their progress. The human mind
   was liberated and expanded. And millions of people who never obtained
   eternal life through Jesus Christ, nevertheless, through the glorious
   Reformation obtained their liberty and ten thousand other mercies
   beyond all price. This is a matter of fact. And if you take the Gospel
   to the South Seas, if you preach it to the benighted people there, you
   will find that it will subdue all flesh to its Divine power. But still
   the object is kept in view--that as many as God gave to Christ might
   have eternal life.

   Let us observe one self-evident truth. It is a remarkable fact that
   where the Gospel is not preached in its general aspect, God does not
   seem to work out His special object to any large extent. I mean to say
   that if you will go into any Chapel in London and you find a minister
   there who preaches nothing whatever of the Word of God, except that one
   part of it which is most blessedly and sweetly true--God's electing
   love--if you will listen to that man and hear him preach from the first
   of January to the end of December upon that one topic--the specialty
   and peculiarity of Divine Grace--you need not go into the vestry to ask
   the deacons if they have many conversions.

   I am certain you will find there are few, indeed, and those mostly
   among persons who were convicted of sin and aroused elsewhere, and who
   obtain liberty under the gracious doctrine. But the absolute conversion
   of many is not a thing to be expected, and certainly not a thing found
   where the preacher is so restrained by his sense of electing love as to
   be unable to boldly preach the rest of the Gospel and say, "Believe in
   the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved." You have only to try it,
   dear Friends--put your feet into the Chinese shoes and prevent their
   growing to the proper size, in order to keep them in ecclesiastical
   comeliness--and you will soon find your walk of usefulness very much
   restricted.

   Hold on to the point of being consistent! Make that the main
   thing--banish those texts which speak about anything general--never
   open your mouth with a universal invitation! Make it out that the Bible
   has not a word in it directed to men as men, but only to the chosen and
   I will undertake that unless there is an unprecedented act of God's
   Sovereignty, you shall preach from one end of the year to the other and
   you shall not be troubled at the number of the elect people. There will
   be very few who will ever come forward.

   But I know also, (and he who will look candidly will see it), that the
   most effective ministry is that one which is not ashamed of the
   Doctrines of Grace! The ministry which does not stutter or stammer in
   talking about election! Does not trim or cut the Divine Sovereignty of
   God, but which is equally clear upon the other point that God has
   declared His own solemn oath, "I will not the death of a sinner, but
   had rather that he should turn unto Me and live." A ministry which
   holds Sovereignty but holds man's responsibility, too, which dares to
   talk about God's special object with bold voice and yet insists upon it
   that He has proclaimed to every creature under Heaven this gracious
   proclamation, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be
   saved."

   Well, now, these are facts and facts which are not to be disputed,
   either. We hear people sometimes sneer and say, "Ah, there are many
   conversions, but are they genuine?" Sir, they are genuine! For we will
   boast this much that if there are not genuine conversions found in this
   Church, for instance, there are no conversions genuine under Heaven.
   For when I see harlots made chaste and remaining honorable women year
   after year. When I know drunkards who forswear the cup and who labor
   with their might for the reclaiming of others. When I look upon those
   who were once singing the song of the lascivious on the ale-bench who
   now for years--mark you, not months--for years persevere in holiness, I
   make this my glory!

   If any can find better conversions under Heaven let them find them! I
   am satisfied that they are such converts as Apostolic times added to
   the Church--such as honor God in their lives and glorify Christ daily
   by their walk and conversation. I believe you shall find most
   conversions where neither Truth of God is held back, but where, as in
   the text, the two are taught. "You have given Him power over all flesh,
   that He should give eternal life to as many as You have given Him."

   V. OUR PRINCIPLE EXPLAINS MANY SCRIPTURES and this goes very much in
   its favor. I like to read my Bible so as never to have to blink when I
   approach a text. I like to have a theology which enables me to read it
   right through from beginning to end and to say, "I am as pleased with
   that text as I am with the other." You know, Brothers and Sisters, you
   must be conscious of it, that there are many texts of Scripture which
   look wonderfully like universal redemption. Wonderfully like it and if
   they do not intend some sort of generality, they certainly speak in a
   very singular manner.

   Such a text as this, "He is the Propitiation for our sins: and not for
   ours only, but for the sins of the whole world." "Who gave Himself a
   ransom for all to be testified in due time." I might mention more of
   these--but if you get with an Arminian brother he will have them all at
   his fingertips, so you will spare me the trouble. These people are
   always dwell- ing upon these, and think they have quite upset the
   doctrine of particular redemption though that is as plain in Scripture
   as the nose upon a man's face! We know Scripture says, "He has laid
   down His life for the sheep." He has redeemed us from among men.
   "Christ loved the Church and gave Himself for it." And you know that
   passage--"Husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the Church
   and gave Himself for it."

   How did He love the Church? He loved the Church with a special love,
   far above that which He gives to others, or else according to that
   metaphor a husband ought to love his wife, and love every other woman
   just as much! That is the natural inference of that text. But you
   clearly see there must have been a special love intended in the husband
   towards the wife and so there must be a special love in Christ. He
   loved the Church and gave Himself for it.

   Now do you not think, Brethren, as there are two sets of texts in the
   Bible, the one of which very clearly speaks about the infinite value of
   the Atonement and another which very evidently speaks about the
   intention of that Atonement being for the chosen and for the chosen
   only, that the best way is to believe them both and to say, "Yes, I see
   it--as the result of Christ's death all men are put under the system of
   mediatorial Grace, so that Christ has power over them. But the object
   of His doing this is not that He may save all of them, but that He may
   save out of these all which He now has in His own hands--those whom the
   Father has given Him"?

   The shepherd trusts me with all his sheep in order that I may sever
   from them twenty which he has marked. A father tells me to go into the
   midst of his family, his whole family, in order that I may take out of
   it one of his sons to be educated. So God gives to Christ all flesh,
   says the text, but still always with this definite and distinct
   purpose--that He may give eternal life to those whom He has given to
   Him.

   VI. Let us go on in the sixth place to say briefly that this seems
   quite CONSISTENT WITH THE NATURE OF

   GOD. We too often measure God after a human standard and therefore make
   mistakes. Remember that God has such an abundance of mercy and Grace
   and power, that He never has to calculate how much will be necessary
   for the accomplishment of His purpose. He does largely and literally
   like one who cannot but act in an infinitely gracious manner. If you
   have some chickens and you wish to feed them, you will only throw down
   as much barley as the fowls will want, but you do not think of feeding
   all the sparrows of the neighborhood!

   It would be a very good thing if you could for they all need food. But
   you throw down as much as will accomplish your purpose. Now our God
   never has to stint Himself in this way, but with large handfuls He
   feeds the special objects of His care and the ravens and kites besides.
   God, again, exhibits a kingly character in His great methods of general
   love. At the coronation of the old kings, the fountains in Cheapside
   ran with red wine. Now you will say, "What a waste!" The gutters ran
   down on both sides with wine. It was not necessary, was it? The king's
   object was that his subjects might have wine.

   Well, if that were his only object that might have been accomplished by
   opening the bottles one by one and stopping when there was just enough
   to satisfy their thirst. Why did it run down the streets? Was it a
   waste? Not at all, it exhibited the royal glory. The king was glad to
   give the people wine to drink, but he wanted also to show himself a
   king and as nobody but a king could make gutters run with wine,
   therefore he did it to illustrate his own magnificence. And our God,
   when He is about to exhibit mercy, does not say, "So much will just
   accomplish My purpose and save My elect"-- that is His main object. But
   behold, He makes the rivers run with wine and the floods with milk, so
   there is enough and to spare and yet no waste, because His grander
   object is His own Glory, and He is glorified even by that love which
   does not effectually save.

   When Napoleon was at war, his favorite tactics were, we are told,
   always to bring crushing battalions to bear upon some one point to
   carry everything before him. That, my dear Friends, is the mode of
   procedure in which you and I have to act. If we have to accomplish a
   purpose, we must concentrate the whole of our might upon that one
   point. But suppose one greater than Napoleon, or a Napoleon with ten
   times ten thousand times more troops than he had? He would not need to
   concentrate his battalions upon one point, but simply cry to all his
   hosts, "Advance!" and they would go crushing down his foes at every
   point of the line.

   So our God cares for the salvation of His elect. But that is not the
   only thing He cares about--His own Glory is higher than this. His Glory
   is the whole of the line and our God, while He effectually saves those
   whom He has chosen, has no need to bring all His power upon one point.
   He has abundance to spare after He has done all that we know of. He
   can, while He is blessing His people, also bless the entire universe
   according to His own will. And I doubt not that so He does and that
   Heaven and earth are full of the majesty of His Glory, because Heaven
   and earth, though they may not alike participate in the fullness of
   Divine complacency, are full of the beams of His love.

   VII. I have to conclude by saying that this principle is a MODEL FOR
   OUR CONDUCT. I was talking the other day with a Brother. He said he did
   not think the conversion of the world was the legitimate object of
   missionary enterprise, because all that Christ intended by the Gospel
   was the gathering out of a people. Well now, it seems to me that my
   dear friend was quite right and quite wrong. As to God's purpose in the
   sending of the Gospel to the world he was quite right, it is the
   gathering out of a people.

   But as to my work he was quite wrong, for the work of God's minister is
   not the gathering out of a people. Christ surely knows what His own
   disciple is to do. Just hear. "Go you and teach all nations, baptizing
   them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."
   That is our work. He did not say, "Go you and sever out of all nations
   a people to be taught and to be baptized." No! Christ's marching orders
   to His people are in these words, "Preach the Gospel to every
   creature." What will be the result of this universal proclamation?

   The chosen will be saved. Then, Lord, why not send me to Your chosen?
   Why send me to all nations? "What business have you to question your
   Master's will? Is not this the very way in which I have chosen, that My
   elect shall be brought, by the preaching of the Gospel to all nations?"
   I look as the result of missionary enterprise, not for the world's
   conversion--I do not expect it--I believe that God will gather out of
   all people His chosen, and that Christ will come and when He comes,
   then shall He reign from the river even to the ends of the earth. But
   all the missionary societies put together will never convert the world,
   nor do I believe they will do very much towards it unless they very
   soon alter their tactics.

   We shall have to try something very different from all the societies
   which have ever been in operation before we see any great results. I am
   waiting for a good time to come. Till then we must use old vessels till
   we get better ones, but better ones will be found. My own impression is
   that the world will never be converted by missionary agencies, but that
   is not your business--I am not to make God's decrees the rule of my
   walk. I am to make God's revealed will my rule of action. Christ tells
   me to, "Preach the Gospel to every creature," and if I were absolutely
   certain there was not one elect man upon earth, I would obey and preach
   the Gospel for all that--because if there were not a single soul saved
   by it, we are unto God a sweet-smelling savor.

   So then, I say to you individually, talk about Christ
   everywhere--preach Jesus Christ to every creature. Say to every man and
   woman you meet, "There is life in a look at the Crucified One." Tell
   men that, "Whoever comes unto Him, He will in no wise cast out," and
   let this be always your comfort, that all that the Father gives to Him
   shall come to Him! That Jesus shall see His seed. That of all that the
   Father has given Him He will lose none, but will present them all at
   His right hand at last. Fly back to God's electing love and the decrees
   of God as the pillow of your rest.

   But take the general command and the universal power of Christ over all
   flesh as the sword with which you fight and the staff upon which you
   lean. It is for this end that I ask you, dear Friends, to contribute as
   you shall see fit, to the spreading of the Gospel in foreign lands by
   the Missionary Society. I do not believe it is a perfect
   organization--I believe it is full of faults. I believe, however, it is
   the only way in which we can send the Gospel to the heathen just now.

   We will have a better plan by-and-by, I hope, but meanwhile--as this is
   the only one--let us use it with vigor, for, after all, it is not the
   instrumentality, but God. And if I have to look upon this as an
   ox-goad--an unfit tool to strike the Philistines, yet as I have not a
   better I will use it till a better shall be found! Meanwhile let us
   pray the Lord to speed His own cause and gather out His chosen by His
   Grace. Amen.

                                 Labor In Vain

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, MAY 1, 1864, BY THE REV. C. H. SPURGEON,
   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Jonah said unto them, Take me up and cast me forth into the sea; so
   shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great
   tempest is upon you. Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the
   land. But they could not: for the sea worked and was tempestuous
   against them." Jonah 1:12,13.

   THESE mariners manifested most commendable humanity. They were not
   willing, even though it were to preserve their own lives, to cast
   overboard an innocent man. Therefore they first used their best
   endeavors. And when these failed they made a solemn appeal to God,
   entreating Him not to lay upon them innocent blood--and then, since
   necessity has no law, Jonah, as a last resource was given up to the
   boisterous element, but not till every effort had been made to save
   him. We should he very careful of human life, doing nothing which even
   indirectly may destroy or injure it.

   And if we should be jealous over life, how much more anxious should we
   be concerning men's souls! And how watchful lest we should do anything
   by which the least of the human family may have his eternal interests
   endangered by our example or teaching! God give us Divine Grace, like
   these mariners, to row hard that if possible we may bring the ship to
   land laboring that none around us may be left to perish.

   I shall not, however, dwell upon that aspect of the text. Our Savior
   selected Jonah as one of His peculiar types-- "There shall no sign be
   given," said He, "to the men of this generation but the sign of the
   Prophet Jonah." We believe, therefore, that we are not erring if we
   translate the details of the history of Jonah into spiritual
   illustrations of man's experience and action with regard to Christ and
   His Gospel.

   We have before us a picture of what most men do before they will resort
   to God's remedy. That remedy is here most fairly imaged in the
   deliverance of the whole ship's company by the sacrifice of one on
   their behalf.

   I. Our first observation is that SINNERS, WHEN THEY ARE TOSSED UPON THE
   SEA OF CONVICTION, MAKE DESPERATE EFFORTS TO SAVE THEMSELVES. The men
   rowed hard to bring the ship to land. The Hebrew is they "dug" hard,
   sending the oars deep into the water with much exertion and small
   success. The tempest so tossed the sea about that they could not row in
   a good and orderly manner. But they desperately tugged at the oars,
   which the towering waves rendered useless by too deep a digging.

   Straining every sinew they labored by violence to get the ship in
   safety to the haven. Brethren, no word in any language can express the
   violence of earnest action with which awakened sinners strive and
   struggle to obtain eternal life. Truly, if the kingdom of God were in
   the power of him that wills and him that runs, they would possess it at
   once! Since they struggle, however, in an unlawful manner, the crown of
   victory will never be awarded them. They may kindle the fire and
   rejoice in the sparks, but thus says the Lord, "This shall you have of
   My hand: you shall lie down in sorrow."

   Let us notice some forms of the fleshy energy of men straining after
   self-salvation. The most usual is moral reformation. We have seen the
   drunkard, when conscience has been awakened, renounce his cups
   altogether. He has gone further than temperance and has espoused total
   abstinence. And proceeding further still, it often happens that in the
   excess of zeal, he vomits forth furious words against all who go not
   the same length of abstinence as himself.

   Yonder man was given up to blasphemy, but now an ill word never comes
   from his tongue--and he is therefore content with himself because he no
   longer curses God. Another has followed an ill trade, or has been in
   the habit of neglecting Sunday worship. Conscience has mercifully led
   him to give up his ill connections and attend a place of worship. Is
   not this well? It is, indeed, well. But it is not enough! It is
   marvelous how far men will push their reforms. And yet how little solid
   peace such purging can secure. For what is the sinner after his
   reformation but the blackamoor washed clean, a blackamoor still?

   I would have the Ethiopian clean by all manner of means. But I would
   not let him fancy that the soap and the niter will make him white. I
   would have the leopard tamed and caged, but this will not remove his
   spots. Moral reforms are excellent in themselves, but they are
   dangerous if we rest in them. Let even a corpse be washed, but let no
   man dream that the most careful washing will restore it to life. "You
   must be born again" rings out the death knell of all salvation by human
   effort. Unless reforms are founded in regeneration, they are baseless
   things which fail in the end for want of foundation. They are deceptive
   things, affording a transient hope, which soon, alas, must melt away.

   Ah, my Hearer, you may go on improving and reforming, but all your
   present and future amendments can never wipe out the old score of sin.
   There stands the black catalog of your sins, engraved as in eternal
   brass! The gloomy record remains unaltered and unalterable by any deeds
   of yours. Something more potent than your tears and change of life must
   take away the sins of your departed years. Beware, then, of thinking
   that you are getting the ship to land--no matter how hard you row with
   these oars of human resolution.

   Others add to their reformation a superstitious regard to the outwards
   of religion. According to the sect with which they unite, they become
   excessively religious. They reverence every nail of the Church door and
   every panel of the pulpit. There is not a brick in the aisle which is
   not sacred to them, nor even tile on the roof! Every rubric, every
   "Amen," every vestment and candlestick has to them a world of sanctity
   about it. They are not content with the ordinary days of worship, but
   the Church bell rings every morning. And well it may, for if men are to
   earn salvation in God's House, they had need be there all day and all
   night, too!

   Even in a Protestant Church, men row very hard with multitudinous
   observances and superstitious performances, but when you get into the
   Romish Church, the labor in vain comes to a climax! There are vows of
   poverty, celibacy, silence, passive obedience and a thousand other
   tortures! If the Moloch whom they worship is not satisfied he ought to
   be. We heard but the other day of a gentleman giving up all his goodly
   heritage, selling his broad acres and pouring all the purchase money
   into the coffers of the monks and priests in order that at last by
   rowing hard in this way he might get the ship to land.

   It is remarked of the Hindus that they give vastly more to their idols
   than we bestow upon the cause of God and I suppose it is true--but then
   they also are rowing hard to get the ship to land. All they do is for
   themselves. Self is always a mighty power in the world. Do but teach
   men that they can gain their own salvation by their own doings and
   mortifications and offerings and I would expect to see the treasury
   filled! I would expect to hear the whip constantly going upon the
   shoulders. But I should despair of seeing anything like holiness
   surviving in the land. Superstition is hard rowing but the ship will
   not come to the land by it. Men invent ceremony after ceremony. There
   is this pomp and that show--this gaudy ornament and that procession.
   But the whole matter ends in outward display, no secret soul-blessing
   results flow from there. Priests and their votaries may go on piling up
   human inventions ad infinitum, but they will forever fail to ease the
   conscience, or give rest to a disturbed soul. Man's awful necessities
   crave something more than the husks of superstition!

   You will find another form of the same thing among ourselves. Many
   persons row hard to get the ship to land by a notional belief in
   orthodox doctrine. This superstition is harder to deal with, but quite
   as dangerous as the belief in good works. It is quite as legal an idea
   for me to think to be accepted by believing good doctrine as to expect
   to be pardoned for doing good works. Yet we have scores of people who,
   if they can get hold of the Calvinistic creed at the right end--if they
   become masters of it and know how to argue against Arminianism--if they
   become not only sound Calvinists but a little sounder still, having not
   only the sixteen ounces to the pound but two or three ounces over and
   above, so as to make them ultra-Calvinistic--why then they fancy that
   all must be well!

   "I never can hear a preacher," this man will say, "who is not sound. I
   can tell at once when there is a grain of free will in the sermon."
   This is all very well, but he who boasts thus may be no better than the
   devil! No, he may not be so good, for the devil believes and
   trembles--but these men believe and are too much hardened in their own
   conceit to think of trembling. Away with the idea that believing sound
   doctrine and chaining ourselves to a cast-iron creed is vital godliness
   and eternal life! Orthodox sinners will find that Hell is hot and that
   their knowledge of predestination will not yield a cooling drop to
   their parched tongues.

   Condemning other people--cutting off the saints of God right and
   left--is but poor virtue and to have these blessed doctrines in the
   head while neglecting them in the heart is anything but a gracious
   sign. If you can "a hair divide between the west and north-west side,"
   do not therefore fancy that your fine gifts and profound orthodoxy will
   ensure you an entrance into the kingdom of Heaven. Ah, you may row with
   those oars, but you will not get the ship to land--you must be saved by
   Sovereign Grace through the operation of the Holy Spirit upon the
   heart--or you will not be saved at all. As it is not by doing that we
   are saved, neither is it by subscribing to creeds. There is something
   more than this needed before the ship can reach the port.

   Perhaps, in this congregation, we have other subtle methods of
   endeavoring to do the same thing. The pastor has noticed that many are
   resting upon their own incessant prayers. Ah, my poor Hearer, you know
   your need of something, you can hardly tell what. You have heard the
   subject of salvation explained to you a hundred times and now when it
   comes to the pinch you do not understand it after all. I thank God that
   you have learned how to pray--that your sighs and cries and groans come
   up before Him. But I sorrow because you trust in your prayers and rest
   in them. Remember that you will no more be saved for the sake of your
   prayers than for the sake of your good works.

   If your knees become hard as the knees of St. James are said to have
   been--hard like the camel's through long kneeling--and if with the
   Psalmist you could say, 'My throat is dried, my eyes fail," yet all
   this, if you look to it and do not look to Christ, will never avail
   you. I knew what it was for months to cry out to God and to find the
   heavens above me as brass, because I had not understood clearly the
   soul-quickening words, "Believe and live," but dreamed that by praying
   I could get myself into a suitable state to receive mercy, or perhaps
   move the heart of God towards me!

   Whereas that heart needed no moving towards me, it was full of love
   from before the foundation of the world. Pray, my dear Brethren. Let me
   never discourage you in that. But do let me beg you not to sit still,
   or recline upon your prayers, for if you get no further than your
   prayers, you will never get to Heaven. There is more wanted than crying
   to God! More wanted than earnest desires, however passionately they may
   be breathed. There must be faith in Jesus or else you will row hard
   with your prayers, and you will never bring the ship to land.

   Then there are others who are toiling by--I scarcely know how to
   describe it--a sort of mental torture. Oh, the many who say, "If I
   could feel as I ought to feel. O, Sir, my heart is as hard as a nether
   millstone. And yet I do not feel that it is hard--I wish I did. I would
   give my eyes if I could repent. I would give my right arm if I could
   but weep for sin! I would be satisfied to be a beggar, or to lie
   rotting in a dungeon if I could but feel that I was fit to come to the
   Savior! But, alas, I feel nothing! If I did but feel my unfitness--did
   but know my own unworthiness--I should have hope. But I am made of such
   Hell-hardened steel that neither terrors or mercies can move me. O,
   that I could repent! O, that this rock could give forth streams like
   that Rock which Moses smote in the wilderness of old! O, that I could
   but bring my heart to melt into something like desires after God and
   Christ! Oh, I am everything but what I should be!"

   Now, my dear Hearer, you will row very hard in this way before you will
   ever come to land, for self-righteousness lies at the bottom of all
   this. You want to save your heart from hardness and then come to Jesus,
   which is much as to say you wish to save yourself and then come to Him
   to put the finishing stroke upon you. You have a secret attachment to
   your own goodness or you would not be so eager to compass a
   fitness--you should at once do as you are bid and rest alone on Jesus.
   Your business is not with self, but with Jesus! With Jesus, just as you
   are. However hard your heart may be--however destitute of feeling you
   may have become--this, though it should be subject for lamentation,
   should never keep you from resting in Him who is able to save to the
   uttermost them that come unto God by Him.

   I tell you, your trying to get your heart into a right state, your
   trying to repent, your trying to be humble is all labor in vain. It is
   all going the wrong way to work. Your business is with Christ! He can
   soften, cleanse and sanctify, but you can do none of these, try as you
   will. Come as you are to my Lord Jesus, hard-heart and all, and the sea
   shall soon be calm for you. While you row with your own oars, the sea
   will only work and be the more tempestuous.

   Various are the shapes which this carnal energy assumes. I have met
   with many who are in this kind of case. They are constantly starting
   objections to their own salvation and trying to answer them. They have
   comfort for a moment and they say, "Yes, this is very sweet, but"--and
   then they will spend a week or two in trying to split up that but. When
   they are rid of this but, a mercy will come to them from another
   quarter and they are sure to meet it with, "Ah, blessed be God for
   that, but." They are always pulling away at these buts.

   These big waves come sweeping up to the side of their vessel and they
   try to dig their oars into them. Friend, if you are never saved until
   you, an unpardoned sinner, have answered all objections, you will never
   be saved because there are a thousand objections to the salvation of
   any man which can only be met by one argument and that is the blood of
   Jesus. If you will go here and there seeking answers to the devil's
   suggestions of unbelief you may travel the whole world and end your
   fruitless task in despair.

   But if you will come to Jesus, if you will see Him like another Jonah
   thrown out of the ship for your sake. If you will but see Him lost that
   you may be saved, then a peace which passes all understanding shall
   keep your heart and mind by Christ Jesus.

   II. We will now take the second point. Like these mariners, THE FLESHY
   EFFORTS OF AWAKENED SINNERS MUST INEVITABLY FAIL. The text says, "The
   men rowed hard to bring it to the land. But they could not." With all
   man's rowing after mercy and salvation, he can never find it by his own
   efforts. For this good reason, first of all, that it is contrary to
   God's Law for a sinner to get comfort by anything he can do for and by
   himself. Here is the law--"By the works of the Law there shall no flesh
   living be justified."

   That rule, then, fixed and fast as the laws of Nature, shuts out
   forever all hope of the attainment of joy and peace by anything that we
   can do, or be, or feel--for all these the Law already claims of us. How
   mad then will it be on our part if we run counter to a Divine Law!
   Success is impossible in so perverse a course. I do well, therefore, if
   I discourage all the efforts of awakened consciences to find peace
   anywhere except in the work of Christ. Let a man labor ever so
   earnestly, yet if he goes against the laws of Nature, you know his
   labor is lost.

   Here is an oven to be warmed for hungry persons need bread. See the
   workers yonder, how they toil, bringing snow with all their might to
   heat the oven. "Well," you say, "do not discourage them. Do not
   discourage their earnest activity. It is a pity when you see people
   really determined to do anything, to discourage their efforts." Ah, it
   is a pity, indeed, except when these efforts are foolish. If I see them
   bringing snow to heat an oven I know they will never do it, work as
   hard as they may.

   And when sinners bring their own works to yield them spiritual comfort,
   I know that they are spending their labor for that which profits not
   and I must and will discourage them! Some years ago certain persons
   engaged in a speculation to sink a coal mine in a part of England where
   coal was never found. Prospectuses were issued. Directors obtained. And
   shareholders duped! And the workmen began to sink their shaft. Now it
   was absolutely certain--any geologist could have told them so--that
   they would not find coal, let them dig to doomsday.

   Suppose you and I had gone there and seen them digging and had laughed
   at them, or told them it was all of no avail? Wiseacres might have
   replied, "You ought not to discourage coal mining, you ought not to
   discourage men who are working so very hard." I would say, "I would not
   discourage coal mining in any place where there is coal to be had. But
   for these poor souls to throw away their sweat and their money for that
   which is not coal--I will discourage them in that insane enterprise and
   think I do them good service."

   When we see men struggling after eternal life through their own
   efforts, we know eternal life is not to be had there. We are glad that
   they are awakened to anything like effort, for anything is better than
   spiritual sloth--but we are grieved to see them laboring in the very
   fire, toiling where success can never crown their endeavors. There is
   no salvation by the works of the Law--why then look for it there? If
   you dash your head against the law of Nature, the law of Nature will
   not change for you. And if you labor in opposition to the irreversible
   Law of God, you will pay the penalty of it in your utter failure.

   The ancients fabled that it was one of the tortures of Hell to which
   the daughters of Danaus were condemned, that they should fill a tub
   without a bottom with buckets full of holes. Behold the picture of the
   self-righteous man's undertaking! He may labor, he may toil, but he is
   filling a bottomless tub with leaky buckets. And work as he may, though
   he drop down dead in the attempt, success is impossible. O that he knew
   it to be so and would trust in the Lord Jesus! Besides this, the man
   cannot succeed in obtaining salvation by his own efforts because in
   what he is doing he is insulting God! He is casting dirt in the face of
   Christ! He is denying the whole testimony of the Holy Spirit.

   Ah, my Hearer, if you could save yourself, why was it necessary that
   Christ should die for you? If your prayers could avail, why did He
   sweat great drops of blood? Why, Man, if there were any merit in your
   mortification, or your reformation, what need that the Prince of Life
   and Glory should veil Himself in ignominy and suffer a death of shame?
   You do, in fact, say by your fleshly attempts, I want no Savior, I can
   save myself! You do, in fact, scoff at the great Atonement which God
   has made in the Person of Christ!

   This insult will ruin your soul, except you turn from it. Repent of it,
   I pray you. Humble yourself and receive Jesus' finished work. If
   scorning the Jordan, Naaman had gone to Abana and Pharpar, he might
   have washed not only seven times but seventy times seven! He might have
   earnestly persevered in the constant immersion, but he would have
   remained a leper to his dying day. If you scorn the Atonement and
   neglect God's great command to believe and live. If you go about to try
   and feel, or be, or do, you will use these Abanas and Pharpars to your
   own damnation! And to your own salvation never.

   I pray you, do not insult God by looking for balm in Gilead, or for a
   physician there. There is no balm in Gilead, there never was any. There
   is no physician there, or else the daughter of my people would long ago
   have been healed. Men would long ago have saved themselves. You must
   look higher than the Gilead of human energy. You must look higher than
   earth's physicians. You must look to the hills where comes our Help,
   the great mountains of a Savior's work and merit!

   There are many other reasons why it is impossible that a man can ever
   get comfort in the way of works and feelings. The principal one I will
   mention is because that is the way of the curse. He who is under the
   Law is under the curse. So long as I stick to the Law, do what I may, I
   am under the curse of the Law and consequently under the curse. And how
   can I expect in the way of the curse to find the eternal blessing? Oh,
   folly, to choose the way of the curse as the way of blessing! But the
   best proof of it all is experience. Ask either saint or sinner and you
   shall find that peace was never obtained in the way of the flesh. Turn
   to the Christian and he will tell you, "Therefore being justified BY
   FAITH, we have peace with God."

   He will tell you that when he turns away from faith and looks to
   himself his darkness begins at once. He will assure you that he never
   walks in perfect light and true comfort except when he keeps his eyes
   fast fixed upon the great Sacrifice of Calvary. I know, Brethren,
   whenever I am dull and drooping as to my eternal interests, it is
   always because I have thought more of my graces than of Christ's Grace,
   or more of the Spirit's work in me than of the finished work of Christ
   on my behalf. There is no living happily but by depending wholly upon
   Christ. A sinner resting upon his Savior as his only hope is blest.

   Now, if this is the experience of all saints, and if no sinner living
   will dare to tell you that he can get his conscience quiet by his own
   works--why do any of you try? Heaven bears witness that salvation by
   faith is certain--Hell bears witness that works do but ruin us. O, hear
   the double testimony and lay hold upon eternal life through the Person
   of Christ Jesus! O my dear Friend, if you are really panting for
   salvation, go not round and round these dreary performances of your own
   doings! It must all end in misery, disappointment and despair. "They
   rowed hard to bring it to land. But they could not."

   All human work which does not begin and end in the Lord Jesus must be a
   failure. All your works have been failures with you up to the present
   and so it will be to the end of the chapter. Give it up and God help
   you to try His method, for it is sure and efficacious.

   III. Now, with very great brevity, I will bring you to the third point
   of the sermon which is that THE SOUL'S SORROW WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE
   SO LONG AS IT RELIES UPON ITS OWN EFFORTS. What is the effect of all
   that the creature does before it believes in Christ? It may be
   overruled for good, but much of its effect is mischievous. The good
   effect which flows from it lies in this--the more a man strives to save
   himself, the more convinced will he become of his own impotence and
   powerlessness.

   I thought that I could turn to God whenever I pleased till I tried to
   turn to Him. I thought repentance a very easy thing till I began to
   repent. I dreamed that faith in Christ must be mere child's play till I
   had to groan, "Lord, help my unbelief!" As for the Law, when we attempt
   to keep it, we groan under a heavy burden which we have no strength to
   bear--

   "How long beneath the Law I lay in bondage and distress! I toiled, the
   precept to obey, But toiled without success."

   Oh, it is hard serving the Law! He is a cruel taskmaster. The whip is
   always going and the flesh is always bleeding. It is hard service.
   Weary and faint, we fall down under it and feel it to be a load
   intolerable to be borne. Well is Haggi chosen as the type of the Law,
   for indeed it genders unto bondage.

   And well was blazing Sinai chosen as its representative, for even Moses
   said, when standing upon that mountain, "I do exceedingly fear and
   quake." To be clean divorced from all legal hope is a blessed
   preparation for Gospel marriage with Christ. It was well that rowing
   hard made the mariners feel their inability to cope with the
   tempest--and it is best of all when creature efforts produce a clear
   discovery of creature weakness.

   Another good result will sometimes follow. The man passionately
   striving to save himself by keeping the Law finds out the spirituality
   of that Law, a spirituality which he never saw before. He has given up
   outward acts of sin, but all of a sudden he is startled to find that
   even though he has given them all up in open fact, he is still
   condemned for allowing the thoughts of them in his heart! Even a look
   may be fornication, though no act of sin shall follow it. He remembers
   that even the wish of his heart may be theft. And that covetousness is
   not only straining after another man's goods, but envying him the
   enjoyment of them.

   Now he finds the work is impossible, indeed, for he might sooner hold
   the winds in his fist than control his passions, or with his breath
   blow the sea into a calm sooner than he could restrain the impetuous
   propensities of his nature. O, Brethren, it is a good thing when we
   find that the Commandments of God are exceedingly broad--when we see
   the sharpness of this great axe of the Law and how it cuts at the very
   root of the tree and leaves us no green thing standing wherein we can
   boast!

   So far so good. Fleshly effort, overruled by Divine Grace, has helped
   us to the discovery of the grandeur and dignity of the Divine Law. But
   I am afraid that much of this toil and labor is very mischievous
   because it makes unbelief take a firmer grip. It is easier to comfort a
   soul who has been a short time in darkness than it is to comfort one
   who has given way a long time to an unbelieving state of heart. I
   remember one, I believe she is in darkness now and if I remember right
   it is ten years ago since she first fell into these doubts and fears. I
   am sometimes afraid she will never see the Light because it has become
   chronic with her.

   Giant Despair's prisoners do not all escape. He has a yard full of
   bones, remember. These are the relics of willing prisoners who would
   not be comforted and put out their own eyes to avoid the Light. I
   believe that some sinners make excuses for themselves out of their
   despair and that they let their doubts and fears grow till they cast a
   thick shadow, like Jonah's gourd. And then they sit down with a
   miserable sort of comfort beneath the leaves. "There is no hope,
   therefore will I go on in my sins. There is no hope for me, therefore
   let the worst come to me. I can but be damned. I will fold my arms and
   sit still."

   Oh, this is a damnable temptation! It is one which ruins multitudes I
   am sure! This is Satan's man-trap! Beware of it! This is the devil's
   stocks in the inner prison--he is to be pitied who is laid by the heels
   in them. While you are rowing hard to get your vessel to land and
   standing out against the gracious plan which God has ordained, you are
   letting the nightmare of unbelief grow into a dread reality! You are
   letting this deadly incubus rest more terribly upon your hearts. O,
   Sinner, I pray God deliver you from this work-mongering, this horrible
   trying to save yourself by something homegrown and home-spun. If we
   could cut off the head of your self-righteousness, we would have hope
   of you! If you would give up all attempts to deliver yourselves and
   leave the case in Christ's hands, the thing would be done!

   But while you are thus doubting and fearing, you are sinking deeper in
   the mire. And it is harder to get you out now than ever it was.
   Remember this one thing, that while the sinner is thus straining
   himself to get to Heaven by his own righteousness, his day of wrath is
   getting nearer. He is adding sin to sin. He is accumulating the fuel
   for his own burning, filling the sea of wrath in which he must be
   drowned forever. "What? When I am praying, groaning and crying to God
   and when I am trying to mend my ways and do my best, do you say I am
   only doing mischief?"

   I do say it. I say these things are good in themselves, but if you are
   resting in them, you are so flying in the teeth of God's great Gospel,
   so insulting the dignity of the great Savior that you are adding sin to
   sin! And among the firewood for your burning there shall be none so dry
   which shall burn so terribly as your own good wicked works, your own
   rebellious virtues, your own proud detestable righteousness which you
   set up in opposition to the merit, blood and righteousness of God's
   appointed Mediator!

   Gold is good enough, but if you bow down before the golden calf I will
   hate the gold because you worship it. Your morality is good enough, but
   if you trust to it I will hate your morality because it is your
   destruction. Sinner, I pray you remember that your life is being
   shortened all the while you tarry in the plains of self. Time flies and
   you fade like a leaf, while your righteousnesses, which are but filthy
   rags, are crying out against you! You are laboring without success. But
   more, you are losing time which might have been turned to better
   purpose. While you are spending your money for that which is not bread,
   you are getting nearer and nearer to the dread famine when there shall
   be no bread to buy.

   While you are trying to get this fool's oil with which to keep your
   lamps burning, the Bridegroom is coming and the midnight is hastening
   when you shall have to say, "Give us of your oil, for our lamps are
   gone out." There shall be no time, then, for you to buy for the
   darkness shall have come upon you and the door shall be shut and the
   Bridegroom's supper shall have begun. O that I could have some power to
   induce you not to follow any longer these fine ways of yours, these
   proud deceptive plans! O that you would receive God's plan of
   redemption and enjoy the peace which it brings!

   IV. We will try to explain God's plan and then we have done. That is
   our fourth point--THAT THE WAY OF

   SAFETY FOR SINNERS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE SACRIFICE OF ANOTHER ON THEIR
   BEHALF. Here is Jonah. Leave out the fact that he was sinful and he
   becomes an eminent type of Christ. "Take me up and cast me into the sea
   and the sea shall become calm under me." Substitution saves the
   mariners--Substitution saves sinners. This is the essential oil of
   Gospel Truth. Jesus Christ says to His people, "I am cast into the sea.
   There in that depth I sleep for a while, like Jonah, to rise again on
   the third day. But My being cast into the sea makes a deep calm for
   you." How very simple this process was. They take Jonah--he himself
   desires it--he is thrown overboard and the deeps swallow him up.

   Ah, poor Jonah, what a fall! What a terrible descent! What a frightful
   end to his prophetical career! Down he goes. Did I not see huge jaws
   opening amid the billows? Was he not devoured by some terrible monster!
   Poor fellow, he must have our pity! But how strange it is! Why the wind
   has ceased--it has dropped dead! And the waves seem to be playing now
   where they were battling fiercely a moment ago! No, the sea is glassy!
   We need not the oars any longer! Up with the sails, we shall soon be
   safely in port!

   An odd thing this, the drowning of one becomes the safety of all.
   Mariners, let us sacrifice to Jonah's God. Ah, it is a strange and
   marvelous thing! It is that which sets angels singing and makes the
   redeemed spirits wonder on forever, that Jesus came down into this ship
   of our common humanity to deliver it from tempest. The vessel had been
   tossed about on all sides by the waves of Divine wrath. Men had been
   tugging and toiling at the oar. Year after year philosopher and teacher
   had been seeking to establish peace with God. Victims had been offered
   and rivers of blood had flowed and even the first-born of man's body
   had been offered up.

   But the deep was still tempestuous. Then Jesus came and they took Him
   and cast Him overboard. Out of the city they dragged Him. "Away with
   Him! Away with Him! It is not fit that He should live!" Out of all
   comfort they had cast Him long ago--now from society they cast Him,
   too. From pity they cast Him! From all sympathy they cast Him! And at
   last from life itself they hurled Him, while God stands there to help
   them to cast Him into a sea of woes. As He, Jesus, dies there is a
   calm. Deep was the peace which fell upon the earth that dreadful day.
   And joyous is that calm which yet shall come as the result of the
   casting out of that representative Man who suffered--the Just for the
   unjust to bring us to God!

   Brethren, I wish I had better words with which I could fitly describe
   the peace which comes to a human heart when we learn to see Jesus cast
   into the sea of Divine wrath on our account. Conscience accuses no
   longer. Judgment now decides for the sinner instead of against him.
   Memory can look back upon past sins, with sorrow for the sin it is
   true, but yet with no dread of any penalty to come! It is a blessed
   thing for a man to know that he cannot be punished, that Heaven and
   earth may shake, but he cannot be punished for his sin!

   If God is unjust I may be damned. But if God is just I never can be.
   That is how the saved sinner stands. Christ has paid the debt of His
   people to the last jot and tittle and received the Divine receipt. And
   unless God can be so unjust as to demand twice payment for one debt, no
   soul for whom Jesus died can ever be cast into Hell. It seems to be one
   of the very principles of our nature to believe that God is just. We
   feel it and that gives us our terror at first. But is it not marvelous
   that this very same first principle, the belief that God is just,
   becomes afterwards the pillar of our confidence and peace?

   If God is just, I, a sinner, alone and without a substitute, must be
   punished. Christ stands in my place and is punished for me. And now, if
   God is just, I, a sinner, standing in Christ, can never be punished!
   God must change His Nature before one soul for whom Christ was a
   Substitute, can ever by any possibility suffer the lash of the Law. I
   must confess I do not understand the atonements which some preach. An
   atonement which does not atone--a redemption which does not redeem--a
   redemption which intends to redeem all men born of Adam and yet leaves
   the major part in slavery--an atonement which makes full atonement for
   all human sin and leaves men to be condemned afterwards--I cannot
   comprehend that!

   But I do understand a Substitution--Christ taking the place of the
   Believer--Christ suffering the quid pro quo for the Believer's
   punishment--Christ rendering an equivalent to Divine wrath for all that
   His people ought to have suffered as the result of sin. I right well
   and right joyously understand that the Believer, knowing that Christ
   suffered in his place, can shout with glorious triumph, "Who shall lay
   anything to the charge of God's elect?" Not God, for He has justified!
   Not Christ, for He has died, "yes rather has risen again." My hope is
   not because I am not a sinner, but because I AM a sinner for whom
   Christ died. My trust is not that I am holy, but that being unholy
   Christ died for me!

   My rest is here, not in what I am or shall be, or feel, or know, but in
   what Christ is and must be! In what Christ did and is still doing as He
   stands before yonder Throne of Glory. O Beloved, it is a blessed thing
   to get right out of self. But many Believers seem to have one foot on
   self and one on Christ. They are like the angel with one foot on the
   sea and the other on the land--only being angels--they cannot stand on
   such a footing. Put both feet on the Rock, Beloved! Stand altogether on
   Christ!

   Arminianism is one foot on Christ and the other foot on self. "Christ
   has saved me," says the Arminian. There is His foot on the land. "But,"
   he says, "I must hold on. It depends upon me whether I persevere to the
   end." There is his foot on the sea. If he does not look out, that foot
   will give way. But how blessed it is when the Christian can say, "I am
   saved." There is no if, no but about it. There is nothing for me to do
   to complete my salvation. It is all done. There is not one jot or
   tittle left to complete the Covenant of my salvation. The Covenant of
   effectual Grace is all written out in the fair handwriting of my Savior
   with a pen dipped in His own blood, and it guarantees all spiritual
   blessings to me forever! The edifice has been built and there is not
   wanted a beam or a brick, or even a nail or a tin tack to complete it!

   From its foundation to its top stone it is all of Grace and all
   perfect. My garment of salvation has been woven from the top
   throughout--there is not a rag of thread or stitch of mine wanted to
   complete it. "It is finished," said the Savior, as He dipped it for the
   last time in the glorious carmine of His own blood and made a rich
   royal robe for His people to wear forever! O Brethren, if there were
   one stone to be put to the walls of our salvation--one single trowel
   full of mortar to make the stones set firmly--it would be all undone,
   all in ruin. But the whole of it has been completed! Stone and mortar,
   from basement to summit--all has been completed by Sovereign Grace!

   And what shall you and I do? Since Jesus has been cast overboard for
   us, let us now rest in perfect quiet. Let us enjoy the peace "that
   passes all understanding, which shall keep our hearts and minds through
   Christ Jesus." And then, having been saved in such a way as this, let
   us now go to work for God--not to win life, not to win Heaven--life and
   Heaven are ours already! But loved by Him let us now love Him with a
   perfect heart!

   The man who has not attained to rest in Jesus is incapable of virtue. A
   man who does anything for his own salvation acts from a selfish motive,
   does everything for himself. He has no virtue in him. But the man who
   is saved, who knows there is nothing for him to do, either to put
   himself into salvation or to keep himself in it--knowing that all is
   now finished, having no need to do anything for self--he does
   everything for God and is holy in heart and life. Now he can sing with
   Toplady--

   "Loved of my God, for Him again, With love intense I'd burn. Chosen of
   Him before time began, I'd choose Him in return."

   Let us show that this is the true root of virtue. Let us teach men who
   say this doctrine is licentious that it is the most heavenly soil in
   which the fruits of the Spirit can grow! Like a genial sunshine is this
   doctrine to our fruits to ripen them! Like a heavenly shower to bring
   them forth! God give you, Sinner, to rest in my Savior! God give you,
   Saint, to live to your Savior and He shall have the praise in both
   cases. Amen.

                              What God Cannot Do!

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, MAY 8, 1864, BY THE REV. C. H. SPURGEON,
   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "God, that cannot lie." Titus 1:2.

   TRUTH once reigned supreme upon our globe and then earth was Paradise.
   Man knew no sorrow while he was ignorant of falsehood. The Father of
   Lies invaded the garden of bliss and with one foul lie he blighted Eden
   into a wilderness and made man a traitor to his God. Cunningly he
   handled the glittering falsehood and made it dazzle in the woman's
   eyes--"God does know that in the day you eat thereof, then your eyes
   shall be opened and you shall be as gods, knowing good and evil."

   Proud ambition rode upon that lie as a conqueror in his chariot and the
   city of Mansoul opened its gates to welcome the fascinating enemy. As
   it was a lie which first subjugated the world to Satan's influences, so
   it is by lies that he secures his throne. Among the heathen his kingdom
   is quiet and secure, because the minds of the people are deluded with a
   false mythology. The domains of Mahomet and the Pope are equally the
   kingdom of Satan and his reign is undisturbed, for human merit,
   priestly efficacy, and a thousand other deceptions buttress his throne.
   The darkness of ignorance, the dungeons of falsehood and the chains of
   superstition are the main reliance of that monster who oppresses all
   the nations with his infernal tyranny.

   Since by the lie Satan now holds the world and maintains his power, he
   everywhere encourages lies and aids their propagation. Look about you
   and see what a prolific family falsehood has! The children of the
   untrue are as many as the frogs of Egypt, and like those plagues, they
   intrude into every chamber. The slime of falsehood may be seen upon
   most things, both in secular and religious life. You have lying news
   and garbled reports in print. And as for the flying gossip of the
   tongue, if it touches the characters of good men, beware of believing a
   word it utters. If you would not have complicity with those who make
   the lie, be not hasty to entertain it.

   From the high places of the earth falsehood is not excluded. The
   untruth glides right royally from the kingly tongue, but is as much a
   lie as if the ragged mendicant had blurted it forth with low-lived
   oaths and curses. What is diplomacy for the most part? Is it not "the
   art of lying"? Was not he thought to be the best politician who used
   language to conceal his thoughts? In how many a conference have the
   plenipotentiaries labored which could overreach, dissimulate and
   intrigue to the greatest degree?

   In the commerce of courts who knows not that flatteries and lies are
   the most abundant commodities? The art of king-craft, as practiced by
   the most high and mighty Prince James, whose name dishonors our English
   Bible, was only and simply the science of lying in the neatest possible
   manner. In these modern times, the difference between the promises of
   the politicians and the performances in the House of Commons proves
   that the lie is still commonly patronized. Falsehood is everywhere. It
   is entertained both by the lowest and the highest. It permeates all
   society. It has ruined the whole of our race and so defiled the entire
   world that upright men exclaim, "Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech,
   that I dwell in the tents of Kedar!"

   In the so-called religious world, which should be as the Holy of
   Holies, here, too, the lie has insinuated itself. Of old there were
   prophets who prophesied lies and dreamers of false dreams. And there
   were others who spoke the Word of God with such bated breath and after
   such a fashion that it was no longer the Truth as it came from God, but
   truth alloyed with human falsehood. It is so today. There are those
   wearing the vestments of God's priests who do not hesitate to profess
   what they do not believe. Such men are the priests of Hell. To wear a
   bishop's miter and teach infidelity--how shall I stigmatize it? It is
   nothing less than detestable hypocrisy and robbery.

   And what shall I say of men of all creeds, all subscribing to the same
   articles and catechism when all the world knows they cannot all
   honestly believe the same thing and yet differ as much from one another
   as light from darkness? What shall I say but that shame covers my face
   that there should be so many ministers of God who are untrue to their
   convictions and continue to do and say what they feel to be
   unscriptural? In other quarters philosophy is believed and Christianity
   professed--the traditions of men are put in the place of God's Truth.
   The prophets prophesy lies and the people love to have it so.

   Brethren, we have everywhere to battle with falsehood and if we are to
   bless the world we must confront it with sturdy face and zealous
   spirit. God's purpose is to drive the lie out of the world and let this
   be your purpose and mine. His Holy Spirit has undertaken to drive
   falsehood out of our hearts--be this our determination, in His
   strength--that it shall be cut up root and branch and utterly consumed.
   Then let us walk in the Truth of God. "Buy the Truth and sell it not,"
   hold fast the Truth, speak the Truth in love and act the Truth in all
   our deeds, for so shall we be known to be the children of that God of
   whom our text asserts that He is "God, that cannot lie."

   After wandering over the sandy desert of deceit, how pleasant is it to
   reach our text and feel that one spot, at least, is verdant with
   eternal Truth! Blessed be You, O God, for You cannot lie!

   We will use our text in the following manner this morning--first, while
   we do not attempt to prove it, we will remind you of a few things which
   may confirm your confidence that God cannot lie so that our opening
   remarks shall be upon the truth of the text. Then secondly, we will
   speak upon the breadth of the text, endeavoring to show that we must
   give no narrow interpretation to the words before us, but must receive
   them with an extent of meaning not usual to the expression. And then,
   thirdly, we will try to use the text for our own improvement, arguing
   from it that if God cannot lie He ought to receive our loving
   confidence.

   I. First, then, let us commune together awhile concerning THE TRUTH OF
   THE TEXT, not, as we have said, to prove it, because we all believe it,
   but to confirm our confidence of it. I think we shall feel assured that
   God cannot lie when we remember that He is not subject to those
   infirmities which lead us into falsehood. Lord Bacon has said, "There
   are three parts in truth--first, the enquiry, which is the wooing of
   it. Secondly, the knowledge of it, which is the presence of it. And
   thirdly, the belief, which is the enjoyment of it."

   In each of these three points, by reason of infirmity, men fail to be
   perfectly true. In the search after truth, our moral eye is not
   altogether clear and therefore we fail to see what we love not. We do
   not follow truth in a straight line, but are very liable to turn aside
   to the right hand or to the left, either to obey our prejudices or
   advance our profit. "Truth lies in a well," said the old philosopher.
   Many go down into that well to find Truth, but looking into the water
   they see their own faces and become so desperately enamored of their
   own beauty that they forget poor Truth, or dream that she is the
   counterpart of themselves.

   Now the great God cannot be liable to this error, because there is no
   discovery of truth with Him. He needs not to search anything out, for
   "all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of Him with whom we have
   to do." When in Scripture that term is sometimes used--"Shall not God
   search this out?"--when we hear Him spoken of as "searching the heart
   and trying the reins of the children of men," it is not because He is
   not perfectly acquainted with all things, but only to set forth the
   certainty and accuracy of Divine knowledge.

   God has no need to search, or if He had, having nothing in Him which
   should lead Him to make a dishonest search, He does not lie. When we
   have searched out the Truth of God there is the knowing of it. And here
   the falsehood gets a footing in the form of a sin of omission, for we
   often refuse to know all that we might know. It would be inconvenient,
   perhaps, for us to be too well acquainted with certain arguments, for
   then our prejudices must be given up and therefore we close our eyes to
   them for fear of knowing the truth.

   Do not many men leave passages of Scripture altogether unread because
   they have no wish to receive the doctrines which are taught in them?
   Every time you refuse to give a hearing to God's Truth, you do in
   effect lie because you prefer not to know the Truth of God, which is
   really to prefer to hold error. Now nothing of this kind can ever
   happen with our only wise God. He knows all Truth, seeing it all at a
   glance and retaining it ever in His mind. In nothing is He ignorant,
   either willfully or otherwise.

   He receives Truth as His own Beloved and when the world casts her out,
   she finds a happy shelter beneath His shield. We are quite clear that
   we frequently fall into the lie through a defect in our believing, for
   we sometimes know more than we care to believe. Truth is grasped by the
   understanding but thrust out by the affections. We know her as Peter
   knew his

   Lord and yet deny it after the same fashion as that disciple did his
   Master. Moreover, through weakness, we are led to doubt what we know to
   be God's Truth and even to speak unadvisedly with our lips.

   Now this can never occur with God, since God is One and is not to be
   divided into parts and passions and His tongue can never be diverse
   from His heart. God's tongue is His heart and God's heart is His hand.
   God is One. You and I are such that we can know in the heart, and yet
   with the tongue deny. But God is One and indivisible. God is Light, and
   in Him is no darkness at all. With Him is no variableness, neither
   shadow of turning.

   Then again, the Scriptural idea of God forbids that He should lie. Just
   review your thoughts about God, if you can. What idea have you formed
   of Him? If you have read Holy Scripture and have gotten the slightest
   shadow of an idea of God, I think you will see that it is utterly
   inconsistent with the thrice Holy One, whose kingdom is over all, that
   He should lie. Admit the very possibility of His speaking an untruth
   and to the Christian there would be no God at all. The depraved mind of
   the heathen may imagine a monster to be a god who can live in adultery
   and in theft and in lying, for such the gods of the Hindus are
   described as being. But the enlightened mind of the Christian can
   conceive no such thing. The very word "God" comprehends everything
   which is good and great. Admit the lie and to us at once there would be
   nothing but the black darkness of Atheism. I could neither love,
   worship, nor obey a lying God.

   Again, we all know that God is too wise to lie. Falsehood is the
   expedient of a fool. It is only a short-sighted man who lies. For some
   present advantage the poor creature who cannot see the end as well as
   the beginning states that which is not. But no wise man who can look
   far into the future ever thinks a lie to be profitable. He knows that
   Truth may suffer loss at first but that in the long run she is always
   successful. He endorses that worldly-wise proverb, that, "Honesty is
   the best policy" after all. And the man, I say, who has anything like
   foresight, or judgment, or wisdom, prefers always the straight line to
   the curve and goes directly to the mark, believing that this is in the
   end the best.

   Do you suppose that God, who must know this, with an intensity of
   knowledge infinitely greater than ours, will choose the policy of the
   witless knave? Shall God, only wise, who sees the end from the
   beginning, act as only brainless fools will choose to behave
   themselves? Oh, it cannot be, my Brethren! God, the All-Wise, must also
   be All-True. And the lie, again, is the method of the little and the
   mean. You know that a great man does not lie. A good man can never be
   false. Put goodness and greatness together and a lie is altogether
   incongruous to the character.

   Now God is too great to need the lie and too good to wish to do such a
   thing! Both His greatness and His goodness repel the thought. My dear
   Friends, what motive could God have for lying? When a man lies it is
   that he may gain something, but "the cattle on a thousand hills" are
   God's and all the beasts of the forest and all the flocks of the
   meadows. He says, "if I were hungry I would not tell you." Mines of
   inexhaustible riches are His and treasures of infinite power and
   wisdom. He cannot gain anything by untruth, for "the earth is the
   Lord's and the fullness thereof." Why, then, should

   He lie?

   Men are false, oftentimes, to win applause. See how the sycophant
   cringes to the tyrant's foot and spawns his villainy. But God needs no
   honor and no fame, especially from the wicked. To Him it were the
   greatest disgust of His righteous soul to be loved by unholy creatures.
   His Glory is great enough even if there were no creatures! His own
   self-contained Glory is such that if there were no eyes to see it and
   no ears to hear it, He would be infinitely glorious. He asks
   nothing--no respect and no honor of man--and therefore has He no need
   to stoop to the lie to gain it. And of whom, again, could He be afraid?
   Men will sometimes, under the impulse of fear, keep back or even
   contradict the truth, but can fear ever enter into the heart of the
   eternal God?

   He looks down upon all nations who are in rebellion against Him and He
   does not even care to rise to put them down. "He that sits in the
   heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision!" Are not the
   chariots of the Lord twenty thousand, even thousands of angels? Even
   these are but as a drop in a bucket, when compared with the deep and
   infinite sea of His own power. Who, then, shall think that Jehovah
   needs to be afraid? "Fear," and "Jehovah," are two words which cannot
   meet together. Therefore, since there can be no motive whatever which
   should possibly lead God to lie, we feel well assured that the
   declaration of Paul is most certainly true--"God, that cannot lie."

   Moreover, dear Friends, we may add to all this the experience of men
   with regard to God. It has been evident enough in all ages that God
   cannot lie. He did not lie when Adam fell. It seemed a strange thing,
   that after all the skill and labor which had been spent in making such
   a world as this, so fair and beautiful, God should resign it to the
   dominion of Satan and drive the man whom He had made in His own image,
   out of his home, his Eden, to labor in sweat and toil and suffer- ing
   until he came to his grave. But God did it and the fiery sword at the
   gate of Eden was proof that God could not and would not lie.

   He might come to Adam and bemoan himself, crying, "Adam, where are
   you?" as if He pitied him and would, if it had been possible, have
   spared the stroke. But still it must be done and Eden is blasted and
   Adam becomes a wanderer upon the fruitless earth. Then afterwards, to
   quote a notable instance of God's faithfulness, when the flood swept
   away the race of men and Noah came forth the heritor of a new Covenant,
   we have clear proof that God cannot lie. No flood has ever destroyed
   the earth since then. Partial floods there have been and parts of
   provinces have been inundated, but no flood has ever come upon the
   earth of such a character as that which Noah saw--therefore the
   rainbow, every time it is painted upon the cloud--is an assurance to us
   that God cannot lie.

   Then He made an oath with Abraham that he should have a son and that
   his seed should become possessors of all the land in which the
   Patriarch had sojourned. Did not that come true? They waited in Egypt
   two hundred years. They smarted under the tyrant's lash. They lay among
   the pots and yet, after all, with a high hand and with an outstretched
   arm He brought forth His people, led them through the wilderness and
   divided Canaan by lot to them, having driven out the inhabitants of the
   land before them. Since that time He made His Covenant with David and
   how fast has that stood! All the threats which He has uttered against
   the enemies of Israel--how surely have they been fulfilled!

   Last of all and best of all, when the fullness of time was come, did
   not God send forth His own Son, born of a woman, made under the Law?
   Did He not, according to His ancient promise, lay upon Him the iniquity
   of us all? Were not the Incarnation and death of our Lord Jesus the
   grandest proof of the truthfulness of God which could be afforded? His
   own Son must leave Heaven emptied of His Glory, must be given up to be
   despised and rejected of men, must be nailed to the accursed wood and
   be forsaken in the hour of His bitterest grief--herein is Truth,
   indeed! I say if this must be according to the promise and if this was
   according to the fact, then we have the clearest and the surest
   evidence that God cannot by any possibility be false to His own Word.
   Rightly has He earned the title which His Nature claims--"God, that
   cannot lie."

   May I not add as another argument that you have found Him true? You
   have been to Him, dear Friends, in many times of trial. You have taken
   His promise and laid it before His Mercy Seat. What do you say--has He
   ever broken His promise? You have been through the floods--did He leave
   you? You have passed through the fires--were you burned? You have cried
   to Him in trouble--did He fail to deliver you? O you poor and needy
   ones, you have been brought very low, but has He not been your Helper?
   You have passed hard by the gates of the grave and Hell has opened its
   horrid jaws to swallow you up, but are you not today the living
   monuments of the fidelity of God to His promise and the veracity of
   every Word of the Most High God? Let these things, then, refresh your
   memories that you may the more confidently know that He is "God, that
   cannot lie."

   II. Let us pass on to look at THE BREADTH OF MEANING IN THE TEXT. When
   we are told in Scripture that

   God cannot lie there is usually associated with the idea the thought of
   immutability. As for instance--"He is not a man that He should lie, nor
   the son of man that He should repent." The word "lie," here includes
   beyond its ordinary meaning the thought of change, so that when we read
   that God cannot lie, we understand by it not only that He cannot say
   what is untrue, but that having said something which is true, He never
   changes from it and does not by any possibility alter His purpose or
   retract His Word.

   This is very consolatory to the Christian, that whatever God has said
   in the Divine purpose is never changed. The Decrees of God were not
   written upon sand, but upon the eternal brass of His unchangeable
   Nature. We may truly say of the sealed Book of the Decrees, "Has He
   said and shall He not do it? Has He purposed and shall it not come to
   pass?" We read in Scripture of several instances where God apparently
   changed, but I think the observation of the old Puritan explains all
   these, He says, "God may will a change, but He cannot change His will."
   Those changes of operation which we sometimes read of in Scripture did
   not involve any change in the Divine purpose!

   God, for instance, sent to warn Hezekiah that according to the common
   course of nature he must die, and yet afterwards fifteen years were
   added to his life--God's purpose having been all along that Hezekiah
   should live till the end of the fifteen years. But still His purpose
   equally included that Hezekiah should be brought so near to the gates
   of death that in the ordinary course of nature he must die. And then
   that the miracle should come in was still part of the purpose, that
   Hezekiah might be cured in a supernatural manner and be made to live
   nearer to his God in consequence. God wills a change, but He never
   changes His will.

   And when the Last Great Day shall come, you and I shall see how
   everything happened according to that hidden roll wherein God had
   written with His own wise finger every thought which man should think,
   every word which he should utter and every deed which he should do.
   Just as it was in the Book of Decree, so shall it transpire in the roll
   of human history. God never changes, then, as to His purpose and here
   is our comfort. If He has determined to save us and we know He has, for
   all who believe in Him are His elect, then we shall be saved. Heaven
   shall never by any possibility be defeated by Hell. Hell and earth may
   combine together to destroy a soul which rests upon Christ, but while
   God's Decree stands fast and firm, that chosen soul is safe! And since
   that Decree never can be removed, let us take confidence and rejoice.

   No promise has ever been altered and no threat, either. Still is His
   promise sure. "I have not said unto the seed of Jacob, seek you My face
   in vain." No new decrees have been passed repealing the past. We can
   never say of God's Book, as we can of old law books, that such-and-such
   an act is obsolete. There is no obsolete Statute in God's Book. There
   stand promises, as fresh, as new, as vigorous and as forceful today as
   when they first dropped from the mouth of God. The words, then, "God,
   that cannot lie," include the very gracious and precious doctrine that
   He cannot by any possibility change.

   But we must not, while talking in this manner, forget the primary
   meaning, that He cannot be false in His thoughts, Words, or actions.
   There is no shadow of a lie upon anything which God thinks, or speaks,
   or does. He cannot lie in His prophecies. How solemnly true have they
   been! Ask the wastes of Nineveh! Turn to the mounds of Babylon! Let the
   traveler speak concerning Idumea and Petra. Turn even to the rock of
   Sidon and to Your land, O Immanuel! We may boldly ask the traveler,
   "Has He said and has He not done it? Have His words fallen to the
   ground? Has God's curse been an idle Word?" No, not in one single case.

   All the words of the Lord are sure. The prophecies will be as true as
   they have been and the Book of Revelation, though we may not comprehend
   it today, will doubtless be fulfilled in every stroke and in every line
   and we shall marvel how it was that we did not know its meaning. But at
   present it is enough for us to know its Truth--its meaning shall only
   be learned as the events explain the prophesy. As God is true in His
   prophecies, so is He faithful to His promises. Have you and I, dear
   Friends, a confidence in these? If so, let us try them this morning.

   Sinner, weeping and bemoaning yourself, God will forgive you your sin
   if you believe in Jesus! If you will confess that He is faithful and
   just to forgive you, He has promised to do so and He cannot lie.
   Christian, if you have a promise today laid upon your heart, if you
   have been pleading it, perhaps for months and it has not been
   fulfilled, I pray you gather fresh courage this morning and again renew
   your wrestling. Go and say, "Lord, I know You cannot lie, therefore
   fulfill Your Word unto Your servant."

   If the promises of God were not kept, God would lie. They must,
   therefore, be fulfilled. And let us believe that they will be and go to
   God, not with a wavering spirit which half hopes that the Words may be
   true, but with the full assurance that they cannot fail! As certainly
   as we know that day and night shall not cease and that summer will not
   fail, so surely let us be convinced that every Word of the Lord shall
   stand!

   His threats are true, also. Ah, Sinner, you may go on in your ways for
   many a day, but your sin shall find you out at last. Seventy years
   God's long-suffering may wait over you, but when you shall come into
   another world you shall find every terrible Word of Scripture
   fulfilled. You shall then know that there is a place, "where their worm
   dies not and the fire is not quenched." You shall then experience the
   "wailing and gnashing of teeth" unless you repent. If you will believe
   in Jesus you shall find the promise true! But if you will not, equally
   sure shall be the threat.

   This is a dreadful part of the subject to those who are out of Christ,
   who have never been partakers of the Holy Spirit. It will be in vain
   for you to cry to Him, then, and ask Him, then, to change His mind. No,
   though you should weep oceans of tears, Hell's flames cannot be
   quenched nor can your soul escape from the place to which it is finally
   doomed! Today, while mercy is preached to you, lay hold upon it! But
   remember, if you do not, as God cannot lie He cannot suffer you to
   escape--you must feel the weight and terror of His arm.

   We might thus go through everything which concerns God, from prophesy
   to promises and threats and onwards and multiply observations but we
   choose to close this point by observing that every word of instruction
   from God is most certainly true. It is astounding how much sensation is
   caused in the Christian Church by the outbreak, every now and then, of
   fresh phases of infidelity. I do not think that these alarms are at all
   warranted. It is what we must expect to the very end of this
   dispensation.

   If all carnal minds believed the Bible, I think the spiritual might
   almost begin to doubt it. But as there are always some who will attack
   it, I shall feel none the less confident in it. Really, the Book of God
   has stood so many attacks from such different quarters that to be at
   all alarmed about it shows a very childish fear. When a rock has been
   standing all our lifetime and has been known to stand firmly throughout
   all the ages of history, none but foolish people will think that the
   next wave will sweep it away.

   Within our own short life--say some five-and-twenty years'
   recollection--have we not remembered, I was about to say almost as many
   as five-and-twenty shapes of infidelity? You know it must change about
   every twenty years at least, for no system of infidelity can live
   longer than that! There was the witty system of objection which
   Voltaire introduced. And how short-lived was that! Then came the
   bullying, low-lived, blackguard system of Tom Paine. And how
   short-lived was its race! Then, in more modern times, unbelief took the
   shape of Secularism--what particular shapes it takes now we scarcely
   know--perhaps Colensoism is the most fashionable--but that is dying out
   and something else will follow it.

   These creations of an hour just live their little day and they are
   gone. But look at belief in Scripture and at Scripture itself. The
   Bible is better understood, more prized, and I believe, on the whole,
   more practiced than ever it was since the day when its Author sent it
   abroad into the world. It is still onward. And after all which has been
   done against it, no visible effect has been produced upon the granite
   wall of Scriptural Truth by all the pickaxes and boring rods which have
   been broken upon it.

   Walking through our Museums nowadays, we smile at those who think that
   Scripture is not true. Every block of stone from Nineveh, every relic
   which has been brought from the Holy Land speaks with a tongue which
   must be heard even by the deaf adder of Secularism and which says,
   "Yes, the Bible is true and the Word of God is no fiction." Beloved, we
   may rest assured that we have not a Word in the Book of God which is
   untrue. There may be an interpolation or two of man's which ought to be
   revised and taken away, but the Book, as it comes from God, is Truth
   and nothing but Truth--not only containing God's Word, but being God's
   Word--being not like a lump of gold inside a mass of quartz, but all
   gold and nothing but gold!

   And being Inspired to the highest degree--I will not say verbally
   inspired, but more than that--having a fullness more than that which
   the letter can convey! Having in it a profundity of meaning such as
   words never had when used by any other being, God having the power to
   speak a multitude of Truths at once. And when He means to teach us one
   thing according to our capability of receiving it, He often teaches us
   twenty other things which, for the time, we do not comprehend but
   which, by-and-by, as our senses are exercised, reveal themselves by the
   Holy Spirit. Every time I open my Bible I will read it as the Word of
   "God, that cannot lie." And when I get a promise or a threat, I will
   either rejoice or tremble because I know that these stand fast.

   Dear Friends, this leads us, in closing this point, to say that when we
   read that passage--"God, that cannot lie"-- we understand that His very
   Nature cannot lie, for He hates lies! Wherever there is a lie God is
   its Enemy. It was to overcome the lie of sin that God sent His Son to
   bleed. And every day the thoughts of God are centered upon the
   extermination of evil and the extension of His own Truth. Nothing can
   set forth in words to us the hatred and detestation which God has in
   His heart of anything which is untrue. O that we knew and felt this and
   would glow with the same anger, seeking to exterminate the false,
   slaying it in our own hearts and giving it nothing to feed upon in our
   temper, our conversation, or our deeds!

   III. But I shall now come to make a practical use of the text, in the
   third place, by observing HOW WE OUGHT TO ACT TOWARDS GOD IF IT IS TRUE
   THAT HE IS A "GOD THAT CANNOT LIE." Brethren, if it is so that God
   cannot lie, then it must be the natural duty of all His creatures to
   believe Him. I cannot resist that conclusion. It seems to me to be as
   clear as noonday that it is every man's duty to believe the Truth of
   God, and that if God must speak and act Truth and Truth only, it is the
   duty of all intelligent creatures to believe Him.

   Here is "Duty-faith" again, which some are railing at, but how they can
   get away from it and yet believe that God cannot lie, I cannot
   understand. If it is not my duty to believe in God, then it is no sin
   for me to call God a liar. Will anyone subscribe to that--that God is a
   liar? I think not. And if to think God to be a liar would be a most
   atrocious piece of blasphemy, then it can only be so on the ground that
   it is the natural and incumbent duty of every creature understand- ing
   the truthfulness of God to believe in God! If God has set forth the
   Lord Jesus Christ as the Propitiation for sin and has told me to trust
   Christ, it is my duty to trust Christ, because God cannot lie.

   And though my sinful heart will never believe in Christ as a matter of
   duty but only through the work of the Holy Spirit, yet faith does not
   cease to be a duty. And whenever I am unbelieving and have doubts
   concerning God, however moral my outward life may be, I am living in
   daily sin! I am perpetrating a sin against the first principles of
   morality. If I doubt God, as far as I am able I rob Him of His honor
   and stab Him in the vital point of His Glory. I am, in fact, living an
   open traitor and a sworn rebel against God upon whom I heap the daily
   insult of daring to doubt Him.

   my Hearers, there are some of you who do not believe in Christ! I wish
   you would look at your character and position in this light. You are
   not trusting in Christ for your salvation. Remember, "He that believes
   not God, has made Him a liar." Those are John's own Inspired Words and
   you are, every day that you are not a Believer in Christ, virtually
   writing upon your doorpost and saying with your mouth, "God is a liar.
   Christ is not able to save me. I will not trust Him. I do not believe
   God's promise. I do not think He is sincere in His invitation to me to
   come to Christ. I do not believe what God says."

   Remember that you are living in such a state as this and may God the
   Holy Spirit impress you with a sense of the sin of that state. And
   feeling this your sin and misery, I pray God to lead you to cry, "Lord,
   I believe, help You my unbelief!" This, then, is our first practical
   conclusion from the fact that God cannot lie. Other thoughts suggest
   themselves. If we were absolutely sure that there lived on earth a
   person who could not lie, how would you treat him? You know there
   cannot be such a man! There may be a man who will not lie, but there
   cannot be a man of whom it may be said that he cannot lie, for alas, we
   have all the power of evil in us and we can lie and to a certain degree
   it is quite true that "all men are liars."

   But if you could be certain that there was a man out of whose heart the
   black drop had been wrung and that he could not lie--how would you act
   towards him? Well, I think you would cultivate his acquaintance. If you
   are true yourselves, you would desire his friendship. You would say,
   "He is the friend for me! I have trusted in such-and-such a man and he
   has played the Judas. I asked counsel of another, and he was an
   Ahithophel. But if this man cannot lie, he shall be my bosom companion
   if he will accept me. And he shall be my counselor if he will but have
   the goodness to direct me."

   1 should expect to see a levee of all the good in the world waiting at
   the man's door! You know how the world, with all its sinfulness, does
   reverence the man who is true! We had an instance in our streets the
   other day of the good man and the true, who received homage of all and
   yet that man could lie. But inasmuch as we never have seen that he did,
   but his life has been straightforward, therefore have we paid him honor
   and deservedly so. Well now, if such is the case, should not all
   Christians seek more and more the friendship of God. "O Lord, be You my
   familiar Friend, my Counselor, my Guide. If You cannot lie I will lay
   bare my heart to You. I will tell You all my secrets. I will trust You
   with all the desires of my heart. I know You can never betray me, or be
   unfaithful. Let there be a union established between my soul and Yours,
   and let it never be broken." Let communion with God be the desire of
   your hearts on the ground that He cannot lie.

   If we knew a man who could not lie we should believe him, I think,
   without an oath. I cannot suppose that when he came into the court of
   justice they would pass him the Bible. No, his word would be better
   than the oath of ordinary men if he could not lie. You would not need
   any sign or evidence to prove what he said. You would take his word at
   once. So should it be with God. Ah, dear Friends, God has given us more
   than His Word, He has given us His Oath. And yet, strange is it that we
   who profess to be His children are vile enough to distrust our own
   Father. And sometimes, if He does not give us signs and evidences, we
   begin to distrust Him so that, after all, I am afraid we rather trust
   the signs than trust God and put more confidence in frames and
   evidences than we do in the naked promise, which is an atrocious sin,
   indeed!

   Many Believers cannot be comfortable without signs and evidences. When
   they feel in a good frame of mind--ah, then God's promise is true! When
   they can pray heartily, when they can feel the love of God shed abroad
   in their hearts, then they say, "How God has kept His promise." Ah,
   but, my Brothers and Sisters, that is a seeing faith. "Blessed are they
   that have not seen and yet have believed." Faith is to believe in God
   when my heart is as hard as the nether millstone! When my frames are
   bad, when I cannot pray, when I cannot sing, when I can do nothing
   good. To say, "He has promised and will perform. He has said that
   whoever believes in Christ is not condemned. I do believe in Christ and
   therefore I am not condemned"--this is genuine faith.

   Again, if we knew a man who could not lie we should believe him in the
   teeth of fifty witnesses the other way. Why, we should say, "they may
   say what they will, but they can lie." You might have good evidence
   that they were usually honest men, but you would say, "They can lie.
   They have the power of lying. But here is a man who stands alone and
   cannot lie. Then his word must be true!"

   This shows us, Beloved, that we ought to believe God in the teeth of
   every contradiction. Even if outward Providence should come to you and
   say that God has forsaken you, that is only one. And even if another
   and another and another should come and fifty trials should all say
   that God has forsaken you, yet, as God says, "I will never leave you,
   nor forsake you," which will you take--the one promise of God who
   cannot lie, or the fifty outward Providences which you cannot
   interpret? I know what the devil has been whispering in your ear--

   "The Lord has quite forsaken you, Your God will be gracious no more."

   But then, remember who has said, "Fear you not, for I am with you: be
   not dismayed, for I am your God." Which will you believe--the devil's
   insinuation, or God's own testimony? My dear Sister, you have been
   praying for a certain thing for years? You pray, you pray, and you pray
   again, and now discouragement arises! Unbelief says, "God will not hear
   that prayer! That prayer of yours does not come up before the Throne of
   God and there will be no answer." But the Lord has said, "Ask and it
   shall be given you. Seek and you shall find. Knock and it shall be
   opened unto you." Which will you believe--your unbelief--the long
   months of weariness and the anxieties which prompted you to
   discouragement? Or will you believe in the naked promise?

   Why, if God cannot lie, let us give Him what we would give to a man if
   he were of the same character--our full confidence even in the teeth of
   contradiction--for He is "God, that cannot lie." If a man were
   introduced to us and we were certain that he could not lie, we should
   believe everything he said, however incredible it might appear to us. I
   shall have an appeal to every soul here present. It does seem very
   incredible at first sight that God should take a sinner, full of sin
   and forgive all his iniquities in one moment simply and only upon the
   ground of the sinner believing in Christ! I remember the time when it
   seemed to me utterly impossible that I could ever have my sins
   forgiven.

   I had a clear sense of the value of pardon and this thought would be
   always ringing in my ears--"It is too good to be true that you should
   be pardoned. That you, an enemy, should be made into a child! That you
   who have gone on sinning against light and against knowledge, should
   yet rejoice in union to Christ. The thing is too good to be true!" But,
   beloved Friends, supposing it should seem too good to be true, yet,
   since you have it upon the testimony of One who "cannot lie," I pray
   you believe it.

   "But, Sir." No! None of your "buts"! He cannot lie. "Ah, but." Away
   with your "ahs" and your "buts," for Jehovah cannot lie! He has said
   it, "He that believes and is baptized shall be saved." To believe is to
   trust Christ. If therefore you are trusting Christ, you must be saved.
   And whatever you may be, or whatever you may have done, if you will now
   trust Jesus Christ you have God's Word for it--and He cannot lie--that
   you shall be saved! Come now, will you kick against the promise because
   of its greatness? Do not! Let your doubts and fears be hushed to sleep
   and now, with the promise of God as your pillow and God's faithfulness
   as your support, lie down in peace and behold in faith's open vision
   the ladder, the top of which leads to Heaven!

   Trust the promise of God in Christ and depend upon it that He will be
   as good to you, even to you, as His own Word, and in Heaven you shall
   have to sing of the "God, that cannot lie." I would that these weak
   words of mine, for I am very conscious of their feebleness this
   morning, may nevertheless have comfort in them for any who have been
   doubting and fearing--that they may trust my Lord. And sure I am that
   if they begin a life of faith, they will begin a life of happiness and
   of security! "The just shall live by faith," and well may they do so,
   when they have trust in a "God, that cannot lie."

                      The Arrows Of The Lord'S Deliverance

   DELIVERED ON TUESDAY EVENING, MARCH 22, 1864, BY THE REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE OPENING OF UPTON CHAPEL, LAMBETH.

   "You should have struck five or six times. Then had you struck Syria
   till you had consumed it: whereas now you shall strike Syria but
   thrice.

   2 Kings 13:19.

   THAT deathbed scene speaks volumes for the power of holiness. Elisha
   was the Prophet of God--a man of no honorable station except that he is
   always honorable whom God calls to serve Him. Joash the king of
   Israel--who has often rejected Elisha's admonitions and continued to
   worship in the groves of Baal though Elisha had denounced them and had
   proclaimed that Jehovah, alone, was their God. Now the Prophet is about
   to die at the good old age of ninety and Joash comes to weep at his
   bedside. It was something remarkable for the king to come there at all.
   Kings do not often visit deathbed scenes, especially the deathbeds of
   God's servants!

   But it was something more remarkable for that king to stand and look
   upon the decaying form of the aged Prophet and to weep over his face.
   More notable still was the language in which the king expressed his
   sense of the value of the Prophet to the State--"O my Father, my
   Father, the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof." He felt as if
   now all his strength was cut off. The king had trusted in his cavalry,
   though he had but a slender force, and he compares the Prophet to that
   which he looked upon as being the strongest arm of his military
   service. Or he looks upon the State now as being a chariot with wild
   horses and no stately Prophet to stand erect and hold the reins. Now
   have the reins dropped and where will the chariot go? It will soon be
   overturned and the mad coursers will drag it here and there. So the
   king, out of a sort of selfish respect for the Prophet--for it was
   respect and yet it was selfishness--stands and weeps over Elisha's
   dying bed.

   Dear Friends, let us seek to live so that even ungodly men may miss us
   when we are gone! It is possible for us in a quiet, unobtrusive manner
   to so adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things that when we
   die many shall say, "Let me die the death of the righteous and let my
   last end be like his." And men shall drop a tear and close the shutters
   and be silent and solemn for an hour or two when they hear that the
   servant of the Lord is dead. They laughed at him while he lived, but
   they weep for him when he dies. They could despise him while he was
   here, but now that he is gone they say, "We could have better missed a
   less-known man, for he and such as he, are the pillars of the
   commonweal. They bring down showers of blessing upon us all."

   I would covet this earnestly as a gift, not for the honor and esteem of
   men, but for the honor and glory of God, that even the despisers of
   Christ may be compelled to see that there is a dignity, a respect about
   the walk of an upright man. Yet the scene at the deathbed of Elisha,
   fragrant as it is with the tribute of respect paid to the Prophet by an
   ungodly and unprincipled monarch, is memorable for the lessons then and
   there taught the king. And not less suggestive is it of profitable
   instructions to us. I propose, therefore, first of all to consider the
   significant sign. Then I want you to join with me in censuring the
   slack-handed king. After which we shall have no difficulty, I think, in
   unanimously justifying the righteous wrath of the Prophet.

   I. VERY SIGNIFICANT WAS THE SIGN. Israel was at that time engaged in
   warfare against Syria. As a sign that God intended to give victory to
   His people, the king is bid to take the bow and arrows. Elisha, as
   God's representative, puts his hand upon the king's hands. The window
   is opened and the arrow is shot. As it flies through the air, the
   Prophet says that that arrow is the arrow of the Lord's deliverance of
   His people out of the hand of Syria. The interpretation of this
   symbolic act is simple enough. God will save.

   Deliverance is of the Lord but it must be accomplished by human
   instrumentality. Joash must take the bow and arrows, but the hands of
   Joash cannot make the arrow speed unless Elisha, the representative of
   God, puts his hands there. So the man, Divinely strengthened by God,
   shoots the arrow and the deliverance comes. Such, from the beginning of
   time even until now, has been God's ordinary way of blessing His people
   and of gathering in His chosen. He works. The instrumentality is
   nothing without Him. He takes care to elect means which, from their
   very feebleness, convince the most skeptical that the power cannot be
   in the creature! While, at the same time He rarely effects any great
   thing for His people apart from human agency.

   God, who created all things, is the Agent. But He uses the creatures as
   tools and weapons in the hand of the skillful and the mighty. He works
   in us to will and to do of His own good pleasure. It is His pleasure.
   It is He who works in us. But then it is for us to will and to do,
   because He works in us. Review the whole history of the Church as you
   find it in Scripture and you will see that this has ever been the fact.
   When God would save an elect company out of the mass of corruption
   grown, at last, too fetid for even His patience to endure, He saves the
   chosen eight--how? By a miracle?

   Call it a miracle if you will, but it was mechanical enough when Noah
   begun to lay timber upon timber, fastened them with nails and
   constructed the ark. It was a simple act of faith and a very rational
   act, too, to build a ship! Yet in that ship God's chosen eight were
   preserved. You see the Grace of God and the obedience of Noah. You know
   that the Almighty devised the ark and human hands fashioned it
   according to the pattern He had given.

   Go further on, to a yet more stupendous work of Divine power when God
   brought up His people out of Egypt with a high hand and with an
   outstretched arm. When He led them through the sea as through the
   wilderness and made the depths stand upright as a heap as though they
   were congealed in the heart of the sea. Here was God gloriously
   manifested so that the whole song was unto Jehovah and to Jehovah
   alone--"Sing unto the Lord for He has triumphed gloriously, the horse
   and his rider has He thrown into the sea"!

   Still, still, see you not that calm, meek man, rod outstretched, the
   symbol of abiding human instrumentality in the midst of Jehovah's
   wonders? God divides the sea, not Moses. But God divides not the sea
   without Moses' rod. So, too, when the Rock gave water in the
   wilderness, Moses' voice, and afterwards Moses' rod, must fetch the
   water out of that Rock. And when Jordan was divided, the feet of the
   priests went first down to the river's edge and then--"What ailed you,
   O Jordan, that you were driven back?" Did the priests speak to it? Who
   dreams of such a thing? And yet God did it not without the priests.

   So was it with the capture of the various cities under Joshua. In that
   first and memorable one, the taking of Jericho, they did but little
   when the walls fell flat to the ground on the seventh day. But you will
   remember that those walls did not fall until the people had compassed
   the city the seven days! Nor did they fall without the sound of the
   rams' horns and the shouts of the multitude. So again, turn to the time
   of the Judges and how did God deliver His people then? Why, my Friends,
   you find at one time it is the ox-goad of Shamgar, and at another time
   it is the jawbone in the hand of Samson! Sometimes it is Gideon's lamp
   and pitcher and then it is Jephthah's good and true sword.

   Ever is it true that God has means, selecting for His purposes things
   of earth to execute the fiats of Heaven. But I might, perhaps, weary
   you with mentioning the history of the kings and running on through the
   Prophets. Therefore let us come at once to Apostolic times. Old Rome
   was to be subdued. The deep-seated idolatries of ages were to be rooted
   up and the fabulous deities were to be shaken from their pedestals. The
   Spirit of the Lord could do it in a moment--He might have convinced all
   men of the folly of idolatry--silently breathing upon human minds they
   might have been convicted of sin and turned to the great Father of
   Spirits.

   A Revelation of Christ might have been given to every man without a
   single minister. But did He choose to do it? No, my Brethren, He did
   not. The twelve fishermen must first proclaim the Word and afterwards
   such men as Timothy and those who were the true "successors of the
   Apostles," must in every region preach the Words of Truth. Or, point me
   to a single period in the history of the Church where God has worked
   without instrumentality and I will tell you that I suspect whether God
   has worked at all if I do not see the instruments He has employed.

   Take the Reformation. Can you think of it without thinking of God? At
   the same time can you mention it without the names of Luther, and
   Calvin, Zwingle and Melancthon? Then in the later Reformation in
   England, when our slumbering Churches were suddenly started from their
   sleep--who did it? The Holy Spirit Himself--but you cannot talk of the
   revival without mentioning the names of Whitfield and Wesley--for God
   worked by means then, and He works by means still.

   I used to notice a remark which was made concerning the revival in the
   north of Ireland, that there seemed to be no prominent instrumentality.
   The moment I saw that, I mistrusted it. Had it been God's work more
   fully developed through instrumentality, I believe it had not so
   speedily come to a close. We grant you that God can work without means
   and even when He uses means He still takes the Glory to Himself, for it
   is all His own. Yet it has been the rule, and will be the rule till the
   day of means shall come to an end, that just as God saved man by taking
   upon Himself man's flesh, so everywhere in the world He calls men by
   speaking to them through men of their own flesh and blood.

   God Incarnates Himself--if I may use so strong an expression in a
   restricted sense--in His Spirit Incarnates Himself in the chosen men,
   especially in His Church, in which He dwells as in a temple. And then
   through that Church He is pleased to bless the world. Now we must hold
   this forever. We are not to let the arrows lie still and say, "God will
   do His own work. Elisha will shoot the arrows." This is idleness. We
   have had enough of this! Look at those Churches which say, "God will do
   His own work." You will find that the more these people talk about
   God's doing His own work, the more they sink into a fatal apathy.

   No Sunday school. No care for the conversion of souls. Just bigotry,
   bitterness of spirit, carping and backbiting against all those who are
   willing to labor in the Master's vineyard. And when they have entangled
   Brethren whose conversion was effected under other ministries than
   their own, they talk as if they had been re-converted and did not know
   the Truth of God till they heard the particular, excellent, superfine,
   hot pressed Gospel which they deliver! There is all that sort of thing
   among them. You see a spirit the reverse of amiable. A mind palpably
   contrary to that which was in Jesus Christ.

   On the other hand, it is an equally dangerous error to suppose that we
   are to take the arrows and shoot without God. This is, in fact, the
   more dangerous of the two. Although, if I have to compare two devils
   together, I know not which is the worst of these evil spirits--the
   spirit that idly says--"Leave it to God"--or the spirit which goes
   about God's work without depending on Him. O Lord of Hosts, it is not
   by might, nor by power, but by Your Spirit! Nevertheless the love of
   Christ constrains us to spend and be spent in His cause.

   II. And now, secondly, let us CENSURE THE SLACK-HANDED KING. The
   Prophet gave him the bow and the arrows and bade him shoot down upon
   the ground. It was left to him. God foreknew and had predestinated how
   many victories he should win. But still, at the same time, it is
   marvelous how our free actions tally exactly with God's predestination!
   He is bid to shoot and he shoots once. He draws his bow and shoots
   again. A third time he draws the bow and then throws it down slack upon
   the ground.

   The Prophet is angry with him for he will only have three victories. If
   he had struck the ground six times he would have had six victories. But
   inasmuch as he only shot the three times, he is only to have three
   triumphs. The king is to be censured and censured severely. But as he
   is dead and gone and our censure cannot much affect him, let us censure
   those who now imitate him. And we think that we can find very many of
   the same sort!

   How many Believers have but little faith and seem quite content to have
   but that little? They cannot grasp the promise of God and believingly
   expect to have it fulfilled. They scarcely know their own interest in
   Christ. They are safe enough, but they are generally wretched enough.
   They cannot take God at His Word and therefore their temporal troubles
   and their spiritual cares press very heavily upon them. Oh that they
   had Grace to strike the ground six times! Oh that they knew how to cast
   all their burdens on Him who cares for them! Oh that the Lord would
   give them new faith so that they would trust Him implicitly and leave
   their souls in the hands of Him who shed His heart's blood that He
   might redeem them from wrath!

   Why, I do not know, dear Friends, that there is any necessity for us to
   be always doubting and fearing and trembling! Some think there is. But
   this is because they have not a high idea of the standing of the child
   of God and of the position which God would have him attain. They shoot
   the three arrows and they say--"I am saved, that is enough. I shall get
   to Heaven." Oh that they would go on shooting till they could get a
   Heaven below, till they could begin by strong faith to--

   "Read their title clear, To mansions in the sky," and rejoice with joy
   unspeakable and full of glory!

   Then you see another class of people who are just the same as to their
   knowledge. They do not understand the deep things of God. They are
   content to know that which saves the soul from ruin and the remedy
   which is provided in Christ, but they do not know, and perhaps do not
   care to know, the doctrine of God's electing love. They never dive into
   the doctrine of God's immutable faithfulness to His chosen people. They
   let the deep things of God lie still for strong men, but they,
   themselves, are content to be babes.

   Oh, dear Friends, how much you miss who neglect to study God's Word.
   And what blessings do you cast away from yourselves who are willing to
   be ignorant of the most sublime Truths of Revelation! I would that
   instead of shooting three times, you would have Grace to shoot more and
   more and more till you comprehend with all saints what are the heights
   and depths and lengths and breadths of the love of Christ which passes
   knowledge. You will see, perhaps, these same people, or others like
   them, who are very content about their daily walk and conversation.
   They are not drunkards. They do not swear. They are scrupulously
   truthful. They commit no breach of Sunday--but when you have said this,
   you have said about as much as you can say of them.

   Their religion seems to have made them moral, but it would be difficult
   to perceive that it has made them holy. There is very little family
   prayer--not much interest taken in the conversion of the children.
   There is an angry temper, perhaps, which is somewhat curbed but still
   the Brother thinks that it is impossible to curb it any more and so he
   tolerates himself in the occasional indulgence of it. There is much
   which is not inconsistent, perhaps, in the eye of the world, but which
   is most certainly not consistent in the mind of the Spirit of God.
   These Brethren have, in fact, shot three times and they have struck the
   ground once or twice, but they have not made a clean sweep of their
   besetting sins. They still tolerate some of them. They have not reached
   to a high point of holiness.

   Now I am as far as anybody from believing that a man ever will be
   perfect in this life, but I will never be satisfied till I am! And if I
   cannot be perfect, I will seek, by God's Grace, to get as near to it as
   possible. And this should be the labor of every Christian. Not in order
   to save himself, but because he is saved he should labor after the very
   highest degrees of holiness and seek that God might shine through him
   as through a lamp and that men may take knowledge of him that he has
   been with Jesus and learned of Him. High faith, high knowledge, high
   living--oh what blessed Christians should we have if these three went
   together!

   So, too, there are many Christians who do not shoot more than three
   times, inasmuch as they are content with very low enjoyments. Oh the
   many, the many professors who all their days are subject to bondage!
   Now Christ came to deliver such from the fear of death. And yet though
   Christ came to do it, it is not done in their case. They do not receive
   the Spirit of Adoption, but they seem to have received the spirit of
   bondage again to fear, and they think that this is the rule with God's
   people. When they read of some saints who have climbed the mountains
   and have had sweet fellowship with Christ, they say, "Ah, such men are
   uncommon and such experiences are like angels' visits, few and far
   between. We cannot get up to this."

   I do believe, dear Friends, that this spirit creeps over us all. We
   read the biography of such a man as Brainerd and we shut up the book
   and sigh and say, "Oh I could never be so devoted as he was!" We have
   turned over the life of Whitfield and when we have read it, we have
   said, "Ah, a very extraordinary man--a very extraordinary man! It is
   not likely that I shall ever get his zeal." And when we turn to the Old
   Testament and read of Abraham, we say, "Yes, Abraham's faith was very
   wonderful. But we do not look upon him as a pattern which we are to
   imitate--we believe that his faith is something set up high in a
   niche--to which we can never get."

   My Brethren, this is all wrong! I believe that the Christian man ought
   not to be content to be equal with Abraham, because Abraham lived in
   the dark, before the Sun had risen. It was, at least, but twilight in
   Abraham's day. And yet if he had so much faith when he could only see
   through the dim smoke of sacrificial rams and bulls, how much more
   faith and confidence in God ought you and I to have when we see Christ
   Himself, and when God speaks to us through His Son? Shame on us that we
   are content to be such dwarfs when we might grow into giants--that we
   are here frittering away our time when we might immortalize ourselves
   and glorify our Lord.

   How is it that we are content to bring forth a lean ear, and then a
   scanty ear, when there should be seven ears upon one stalk, like the
   plenty of Egypt? How is it that we have here and there a cluster, when
   instead, if we did but shoot more, if we had more faith and more
   confidence in God, we might be like the grapes of Eshcol, whose
   clusters were too heavy for one man to carry? Yes, I am afraid there is
   in this Christian land very, very much of this stopping short of what
   we might be. We do not press on and reach to that which is before, but
   saying, "I am saved," we are content and sit down before we reach the
   goal, or have apprehended that for which we were apprehended of Christ
   Jesus.

   Now I want your attention for just a moment while I try to show some of
   the reasons why the king did not shoot more. I cannot tell certainly,
   but I think some of the reasons which I am going to give you may be
   correct. Perhaps he felt rather tender towards the Syrians. It is just
   possible that he felt he did not want to hurt them too much. He would
   be victorious--he would get his enemy under his feet. But if he did
   more he would crush him outright and he hardly wanted to do that.

   So I think that some professors do not want to be too hard with their
   sins--they have a sort of hidden tenderness towards their own
   corruptions. O, dear Friends, how very angry we get when somebody tells
   us a little too plainly about our faults! And how angry we are with
   anything which seeks to cut the throat of our favorite sin! Ah, we do
   not know how tender we are to our sins, any of us, whereas the viper's
   brood should be crushed in the nest! We are often saying as we wound
   them, "Yes, keep them under. But no--I could not give them all up--I
   could not--no, I must have just a little indulgence. There must be this
   and that."

   The laying of the axe to the root of the tree is not pleasant work. Lop
   the big boughs off if you like, but laying the axe to the root--no, we
   do not quite like that. There is in us, after all, through our natural
   corruptions, a hankering attachment to our sins. The old man says,
   "Spare them," and it needs much Grace and triumphant Grace, too, to
   say, "No! Hew them to pieces before the Lord and let not even the best
   of the sheep or of the cattle be spared." Tenderness to sin will always
   check us in any great growth in Grace. We shall not use God's bow as
   much as we should if we once begin to pamper self-indulgence, to
   cultivate our own ease and make provision for the flesh.

   Again, perhaps the king did not go on to shoot because he thought it
   was hardly his business to be employed as a bowman. "Why should I stay
   here forever," says he, "shooting arrows? I did not object when the
   Prophet's hand was upon me, to shoot. But to stand here and keep
   striking the ground is hardly the occupation for a king!" And then the
   thought, perhaps, that he should have three victories and that would be
   enough. "Why, it will be something wonderful! Three victories, one
   after another, will be quite enough to crown me with everlasting renown
   and I do not want more than that." And so he did shoot but three times.

   And how many a Believer seems to say, "Can I always be keeping watch
   over my corruptions? Am I to be so precise and to live so near to God?
   What? Am I to be so much in prayer? Am I to be such a Bible student,
   and to be so much occupied? No, if I can overcome some of my sins and
   be a respectable Church member and do a little in the Sunday school,
   and get to Heaven--that is enough." You do not want, you see, to be
   made good. You do not want to be made Christlike. You do not want to be
   able to triumph over your sins. You mistake your high calling--you
   think you are called to be a slave, when you are called to reign! You
   fancy that you are called to wear sackcloth, when you are bid to put on
   scarlet and fine linen! You think that God has called you to a
   dunghill, whereas He has called you to a throne! You imagine that you
   are to be but here and there--the skirmishers in the battle--when He
   has called you to stand in the front rank and to fight constantly for
   His cause.

   I think, also, that the king may have begun to doubt whether the
   victories would really come. He knew very well that he had not many
   soldiers and that Syria was very strong, so he thought, "Well, it takes
   some faith to think that I shall beat them three times, but it is not
   likely I shall do it the fourth." He doubted the Divine power and the
   Divine promise because of his own weakness. And many a Christian does
   that. I think, Brethren, that we who are in the ministry might do
   vastly more for God than we do, if, remembering our own weakness, we
   did not let that overshadow God's strength.

   Why, what cannot a man do when he has faith in God? Without Christ we
   can do nothing. But remember the converse of that proposition--that
   with Him we can do all things. If He will be with me I can do all
   things, or can bear all sufferings. Let us not forget this. And never
   let a sense of human weakness mar our clear perception of the might and
   majesty of God. Let us shoot often, for as often as we shoot, God will
   answer our faith.

   And do you not think, too, that it is very likely that the king
   despised the Prophet's plans? Why, he seemed to say, this was absurd,
   striking the ground in this way! If there were any men to be shot at,
   he would not spare the arrows. But to strike the ground in this
   way--absurd! Ridiculous! So, too often, we miss a blessing because we
   do not like God's plans. We have got some new scheme of our own. It is
   not preaching the Gospel--that is old-fashioned. We will try something
   else. It is better than going out into the highways and hedges and
   compelling them to come in. No, we want a shorter cut than that! We
   keep fancying that if we were to give up some ordinance--perhaps if we
   held our tongues about Baptism--or if we were to cut about this
   doctrine and that, we should get on better.

   Ah, this is all wrong, dear Friends. Carnal policy may take its place
   in the cabinet and in the government of the land, but never in the
   House of God! If right is right, pursue it. If God commands it, do it
   and leave the consequences to Him! If He bids you shoot on the ground,
   you shoot on the ground. You may see no Assyrian there. But every time
   you shoot, that arrow finds the heart of your enemy and shall lay him
   low.

   I would, dear Friends, that I could so speak tonight as to give the
   members of this Church a very high and noble ambition to do much and to
   get much for God--to get much Grace--to have much holiness--to do much
   work. In fact, I wish I could bring you into such a state of heart as
   the Prophet wished to see in Joash--that you would take the arrows and
   shoot them off.

   III. THE RIGHTEOUS WRATH OF THE PROPHET is our third point. And we
   think WE CAN WELL JUSTIFY HIS ANGER. We do not like to see either an
   old man, or a dying man angry. But I think the Prophet here did well to
   be angry, even though at the hour of his death. Oh how he loved the
   people and how he wept to think that their king was standing in their
   light and was robbing them of precious privileges!

   Now when I look, dear Friends, upon many Church members and see how
   utterly idle and careless they are about Christ's cause and how many
   professors seem to be as dead as the seats they sit upon and to have no
   more Grace than worldlings, I think if my soul were warmed with
   something like a holy passion against them, I might say, with more
   truth than Jonah, "I do well to be angry." How much Israel suffers from
   the slack-handedness of the king! Oh, Christians, you suffer
   yourselves! You miss a thousand comforts! What you might do for God you
   are unable to do! What you might sit down and feed upon yourselves you
   utterly miss because you will not go on farther and seek higher
   attainments!

   And all your Brethren suffer, too. Your prayers at the Prayer Meeting
   have not that fervor and unction which they would have if you lived
   nearer to God. Your experience is not so profitable to them as it would
   be if you walked nearer to Christ. The whole Church treasury is robbed
   by you. Church membership is a sort of joint-stock company. We, each
   one of us, take out of that stock and put into it. There is a prayer
   treasury--we all want to be prayed for. There is taking out of it. We
   must all put prayers into the treasury and those members who do not
   pray--and are there such? And those members who do not yearn over
   souls--and are there not such? Those members who have no zeal for
   God--and are there such?--rob the treasury of God! And I know not why I
   might not compare them to Ananias and Sapphira, for they keep back a
   part of the price. God have mercy upon them for this!

   The Church has greatly suffered on this account. Why, if this king had
   shot more arrows, Syria would have been quite overcome and cut in
   pieces. But because he was slack in this, Syria waves her proud banner
   over captive maids and sorrowing widows whose husbands have been slain
   in battle and weep in the streets of Samaria. The devil rejoices when
   he sees slumbering Christians! The world laughs in its sleeve at
   professors nowadays because it says, "In the old Puritan times, when we
   saw a Christian we were afraid of him. Ah, when a man joined the Church
   in those days, he was a man who meant what he said. But ah, there are
   so many of them now who only join the Church to be respectable. And
   they only go to a place of worship because of custom that the people
   may trade with them and be cheated--that they may talk with them and
   hear such idle talk as they would not hear from men in the streets, who
   never profess anything! Ah, we have almost overcome and destroyed the
   Church when we see her members behaving so."

   It is these people, who may be Christians, but who are only half
   Christians. These people who are not altogether cold, but who still are
   not hot. These people whom I would not shovel away with the dross, but
   who nevertheless are so adulterated with base metal that you can
   scarcely call them pure gold. It is these people who make the daughter
   of Philis-tia to rejoice and the sons of the adversary to triumph. How
   Jehovah's name was dishonored! In Assyria's streets they laughed at
   Jehovah. They said that their gods were greater than He. Oh what a
   shame it is that you and I should ever put Christ to more shame than He
   endured for our sakes!

   My Brothers and Sisters, what do we think of ourselves if we have ever
   in any measure crucified the Lord afresh and put Him to open shame? It
   is not only inconsistent Christians who do this but those Christians
   who do not seek to come up to the standard--who are contented to be
   poor in Grace when they might be rich. I believe that such persons
   bring much dishonor to Christ by their doubting, by their hard thoughts
   of Christ, by their miserable countenances and often, too, by their
   want of zeal, their want of prayer and their shallowness in the ways of
   God.

   Look abroad and see how busy men are in the world! When a man wants to
   make money, see how he rises early and sits up late and eats the bread
   of carefulness! It is wonderful what ingenuity men put forth to get a
   fortune, what desper- ate attempts they make! How they will go to India
   and sweat under the burning sky and brave the fever there. Why, there
   are thousands of England's sons who do this year by year. See how at
   the North Pole bold and brave men have sacrificed their lives to force
   a passage. Men have been willing, in scientific experiments, to
   sacrifice social comforts, risk their health and forfeit their lives!

   It seems to me that everybody is enthusiastic except Christians, and
   that men can get their blood hot on any subject except religion! In
   these days the ice has been given to the Church of God and the fire has
   been cast upon the world. Look at the devil's advocates, how they
   compass sea and land to make one proselyte. If you are dead and dull,
   they will not be so here at your next-door neighbors--St. George's
   Cathedral! You may be careless about the poor, but they will not be!
   You may, perhaps, cease to be much in prayer and much in action, but
   you will find that they will not cease their incantations!

   Why, when the devil comes to a man he will say to him, "Come with me! I
   want you to leave your wife and children tonight! Come with me," and
   away the man goes to some low pot-house. "I want you to go in here,"
   says the devil, and the man goes in--perhaps a respectable man, as the
   world has it. "Now," says the devil, "I want you to drink ale and
   stout. It will make your brain reel. It will make your eyes red
   tomorrow morning and perhaps send you into delirium tremors." "I will
   do it," says the man and he drinks it pleasantly and sweetly as though
   he were drinking draughts of Heaven's own nectar.

   It may be that he goes reeling home, or has to be carried there, but he
   is quite ready to go again and again, though he may beggar his children
   and see his weeping wife and his starving family. He does it all so
   cheerfully and thinks, in fact, that he is a very fine fellow and is
   only enjoying himself, though he brings untold miseries unto his
   family. You will sometimes see a man go into vice and bring his own
   body to the verge of the grave and make himself a mass of rottenness at
   the command of the devil and yet he never grumbles at his master, never
   thinks of running away from him!

   And here is my Lord, whose service is perfect freedom, who gives us to
   eat and to drink of better food than angels ever tasted! Who the more
   we do for Him the more He rewards us and the more strength He gives us
   to work with. And yet we are cold and dull and dead! And if we are
   asked to do something, we say we have so many calls. Or if we are asked
   to go upon some enterprise which has a little dishonor or discomfort
   connected with it, we go back--would lie in bed and take our ease! Oh
   what a shame, what a shame this is!

   Prophet, you did well to be angry! I would that some burning spirits
   would come among us and speak even bitterly to us, if they could but
   make us feel that--

   "Life is real, life is earnest," and that the cause of Christ demands
   that spirit, soul and body should be at the highest tension, at the
   very sternest stretch, spending and being spent, even unto
   blood--resisting sin and contending for the mastery of Christ!

   Well now, I took this text because it seemed to me--I do not know how
   it seems to you--as if it were a lesson to your minister and to you
   tonight. Here you are, come into this new Chapel and into a
   neighborhood new to you. We who are come here from other Churches, as
   the old Prayer Book version puts it, "Wish you good luck in the name of
   the Lord." We wish for you the highest and the best prosperity that we
   desire for ourselves. But we do want to impress upon you that while God
   will help you and stand by you, always remember that the Church must be
   active.

   Every single individual must take his portion in this sacred fight, in
   this grand crusade against sin. I pray Brother Evans never to stay his
   hand from the shooting of the arrows. If God shall bless him in one
   effort, let him go on to another. If he sees seven souls converted, let
   him mourn that it is not eight. If he sees the place filled, let him,
   even then, not rest satisfied but let his cry still be for something
   beyond. And, as the eagle rests not, but flies upward, ever facing the
   sun, such may his course be--onward and upward and true to the
   line--until the Master shall take him into His Glory in the rest which
   remains for the people of God.

   And you who are here, do you sit still? Do not say, "Well, if we get
   these seats comfortably filled we shall be content." I hope you may
   have them filled, but I hope you will not, then be content! No, let it
   be your aim, then, to pray that God will convert the seat-holders, that
   the congregation shall become the Church. And do not be content, then!
   Ask that the aisles may be filled, that God will convert the standers
   and that your Church may burst the walls of the house in which you
   meet. Do not think that your standard of a Prayer Meeting is to be a
   low one. Do not begin to say, "If we have twenty or thirty at a Prayer
   Meeting that will do."

   Why, many of our Churches are below even that standard! Do not be
   content even with fifty, but go on shooting. Yes, Brother Evans, go on.
   And you members of this Church--go on shooting your arrows! Do not ask
   God for a little, but open your mouth wide and God will fill it! Take
   care that you open it as wide as ever you can. Ask Him for great things
   and when you ask do not ask as though you thought you were very
   venturesome. No, but ask because He is sure to give! Believe that God
   can and will give you a gracious justification for believing in Him.
   Ask, too, because He knows what your hearts cannot even conceive of,
   for He is able to do exceeding abundantly beyond what you can ask!

   Do not be content, I pray you, at Upton Chapel, with being a nice,
   respectable, strong Church in the denomination! Do not be content with
   that! I say it very sorrowfully, but we have known some Churches which
   did run well. They have got a good place of worship, a very handsome
   building with little bits of colored glass and the people's faces on
   Sundays are all sorts of colors. And when they have got to this pitch
   they have said, "Well, we are very respectable people. We do not want
   the poor people. We do not want to go into the lanes and highways and
   hedges and fetch them in." In fact, they get sometimes to be like some
   of your old servants--you hardly know which is master and which is
   servant. And so the Lord may hardly know which is master in the
   Church--these people, or Himself--for they will not do what He tells
   them. They have got too big for that. They could do it once, but they
   cannot do it now.

   Now that will not be the case here for years to come. I hope it may
   never be the case here. But may you ever be a faithful Church! May you
   ever be a working Church till the Lord Himself shall come. May God
   grant that you may keep on shooting your arrows, that you may expect
   great things and do great things. And now, you members of the Church
   and all of us who are here present, let us consecrate ourselves anew
   unto God. Let us ask ourselves tonight whether we have not been
   shooting too few arrows. Whether we have not thought too much of the
   little we have been doing. Whether we might not have done more. Whether
   we must not do more. Whether now, for the future, we will not believe
   God's promises more firmly. Preach His Word more boldly. Tell it to
   others more frequently. Give to God more liberally. Pray to God more
   earnestly, consecrate and devote ourselves to the Lord more perfectly.

   I am sure there is room for great improvement in the best of us. O
   Lord, what a spark is my love to You! Oh that You would blow it into a
   flame, till it were as coals ofjuniper! To use the words of an old
   minister--"David said, 'The zeal of Your house has eaten me up,' but it
   will be a long time before some people are eaten up. It has not begun
   to nibble at them yet and there is no fear of their being eaten up."

   Now I would like to see a man "eaten up" with his religion! I would
   that the Christian would give himself up so completely to the mighty
   whirlwind of Divine Grace that it might carry him away and make him but
   as a particle of straw in its tremendous course! The Lord grant you
   power and Grace thus to be given up to Him and thus to serve Him! May
   God now add His own blessing, for Christ Jesus' sake. Amen.

                            The First Five Disciples

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, MAY 15, 1864, BY THE REV. C. H. SPURGEON,
   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And the two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus. Then
   Jesus turned and saw them following and said unto them, What do you
   seek? They said unto Him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted,
   Master), where do You dwell? He said unto them, Come and see. They came
   and saw where He dwelt and abode with Him that day for it was about the
   tenth hour. One of the two which heard John speak and followed Him was
   Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. He first found his own brother, Simon,
   and said unto him, We have found the Messiah, (which is, being
   interpreted, the Christ). And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus
   beheld him, He said, You are Simon the son of Jona: you shall be called
   Cephas, (which is by interpretation, A Stone). The day following Jesus
   would go forth into Galilee and find Philip and say unto him, Follow
   Me. Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. Philip
   found Nathanael and said unto him, We have found Him, of whom Moses in
   the Law and the Prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of
   Joseph. And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out
   of Nazareth? Philip said unto him, Come and see. Jesus saw Nathanael
   coming to Him and said of him, Behold an Israelite, indeed, in whom is
   no guile. Nathanael said unto Him, Why do You know me? Jesus answered
   and said unto him, Before that Philip called you, when you were under
   the fig tree, Isaw you. Nathanael answered and said unto Him, Rabbi,
   You are the Son of God, You are the King of Israel. Jesus answered and
   said unto him, Because I said unto you, Isaw you under the fig tree, do
   you believe? You shall see greater things than these, And He said unto
   him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter you shall see Hea ven
   open and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of
   Man." John 1:37-51.

   IF it is true that "Order is Heaven's first law," I think it must be
   equally true that variety is the second law of Heaven. The line of
   beauty is not a straight line but always the curve. The way of God's
   procedure is not uniform but diversified. You see this with a glance,
   when you look at the creation around us. God has not made all creatures
   of one species but He has created beasts, birds, fishes, insects,
   reptiles. All flesh truly is not the same flesh, neither are all bodies
   of the same order. The dull dead earth, itself, is full of variety.
   Gems sparkle not all with the same ray. The grosser and less precious
   rocks are marked and veined. Each one according to its own fashion. In
   the vegetable world what a variety of plants, shrubs, herbs, flowers
   and trees we have about us! In any one of the kingdoms of Nature,
   whether it is the animal, vegetable, or mineral, you shall find so many
   subdivisions that it would need a long schooling to classify them and a
   lifetime would not suffice to understand them all.

   Consider the winged creatures which flit through the air--what a
   diversity there is between the tiny humming bird, which seems to be but
   a living mass of gems, and the eagle which, with soaring wings ascends
   to the sky and sports with the lighting! The whole world is full of
   marvels and no two marvels alike. You shall never be able to find God
   repeating Himself. This great Master may often paint two pictures which
   seem alike, but investigated with the microscope, what differences at
   once are revealed!

   Even those stars which seem to shine with rays of the same brilliance
   are discovered by the aid of the telescope to be of different colors,
   forms and orbits. No, even the very clouds are piled in varied forms
   and the masses of nebulae which make up the Milky Way are
   distinguishable from each other. God, in no instance that we can ever
   find, has used the same mold a second time. He is so affluent of
   designs, so abundant in the wisdom that devises, so prolific in plans
   that even when He would accomplish the same end He chooses to take
   another road to it. And that new road is quite as direct as those by
   which He has formerly reached His purpose.

   Certainly this observation holds good in Providence. What strange
   diversity there has been in the dealings of God with His Church! When
   He has chastened His people He has scarcely ever made use of the same
   rod twice. At one time Midianites shall come up and devour the land of
   Israel. Another day the Philistines with their giants shall invade the
   country. Then shall come the Babylonians and the Assyrians. Later the
   Roman power shall tread Judea under foot. And as the rods of His
   chastisement have been always different on the great scale, so you have
   found it on the little scale.

   God has seldom chastened you twice in the same way. You could trace
   diversities either in the manner of the blow or the instrument you were
   struck with, or in the part of your mind which seemed to be the most
   affected by His chastisements. In deliverers, again, how great a
   variety--you scarce find two alike! God raises up a Gideon, but
   Jephthah is not like Gideon and Samson is not like Jephthah, nor is
   David to be compared to Samson or Gideon. They are all diverse. And
   their weapons are varied, too. One man has to use an ass' jawbone,
   another must use a sling and a stone--one shall be content with the ox
   goad, while another must draw the dagger.

   Different methods God ordains as well as different forms of man. And He
   delivers His people just according to His own will, but ever in a
   different form. Well may Providence be so diverse when you consider
   that men themselves whom God uses to be His principal instruments are
   so unlike each other. There are not merely the great differences of
   race and of nationality, nor even the differences of birth and
   education, but we are all different in constitution--no two minds being
   alike. There is an individuality about every one of us which will
   prevent our ever being mistaken for anyone else.

   We might by accident be undistinguished, but let us be known and very
   soon important differences will be discovered. God is ever the God of
   variety and He will be so to the end of the chapter. He will do new
   things before He rolls up the book of history--we shall see new acts of
   the Lord--He will fight His battles after fresh methods, raise up
   deliverers different from any who have come before and will exalt and
   glorify His name upon new instruments of music. Let us expect it. He is
   the God of variety, both in Nature and in Providence.

   My text is a very clear illustration that the same law applies in the
   work of Grace. There is ever the same kind of operation and yet ever a
   difference in the manner of operation. There is always the same Worker
   in the conversion of the soul and yet different methods for breaking
   the heart and binding it up again are continually employed. Every
   sinner must be quickened by the same life, made obedient to the same
   Gospel, washed in the same blood, clothed in the same righteousness,
   filled with the same Divine energy and eventually taken up to the same
   Heaven. And yet in the conversion of no two sinners will you find
   matters precisely the same.

   From the first dawn of the Divine life to the day when it is
   consummated in the noontide of perfect sanctification in Heaven, you
   shall find that God works this way in that one, and that way in the
   other, and by another method in the third--for God still will be the
   God of variety. Let His order stand fast as it may, still will He ever
   be manifesting the variety, the many-sidedness of His thoughts and
   mind. If, then, you look at this narrative--somewhat long, but I think
   very full of instruction--you may notice four different methods of
   conversion. And these occur in the conversion of the first five who
   formed the nucleus of the college of Apostles--the first five who came
   to Christ and were numbered among His disciples!

   It is very remarkable that there should be among five individuals four
   different ways of conversion! Were you, however, to examine any five
   persons, I suppose you would find similar disparity. Pick out five
   Christians indiscriminately and begin to question them how they were
   brought to know the Lord. You will find methods other than those you
   have here. And probably quite as many as four out of the five would be
   distinct from the rest.

   I. The first case we have in the text is THE CONVERSION OF THE TWO
   DISCIPLES. One was probably John. We cannot speak with absolute
   certainty, but it was very probably John. We know it to have been the
   habit of this Evangelist to omit his own name whenever he could.
   Sometimes he speaks of "that other disciple," when he means himself.
   And now and then he puts it, "that disciple whom Jesus loved."

   His love nurtured in him a kindly esteem of others, but an humble
   estimate of himself. While, therefore, he never omits to record the
   need of praise others obtained from the lips of Christ, as often as he
   can he omits his own name. It is supposed then--and I think
   rightly--that one was John. The other was Andrew, Simon Peter's
   brother. The first two disciples are the fruits ofpreaching.

   May we not expect to find that the major part of our conversions are
   the result of the public ministry? "The two disciples heard him speak
   and they followed Jesus." Let us offer a few words concerning this
   first matter. We expect, Beloved, to see a great number of souls
   brought to God by the preaching of the Truth of God. The preaching of
   the Cross may be and it actually is to those who perish, foolishness.
   But unto us who are saved, it is the power of God and the wisdom of
   God. Wherever there is the most Gospel preaching, you will find the
   most conversions.

   Many of our societies for carrying the Gospel to the heathen forget
   their main work. And while setting up colleges, translating Bibles and
   publishing tracts, they neglect to use this great hammer of God, this
   mighty battering ram which is to dash down strongholds. The preaching
   of the Cross, the crying of, "Behold the Lamb of God!"--this is God's
   appointed agency. Other labors are to be entered into, but this is the
   main and chief agency for the conversion of souls.

   Observe in the case before us, the preacher. He was a man Divinely
   illuminated. Jesus Christ came to John's Baptism, but at first the
   Baptist did not know Him. After awhile, however, when the descending
   Spirit marked out the Messiah, John then knew to a certainty that this
   was He of whom Moses in the Law and the Prophets did write. Ever
   afterwards John's testimony was clear and bold. Though he ended his
   ministry with the loss of his head, he never lost the honesty of his
   purpose or the lucidness of his testimony. He continued faithfully to
   declare that the Messiah had come.

   Brethren, it is of importance in the work of the ministry that the
   preacher be a God-illuminated man. Not that education is to be
   despised--on the contrary, we cannot expect the Spirit of God in these
   days to give to men the knowledge of languages if they can acquire that
   knowledge by a little perseverance. It is never the Divine rule to work
   a superfluous miracle. With the faculties and powers we possess, we
   must yield up our members unto God as instruments of righteousness. So
   far, then, as the education of the man is concerned, we believe God
   leaves that with us, for if we can do it there is no need that any
   miracle should be worked.

   But let the man be educated ever so well, he is then but as the lump of
   clay--God must breathe into his nostrils the breath of spiritual life
   as a preacher, or else he will be of no service--just a dead weight
   upon the Church of God. What shall we say, then, of those men who enter
   into a pulpit because the family living is vacant, or because, indeed,
   being too great fools for either the army or the law, they must needs
   be put where their livelihood can be more easily obtained--in the
   Church? How crying is this sin in our times, that men should have
   Episcopal hands laid upon them, declaring that they are moved to the
   ministry by the Holy Spirit, when they know not whether there is a Holy
   Spirit, so far as any experimental knowledge of His power upon their
   own hearts is concerned!

   The day, I hope, is passing away when men shall be more skilled at
   hunting the fox than at fishing for souls. And on the whole, God is
   raising up in this land a spirit of decision upon this point--that the
   Christian minister must be a man who knows experimentally in his own
   soul the Truths of God which he professes to preach. God may convert
   souls, it is true, by a bad preacher. Why, if the devil preached, I
   should not wonder at souls being converted--if only the devil preached
   the Truth. It is the Truth and not the preacher. Ravens, unclean birds
   though they are, brought Elijah his bread and his meat--and unclean
   ministers may sometimes bring God's servants their spiritual food. But
   for all that, unto the wicked, God says, "What have you to do to
   declare My statutes?" The minister must be a God-taught man whose eyes
   have been opened by the Holy Spirit. This, at least, is the standing
   rule--whatever exceptions may be pleaded.

   Then, mark you, granted that this is the case we must not expect his
   ministry to be alike successful at all times, for in the present
   instance, on one occasion the Baptist gave a very clear testimony for
   Christ, but none of his disciples left him to follow Jesus. The next
   time he preached he was successful, for two of his disciples joined the
   Master, though on the former occasion we read not that one of his
   hearers was led to declare himself on the Lord's side.

   My Brethren, God suffers His ministers to cast the net sometimes on the
   wrong side of the ship. Even a whole night they may toil and take
   nothing. They may sow upon the barren ground, upon the highway and
   among the thorns. They may cast their bread upon the waters, and as yet
   they may not find it, for the promise speaks of "many days." Still the
   minister must persevere. If souls are not saved today, they may be
   tomorrow. I was wondering, as I read this passage, whether there were
   some who heard last Sunday in vain, who perhaps would hear to profit
   today. I was lifting up my heart in prayer to God that these words,
   "the next day after," might come true to some here.

   Whereas, the other day, I cried, "Behold the Lamb!" and you did not see
   Him or trust Him, I will repeat the cry, "Behold the Lamb!" again
   today. O that you may be led to follow Jesus! When you have well
   considered the preacher and his success, I would have you observe his
   Subject. How short the sermon!--a rebuke to our prolixity. How plain it
   was-- no difficult phrases--no high-flown elocutionary
   embellishments--no feats of oratory here! It is just, "Behold the
   Lamb!" But observe the Subject--John preaches of Jesus Christ, of
   nothing else but Christ. And of Christ, too, in that position and in
   that form in which He was most needed but least palatable.

   The Jews accepted Christ the Lion. They looked for the mighty Hero of
   the Tribe of Judah who should break their bonds. Such Jesus was. But
   John did not preach Him as such. He preached Him as Christ the
   Lamb--the Lamb of God, the suffering, despised, meek, and patient
   Sacrifice. The Baptist held Him up to the sons of men on this occasion
   as the great Sin Bearer. He seems to have brought out most prominently
   in his own thoughts and before the minds of the people the picture of
   the paschal lamb and of the scapegoat. He dwelt upon this, that Jesus
   was the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.

   If there are to be many conversions worked in any place, the preacher
   must be a man taught of God and he must persevere, even though he has
   been unsuccessful. But he must see to it that this is the staple of all
   his sermons, the raw material out of which he makes every
   discourse--"Jesus and Jesus the Lamb! Jesus the Sin Bearer." He must
   ever be crying, "You Sinners, see your sins laid on Him! You guilty,
   look to Him! Trust Him! There is life in a look at Him. He has taken
   your sins and carried your sorrows--look to Him!" Let the preacher
   stammer here and he is undone. Let him be unsound on the Atonement. Let
   him speak in feeble strains, as though he apologized for so
   old-fashioned a doctrine and you shall hear of no conversions from
   January to December.

   But let him hold this to be the first and most important Truth--that
   Jesus Christ came into the world to be a Sin Bearer for sinners, even
   the chief, and there must be conversions! God were not true to His
   promise, the Truth were no longer the potent thing it has proved itself
   to be in the olden times if souls were not quickened and turned to God
   by such a ministry as this! O you who preach the Gospel, keep close to
   this, "Behold the Lamb of God!" You young men who stand up in the
   streets, make this your topic! And you who minister to the Church of
   God, give them all the doctrines of the Gospel, but still always come
   back to this as the needle comes to its pole--"Behold the Lamb of God
   which takes away the sin of the world!"

   In these two conversions by public ministry it is interesting to
   observe the process. Carefully notice the narrative. A spirit of
   enquiry was stirred up in Andrew and his companion and they began to
   follow Christ, not exactly as disciples as yet, but as searchers. If I
   may say so, they followed Christ's back. They had not come to see His
   face yet, or to sit at His feet. They followed His back as some do who,
   being impressed under the Word, have a desire after Christ and intend
   to set about an honest investigation of His claims to their faith.
   While they are following behind Christ, He turns round and faces them.

   Oh, what a blessed turning for them! It was a blessed turning for Peter
   when the Lord turned and looked upon him! And in this case while they
   are, as it were, following His back, He turns and He looks upon them. I
   cannot tell you how much love there was in His eyes. The love of a
   mother to her first child may perhaps picture the love of Jesus Christ
   to these, His first disciples. He was God, He was Man, He was God's own
   Son. But He had never been a Master of disciples till that moment. Now
   He springs to a rank which He had not obtained before. Now He has some
   who will call Him "Rabbi," and will be willing to be guided by His
   teaching. He looks round upon them. Even so, when enquiry is excited by
   the ministry, and men begin to search, Jesus Christ looks upon them.
   With an eye of earnest affection He regards them and assists them in
   their search.

   Jesus put to them the question, "What do you seek?"--a very modest
   question. Notice it. It is the first word of Christ's ministry. It is
   the first word I find Christ speaking at all in public--"What do you
   seek?" And was not it a very comprehensive question? "What is that you
   seek?" If there are any honest enquirers here after salvation, He puts
   the same question to you this morning--"What do you seek?" Are you
   seeking pardon? You shall find it in Me. Are you seeking peace? I will
   give you rest. Are you seeking purity? I will take away your sin. A new
   heart will I give you and a right spirit will I put within you. What
   are you seeking? Some solid resting place for your soul upon earth and
   a glorious hope for yourself in Heaven? Whatever you seek, it is here.

   What a text this might be for a missionary when first consulted by some
   of the awakened heathen, when he should say, "You are on the search
   after Truth. Now what is it you really want? What do you seek? What is
   it? Because whatever it is that the human heart in its right state can
   possibly seek after--all that is to be found in Christ." Christ meets
   the man who is in an enquiring frame of mind by suggesting to him
   further enquiry. He stirs up the heart. While the soul's fire is
   burning He puts fuel to the flame.

   They say, "Master, where do you dwell?" And His answer to them is,
   "Come and see." This is just how the process of conversion is worked in
   men's hearts. They want to know more of Christ and He says to them,
   "Come and see." You would have peace--come and see whether I can give
   it to you. I tell you that if you trust Me, your peace shall be like a
   river and your righteousness like the waves of the sea. "Come and see."
   You say you want purity--just try now the effect of the obedience of
   faith. See if it does not change your heart and renew your spirit.
   "Come and see." O you who are seeking and asking questions about Christ
   and about His Gospel and His Person and His pedigree, "Come and see."

   The best way to be convinced of the potency of our holy Gospel is to
   try it for yourselves. If you are honest seekers, if the Grace of God
   has made you so, then come and test and try! "Blessed is every man that
   trusts in Him." This is our witness and our testimony. But if you want
   to be sure of it for yourselves, "Come and see." They took Christ at
   His word. They came and they saw. We are not told what they saw, but we
   are told what was the result--they stopped with Him that night and they
   remained with Him all His days and became His faithful disciples.

   my dear Friend, if you would but come and see Christ! If by humble
   earnest prayer you would give your heart up to Him and then trust in
   Him implicitly to be your Guide, you would never lament the decision!
   If Jesus proves a liar to you, then desert Him! If His promises are not
   true, then stand no longer numbered with His disciples. But give Him a
   trial--

   " O make but trial of His love!
   Experience will decide how blest are they and only they,
   Who in His Truth confide."

   You see, then, the way in which God's Grace works through the Word--it
   excites a spirit of enquiry, then a still further enquiry, then the
   test of experience--and afterwards leads to the giving up of the heart
   to Christ.

   II. The next case is a very different one. The third of Christ's
   disciples, one Simon Peter, was brought in by PRIVATE INSTRUMENTALITY
   and not by the public preaching of the Word. Observe the forty-first
   verse, "Andrew first finds his own brother Simon, and says unto him, We
   have found the Messiah, which is, being interpreted, the Christ." This
   case is but the pattern of all cases where spiritual life is vigorous.
   As soon as ever a man is found by Christ, he begins to find others.

   The word "first" implies that he did not give it up afterwards--he
   first found his own brother Simon! How many he found afterwards I
   cannot tell, but I will be bound to say that Andrew continued to be a
   fisher of men till he was taken up to the third Heaven. He found very
   many after he had found Peter. The first instinct of the new-born life
   is to desire the good of others. I will not believe that you have
   tasted of the honey of the Gospel if you can eat it all yourself. True
   Grace puts an end to all spiritual monopoly.

   1 know there are some who think there is no Grace beyond their own
   Chapel. They believe that God never works beyond the walls of their own
   tabernacle. Beyond the range of the voice of their minister everything
   is unsound, unorthodox, pretensions perhaps, but still fatally
   delusive. They hold that all others are out of the bond of the Covenant
   and, not unlike those ancient wranglers in the land of Uz, they say,
   "We are the men and wisdom will die with us." Surely God's people never
   talk in that fashion, or if they do, they are then speaking the
   language of Ashdod and not the speech of the child of Israel, for the
   Israelite's tongue drops with love and his speech is full of the
   anxious desire that others may be brought in!

   Look at our Apostle Paul. You shall never find stronger
   predestinarianism than you read in the ninth chapter of Romans, and yet
   what does he say? His heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is
   that they may be saved. He had heaviness of heart, he says, for his
   Brethren, his kinsmen according to the flesh. There was no man more
   anxious to convert souls than Paul, though there was no man more sound
   in the doctrine of the election of God. He knew it was not of him that
   wills, nor of him that runs, but yet he could say as Samuel did, "God
   forbid that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you."

   See, then, that the first desire of a Christian man is to endeavor to
   bring others to the Savior. Relationship has a very stern demand upon
   our first individual efforts. Andrew, you did well to begin with Simon.
   I do not know, my Brethren, whether there are not some Christians
   giving away tracts at other people's houses who would do well to give
   away a tract at their own. I wonder whether there are not some going
   out to the villages preaching who had better remain at home teaching
   their own children--or whether even in the Sunday school there may not
   be those who come before God to perform one duty, while their hands are
   stained blood-red with the murder of another duty. Your first business
   is at home. You may have a call to teach other people's children--that
   may be--but certainly you have an imperative call to teach your own.
   You may or you may not be called to look after the people of a
   neighboring town or village, but certainly you are called to see after
   your own servants, your own kinsfolk and acquaintances. Let your
   religion begin at home.

   We have heard of some people who export their best commodities--many
   traders do--I do not think the Christian should imitate them in that.
   At least let the Christian have all his conversation everywhere of the
   best savor, but let him have a care to put forth the sweetest fruit of
   spiritual life and testimony at home and in the circle of his own
   kinsfolk and acquaintances. Andrew, you did well, first, to find your
   brother Simon. When he went to find him he may not have thought of what
   Simon would become. Why, Simon was worth ten Andrews, as far as we can
   gather from the Evangelists! Peter was a very prince among the
   Apostles! And with that ready tongue of his and that bold, dashing,
   daring spirit--with that confident, resolute soul--there were none of
   them a match for Peter!

   John might excel in love, but still Peter was verily a leader among the
   Apostles, and Andrew would but little compare with him. You may be
   yourself but very deficient in talent and yet you may be the means of
   bringing a great man to Christ. Ah, dear Friend, you little know the
   possibilities which are in you! You may but speak a word to a child and
   in that child there may be slumbering now a great heart which shall
   stir the Christian Church in years to come. Andrew has only two
   talents, but then finds Peter. Andrew's testimony to Peter is worthy of
   remark. There was great modesty in it and that, I dare say, commended
   it to Peter.

   He did not say, "I have found the Messiah"--he says, "We." Whoever was
   the other disciple, he gives him his share of the discovery. Our speech
   never loses force by losing pride but generally increases its power in
   proportion to its modesty, though that modesty must never interfere
   with boldness. His testimony was very plain and very positive. He did
   not beat around the bush or hesitate, but it is just this--"We have
   found the Messiah." Plain and unadorned was the statement, very
   positive. He did not say, "I think we have," or, "I trust we have,"
   but, "we have." And this was just the thing for Simon Peter.

   Peter wanted positive and plain dealing and he was a man who wanted it
   pushed home by a brother's friendly voice, or else it had little
   availed him to speak of Christ at all. When he was brought to Jesus,
   observe the process of conversion. Jesus describes to him his present
   state. He said, "You are Simon, son of Jona." Some interpret this, "You
   are Simon, the son of the timid dove." He explains to him what he
   was--shows that He knew him--that He understood both his boldness and
   his cowardice--both his rashness and his constancy. And then, when He
   had told him what he was, Jesus gave him a new name indicative of the
   nature which His Grace would give--"You shall be called Cephas, a
   stone."

   Now this is the general plan of conversion. It is the plan in every
   case, really, though not apparently. Nature is discovered and Grace is
   imparted. The old name we are taught to read with sorrow and a new name
   is given to us and we rejoice in it. There may be some here who have
   not been converted to God under the ministry but under the words of a
   Sunday school teacher, or a sister, or a friend. Thank God and take
   courage. It does not matter how you are converted, so long as you are
   resting upon Jesus only!

   If you have not been a searcher of the Word, if Christ has never seemed
   to say to you, "Come and see," yet if your nature has been changed and
   you have received a new name--if there is a radical change in the
   rest--you are a child of God. That you are brought into the fellowship
   of the saints is an illustration of the unity of God's purpose. That
   there should be distinctive marks in your conversion is quite in
   harmony with the diversity of His operations.

   III. "The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee and find
   Philip and say unto him, Follow Me." The fourth disciple is called
   without either the public Word or private instruction--he is called
   directly BY THE VOICE OF JESUS. Now in truth all men are so called, for
   the voice of John or the voice of Andrew is really the voice of Jesus
   Christ speaking through their instrumentality. But in some cases no
   apparent instrumentality is used. We have known some who on a sudden
   have felt impressions, from where they came or where they tended they
   did not know.

   In the midst of business we have known the workman suddenly check his
   plane--a great thought has entered into his brain--where it came from
   he could not tell. We have known a man wake up at midnight--he could
   not tell why, but a holy calm was upon him and as the moon was shining
   through the window there seemed to be a holy light shining into his
   soul and he began to think. We have known such things to
   occur--surprising cases--when men have been planning deeds of vice.

   Was it not so with Colonel Gardner--that very night about to perpetrate
   a crime and yet stopped by Sovereign Grace upon the very brink of it,
   without any apparent instrumentality? We can not tell, Brethren, when
   God may regenerate His elect, for though we are to use means and cry to
   God to send forth laborers into the vineyard, yet the Sovereign Lord of
   All will frequently work without them. The Word which has been heard in
   years gone by. The Scripture which was known in childhood may, by the
   direct power of the Holy Spirit, without any immediate apparent means,
   turn the man from darkness to Light. Jesus Christ spoke but two words,
   but those words were enough--"Follow Me"--and Philip at once obeyed.
   What preparation of heart there had been before, I cannot tell. What
   still small voice had been speaking before this in Philip's ear, we do
   not know. Certainly the only outward means was this voice of Christ,
   "Follow Me."

   And there may be in this House some who will be converted this morning.
   You do not know why you are here. You cannot tell why you strayed in.
   But yet it may be--God knows--Christ would have you come here because
   He would come here Himself. Is not there something which invites a
   pause in that word, "would," as we read it in this verse?-- "The day
   following Jesus would go forth into Galilee." Is not there something of
   the Divine necessity which we have often noticed in another place?--"He
   must needs go through Samaria." Did not He feel instinctively that
   there was a soul there which He must meet with and He must go after it
   and speak the all-commanding, sin-subduing Word?

   Perhaps this morning Jesus would come to the Tabernacle! Jesus would
   come here because He knows that Philip is come here, too. Philip, where
   are you? You may have lived in sin and despised Christ, but if He says,
   "Follow Me," I beseech you obey His word and follow Him! To follow
   Christ is the picture of Christian discipleship in every form. Follow
   Christ in your doctrines--believe what He teaches! Follow Christ in
   your faith--trust Him implicitly with your soul! Follow Him in your
   actions--let Him be your example and Guide! Follow Him in
   ordinances--in Baptism follow Him and at His Table follow Him!

   To every deed of daring, to every place of spiritual communion, to the
   mountain of secret prayer, or to the crowd in open ministry, follow
   Him! According to your measure tread in the footsteps of your Lord and
   Master. And this, I say, may be directed to one who has had no other
   instrumentality used upon him, but just the mysterious voice of
   Christ-- "Follow Me." It was so with the third case. Perhaps of the
   three this experience is the highest. The first two were told, "Come
   and see," and they came to understand the value of Christ. But this one
   is made to follow--he carries out practically that which the others did
   but see.

   The second conversion before us attains a higher degree than the first.
   But this is the highest of all when the change of nature, as in the
   case of Peter, now leads to a change of action, as in the case of
   Philip, who arises and follows Christ.

   IV. I hope I have not wearied you, for there is yet the fourth case of
   the fifth disciple, which differs from them all-- Nathanael. What shall
   we say of Nathanael? Was he converted by ministry? It does not appear
   so. Was he converted by PRIVATE INSTRUMENTALITY? He was partly so.
   Philip finds Nathanael, but Philip's finding of Nathanael was not quite
   so effectual as Christ's finding of Philip. When Christ found Philip,
   Philip believed. But when Philip found Nathanael, Nathanael would not
   believe. He said, "Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?"

   Philip is partly the instrument, but there is something more. Jesus
   Christ Himself shows His own power BY TELLING TO

   NATHANAEL THE SECRETS OF HIS HEART. But still, Nathanael's conversion
   to Christ seems to me to be PARTLY OWING TO THE STATE IN WHICH HE THEN
   WAS. He was already in some sense a saved man--he was a devout
   Israelite. He was a true seeker of the Messiah beneath the fig tree.
   Well, then, there were these things put together--there was a
   preparation of heart which was doubtless worked of God.

   But this preparation did not bring him to Christ, though it made him
   ready for Christ. It brought him to God in prayer, but it did not bring
   him yet to the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. Then
   came Philip's instrumentality and then came Christ's Divine Word which
   convinced Nathanael and led him to put his trust in the Messiah. This
   is a sort of composite case and doubtless there are many in the Church
   of God, who, if you should ask them, "How were you converted?" would be
   somewhat puzzled to give the answer.

   We find in our Church Meetings a very large proportion of people who
   say, "Well, I cannot trace my conversion to any one sermon--many
   sermons have impressed me--indeed, most do. I cannot say, Sir, that I
   was converted when I was a child, but I sometimes think I was, for even
   at that time I was the subject of many impressions and I certainly did
   offer prayer. Yet there was a time," they will tell you, "there was a
   time when I seemed to come out more distinctly into the Light. And when
   I could say of Christ, 'You are the Son of God! You are the King of
   Israel,' but I cannot say exactly when the sun rose."

   Now this, I think, was Nathaniel's case. Perhaps trained and brought up
   by godly parents, he had been in the habit of prayer--that prayer was
   somewhat ignorant--but it was very sincere. He sought the solitude of
   his shady garden and under the fig tree poured out his heart unto the
   Lord. That man is not saved. No! But there is a great part of the work
   done. Do not tell me that that man in his prayer has nothing in him
   more than the blasphemer. I tell you that he needs as much as the
   blasphemer does to have an effectual Word from Christ, but still there
   is a preparatory work in this man which there is not even in Philip, or
   in Simon Peter. There is a something, not meritorious, but still
   preparatory to the reception of the Gospel of Christ.

   And when you labor for the conversion of such a man as this--and I do
   hope there may be some in this crowd--then it does not matter whether
   it is the ministry, or whether it is private instrumentality--there is
   sure to be good result because there is good ground to begin with. God
   has already furrowed and plowed the soil and so when the seed is
   scattered, there may be a little objection at first, but ultimately it
   will take root. Be looking out then, dear Friends, you who know how to
   talk to others about their souls! And wherever you see anything like
   devotion, even if it is mistaken and ignorant, look at that case! Be
   especially hopeful about it and try, if you can, to inform that person,
   "We have found Him of whom Moses in the Law and the Prophets did
   write."

   Introduce Christ, talk of Jesus, bring these Nathanaels to Jesus--these
   who are like the honest and good ground, these men without guile or
   cunning--bring them to Jesus! Still, mark you, their prayers and your
   instrumentality will not be enough unless Christ shall meet them with
   some startling, soul-discovering Word and shall say, "Before that
   Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you." Ah,
   you seeking Soul, Christ sees you! Before you came here this morning
   Jesus saw you! Before you hear the challenge, "Look to Christ," Christ
   has looked upon you. If you are truly seeking in the loneliness of that
   upper room, or in that field behind the hedge, Jesus sees you!

   When you are by the wayside and your heart is going up, "Lord, save me,
   or I perish," Jesus sees you! One of you has been writing to me this
   morning, and you say, "Pray for me that I may be saved, for I want to
   be saved." Ah, my Friend, if you want to be saved, Jesus wants to save
   you and so you are both agreed on that point! You, like Nathanael, are
   seeking Him. And I come this morning, like Philip and I long to bring
   you to Jesus, my Master. Oh, how I pray Him to speak to you and if so,
   He will tell you that He knew you when you were dead in sin and loved
   you, notwithstanding all!

   And therefore He brought you to this House to hear His Word. Mark you,
   Nathanael's is the best case of the whole! He was favored above many.
   Who was the first man that ever had a promise from Christ? It was
   Nathanael! What was that? Why, that promise seems to me to be the sum
   of the Gospel--or rather the token-promise of the Gospel--which every
   Christian should carry in his hand. Jesus said, "Because I said unto
   you, I saw you under the fig tree, believe you? You shall see greater
   things than these." Nathanael was the first man who ever received a
   promise from the lips of the Lord Jesus when He was here on earth!

   O you seeking Nathanaels, I think this is a promise for you--"You shall
   see greater things than these"--you shall see yourself pardoned! You
   shall see your prayers ascending Jacob's ladder and blessings coming
   down from God to rest upon your soul! I had hoped to have brought out
   many more points, but indeed, the chapter is too full for any to handle
   in so brief a time. You will observe, however, that I have given you
   just a glance at the surface of it which will suffice to show that the
   means of conversion and the general tenor of conversion will be found
   to differ in each case. Perhaps Nathanael's is the highest of all--he
   receives Christ in a fuller way than any of the others and he enjoys
   greater promises than they do.

   But still they are all genuine, though they are not one of them like
   the other, except that John and Andrew may be put together. Judge not,
   therefore, your conversion by its means or by its particular form, but
   judge it by its fruit. Does it bring you to Jesus? Are you depending
   upon Him now? If so, go your way--your sins, which are many, are
   forgiven you! Eat the fat and drink the sweet, for God accepts
   you--therefore rejoice! But and if you have had a thousand conversions,
   if you are not resting on Jesus this morning, tremble, for your refuge
   is a refuge of lies! Your hope is a spider's web--God deliver you from
   it and bring you now to rest upon the finished work and the perfect
   Sacrifice of the Lord Jesus! And then, with Andrew and Peter and John,
   and Philip and Nathanael you shall meet before the Throne to praise Him
   who is the Son of God and the King of Israel! The Lord bless you, for
   Christ's sake. Amen.

                   Unbelievers Stumbling--Believers Rejoicing

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, MAY 22, 1864, BY THE REV. C, H. SPURGEON,
   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "As it is written, Behold I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and rock of
   offense: and whoever believes on Him shall not be ashamed." Romans
   9:33.

   OUR Apostle was inspired of God and yet he was moved to quote passages
   out of the Old Testament. The Spirit of God might have dictated new
   words to him. He might have shown him how to confirm the Truth by other
   arguments, but He is not pleased to do so. He moves His servant to
   establish the present Truth by Truths formerly revealed and thus He
   sets us an example of searching the Scriptures and prizing the ancient
   Oracles of God. The passage before us appears to be composed of two
   Scriptures woven into one, a method not very infrequent with the
   Apostles. A part of the text before us is found in Isaiah 28:16.

   The Apostle does not quote verbatim, but gives us rather the sense than
   the words--"Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried
   stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation: he that believes
   shall not make haste." But the Apostle inlays this word of Prophecy
   with another, selecting this time from Isaiah 8:14--"And He shall be
   for a sanctuary. But for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense
   to both the houses of Israel." I cannot help making an observation or
   two upon these passages before I come to the text before us.

   In Isaiah 8:14 you will perceive a striking proof of Christ's Divinity.
   Observe the thirteenth verse--"Sanctify the Lord of Hosts Himself. And
   let Him be your fear and let Him be your dread. And He," that is the
   Lord of Hosts, "shall be for a sanctuary" to Believers, "but a stone of
   stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel."
   Isaiah utters a prophecy of the Lord of hosts. Paul quotes it in
   reference to the Lord Jesus Christ, plainly intending us to infer that
   the Lord Jesus Christ is no other than Jehovah Himself!

   We learn from the other passage another Truth of God which serves more
   closely to illustrate our text. In Isaiah 28:16, we read, "Behold, I
   lay in Zion for a foundation a stone." The Apostle has omitted the
   words "for a foundation," and has inserted the words of the other
   passage, "a stumbling stone, a rock of offense." But the original
   prophecy in Isaiah serves to show us that God's real object in laying
   Christ in Zion was not that men might stumble at Him, but that He might
   be a foundation for their hopes. The real object of God was that Christ
   might be the cornerstone of human confidence.

   But the result has been that to one set of men, renewed by Almighty
   Grace, Christ has become a sanctuary of refuge and a stone of
   dependence. And to others left to their own depravity He has become a
   rock of offense and a stumbling stone--thus the remarks upon the
   primitive Scriptures which Paul quotes. And now let us come to the
   verse itself. Our text tells us that many persons stumble at Christ.
   And, then, secondly, it assures us that those who receive Christ and
   believe in Him, shall have no cause to be ashamed.

   I. The first declaration needs no proof, for observation itself teaches
   us that MANY STUMBLE AT CHRIST. No sooner was God manifest in the
   flesh, than mortals began to stumble at Him. "Is not this the
   carpenter's son?" was the question of those who looked for worldly pomp
   and imperial grandeur. "His father and His mother we know, and His
   brothers and His sisters, are they not all with us?" was the whispered
   objection of His own townsmen. In His own country the greatest of all
   Prophets had no honor. Our Lord was rejected by all sorts of men. They
   looked at Him from different quarters, but all with the same scornful
   eye.

   The Pharisee stumbled at Him because He was not superstitions and
   ostentatious. Indeed, He did not wash His hands before He ate! Nor did
   He pray at the corner of the streets! Why, He entered into the company
   of publicans and sinners! He did not make broad His phylactery. He
   healed the sick upon the Sunday! He had no respect for traditions and
   therefore every righteous Pharisee abhorred Him. The Sadducee, on the
   other hand, much as He hated Pharisaic superstition, despised Christ
   equally as much. His objections were shot from quite another quarter.
   To him Christ was too superstitious, for the Sadducee would not believe
   in angels or spirits, or the resurrection of the dead--all which
   beliefs the Prophet of Nazareth openly avowed.

   Philosophical skepticism detested Jesus because His teaching had in it
   very much of the supernatural element. All His life long, in the high
   courts of Herod or of Pilate, or in the lowest rank of the mob of
   Judea, Christ was despised and rejected of men. They had long ago
   persecuted all the Prophets whom the Lord had sent and it was little
   marvel that they now assailed the Master Himself. "We have piped unto
   you and you have not danced. We have mourned unto you and you have not
   lamented," might all the Prophets of God say, for Israel received
   neither the lonely man, whose meat was locusts and wild honey, nor the
   more genial Spirit who came eating and drinking.

   They put all God's Prophets away and would have none of their rebukes.
   And when the Son Himself had come, they said, "This is the Heir, let us
   kill Him, that the inheritance may be ours." The Jews, with one voice
   rejected Him, save only the remnant, according to the election of
   Grace. But the Jew is not alone in his offense at the Cross. We know
   that when the Gospel was carried afterwards to the Gentiles, Christ
   Crucified was a stumbling stone to them. The polished Greeks, with
   their various systems of philosophy, expected in the Messiah deep
   thinking and classic taste. But when they heard Paul preach the
   resurrection of the dead, they saw nothing flattering to their
   philosophy and therefore they openly mocked him.

   While the Jew gathered up his broad-bordered garment and called Christ
   a stumbling block, the Greek marched off to his classic temple or to
   his scientific academe and cried, "Foolishness! The men who talk thus
   must be mad!" In every age, even to the present time, wherever Jesus
   Christ is preached, the human heart at once has been stirred with wrath
   against Him. God's ambassador has found men unwilling to receive the
   peace which he proclaims. God's dear Son, who came with no words but
   those of mercy and of tenderness, has been abhorred and rejected by the
   very men whom He came to bless. "He came unto His own and His own
   received Him not."

   However, we have very little to do with these past ages--we have far
   more to do with the present and with ourselves. And it is a sad thing
   to know that among this assembly, though I suppose we all call
   ourselves Christians, there are many who still find Christ Jesus to be
   a stumbling stone to them and a rock of offense. It is a lamentable
   fact that there are hundreds of thousands in London to whom the Gospel
   of Christ is as little known as to Hindus or Tartars. Christ is not a
   stumbling block to these--they are unaware of Him and therefore they
   have not the guilt which some of you have--of having heard of Him and
   having rejected Him.

   Among the present assembly there are some who stumble at Christ because
   of His holiness. He is too strict for them. They would be Christians
   but they cannot renounce their sensual pleasures. They would be washed
   in His blood, but they desire still to roll in the mire of sin. Willing
   enough, the mass of men would be to receive Christ, if, after receiving
   Him, they might continue in their drunkenness, their wantonness and
   self-indulgence. But Christ lays the axe at the root of the tree--He
   tells them that these things must be given up--"because of these things
   comes the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience," and,
   "without holiness no man can see the Lord."

   Human nature kicks at this. "What? May I not enjoy one darling lust?
   May I not indulge myself at least now and then in these things? Must I
   altogether forsake my old habits and my old ways? Must I be made a new
   creature in Christ Jesus?" These are terms too hard, conditions too
   severe, and so the human heart goes back to the flesh pots of Egypt and
   clings to the garlic and the onions of the old estate of bondage and
   will not be set free even though a greater than Moses lifts up the rod
   to part the sea and promises to give to them a Canaan flowing with milk
   and honey. Christ offends men because His Gospel is intolerant of sin.

   Others stumble at our blessed Lord because they do not like the plan of
   being saved altogether and alone through faith. Have I any such here? I
   suppose I have. They say, "What? Are our good works to go for nothing?
   Is there nothing that we can do to assist in our salvation? You tell us
   that it is trusting in Christ alone without anything else which
   justifies the soul. Then we do not understand it, or if we understand
   it we do not like it." This is too humbling, too simple, too easy.
   "Why," says the man who has always been to his parish Church or to his
   Meeting House, who owes nobody anything and is kind to the poor--"Why,
   then I am no better off than the harlot who walks the pavement at
   midnight! Or the thief who is spending his month at the treadmill."

   You are no better off, my Hearer, as to your eternal salvation if you
   refuse to believe in Christ! The damnation of the openly ungodly is
   sure, but so is yours, if, after having heard the plan of salvation you
   turn upon your heels and despise it because you prefer your own
   righteousness to the righteousness of God! Ah, how many are shipwrecked
   upon this rock, swallowed up in this quicksand? They would be saved but
   they will not bow the knee. They are not content to take God's
   salvation by faith in Christ Jesus and so they perish through their
   willful pride.

   I have known others who stumble at Christ because of the doctrine which
   He preaches, more especially the Doctrines of Grace. There will come
   into this House, some who, if we preach a sermon upon Christian virtue,
   will say, "I enjoyed that discourse." But if we preach Christ and begin
   to talk about the deep doctrines which lie underneath the Gospel, such
   as election, effectual calling, and eternal and immutable love,
   straightway they are angry almost to the gnashing of their teeth. They
   would have Christ, they say, but they cannot accept these doctrines.
   "What? God saves whom He wills and not so much as ask the creature's
   permission? Shall He do just as He pleases with us as a potter does
   with lumps of clay? Are we to be told to our face that it is not of him
   that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shows mercy? We
   cannot endure this--we will betake ourselves to some place where man is
   made more of and where God is not set so high above our heads!"

   Ah, but my Friend, Jesus Christ will not shape His doctrine to please
   you, nor tone down the Truth of Scripture to suit your carnal taste.
   Mark you, it is in the ninth of Romans that my text is found, and in
   that ninth of Romans you have the most plain and bold declaration
   anywhere on record concerning the Sovereignty of Divine Grace and if
   you choose to make that Sovereignty a reason for not believing in
   Christ you will perish for your pains. And, perish deservedly, too,
   because you will quarrel with God's Word and damn your own soul to be
   avenged on God's Sovereignty.

   But indeed, my dear Friends, when sinners are resolved to object to
   Christ, it is the easiest thing in the world to find something to
   object to. I have met with some who stumble at Christ's people. They
   will say, "Well, I would believe in Christ, but look at professors! See
   how inconsistent they are! See many Church members, in what an unholy
   way they walk and even some ministers," and then they will begin to
   quote various faults of some of God's eminent servants and they think
   this is an excuse for going to Hell themselves, because others do not
   walk straight in the way to Heaven!

   O, will you send your soul to Hell because another man is not all he
   should be? What if David falls and David is restored, is this any
   reason why you should fall and never be restored? What if some pilgrims
   to Heaven do turn into Bypath Meadow and have to come limping back into
   the road--is this a reason why you should follow the road to the City
   of Destruction? I think, Man, that this should only make you the more
   diligent to make your calling and election sure! The shipwrecks of
   others should make you sail more carefully. The bankruptcies of other
   men should make you trade with greater diligence and humility. To quote
   the defects of others as a reason why you should continue in the error
   of your ways is a fool's method of reasoning! Take heed, lest you find
   out your folly in the flames of Hell!

   The real objection of the natural man is not, however, to God's people,
   nor to the plan of salvation itself, so much as to Christ. The rock of
   offense is Christ--to the Person of Christ. You will not have this Man
   to reign over you! You are not willing that He should wear the crown
   and have all the honor of your salvation. You had rather perish in your
   sin than that Jesus Christ should be magnified in your salvation. This
   is a severe charge, you will tell me. If it is not true, I pray you
   prove it false by believing in Jesus! If you have no objection to
   Christ, accept Him! Sinner, I charge you, if you say you do not stumble
   at Christ, then lay hold upon Him! If He is not obnoxious to you, clasp
   Him in your arms now!

   Why, Man, if you are in your senses, since Christ can save you with an
   eternal salvation, you will certainly grasp Him, unless there is some
   objection in the way. And because you do not lay hold of Him, I tell
   you there is some hindrance in your sinful heart--an offense at Christ
   which will be your ruin unless God delivers you from it. Now may God
   help me to reason a few minutes with those who are not believers in
   Christ, who have made Him a stumbling stone and a rock of offense.

   Dear Friend, let me come close to you and take your hand and talk with
   you. Have you ever considered how much you insult God the Father by
   rejecting Christ? If you were invited to a man's feast and you should
   come to the table and dash down every dish and throw them on the ground
   and trample on them, would not this be an insult? If you were a poor
   beggar at the door and a rich man had bid you into his feast out of
   pure charity, what do you think you would deserve if you had treated
   his provisions in this way? And yet this is just your case. God owes
   you nothing. You are a poor sinner without any claim upon Him and yet
   He has been pleased to prepare a table for you. His oxen and His
   fatlings have been killed and now you will not come!

   No! You do worse! You raise objections to the feast! You despise the
   pleasant land and the goodly provision of God! Just think at what an
   expense the provision of salvation has been made! The eternal Father
   gave His Son. Hark you--His Well-Beloved, the Darling of His heart, His
   only Son--He gave Him to DIE, and do you despise such a Gift as this?
   What do you think? Would it not bring the blood into your face if you
   should give your only son to fight for your country and they to whom he
   was given should despise you and your gift? If out of some superhuman
   patriotism for your country's good you should even slay your son, would
   it not cut you to the quick if men should laugh at you and scoff the
   deed?

   And yet such you do to the eternal Father, who for the love of men has
   rent His Darling from His bosom, nailed Him to the tree and filled Him
   with unutterable pains. You despise the unspeakable gift, the richest
   deed of bounty which even the infinite heart of God could have
   imagined, or the infinite hand of God could have performed! You despise
   all this! You touch God, let me tell you, in the apple of His eye. You
   do now wound Him in the most tender part! You might better have run
   upon the edge of His sword or dashed yourself upon the bosses of His
   buckler than to despise and reject His Only-Begotten Son, slaughtered
   for human guilt!

   Think again, what a proof is here of your sinfulness and how readily
   will you be condemned at the last when this sin is written on your
   forehead. Why, Man, there will be no reason to bring up any other sins
   against you! The book in which your faults have been recorded scarcely
   need be opened, for this, alone, will be enough! You have made Christ a
   stumbling block, you have objected to God's dear Son--why need we any
   other witness? Out of this one mouth you shall be condemned--"You did
   abhor the Prince of Glory. You did refuse Him your heart"--take him
   back to the place from where he came. What if he has never been an
   adulterer or a whoremonger, yet is not this enough? Does not this show
   the blackness of the traitor's heart and the vileness of his character?
   He would not have Christ! He made the foundation which God laid in
   Zion, "a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense." What do you think
   of this, my Hearer?

   Moreover, as this will be a swift witness to condemn you, how will this
   increase your misery? Do you think God will be tender over you when you
   have not been tender with His Son? When He shall cast you into Hell,
   will He make the flames less hot? Do you think His vengeance will be
   cool towards the man who stumbled at His Son? No! But this shall whet
   the edge of His sword. "This traitor did do despite unto the blood of
   Christ." He will pour oil upon the flames. "This man made My
   Only-Begotten Son to be a stumbling stone. And now will I prove to him
   that whoever stumbles upon this stone shall be broken and upon whomever
   it shall fall, it shall grind him to powder."

   Do you think that a king would be any the more inclined to be merciful
   towards a traitor if he knew that that traitor had despised his son?
   No. I think the sentence would be the more severe. Ah, Sinner! If all
   other sinners escape, you who have heard the Gospel shall not. If God's
   arrows miss other sinners, they shall strike you! You shall be the
   special object of almighty vengeance because you were disobedient,
   stumbling at this stumbling stone. Think again, Man, will not this seat
   the eternity of your woe? How can you escape if you neglect so great a
   salvation? You have broken down the only bridge which could have led
   you into safety! You have pulled down the only refuge which could have
   protected you from Divine wrath--"There remains no more sacrifice for
   sin."

   How can there be? Do you think when you are in Hell that Christ will
   come a second time to die for you? Will He pour out His blood again to
   bring you from the place of torment? Man, do you have so vain an
   imagination as to dream that there will be a second ransom offered for
   those who have not escaped the wrath to come, and that God the Holy
   Spirit will again come and strive with sinners who aforetime willfully
   rejected Him? No, inasmuch as even your Savior is objected to and you
   put eternal life from you and the foundation itself is a stumbling
   stone, there can remain nothing for you but a fearful looking for of
   judgment and of fiery indignation.

   And now one other word with you. Does not this view of the case make
   your heart tremble? Is it not enough to have broken God's Law? Why do
   you go the length of despising His Son? O my eyes! If you could weep
   forever you could never weep tears enough, because once you refused to
   look to Him who is now your daily joy. Is not this one of the worst
   sins we shall have to confess? And O Sinner, will not you confess it
   now? Will not this thought break your heart--that you have up to now
   despised the altogether lovely and loving One? May the Spirit of God
   drive that home as a nail in a sure place, and I think you will turn to
   the Redeemer and say, "My Lord and my God, forgive me that I have dealt
   so un- kindly with You. Accept me, receive me to Your bosom. Wash me in
   Your blood. Take me to be Your servant and save me with a great
   salvation."

   Happy is the man who has been brought by Divine Grace thus to confess
   his fault and stumble no longer. After all, what is there to stumble
   at? O my Hearer, why should you reject Christ? He is not a hard
   taskmaster--"His yoke is easy and His burden is light." Why should you
   refuse your own mercy? To be saved--is that a misfortune? To be
   cleansed from sin--is this a calamity? To be made a child of God--is
   that a disadvantage? To escape from Hell and fly to Heaven--is not this
   the most desirable of all mercies? Why, then, despise Christ? It is
   unreasonable! God deliver you from this unreasonable sin and bring you
   now to accept Christ with a perfect heart and He shall be praised for
   it forever.

   II. I shall now try, by the help of God's Spirit, to explain the second
   part--the more comforting part of the text, "WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM
   SHALL NOT BE ASHAMED." He shall be ashamed to think he did not believe
   be-fore--he shall be ashamed to think he does not believe more firmly
   now--he shall often feel shame and confusion of face on account of his
   ingratitude and his sinfulness and his wandering of heart. But the text
   means he shall not be ashamed of having trusted Christ. He that
   believes on Christ shall never have any cause to be ashamed of so
   doing.

   1. In handling this I shall first of all notice when those who trust
   Christ might be ashamed of having trusted Him. Well might they be
   ashamed if Christ should ever leave them. If it should ever come to
   this, that He who is the husband of my heart, should desert me and
   leave me a lone widow in the world. If, after having said, "I will
   never leave you nor forsake you," He should after all take Himself away
   and never indulge His servant with one smile from His face, I should
   then, indeed, have reason to be ashamed of having put my trust in such
   a fickle Savior.

   The Arminian's christ is one whom they have good reason to be ashamed
   of because he redeems men with his precious blood and yet they go to
   Hell. The Arminian's christ loves today but hates tomorrow. He saves by
   grace, but that grace is dependent upon man's use of grace. He does
   bring men out of a state of condemnation and he does justify them--but,
   after all, he lets them go back into a state of condemnation and they
   still perish! But the Christian's Christ is a very different Person,
   whom once He loves He never leaves, but loves them to the end. Where He
   has begun a good work He carries it on and perfects it.

   The Christian's Christ can say, "I give unto My sheep eternal life and
   they shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of My hands."
   Until the Christian finds that the Grace of God is clean gone, that
   Christ's love has ceased, he shall never have any cause to be ashamed.
   Again, the Christian would have cause to doubt if Christ were to fail
   him, either as to Providence or Grace, in his times of trial and
   temptation. When in the midst of the rivers, if the Lord does not
   sustain me, I shall have cause to blush for my hope. If, walking
   through the fires the flames do kindle upon me and I do not find the
   Lord to be my present help in the time of trouble, then I am put to
   shame.

   O Beloved, when will this happen? In six troubles He has been with you
   and in seven no evil has touched you. You have been brought very low!
   You could not have been much lower unless you had been in your grave.
   You have been very poor, scarcely having bread to eat, or raiment to
   put on! Everything in which you trusted has been cut from under you.
   You are left orphans in the world, with the exception of your Father
   which is in Heaven. But still, for all that, has not your bread been
   given you? Have not your waters been sure? And today must not your
   testimony be concerning God that He has been a Friend who sticks closer
   than a brother? Well, then, you never need be ashamed, because there
   never shall come a time when He shall leave you to perish through
   stress of trials or suffer you to be destroyed by the force of
   temptations.

   Again, a Christian would have cause to be ashamed if Christ's promises
   were not fulfilled. They are very rich and very full and there are very
   many of them--and if I take these promises and act upon God's Word and
   then, after all, find the promise to be mere waste paper--if the Lord
   breaks His own Oath, then I should be ashamed to have believed in an
   unfaithful God! But when will that be? Christian, has the time come
   with you yet? You have had promises applied with power to your heart
   and you have taken them to God in prayer. Let me appeal to your
   experience! Have they not been fulfilled beyond your expectation or
   your faith? Has not God done for you exceedingly abundantly above what
   you can ask or think?

   And yet this morning, perhaps, you are afraid His promise will not be
   kept! You have come here in lowness of spirit, you have had so many
   troubles during the week that you really begin to be ashamed of having
   trusted in God. Be ashamed of yourself for being ashamed! And depend on
   it, your confidence is not a thing to blush over. But O my Broth- ers
   and Sisters, how ashamed would the Christian be if when he came to die
   he should find no support, no kind angels near his bed, no Savior to
   bear his head up amidst the billows! But have you ever heard of a
   Christian who was ashamed in his dying hour? Is it not rather the sure
   witness of all the departed that their last moments have been gilded
   with the sunlight of Heaven?

   Have not they snug on their dying beds, with David, "Yes, though I pass
   through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for You
   are with me. Your rod and Your staff they comfort me"? If, indeed, we
   could wake up in the resurrection and find ourselves without a Savior.
   If we could stand at the judgment bar of God and find that Christ's
   blood had not made us clean. If, after all our faith in Him, we should
   hear Him say, "Depart, you cursed, into everlasting fire," then might
   we be ashamed! But our text assures us that we never shall have to
   suffer this. Let us then roll ourselves upon this sweet comfort--having
   believed in Christ we shall never in this life, nor in the life to
   come--need to be ashamed of our hope.

   2. Having noticed when the Christian might be ashamed, let us notice
   why he might be ashamed if such things were to come. I have sometimes
   thought, dear Friends, that in some respects, if the Bible were proven
   to be false, I should never be ashamed of having believed it. If there
   should be no Savior, I think that when I stand before God's Throne I
   shall not be ashamed of having believed the Gospel because, I think, I
   could dare to say even to the eternal God, "Great God, I believed of
   You that which reflected the highest honor upon Your Character. I
   believed You capable of a great deed of kindness, the giving of Your
   own Son. I believed You to be so just that You would not forgive
   without a punishment and yet so gracious that You would sooner give
   Your Son than not have mercy upon men.

   "I believed of You higher things than either Jew, or Mahommedan, or
   Heathen--and my soul did love You for it. I did preach what I thought
   would honor Your name and now that it turns out to be a mistake, I am
   not ashamed of having believed it, for it was such a thing as should
   have been true--Your Nature and your Character made it likely to be
   true and I mourn to think it is not, but I am not ashamed! I wish it
   had been. It would make You, great God, even more glorious than You
   are."

   Beloved, we are under no apprehension that it shall turn out to be so,
   for we know whom we have believed and we are persuaded that He is able
   to keep that which we have committed to Him. Why would a Christian be
   ashamed if the Gospel were untrue? We should be ashamed, first of all,
   because we have ventured our all upon its Truth. We have ventured our
   all upon Christ. The world says you should never put all your eggs in
   one basket. And when a man speculates in some one thing and it all
   comes down, wise people hold up their hands and say, "Ah, very
   imprudent, very imprudent! Better have three or four strings to your
   bow! You must not be depending on any one thing."

   The world is quite right in human things. But here are we--we are
   depending everything upon one Man--my soul has not a shadow of a hope
   anywhere else but in Christ and I know that your spirits have not even
   the ghost of a shadow of dependence anywhere but in the blood and
   righteousness of that Divine Redeemer who has completed our salvation
   and ascended up on high. If He can fail us, then all our hopes are
   gone! We are, of all men, most miserable. If our hope should turn out
   to be a delusion, we should be foolish, indeed, and have reason to be
   ashamed of our hope.

   We should be ashamed, again, because we have given up this life for the
   next--believing in the world to come, we have said, "This is not our
   rest, we have no abiding city here." The world's proverb is, "A bird in
   the hand is worth two in the bush." But we, on the other hand, have
   said that the bird in the hand is nothing at all--that the bird in the
   bush is everything. Our soul says, "Joy! We do not expect it here, it
   is there that joy is to be found." "Wealth? No man is rich on earth,
   riches are in Heaven, the true treasure is in Glory." "Love does not
   find a fit object here--our affection is set upon things above, where
   Christ dwells at the right hand of God."

   Now if things should turn out wrong and we have believed in vain, then
   we shall be ashamed of our hope, but not till then! Not till then,
   Beloved! And that shall be never! We know whom we have believed and we
   are confident that in giving up this earth we have only given up a
   handful of ashes that we may enjoy riches and Glory forever. Again, if
   Christ should fail us, we should be ashamed because we began boasting
   before we had ended the battle. "My soul shall make her boast in the
   Lord."

   I hope you can say, dear Friends, that though you have not entered
   Heaven and have not yet seen Christ face to face, yet you have learned
   to bask in the Cross of Christ and no man has been able to stop you in
   your glory. You have boasted in Christ! You have said that He is a sure
   Foundation, that He is a precious Husband, that He is All in All to you
   and worthy of your best love! But if He should fail you, why then, you
   would be in the position of a man who boasted before the time. But we
   shall never be ashamed! We do right to boast with a full mouth! Let us
   glory in the Lord. But oh, if He should fail us--which He never
   can--then were we ashamed, indeed!

   Besides, we have done more than boast! You and I have actually divided
   the spoil! And oh, if the battle should be lost, then we should be
   ashamed! We are told that in one of the great battles on the continent
   in the olden times, the French, before the battle began, commenced
   selling the English captives to one another and calculated how much
   each man would have of the spoil. But then, fortunately, they never
   gained the victory. But you and I have already entered into our
   rest--we have had the earnest of our inheritance--we have begun, even
   on earth, to eat the clusters of Eshcol. And if it should be a delusion
   we should be ashamed, but not till then. Courage, dear Friends! We may
   go boldly on dividing the spoil! For while Christ is true and God is
   faithful, there shall be no reason for being ashamed.

   I have known some ashamed when they have made a bad speculation because
   they have induced others to enter into it. They have been more ashamed
   to face their friends who have lost money than they have been to
   acknowledge that they lost themselves. You and I have been inducing
   others to embark in this great venture. We have taught others to
   believe in Christ. And some of us scarcely spend a day without winning
   some souls to confidence in Christ. Oh, sweet Assurance! We have not
   preached cunningly devised fables and shall never be ashamed!

   3. I must crave your patience just a moment while I now pass on to
   notice who are they who shall never be ashamed? The answer is general
   and special. The text says, "Whoever believes"--that is, any man who
   ever lived, or ever shall live, who believes in Christ shall never be
   ashamed. Whether he has been a gross sinner or a moralist. Whether he
   is learned or illiterate. Whether he is a prince or a beggar, it
   matters not--"Whoever believes in Christ shall never be ashamed." You,
   Man, over yonder, though you may very seldom come to the House of God,
   yet if you believe in Christ today you shall never be ashamed of Him.
   You who have sat in God's House for years and feel yourselves guilty of
   having rejected Christ, yet if now you trust Him you shall not be
   ashamed.

   But there is a specialty, it is "Whoever believes." Others shall be
   ashamed. There must be a real and hearty believing. There must be a
   simple confidence in the Person and work of Jesus--wherever this is
   there shall be no shame. "Ah," says one, "but I have such a little
   faith. I am afraid I shall be confounded." No, you come in under the
   "Whoever"-- "Whoever believes," though his faith is ever so little,
   shall never be ashamed. "Ah," says another, "but I have so many
   doubts." Still, dear Heart, since you believe you shall not be ashamed.
   All your doubts and your fears shall never damn you, for your faith
   will prevail.

   "Oh, but," says another, "my corruption is so strong! I have come this
   morning lamenting because of my imperfections. They have obtained the
   mastery of my faith and I have fallen during the week." Yes, Soul, all
   fallen as you are, yet if you believe you shall never be ashamed. Does
   sin stare you in the face? Do you feel very heavy under a sense of your
   own unworthiness? Dare to believe in Christ just as you are--sins and
   all--venture on Him without any other confidence. When frames are dark
   and graces dead, when evidences are black, when everything gives you a
   frown and a curse, yet dare to believe in Him!

   Now take Him to be your Friend when you have no other! Now flee to this
   Refuge when every other door is shut! Now that winter has frozen every
   brook, now come and drink of this Brook which flows on forever! This
   Well of Bethlehem which is within the gate can never fail you! And you
   need not to put your life in jeopardy to get it, it is free to you this
   moment! Stoop and drink confidently! Stoop and drink and you shall
   thirst no more, for, "Whoever believes in Him shall never be ashamed."

   4. To conclude, the text means more than it says, for whereas it says
   they shall not be ashamed, it means that they shall be glorified and
   full of honor! If you trust Christ today, it will bring you shame from
   men, it will ensure you trials and troubles--but it will also ensure
   you honor in the sight of God's holy angels and Glory at the last in
   the sight of the assembled universe! Where is the man who trusts Christ
   today? There he stands in the pillory and men say, "Aha! Aha! The fool!
   The fool! The fool! He trusts a God whom he cannot see! He believes in
   a Christ whom we have heard of but whom we never heard! He trusts in
   the blood of a crucified Galilean!

   The worldling cries, "We are too wise for that! We will believe
   geological theories, spiritualism, or metaphysics! We will believe the
   devil himself sooner than we will believe in Christ!" So they scoff at
   the man who trusts Christ. The scene is changed, the generation of the
   living has passed away and the world has become one great burial field.
   There they lay.

   Innumerable hillocks mark where the bodies of men are sleeping. The
   trumpet sounds, it rings clear through earth and Heaven and up from the
   graves rise bodies which have once been worm's meat and souls come back
   into those frames-- and now where is the man who trusted Christ?

   The trumpet has startled them all from their tombs and they awake
   together--"Where is the man who trusted in Christ?" Who is it that
   inquires for him? The King Himself upon the Throne has asked the
   question! King Jesus, sitting on His judgment seat, searches for His
   friends--"Where is the man who trusted in Me? Bring him here." See the
   change, no hooting and yelling and laughter and slander now! A
   triumphant squadron of bright spirits carry up the Believer to the
   right hand of Jesus and there he sits enthroned like Christ, sitting
   with Him to judge men and angels, reigning upon Christ's Throne in all
   Christ's splendor!

   "Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the King delights to honor,"
   thus shall it be done to the man who puts his trust in Christ! Come,
   Christian, whatever may be your state today, however the world's
   mockery may ring in your ears, think of that unwilling honor which the
   crowd of sinners will have to give you at the Last Great Day! Think of
   how your fame and reputation shall rise with your bones! And as worms
   cannot devour your body to prevent your rising, so shall not slander
   and rebuke devour your character to prevent its rising, too! Glory
   shall be yours--everlasting Glory--while your enemies shall be clothed
   with shame and eternal contempt!

   Well, what do you say, dear Hearers? On which side are you this
   morning? Is Christ a stumbling block to you? Will you go on stumbling
   at Him and objecting to Him? Do you say rather, "No, we will have
   Christ and trust Him." Oh, if the Lord has brought you to this, I will
   clap my hands for joy! And you, you Angels, strike your harps! You
   Seraphs! Tune your lyres anew, for there is joy in Heaven as there is
   joy on earth when a soul comes to put its trust in Christ! The Lord
   bring every one of us, for His name's sake. Amen. Amen.

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, MAY 29, 1864, BY THE REV. C. H. SPURGEON,
   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "For of Him and through Him and to Him, are all things: to whom be
   glory forever. Amen."

   Romans 11:36.

   MY text consists almost entirely of monosyllables, but it contains the
   loftiest of sublimities. Such a tremendous weight of meaning is
   concentrated here that an archangel's eloquence would fail to convey
   its teaching in all its glory to any finite minds, even if seraphs were
   his hearers. I will affirm that there is no man living who can preach
   from my text a sermon worthy of it. No, among all the sacred orators
   and the eloquent pleaders for God, there never did live and never will
   live a man capable of reaching the height of the great argument
   contained in these few simple words. I utterly despair of success and
   will not, therefore, make an attempt to work out the infinite Glory of
   this sentence.

   Our great God alone can expound this verse for He only knows Himself
   and He only can worthily set forth His own perfections. Yet I am
   comforted by this reflection that maybe, in answer to our prayers, God
   Himself may preach from this text this morning in our hearts. If not
   through the words of the speaker, yet by that still small voice to
   which the Believer's ear is so well accustomed. If thus He shall
   condescend to favor us, our hearts shall be lifted up in His ways.

   There are two things before us, the one worthy of our observation and
   the second of our imitation. You have in the text, first of all,
   doctrine and then devotion, The doctrine is high doctrine--"Of Him and
   through Him and to Him, are all things." The devotion is lofty
   devotion--"To whom be glory forever. Amen."

   I. Let us consider THE DOCTRINE. It is laid down by the Apostle Paul as
   a general principle that all things come of God--they are of Him as
   their source. They are through Him as their means. They are to Him as
   their end. They are of Him in the plan, through Him in the working and
   to Him in the Glory which they produce. Taking this general principle,
   you will find it applies to all things and it is ours to mark those in
   which it is most manifestly the case. May the Lord, by His Holy Spirit,
   open His treasures to us at this moment that we may be enriched in
   spiritual knowledge and understanding.

   Meditate, dear Friends, upon the whole range of God's works in Creation
   and Providence. There was a period when God dwelt alone and creatures
   were not. In that time before all time, when there was no day but, "The
   Ancient of Days"--when matter and created mind were alike unborn and
   even space was not--God, the great I Am, was as perfect, glorious and
   blessed as He is now. There was no sun and yet Jehovah dwelt in light
   ineffable. There was no earth and yet His Throne stood fast and firm.
   There were no heavens and yet His Glory was unbounded.

   God inhabited eternity in the infinite majesty and happiness of His
   self-contained greatness. If the Lord, thus abiding in awful solitude,
   should choose to create anything, the first thought and idea must come
   of Him, for there was no other to think or suggest. All things must be
   of Him in design. With whom can He take counsel? Who shall instruct
   Him? There existed not another to come into the council chamber, even
   if such an assistance could be supposed with the Most High.

   In the beginning of His way before His works of old, eternal Wisdom
   brought forth from its own mind the perfect plan of future creations
   and every line and mark therein must clearly have been of the Lord
   alone. He ordained the pathway of every planet and the abode of every
   fixed star. He poured forth the sweet influences of the Pleiades and
   girt Orion with His hands. He appointed the bounds of the sea and
   settled the course of the winds. As to the earth, the Lord alone
   planned its foundations and stretched His line upon it. He formed in
   His own mind the mold of all His creatures and found for them a
   dwelling and a service.

   He appointed the degree of strength with which He would endow each
   creature, settled its months of life, its hour of death, its coming and
   its going. Divine Wisdom mapped this earth--its flowing rivers and
   foaming seas--the towering mountains and the laughing valleys. The
   Divine Architect fixed the gates of the morning and the doors of the
   shadow of death. Nothing could have been suggested by any other, for
   there was no other to suggest. It was in His power to have made a
   universe very different from this if He had so pleased. And that He has
   made it what it is must have been merely because, in His Wisdom and
   prudence, He saw fit to do so.

   There cannot be any reason why He should not have created a world from
   which sin should have been forever excluded. And that He suffered sin
   to enter into His creation must again be ascribed to His own infinite
   Sovereignty. Had He not known that He would be master over sin and out
   of evil evolve the noblest display of His own Glory, He had not
   permitted it to enter into the world--but, in sketching the whole
   history of the universe which He was about to create, He permitted even
   that black spot to defile His work--because He foreknew what songs of
   everlasting triumph would rise to Himself when, in streams of His own
   blood, Incarnate Deity should wash out the stain. It cannot be doubted
   that whatever may be the whole drama of history in Creation and
   Providence, there is a high and mysterious sense in which it is all of
   God.

   The sin is not God's, but the temporary permission of its existence
   formed part of the foreknown scheme and to our faith the intervention
   of moral evil and the purity of the Divine Character do neither of them
   diminish the force of our belief that the whole scope of history is of
   God in the fullest sense. When the plan was all laid down and the
   Almighty had ordered His purpose, this was not enough--mere arrangement
   would not create. "Through Him," as well as "of Him," must all things
   be. There was no raw material ready to the Creator's hand. He must
   create the universe out of nothing. He calls not for aid--He needs it
   not and besides, there is none to help Him. There is no rough matter
   which He may fashion between His palms and launch forth as stars.

   He did not need a mine of unquarried matter which He might melt and
   purify in the furnace of His power and then hammer out upon the anvil
   of His skill--no, there was nothing to begin with in that day of
   Jehovah's work--from the womb of Omnipotence all things must be born.
   He speaks and the heavens leap into existence! He speaks again and
   worlds are begotten with all the varied forms of life so fraught with
   Divine Wisdom and matchless skill. "Let there be light and there was
   light," was not the only time when God had spoken and when things that
   were not, were, for aforetime had He spoken and this rolling earth and
   yon blue heavens had blossomed out of nothingness.

   Through Him were all things--from the high archangel who sings His
   praises in celestial notes--down to the cricket chirping on the hearth.
   The same finger paints the rainbow and the wing of the butterfly. He
   who dyes the garments of evening in all the colors of Heaven has
   covered the kingcup with gold and lit up the glowworm's lamp. From
   yonder ponderous mountain piercing the clouds down to that minute grain
   of dust in the summer's threshing floor--all things are through Him.
   Let but God withdraw the emanations of His Divine power and everything
   would melt away as the foam upon the sea melts into the wave which bore
   it!

   Nothing could stand an instant if the Divine foundation were removed.
   If He should shake the pillars of the world the whole temple of
   Creation falls to ruin and its very dust is blown away. A dreary waste,
   a silent emptiness, a voiceless wilderness is all which remains if God
   withdraws His power. No, even so much as this were not if His power
   should be withheld. That nature that is as it is, is through the energy
   of the present God. If the sun rises every morning and the moon walks
   in her brightness at night, it is through Him. Away with those men who
   think that God has wound up the world as though it were a clock and has
   gone away--leaving it to work for itself apart from His present hand!

   God is present everywhere--not merely present when we tremble because
   His thunder shakes the solid earth and sets the heavens in a blaze with
   lightning--but just as much so in the calm summer's eve when the air so
   gently fans the flowers and gnats dance up and down in the last gleams
   of sunlight. Men try to forget the Divine Presence by calling its
   energy by strange names. They speak of the power of gravitation. But
   what is the power of gravitation? We know what it does, but what is it?
   Gravitation is God's own power!

   They tell us of mysterious laws of electricity and I know not what. We
   know the laws, and let them wear the names they have. But laws cannot
   operate without power. What is the force of nature? It is a constant
   emanation from the great Fountain of power, the constant out-flowing of
   God Himself--the perpetual going forth of beams of light from Him who
   is "the great Father of Lights, with whom is no variableness, neither
   shadow." Tread softly, be reverent, for God is here, O Mortal, as truly
   as He is in Heaven! Wherever you are and whatever you look upon, you
   are in God's workshop where every wheel is turned by His hands.
   Everything is not God, but God is in everything and nothing works, or
   even exists, except by His present power and might. "Of Him and through
   Him are all things."

   Beloved, the great glory of all is that in the work of Creation
   everything is to Him. Everything will praise the Lord--He so designed
   it. God must have the highest motive and there can be no higher motive
   conceivable than His own Glory. When there was no creature but Himself
   and no being but Himself, God could not have taken as a motive a
   creature which did not exist. His motive must be Himself. His own Glory
   is His highest aim. The good of His creatures He considers carefully.
   But even the good of His creatures is but a means to the main end--the
   promotion of His Glory. All things, then, are for His pleasure and for
   His Glory they daily work.

   Tell me that the world is marred by sin and I lament it. Tell me that
   the slime of the serpent is upon everything beautiful here and I sorrow
   for it. But yet, even yet shall everything speak of the Glory of God.
   To Him are all things and the day shall come when with eyes spiritually
   illuminated you and I shall see that even the introduction of the Fall
   and the curse did not, after all, mar the splendor of the majesty of
   the Most High. To Him shall all things be. His enemies shall bow their
   necks unwillingly but abjectly, while His people, redeemed from death
   and Hell, shall cheerfully extol Him.

   The new heavens and the new earth shall ring with His praise and we who
   shall sit down to read the record of His creating wonders, shall say of
   them all, "In His temple does everyone speak of His Glory and even
   until now to Him have all things been." Courage then, Beloved! When you
   think that matters go against the cause of God, throw yourselves back
   upon this as a soft couch. When the enemy hisses in your ears this
   note--"God is overcome! His plans are spoiled. His Gospel is thrust
   back. The honor of His Son is stained," tell the enemy, "No, it is not
   so! To Him are all things."

   God's defeats are victories. God's weakness is stronger than man and
   even the foolishness of the Most High is wiser than man's wisdom and at
   the last we shall see most clearly that it is so. Hallelujah! We shall
   see, dear Friends, one day in the clear light of Heaven, that every
   page in human history, however stained by human sin, has nevertheless
   something of God's Glory in it. And that the calamities of nations, the
   falling of dynasties, the devastations of pestilence, plagues, famines,
   wars and earthquakes have all worked out the eternal purpose and
   glorified the Most High!

   From the first human prayer to the last mortal sigh! From the first
   note of finite praise onward to the everlasting hallelujah all things
   have worked together for the Glory of God and have served His purposes.
   All things are of Him and through Him and to Him. This great principle
   is most manifest in the grand work of Divine Grace. Here everything is
   of God and through God and to God. The great plan of salvation was not
   drawn by human fingers. It is no concoction of priests, no elaboration
   of Divines. Grace first moved the heart of God and joined with Divine
   Sovereignty to ordain a plan of salvation.

   This plan was the offspring of a Wisdom no less than Divine. None but
   God could have imagined a way of salvation such as that which the
   Gospel presents--a way so just to God--so safe to man. The thought of
   Divine Substitution and the Sacrifice of God on man's behalf could
   never have suggested itself to the most educated of all God's
   creatures. God Himself suggests it and the plan is "of Him." And as the
   great plan is of Him, so the fillings up of the details are of Him. God
   ordained the time when the first promise should be promulgated--who
   should receive that promise and who should deliver it. He ordained the
   hour when the great Promise-Keeper should come--when Jesus Christ
   should appear--of whom He should be born, by whom He should be
   betrayed, what death He should die, when He should rise and in what
   manner He should ascend.

   What if I say more? He ordained those who should accept the Mediator,
   to whom the Gospel should be preached and who should be the favored
   individuals in whom effectual calling should make that preaching mighty
   for salvation! He settled in His own mind the name of every one of His
   chosen and the time when each elect vessel should be put upon the wheel
   to be fashioned according to His will. He ordained pangs of conviction
   should be felt when the time of faith should come! How much of holy
   light and enjoyment should be bestowed--all this was purposed from of
   old! He settled how long the chosen vessel should be glazing in the
   fire and when it should be taken up--made perfect by heavenly
   workmanship to adorn the palace of God Most High. Of the Lord's Wisdom
   every stitch in the noble tapestry of salvation most surely comes.

   Nor must we stop here--through Him all these things come. Through His
   Spirit the promise came at last, for He moved the seers and holy men of
   old. Through Him the Son of God is born of the Virgin Mary by the power
   of the Holy Spirit. Through Him, sustained by that Spirit, the Son of
   God leads His thirty years of perfection. In the great redemption God
   alone is exalted. Jesus sweats in Gethsemane and bleeds on Calvary.
   None stood with our Savior there. He trod that winepress alone. His own
   arm worked salvation and His own arm upheld Him. Redemption work was
   through God alone! Not one soul was ever redeemed by human suffering!
   No spirit was emancipated by mortal penance. All is through Him.

   And as through Him the Atonement, so through Him the application of the
   Atonement. By the power of the Spirit the Gospel is daily preached.
   Upheld by the Holy Spirit, pastors, teachers and elders still abide
   with the Church--still the energy of the Spirit goes forth with the
   Word to the hearts of the chosen. Still is "Christ crucified," the
   power of God and the wisdom of God because God is in the Word and
   through Him men are called, converted, saved. O my Brethren, beyond a
   doubt we must confess of this great plan of salvation that it is all to
   Him! We have not a note of praise to spare for another!

   Silenced forever with everlasting confusion is the man who would retain
   a solitary word of praise for man or angel in the work of Grace. You
   fools! Who can be praised but God, for who but God determined to give
   His Son Jesus? You knaves! Will you rob Christ of His Glory? Will you
   steal the jewels out of His crown when He so dearly bought them with
   drops of His precious blood? O you who love darkness rather than light,
   will you glorify man's will above the energy of the Holy Spirit and
   sacrifice to your own dignity and freedom? God forgive you!

   But as for His saints, they will always sing, "To God, to God alone be
   all the Glory! From the first to the last let Him who is the Alpha and
   the Omega have all the praise! Let His name be extolled, world without
   end." When the great plan of Grace shall be all developed and you and I
   shall stand upon the hilltops of Glory, what a wondrous scene will open
   up before us! We shall see more clearly then, than now, how all things
   sprang from the fountainhead of God's love. How they all flowed through
   the channel of the Savior's mediation and how they all worked together
   to the Glory of the same God from whom they came. The great plan of
   Grace, then, bears out this principle.

   The word holds good, dear Friends, in the case of every individual
   Believer. Let this be a matter for personal enquiry. Why am I saved?
   Because of any goodness in me, or any superiority in my constitution?
   Of whom comes my salvation? My spirit cannot hesitate a single moment.
   How could a new heart come out of the old one? Who can bring a clean
   thing out of an unclean? Not one! How can the spirit come out of the
   flesh? That which is born of the flesh is flesh. If it is spirit it
   must be born of the Spirit. My Soul, you must be quite clear about
   this, that if there is in you any faith, hope, or spiritual life, it
   must have come of God!

   Can any Christian here who possesses vital godliness differ from this
   statement? I am persuaded he cannot. And if any man should arrogate any
   honor to his own natural constitution, I must, with all charity, doubt
   whether he knows anything at all about the matter. But, my Soul, as
   your salvation must have come out of God--as He must have thought of it
   and planned it for you, and then bestowed it upon you--did it not also
   come to you through God? It came through faith, but where did that
   faith take its birth? Was it not of the operation of the Holy Spirit?
   And what did you believe in? Did you believe in your own strength, or
   in your own good resolution? No, but in Jesus, your Lord. Was not the
   first ray of light you ever had received in this way?

   Did you not look entirely away from self to the Savior? And the Light
   which you now have, does it not always come to you in the same way, by
   having done once and for all with the creature, with the flesh, with
   human merit--and resting with childlike confidence upon the finished
   work and righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ? Is not, dear Hearer,
   is not your salvation, if you are, indeed, saved, entirely "through"
   your God, as well as "of" your God? Who is it that enables you to pray
   every day? Who keeps you from temptation? By what Grace are you led
   onward in spiritual duty? Who upholds you when your foot would trip?
   Are you not conscious that there is a power other than your own?

   For my part, Brethren, I am not taken to Heaven against my will, I
   know, but still so desperate is my nature and so prone to evil that I
   feel myself floated onward against the current of my nature. It seems
   as if all we could do were to kick and rebel against Sovereign Grace,
   while Sovereign Grace says, "I will save you. I will have you, whatever
   you may do. I will overcome your raging corruption. I will quicken you
   out of your lethargy and take you to Heaven in a fiery chariot of
   afflictions, if not by any other means. I will whip you to Paradise
   sooner than let you be lost."

   Is not this your experience? Have you not found that if once the strong
   hand of God were taken from your soul, instead of going onward to
   Heaven you would go back again to Perdition? It is through God you are
   saved! And what do you say, Believer, to the last point? Is it not "to
   Him"? Will you take one single jewel out of His crown? Oh, there is not
   one of you who would wish to extol himself! There is no song we sing
   more sweetly in this House of Prayer than the song of Grace and there
   is no hymn which seems more in keeping with our own experience than
   this--

   "Grace all the work shall crown,
   Through everlasting days.
   It lays in Hea ven the topmost stone,
   And well deserves the praise."

   Let who will extol the dignity of the creature. Let who may boast in
   the power of free will--we cannot do it! We have found our nature to be
   a very depraved one and our will to be under bondage. We must, if other
   creatures do not, extol that unchangeable Omnipotent Grace which has
   made us what we are and will continue to keep us so till it brings us
   to the right hand of God in everlasting Glory! In each individual,
   then, this rule holds good.

   Once more, in every work which the Christian is enabled to do, he
   should bear in mind the rule of the text. Some of you are privileged to
   work in the Sunday school and you have had many conversions in your
   class. Others of you are distributing tracts, going from house to house
   and trying to bring souls to Christ, not without success, by God's
   Grace. Some of us, too, have the honor of being sent to preach the
   Gospel in every place and we have sheaves of our harvest too many for
   our barns to hold. In the case of some of us, we seem to have received
   the promised blessing to its fullest extent. The Lord has spiritually
   made our children like the sand of the sea and the spiritual offspring
   of our heart like the gravel.

   In all this it behooves us to remember that, "of Him and through Him
   and to Him," are all things. "Of Him." Who makes you to differ? What
   have you which you have not received? The burning heart, the tearful
   eye, the prayerful soul--all these qualifications for usefulness come
   of Him. The fluent mouth, the pleading tongue--these must have been
   educated and given by Him. From Him all the many gifts of the Spirit by
   which the Church is edified--from Him, I say, they all proceed. What is
   Paul? Who is Apollos, or Cephas--who are all these but the messengers
   of God in whom the Spirit works, dividing to every man according as He
   wills?

   When the preacher has achieved his usefulness, he knows that all his
   success comes through God. If a man shall suppose himself capable of
   stirring up a revival, or encouraging even one saint, or leading one
   sinner to repentance, he is a fool! As well might we attempt to move
   the stars, or shake the world, or grasp the lightning flash in the
   hollow of our hand as think to save a soul, or even to quicken saints
   out of their lethargy! Spiritual work must be done by the Spirit.
   Through God every good thing comes to us. The preacher may be a very
   Samson when God is with him--he shall be like Samson when God is not
   with him only in Samson's degradation and shame!

   Beloved, there never was a man brought to God except through God and
   there never will be! Our nation shall never be stirred up again into
   the celestial heat of piety except by the Presence of the Holy Spirit
   anew. Would God we had more of the abiding sense of the Spirit's work
   among us! That we looked more to Him! That we rested less in machinery
   and men and more upon that Divine but Invisible Agent who works all
   good things in the hearts of men! Beloved, it is through GOD that every
   good thing comes. And I am sure it is to Him. We cannot take the honor
   of a single convert. We do look with thankfulness upon this growing
   Church, but we can give the Glory alone to Him! Give glory to the
   creature and it is all over with it! Honor yourselves as a Church and
   God will soon dishonor you!

   Let us lay every sheaf upon His altar, bring every lamb of the fold to
   the feet of the Good Shepherd feeling that it is His. When we go abroad
   to fish for souls, let us think that we only fill the net because He
   taught us how to throw it on the right side of the Church. And when we
   take them they are His, not ours. Oh, what poor little things we are
   and yet we think we do so much! The pen might say, "I wrote Milton's
   Paradise Lost." Ah, poor Pen! You could not have made a dot to an "i,"
   or a cross to a "t," if Milton's hand had not moved you! The preacher
   could do nothing if God had not helped him. The axe might cry, "I have
   felled forests! I have made the cedar bow its head and laid the
   stalwart oak in the dust." No, you did not--for if it had not been for
   the arm which wielded you, even a bramble would have been too much for
   you to cut down!

   Shall the sword say, "I won the victory! I shed the blood of the
   mighty! I caused the shield to be cast away?" No, it was the warrior,
   who with his courage and might made you of service in the battle, and
   apart from this you are less than nothing. In all that God does by us
   let us continue to give Him the praise--so shall He continue His
   Presence with our efforts. Otherwise He will take from us His smile and
   so we shall be left as weak men. I have, perhaps, at too great length
   for your patience, tried to bring out this very simple but very useful
   principle. And now, before I go to the second part, I wish to apply it
   by this very practical remark.

   Beloved, if this is true, that all things are through Him and to Him,
   do you not think that those doctrines are most likely to be correct and
   most worthy to be held which are most in keeping with this Truth of
   God? Now, there are certain doctrines commonly called Calvinistic (but
   which ought never to have been called by such a name, for they are
   simply Christian doctrines), which I think commend themselves to the
   minds of all thoughtful persons. For this reason, mainly, that they do
   ascribe to God everything.

   Here is the doctrine of election, for instance. Why is a man saved? Is
   it the result of his own will or God's will? Did he choose God, or did
   God choose him? The answer, "Man chose God," is manifestly untrue
   because it glorifies man. God's answer to it is, "You have not chosen
   Me, but I have chosen you." God has predestinated His people to
   salvation from before the foundation of the world. Ascribing the will,
   which is the hinge of the whole matter, and turns the
   balance--ascribing that to God--we feel we are speaking in keeping with
   the doctrine of our text.

   Then take effectual calling. By what power is a man called? There are
   some who say that it is by the energy of his own will, or at least that
   while God gives him Grace, it depends upon him to make use of it. Some
   do not make use of the Grace and perish. Others make use of the Grace
   and are saved--saved by their own consenting to allow Grace to be
   effectual. We, on the other hand, say no--a man is not saved against
   his will--but he is made willing by the operation of the Holy Spirit. A
   mighty Grace which he does not wish to resist enters into the man,
   disarms him, makes a new creature of him and he is saved. We believe
   that the calling which saves the soul is a calling which owes nothing
   at all to man, but which comes from God. The creature being, then,
   passive, while God, like the potter, molds the man like a lump of clay.
   Clearly the calling, we think, must be through God--for so it coincides
   with this principle, "of Him and through Him and to Him are all
   things."

   Then next, the question of particular redemption. Some insist upon it
   that men are redeemed not because Christ died, but because they are
   willing to give efficacy to the blood of Christ. He died for everybody
   according to their theory. Why, then, are not all men saved? Because
   all men will not believe? That is to say that believing is necessary in
   order to make the blood of Christ efficacious for redemption! Now we
   hold that to be a great lie! We believe the very contrary-- namely,
   that the blood of Christ has in itself the power to redeem and that it
   does redeem and that faith does not give efficacy to the blood but is
   only the proof that the blood has redeemed that man. Hence we hold that
   Christ did not redeem every man, but only redeemed those men who will
   ultimately attain unto eternal life.

   We do not believe that He redeemed the damned! We do not believe that
   He poured out His life blood for souls already in Hell! We never can
   imagine that Christ suffered in the place of all men and that then,
   afterwards, these same men have to suffer for themselves--that in fact
   Christ pays their debts--and then God makes them pay their debts over
   again! We think that the doctrine that men, by their wills, give
   efficacy to the blood of Christ is derogatory to the Lord Jesus and we
   rather hold to this that He laid down His life for His sheep and that
   His laying down His life for His sheep involved and secured the
   salvation of every one of them. We believe this because we hold that,
   "of Him and through Him and to Him are all things."

   So, again, take the total depravity of the race and its original
   corruption--a doctrine much abhorred of those who lift up poor human
   nature--but is, nevertheless, true. We hold that man must be entirely
   lost and ruined, because if there is some good thing in him, then it
   cannot be said that, "of God and through God and to God, are all
   things," for at least some things must be of man. If there are some
   relics of virtue and some remnants of power left in the race of man,
   then some things are of man and to man will some things be. But if of
   God are all things, then in man there must be nothing--man must be set
   down as ruined--hopelessly ruined--

   "Bruised and mangled by the Fall," and his salvation must be described
   as being from the first to the last, in every jot and every tittle of
   that almighty Grace of God, which at first chose him, at length
   redeemed him, ultimately called him, constantly preserved him and
   perfectly shall present him before the Father's Throne.

   I put these doctrines before you, more especially today, because last
   Friday many Believers both in Geneva and London met together to
   celebrate the centenary of the death of that mighty servant of God,
   John Calvin. I honor Calvin, not as teaching these doctrines himself,
   but as one through whom God spoke and one who, next to the Apostle
   Paul, propounded the Truth of God more clearly than any other man that
   ever breathed. He knew more of Scripture and explained it more clearly
   than most. Luther may have as much courage, but Luther knows little of
   theology. Luther, like a bull, when he sees one Truth, shuts his eyes
   and dashes against the enemy, breaking down gates, bolts and bars, to
   clear away for the Word!

   But Calvin, following in the opened pathway with clear eyes, searching
   Scripture, ever acknowledging that of God and through God and to God
   are all things, maps out the whole plan with a delightful clearness
   which could only have come of the Spirit of God. That man of God
   expounds the doctrines in so excellent and admirable a manner that we
   cannot too much bless the Lord who sent him, or too much pray that
   others like him may be honest and sincere in the work of the Lord. Thus
   much then, of doctrine, but one or two minutes by way of devotion.

   II. The Apostle puts his pen back into the ink bottle, falls on his
   knees--he cannot help it--he must have a doxol-ogy. "To whom be glory
   forever. Amen." Beloved, let us imitate this DEVOTION. I think that
   this sentence should be the prayer, the motto for every one of us--"To
   Him be glory forever. Amen." I will be but very brief, for I would not
   weary you. "To Him be glory forever." This should be the single desire
   of the Christian. I take it that he should not have twenty wishes, but
   only one. He may desire to see his family well brought up, but only
   that, "To God may be glory forever."

   He may wish for prosperity in his business, but only so far as it may
   help him to promote this--"To Him be glory forever." He may desire to
   attain more gifts and more graces, but it should only be that, "To Him
   may be glory forever." This one thing I know, Christian--you are not
   acting as you ought to do when you are moved by any other motive than
   the one motive of your Lord's Glory. As a Christian you are "of God and
   through God." I pray you be "to God." Let nothing ever set your heart
   beating but love to Him. Let this ambition fire your soul! Be this the
   foundation of every enterprise upon which you enter, and this your
   sustaining motive whenever your zeal would grow chill--only, only make
   God your object! Depend upon it, where self begins, sorrow begins. But
   if God is my supreme delight and only object--

   "To me 'tis equal whether love ordain My life or death appoint me ease
   or pain."

   To me there shall be no choice, when my eyes singly look to God's
   Glory, whether I shall be torn in pieces by wild beasts or live in
   comfort--whether I shall be full of despondency or full of hope. If God
   is glorified in my mortal body, my soul shall rest content. Again, let
   it be our constant desire, "To Him be glory." When I wake up in the
   morning, O, let my soul salute her God with gratitude--

   "Wake and lift up yourself, my Heart, And with the angels bear your
   part, Who all night long unwearied sing High praises to the eternal
   King." At my work behind the counter, or in the Exchange, let me be
   looking out to see how I may glorify Him. If I am walking in the
   fields, let my desire be that the trees may clap their hands in His
   praise. May the sun in his march shine out the Master's Glory and the
   stars at night reflect His praise.

   It is yours, Brethren, to put a tongue into the mouth of this dumb
   world and make the silent beauties of creation praise their God. Never
   be silent when there are opportunities and you shall never be silent
   for want of opportunities. At night fall asleep praising your God! As
   you close your eyes let your last thought be, "How sweet to rest upon
   the Savior's bosom!" In afflictions praise Him--out of the fires let
   your song go up! On the sick-bed extol Him! Dying, let Him have your
   sweetest notes. Let your shouts of victory in the combat with the last
   great enemy be all for Him. And then, when you have burst the bondage
   of mortality and come into the freedom of immortal spirits--then, in a
   nobler, sweeter song--you shall sing unto His praise!

   Be this, then, your constant thought--"To Him be glory forever." Let
   this be your earnest thought. Do not speak of God's Glory with cold
   words, nor think of it with a chilly heart, but feel, "I must praise
   Him. If I cannot praise Him where I am, I will break through these
   narrow bonds, and get where I can." Sometimes you will feel that you
   long to be disembodied--that you may praise Him as the immortal spirits
   do. I must praise Him! Bought by His precious blood, called by His
   Spirit I cannot hold my tongue! My Soul, can you be dumb and dead? I
   must praise Him! Stand back, O Flesh! Away, you Fiends! Away, you
   Troubles! I must sing, for should I refuse to sing, surely the very
   stones would speak!

   I hope, dear Friends, while thus earnest, your praise will also be
   growing. Let there be growing desire to praise Him of whom and through
   whom are all things. You blessed Him in your youth, do not be content
   with such praises as you gave Him then. Has God prospered you in
   business? Give Him more as He has given you more. Has God given you
   experience? O, praise Him by better faith than you exercised at first.
   Does your knowledge grow? Oh, then you can sing more sweetly! Do you
   have happier times than you once had? Have you been restored from
   sickness and has your sorrow been turned into peace and joy? Then give
   Him more music! Put more coals in your censer, more sweet frankincense,
   more of the sweet cane bought with money. Oh, to serve Him every day,
   lifting up my heart from Sunday to Sunday, till I reach the ever-ending
   Sunday! Reaching from sanctification to sanctification, from love to
   love, from strength to strength, till I appear before my God!

   In closing, let me urge you to make this desire practical. If you
   really glorify God, take care to do it not with lip-service which dies
   away in the wind, but with solid homage of daily life. Praise Him by
   your patience in pain, by your perseverance in duty, by your generosity
   in His cause, by your boldness in testimony, by your consecration to
   His work. Praise Him, my dear Friends, not only this morning in what
   you do for Him in your offerings, but praise Him every day by doing
   something for God in all sorts of ways, according to the manner in
   which He has been pleased to bless you. I wish I could have spoken
   worthily on such a topic as this, but a dull, heavy headache sits upon
   me and I feel that a thick gloom overshadows my words, out of which I
   look with longing, but cannot rise.

   For this I may well grieve, but nevertheless God the Holy Spirit can
   work the better through our weakness and if you will try and preach the
   sermon to yourselves, my Brethren, you will do it vastly better than I
   can. If you will meditate upon this text this afternoon, "Of Him and
   through Him and to Him, are all things," I am sure you will be led to
   fall on your knees with the Apostle and say, "To Him be glory forever,"
   and then you will rise up and practically, in your life, give Him
   honor, putting the "Amen" to this doxology by your own individual
   service of your great and gracious Lord. May He give a blessing now and
   accept your thank offering through Christ Jesus. Amen.

                             Baptismal Regeneration

   A Sermon

   (No. 573)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, June 5th, 1864, by the

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel
   to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved;
   but he that believeth not shall be damned."--Mark 16:15-16.

   IN the preceding verse our Lord Jesus Christ gives us some little
   insight into the natural character of the apostles whom he selected to
   be the first ministers of the Word. They were evidently men of like
   passions with us, and needed to be rebuked even as we do. On the
   occasion when our Lord sent forth the eleven to preach the gospel to
   every creature, he "appeared unto them as they sat at meat, and
   upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they
   believed not them which had seen him after he was risen;" from which we
   may surely gather that to peach the Word, the Lord was pleased to
   choose imperfect men; men, too, who of themselves were very weak in the
   grace of faith in which it was most important that they should excel.
   Faith is the conquering grace, and is of all things the main requisite
   in the preacher of the Word; and yet the honoured men who were chosen
   to be the leaders of the divine crusade needed a rebuke concerning
   their unbelief. Why was this? Why, my brethren, because the Lord has
   ordained evermore that we should have this treasure in earthen vessels,
   that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us. If you
   should find a perfect minister, then might the praise and honour of his
   usefulness accrue to man; but God is frequently pleased to select for
   eminent usefulness men evidently honest and sincere, but who have some
   manifest infirmity by which all the glory is cast off from them and
   laid upon Himself, and upon Himself alone. Let it never be supposed
   that we who are God's ministers either excuse our faults or pretend to
   perfection. We labour to walk in holiness, but we cannot claim to be
   all that we wish to be. We do not base the claims of God's truth upon
   the spotlessness of our characters, but upon the fact that it comes
   from him. You have believed in spite of our infirmities, and not
   because of our virtues; if, indeed, you had believed our word because
   of our supposed perfection, your faith would stand in the excellency of
   man and not in the power of God. We come unto you often with much
   trembling, sorrowing over our follies and weaknesses, but we deliver to
   you God's Word as God's Word, and we beseech you to receive it not as
   coming from us poor, sinful mortals, but as proceeding from the Eternal
   and Thrice Holy God; and if you so receive it, and by its own vital
   force are moved and stirred up towards God and his ways, then is the
   work of the Word sure work, which it could not and would not be if it
   rested in any way upon man.

   Our Lord having thus given us an insight into the character of the
   persons whom he has chosen to proclaim his truth, then goes on to
   deliver to the chosen champions, their commission for the Holy War. I
   pray you mark the words with solemn care. He sums up in a few words the
   whole of their work, and at the same time foretells the result of it,
   telling them that some would doubtless believe and so be saved, and
   some on the other hand would not believe and would most certainly,
   therefore, be damned, that is, condemned for ever to the penalties of
   God's wrath. The lines containing the commission of our ascended Lord
   are certainly of the utmost importance, and demand devout attention and
   implicit obedience, not only from all who aspire to the work of the
   ministry, but also from all who hear the message of mercy. A clear
   understanding of these words is absolutely necessary to our success in
   our Master's work, for if we do not understand the commission it is not
   at all likely that we shall discharge it aright. To alter these words
   were more than impertinence, it would involve the crime of treason
   against the authority of Christ and the best interests of the souls of
   men. O for grace to be very jealous here.

   Wherever the apostles went they met with obstacles to the preaching of
   the gospel, and the more open and effectual was the door of utterance
   the more numerous were the adversaries. These brave men who wielded the
   sword of the Spirit as to put to flight all their foes; and this they
   did not by craft and guile, but by making a direct cut at the error
   which impeded them. Never did they dream for a moment of adapting the
   gospel to the unhallowed tastes or prejudices of the people, but at
   once directly and boldly they brought down with both their hands the
   mighty sword of the Spirit upon the crown of the opposing error. This
   morning, in the name of the Lord of Hosts, my Helper and Defense, I
   shall attempt to do the same; and if I should provoke some
   hostility--if I should through speaking what I believe to be the truth
   lose the friendship of some and stir up the enmity of more, I cannot
   help it. The burden of the Lord is upon me, and I must deliver my soul.
   I have been loath enough to undertake the work, but I am forced to it
   by an awful and overwhelming sense of solemn duty. As I am soon to
   appear before my Master's bar, I will this day, if ever in my life,
   bear my testimony for truth, and run all risks. I am content to be cast
   out as evil if it must be so, but I cannot, I dare not, hold my peace.
   The Lord knoweth I have nothing in my heart but the purest love to the
   souls of those whom I feel imperatively called to rebuke sternly in the
   Lord's name. Among my hearers and readers, a considerable number will
   censure if not condemn me, but I cannot help it. If I forfeit your love
   for truth's sake I am grieved for you, but I cannot, I dare not, do
   otherwise. It is as much as my soul is worth to hold my peace any
   longer, and whether you approve or not I must speak out. Did I ever
   court your approbation? It is sweet to everyone to be applauded; but if
   for the sake of the comforts of respectability and the smiles of men
   any Christian minister shall keep back a part of his testimony, his
   Master at the last shall require it at his hands. This day, standing in
   the immediate presence of God, I shall speak honestly what I feel, as
   the Holy Spirit shall enable me; and I shall leave the matter with you
   to judge concerning it, as you will answer for that judgment at the
   last great day.

   I find that the great error which w e have to contend with throughout
   England (and it is growing more and more), is one in direct opposition
   to my text, well known to you as the doctrine of baptismal
   regeneration. We will confront this dogma with the assertion, that
   BAPTISM WITHOUT FAITH SAVES NO ONE. The text says, "He that believeth
   and is baptized shall be saved;" but whether a man be baptized or no,
   it asserts that "he that believeth not shall be damned:" so that
   baptism does not save the unbeliever , nay, it does not in any degree
   exempt him from the common doom of all the ungodly. He may have
   baptism, or he may not have baptism, but if he believeth not, he shall
   be in any case most surely damned. Let him be baptized by immersion or
   sprinkling, in his infancy, or in his adult age, if he be not led to
   put his trust in Jesus Christ--if he remaineth an unbeliever, then this
   terrible doom is pronounced upon him--"He that believeth not shall be
   damned." I am not aware that any Protestant Church in England teaches
   the doctrine of baptismal regeneration except one, and that happens to
   be the corporation which with none too much humility calls itself the
   Church of England. This very powerful sect does not teach this doctrine
   merely through a section of its ministers, who might charitably be
   considered as evil branches of the vine, but it openly, boldly, and
   plainly declares this doctrine in her own appointed standard, the Book
   of Common Prayer, and that in words so express, that while language is
   the channel of conveying intelligible sense, no process short of
   violent wresting from their plain meaning can ever make them say
   anything else.

   Here are the words: we quote them from the Catechism which is intended
   for the instruction of youth, and is naturally very plain and simple,
   since it would be foolish to trouble the young with metaphysical
   refinements. The child is asked its name, and then questioned, "Who
   gave you this name?" "My godfathers and godmothers in my baptism;
   wherein I was made a member of Christ, the child of God, and an
   inheritor of the kingdom of heaven." Is not this definite and plain
   enough? I prize the words for their candour; they could not speak more
   plainly. Three times over the thing is put, lest there should be any
   doubt in it. The word regeneration may, by some sort of juggling, be
   made to mean something else, but here there can be no misunderstanding.
   The child is not only made "a member of Christ"--union to Jesus is no
   mean spiritual gift--but he is made in baptism "the child of God" also;
   and, since the rule is, "if children then heirs," he is also made "an
   inheritor of the kingdom of heaven." Nothing can be more plain. I
   venture to say that while honesty remains on earth the meaning of these
   words will not admit of dispute. It is clear as noon day that, as the
   Rubric hath it, "Fathers, mothers, masters, and dames, are to cause
   their children, servants, and apprentices," no matter how idle, giddy,
   or wicked they may be, to learn the Catechism, and to say that in
   baptism they were made members of Christ and children of God. The form
   for the administration of this baptism is scarcely less plain and
   outspoken, seeing that thanks are expressly returned unto Almighty God,
   because the person baptized is regenerate. "Then shall the priest say,
   Seeing now, dearly beloved brethren, that this child is regenerate and
   grafted into the body of Christ's Church, let us give thanks unto
   Almighty God for these benefits; and with one accord make our prayers
   unto him, that this child may lead the rest of his life according to
   this beginning.'" Nor is this all, for to leave no mistake, we have the
   words of the thanksgiving prescribed, "Then shall the priest say, We
   yield thee hearty thanks, most merciful Father, that it hath pleased
   thee to regenerate this infant with thy Holy Spirit, to receive him for
   thine own child by adoption, and to incorporate him into thy holy
   Church.'"

   This, then, is the clear and unmistakable teaching of a Church calling
   itself Protestant. I am not now dealing at all with the question of
   infant baptism: I have nothing to do with that this morning. I am now
   considering the question of baptismal regeneration, whether in adults
   or infants, or ascribed to sprinkling, pouring, or immersion. Here is a
   Church which teaches every Lord's day in the Sunday-school, and should,
   according to the Rubric, teach openly in the Church, all children that
   they were made members of Christ, children of God, and inheritors of
   the kingdom of heaven when they were baptized! Here is a professedly
   Protestant Church, which, every time its minister goes to the font,
   declares that every person there receiving baptism is there and then
   "regenerated and grafted into the body of Christ's Church."

   "But," I hear many good people exclaim, "there are many good clergymen
   in the Church who do not believe in baptismal regeneration." To this my
   answer is prompt. Why then do they belong to a Church which teaches
   that doctrine in the plainest terms? I am told that many in the Church
   of England preach against her own teaching. I know they do, and herein
   I rejoice in their enlightenment, but I question, gravely question
   their morality. To take oath that I sincerely assent and consent to a
   doctrine which I do not believe, would to my conscience appear little
   short of perjury, if not absolute downright perjury; but those who do
   so must be judged by their own Lord. For me to take money for defending
   what I do not believe--for me to take the money of a Church, and then
   to preach against what are most evidently its doctrines--I say for me
   to do this (I judge others as I would that they should judge me) for
   me, or for any other simple, honest man to do so, were an atrocity so
   great, that if I had perpetrated the deed, I should consider myself out
   of the pale of truthfulness, honesty, and common morality. Sirs, when I
   accepted the office of minister of this congregation, I looked to see
   what were your articles of faith; if I had not believed them I should
   not have accepted your call, and when I change my opinions, rest
   assured that as an honest man I shall resign the office, for how could
   I profess one thing in your declaration of faith, and quite another
   thing in my own preaching? Would I accept your pay, and then stand up
   every Sabbath-day and talk against the doctrines of your standards? For
   clergymen to swear or say that they give their solemn assent and
   consent to what they do not believe is one of the grossest pieces of
   immorality perpetrated in England, and is most pestilential in its
   influence, since it directly teaches men to lie whenever it seems
   necessary to do so in order to get a living or increase their supposed
   usefulness: it is in fact an open testimony from priestly lips that at
   least in ecclesiastical matters falsehood may express truth, and truth
   itself is a mere unimportant nonentity. I know of nothing more
   calculated to debauch the public mind than a want of
   straightforwardness in ministers; and when worldly men hear ministers
   denouncing the very things which their own Prayer Book teaches, they
   imagine that words have no meaning among ecclesiastics, and that vital
   differences in religion are merely a matter of tweedle-dee and
   tweedle-dum, and that it does not much matter what a man does believe
   so long as he is charitable towards other people. If baptism does
   regenerate people, let the fact be preached with a trumpet tongue, and
   let no man be ashamed of his belief in it. If this be really their
   creed, by all means let them have full liberty for its propagation. My
   brethren, those are honest Churchmen in this matter who, subscribing to
   the Prayer Book, believe in baptismal regeneration, and preach it
   plainly. God forbid that we should censure those who believe that
   baptism saves the soul, because they adhere to a Church which teaches
   the same doctrine. So far they are honest men; and in England, where
   else, let them never lack a full toleration. Let us oppose their
   teaching by all Scriptural and intelligent means, but let us respect
   their courage in plainly giving us their views. I hate their doctrine,
   but I love their honesty; and as they speak but what they believe to be
   true, let them speak it out, and the more clearly the better. Out with
   it, sirs, be it what it may, but do let us know what you mean. For my
   part, I love to stand foot to foot with an honest foeman. To open
   warfare, bold and true hearts raise no objection but the ground of
   quarrel; it is covert enmity which we have most cause to fear, and best
   reason to loathe. That crafty kindness which inveigles me to sacrifice
   principle is the serpent in the grass--deadly to the incautious
   wayfarer. Where union and friendship are not cemented by truth, they
   are an unhallowed confederacy. It is time that there should be an end
   put to the flirtations of honest men with those who believe one way and
   swear another. If men believe baptism works regeneration, let them say
   so; but if they do not so believe it in their hearts , and yet
   subscribe, and yet more, get their livings by subscribing to words
   asserting it, let them find congenial associates among men who can
   equivocate and shuffle, for honest men will neither ask nor accept
   their friendship.

   We ourselves are not dubious on this point, we protest that persons are
   not saved by being baptized. In such an audience as this, I am almost
   ashamed to go into the matter, because you surely know better than to
   be misled. Nevertheless, for the good of others we will drive at it. We
   hold that persons are not saved by baptism, for we think, first of all
   that it seems out of character with the spiritual religion which Christ
   came to teach, that he should make salvation depend upon mere ceremony.
   Judaism might possibly absorb the ceremony by way of type into her
   ordinances essential to eternal life; for it was religion of types and
   shadows. The false religions of the heathen might inculcate salvation
   by a physical process, but Jesus Christ claims for his faith that it is
   purely spiritual, and how could he connect regeneration with a peculiar
   application of aqueous fluid? I cannot see how it would be a spiritual
   gospel, but I can see how it would be mechanical, if I were sent forth
   to teach that the mere dropping of so many drops upon the brow, or even
   the plunging a person in water could save the soul. This seems to me to
   be the most mechanical religion now existing, and to be on a par with
   the praying windmills of Thibet, or the climbing up and down of
   Pilate's staircase to which Luther subjected himself in the days of his
   darkness. The operation of water-baptism does not appear even to my
   faith to touch the point involved in the regeneration of the soul. What
   is the necessary connection between water and the overcoming of sin? I
   cannot see any connection which can exist between sprinkling, or
   immersion, and regeneration, so that the one shall necessarily be tied
   to the other in the absence of faith. Used by faith, had God commanded
   it, miracles might be wrought; but without faith or even consciousness,
   as in the case of babes, how can spiritual benefits be connected
   necessarily with the sprinkling of water? If this be your teaching,
   that regeneration goes with baptism, I say it looks like the teaching
   of a spurious Church, which has craftily invented a mechanical
   salvation to deceive ignorant, sensual, and grovelling minds, rather
   than the teaching of the most profoundly spiritual of all teachers, who
   rebuked Scribes and Pharisees for regarding outward rites as more
   important than inward grace.

   But it strikes me that a more forcible argument is that the dogma is
   not supported by facts. Are all persons who are baptized children of
   God? Well, let us look at the divine family. Let us mark their
   resemblance to their glorious Parent! Am I untruthful if I say that
   thousands of those who were baptized in their infancy are now in our
   goals? You can ascertain the fact if you please, by application to
   prison authorities. Do you believe that these men, many of whom have
   been living by plunder, felony, burglary, or forgery, are regenerate?
   If so, the Lord deliver us from such regeneration. Are these villains
   members of Christ? If so, Christ has sadly altered since the day when
   he was holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners. Has he really
   taken baptized drunkards and harlots to be members of his body? Do you
   not revolt at the supposition? It is a well-known fact that baptized
   persons have been hanged. Surely it can hardly be right to hang the
   inheritors of the kingdom of heaven! Our sheriffs have much to answer
   for when they officiate at the execution of the children of God, and
   suspend the members of Christ on the gallows! What a detestable farce
   is that which is transacted at the open grave, when "a dear brother"
   who has died drunk is buried in a "sure and certain hope of the
   resurrection of eternal life," and the prayer that "when we shall
   depart this life we may rest in Christ, as our hope is that this our
   brother doth." Here is a regenerate brother, who having defiled the
   village by constant uncleanness and bestial drunkenness, died without a
   sign of repentance, and yet the professed minister of God solemnly
   accords him funeral rites which are denied to unbaptized innocents, and
   puts the reprobate into the earth in "sure and certain hope of the
   resurrection to eternal life." If old Rome in her worst days ever
   perpetrated a grosser piece of imposture than this, I do no read things
   aright; if it does not require a Luther to cry down this hypocrisy as
   much as Popery ever did, then I do not even know that twice two make
   four. Do we find--we who baptize on profession of faith, and baptize by
   immersion in a way which is confessed to be correct, though not allowed
   by some to be absolutely necessary to its validity--do we who baptize
   in the name of the sacred Trinity as others do, do we find that baptism
   regenerates? We do not. Neither in the righteous nor the wicked do we
   find regeneration wrought by baptism. We have never met with one
   believer, however instructed in divine things, who could trace his
   regeneration to his baptism; and on the other hand, we confess it with
   sorrow, but still with no surprise, that we have seen those whom we
   have ourselves baptized, according to apostolic precedent, go back into
   the world and wander into the foulest sin, and their baptism has
   scarcely been so much as a restraint to them, because they have not
   believed in the Lord Jesus Christ. Facts all show that whatever good
   there may be in baptism, it certainly does not make a man "a member of
   Christ, the child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven,"
   or else many thieves, whoremongers, drunkards, fornicators, and
   murderers, are members of Christ, the children of God, and inheritors
   of the kingdom of heaven. Facts, brethren, are against this Popish
   doctrine; and facts are stubborn things.

   Yet further, I am persuaded that the performance styled baptism by the
   Prayer Book is not at all likely to regenerate and save. How is the
   thing done? One is very curious to know when one hears of an operation
   which makes men member s of Christ, children of God, and inheritors of
   the kingdom of heaven, how the thing is done. It must in itself be a
   holy thing truthful in all its details, and edifying in every portion.
   Now, we will suppose we have a company gathered round the water, be it
   more or less, and the process of regeneration is about to be performed.
   We will suppose them all to be godly people. The clergyman officiating
   is a profound believer in the Lord Jesus, and the father and mother are
   exemplary Christians, and the godfathers and godmothers are all
   gracious persons. We will suppose this--it is a supposition fraught
   with charity, but it may be correct. What are these godly people
   supposed to say? Let us look to the Prayer Book. The clergyman is
   suppose to tell these people, "Ye have heard also that our Lord Jesus
   Christ hath promised in his gospel to grant all these things that ye
   have prayed for: which promise he, for his part, will most surely keep
   and perform. Wherefore, after this promise made by Christ, this infant
   must also faithfully, for his part, promise by you that are his
   sureties (until he come of age to take it upon himself) that he will
   renounce the devil and all his works, and constantly believe God's holy
   Word, and obediently keep his commandments." This small child is to
   promise to do this, or more truly others are to take upon themselves to
   promise, and even vow that he shall do so. But we must not break the
   quotation, and therefore let us return to the Book. "I demand
   therefore, dost thou, in the name of this child, renounce the devil and
   all his works, the vain pomp and glory of the world, with all covetous
   desires of the same, and the carnal desires of the flesh, so that thou
   wilt not follow, nor be led by them?" Answers "I renounce them all."
   That is to say, on the name and behalf of this tender infant about to
   be baptized, these godly people, these enlightened Christian people,
   these who know better , who are not dupes, who know all the while that
   they are promising impossibilities--renounce on behalf of this child
   what they find it very hard to renounce for themselves--"all covetous
   desires of the world and the carnal desires of the flesh, so that they
   will not follow nor be led by them." How can they harden their faces to
   utter such a false promise, such a mockery of renunciation before the
   presence of the Father Almighty? Might not angels weep as they hear the
   awful promise uttered? Then in the presence of high heaven they profess
   on behalf of this child that he steadfastly believes the creed, when
   they know, or might pretty shrewdly judge that the little creature is
   not yet a steadfast believer in anything, much less in Christ's going
   down into hell. Mark, they do not say merely that the babe shall
   believe the creed, but they affirm that he does, for they answer in the
   child's name, "All this I steadfastly believe. Not we steadfastly
   believe," but I, the little baby there, unconscious of all their
   professions and confessions of faith. In answer to the question, "Wilt
   thou be baptized in this faith?" they reply for the infant, "That is my
   desire." Surely the infant has no desire in the matter, or at the
   least, no one has been authorized to declare any desires on his behalf.
   But this is not all, for then these godly, intelligent people next
   promise on the behalf of the infant, that "he shall obediently keep all
   God's holy will and commandments, and walk in the same all the days of
   his life." Now, I ask you, dear friends, you who know what true
   religion means, can you walk in all God's holy commandments yourselves?
   Dare you make this day a vow on your own part, that you would renounce
   the devil and all his works, the pomps and vanities of this wicked
   world, and all the sinful lusts of the flesh? Dare you, before God,
   make such a promise as that? You desire such holiness, you earnestly
   strive after it, but you look for it from God's promise, not from your
   own. If you dare make such vows I doubt your knowledge of your own
   hearts and of the spirituality of Gods's law. But even if you could do
   this for yourself, would you venture to make such a promise for any
   other person? For the best-born infant on earth? Come, brethren, what
   say you? Is not your reply ready and plain? There is not room for two
   opinions among men determined to observe truth in all their ways and
   words . I can understand a simple, ignorant rustic, who has never
   learned to read, doing all this at the command of a priest and under
   the eye of a squire. I can even understand persons doing this when the
   Reformation was in its dawn, and men had newly crept out of the
   darkness of Popery; but I cannot understand gracious, godly people,
   standing at the font to insult the all-gracious Father with vows and
   promises framed upon a fiction, and involving practical falsehood. How
   dare intelligent believer s in Christ to utter words which they know in
   their conscience to be wickedly aside from truth? When I shall be able
   to understand the process by which gracious men so accommodate their
   consciences, even then I shall have a confirmed belief that the God of
   truth never did and never will confirm a spiritual blessing of the
   highest order in connection with the utterance of such false promises
   and untruthful vows. My brethren, does it not strike you that
   declarations so fictitious are not likely to be connected with a new
   birth wrought by the Spirit of truth?

   I have not done with this point, I must take another case, and suppose
   the sponsors and others to be ungodly, and that is no hard supposition,
   for in many cases we know that godfathers and parents have no more
   thought of religion than that idolatrous hollowed stone around which
   they gather. When these sinners have taken their places, what are they
   about to say? Why, they are about to make the solemn vows I have
   already recounted in your hearing! Totally irreligious they are, but
   yet they promise for the baby what they never did, and never thought of
   doing for themselves--they promise on behalf of this child, "that he
   will renounce the devil and all his works, and constantly believe God's
   holy Word, and obediently keep his commandments." My brethren, do not
   think I speak severely here. Really I think there is something here to
   make mockery for devils. Let every honest man lament, that ever God's
   Church should tolerate such a thing as this, and that there should be
   found gracious people who will feel grieved because I, in all kindness
   of heart, rebuke the atrocity. Unregenerate sinners promising for a
   poor babe that he shall keep all God's holy commandments which they
   themselves wantonly break every day! How can anything but the
   longsuffering of God endure this? What! not speak against it? The very
   stones in the street might cry out against the infamy of wicked men and
   women promising t hat another should renounce the devil and all his
   works, while they themselves serve the devil and do his works with
   greediness! As a climax to all this, I am asked to believe that God
   accepts that wicked promise, and as the result of it, regenerates that
   child. You cannot believe in regeneration by this operation, whether
   saints or sinners are the performers. Take them to be godly, then they
   are wrong for doing what their conscience must condemn; view them as
   ungodly, and they are wrong for promising what they know they cannot
   perform; and in neither case can God accept such worship, much less
   infallibly append regeneration to such a baptism as this.

   But you will say "Why do you cry out against it?" I cry out against it
   because I believe that baptism does not save the soul, and that the
   preaching of it has a wrong and evil influence upon men. We meet with
   persons who, when we tell them that they must be born again, assure us
   that they were born again when they were baptized. The number of these
   persons is increasing, fearfully increasing, until all grades of
   society are misled by this belief. How can any man stand up in his
   pulpit and say Ye must be born again to his congregation, when he ha s
   already assured them, by his own "unfeigned assent and consent" to it,
   that they are themselves, every one of them, born again in baptism.
   What is he to do with them? Why, my dear friends, the gospel then has
   no voice; they have rammed this ceremony down its throat and it cannot
   speak to rebuke sin. The man who has been baptized or sprinkled says,
   "I am saved, I am a member of Christ, a child of God, and an inheritor
   of the kingdom of heaven. Who are you, that you should rebuke me? Call
   me to repentance? Call me to a new life? What better life can I have?
   for I am a member of Christ--a part of Christ's body. What! rebuke me?
   I am a child of God. Cannot you see it in my face? No matter what my
   walk and conversation is, I am a child of God. Moreover, I am an
   inheritor of the kingdom of heaven. It is true, I drink and swear, and
   all that, but you know I am an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven, for
   when I die , though I live in constant sin, you will put me in the
   grave, and tell everybody that I died in sure and certain hope of the
   resurrection to eternal life.'"

   Now, what can be the influence of such preaching as this upon our
   beloved England? Upon my dear and blessed country? What but the worst
   of ills? If I loved her not, but loved myself most, I might be silent
   here, but, loving England, I cannot and dare not; and having soon to
   render an account before my God, whose servant I hope I am, I must free
   myself from this evil as well as from every other, or else on my head
   may be the doom of souls.

   Here let me bring in another point. It is a most fearful fact, that in
   no age since the Reformation has Popery made such fearful strides in
   England as during the last few years. I had comfortably believed that
   Popery was only feeding itself upon foreign subscriptions, upon a few
   titled perverts, and imported monks and nuns. I dreamed that its
   progress was not real. In fact, I have often smiled at the alarm of
   many of my brethren at the progress of Popery. But, my dear friends, we
   have been mistaken, grievously mistaken. If you will read a valuable
   paper in the magazine called "Christian Work," those of you who are not
   acquainted with it will be perfectly startled at its revelations. This
   great city is now covered with a network of monks, and priests, and
   sisters of mercy, and the conversions made are not by ones or twos, but
   by scores, till England is being regarded as the most hopeful spot for
   Romish missionary enterprise in the whole world; and at the present
   moment there is not a mission which is succeeding to anything like the
   extent which the English mission is. I covet not their money, I despise
   their sophistries, but I marvel at the way in which they gain their
   funds for the erection of their ecclesiastical buildings. It really is
   an alarming matter to see so many of our countrymen going off to that
   superstition which as a nation we once rejected, and which it was
   supposed we should never again receive. Popery is making advances such
   as you would never believe, though a spectator should tell it to you.
   Close to your very doors, perhaps even in your own houses, you may have
   evidence ere long of what a march Romanism is making. And to what is it
   to be ascribed? I say, with every ground of probability, that there is
   no marvel that Popery should increase when you have two things to make
   it grow: first of all, the falsehood o f those who profess a faith
   which they do not believe, which is quite contrary to the honesty of
   the Romanist, who does through evil report and good report hold his
   faith; and then you have, secondly, this form of error known as
   baptismal regeneration, and commonly called Puseyism, which is not only
   Puseyism, but Church-of-Englandism, because it is in the Prayer Book,
   as plainly as words can express it--you have this baptismal
   regeneration preparing stepping-stones to make it easy for men to go to
   Rome. I have but to open my eyes a little to foresee Romanism rampant
   everywhere in the future, since its germs are spreading everywhere in
   the present. In one of our courts of legislature but last Tuesday, the
   Lord Chief Justice showed his superstition, by speaking of "the risk of
   the calamity of children dying unbaptized!" Among Dissenters you see a
   veneration for structures, a modified belief in the sacredness of
   places, which is idolatry; for to believe in the sacredness of anything
   but of God and of his own Word, is to idolize, whether it is to believe
   in the sacredness of the men, the priests, or in the sacredness of the
   bricks and mortar, or of the fine linen, or what not, which you may use
   in the worship of God. I see this coming up everywhere--a belief in
   ceremony, a resting in ceremony, a veneration for altars, fonts, and
   Churches--a veneration so profound that we must not venture upon a
   remark, or straightway of sinners we are chief. Here is the essence and
   soul of Popery, peeping up under the garb of a decent respect for
   sacred things. It is impossible but that the Church of Rome must
   spread, when we who are the watch-dogs of the fold are silent, and
   others are gently and smoothly turfing the road, and making it as soft
   and smooth as possible, that converts may travel down to the nethermost
   hell of Popery. We want John Knox back again. Do not talk to me of mild
   and gentle men, of soft manners and squeamish words, we want the fiery
   Knox, and even though his vehemence should "ding our pulpits into
   blads," it were well if he did but rouse our hearts to action. We want
   Luther to tell men the truth unmistakably, in homely phrase. The velvet
   has got into our ministers' mouths o f late, but we must unrobe
   ourselves of soft raiment, and truth must be spoken, and nothing but
   truth; for of all lies which have dragged millions down to hell, I look
   upon this as being one of the most atrocious--that in a Protestant
   Church there should be found those who swear that baptism saves the
   soul. Call a man a Baptist, or a Presbyterian, or a Dissenter, or a
   Churchman, that is nothing to me--if he says that baptism saves the
   soul, out upon him, out upon him, he states what God n ever taught,
   what the Bible never laid down, and what ought never to be maintained
   by men who profess that the Bible, and the whole Bible, is the religion
   of Protestants.

   I have spoken thus much, and there will be some who will say--spoken
   thus much bitterly. Very well, be it so. Physic is often bitter, but it
   shall work well, and the physician is not bitter because his medicine
   is so; or if he be accounted so, it will matter, so long as the patient
   is cured; at all events, it is no business of the patient whether the
   physician is bitter or not, his business is with his own soul's health.
   There is the truth, and I have told it to you; and if there should be
   one among you, or if there should be one among the readers of this
   sermon when it is printed, who is resting on baptism, or resting upon
   ceremonies of any sort, I do beseech you, shake off this venomous faith
   into the fire as Paul did the viper which fastened on his hand. I pray
   you do not rest on baptism.

   "No outward forms can make you clean,

   The leprosy lies deep within."

   I do beseech you to remember that you must have a new heart and a right
   spirit, and baptism cannot give you these. You must turn from your sins
   and follow after Christ; you must have such a faith as shall make your
   life holy and your speech devout, or else you have not the faith of
   God's elect, and into God's kingdom you shall never come. I pray you
   never rest upon this wretched and rotten foundation, this deceitful
   invention of antichrist. O, may God save you from it, and bring you to
   seek the true rock of refuge for weary souls.

   I come with much brevity, and I hope with much earnestness, in the
   second place, to say that FAITH IS THE INDISPENSABLE REQUISITE TO
   SALVATION. "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; he that
   believeth not shall be damned." Faith is the one indispensable
   requisite for salvation. This faith is the gift of God. It is the work
   of the Holy Spirit. Some men believe not on Jesus; they believe not
   because they are not of Christ's sheep, as he himself said unto them;
   but his sheep hear his voice: he knows them and they follow him: he
   gives to them eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall
   any pluck them out of his hand. What is this believing? Believing
   consists in two things; first there is an accrediting of the testimony
   of God concerning his Son. God tells you that his Son came into the
   world and was made flesh, that he lived upon earth for men's sake, that
   after having spent his life in holiness he was offered up a
   propitiation for sin, that upon the cross he there and then made
   expiation--so made expiation for the sins of the world that Whosoever
   believeth in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life. If you
   would be saved, you must accredit this testimony which God gives
   concerning his own Son. Having received this testimony, the next thing
   is to confide in it--indeed here lies, I think, the essence of saving
   faith, to rest yourself for eternal salvation upon the atonement and
   the righteousness of Jesus Christ, to have done once for all with all
   reliance upon feelings or upon doings, and to trust in Jesus Christ and
   in what he did for your salvation.

   This is faith, receiving of the truth of Christ: first knowing it to be
   true, and then acting upon that belief. Such a faith as this--such real
   faith as this makes the man henceforth hate sin. How can he love the
   thing which made t he Saviour bleed? It makes him live in holiness. How
   can he but seek to honour that God who has loved him so much as to give
   his Son to die for him. This faith is spiritual in its nature and
   effects; it operates upon the entire man; it changes his heart,
   enlightens his judgment, and subdues his will; it subjects him to God's
   supremacy, and makes him receive God's Word as a little child, willing
   to receive the truth upon the ipse dixit of the divine One; it
   sanctifies his intellect, and makes him willing to be taught God's
   Word; it cleanses within; it makes clean the inside of the cup and
   platter, and it beautifies without; it makes clean the exterior conduct
   and the inner motive, so that the man, if his faith be true and real,
   becomes henceforth another man to what he ever was before.

   Now that such a faith as this should save the soul, is, I believe,
   reasonable; yea, more, it is certain, for we have seen men saved by it
   in this very house of prayer. We have seen the harlot lifted out of the
   Stygian ditch of her sin, and made an honest woman; we have seen the
   thief reclaimed; we have known the drunkard in hundreds of instances to
   be sobered; we have observed faith to work such a change, that all the
   neighbours who have seen it have gazed and admired, even though they
   hated it; we have seen faith deliver men in the hour of temptation, and
   help them to consecrate themselves and their substance to God; we have
   seen, and hope still to see yet more widely, deeds of heroic
   consecration to God and displays of witness-bearing against the common
   current of the times, which have proved to us that faith does affect
   the man, does save the soul. My hearers, if you would be saved, you
   must believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. Let me urge you with all my
   heart to look nowhere but to Christ crucified for your salvation. Oh!
   if you rest upon any ceremony, though it be not baptism--if you rest
   upon any other than Jesus Christ, you must perish, as surely as this
   Book is true. I pray you believe not every spirit, but though I, or an
   angel from heaven, preach any other doctrine than this, let him be
   accursed, for this, and this alone, is the soul-saving truth which
   shall regenerate the world--"He that believeth and is baptized shall be
   saved." Away from all the tag-rags, wax candles, and millinery of
   Puseyism! away from all the gorgeous pomp of Popery! away from the
   fonts of Church-of-Englandism! we bid you turn your eyes to that naked
   cross, where hangs as a bleeding man the Son of God.

   "None but Jesus, none but Jesus

   Can do helpless sinners good."

   There is life in a look at the crucified; there is life at this moment
   for you. Whoever among you can believe in the great love of God towards
   man in Christ Jesus, you shall be saved. If you can believe that our
   great Father desireth us to come to him--that he panteth for us--that
   he calleth us every day with the loud voice of his Son's wounds; if you
   can believe now that in Christ there is pardon for transgressions past,
   and cleansing for years to come; if you can trust him to save you, you
   have already the marks of regeneration. The work of salvation is
   commenced in you, so far as the Spirit's work is concerned: it is
   finished in you so far as Christ's work is concerned. O, I would plead
   with you--lay hold on Jesus Christ. This is the foundation: build on
   it. This is the rock of refuge: fly to it. I pray you fly to it now.
   Life is short: time speeds with eagle's-wing. Swift as the dove pursued
   by the hawk, fly, fly poor sinner, to God's dear Son; now touch the hem
   of his garment; now look into that dear face, once marred with sorrows
   for you; look into those eyes, once shedding tears for you. Trust him,
   and if you find him false, then you must perish; but false you never
   will find him while this word standeth true, "He that believeth and is
   baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned."
   God give us this vital, essential faith, without which there is no
   salvation. Baptized, re-baptized, circumcised, confirmed, fed upon
   sacraments, and buried in consecrated ground--ye shall all perish
   except ye believe in him. The word is express and plain--he that
   believeth not may plead his baptism, may plead anything he likes, "But
   he that believeth not shall be damned;" for him there is nothing but
   the wrath of God, the flames of hell, eternal perdition. So Christ
   declares, and so must it be.

   But now to close, there are some who say, "Ah! but baptism is in the
   text; where do you put that?" That shall be another point, and then we
   shall have done.

   THE BAPTISM IN THE TEXT IS ONE EVIDENTLY CONNECTED WITH FAITH. "He that
   believeth and is baptized shall be saved." It strikes me, there is no
   supposition here, that anybody would be baptized who did not believe;
   or, if there be such a supposition, it is very clearly laid down that
   his baptism will be of no use to him, for he will be damned, baptized
   or not, unless he believes. The baptism of the text seems to me--my
   brethren, if you differ from me I am sorry for it, but I must hold my
   opinion and out with it--it seems to me that baptism is connected with,
   nay, directly follows belief. I would not insist too much upon the
   order of the words, but for other reasons, I think that baptism should
   follow believing. At any rate it effectually avoids the error we have
   been combating. A man who knows that he is saved by believing in Christ
   does not, when he is baptized, lift his baptism into a saving
   ordinance. In fact, he is the very best protester against that mistake,
   because he holds that he has no right to be baptized until he is saved.
   He b ears a testimony against baptismal regeneration in his being
   baptized as professedly an already regenerate person. Brethren, the
   baptism here meant is a baptism connected with faith, and to this
   baptism I will admit there is very much ascribed in Scripture. Into
   that question I am not going; but I do find some very remarkable
   passages in which baptism is spoken of very strongly. I find
   this--"Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the
   name of the Lord." I find as much as this elsewhere; I know that
   believer's baptism itself does not wash away sin, yet it is so the
   outward sign and emblem of it to the believer, that the thing visible
   may be described as the thing signified. Just as our Saviour
   said--"This is my body," when it was not his body, but bread; yet,
   inasmuch as it represented his body, it was fair and right according to
   the usage of language to say, "Take, eat, this is my body." And so,
   inasmuch as baptism to the believer representeth the washing of sin--it
   may be called the washing of sin--not that it is so, but that it is to
   saved souls the outward symbol and representation of what is done by
   the power of the Holy Spirit, in the man who believes in Christ.

   What connection has this baptism with faith? I think it has just this,
   baptism is the avowal of faith; the man was Christ's soldier, but now
   in baptism he puts on his regimentals. The man believed in Christ, but
   his faith remained between God an d his own soul. In baptism he says to
   the baptizer, "I believe in Jesus Christ;" he says to the Church, "I
   unite with you as a believer in the common truths of Christianity;" he
   saith to the onlooker, "Whatever you may do, as for me, I will serve
   the Lord." It is the avowal of his faith.

   Next, we think baptism is also to the believer a testimony of his
   faith; he does in baptism tell the world what he believes. "I am
   about," saith he, "to be buried in water. I believe that the Son of God
   was metaphorically baptized in suffering: I believe he was literally
   dead and buried." To rise again out of the water sets forth to all men
   that he believes in the resurrection of Christ. There is a showing
   forth in the Lord's Supper of Christ's death, and there is a showing
   forth in baptism of Christ's burial and resurrection. It is a type, a
   sign, a symbol, a mirror to the world: a looking-glass in which
   religion is as it were reflected. We say to the onlooker, when he asks
   what is the meaning of this ordinance, "We mean to set forth our faith
   that Christ was buried, and that he rose again from the dead, and we
   avow this death and resurrection to be the ground of our trust."

   Again, baptism is also Faith's taking her proper place. It is, or
   should be one of her first acts of obedience. Reason looks at baptism,
   and says, "Perhaps there is nothing in it; it cannot do me any good."
   "True," says Faith, "and therefore will I observe it. If it did me some
   good my selfishness would make me do it, but inasmuch as to my sense
   there is no good in it, since I am bidden by my Lord thus to fulfil all
   righteousness, it is my first public declaration that a thing which
   looks to be unreasonable and seems to be unprofitable, being commanded
   by God, is law, is law to me. If my Master had told me to pick up six
   stones and lay them in a row I would do it, without demanding of him,
   What good will it do?' Cui bono? is no fit question for soldiers of
   Jesus. The very simplicity and apparent uselessness of the ordinance
   should make the believer say, Therefore I do it because it becomes the
   better test to me of my obedience to my Master.'" When you tell your
   servant to do something, and he cannot comprehend it, if he turns round
   and says, "Please, sir, what for?" you are quite clear that he hardly
   understands the relation between master and servant. So when God tells
   me to do a thing, if I say, "What for?" I cannot have taken the place
   which Faith ought to occupy, which is that of simple obedience to
   whatever the Lord hath said. Baptism is commanded, and Faith obeys
   because it is commanded, and thus takes her proper place.

   Once more, baptism is a refreshment to Faith. While we are made up of
   body and soul as we are, we shall need some means by which the body
   shall sometimes be stirred up to co-work with the soul. In the Lord's
   Supper my faith is assisted by the outward and visible sign. In the
   bread and in the wine I see no superstitious mystery, I see nothing but
   bread and wine, but in that bread and wine I do see to my faith an
   assistant. Through the sign my faith sees the thing signified. So in
   baptism there is no mysterious efficacy in the baptistry or in the
   water. We attach no reverence to the one or to the other, but we do see
   in the water and in the baptism such an assistance as brings home to
   our faith most manifestly our being buried with Christ, and our rising
   again in newness of life with him. Explain baptism thus, dear friends,
   and there is no fear of Popery rising out of it. Explain it thus, and
   we cannot suppose any soul will be led to trust to it; but it takes it
   s proper place among the ordinances of God's house. To lift it up in
   the other way, and say men are saved by it--ah! my friends, how much of
   mischief that one falsehood has done and may do, eternity alone will
   disclose. Would to God another George Fox would spring up in all his
   quaint simplicity and rude honesty to rebuke the idol-worship of this
   age; to rail at their holy bricks and mortar, holy lecterns, holy
   alters, holy surplices, right reverend fathers, and I know not what.
   These things are not holy. God is holy; his truth is holy; holiness
   belongs not to the carnal and the material, but to the spiritual. O
   that a trumpet-tongue would cry out against the superstition of the
   age. I cannot, as George Fox did, give up baptism and the Lord's
   Supper, but I would infinitely sooner do it, counting it the smaller
   mistake of the two than perpetrate and assist in perpetrating the
   uplifting of baptism and the Lord's Supper out of their proper place. O
   my beloved friends, the comrades of my struggles and witnessings, cling
   to the salvation of faith, and abhor the salvation of priests. If I am
   not mistaken, the day will come when we shall have to fight for a
   simple spiritual religion far more than we do now. We have been
   cultivating friendship with those who are either unscriptural in creed
   or else dishonest, who either believe baptismal regeneration, or
   profess that they do, and swear before God that they do when they do
   not. The time is come when there shall be no more truce or parley
   between God's servants and the time-servers. The time is come when
   those who follow God must follow God, and those who try to trim and
   dress themselves and find out a way which is pleasing to the flesh and
   gentle to carnal desires, must go their way. A great winnowing time is
   coming to God's saints, and we shall be clearer one of these days than
   we now are from union with those who are upholding Popery, under the
   pretence of teaching Protestantism. We shall be clear, I say, of those
   who teach salvation by baptism, instead of salvation by the blood of
   our blessed Master, Jesus Christ. O may the Lord gird up your loins.
   Believe me, it is no trifle. It may be that on this ground Armageddon
   shall be fought. Here shall come the great battle between Christ and
   his saints on the one hand, and the world, and forms, and ceremonies,
   on the other. If we are overcome here, there may be years of blood and
   persecution, and tossing to and fro between darkness and light; but if
   we are brave and bold, and flinch not here, but stand to God's truth,
   the future of England may be bright and glorious. O for a truly
   reformed Church in England, and a godly race to maintain it! The
   world's future depends on it under God, for in proportion as truth is
   marred at home, truth is maimed abroad. Out of any system which teaches
   salvation by baptism must spring infidelity, an infidelity which the
   false Church already seems willing to nourish and foster beneath her
   wing. God save this favoured land from the brood of her own established
   religion. Brethren, stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ has made
   you free, and be not afraid of any sudden fear nor calamity when it
   cometh, for he who trusteth to the Lord, mercy shall compass him about,
   and he who is faithful to God and Christ shall hear it said at the
   last, "Well done, good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of
   the Lord." May the Lord bless this word for Christ's sake.

   [Note.--Having been informed that the whole of the burial service is
   not usually read at executions, I have, for the sake of fairness,
   altered the passage upon page 318, although it strikes me that I might
   justly have retained it, since the rubric of the Church and not the
   practice of some of its ministers is that with which we must deal. The
   rubric says, "The office ensuing is not to be used for any that die
   unbaptized, or excommunicate, or have laid violent hands upon
   themselves." The victim of our capital punishment is not by this rubric
   shut out from the privileges (?) of the Anglican burial service, unless
   his condemnation may be viewed as tantamount to excommunication, which
   I can hardly think be the case, since many condemned persons receive
   the sacrament. I have also altered an incorrect expression on page 316,
   which has been pointed out to me by both friends and foes. May God
   grant that the controversy which this sermon has commenced may lead to
   the advancement of his truth, and the enlightenment of many.]

                 The Superlative Excellence Of The Holy Spirit

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JUNE 12, 1864, BY THE REV. C. H. SPURGEON,
   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Nevertheless I tell you the truth. It is expedient for you that I go
   away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but
   if I depart, I will send Him unto you." John 16:7.

   THE saints of God may very justly reckon their losses among their
   greatest gains. The adversities of Believers minister much to their
   prosperity. Although we know this, through the infirmity of the flesh
   we tremble at soul-enriching afflictions and dread to see those black
   ships which bring us such freights of golden treasure. When the Holy
   Spirit sanctifies the furnace, the flame refines our gold and consumes
   our dross, yet the dull ore of our nature likes not the glowing coals
   and had rather lie quiet in the dark mines of earth. As silly children
   cry because they are called to drink the medicine which will heal their
   sicknesses, even so do we.

   Our gracious Savior, however, loves us too wisely to spare us the
   trouble because of our childish fears. He foresees the advantage which
   will spring from our griefs and therefore thrusts us into them out of
   wisdom and true affection. It was a very great trouble to these first
   Apostles to lose their Teacher and Friend. Sorrow had filled their
   hearts at the thought that He should depart, but yet His departure was
   to give them the greater blessing of the Holy Spirit. And therefore
   their entreaties and tears cannot avert the dreaded separation. Christ
   will not gratify their wishes at so vast an expense as the withholding
   of the Spirit. Mourn as they may under the severe trial, Jesus will not
   remain with them because His departure is in the highest degree
   expedient.

   Beloved, let us expect to be subject to the same loving discipline. Let
   us reckon upon losing happy frames and choice enjoyments when Jesus
   knows that the loss will be better for us than the enjoyment. God has
   given two great gifts to His people--the first is His Son for us. The
   second is His Spirit to us. After He had given His Son for us, to
   become Incarnate, to work righteousness, and to offer an
   Atonement--after that gift had been fully bestowed there remained no
   more to be conferred in that respect. "It is finished!" proclaimed the
   completion of Atonement and His Resurrection showed the perfection of
   Justification. It was not, therefore, necessary that Christ should
   remain any longer upon earth since His work below is forever finished.

   Now is the season for the second gift, the descent of the Holy Spirit.
   This could not be bestowed until Christ had ascended, because this
   choice favor was reserved to grace, with highest honor, the triumphant
   ascension of the great Redeemer. "When He ascended up on high, He led
   captivity captive and gave gifts unto men." This was, as Peter tells
   us, the great promise which Jesus received of His Father. "Therefore
   being by the right hand of God exalted and having received of the
   Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He has shed forth this, which
   you now see and hear." That His triumphal entrance into Heaven might be
   stamped with signal Glory, the gifts of the Spirit of God could not be
   scattered among the sons of men until the Lord had gone up with a
   shout, even the Lord with the sound of trumpet.

   The first gift being completed, it became necessary that He, whose
   Person and work make up that priceless gift, should withdraw Himself
   that He might have power to distribute the second benefit by which
   alone the first gift becomes of any service to us. Christ Crucified is
   of no practical value to us without the work of the Holy Spirit. And
   the Atonement which Jesus worked can never save a single soul unless
   the blessed Spirit of God shall apply it to the heart and conscience.
   Jesus is never seen until the Holy Spirit opens the eyes--the water
   from the Well of Life is never received until the Holy Spirit has drawn
   it from the depths.

   As medicine unused for want of the physician's word. As sweets untasted
   because out of reach. As treasure unvalued because hidden in the
   earth--such is Jesus the Savior--until the Holy Spirit teaches us to
   know Him and applies His blood to our souls. It is to the honor of the
   Holy Spirit that I desire to speak this morning and O, may the same
   hallowed flame which of old sat upon the Apostles now rest upon the
   preacher and may the Word come with power to our hearts!

   I. We shall commence our discourse by the remark that THE BODILY
   PRESENCE OF CHRIST MUST HAVE BEEN EXCEEDINGLY PRECIOUS. How precious
   those alone can tell who much love Christ. Love always desires to be in
   the company of the thing beloved and absence causes grief. What is
   fully meant by the expression, "Sorrow has filled your heart," those
   only can know who anticipate a like painful bereavement. Jesus had
   become the Joy of their eyes, the Sun of their days, the Star of their
   nights--like the spouse, as she came up from the wilderness--they
   leaned upon their Beloved. They were as little children and now that
   their Lord and Master was going, they felt they should be left orphans.

   Well might they have great sorrow of heart! So much love, so much
   sorrow, when the object of love is withdrawn. Judge, my Brethren, the
   joy which the bodily Presence of Christ would give to us this morning,
   and then you can tell how precious it must be. Have we not, some of us,
   been looking for years for the personal advent of Christ? We have
   lifted up our eyes in the morning and we have said, "Perhaps He will
   come this day." And when the day has closed we have continued our
   watching in our sleepless hours and renewed our hopes with the rising
   of the sun. We longingly expect Him according to His promise. And like
   men who watch for their Lord, we stand with loins girt about waiting
   for His appearing.

   We are looking for and hastening unto the Day of the Lord. This is the
   bright hope which cheers the Christian, the hope that the Savior shall
   descend to reign among His people gloriously. Suppose Him to appear
   suddenly on this platform now--how would you clap your hands! Why, the
   lame among you would, at the joy of His appearance, leap like a hart
   and even the dumb might sing for joy! The Presence of the Master! What
   rapture! Come quickly! Come quickly, Lord Jesus!

   It must be, indeed, a precious thing to enjoy the corporeal Presence of
   Christ. Think of the advantage it would be in the instruction of His
   people. No mystery need puzzle us if we could refer all to Him. The
   disputes of the Christian Church would soon be ended for He would tell
   us what His Word meant beyond dispute. There would be no discouragement
   to the Church in her work of faith and labor of love, for the Presence
   of Christ would be the end of all difficulties and insure conquest over
   all enemies. We should not have to mourn as we now do over our
   forgetfulness of Jesus, for we should sometimes catch a look at Him.
   And a sight of Him would give us a store ofjoy so that like the Prophet
   of Horeb we could go forty days in the strength of that meat!

   It were a delightful thing to know that Christ was somewhere upon
   earth, for then He would take the personal supervision of His universal
   Church. He could warn us of apostates. He could reject the hypocrites.
   He would comfort the feeble-minded and rebuke the erring. How
   delightful would it be to see Him walking among the golden
   candlesticks, holding the stars in His right hand! Churches need not,
   then, be subdivided and rent with evil passions. Christ would create
   unity. Schism would cease to be and heresy would be rooted out. The
   Presence of Jesus, whose countenance is as the sun shining in his
   strength, would ripen all the fruits of our garden, consume all the
   weeds, and quicken every plant!

   The two-edged sword of His mouth would slay His foes and His eyes of
   fire would kindle the holy passions of His friends. But I shall not
   enlarge upon that point because it is one in which fancy exercises
   itself at the expense ofjudgment. I question whether the pleasure,
   which the thought of Christ's being here in the flesh has given us just
   now, may not have had a leaven of carnality in it. I question whether
   the Church is yet prepared to enjoy the corporeal Presence of her
   Savior without falling into the error of knowing Him after the flesh.
   It may be it shall need centuries of education before the Church is fit
   to see her Savior in the flesh on earth again, because I see in my own
   self--and I suppose it is so in you-- that much of the delight which I
   expect from the company of Christ is according to the sight of the eyes
   and the judgment of the mind. And sight is ever the mark and symbol of
   the flesh.

   II. However, leaving that point, we come to the second, which is THAT
   THE PRESENCE OF THE COMFORTER,

   AS WE HAVE IT UPON EARTH, IS VERY MUCH BETTER THAN THE BODILY PRESENCE
   OF CHRIST. We have fancied that the bodily Presence of Christ would
   make us blessed and confer innumerable benefits. But according to our
   text the Presence of the Holy Spirit working in the Church is more
   expedient for the Church. I think this will be clear to you, if you
   think for a moment, that the bodily Presence of Christ on earth,
   however good it might be for the Church, would in our present condition
   involve many inconveniences which are avoided by His Presence through
   the Holy Spirit.

   Christ, being most truly Man, must as to His Manhood inhabit a certain
   place and in order to get to Christ, it would be necessary for us to
   travel to His place of residence. Conceive all men compelled to travel
   from the ends of the earth to visit the Lord Jesus Christ, dwelling
   upon Mount Zion, or in the city of Jerusalem. What a lengthened voyage
   would that be for those who live in the far-off ends of the world!

   Doubtless they would joyfully undertake it and as pence would be
   universal and poverty be banished, men might not be restrained from
   taking such a journey, but might all be able to accomplish it? As they
   could not all live where they could every morning see Christ, they must
   be content with every now and then getting a glimpse of Him. But see,
   my Brethren, the Holy Spirit, the vicar of Christ, dwells everywhere!
   And if we wish to apply to the Holy Spirit, we have no need to move an
   inch. In the closet we can find Him, or in the streets we can talk with
   Him. Jesus Christ could not be present in this congregation after the
   flesh and yet present in a neighboring Church, much less present in
   America and in Australia and in Europe and in Africa, at the same time.

   But the Holy Spirit is everywhere! And through that Holy Spirit Christ
   keeps His promise, "Where two or three are met together in My name,
   there am I in the midst of them." He could not keep that promise
   according to the flesh--at least we are quite unable to conceive of His
   so doing. But through the Holy Spirit we sweetly enjoy His Presence and
   hope to do so to the world's end. Think again--access to Christ--if He
   were here in His corporeal Personality, would not be very easy to all
   Believers. There are only twenty-four hours in the day and if our Lord
   never slept, if, as a Man, He could still live and, like the saints
   above, rest not day nor night, yet there are only the twenty-four
   hours. And what were twenty-four hours for the supervision of a Church
   which we trust will cover the whole earth?

   How could a thousand millions of Believers all receive immediate
   personal comfort either from His lips or the smiles of His face? Even
   at the present moment there are some millions of true saints upon
   earth--what could one man do by his personal presence--even though that
   one man were Incarnate Deity? What could He do in one day for the
   comfort of all of these? Why, we could not possibly expect each one of
   us to see Him every day--no, we could scarcely expect to have our turn
   once in the year!

   But, Beloved, we can now see Jesus every hour and every moment of every
   hour! So often as you bow the knee, His Spirit, who represents Him, can
   commune with you and bless you. No matter whether it is in the dead of
   night that your cry goes up, or under the blaze of burning noon--there
   is the Spirit waiting to be gracious and your sighs and cries climb up
   to Christ in Heaven and return with answers of peace. These
   difficulties did not occur to you, perhaps, in your first thoughts. But
   if you meditate awhile you will see that the Presence of the Spirit,
   avoiding that difficulty, makes Christ accessible to every saint at all
   times. Not to a few choice favorites, but to every believing man and
   woman the Holy Spirit is accessible and thus the whole body of the
   faithful can enjoy present and perpetual communion with Christ.

   We ought to consider yet once more that Christ's Presence in the flesh
   upon earth, for any other purpose than that of ending the present
   dispensation, would involve another difficulty. Of course every Word
   which Christ had spoken from the time of the Apostles until now would
   have been Inspired. Being Inspired it would have been a thousand pities
   that it should fall to the ground. Busy scribes would therefore be
   always taking down Christ's Words. And, my Brethren, if in the short
   course of three years our Savior managed to do and to say so much that
   one of the Evangelists informs us that if all had been written the
   world itself could not have contained the books which would have been
   written--I ask you to imagine what a mass of literature the Christian
   Church would have acquired if she had preserved the Words of Christ
   throughout these one thousand eight hundred and sixty-four years!

   Certainly we should not have had the Word of God in the simple compact
   form of a pocket Bible--it would have consisted of innumerable volumes
   of the sayings and deeds of the Lord Jesus Christ! Only the studious,
   no, not even the studious could have read all the Lord's teachings! And
   the poor and the illiterate must ever have been at a great
   disadvantage. But now we have a Book which is finished within a narrow
   compass with not another line to be added to it. The canon of
   Revelation is sealed up forever and the poorest man in England,
   believing in Christ, going with a humble soul to that Book and looking
   up to Jesus Christ who is present through His Spirit, though not after
   the flesh, may, in a short time comprehend the Doctrines of Grace and
   understand with all saints what are the heights and depths and know the
   love of Christ which passes knowledge.

   So then, on the score of inconvenience, precious as the corporeal
   Presence of Christ might be, it is infinitely better for the Church's
   good that, until the day of her Millennial Glory, Christ should be
   present by His Spirit and not in the flesh. Yet more, my Brethren! If
   Jesus Christ were still present with His Church in the flesh, the life
   of faith would not have such room for its display as it now has. The
   more there is visible to the eyes, the less room for faith--the least
   faith, the most show. The Romish Church, which has little enough of
   true faith, provides everything to work upon the senses-- your nostrils
   are regaled with incense and your ears are delighted with sweet sounds.
   The more faith grows, the less it needs outward helps. And when faith
   shows her true character and is clean divorced from sense and sight,
   then she wants absolutely nothing to rest upon but the invisible power
   of God!

   She then has learned to hang as the world hangs--upon no seen support!
   Just as the eternal arch of yon blue sky springs right up without
   props, so faith rests upon the invisible pillars of God's Truth and
   faithfulness, needing nothing to shore or buttress her. The Presence of
   Christ Jesus here in bodily flesh and the knowing of Him according to
   the flesh, would be the bringing back of the saints to a life of sight
   and in a measure spoil the simplicity of naked trust. You remember the
   Apostle Paul says, "We now know no man after the flesh. Yes," says he,
   "though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now after the flesh
   know we Him no more." To the skeptic, who should ask us, "Why do you
   believe in Christ?" if Jesus had remained upon the earth, we could
   always give an easy answer--"There He is--there is the Man. Behold Him
   as He continues still to work miracles."

   There would be very little room for faith's holy adherence to the bare
   Word of God and no opportunity for her to glorify God, trusting where
   she cannot trace. But now, Beloved, the fact that we have nothing
   visible to point to which carnal minds can understand--this very fact
   makes the path of faith more truly congenial with its noble character--

   "Faith, mighty faith, the promise sees, And looks to that alone," which
   she could hardly do, if she could look upon the visible Person of a
   present Savior. Happy day will it be for us when faith enjoys the full
   fruition of her hopes in the triumphant advent of her Lord! But His
   absence, alone, can train and educate her to the needed point of
   spiritual refinement.

   Furthermore, the Presence of Jesus Christ on earth would materially
   affect the character of God's great battle against error and sin.
   Suppose that Christ were to destroy the preachers of error by miracle.
   Suppose that persecuting monarchs had their arms dried up, or that all
   men who would oppose Christ were suddenly devoured by fire. Why then it
   would be more a battle between physical greatness and moral evil, than
   a warfare in which only spiritual force is employed on the side of
   right. But now that Christ has gone, the fight is all between Spirit
   and spirit--between God the Holy Spirit and Satan--between Truth and
   error. It is between the earnestness of believing men and the
   infatuation of unbelieving men. Now the fight is fair.

   We have no miracles on our side--we do not want them--the Holy Spirit
   is enough! We call no fire from Heaven-- no earthquake shakes the
   ground beneath our foemen's feet. Korah is not swallowed up. Dathan
   does not go down alive into the pit. Physical force is left to our
   enemies--we do not ask for it. Why? Because by the Divine working we
   can vanquish error without it. In the name of the Holy One of Israel,
   in whose cause we have been enlisted--by His might we are enough--no
   need for miracles and signs and wonders. If Christ were here still
   working miracles, the battle were not so spiritual as it now is. But
   the absence of the corporeal Savior makes it a spiritual conflict of
   Spirit of the noblest and most sublime order.

   Again, dear Friends, the Holy Spirit is more valuable to the Church in
   her present militant state than the Presence of Christ could be
   conceived to be, because Christ must be here in one of two ways--either
   He must be here suffering, or not suffering. If Christ were here
   suffering, then how could we conclude that His Atonement was finished?
   Is it not much better for our faith that our blessed Lord, having once
   and for all made expiation for sin, should sit at the right hand of the
   Father? Is it not much better, I ask, than to see Him still struggling
   and suffering here below? "Oh, but," you say, "perhaps He would not
   suffer!" Then I pray you, do not wish to have Him here till our warfare
   is accomplished, for to see an unsuffering Christ in the midst of His
   suffering people--to see His face calm and clear when yours and mine
   are wrinkled with grief--to see Him smiling when we are weeping, this
   were intolerable! No, it could not be! Brethren, if He is a suffering
   Christ in our sight, then we should suspect that He had not finished
   His work.

   And, on the other hand, if He is an unsuffering Christ, then it would
   look as if He were not a faithful High Priest made like unto His
   Brethren. These two difficulties throw us back into a state of
   thankfulness to God that we have not the dilemma to answer, but that
   the Spirit of God, who is Christ present on earth, relieves us from
   these difficulties and gives us all the advantage we could expect from
   Christ's Presence in a tenfold degree. Only this one further remark,
   that the personal Presence of Christ, much as we think of it, did not
   produce very great results in His disciples until the Spirit was poured
   forth from on high.

   Christ was their Teacher--how much did they learn? Why, there is
   Philip--Christ has to say to him, "Have I been so long time with you
   and yet have you not known Me, Philip?" They were puzzled by questions
   which little children can now answer! You can see that at the end of
   their three years course of training with Christ, they had made but
   slender progress. Christ is not only their Teacher, but their
   Comforter--yet how frequently Christ failed to console them because of
   their unbelief. After He had uttered that delightful discourse which we
   have been reading, He found them sleeping for sorrow. In this very
   chapter, when He is trying to comfort them, He adds, "But because I
   have said these things unto you, sorrow has filled your heart."

   Christ's object was to foster the Graces of His disciples--but where
   were their Graces? Here is Peter--he has not even the Grace of courage
   and consistency, but denies his Master while the rest of them forsake
   Him and flee. There was not even the Spirit of Christ infused into
   them! Their zeal was not tempered with love, for they wanted fire from
   Heaven to consume His adversaries and Peter drew a sword to cut off the
   High Priest's servant's ear. They scarcely knew the Truths which their
   Master taught and they were far enough from imbibing His heavenly
   Spirit. Even their endowments were slender. It is true they once worked
   miracles and preached, but with what success?

   Do you ever hear of Peter winning three thousand sinners under a sermon
   till the Holy Spirit came? Do you find any of them able to edify others
   and build up the Church of Christ? No, the ministry of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, considered only as to its immediate fruits, was not to be
   compared with ministries after the descent of the Spirit. "He came unto
   His own and His own received Him not." His great work as a Redeemer was
   a complete triumph from beginning to end. But as a Teacher, since the
   Spirit of God was only upon Him and not upon the people, His words were
   rejected, His entreaties were despised and His warnings unheeded by the
   great multitude of the people.

   The mighty blessing came when the words of Joel were fulfilled, "And it
   shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out My Spirit upon all
   flesh. And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men
   shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions: and also upon the
   servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out My
   Spirit." That was the blessing and a blessing which, we venture to say
   again, was so rich and so rare that it was, indeed, expedient that
   Jesus Christ should go, that the Holy Spirit might descend.

   III. I now pass on to the third point of the subject with brevity. We
   have come thus far--the Presence of Christ admitted to be precious, but
   the Presence of the Holy Spirit most clearly shown to be of more
   practical value to the Church of God than the corporeal Presence of the
   Lord Jesus Christ. Advance, then, to the third point, THE PRESENCE OF

   THE COMFORTER IS SUPERLATIVELY VALUABLE. We may gather this, first,
   from the effects which were seen upon the day of Pentecost. On the day
   of Pentecost the heavenly Wind sounded the alarm of war. The soldiers
   were ill prepared for it. They were a slender band, having only this
   virtue--they were content to wait until power was given to them.

   They sat still in the upper room. That mighty sound was heard across
   Jerusalem. The forceful Whirlwind travels on until it reaches the
   chosen spot. It fills the place where they are sitting. Here was an
   omen of what the Spirit of God is to be to the Church! It is to come
   mysteriously upon the Church according to the Sovereign will of God.
   But when He comes like the Wind, it is to purge the moral atmosphere
   and to quicken the pulse of all who spiritually breathe. This is a
   blessing, indeed! A gift which the Church greatly wants--I would that
   this rushing mighty Wind would come upon this Church with an
   irresistible force which should carry everything before it--the force
   of Truth, but of more than Truth-- the force of God driving His Truth
   home upon the heart and conscience of men!

   I would that you and I could breathe this Wind and receive its
   invigorating influence that we might be made champions of God and of
   His Truth. O that it would drive away our mists of doubt and clouds of
   error! Come, Sacred Wind, England needs You--the whole earth requires
   You! The foul gases which brood in this deadly calm would fly if Your
   Divine lightning enlightened the world and set the moral atmosphere in
   commotion. Come, Holy Spirit, come. We can do nothing without You! If
   we have Your Wind, we spread our sails and speed onward towards Glory!

   Then the Spirit came as fire. A fire-shower accompanied the rushing
   mighty Wind. What a blessing is this to the Church! The Church wants
   fire to quicken her ministers, to give zeal and energy to all her
   members. Having this fire, she burns her way to success! The world
   meets her with the fire of firewood, but she confronts the world with
   the fire of kindling spirits and of souls aglow with the love of Jesus
   Christ. She trusts not to the wit and eloquence and wisdom of her
   preachers, but to the Divine Fire which clothes them with energy. She
   knows that men are irresistible when they are filled with hallowed
   enthusiasm sent from God. She trusts, therefore, in this and her cry
   is, "Come, Holy Fire, abide upon our pastors and teachers! Rest upon
   every one of us!" This Fire is a blessing Christ did not bring us in
   Person, but which He now gives through His Spirit to the Church.

   Then there came from the fire-shower a descent of tongues. This, too,
   is the privilege of the Church. When the Lord gave the Apostles
   different tongues, He did, as it were, give them the keys of the
   various kingdoms. "Go," says He, "Judea is not My only dominion. Go and
   unlock the gates of every empire. Here are the keys, you can speak
   every language." Dear Friends, though we can no longer speak with every
   man in his own tongue, yet we have the keys of the whole world swinging
   at our girdle if we have the Spirit of God with us. You have the keys
   of human hearts if the Spirit of God speaks through you. I have this
   day the keys of the hearts of the multitudes here if the Holy Spirit
   wills to use them!

   There is an efficacy about the Gospel, when the Spirit is with us,
   little dreamed of by those who call it the foolishness of men. I am
   persuaded that the results which have followed ministry in our lifetime
   are trivial and insignificant compared with what they would be if the
   Spirit of God were more mightily at work in our midst. There is no
   reason in the nature of the Gospel or the power of the Spirit why a
   whole congregation should not be converted under one sermon! There is
   no reason in God's Nature why a nation should not be born in a day and
   why, within a single twelve months, a dozen ministers preaching
   throughout the world might not be the means of converting every elect
   son and daughter of Adam to a knowledge of the Truth of God. The Spirit
   of God is perfectly Irresistible when He puts forth His full power!

   His power is so Divinely Omnipotent that the moment He goes forth the
   work is achieved, The great prophetic event, we see, occurred on the
   day of Pentecost. The success given was only the first
   fruits--Pentecost is not the harvest. We have been accustomed to look
   on Pentecost as a great and wonderful display of Divine power not at
   all to be equaled in modern times. Brethren, it is to be exceeded! I
   stand not upon Pentecost as upon a towering mountain, wondering at my
   height, but I look at Pentecost as a little rising knoll from which I
   am to look up to mountains far loftier! I look not to Pentecost as the
   shouting of our harvest home and the bringing in of the sheaves into
   the garner. No! But as an offering of the first wave sheaf before the
   altar of God!

   You must expect greater things, pray for greater things, long for
   greater things! Here is this England of ours, sunk in stolid ignorance
   of the Gospel. Weighing like a nightmare upon her bosom we have
   baptismal regeneration supported by a horde of priests who either
   believe that dogma, or hold their benefices by subscribing to a lie.
   How is this incubus to be shaken off from the living bosom of England?
   "Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, says the Lord." There is
   France cursed with infidelity, fickle, gay, given up to pleasure--how
   is she to be made sober and sanctified unto God? "Not by might, but by
   My Spirit, says the Lord." Yonder is Germany, with her metaphysical
   skepticism, her half-Romanism, that is to say, Lutheranism--and her
   abounding Popery! How is she to arise? "Not by might, nor by power, but
   by My Spirit, says the Lord." Away there in Italy sits old Rome, the
   harlot of the seven hills, still reigning queen triumphant over the
   great part of the earth! How is she to die? Where is the sword which
   shall find out her heart? "Not by might, nor by power, but by My
   Spirit, says the Lord."

   The one thing, then, which we need, is the Spirit of God! Do not say
   that we need money--we shall have it soon enough when the Spirit
   touches men's hearts. Do not say that we need buildings, Churches,
   edifices--all these may be very well in subservience--but the main need
   of the Church is the Spirit and men into whom the Spirit may be poured!
   If there were only one prayer which I might pray before I died, it
   should be this: "Lord, send to Your Church men filled with the Holy
   Spirit and with fire." Give to any denomination such men and its
   progress must be mighty--keep back such men, send them college
   gentlemen of great refinement and profound learning, but of little fire
   and Grace--dumb dogs which cannot bark--and straightway that
   denomination must decline. Let the Spirit come and the preacher may be
   rustic, simple, rough, unmannered--but the Holy Spirit being upon
   him--none of his adversaries shall stand against him! His word shall be
   with power to the shaking of the gates of Hell!

   Beloved, did I not say well when I said that the Spirit of God is of
   superlative importance to the Church and that the day of Pentecost
   seems to tell us this? Remember, Brethren, and here is another thought
   which should make the Spirit very dear to you--without the Holy Spirit
   no good thing ever did or ever can come into any of your hearts--no
   sigh of penitence! No cry of faith! No glance of love! No tear of
   hallowed sorrow! Your heart can never palpitate with Divine life except
   through the Spirit! You are not capable of the smallest degree of
   spiritual emotion, much less spiritual action, apart from the Holy
   Spirit! Dead you lie, living only for evil, and absolutely dead for God
   until the Holy Spirit comes and raises you from the grave!

   There is nothing good in you today, my Brothers and Sisters, which was
   not put there. The flowers of Christ are all exotics--"In me, that is,
   in my flesh, dwells no good thing." Who can bring a clean thing out of
   an unclean? No one! Everything must come from Christ and Christ gives
   nothing to men except through the Spirit of all Grace. Prize, then, the
   Spirit as the channel of all good which comes into you. And further, no
   good thing can come out of you apart from the Spirit. Let it be in you,
   yet it lies dormant except God works in you to will and to do of His
   own good pleasure. Do you desire to preach? How can you unless the Holy
   Spirit touches your tongue? Do you desire to pray? Alas, what dull work
   it is unless the Spirit makes intercession for you! Do you desire to
   subdue sin? Would you be holy? Would you imitate your Master? Do you
   desire to rise to superlative heights of spirituality? Are you wanting
   to be made like the angels of God, full of zeal and ardor for the
   Master's cause? You cannot without the Spirit--"Without Me you can do
   nothing."

   O branch of the vine, you can have no fruit without the sap! O child of
   God, you have no life within you apart from the life which God gives
   you through His Spirit! Said I not well, then, that the Holy Spirit is
   superlatively precious, so that even the Presence of Christ after the
   flesh is not to be compared to His Presence for glory and for power?

   IV. This brings us to the conclusion, which is a practical point.
   Brethren, if these things are so, let us, who are believers in Christ,
   view the mysterious Spirit with deep awe and reverence. Let us so
   reverence Him as not to grieve Him or provoke Him to anger by our sins.
   Let us not quench Him in one of His faintest motions in our soul. Let
   us foster every suggestion and be ready to obey every prompting. If the
   Holy Spirit is, indeed, so mighty, let us do nothing without Him. Let
   us begin no project and carry on no enterprise and conclude no
   transaction without imploring His blessing. Let us pay Him the due
   homage of feeling our entire weakness apart from Him, and then
   depending alone upon Him, having this for our prayer, "Open my heart
   and my whole being to Your incoming and uphold me with Your free Spirit
   when I shall have received that Spirit in my inward parts."

   You who are unconverted, let me beseech you, whatever you do, never
   despise the Spirit of God. Remember, there is a special honor put upon
   Him in Scripture--"All manner of sin and of blasphemy shall be forgiven
   unto men, but the sin against the Holy Spirit shall never be forgiven,
   neither in this world nor in that which is to come." Remember, "If a
   man speaks a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him. But
   if he speaks a word against the Holy Spirit, it shall never be forgiven
   him." This is the sin which is unto death, of which even the loving
   John says--"I do not say that you shall pray for it." Tremble,
   therefore, in His Presence! Take your shoes off, for when His name is
   mentioned, the place where you stand is holy ground. Let the Spirit be
   treated with reverence.

   In the next place, as a practical remark, let us, viewing the might of
   the Spirit, take courage today. We know, Brethren, that we, as a body
   of people seeking to adhere closely to Scripture and to practice the
   ordinances and hold the doctrines as we have received them from the
   Lord Himself, are but poor and despised. And when we look at the great
   ones of the earth, we see them on the side of the false and not of the
   true. Where are the kings and the nobles? Where are the princes, and
   where are the mighty men?

   Are they not against the Lord of Hosts. Where is the gold? Where is the
   silver? Where is the architecture? Where is the wisdom? Where is the
   eloquence? Is it not banded against the Lord of Hosts? What? Shall we,
   then, be discouraged? Our fathers were not! They bore their testimony
   in the stocks and in the prison, but they feared not for the good old
   cause! As John Bunyan, they learned to rot in dungeons, but they
   learned not to play the coward. They suffered and they testified that
   they were not discouraged. Why? Because they knew (not that Truth is
   mighty and will prevail, for Truth is not mighty and will not prevail
   in this world until men are different from what they are), but they
   knew that the Spirit of God is mighty and will prevail!

   Better to have a small Church of poor men and the Spirit of God with
   them, than to have a hierarchy of nobles, to have an army of titled
   princes and prelates without the Holy Spirit! For this is not merely
   the sinew of strength, but it is strength itself! Where the Spirit of
   God is--there is liberty and power! Courage then, Brethren! We have
   only to seek for that which God has promised to give and we can do
   wonders. He will give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him. Wake up,
   members of this Church, to earnest prayer. And all Believers throughout
   the world, cry aloud unto God to let His bare arm be seen. Wake,
   children of God, for you know the power ofprayer!

   Give the Covenant angel no rest till he speaks the word and the Spirit
   works mightily among the sons of men. Prayer is work adapted to each of
   you who are in Christ. You cannot preach, you cannot teach, but you can
   pray! And your private prayer, unknown by men, shall be registered in
   Heaven, Those silent but earnest cries of yours shall bring down a
   blessing. The other morning, when we were holding special prayer, there
   were some Brethren present who kept saying during the prayer to
   themselves, scarcely loud enough to be heard, "Do Lord! Do! Grant it!
   Hear it!" That is a kind of praying which I love in Prayer Meetings!

   I would not care for the loud shouts of some of our Methodist Brethren,
   though if they like they are welcome to it. But I do like to hear
   friends praying with the groaning which cannot be uttered, "Lord, send
   the Spirit! Send the Spirit, Lord! Work! Work! Work!" During sermon
   time it is what numbers of Churches should be doing, crying out to God
   in their hearts. As you walk the streets when you see sin you should
   pray, "Lord, put it down by Your Spirit!" And when you mark a
   struggling Brother striving to do good, you should cry, "Lord, help
   him! Help him by Your Spirit." I am persuaded we only need more prayer
   and there is no limit to the blessing! You may evangelize England, you
   may evangelize Europe, you may Christianize the world--if you do but
   know how to pray.

   Prayer can get anything of God, prayer can get everything--God denies
   nothing to the man who knows how to ask. The Lord never shuts His
   storehouse till you shut your mouth! God will never stop His arm till
   you stop your tongue. Cry aloud and spare not! Give Him no rest till He
   sends forth His Spirit once again to stir the waters and to brood over
   this dark world till light and life shall come! Cry day and night, O
   you elect of God, for He will avenge you speedily. The time of battle
   draws near! Rome sharpens her sword for the fight! The men of error
   gnash their teeth in rage! Now for the sword of the Lord and of Gideon!
   Now for the old might and majesty of the ancient days! Now for the
   shaking of the walls of Jericho, even though we have no better weapons
   than rams' horns! Now for the driving out of the heathen, and for the
   establishment of God's Israel in the land! Now for the coming of the
   Holy Spirit with such might and power that as Noah's flood covered the
   mountaintops, Jehovah's flood of Glory shall cover the highest summits
   of sin and iniquity and the whole world over, the Lord God Omnipotent
   shall reign!

   You who have not the Spirit pray for it. May He prompt you to pray this
   morning! Unconverted Sinners, may the Spirit give you faith! Remember
   that the Holy Spirit tells you to trust Christ. If you honor the Holy
   Spirit, trust Christ. I know you must be regenerate, for the man who
   trusts Christ is regenerate. You must repent, you must be holy, but the
   man who trusts Christ shall repent and shall be made holy. The germs of
   repentance and holiness are in him already. Trust Christ, Sinner! It is
   the Holy Spirit's mandate to you this morning. May He constrain you to
   trust Him and He shall have the Glory, world without end. Amen.

                       The Pierced One Pierces The Heart

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JUNE 19, 1864, BY THE REV. C. H. SPURGEON,
   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And I will pour upon the house of Da vid and upon the inhabitants of
   Jerusalem, the spirit of Grace and of supplications: and they shall
   look upon Me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for Him, as
   one mourns for his only son and shall be in bitterness for Him, as one
   that is in bitterness for his first-born." Zechariah 12:10.

   THIS prophecy, first of all, refers to the Jewish people. And I am
   happy that it confirms our hearts in the belief of the good which the
   Lord will do unto Israel. We know of a surety, because God has said it,
   that the Jews will be restored to their own land and that they shall
   inherit the goodly country which the Lord has given unto their fathers
   by a Covenant of salt forever. But, better still, they shall be
   converted to the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ and shall see in Him
   the house of David restored to the throne of Israel. The day is coming
   when they shall see in Jesus of Nazareth, that Messiah for whom their
   saints looked with joyful expectation, of whom the Prophets spoke with
   rapture, but who was despised and rejected of their blinded sires.

   Happy day! Happy day! When our Jewish Brethren shall all be found
   worshipping before the Lord of Hosts through their great High Priest,
   who is a Priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek! We must
   remember the prophecy concerning this thing. We must enquire of the
   Lord concerning His promise. We must expect its fulfillment, labor for
   it and then beyond a doubt, when the due season shall have arrived,
   Israel shall own her king and upon the house of David and the
   inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of Grace and supplication shall be
   poured out.

   We intend to hear our text, upon the present occasion, as it speaks to
   ourselves. A great mistake is very common among all classes of men--it
   is currently believed that we are, first of all, to mourn for our sins
   and then to look by faith to our Lord Jesus Christ. Most persons who
   have any concern about their souls but are not as yet enlightened by
   the Spirit of God think that there is a degree of tenderness of
   conscience and of hatred of sin which they are to obtain, somehow or
   other, and then they will be permitted and authorized to look to Jesus
   Christ. Now you will perceive that this is not according to the
   Scripture, for, according to the text before us men first look upon Him
   whom they have pierced and then, but not till then, they mourn for
   their sin!

   This is the common folly of men--they look for the effect in order to
   produce the cause. They forget the old proverb and put the cart before
   the horse. But our text plainly indicates what is the cause, and puts
   it first, assuring us that the effect will follow. Repentance is in no
   sense a title to faith in Christ. It is, on the other hand, a
   legitimate consequence of faith. In certain diseases the surgeon aims
   at producing an outward eruption which carries off the internal poison
   and so assists in the cure. But no man would be justified in refraining
   from medical advice until he could see the eruption in his skin--that
   being a healthy sign, a prognostic of cure--a result of medicine, and
   by no means a preparation for it.

   So repentance is the bringing into our own sight the sin which lurks
   within. It is a result of the medicine of faith. But we should be
   foolish, indeed, if we refused to believe until we saw in ourselves
   that repentance which only faith can produce! That repentance which is
   unattended by faith in the Lord Jesus is an evil repentance which works
   wrath and only sets the soul at a greater distance from God than it was
   before. Sweet, heart-melting, reconciling repentance brings the soul to
   love the Lord and to hope in His mercy--this precious gem always
   glitters on the hand of faith and nowhere else.

   Without faith it is impossible to please God. And consequently an
   unbelieving repentance has nothing in it acceptable to God. Unbelieving
   repentance may be so deep as to drive us to hang ourselves, like Judas,
   but its only result would be to secure for us Judas's doom. Without
   faith, if our hearts could break--if our eyes could become perpetual
   fountains of tears--our repentance would in no way whatever be regarded
   by God except as a continuance of our sin. We would really be rejecting
   the Lord Jesus and setting up our own bitterness of soul in competition
   with the finished work of our

   Lord Jesus Christ. Let us be quite clear on this point, then, to start
   with, that it is not mourning for sin which causes or prepares the way
   for our looking to Christ.

   It is our looking to Jesus which makes us weep and mourn for Him and
   works in us the sweet bitterness of true repentance. We will consider
   three points--first, what there is in a sight of the Pierced One to
   make us mourn. Secondly, what is the character of true mourning for
   sin. And thirdly, what is that which connects Jesus and this true
   mourning. The text tells us that looking does it all--"They shall look
   upon Me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for Him."

   I. WHAT IS THERE IN A SIGHT OF JESUS TO MAKE US MOURN FOR SIN? Let us
   not answer this question merely in a doctrinal fashion. But as we
   proceed let us pray that the Holy Spirit may bring our minds to feel
   the melting force of the great Sacrifice on Calvary so that we may
   bedew His Cross with tears of holy penitence. Come with me, Brethren,
   to Golgotha's terrible mount of doom that we may sit down and watch the
   death-pangs of the great Lover of men's souls. There on that transverse
   wood bleeds the Incarnate Son of God. His head yields ruby drops where
   the crown of thorns has pierced it.

   His hands and feet flow with rivulets of blood. His back is all one
   wound. His face is marred with bruises and filthy with the spittle of
   the mockers. His hair has been plucked from His cheeks. His eyes are
   bloodshot. His lips are parched with fever. His whole body is a mass of
   concentrated agony. He hangs yonder in physical pain impossible to be
   fully described, while the misery of His soul, crushed beneath the
   wheels of the chariot of Justice, constitutes a woe far more terrible.
   His soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death, while His body is
   as a cup full to the brim with grief--what if I say a sponge saturated
   with infinite miseries?

   While Jesus bleeds on yonder tree, our hearts bleed, too. If we have
   tears at any time, let us shed them now, for now or never must we weep.
   The first cause for deep sorrow lies in the excellency of the
   Sufferer's Person. He who hangs there is no other than that Son of God
   before whom angels veil their faces with their wings. He is Lord of
   Heaven and earth-- concerning Him the Father said of old, "Let all the
   angels of God worship Him." At His behests the cherubim and seraphim
   fly to the utmost verge of space, glad to be the messengers of His good
   pleasure. He is the Light and Brightness of Heaven, the express Image
   of his Father's Glory.

   "Without Him was not anything made that was made," and by Him all
   things consist. And yet the King of Heaven lays aside His crown, strips
   Himself of His purple, takes off His golden rings, becomes an Infant of
   a span long and after a life of suffering yields Himself to a slave's
   death upon the wretched gibbet of the Cross! My Soul, do you not sorrow
   that so Divine a Person should sink so low? Think of the purity of His
   Character as Man! In Him was never any sin and yet He suffers! His
   whole life was spent in doing good. Unselfishly He spared not Himself.

   And now men do not spare Him their worst cruelty! He gives food to the
   hungry, health to the sick, life to the dead. He has not time for
   Himself so much as to eat bread. He shuns no labor for the good of
   others. He seeks no ease for Himself. And yet the men whom He would
   bless conspire to curse Him! He lives a life of perfect holiness, in no
   way causing any to offend. His life is the pure light of the sun of
   love, it has no darkness whatever in it. His acts are as a river
   flowing with crystal streams of loving kindness, untainted by
   selfishness or ambition. And yet He bleeds! Heaven's brightest Jewel is
   cast into the mire--earth's purest Gold is trod in the streets. He who
   is of Heaven the Sun, suffers an eclipse! He who is of earth the
   brightest Star, is hidden beneath black clouds.

   O You Immaculate Man, shall I see You bleed without compassion? O You
   Almighty God, shall I see You Incarnate in the flesh, suffering throes
   and pangs unworthy of Your Godhead, without feeling the commiseration
   of my soul stirred towards You? Can we, Brethren, think of the beauty
   of our Lord without being filled with bitterness of soul for Him? Shall
   those eyes which are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters,
   which once were washed with milk, now be drowned in tears of blood? His
   cheeks, which are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers--shall these be
   given to them that pluck off the hair? Those hands which are set with
   jewels, shall they be pierced? Shall His legs, which are as pillars of
   marble set upon sockets of fine gold become all bespattered with the
   stream of His heart's gore?

   Oh, here is sorrow if you will! That precious casket of His body, so
   rich that Heaven's treasures and earth's wealth together could not
   furnish such another! That dear case of jewels is cast out as an
   unclean thing and made a Victim without the camp! O, who will give me
   tears? I weep, I must weep for my sins!--

   "My sins, my hateful, cruel sins, His chief tormentors were!
   Each of my crimes became a nail, And unbelief the spear. 'Twas you that
   pulled the vengeance down, Upon his guiltless head, Break, break my
   heart! O burst my eyes, And let my sorrows bleed."

   All human eyes, if they were forever full of tears, could not express
   the woe that One so glorious, so pure, so loving, so condescending,
   should in His own world find no shelter, and among His own creatures
   find no friends! But contrariwise, in this world be racked upon the
   Cross and among His creatures meet His murderers! This should make us
   mourn bitterly for sin.

   Look up again, my Soul, and perhaps another word may help to melt you,
   stubborn though you are. Let us remind ourselves of His sufferings.
   Remember Gethsemane? In that garden His soul is exceedingly sorrowful.
   Though He is not in labor, but simply in the exercise of prayer, a
   sweat comes streaming from every pore--not the common sweat of men who
   toil, but, O God, it is a sweat of blood! "He sweat, as it were, great
   drops of blood falling down to the ground." The pains of Hell alone can
   furnish a fit parallel for the awful misery of Christ that night. And
   perhaps even there such sufferings were never sustained as Christ
   endured in the garden! Betrayed by His chosen friend, He is hurried
   away to the Sanhedrim and there accused of blasphemy.

   Oh, cruel charge against the Son of the Highest! Then He is dragged
   away to Pilate and then away to Herod, to be slandered before both
   tribunals. Meanwhile, they scourge His back with the scourge, the very
   thought of which is enough to make a man shudder--it is said to have
   been made of the sinews of oxen intertwisted with pieces of sharp and
   ragged bone--so that every blow tore through the flesh to the very
   bone. He is scourged thus and then beaten with rods. He is set upon a
   mimic throne and crowned with thorns. They spit in His face. They
   insult His Person. They bow the knee and say, "Hail, King of the Jews."
   They buffet Him with their hands. Shame never descended to a lower
   depth--mockery could devise nothing worse than that crown of thorns and
   that reed scepter.

   Away they hound Him, tearing off the purple robe which must have glued
   itself to His bleeding flesh--they roughly tear it away. And then they
   put on His own garments and hasten Him to the malefactor's Tyburn.
   Rudely they strip Him. Cruelly they fling Him down. Savagely they
   pierce His hands and His feet. They lift up His Cross and dislocate His
   every bone with the jar given to it, as it is fastened in the earth.
   They sit down to look at Him in derision and gloat over His pains. The
   weight of the body tears the nails through His hands and when the
   weight falls upon His feet, the nails force themselves in long wounds
   through the nerves of His blessed feet!

   Fever is brought on by His fearful wounds. He is faint with pain. His
   mouth is dried like an oven. In His extremity, He cries, "I thirst!"
   They thrust vinegar into His mouth--that is the only comfort they will
   render Him--vinegar mingled with gall! The hot sun scorches Him until
   He cries, "All My bones are out of joint: My heart is like wax. It is
   melted in the midst of My bowels. My strength is dried up like a
   potsherd. And My tongue cleaves to My jaws. And You have brought Me
   into the dust of death."

   Even the light is denied Him. He hangs shivering in midday-midnight.
   The thick darkness did but express the darkness which might be felt
   which covered all His soul. His agonies had become so intense that they
   must not be beheld by any onlooker. The darkness, therefore, formed as
   it were, a secret chamber wherein Christ might do battle with His
   direst griefs. Griefs like Himself, immense, unknown. Godlike sorrows
   now hold fast the Son of God--only His Deity enabled Him to sustain the
   struggle. The storm passes and at last, shouting, "It is finished,"
   with bowed head, He gives up the ghost.

   Have we no tears for such sorrows as these? Shall we have no mourning
   for such griefs? How is it that if we read the story of a common man,
   suffering by his own folly, we freely weep? And over the silly story of
   a love-sick maid we will feel our pity stirred? But here on Calvary,
   where the King of Heaven is tortured with unutterable woe, tormented
   with sorrows so tremendous that they overtop all other griefs as a
   mountain exceeds the molehills, we are like flints or steel and
   scarcely feel compassion move? O God, pour out upon us the spirit of
   grief and commiseration, that we may mourn for Him--

   "Strike, mighty Grace, my flinty soul,
   Till melting waters flow,
   And deep repentance drowns my eyes
   In agonizing woe."

   Perhaps we have not come to the very center of heart-breaking thought.
   The wonder is that Jesus Christ should suffer thus as the result of
   sin--of our sin. A young man ran away from home and left his aged
   mother that he might plunge into sin--after a few shameful years he
   came back to his country and sought his home. When he knocked at the
   cottage door he asked for his mother, but she was not there. "What name
   did you say, Sir? She died years ago." "And how did she die?" Well,
   they say she had a son who treated her with cruelty and at last left
   her to indulge his own evil passions. She could not bear it, for she
   loved him much. She sickened and no one could comfort her. She died,
   they say, of a broken heart. And that is her grave over the hedge
   yonder in the Churchyard."

   Well might the sinner turn away with reeling brain and wish himself
   under the turf at her side. "I slew my mother by my sins." If he weeps
   not at this he must be a devil, indeed. Jesus Christ, my Lord, hangs on
   that tree slain by my sins-- shall I not sorrow now? Had I never
   sinned, there had been no need of a Savior for me. Had we never
   rebelled against God, there would have been no sword of vengeance to
   plunge into His heart--

   "Was it for crimes that I had done He groaned upon the tree?"

   This is sad, indeed. Can you get the thought, my dear Friends, that you
   made Christ die--yes, you--if there were no other man. You could not,
   if there had been only you to save--you could not enter Heaven without
   the dying groans of that Savior. There must be an Atonement made no
   less than His great Sacrifice for you and you alone. Therefore take the
   whole of it to yourself, and now, will you not sorrow at the sight of
   the pierced Savior?

   Let us remember, too, as we continue at the foot of the Cross, that
   Jesus Christ does not merely suffer for sin but He suffers FOR YOU. I
   do not know, but perhaps this may be the heart-breaker with some who
   never did repent of sin before. O you who look to Him believingly,
   Jesus Christ loves your poor guilty soul at such a rate that He suffers
   all this for you! I pray you as you look to Him dying upon the Cross,
   forget not that every drop yonder flows for you. How could you have
   despised Him who died for you! Determined to save you He went down to
   the very lowest depths to bring you up and yet you have heard the
   Gospel and neglected it! You have lived all these years in sin! You
   have been day after day a neglector of the Word of God, perhaps a
   Sunday-breaker! It may be a swearer, using this very name of Christ to
   curse by and yet He suffered this for you.

   O believing Sinner, for you these wounds, for you that sweat of gore,
   for you that Cross, for you that spear, for you that mangled frame
   lying in the tomb motionless in the grasp of death! Will not this make
   you feel that you cannot any longer harbor the lusts which are the
   enemies of Christ, but that you must cast out, once and for all from
   your soul, these cruel foes which made the Savior bleed? While I am
   talking upon this theme, I feel more than at any other time in my own
   life my own insufficiency. I cry as Elijah did, "Woe is me! For I am
   undone, because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of
   a people of unclean lips!"

   O, it needs an angel's tongue to tell out a Savior's grief! Yes, even a
   seraph might fail. It needs the Savior Himself to tell you in worthy
   words how He suffered and what was the love which led Him through the
   woe. Surely the Cross makes sin hateful when we see it by the light of
   the Spirit of all Truth. One more remark here upon this first point. It
   should make us mourn for sin when we think that this suffering of
   Christ for us can be attributed to nothing else than His own marvelous
   love towards us who were so undeserving. What could have brought Christ
   from on high except motives of pure affection? Can you conjecture any
   other cause? Did He want Glory?

   My Brothers and Sisters, was not the Glory of Heaven enough for Him?
   Besides, if it could have been possible for Him to need Glory, is He
   not Omnipotent? Could He not, in a moment, have created ten thousand
   thousand worlds filled with inhabitants all too glad to be permitted to
   sing His praise? Could He gain anything, let me ask you, by coming here
   below? And was there anything in you or me to merit what He did? Far,
   far away be the accursed thought of my merit! But even if we could
   merit anything, could we merit this Sacrifice? Could we merit that
   bloody sweat? O Virtue, you could never merit this! No, heroism at its
   highest point and self-sacrifice sublime to its most exalted degree
   could never merit that the Son of God should die!

   Sin accomplished what Virtue could not. Sin brings the Savior from on
   high--Virtue never could have procured this. Ah, Brethren, the love of
   Jesus must have been a strange love, indeed. We have heard of men who
   out of love to some poor countrywoman have left their kingdom and their
   throne to follow her poverty and lift her up ultimately to their
   wealth. But who ever heard of the equal of this? That God's own Son,
   "though He was rich, yet for our sakes He became poor, that through His
   poverty we might be made rich"? Worms were never raised so high above
   their meanest fellow worms and therefore they could never stoop as
   Christ did! If an angel could die for ants, that would look like
   condescension--but for Christ to die for men is more wondrous by far!

   If the noblest cherubim before the Throne should shed his heart's blood
   for a poor insect, you would think it marvelous! But for God Himself to
   take a creature's form, to bleed for such insignificant, despicable,
   worthless things as men-- this is a wonder which has set Heaven ringing
   ever since it was known and will make eternity echo with shouts of
   praise. Surely, dear Friends, if nothing else can make us loathe sin
   and weep before God, this should do so. And yet, I confess, I spoil the
   theme. When Mark Anthony brings out the body of Julius Caesar, he
   excites the sympathies of the Roman people by the sight of the mantle
   of the murdered man.

   He makes them weep and then he cries, "What? Do you weep when you but
   behold your Caesar's vesture wounded! Look you here--here is
   himself--marred, as you see, by traitors." Such speech puts tongues
   into the silent stones of Rome! Whereas, alas, I, poor worthless
   creature as I am, talk of my Master, stabbed by ourselves, bleeding out
   of love to us, at so poor a rate that I cannot stir your souls, nor
   scarce my own! Almighty Spirit, well is it written that You will come
   to give the spirit of supplication, for except You shall come, we shall
   neither look to Christ, nor weep, nor mourn because of Him!

   II. Secondly WE ARE TO SPEAK UPON WHAT TRUE MOURNING FOR SIN IS. It is
   not necessarily feeling great terrors nor frightful tears. There is no
   need that you should doubt the mercy of God--all these things may come
   with repentance, as smoke attends fire, but they are not a part of it.
   They often spoil repentance--they cannot make it more acceptable.

   1. True mourning for sin is the work of the Spirit of God. There is no
   mourning until first the Spirit is poured out. Then men look and then
   they mourn. Repentance is too choice a flower to grow in Nature's
   garden. If you have one sigh after Christ--if you have one particle of
   hatred of sin--God the Holy Spirit must have given it to you, for poor
   human nature with its utmost strain can never reach to a spiritual
   thing. "That which is born of the flesh is flesh. And that which is
   born of the Spirit is spirit." True repentance, then, must come from on
   high. Lord, send it to us now!

   2. True repentance has a distinct and constant reference to the Lord
   Jesus Christ. If you repent of sin without looking to Christ, away with
   your repentance! If you are so lamenting your sin as to forget the
   Savior, you have need to begin all this work over again. Whenever we
   repent of sin we must have one eye upon sin and another upon the Cross.
   Or, better still, let us have both eyes upon Christ, seeing our sin
   punished in Him and by no means let us look at sin except as we look at
   Jesus. A man may hate sin just as a murderer hates the gallows--but
   this does not prove repentance. If I hate sin because of the
   punishment, I have not repented of sin--I merely regret that God is
   just.

   But if I can see sin as an offense against Jesus Christ and loathe
   myself because I have wounded Him, then I have a true brokenness of
   heart. If I see the Savior and believe that those thorns upon His head
   were plaited by my sinful words. If I believe that those wounds in His
   heart were pierced by my heart sins. If I believe that those wounds in
   His feet were made by my wandering steps and that the wounds in His
   hands were made by my sinful deeds--then I repent of sin after a right
   fashion. Only under the Cross can you repent. Repentance elsewhere is
   remorse which clings to the sin and only dreads the punishment. Let us
   then seek, under God, to have a hatred of sin caused by a sight of
   Christ's love.

   3. True repentance is real and often intense in its bitterness. The
   text tells us it is a sorrow like that of one who weeps for his only
   son. A son is a gift from God. A good son, especially, is a treasure to
   his father's heart. But here is a dead son before me--I think I hear
   the father's cries, "O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would
   God I had died for you, O Absalom, my son, my son!" Here I see an only
   son, which was not David's case, for he had Solomon yet spared to him.

   I think I see the woman at the gate of Nain with her only son carried
   out to be buried, making much lamentation, with grievous pomp of
   heartfelt woe. Yes, and it is not only that, it is the first-born son,
   the beginning of the father's strength. And the man who has watched him
   and seen himself in his first-born's growing form, will not be
   comforted because his son--his only son, his first-born son is dead.
   Such is true weeping for sin--it cuts to the heart--it pierces to the
   quick.

   "Oh," says one, "I cannot believe in Christ, for I have no such
   bitterness." My dear Friend, you never will have it till you believe in
   Christ! You are to trust in Jesus Christ to get this! You are not to
   feel this and then trust in Christ. Come, you hard Heart, come to
   Christ to be softened. Come, you Hell-hardened Steel, come to Christ to
   be melted in the furnace of His Divine affection. Come as you are,
   Sinner, feeling or unfeeling and look up to Jesus! There is life in a
   look at Him and life for you now. And the first sign of life will be a
   real and intense sorrow for sin.

   4. True sorrow for sin is eminently practical. No man may say he hates
   sin if he lives in it. It will make us see the evil of sin, not merely
   as a theory, but experimentally--as a burnt child dreads fire. We shall
   be as much afraid of it as a man who has lately been stopped and robbed
   is afraid of the thief upon the highway. And we shall shun it--shun it
   in every-thing--not in great things only, but in little things, too.
   True mourning for sin will make us very jealous over our tongue lest it
   should say a wrong word. We shall be very watchful over our daily
   actions lest in anything we should offend. And each night we shall
   close the day with painful confessions of shortcoming and each morning
   awaken with anxious prayers, that this next day God would hold us up
   that we might be saved.

   5. Once again, true repentance is continual--a man does not repent for
   a few weeks and then have done with it. Rowland Hill said that
   repentance was one of the sweetest earthly companions. And the only
   regret he had in the thought of going to Heaven was that his dear
   friend, Repentance, could not go with him there. Repentance is the most
   heavenly thing out of Heaven. Well did our hymn say--

   "Lord, let me weep for nothing but sin!
   And after none but You!
   And then I would--
   O that I might--
   A constant weeper be!"

   True Believers repent to their dying day--they are always repenting.
   Their life is made up, it is said, of sinning and repenting--I will not
   say that--believing and repenting is their life--and sin is the disease
   which mars it. No time can wear away the bitterness of repentance. If a
   man loses his child, time happily softens his grief. Every other
   trouble yields to time, but this never does. It is so sweet a sorrow
   that we can only thank God we are permitted to enjoy and to suffer it
   until we enter into our eternal rest.

   This, then, is true sorrow for sin. But let me say, whatever is or is
   not true sorrow for sin, I do entreat my hearers not to try and get
   sorrow for sin before they come to Christ. The Gospel is, "He that
   BELIEVES in Jesus is not condemned." Whether you have sorrowed enough
   for sin or not, if you trust Jesus Christ, you are not condemned. Your
   salvation is not procured by your tears, nor by your feelings, but by
   Him whom you have pierced! Look to Him, away from self. Look not even
   to your own faith, but look to the Object of your faith. Now fixedly
   behold Him and trust Him and your heart will break and be poured out
   like water before the Lord.

   III. WHAT IS THAT WHICH CONNECTS JESUS CHRIST AND THE MOURNING? How am
   I to get at Christ?

   This used to puzzle me. I thought if I could walk a thousand miles to
   see Him, I would set off joyously. Oh, if I could but fall at His feet
   and lay hold of Him! I thought this would be very easy--touching the
   hem of His garment--or crying, "God be merciful to me!" But this
   thought long puzzled me--"How can I get to Christ?" So many fleshly
   notions mix themselves with our thoughts before we are born again that
   we are very much like poor Nicodemus and say, "Can a man enter his
   mother's womb a second time, and be born again?"

   We have gross and carnal thoughts concerning spiritual things. Now, our
   connection with Jesus is a look, not with these eyes, of course, but
   with the eyes of the heart. We all know what it is to look at a thing.
   We are told to look at a certain subject in politics or science--we are
   told to look into it. There is nothing to see with your eyes, but you
   see into it with your mind. And this is the kind of look which is
   intended here, "They shall look upon Me whom they have pierced."

   You cannot, with all your looking, see Christ with these eyes! But
   thinking of Him and believing in Him is the look which is meant. In
   describing this look, let me say that it is very simple. Why, looking
   is not a hard thing! I never heard of a college for training people to
   look. I never in my life heard of anyone trying to teach another person
   to look! There may be a defect in people's eyes, but still if they have
   any eyes at all, they may look. They may happen to have cross eyes, but
   a crossed-eyed look at Christ will save the soul. They may have a
   waterfall in the eye, so that there is scarcely a corner left, but it
   is not looking with a full eye, it is not looking with a bold eye--it
   is the looking in any way--the simple act of looking which saves a
   soul.

   A man may not be able to read a single letter in a book, but he can
   look to Jesus. A man may not be able to spell a word of one syllable,
   but he can look. A man may have no moral courage, but he can look. He
   may be destitute of all the virtues and yet he can look. A man may be a
   thief, a whoremonger, an adulterer, but he can look. A man may be cast
   out of society, transported, shut up between stone walls, but he can
   look. Looking is a thing so simple that neither moral nor physical
   preparations are required. Looking! Such is faith in Jesus Christ. As
   the sin-bitten ones looked to the brazen serpent so do we look away
   from self to Christ and we live!

   Observe, secondly, as it is a simple look so it is a look which
   requires no merit in order to precede it. We have an old proverb, to
   wit, "a cat may look at a king," and certainly a poor man may. There is
   no hurt done by looking. If the queen were here, I should not ask her
   leave to let me look. And if there were a crossing sweeper, or a
   mud-lark, or even a pickpocket here, he certainly would commit no
   offense by looking. On the other hand, there would be no merit in
   looking. Where is the merit of looking at a thing? It is too simple
   either to need merit before it or to have merit in it.

   So you who are the worst of the worst! You who feel nothing in yourself
   which is good! You who can not even say that you feel your own
   emptiness and vileness--nothing of your own is needed to precede that
   look by way of preparation. Look, look to Jesus as you are, and you
   shall be saved! The look which saves the soul, again, should be an
   attentive look. If you have looked to Christ and cannot see anything
   there to comfort you, look again! Look again! Perhaps each man is
   comforted in a different way by looking to Christ. One sees Christ to
   be God and he says, "Ah, then, He can save me." Another dwells mainly
   upon Christ's being Man and he says, "Ah, then, He can pity me and be
   willing to receive me."

   One fixes his eyes upon God's having appointed Christ to save him--that
   comforts him. Another remembers the infinite value of Christ's
   sufferings and that cheers him. If one point in Christ does not comfort
   you, look to another. Keep your mental eyes fixed upon what Jesus
   Christ is. Ah, my dear Friends, I am telling you this, but how
   difficult it is to make you do it until the Holy Spirit brings you! Why
   the first thing I get from any of you when I talk to you about your
   souls is, "O Sir, I do not feel." I know then that you are looking to
   self. O my dear Hearers, you who have some concern about your souls, I
   would beseech my God to wean you from this which must damn your
   souls--this looking to SELF!

   Come, I pray you, consider! You are too vile, too sinful ever to have
   anything good in you to look at! Why will you search for goodness where
   there is none? "Why do you spend money for that which is not bread? And
   labor for that which satisfies not? Hearken diligently unto Me and eat
   that which is good and let your soul delight itself in fatness." You
   can do so if you look at the Cross! I know you will raise your "buts,"
   or cry, "But I cannot believe." There you are, looking to your faith
   instead of Christ. There He hangs! He bears upon His shoulders the sin
   of man and whoever trusts Him shall be saved. Can you not trust Him?
   Not trust your God? Can you not trust Him, your Brother born to bear
   your adversities? Not trust GOD? Why I protest before you all if I had
   all your sins upon my shoulders, I could trust Him!

   When John Hyatt lay a-dying, someone said to him, "Can you trust Jesus
   with your soul now?" "Ah," said he, "I could trust Him if I had a
   million souls! I could trust Him with them all." Do not tell me,
   awakened Souls, you cannot trust your Master! When did He ever lie to
   you? Whom did He ever cast out? When did He break His promise? Who ever
   came to Him and was rejected? When did He say to the chief of sinners,
   "Your sins shall never be forgiven"? Thousands have been to Him and He
   has received them.

   I sought the Lord and He heard me. I tried to save myself by feelings
   of repentance and praying, but it was all of no avail. At last, in
   sheer despair, I flew like a dove pursued by the hawk straight away to
   Jesus Christ, the Rock, and found shelter in His wounds. O that you
   would do so! Come, I pray you, have done with that self of yours--

   "None but Jesus, none but Jesus Can do helpless sinners good."

   This look is sometimes a wondering look--I know it was to me. When I
   saw Him hanging on the Cross for me, I could not understand such love,
   and I cannot fathom it now. I can understand some of the things which
   Christ has done for me. But I cannot make out why He should die for
   me--why He should love such a heap of filth, such a walking dunghill as
   man is! Why He should give His blood--every drop of which is more
   costly than rubies! Why He should give His tears, which are richer than
   diamonds! Why He should give His heart, which is better than a mine of
   gold! Why He should close those lips which are sweeter than harps of
   angels and shut those eyes, which are brighter than so many suns--and
   all for such a clod of earth, such a rebellious piece of rottenness as
   man! Oh, this is marvelous! How can we understand it? We can only fall
   down before His feet and while we trust Him add to our faith a holy
   adoring wonder!

   This look must, in every case, be a personal one. You cannot be saved
   by another man's faith. I do beseech of all to whom this word shall
   come--detest, loathe, abominate the lie that any man can perform
   spiritual acts for another! No "sponsor" can promise to renounce the
   works of the flesh for another! No man can stand at the font and
   declare that he believes for another! No man can promise that an
   unconscious slumbering baby shall believe in God. No man can say in
   God's name what he knows is a lie--that the child does believe--when it
   cannot believe and probably is asleep at the time and not occupied with
   any mental operation, much less believing what it never heard and what
   it could not understand if it did hear!

   O, I pray you, shun this blasphemy! The curse of England has been this
   dogma of baptismal regeneration, for it leads men to shake off their
   personal responsibility and obligations to God. Your godfathers and
   godmothers, your confirmation, your priests and rural deans and canons
   and I know not what of man's invention, can do no more for you than so
   many witches with their incantations. You must flee to Christ
   yourselves and by simple faith lay hold on Jesus! All this frippery and
   nonsense of man's invention must be pulled down! O for a rough hand to
   pull it down, to let the sinner see that he stands before God, naked
   and defenseless, except as he flees to Christ, and in the passion and
   life of Jesus, finds salvation!

   A personal faith it must be and what if I urge you to let it be an
   immediate faith? It will be no easier to flee tomorrow than it is
   today. It is the same thing that you will have to believe tomorrow as
   it is today--that Jesus Christ gave Himself for your sins. This is
   God's testimony, that Christ is able to save. O that you would trust
   Him! My Soul, you have regretted a thousand things, but you have never
   regretted trusting Christ in your youth! Many have wept that they did
   not come to Christ before, but none ever lamented that they came too
   early. Why not this very day? O Holy Spirit, make it so! Behold, the
   fields are showing the green ears ready for the harvest! The season
   advances and the fields are prophesying the harvest. O that we might
   see some green ears today, some green ears prophetic of a blessed
   harvest of souls!

   As to myself, I cross this day into another year of my own life and
   history and I bear witness that my Master is worth trusting! Oh, it is
   a blessed thing to be a Christian! It is a sweet thing to be a Believer
   in Christ and though I, of all men, perhaps, am the subject of the
   deepest depression of spirits at times, yet there lives not a soul who
   can say more truthfully than I, "My soul does magnify the Lord and my
   spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior." He who is mighty has looked upon
   me with eyes of love and made me His child and I trust Him this day as
   I have trusted Him before.

   But now I would to God that this day some of you would begin to trust
   in Him! It is the Spirit's work only, but still, He works through
   means. I think He is working in your heart now. Young Man, those tears
   look hopeful--I thank God that those eyes feel burning now. I pray you
   do not go chatting on the road home and miss any good impression. Go to
   your chamber, fall upon your knees, cry out to God, entreat His favor!
   This day let it be! None of the devil's tomorrows--away with them! Away
   with them!

   "Today if you will hear His voice, harden not your heart." May the
   Spirit of God constrain you to "Kiss the Son, lest He be angry and you
   perish from the Way, when His wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed
   are all they that put their trust in Him." Amen.

                                 Quiet Musing!

   A SERMON DELIVERED BY THE REV. C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN
   TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "While I was musing the fire burned." Psalm 39:3.

   OUR subject this evening will not stand in need of much preface. The
   Psalm may teach us that there are times when solitude is better than
   society and silence is wiser than speech. The company of sinners was a
   grief to David's soul and because their converse was profane he chose,
   rather, to fly away from their midst--or if they must still continue in
   his presence, he determined that he would resolutely seal his lips.
   Touchingly he says, "I was dumb with silence (that is, utterly dumb), I
   held my peace, even from good." This painful necessity soon proved to
   him a pleasing occasion. While he yielded himself up to the thoughts,
   the reveries and the pensive workings of his own heart, a sacred fire
   of devotion was kindled in his breast.

   And, Brethren, whatever the circumstances of the Psalmist, you will all
   see that the exercise was profitable. And however peculiar the
   advantages of meditation at particular seasons, it may not be amiss for
   us to make it a common habit. Inverting a popular proverb, "What was
   one man's medicine may be food for others," there is much that is light
   and frothy in our ordinary communion. And our communications, one with
   another, soon grow frothy and insipid when we have no definite matter
   in hand. Whether, therefore, to free ourselves from the stress of
   business, or to escape from the temptations of idleness, let it be
   thought worthy of note that "musing" has sweet charms and calm
   reflection is capable of kindling a bright fire.

   Our remarks will now run in two directions. First, we shall say
   something in praise of musing. And then, secondly, we shall supply you
   with some fuel to burn on the altar of your hearts.

   I. First, then, LET US SAY SOMETHING IN PRAISE OF MUSING. We do not
   muse much in these days of ours. We are too busy. We are hurrying here
   and there, doing much and talking much, but thinking very little and
   spending but very little time, indeed, in the modesty of retirement--

   "The calm retreat, the silent shade," are things which we know very
   little about. We would be better men if we were more alone. And I
   suppose that we should do more good, after all, if with even less of
   active effort we spent more time in waiting upon God and gathering
   spiritual strength for labor in His service. Where lives there upon
   earth, in these days, a man who spends hour after hour of the day in
   meditation upon God? There may be such and if there is I wish that I
   had their acquaintance.

   Where will you find giants such as those who lived in the Puritanical
   times, whose lips dropped pearls because they themselves had dived down
   deep in the fathomless ocean of mercy by the sweet aid of meditation?
   There may be such and I wish that it were our lot to sit under their
   ministry. But I fear that the most of us are so little in
   retirement--so seldom in communion with God in private and even when
   there, the communion is for so short a time--that we are but tiny
   dwarfs, and can never, while we live thus, attain to the stature of a
   perfect man in Christ Jesus.

   The world has put a little letter before the word "musing," and these
   are the days, not for musing, but for amusing. People will go anywhere
   for amusement. To muse is a strange thing to them and they think it
   dull and wearisome. Our good sires loved the quiet hour and loved it so
   well that they cherished those times which they could spend in musing
   as the most happy because they were the most peaceful seasons of their
   life. We drag such time off to execution in a moment and only ask men
   to tell us how we may kill it.

   Now there is much virtue in musing, especially if we muse upon the
   best, the highest and the noblest of subjects. If we muse upon the
   things of which we hear and read in sacred Scripture, we shall do
   wisely. It is well to muse upon the things of God because we thus get
   the real nutriment out of them. A man who hears many sermons is not
   necessarily well-instructed in the faith. We may read so many religious
   books that we overload our brains and they may be unable to work under
   the weight of the great mass of paper and of printer's ink. The man who
   reads but one book and that book his Bible, and then muses much upon
   it, will be a better scholar in Christ's school than he who merely
   reads hundreds of books and muses not at all.

   And he, too, who gets but one sermon in a day, though it is an ill
   habit to stay away from half our Sunday engagements and only go out
   once, yet, he who hears but one sermon in a day, if he meditates much
   upon it, will get far more out of it than he who hears two or three but
   meditates not! The Truth of God is something like the cluster of the
   vine--if you would have wine from it, you must bruise it--you must
   press and squeeze it many times. The bruisers' feet must come down
   joyfully upon the bunches or else the juice will not flow. And they
   must leap and leap and leap again, and well tread the grapes, or else
   much of the precious liquid will be wasted.

   You must, by the feet of meditation, tread the clusters of Truth if you
   would get the wine of consolation from them. Our bodies are not
   supported by merely taking food into the mouth--the process which
   really supplies the muscle and the nerve and the sinew and the bone is
   the process of digestion. It is by digestion that the outward food
   becomes assimilated with inner life. And so is it with our souls. They
   are not nourished merely by what we hear by going here and there and
   listening awhile to this and then to that and then to the other.

   Hearing, leading, marking and learning all require inward digesting.
   And the inward digesting of the Truth of God lies in the meditating
   upon it. Ruminating creatures chew the cud and these have always been
   considered clean animals. And so it is a mark of a true child of God
   that he understands how to chew the cud of meditation. Why is it that
   some people are always in a place of worship and yet they are not holy
   though they make some slight advances in the Divine life? It is because
   they neglect their closets. They love the wheat, but they do not grind
   it. They would have the corn, but they will not go forth into the
   fields to gather it.

   The fruit hangs upon the tree, but they will not pluck it. The water
   flows at their feet, but they will not stoop to drink it. They are
   either too idle, or too busy--I will not say which--but often to be
   busy is to be idle. And when some men think us idle, we are then best
   at work. You who know anything of the Divine life know very well what I
   mean by that. Meditation is not idleness and retirement is not
   forsaking the good of the world. I suppose that Moses did as much for
   Israel on the mountain's summit with uplifted hands as ever Joshua did
   in the valley with his drawn sword. And Elijah upon the top of Carmel,
   yes, even by the brook Cherith, or in the house of the widow of
   Zarephath was as much serving Israel as when he smote the priests of
   Baal and hewed them in pieces before the Lord. I commend meditation to
   you, then, for fetching the nutriment out of the Truth of God.

   Another note in the praise of this most blessed, but much-neglected
   duty is that it fixes the Truth upon the memory. You complain of short
   memories--you say that what you have heard you can scarcely remember to
   another day. If your paint is thin and you can not make your picture
   stand out in glowing colors, lay on many coats of your paint and so
   will you do what you want. If your memory will not retain the Truth the
   first time, then think it over and over and over again and so, by
   having these several coats of paint, as it were, the whole matter shall
   abide.

   When the fly fisherman goes out to fish, it may be that in mid-stream
   he sees a great fish and having cast his fly, the hook is soon fairly
   in the fish's jaws. But what now? Why, he must let him run out the line
   and then he must drag him back again! And after all that he never
   thinks his fish safely his own till he gets him into the net. Well,
   now, hearing sermons is, as it were, getting the hook into the fish's
   mouth and meditation is the landing-net--it is this which gets the
   thing to shore!

   And what if I say that after that the same meditation becomes a fire of
   coals upon which the fish is broiled and prepared for our spiritual
   food? If you cannot hold a thing well, try and get many hooks to hold
   it with and meditation will supply you, as it were, with a hundred
   hands--every one of which you may grasp the Truth of God. I am sure,
   dear Friends, that we give not earnest heed enough to these things, or
   else we should not let them slip. There are many photographers who can
   take a street view more rapidly than I can speak of it. They have but
   just to lift up the cover and put it down again and the whole thing is
   done.

   But the same photographer, if he wishes for many things which are to
   endure and last, he likes, if he has time, to have the object long
   before the camera. And there it stands and fairly fixes itself upon the
   plate. And surely, there may be some few men who can just hear a sermon
   and retain the impression of it all their days. There are some who are
   quick of understanding in the things of God and as with a flash they
   get the Truth and never lose it. But the most of us need more than
   this. If we would have the Truth photographed upon our hearts we must
   keep it long before the spiritual lens or else it never will fix itself
   there.

   Complain not, then, of your memory! Complain of yourself if you are not
   given to meditation. If your memory is frail let your closet rebuke you
   because you have not been there more often. Whereas another man may do
   with less meditation, if you say your memory is weak, the more reason
   why you should be a longer time and more often with your God in secret.
   All need this, but you need it more than others. See to it, then, that
   you neglect not this duty. For getting the nourishment out of Truth and
   moreover, for preserving, for salting down the Truth for future use,
   employ much meditation. Meditation clips the wings of thoughts which
   otherwise would fly away at the first clapping of the world's hands.
   You shall thus keep your prey, as it were, surrounded and entangled in
   a net or else it might escape you. Your meditation shall hold it fast
   until you need it.

   Yet further, meditation is of great value in opening up the Truth of
   God and leading us into its secrets. There is some gold to be found on
   the surface of this land of Ophir, the Book of God. There are some
   precious jewels which may be discovered even by the wayfaring man--but
   the mass of the gold is hidden in the heart of the earth. And he who
   would be rich in these treasures must dig into Scripture as one who
   seeks for choice pearls. You must go down into its depths and you must
   rummage there until you get at last at the treasure.

   Truth is sometimes like a flint, which, when it is struck the first
   time yields not, and you may even strike it yet again and still it
   yields not. But at last, one happy blow of the hammer shall make it fly
   to shivers. Meditation may be compared for its potency to the great
   battering ram which Sir Christopher Wren used when he built the present
   St. Paul's Cathedral. Old St. Paul's, you remember, had been destroyed
   by fire, but its walls were so extremely thick that it was found very
   difficult to take the old walls away.

   And they were so lofty that there was also great danger to the workmen.
   Sir Christopher therefore invented a ram composed of a large piece of
   timber and intended to be used in the same way as the Romans used their
   rams of old. A number of men were set to work with this ram and of
   course, being a new instrument to them, they did not like it and they
   did not believe in it, either.

   After hammering away some five or six hours and the wall showing no
   sign, whatever, of anything like an impression, they complained to Sir
   Christopher that he had given them a useless work to do. He set them at
   it again and the ram fell heavily but not a stone seemed to stir. One
   whole day they kept on thus, battering away at the walls. The architect
   knew full well that although it might not be palpable to the laborers,
   there must have been a degree of oscillation given to the whole
   structure. And so it proved, for the next morning when they began the
   work again, all of a sudden down tumbled the whole mass! Thus at length
   the men were convinced that the work of the day before had not been
   lost--it really had been telling when they could not chalk down the
   progress.

   You will find it the same with Gospel doctrine that you want to
   understand but cannot. There is some difficulty you cannot surmount.
   Meditation comes and gives one stroke after another with all the weight
   of prayer and of thoughtful-ness, but it stirs not. But at last our
   diligence is rewarded and we see the whole mass of masonry which reason
   had piled together of fabulous traditions comes tumbling down. The
   foundation is discovered and the Truth of God made clear to our
   apprehension in a moment.

   What? Do you think that the great thoughts of masterminds come in a
   minute? People say, "Oh, what a genius!" Nonsense! The man had been
   hard at work over that for years and years, and years--though perhaps
   the thing came at last to him suddenly. It was not a whit less a result
   of study--the success which crowns the patient brainwork of a
   meditative mind. Never despair, dear Friends, of understanding the
   Truth. If you will, in the name of Jesus, give your souls to the study
   and come resolved to sit at Christ's feet as Mary did--to believe just
   what He tells you, as He tells it to you though He may reveal dark
   things and speak of them to you in parables--you shall be able to
   comprehend with all saints what are the heights and depths, and you
   shall yet know the love of Christ which passes knowledge.

   Be not weary of well-thinking! Use much diligence in musing! Yield up
   your heart to sacred meditation. Turn the matter over and over and over
   again in your minds. You remember the story of the great philosopher
   who had been attempting to discover how much alloy there was in the
   king's crown but who could find no way of doing it. By day and by night
   he pondered it. No, at night when he slept, his daydreams did but come
   to him again! But all of a sudden, when he was in bed, he sprang up and
   wrapped his garments about him and ran through the street, crying out,
   "Inveni, Inveni," I have found it! I have found it!"

   And one of these days, Christian, when you are puzzling over some
   doctrine which you feel must be true but which you cannot grasp, you
   will spring upon your feet when God the Holy Spirit has revealed the
   Truth to you and you will cry, "I have found it! I have found it!" And
   great will be your joy at the discovery! Cultivate much, then, the
   habit of retirement and meditation because of the way in which it opens
   up the Truth of God. Here, almost unwittingly, I have touched upon
   another suggestion. This musing is a charmed exercise, for, mark you,
   the joy which it brings.

   There is a text in Scripture which speaks of the sinner as rolling sin
   under his tongue as a sweet morsel, an allusion to the habit of the
   man, who, when he gets a dainty thing, swallows it not at once but
   rolls it under his tongue, trying to draw out more and more of its
   sweetness. Well, now, this is what the Christian should do with
   doctrinal Truth--he should roll it under his tongue! You will have far
   more enjoyment while it is in your mouth than you will afterwards, so
   keep it there! Meditate much upon it--roll it under your tongue again
   and again and again--until you get more to find its savor.

   Scripture is often like a bone, but meditation is the hammer which
   cracks it and then the soul gets the marrow and the fatness. The
   beauties of Christ are not to be seen by the passerby who merely
   glances at Him. There is something to arrest attention at a glance, it
   is true, but he who would see the beauties of Jesus must look and look
   and look again until his whole soul is enamored of the Savior. And as
   he looks and is transformed into the Savior's image, he shall have such
   enjoyment that this side of Heaven there is none other like it!
   Communion comes after musing. "My meditation of Him shall be sweet,"
   said the Psalmist, and so truly it is.

   When I can walk with Him, as the old philosophers walked with Plato in
   the groves of the Academe, then am I indeed made wise unto salvation!
   And then, too, is my heart made glad. There is no riding in the
   chariots of Amminadib except by being much with Christ. The spouse does
   not say, "I stood under His shadow," no, but, "I sat under His shadow
   with great delight." Sitting down is the posture of waiting in which we
   ungird the loins of the mind and indulge the repose of meditation. Let
   us sit down, then, beneath His shadow and we shall have great delight
   in musing upon Christ.

   But perhaps, after all, the best reason--at least the best to clench
   all the other reasons I have given, why we should spend much time in
   musing--is because musing, then, becomes easier to us. I never did
   light an oven fire in my life, but I have heard that sometimes when a
   baker goes to light a coal oven, if his fuel is a little damp, he gets
   no blaze. But when the fire is once up then he may throw in what he
   will and everything is speedily consumed by the vehement heat. So
   sometimes you and I feel our hearts to be like cold ovens. And we try
   to put some fresh Truth in but it will not burn. But, ah, when the
   heart gets hot and the fire is roaring, then even such damp material as
   I am able to give you on Sundays will burn right well and the feeble
   words of a poor servant of God will make your hearts hot within you!

   We can meditate better after we have addicted ourselves to a meditative
   frame. When we have mused a little, then the fire begins to burn. And
   you will perceive that as the fire burns meditation gets easier and
   then the heart gets warm. And oh, what holy affections, what blessed
   excitements those have who are much alone with Christ! Such a man never
   has a cold heart or a slack hand who is much in meditation with his
   Lord Jesus. His heart comes to be like a mass of molten lard and before
   long he verifies the experience of the Psalmist and can make my text
   his own!

   "Then spoke I with my tongue." He cannot help it, for this lava will
   soon be running over in burning hot words. And if this man should be a
   preacher, he will preach with holy power! His heart being hot, his
   words will burn their way into his hearers' hearts. Nor will it end
   there--this hot heart will soon make a hot hand and the man who once
   has his soul full of Christ will not have his hand empty for Christ.
   Now he will work! Now he will preach for Christ! Now he will pray! Now
   he will plead with sinners! Now he will be in earnest! Now he will
   weep! Now he will agonize! Now he will wrestle with the angel and now
   he will prevail!

   As the fire burns his whole being gets into a glow. And the man, like a
   pillar of fire, warms those who are round about him--burns his way to
   the glory of success and gives his Master fresh renown! Commend me,
   then, for all these reasons which we have given this blessed art of
   holy musing.

   II. And now we have to spend the few minutes which remain in PUTTING
   SOME FUEL ON THE FIRE OF MEDITATION. The man who says that he has
   nothing to think about can surely have no brains. And that professing
   Christian who says he has nothing to muse upon must be a laughingstock
   for devils. A Christian man without a subject for contemplation?
   Impossible! Only give us the time and the opportunity and there are a
   thousand topics which at once present themselves for our consideration.

   Let me just suggest a few of these to the Christian. Your heart will
   surely burn like an oven, my Christian Brothers and Sisters, if you
   think, first, upon eternal love! What a topic to muse upon!--

   "Sing we, then, eternal love,
   Such as did the Father move,
   When He saw the world undone,
   Loved the world and gave His SON."

   Think of that love without beginning and which, blessed be God, shall
   never, never cease! Give the wings of your imagination full play and go
   back to the time before all time--when there was no day but the Ancient
   of Days--when ages had not begun to be, but God dwelt alone!

   Remember, if you are one of His people, the Father loved you even then
   and He continues still to love you and will love you when, like a
   bubble, this earth has melted and like a gypsy's tent the universe has
   been rolled up and put away! Why, as you think of this, surely you will
   say with our songster--

   "Loved of my God, for Him again
   With love intense I'd burn--
   Chosen of God before time began,
   I'd choose Him in return."

   If you want meditation, dear Friends, here is an ocean to swim in! That
   one doctrine of election, that precious Truth of predestinating love
   and all the consequences which flow from it--why, here is a well--an
   overflowing well which you can never drink dry. Take deep draughts of
   it, then, and while you are musing you shall find that your heart is
   warmed.

   Then, next, there is dying love to think of. Oh, think of the Savior
   descending from the starry heights of Glory and coming down to the
   Virgin's womb, and then descending from that lowly manger of Bethlehem
   even to the Cross and to the grave for you! He counted it not robbery
   to be equal with God and yet for your sake He took upon Himself the
   form of a servant and made Himself of no reputation, but became
   obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross!

   Many of the ancient saints were accustomed to spend hours in meditating
   upon the wounds of Christ, and many of the martyrs were for days
   engaged in solemn meditation upon those wounded hands and feet and that
   pierced side. Oh, of all the volumes which were ever written, this
   volume, printed in crimson upon the pure, lily-like flesh of Christ, is
   the best to read! Talk you of pictures? Was there ever such a picture
   as that which God drew with the pencil of eternal love, dipped into the
   color of Almighty wrath on Calvary's summit?

   Angels desired to see it, but there was a veil before the picture until
   Jesus came and drew it up--then the spectacle was revealed--to be gazed
   upon throughout eternity by adoring spirits, with fresh wonder and
   admiration forevermore! You cannot exhaust this subject, but, O, let me
   beseech you to give it the first and chief place in your meditation. "I
   have set the Lord always before me," would be a good motto for the
   Believer and well would it be for him to have the Cross painted upon
   his very eyeballs so that everywhere he should be reminded of Christ
   Crucified and so should be led always to say, "For me to live is
   Christ." That topic never can be exhausted and there are kindred ones
   connected with it--your justification, the work of the Spirit--and so
   on.

   Let me now hint at one or two other matters which I wish you should
   solemnly brood over. You will do well, Christian, to meditate much upon
   death. What? Man, did I see you turn away? A Christian afraid of death?
   No, verily, for death is our Lord's doorkeeper. Life keeps the key and
   says to us, "You shall not enter into your Father's mansions." But
   Death comes and with his bony hand snatches the key out of the grasp of
   the tyrant, Life, and puts it into the lock and opens the gate and lets
   us in! Why, we say sometimes, "the last enemy which shall be destroyed
   is death," but if he is "the last enemy," he is not altogether the less
   a friend, for he is a friend, too, now that Christ has transformed him.

   It is to be greatly wise, Christian, to think sometimes of the grave,
   the mattock, and the shroud. The catacomb is no ill place for musing,
   and a little cemetery, with its green knolls and its white memorial
   stones will be a good place in which to study for the man who wishes to
   muse upon life and immortality in the midst of death. The old
   naturalists, who tell us a good many things which are not true, as well
   as some which are, say that the birds of Norway always fly more swiftly
   than any others because the summer days are so short and therefore they
   have so much to do in such a little time.

   I do not know anything about the birds of Norway, but this I do know,
   that Christ's birds would surely fly more swiftly if they would only
   meditate upon the fact that the day is so short and that the night is
   so near at hand. Surely they would fly more swiftly and work more
   earnestly if they only thought more of the nearness of eternity! And
   then, Christian, if that does not make your heart burn, let me persuade
   you to think of Heaven! O, carry your thoughts from this poor dunghill
   world up to the golden streets and to the music-begetting harps! Up
   yonder, I say, let your souls soar and dwell where your treasure
   is--with Christ upon His Throne.

   Listen how they sing tonight the eternal hallelujah louder than the
   voice of many waters and yet sweet as harpers harping with their harps!
   Listen how the music swells in a sea of Glory round about the Throne of
   the eternal God! And you and I shall soon be there--leaving behind the
   sweat of toil, the rags of poverty, the shame of persecution, the pangs
   of sickness and the groans of death--of the death of sin. We shall soon
   be immortal, celestial, immaculate, glorified with the Glory which
   Christ had with His Father before the world was. Oh, your hearts will
   surely glow if you can muse thus upon Heaven, if you can sing with me
   tonight--

   "My soul amid this stormy world Is like some fluttered dove, And fain
   would be as swift of wing To flee to Him I love. My heart is with Him
   on His Throne, And ill can brook delay, Each moment listening for the
   voice, 'Rise up and come away! I would, my Lord and Savior, know That
   which no measure knows, Would search the mystery of Your love, The
   depth of all Your woes. I fain would strike my harp divine Before the
   Father's Throne, There cast my crown of righteousness, And sing what
   Grace has done. Ah, leave me not in this base world, A stranger still
   to roam, Come, Lord and take me to Yourself, Come, Jesus, quickly
   come!"

   Why is His chariot so long in coming? Why does He tarry? Come quickly,
   come, Lord Jesus, come! Lash the white horse and bid him come as soon
   as may be, that Death may meet me and that I may meet my God!

   And if that stirs you not, Christians, there is one other subject
   necessary for you to muse upon. Sometimes, Christians, think of Hell.
   No, start not, I pray you, for you will never have to feel it and
   therefore you need not shrink from thinking of it. Think of that Hell
   from which you have escaped and it will surely fire you with gratitude.
   Think of that place of doom into which multitudes are going every day
   and if this brings not the tears to your eyes and makes not your heart
   palpitate with zeal, I know not what will!

   Consider that now, while I have been speaking, a soul has passed into
   eternity and oh, since we have been here how many spirits have taken
   the last dreadful plunge into the lake which burns with fire and
   brimstone--lost, lost--lost beyond my call and beyond your prayers! No
   sermons can save them now! No tears can bring them to repentance now!
   They are gone, gone! Yes, and there are others who are going--who walk
   the streets of this great London! What multitudes do we meet who will
   forever have to magnify the awful justice of that God whom they have
   slighted, and of that Savior whom they have rejected!

   And will not this make you bestir yourselves? O my Brethren, if we can
   think of Hell and yet be idle. If we can meditate upon the wrath to
   come and yet be prayerless, then surely feeling has been given to
   beasts and we are turned to stone. What? Believe in judgment and in
   eternal wrath and yet not weep for sinners? Believe in Hell and yet not
   weep for sinners? Surely, we may expect to be turned, like Lot's wife,
   into pillars of salt if we thus show signs of looking back with
   careless and wicked eyes on burning Sodom, instead of fleeing from it
   and urging others to escape from the wrath to come!

   Christians, I have given you topics enough to meditate upon. May I
   fondly hope that some of you will try during the next week to scrape up
   some fragments of time to be alone? I should not have a cold-hearted
   congregation--I should not have need to stir you up to liberality in
   giving, or in earnestness, or in service, if you would but muse
   much--for well am I persuaded that while you are musing the fire will
   burn.

   But I address myself now--stealing a minute of your time which might,
   perhaps, be worse spent than here--though I go beyond the allotted
   hour, I address myself to those who are not yet converted to God. I
   could have hope for you, my dear Hearer, I could have good hope for you
   if I knew that you were given to musing. And if you are so given, may I
   suggest a few topics which are most likely to be useful to you? Muse, I
   pray you, unregenerate man and woman, upon your present state. "Dead in
   trespasses and sins," as you now are, the wrath of God abides on you!
   Heirs of wrath even as others, afar off, without God, without hope and
   without Christ in the world, I pray you remind yourselves of the hole
   of the pit where you now are and out of which you have never yet been
   dug.

   Perhaps I have thought more about your soul than you have ever thought
   about it in your life! I pray you now let your own thoughtfulness begin
   to exercise itself--examine yourself--see what your state is. And when
   you have thought that over, I pray you consider what your end must be
   if you continue what you are. If you are resolved to perish, at least
   look your doom in the face. If you mean to make your bed in Hell, I
   pray you look at it and see the dreadful coverlet of flame in which you
   shall be wrapped forever! If you have made a league with Hell, I pray
   you see where that league will take you!

   Count the cost, I beseech you, for every wise man should do it. Can you
   dwell with the devouring flames? Can you? Can you dwell with
   everlasting burnings? I know you cannot--for while I do but even use
   the word--my bones seem to tremble and rottenness takes hold upon my
   heart. And how will you endure it when God comes forth to tear you in
   pieces and there shall be none to deliver? Oh, what will you do in that
   day of your visitation? What will you do when the sharp and furbished
   sword is drawn from its scabbard--when God comes forth dressed as a man
   of war--to take vengeance upon your iniquities?

   I pray you, then, muse upon these things and perhaps the fire may burn,
   perhaps the heart may melt, perhaps tears of penitence may come
   streaming down from both your eyes in rivers. But if you will not think
   of this, at least let me give you a better and a sweeter topic to muse
   upon. Think of my Lord and Master Jesus Christ--

   "Is it nothing to you, all you that pass by, Is it nothing to you that
   Jesus should die?" I pray you sit down at the foot of His Cross and
   answer these questions. Did He die for you, or not? Remember, my
   Hearers, Christ did not die for everyone. Some of you will have no lot
   and no part in His blood. If you die without faith in Him, that blood
   will never cleanse you--that precious blood is not an Atonement for
   your sins.

   Do not suppose that Christ came into the world to save damned souls.
   No, those whom He came to save He will save and every vessel of mercy
   bought with His blood shall glitter upon the tables of Heaven--not one
   of His precious sheep shall be cast out. The question is--Is that blood
   shed for you? And you may know whether it is or not by this--Are you
   willing to trust Him? If you trust Him, this is the mark of redemption,
   this is the blood mark upon the purchased sheep. Can you, as you sit
   there, think upon this--that He died for sinners, the Just for the
   unjust--that He might bring them to God and that He died for those who
   hated Him?

   I think I see Him now. There on the Cross He hangs and suffers for
   those who cursed Him. He bleeds for those who hounded Him through the
   streets. He bows His head upon His bosom in an extremity of anguish for
   the very men who put the vinegar and the gall into His mouth. "Of whom
   I am chief," says Paul, when he spoke of sinners for whom Jesus died.
   Sinner, you can not have sinned so foully as Paul did and if you rest
   on the blood of Christ you shall be saved! Some men tell me that they
   do not know how to get faith. Faith is the gift of God, but then faith
   usually comes by meditating much upon Christ. "Faith comes by hearing
   and hearing by the Word of God." As it comes in this way, hearing
   begets meditation. And while we are meditating upon the great and
   marvelous story of the condescension and the suffering of Jesus,
   something seems to say within us, "Yes, it is true, I will believe it,"
   and faith is thus worked in us before we are aware of it and we cast
   ourselves upon Jesus Christ.

   And then, Sinner, if this topic will not suit you, let me remind you
   that there shall come a day when you will have to muse without any
   hope. Abraham said to Dives, "Son, remember." Son, remember, you may
   forget today. You have, perhaps, forgotten until now and you will
   forget when you leave this Tabernacle what I have said to you, or what
   God has said--but you will never be able to forget when once you have
   come into Hell-fire. Then it will be, "Son, remember," and you will
   remember your mother's tears and your father's prayers! You will
   remember your privileges. The invitations and the wooings of love which
   you had will all rise up before you anew and you will see how guilty
   you have been.

   "Son, remember," and then all your sins will rise again before you--the
   nights, the days, the words, the thoughts, the deeds--will all start up
   and people Hell with multitudes of worse than Fiends to plague and
   torment you forever. "Son, remember," and then you will remember the
   Christ who was preached to you, the stirrings of conscience which you
   once had and how you sinned against it all and choked the good seed.
   "Son, remember," and then you will be made to remember all that is yet
   to come! You will remember God's threats concerning the wrath which
   never can be appeased, the fire which never shall be quenched, and the
   worm which shall never die. O I pray you, instead of remembering then,
   remember now! O that I could plead with you!

   I stand here so far away from you--would that I could come and take you
   by the hand and say, "Why will you perish? Men and women, why will you
   die?" O you who are strangers to my Lord and Master, do you find any
   pleasure in your sins? Are the ways of the world, after all, so fair
   and so pleasant as you once thought them to be? Is there not an
   emptiness? Do you not find "an aching void" in all your pleasures? Tell
   me now, will you be able to die quietly as you now are? Can you put
   your head down upon your death pillow softly and in peace? Can you
   think of meeting God and hearing the thunders of the last tremendous
   day and beholding the wonders of the resurrection--can you think of
   these things with anything like composure? You cannot! I know you
   cannot!

   O, then--

   "Come, trembling souls and flee away To Christ and heal your wounds!
   This is the glorious Gospel day In which free Grace abounds!"

   May the Spirit of God now sweetly bring you to the Savior. Poor Dove,
   poor Dove, the hawk is after you and you can not fight him, nor can you
   escape him. Hearken to One who loves you! There is a cleft in yonder
   Rock to hide yourself in and then the hawk would lose his prey. Soul,
   the wounds of Jesus are the clefts in the Rock! Flee there and the
   fowler, Satan, shall seek, but shall never be able to reach you, for
   there is salvation in Him who died that we might live. Save us now, for
   His name's sake. Amen.

                                Let Us Go Forth

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JUNE 26, 1864, BY THE REV. C. H. SPURGEON
   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Let us go forth therefore unto Him outside the camp, bearing His
   reproach."

   Hebrews 13:13.

   MODERN professors have discovered a very easy way of religion. There is
   a method by which a man may attain to great reputation as a Christian
   and yet avoid all the trials of the Believer's estate. He may go
   through the world finding his path as smoothly turfed as the flesh
   could desire. Blessed with the smiles of friendly formalists and with
   the admiration of the ungodly, he may pass from his first entrance into
   the Church to his grave without experiencing so much as a single shower
   to dampen his happiness. The sun may smile sweetly upon him all the
   way, the birds may sing--not a raven may dare to croak, not a single
   owl may hoot--his road to glory and immortality shall be all that ease
   could wish!

   Let him adopt the modern theory of universal love. Let him believe that
   a lie is a truth and that whether it is a lie or a truth is of no
   consequence at all. Let him be complacent towards every man, and with a
   smooth and oily tongue chime in with every other man's principles,
   having none of his own worth mentioning. Let him trim his sails
   whenever the wind changes. Let him in all things do in Rome as Rome
   does. Let him yield at all times to the current and float gently with
   the stream and he shall come to the haven--though I fear not the
   desired one--he shall come to some sort of haven at last, without any
   storm or tempest by the way.

   But a daring thought comes across one's mind. Is this the kind of
   religion which we read of in the Bible? Is this the way in which
   Scriptural saints went to Heaven? It would be a very pleasant thing if
   we could please men and please God, too--if we could make the best of
   both worlds and have the sweets of this and of the next also! But a
   warning cry arises from the pages of Holy Scripture, for the Word of
   God talks very differently from this. It talks about a straight and
   narrow way and about few that find it. It speaks of persecution,
   suffering, reproach, contending even unto blood, and striving against
   sin! It talks about wrestling and fighting, struggling and witnessing.
   I hear the Savior say not, "I send you forth as sheep into the midst of
   green pastures," but, "as sheep in the midst of wolves."

   I hear him prophesy that we should be hated of all men for His name's
   sake. Truly these things are enough to startle those good easy souls
   who go so delicately onward! Surely they may at once enquire, "Can it
   be that this smooth-faced godliness--this very delightful way of
   getting to Heaven--is the right one?" Is it not all a delusion? Are we
   not buoyed up with a false hope, if that hope is never assailed by
   trouble and persecution? All is not gold that glitters--may not the
   glittering religion of the many be, after all, only a pretense and a
   sham?

   O you lovers of carnal ease, woe unto you! Inasmuch as you take not up
   the Cross, you shall never win the crown! The disciples of Christ must
   expect to follow their Master not merely in obedience to His doctrines,
   but also in the reproach which gathers about His Cross. I do not find
   Christ carried on flowery beds of ease to His Throne. I do not find Him
   applauded with universal acclamations! On the contrary, wherever He
   goes He is a protestor against things established by human wisdom. And
   in return, the things established vow His destruction and are not
   satisfied until at last they gloat their cruel eyes with His martyrdom
   upon the Cross.

   Jesus Christ has no life of pleasure and of ease! He is despised and
   rejected of men--a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief! And let us
   rest assured that if we bear faithfully our testimony we shall discover
   that the servant is not above his Master, nor the disciple above his
   Lord--if they have called the Master of the house "Beelzebub," much
   more shall they call them of His household by titles as ignominious and
   shameful. We must expect, if the Christian soldier is really a soldier
   and not a mere pretender to the art of war, that he will have to fight
   until he joins the Host triumphant. If the Church is properly imaged by
   a ship, she must expect to have storms. And every man on board her must
   look to bear his share.

   From the first day, when Cain and Abel divided the first family into
   two camps, even until now, the flesh lusts against the Spirit. The evil
   contends with the good and the good wrestles with the evil. Wherever
   the true and the good have pitched their tents, there the enemy have
   gathered to attack them. Righteousness courts no peace or truce with
   sin--our peaceful Savior came not to form an alliance so unhallowed.
   Hear His own words--"Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I
   came not to send peace, but a sword. For I am come to set a man at
   variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the
   daughter-in-law against her mother-in- law. And a man's foes shall be
   they of his own household."

   Turning to Scripture, then, I find nothing about this pretty by-path
   meadow and its quiet, respectable walk to Heaven. I find nothing about
   riding in the gilded chariots of ease or walking in silver slippers.
   But I do find contention and strife, and rebuke and suffering, and
   cross-bearing and if need be, resistance unto blood striving against
   sin! Our text seems to convey that thought to us most powerfully. Let
   us take it up, and may the Holy Spirit lead us to its true meaning. We
   have before us, first of all, the Believer's path. Secondly his Leader.
   Thirdly, his burden. And fourthly, his reason for following that path.

   I. We have, first of all, THE BELIEVER'S PATH. The Believer's path is,
   "Let us go forth outside the camp." The Divine Command is not, "Let us
   stop in the camp and try to reform it--things are not anywhere quite
   perfect--let us, therefore, stop and make matters right." No, the
   Christian's watch cry is, "Let us go forth." Luther caught this note.
   Many there were who said, "The Church of Rome has in it good and true
   men--let us try and reform her. Her cloisters are not without piety,
   her priests are not without sanctified lives--let us try and restore
   her purity." But Luther heard the voice of God, "Come you out from
   among her, lest you be partakers of her plagues," and therefore he led
   the van, taking for his watchword, "Let us go forth outside the camp."

   To this day the Christian's place is not to tarry in the camp of
   worldly conformity, hoping, "Perhaps I may aid the movement for
   reform." It is not the Believer's duty to conform to the world and to
   the world's ways and say, "Perhaps by so doing I may gain a foothold
   and men's hearts may be the more ready to receive the Truth of God."
   No, from the first to the last day of the Church of God, the place of
   witness is not inside, but outside the camp. And the true position of
   the Christian is to go forth outside the camp bearing Christ's
   reproach.

   In this respect Abraham becomes an example to us. The Lord's first word
   to Abraham is that he should leave his father, his kinsfolk and the
   idolatrous house in which he lived and go to a land which God would
   show him. Away he must go--Faith must be his guide--Providence his
   provision and the living God his only keeper! The separate life of
   Abraham, in the midst of the sons of Canaan, is a type of the separated
   walk of the Church of God.

   Again, when Israel had gone down to Egypt they were not commanded to
   stay there and subdue their oppressors by force of arms, or petition
   the legislature that they might obtain gentler usage--no, but with a
   high hand and an outstretched arm, the Lord brought forth His people
   out of Egypt! Egypt was no place for the seed of Israel. And while they
   wandered in the wilderness and afterwards when they settled in
   isolation in the midst of the promised land, God's Word was fulfilled,
   "The people shall dwell alone: they shall not be numbered among the
   nations."

   As if to keep up the type, the Jewish people at this very period,
   though mingled with all the nations of the world, are as distinct as
   men can be. And you cannot pass by a Jew without remarking at once in
   his face that he is distinct and separate from all mankind. This, I
   say, is but a type of the Church of God--the Church of God is to be
   distinct and separate from all other corporations or communities! Her
   laws come from no human legislator! Her officers claim no royal
   appointment! Her endowments are not from the coffers of the State! Her
   subjects are a peculiar people and her spirit is not of this world!

   What is meant then, dear Friends, by this "going forth without the
   camp"? I understand it to mean, first of all, that every Christian is
   to go forth by an open profession of his faith. You that love the Lord
   are to say so. You must come out and avow yourselves on His side. You
   may be Christians and make no profession, but I cannot be sure that you
   are a Believer, nor can any other man. While you make no profession, we
   must, to a great extent, judge you by the non-profession. And since you
   do not acknowledge yourselves to be a part of Christ's Church we are
   compelled to adjudge you as not a part of that Church! We cannot
   suppose you to be better than you profess to be for the most of men are
   not half so good as their professions.

   Usually, as a rule, no man is as good as his religion and certainly no
   man is ever better than his religion. If you do not profess to be on
   Christ's side--with all charity we are forced to accept your own
   confession of having no interest in Jesus. Come out, Christians! Your
   Master commands you and warns you that if you are ashamed of Him in
   this generation, He will be ashamed of you in the day of His Glory! He
   bids you acknowledge Him, for if you confess Him before men He will
   confess you when He comes in the Glory of His holy angels. I pray you,
   then, come out from among them by taking up the name of a Christian!

   Why, what is there to shudder at? Are you a soldier and will you not
   wear your Captain's livery? What? Do you love Christ and blush to admit
   it? You ought to be glad to plead guilty to the blessed impeachment.
   Why do you stand back? Let not fear or shame restrain you. If you are
   Christians there is really nothing discreditable in it. Up! Stand
   shoulder to shoulder with the people of God and say, "I will go with
   you because the Lord is with you." This done, the Christian is to be
   separate from the world as to his company. He must buy and sell and
   trade like other men in the world, but he is not to find his bosom
   friends in it.

   He is not to go out of society and shut himself up in a monastery--he
   is to be in the world, but not of it. And his choice company is not to
   be among the loose, the immoral, the profane! No, not even among the
   merely moral--his choice company is to be the saints of God. He is to
   select for his associates those who shall be his companions in the
   world to come. As birds of a feather flock together, so the birds of
   paradise are gregarious. Like the speckled birds they are peeked at by
   the common flock. As idle boys were wont to mock at foreigners in the
   streets, so do worldlings jeer at Christians. Therefore the Believer
   flies away to his own company when he wants good fellowship. The
   Christian must come out of the world as to his company.

   I know that this rule will break many a fond connection, but be not
   unequally yoked with unbelievers. I know it will snap ties which are
   almost as dear as life, but it must be done. We must not be overruled
   even by our own brother when the things of God and conscience are
   concerned. You must follow Christ, whatever may be the enmity you
   excite-- remembering that unless you love Christ better than husband,
   or father, or mother, yes and your own life also--you cannot be His
   disciple. If these are hard terms, turn your backs and perish in your
   sins! Count the cost. And if you cannot bear such a cost as this, do
   not undertake to be a follower of Christ!

   The follower of Jesus goes without the camp as to his pleasures. He is
   not without his joys nor his recreations. But he does not seek them
   where the wicked find them. The mirth which cheers the worldly makes
   the Christian sad--the carrion which delights the crow would disgust
   the dove. And so those things which are delightful and full of pleasure
   to un-renewed men shock and grieve the hearts of the regenerate. If you
   have no separation from the world as to your pleas-ures--since your
   heart is generally in your pleasures--your heart, therefore, is with
   the wicked and with them shall your doom be when God comes to judge
   mankind!

   Furthermore, the true follower of Christ is divided from the world as
   to his maxims. He does not subscribe to the laws which rule most men in
   their families and their business. Men generally say, "Everyone for
   himself and God for us all." That is not the Christian's maxim. "Look
   not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of
   others," is the Christian's rule. Some men will sail very near the
   wind. They would not absolutely cheat, but still they use very sharp
   practices. They would not lie, but their puffs and recommendations are
   not quite the truth. The Christian scorns all this questionable dealing
   and in all matters keeps to the rule of uprightness.

   If the Believer is true to his Master and goes outside the camp to
   follow Him, his actions are as clear as the noonday. His word is his
   bond and in his trade he would as soon think of becoming absolutely a
   thief as to condescend to the common tricks of trade. From my soul I
   loathe those men, who, under the pretense and profession of religion,
   use the very respectability of their position to gain credit among
   others that they may defraud by obtaining credit which they do not
   deserve! Such persons are the greatest possible disgrace to the
   Christian Church.

   The bankruptcy courts may whitewash them but the devil has blackened
   them beyond all power of bankruptcy to cleanse them. Their black
   deceitfulness shows through! Men may escape censure when standing at
   the easy bar of the commissioner and get a certificate, but they will
   find it very difficult to get a certificate when God comes to judge
   them in the Last Great Day. Our laws in England really seem to me to be
   made on purpose that men may thieve and rob with impunity, so long as
   they do it under color of commerce. Well, if man's law will not touch
   such men, God's Law shall! And the Church should see that she cleanses
   herself as much as possible from them. If we are followers of Christ,
   we must go forth without this camp of discrepancy and thieving! Ours
   must be a downright and honest religion that will not let us swerve a
   hair's breadth from the straight line of integrity and uprightness.

   Once more, and here is a very difficult part of the Christian's
   course--the Christian is to come out not only from the world's
   pleasures and sins and irreligion--but there are times when the true
   followers of Christ must come out from the world's religion as well as
   irreligion. Every nation has a religion. In the days of Abraham the
   little nationalities round him all had their god. In the days of Christ
   there was am established religion in Judea--and I suppose that out of
   its synagogues our Lord Jesus Christ was thrust with fury. There was an
   established religion with its priests and its proud Pharisaic
   professors--but our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ boldly proclaimed His
   protest against its distortions of Scripture, its want of true
   spirituality, its worldliness, its pomp and pride.

   In His day Jesus Christ was as true a Dissenter as any of us and
   separated Himself and His little company from the authorized and
   established ecclesiastical camp. Judaism was not the religion of
   Abraham, neither were the Pharisees the true exponents and successors
   of Moses. Therefore Christ, with burning words, though full of charity
   and with a loving heart--but with a thundering tongue--bore an awful
   witness against the religion of His own age! He knew how the multitude
   respected it and how the great ones lived upon it, but for all this,
   though His life must be shed for His protest, Christ led His disciples
   away from the national religion to something better, nobler and more
   sublime. And you and I, too, Brethren, must see that we never fall in
   with the religion of the times because it happens to be fashionable and
   because the multitude follow it, or the law of the land patronizes it!

   If there exists anywhere on earth a Church which teaches for doctrine
   the commandments of men, come out of her and bear your witness for the
   Truth of God. I see before me now a Church which tolerates evangelical
   truth in her communion, but at the same time lovingly embraces Puseyism
   and finds room for infidels and for men who deny the authenticity of
   Scripture. This is no time for us to talk about friendship with so
   corrupt a corporation. The godly in her midst are deceived if they
   think to mold her to a more gracious form. Her bishops will not touch
   the Burial Service, although four thousand clergymen petition for a
   little ease for their consciences.

   Nor will they give up reading in God's own worship the filthy story of
   "Susannah and the Elders," nor the nursery tale of "Bell and the
   Dragon"--though one of their priests asserts that he would quite as
   soon read "Jack and the Beanstalk." We have waited long enough--her
   space for repentance has been already too long! Flee out of her, all of
   you who love your souls! Come out from among her! Be you
   separate--touch not the unclean thing lest you be partakers of her
   plagues, for her plagues are many. Often have I read works in which the
   Puseyites call the Church of Rome their sister Church! Well, if it is
   so let the two harlots make a league together, but let good and honest
   men come out of both apostate churches! And those who love the Lord
   Jesus, whether clergy or laity, must leave them to their doom.

   I know it is hard work. It calls upon many to be poor and give up their
   livings, but they must do it. Scotland witnessed, a few years ago, one
   of the noblest spectacles the world ever beheld. My heart would break
   with joy for England if I should live to see such a day and such a deed
   of heroism--but there is not spirit enough left in us. There is not
   Divine Grace enough left in us. I fear we have fallen upon a degenerate
   age.

   The "land of brown heath and shaggy wood, land of the mountain and the
   flood," has nurtured a noble race of brave, bold men and these could
   give up house and home and living for the Truth and for God's sake. But
   it is not so in England. No, they will sell their consciences. They
   will cower down and mutter a lie at the command of the State. They will
   bury adulterers and seducers in sure and certain hope of a blessed
   resurrection. They will teach a catechism which their conscience tells
   them is not true, for riches, for station! For the sake of the loaves
   and fishes, the men of God (and many of them we hope are such) will
   hold still to the false Church. Our protest is lifted up against her
   and our foot stands altogether without her camp. Come you out from
   among her! Be you separate! Touch her not! Have no communion with her
   false doctrines!

   As for each of us who knows the Truth, our place is with Christ outside
   the camp, bearing His reproach. I am sure my text contains all this and
   more. And I would to God that His Church would take up her true
   position now and be separate in all things from anything that defiles
   and makes a lie.

   II. But now, secondly, we have in the text, THE CHRISTIAN'S LEADER. It
   does not say, "Let us go forth outside the camp" merely, but, "Let us
   go forth therefore unto Him." Here is the heart of the text--"unto
   Him." Beloved, we might leave society--we might forsake all its
   conventionalities and become Nonconformists in the widest sense and yet
   not carry out the text--for the text is, "Let us go forth unto Him." O
   Beloved, it is this point that I would urge upon you! I am no
   politician! I care not one whit what Church has the State-pay, or what
   has not. I care not for political dissent--but I do care for
   religiously following my Master's Word and, by His Grace, I will.

   And when I read this text, "Let us go forth therefore unto Him," I set
   myself to learn what the Word means. It means, first, let us have
   fellowship with Him. He was despised. He had no credit for charity. He
   was mocked in the streets. He was hissed at. He was hounded from among
   society. If I take a smooth part, I can have no fellowship with
   Him--fellowship requires a like experience. Come, then, my Soul, put on
   the Savior's garb--walk through the mire with Him! Off with your silver
   slippers--go barefoot within Christ! Be you, yourself, like the bush
   which burns but is not consumed. Be content that your shoulders should
   be raw with His rough Cross--He carried it--do not shirk the labor!
   Expect not to wear the crown where Christ carried the Cross, but, for
   fellowship's sake, follow Him.

   Again, if I am to follow Him, I am to follow His example. What Christ
   did I am to do. I am to go forth unto Him. It is never to be a rule
   unto me that Mr. So-and-So did such-and-such a thing, or Mrs.
   So-and-So--what Christ did is to be my rule. Some men are for hanging
   on what Luther did, or what Calvin did--that is nothing to the
   Christian--he says, "I am to go forth unto Jesus." Follow Jesus Christ
   and none but Jesus Christ and then you will be separate, indeed, from
   the rest of men. I am to go forth unto Him--that is, I am to go forth
   to His Truth. Wherever I see His Truth, I am to espouse it--wherever I
   see error I am to denounce it without hesitation.

   I am to take His Word to be my only standard. And just where His Word
   leads me, there I am to go, no matter where. I may have been educated
   in one way but I am to bend my education to this Book. I may have
   conceived prejudices but they must give way before His Truth. I may
   know that such-and-such a belief is profitable to me but my profit
   shall go for nothing in comparison with the Word of God. And then I can
   to go forth to Christ's witness-bearing. The present age does not
   believe in witness-bearing but the whole Bible is full of it. The duty
   of every Christian is to bear witness for the Truth of God. Christ
   says, "For this purpose was I born and came into the world." He who
   knows the Truth but lays the finger of silence on his lips, saying,
   "Peace, peace, when there is no peace," is a sorry Christian!

   If you have been washed in Jesus' blood and saved by His righteousness,
   I do implore you, take your position with Christ as witness-bearers for
   the Truth as it is in Jesus. My Master wants today a band of men and
   women who are prepared to be singular, so long as to be singular is to
   be right. He wants men and women of bold, unflinching, lion-like hearts
   who love Christ first and His Truth next--and Christ and His Truth
   beyond all the world! Men and women, too, whose holy lives and
   consistent conversation are not to be perverted by the bribes of this
   world and whose testimony is neither to be distorted nor silenced by
   frowns or by smiles.

   Happy souls shall they be who dare to take their stand with Christ
   today! The struggles of the Covenanters of old need to be renewed at
   this moment. The strife of the Puritan age needs to return once more to
   the Church. And what if the stakes of Smithfield come again? And what
   if the times of persecution return to us? The good old vessel which
   outrode the blood-red storm, will outride it still and with all her
   passengers and crew safe on board, be received by the King and honored
   with His gracious smile!

   We are to take care, however, that it is to Christ we go! Not to party,
   not to denomination--not to anything but Christ and His Truth! Out with
   denominationalism or anything else which savors not of Christ Jesus!
   Whether it is the Baptist Church, or the Episcopalian, or the
   Presbyterian Church which errs from Christ's way, it is nothing to any
   one of us which it may be. It is CHRIST we are to care for and Christ's
   Truth. And this we are to follow over all the hedges and ditches of
   men's making--straight away to Christ, clinging to Christ's mantle,
   fighting a way straight through where He Himself fought and opened the
   path to His Crown. Thus have we spoken of the Christian's Leader.

   III. Now, in the third place, we have THE CHRISTIAN'S BURDEN. He is to
   bear the Lord's reproach. The reproach of Christ, in these days, takes
   this shape. "Oh," they say, "the man is too precise." "He is right. But
   still, Truth is not always to be spoken. The thing is wrong, no doubt,
   which he denounces, but still, the time has not come yet--we must be
   lenient towards these things. The man is right in what he says, but we
   must not be too precise nowadays. We must give and take a little--there
   must be charity." God's Word, in this age, is a small affair. Some do
   not even believe it to be Inspired. And those who profess to revere it
   set up other books in a sort of rivalry with it.

   Why, there are great Church dignitaries nowadays who write against the
   Bible and yet find bishops to defend them! "Do not, for a moment, think
   of condemning their books or them. They are our dear Brethren and must
   not be fettered in thought." How many days ago is it since a bishop
   talked in this way in convocation? Some believe in Popery. But here,
   again, the plea will be, "They are our dear Brethren." Some believe in
   nothing at all--but they are still all safely housed in one Church,
   like the beasts, clean and unclean, in Noah's ark.

   Those who come out with Christ, get this reproach--they are too
   precise--in fact, they are "bigots." That is how the world brings it
   out at last--"bigots"--a set of "bigots!" I have heard say that the
   word, "bigot," took its rise from this--that a certain Protestant
   nobleman being commanded, in order to gain his lands, to kneel down and
   in some way or other commit the act of idolatry towards the host, said,
   when he came at last to the point, "By God, I will not!" And they
   called him henceforth a "By-God." If this is the meaning of the word
   "bigot," we cheerfully adopt the title! And were it right to swear, we
   would declare, "By Him that lives! By Heaven! We cannot speak a lie and
   we cannot bend our knee to the shrine of Baal, bigots or no bigots."
   The Truth of God is first and our reputation next.

   Then they say, "Ah, these people are behind their time. The world has
   made such advances. We are in the nineteenth century--you ought to know
   better! The discoveries of science put your narrow views out of court."
   Very well, Christian, be content to be behind the times for the times
   are getting nearer to judgment and the last plagues. "Ah, but," they
   say, "these people seem to us to be so self-righteous. They think
   themselves right and nobody else." Very well, Christian, if you are
   right, think yourself right! And if everybody else should call you
   self-righteous, that does not mistake you so. The Lord knows how we
   cling to the Cross and as poor sinners, look up to Christ and Jesus
   Christ alone. Our conscience is void of offense in this matter.

   "Ah," they say, "they are not worth noticing. They are all a pack of
   fools." It is very remarkable that in the judgment of their own age
   good men always have been fools. Fools have been they who have turned
   the world upside down. Luther and Calvin, Wesley and Whitfield were all
   fools. But somehow or other God managed, by these fools, to get to
   Himself a glorious victory. And then they turn round and say, "It is
   only the poor--only the lower orders. Have they any of the nobility and
   gentry with then?" Well, this reproach we can pretty well bear because
   it is the old standard of Christ that the poor have the Gospel preached
   unto them. And it has ever been a sweet reflection that many who have
   been poor in this world have been made rich in faith!

   Brethren, you must expect, if you follow Christ, to endure reproach of
   some sort or another. Let me just remind you what reproach your Master
   had to bear. The world's Church said of Christ, "He is a deceiver! He
   deceives the people." Incarnate Truth of God and yet a deceiver! Then
   they said, "He stirs up the people! He promotes rebellion. He is no
   friend of good order. He incites anarchy! He is a mere demagogue." That
   was the world's cry against Christ and, as that was not enough, they
   went further and said, "He is a blasphemer!" They put Him to death on
   the charge that He was a blasphemer! They whispered to one another,
   "Did you hear? He said such-and-such last Sunday in His sermon. What a
   shocking thing he did in such a place! He is a blasphemer!"

   Then came the climax. They all said He had a devil and was mad. Surely
   they could go no further than this! But they supplemented it by saying
   when He cast out devils that He did it through Beelzebub, the prince of
   the devils! A sorry life your Master had, you see. All the filth in
   earth's kennels was thrown at Him by sacrilegious hands. No epithet was
   thought coarse enough! No terms hard enough--He was the song of the
   drunkard and they that sat in the gate spoke against Him. This was the
   reproach of Christ. And we are not to marvel if we bear as much.
   "Well," says one, "I will not be a Christian if I am to bear that."
   Skulk back, then, you Coward, to your own damnation! But oh, men and
   women that love God and who seek after the eternal reward, I pray you
   do not shrink from this Cross! You must bear it!

   I know you may live without it if you will fawn and cringe and keep
   back part of the price. But do not do this--it is unworthy of your
   manhood--much more is it unworthy of your Christianity! God and for
   Christ are so holy and so truthful that you compel the world to give
   its best acknowledgment of your goodness by railing at you--it can do
   no more, it will do no less. Be content to take this shame for there is
   no Heaven for you if you will not--no crown without the Cross--no
   jewels without the mire. You must stand in the pillory if you would sit
   in Glory! You must be spit upon and be treated with shame if you would
   receive eternal honor! And if you reject the one you reject the other.

   IV. We close by noticing THE CHRISTIAN'S REASON FOR BEARING HIS
   REPROACH AND GOING WITHOUT THE CAMP. It is in the text, "Let us go
   forth therefore"--there is the reason. Why then? First, because Jesus
   did. Jesus Christ came into the world pure and holy. His life and His
   testimony were a witness against sin. Jesus Christ would not conform.
   If He would but have done so He might have been King of the Jews. But
   no, the most loving spirit that ever lived was also the most firm.
   Nobody shall say that Christ was either self-willed or harsh, or that
   He hated other men-- nothing of the kind! Never was there such pure
   generosity, such overflowing affection for men as you find in Christ.

   But yield the truth, yield holiness? No, never! Not a grain of it! Be
   silent? No, He rebukes the Pharisees. And when the lawyer pulls His
   coat and says, "Master, in so doing, you rebuke us," then Jesus Christ
   begins, "Woe unto you lawyers!" All classes have their portion from His
   mouth. The Herodians come to Him. Does He for a moment yield to them?
   Or when the opposite party tempts does He side with them? Does He side
   with either the Sadducee or with the Pharisee? No, Christ's course was
   ever an independent one--He committed himself unto no man--for He knew
   what was in man. The whole of His life through you cannot mistake Him
   for a Pharisee, or a Sadducee, or any one of the other teachers. He
   stands out like a lone mount of light, separate and apart from the
   chain of dark mountains. And so must the Christian. Christ was
   separate. And so must you be! Christ was pure, holy, truthful. So must
   you be! I pray you either renounce your profession or else seek Grace
   to carry it out.

   Moreover, the connection of the text tells us that Christ set apart His
   people by going outside the camp, that He might sanctify His people. He
   suffered outside the camp. Christ's separation was in order that His
   People might be separated. The Head is not of the world and shall the
   members be of it? The Head is despised and rejected--shall the members
   be honored? "If any man loves the world, the love of the Father is not
   in him." The world rejects Christ--shall the world receive us? No, if
   we are truly one with Him, we must expect to be rejected, too. Christ's
   separation is the type and symbol of the separateness of all the elect.

   Again, Christ would have His people separate for their own
   sanctification. You cannot grow in Grace to any high degree while you
   are conformed to the world. The path of separation may be a path of
   sorrow, but it is the path of safety. And though it may cost you many
   pangs and make your life like a long martyrdom and every day a battle,
   yet it is a happy life after all. There is no such life as that which
   the soldier of Christ leads--for though men frown upon him-- Christ so
   sweetly smiles upon him that he cares for no man! Christ reveals
   Himself as a sweet refreshment to the warrior after the battle and so
   blessed is the vision that the warrior feels more calm and peace in the
   day of strife than in his hours of rest.

   Believe me, the highway of holiness is the highway of communion! A blot
   on your conscience will certainly separate Christ from you as to
   communion. Be pure, be clear, be chaste as before the Lord and you may
   walk as on the mountaintops--having Christ for your Companion--enjoying
   with Him a Heaven on earth! The Covenanters and martyrs tell us in
   their diaries that they were never so happy as when they were in the
   dungeon alone with Christ for company! Their best days were often their
   days of burning--they called them their wedding days and went to Heaven
   singing and chanting the triumphal Psalm as they mounted in their
   chariots of fire!

   Let us close with this last thought and reason. Thus we shall hope to
   win the crown if we are enabled, by Divine Grace, faithfully to follow
   Christ in all respects. Oh, the crown! The crown! The crown! Come, let
   me hold it up to you! Is not this a treasure? Eternal life! Likeness to
   Christ! Sitting at His right hand! Do you not hear them--the harps of
   angels--the songs of the redeemed? Do you not hear them, I say, as in
   one perpetual Psalm of joyfulness they salute the Lord their God with
   thanksgiving?

   It is but a flea-bite here--and then an eternity of bliss! A moment's
   shame and then an eternal honor! A little while of witness-bearing, a
   little while of suffering, a little while to be rebuked and then
   "forever with the Lord"! This reward is so great that it transcends the
   light affliction which is but for a moment. I will not put so little
   shame in contrast with it all. Why, in this age we suffer nothing--a
   few hard words, a jeer, a sneer--now and then a friend who leaves us
   because we speak the Truth. But what is that? O Brethren, we are denied
   the honor of those favored saints who died for Jesus! Our weak spirits
   love these softer times! The real days of honor were the days of
   persecution. The times when saints won brightest crowns were when they
   suffered most.

   I fear the Church of Christ is growing sleepy. Men of God have lost
   muscle and nerve. Our fathers died for half a Truth and we will not
   bear rebuke for a whole one. Two women were tied to the stake at Wigton
   and drowned in the rising tide--do you know what for? Simply because
   they would not say, "God save the king." You say, "What does that
   matter?" Well, it was comparatively a theological trifle. They held a
   certain theory concerning the bearing of the Headship of Christ upon
   the political position of the king. Because they thought the thing was
   wrong--though I, for my part, would say, "God save the king" a thousand
   times--yet they would not say it once and died in constancy to their
   belief.

   The two women were actually tied to stakes by the seaside. The tide
   came up and when the elder woman of the two was drowned they asked the
   younger whether she would say it now. But no, she would not. She
   believed it to be a Truth concerning Christ and His kingdom. And though
   it only touched one of the smallest jewels of His crown, yet she would
   not do it and therefore the gurgling waters came up to her chin and at
   last rolled over one who had faithfully borne witness to a portion of
   Truth which seems very trifling to us nowadays, but which to her seemed
   to be worth dying for!

   Nowadays, I say, we would not die for the whole Bible though in other
   ages saints would have died for the dot of an i, or the cross of a t.
   We turn tail and are frightened because somebody has said a hard thing
   to us for defending the Truth which concerns Jesus and has the
   salvation of man wrapped in it. I say we will not fight for the great
   and they would fight for the little. O may God restore to us, dear
   Friends, more Grace, more piety, more love for souls, more care for the
   kingdom of Christ--a sterner prizing of the Truth of God and a
   determination solemnly avowed before the Lord of hosts, that come what
   may, we will contend earnestly for the faith once delivered unto the
   saints!

   We stand upon the Rock of Ages confident that God will defend the right
   and that right in the end shall come off victorious! God give you
   Grace--especially you members of my charge--to, from this day, more
   than ever you have done, take your place outside the camp and
   cheerfully and joyfully to bear Christ's reproach! Some of you cannot
   do this. You cannot bear His reproach. You cannot go outside the camp
   for you have no vital faith--you have not believed in Jesus. O Sinner,
   you are not to carry Christ's Cross first--but look to that Cross for
   salvation! And when He has saved you, as He will if you trust in Him,
   then take up your cross and carry it and praise the name of God from
   this time forth, even forever!

                        A Bad Excuse Is Worse Than None

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JULY 3, 1864, BY THE REV. C. H. SPURGEON,
   AT BAYSWATER.

   "And they all with one consent began to make excuses." Luke 14:18.

   THE provisions of the Gospel of Christ may well be compared to a
   supper, provided as they were, in the evening of the world--"in these
   last days." The description, "a great supper," is well borne out if we
   consider the greatness of the provision--how much love and mercy God
   has displayed towards the sons of men in the Person of Christ
   Jesus--how much power and gracious working He has shown by His Holy
   Spirit. A great supper it is if we think of the richness and sweetness
   of the provision--it is a feast worthy of the great King. The flesh of
   Jesus is our spiritual meat and His blood our choicest wine. Our souls
   are satisfied with Covenant mercies, most fitly set forth as "A feast
   of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of
   marrow, of wines on the lees well refined."

   A great supper it is, moreover, when we consider the number of guests
   invited. "Go you into all the world and preach the Gospel to every
   creature." The call of the Gospel comes to every man and woman within
   hearing of the ministers of God--

   "None are excluded there, but those Who do themselves exclude! Welcome
   the learned and polite, The ignorant and rude."

   No other king ever sent out an invitation so broad as this! Wisdom
   "cries at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the
   doors. Unto you, O men, I call. And my voice is to the sons of man." Is
   it not strange that when the householder made so great a supper--when
   he offered it without money and without price--that all his neighbors
   should with one consent begin to make excuse?

   He did not call them to prison or to misery! How, then, came they to be
   so unwilling to obey the summons? Why this unanimity in the rejection?
   We find good men differing as to how it is that evil men can hold
   together so well. What? Not one who has respect enough to his generous
   friend to sit at his table and receive his bounty? Not one. Truly,
   here, Brethren, we have a picture of the universal depravity of man!
   All men are thus vile and refuse the mercy of God. We never know how
   bad man is till the Gospel is preached to him. The Gospel acts as a
   white background to set forth the blackness of man's heart.

   Here human nature reaches to the greatest height of sin's enormity!
   Spitting forth his venom against the Lord of Infinite Love, man proves
   himself truly to be of the serpent's brood. The Gospel is preached to
   thousands and do all make excuse? So the parable has it and truly so
   the fact proves it. What? Is there not one whose free will is inclined
   towards Christ? Is there not one of so good a natural disposition that
   he will come to Jesus? No, the text says, not one--"They all with one
   consent began to make excuses." How thoroughly has father Adam ruined
   our understandings! What fools, as well as rebels, we are to refuse to
   partake of the banquet of love! We are altogether become unprofitable.
   There is not one who seeks after God!

   You will, perhaps, remind me that there were other men besides those
   who made excuses. Most true. But these were in the highways and hedges,
   or in the streets and lanes of the city. And so those who do not hear
   the Gospel and therefore are not guilty of rejecting it, yet
   nevertheless are far off from God by wicked works and strangers to the
   commonwealth of Israel. Thus, taking the two characters to represent
   all mankind, we find all to be enemies of God. Those in the highways
   need to be "compelled" to come in--they had a natural reluctance to
   feast at the good man's table. And so all sorts of men are averse to
   the Gospel. They are perfectly willing to sin--content even to perish
   in sin! But to come to Christ, to accept the great Atonement, to put
   their trust in Jesus--this is a thing they care not for and with one
   consent, when they hear the Gospel--they begin to make excuses.

   We fear that there are many in this meeting house this morning who have
   been blessed with hearing the Gospel for years but up to now the only
   treatment they have given to the gracious message is to make excuses
   about it. I hope to deal with such very simply and very
   affectionately--earnestly desiring that they make their last excuse
   this morning and that it may meet with its death blow. O that they may
   come to the feast which they have long rejected and rejoice in the
   mercy of God in Christ Jesus!

   Why did they make excuses? Let us, first, try to account for their
   conduct. Secondly, what excuses did they make?-- let us recount them.
   And thirdly, how foolish thus to make excuses!--here let us encounter
   them.

   I. Let us try to ACCOUNT for the fact, the sad fact, that men are so
   ready to make excuses rather than to receive the Word of God. We
   account for it in the first place by the fact that they had no heart at
   all to accept the feast. Had they spoken the truth plainly, they would
   have said, "We do not wish to come, nor do we intend to do so." If
   man's heart were not so deceitful, it would not make excuses, but it
   would say outright, "'We will not have this Man to reign over us. We do
   not feel our sinfulness. We will not, therefore, accept pardon. We
   believe that we can work out our own salvation with our own doings.

   "Or, if not, we are content to take our chance. If it shall go ill with
   us, it will go ill with a great many people. We will run all risks--we
   do not need salvation--we choose rather to have our full swing of
   carnal delights. Your religion involves too much self-sacrifice. It is
   altogether contrary to the lusting of our minds and therefore we
   decline it." This is at the bottom of it. Some of you, my Hearers, have
   often been impressed and partially convinced of sin but you have put
   off Christ with excuses. Will you bear with me while I solemnly assure
   you that at its core your heart is at enmity to God? Your excuse may
   look very pretty but it is as flimsy as it is fair. If you were honest
   with your own soul you would say at once, "I do not love Christ. I do
   not need His salvation."

   Your put offs, your false promises, your excuses are worthless. Anyone
   with half an eye can see through them, they are so transparent. You are
   an enemy of God! You are unreconciled and you are content to be so.
   This truth may be unpalatable but it is nevertheless most certain. May
   God help you to feel this and may it humble you before His Presence.
   Still, if they would not come to the good man's feast, why did they not
   say so? If the real secret of it was that they hated him and despised
   his provisions, is it not melancholy that they were not honest enough
   to give him a "no" at once? Well, they certainly were not and one
   reason might be because they wished to be upon good terms with their
   conscience. They felt they ought to go. He was one who had a claim upon
   their courtesy, if not their gratitude, and therefore feeling that they
   ought to go and yet not intending to go, they sought to compromise by
   an excuse.

   Conscience is a very unamiable neighbor to men who live in sin. It is
   said of David, "David's heart struck him," and it is a very hard blow
   which the heart is able to give. In order to parry the blow men hold up
   a shield of excuses. You cannot quite extinguish your conscience, which
   is the candle of the Lord and therefore you put it under the bushel of
   an excuse. The thief fears the watchdog and therefore throws him a bone
   to keep him quiet--that bone is made of excuses. John Bunyan tells us
   that Mr. Recorder Conscience, when the town of Mansoul was in the
   keeping of Diabolus, used sometimes to cry out at such a rate that he
   made all the inhabitants afraid and so they put him in a very dark
   place and tried to put a gag in his mouth to keep him quiet. But for
   all that, sometimes when his fits came on he made the town feel very
   uneasy.

   I know what conscience tells some of you--it says to you, "How is it
   you can forget Divine things? How can you trifle with the world to
   come? How can you live as if you never meant to die? What will you do
   when you come to die without an interest in the Lord Jesus Christ?" And
   so that conscience may be quiet awhile, you make an excuse and
   persevere in refusing to come to the feast. It may be that you make
   this excuse to satisfy custom. It is not the custom of this present age
   to fly immediately in the face of Christ. There are not many men of
   your acquaintance or mine who ostensibly oppose religion.

   Your father fears God. Your mother is a woman of great devotion. Your
   friends go to the House of God and speak experimentally of Divine
   things--you do not like, therefore, to say to them, "I will never be a
   Christian! I dislike the ways of God! I do not choose the plan of
   Sovereign Grace," and therefore to spare their feelings you make an
   excuse. You do not want to grieve dear friends--you are afraid if you
   spoke out honestly what your soul feels it might bring your mother with
   gray hairs to the grave, or make your father's heart break--and so you
   make an excuse. And you think that they may entertain a comfortable
   hope whereas, while you make excuses, there is no hope for you at all.

   For my part I would rather you speak outright and say what you mean! I
   would that you would say, "I am an enemy of Christ. I do not believe
   His Gospel. I will not serve Him!" This might sound very badly but it
   would show, at least, that there was some sincerity in you and we would
   hope that before long you might be bowed to the will of Christ. Excuses
   are curses and when you have no excuses left there will be hope for
   you!

   It may be you make these excuses because you have had convictions which
   so haunt you at times that you dare not oppose Christ to His face. You
   have gone home from the services to weep. That little chamber of yours
   is a witness that you cannot live altogether without prayer. The other
   day when you went to a funeral you came home with your mind very solemn
   and you thought, then, that certainly you would yield to the commands
   of Jesus. When you were sick and had that week or two upstairs
   alone--then you vowed and resolved--but your resolves melted into thin
   air.

   The tear starts in your eyes--you are almost persuaded to be a
   Christian--you breathe a prayer! But ah, some ill companion tempts you
   the next morning and there your are, according to the old proverb, "The
   dog has returned to his vomit and the sow that was washed to her
   wallowing in the mire." Ah, how many times did I have convictions of
   sin and terrible ones, too, and yet I said, like Felix to Paul, "Go
   your way for this time. When I have a convenient season, I will call
   for you"?

   But I could not quench these convictions by downright opposition to
   Christ. I knew too much and felt too much to do that, and so I tried to
   patch up a truce between my soul and my convictions. Satan is always
   ready to help men with excuses. This is a trade of which there is no
   end. It certainly commenced very early, for after our first parents had
   sinned one of the first occupations upon which they entered was to make
   themselves aprons of fig leaves to hide their nakedness! Read the
   Scriptures through and you will find that excuse-making has been a
   habit in all ages and among all classes of people.

   And till the last sinner shall be saved by Sovereign Grace, I suppose
   men will still be setting up their vain excuses in the temple of God!
   If you will fire the gun, Satan will always keep you supplied with
   ammunition. When he thinks that a Truth is about to come home to you,
   if you cannot frame an excuse he will do it for you. He will run
   between you and the cannon shot of God's Word to prevent your being
   wounded by it. If the preacher's sword should be too sharp for you and
   make your conscience bleed, the Evil One has a Satanic plaster with
   which he very soon binds up the wound! The natural self-righteousness
   of man prompts him to frame apologies. We are all the best men in the
   world according to our own gauge and measure. If we could sit as judges
   upon ourselves, the verdict would always be "Not guilty."

   Sin, which would be very shocking in another, is very venial in us. No,
   what would be abominable in other men becomes almost commendable in
   ourselves so partially do we judge our own case. The sinner cannot
   think it quite right for himself to be an unbeliever in Christ--and
   since his enlightened conscience will not let him say that he is quite
   safe while he refuses to fly to the wounds of Jesus--he runs to excuses
   in order that he may still say, "I am rich and increased in goods," and
   not be driven to the unhappy necessity of crying, "I am naked and poor
   and miserable."

   Sinful self is hard to conquer, but righteous self is the worst enemy
   of the two. When we can make men plead guilty, then God pronounces
   absolution upon them. But while men will interpose their extenuations
   there is little or no hope for them. O great God our Master, tear away
   the excuses from every sinner here and make him stand guilty before
   Your bar in his own consciousness, that he may cry, "God be merciful to
   me, a sinner," and find pardon through the blood of Jesus Christ! Take
   heed, O you ungodly ones, lest you go on excusing and excusing and
   excusing, until you excuse yourselves down to the pit of Hell! Know
   this--you will never be able to excuse yourselves out again.

   II. We come to RECOUNT these excuses. Many will not come to the great
   supper--will not Christians be on the same ground as those in the
   parable? They are too busy. They have a large family and it takes all
   their time to earn bread and cheese for those little mouths. They have
   a very large business--many servants in their employ--and from the
   first thing in the morning to the last thing at night, if they do not
   see after business, their affairs would go wrong. Or else, if they have
   no business, yet they have so many pleasures and these require so much
   time--their butterfly visits during the morning take up so many
   hours--the dropping of their small pieces of pasteboard at other
   people's doors occupy all their leisure and they really have no
   opportunity to think about matters so unpalatable as death and
   eternity.

   This excuse scarcely needs a word from me to answer it because every
   man knows that it is grossly false. Nobody goes starving because he has
   not time to eat. Now, if God has given time for us to support our
   natural frame, much more has He given us time to feed the soul. I do
   not find my friends in the street half dressed. But I find some of them
   spend many a half-hour over that other pin and that other ribbon. Now
   surely if they have time to dress the body, they must have had time
   given them in which to put on the robe of righteousness and array the
   soul!

   If you have not the time, God gave it to you and you must have misspent
   it. God gives you time as a steward and if you say to your Master, "I
   have it not," He will reply to you, "I entrusted it to you. You must
   have spent it on yourself. You have robbed God." A little earlier
   rising, a little less time at the table--either of these might give you
   time enough. You know you have the time and when you say you have it
   not, the lie is too thin--you can see through it. O Soul! O Soul! When
   holy men can find hours for prayer--when such a man as Martin Luther,
   when he was very busy, used to say--"I must have three hours prayer
   today at least, or else I cannot get through my business"--do not tell
   me that you have not time to seek the Lord!

   Besides, it is not an affair of time. Salvation may be worked in an
   instant! There is life in a look at the Crucified One. There is life at
   this moment for you. And between now and the time when this service
   shall have gone, there is time enough for you to have laid hold upon
   eternal life and to have received Christ Jesus to your soul's
   salvation. That excuse will not do. But then they fly to another. They
   are too good. When I have preached Free Grace and a full Christ, I have
   heard some say, "That is a good sermon for the crowd in a theater--for
   ignorant, low-lived people. But we respectable people do not require
   such salvation. To offer a free salvation to men who are neither
   drunkards nor swearers--why the thing is ridiculous! The sermon was
   very good for Magdalenes, for thieves and such like--but not for us."

   No, you are too good to be saved! You need not a physician because you
   are whole. Your own table has enough upon it. You do not need to come
   to this feast. But think, I pray you, whether this is not all a
   mistake! In what are you better than other men, after all? What if you
   do not indulge in open sins--does not your heart often go a-lusting
   towards evil? Does your tongue always speak that which is right and
   true? If you cannot remember sins of commission, what about the sins of
   omission? Have you fed the hungry? Have you clothed the naked? Have you
   taught the ignorant? Have you loved God with all your heart and soul
   and strength? Have you given Him all that He demands of you? Why you
   cannot say this!

   Now the perfection, the holiness which God demands in order to
   salvation must be like a perfect alabaster vase--if there is a single
   crack or spot on it--all is spoiled. You may say, "Well, it is not much
   broken. We have not seriously damaged it." No, but God requires it to
   be perfect and no matter how slight the damage it may have sustained,
   you cannot enter Heaven upon the footing of your good works--you are
   cast out forever! Hear these words, "By the deeds of the Law there
   shall no flesh be justified in His sight." "Cursed is everyone that
   continues not in all things which are written in the Book of the Law to
   do them." And, "As many as are of the works of the Law are under the
   curse." God save you from that false excuse!

   Another class says, "We are too bad to be saved. The Gospel cries,
   'Believe in Jesus Christ and live,' but it cannot mean me. I have been
   too gross an offender. When I was but young I went into evil and since
   then I have gone from bad to worse. O Sir, I have cursed God to His
   face! I have sinned against light and knowledge, against a mother's
   prayers and tears. I have spoken evil of God's Word! I have laughed at
   the very name of His Son Jesus Christ! I am too evil to be saved." Here
   is another bad excuse. You know, Sinner, if you have been a hearer of
   the Gospel, that this is not true! For bad as you are, no man is
   excluded from Christ on account of his vileness. "All manner of sin and
   of blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men."

   The invitations of the Gospel do not stop at a certain point of sin. On
   the contrary, they seem to select the worst sinners first. What did the
   Savior say? "Begin at Jerusalem." But, Lord, the men who crucified You
   live there! "Begin at Jerusalem." But, Lord, it was in Jerusalem that
   they shed Your blood and thrust out the tongue and laughed at You and
   made a mockery of Your prayers! "Begin at Jerusalem"--the worst
   first--just as the surgeon in a battle is apt to look to the worst
   cases first. Here is a man who has lost his finger. Ah, well, let him
   bide awhile, we will see to that. But here is another who has lost a
   limb and he is bleeding fast and if the blood is not stopped, his life
   will ooze out. The surgeon sees him first.

   O you great sinners, you who feel yourselves to have been notorious
   offenders, I pray you are not so guilty as to make this an excuse for
   not coming to Christ! On the contrary, use it as a reason why you
   should fly to Him at once. The more filth, the more need of washing.
   The more sick, the more need of a physician. The more hungry, the more
   welcome to the table. Come to Jesus just as you are, with all your
   sins--"Though they are as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.
   Though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool." No form of
   sin imaginable or unimaginable can by any possibility be a bar to any
   man's salvation if he will but believe on the Lord Jesus Christ!

   Then comes another excuse, "Sir, I would trust Christ with my soul this
   morning, but I do not feel in any state to trust Christ. I have not
   that sense of sin which I think to be a fit preparation for coming to
   Christ--

   " 'If anything is felt, 'tis only pain To find I cannot feel.'"

   Ah, my dear Hearer, this is an excuse which looks like a very good one,
   but it has no truth in it! There is no fitness needed before you may
   trust in Christ! Whatever may be your present condition, if you trust
   Jesus Christ with your soul you are saved on the spot! Your sins are
   forgiven you! You are made a child of God! You are accepted in the
   Beloved! Where do you read of fitness for Christ in the Scriptures? Do
   you think the dead whom Jesus restored were fit to be raised? Why,
   Martha said of her brother, "Lord, by this time he stinks, for he has
   been dead four days"! Was there any fitness in Lazarus for a
   resurrection? And yet Jesus said, "Lazarus, come forth!" Does the
   Gospel say, "He who is in a certain state, and then believes, shall be
   saved"? No, but, "He that believes and is baptized, shall be saved."

   How am I bid to preach to you? Am I to say, "Whoever feels this is to
   come"? No, but, "Whoever will, let him come and take the water of life
   freely." Are you willing to have Christ? Then you may have Him, for
   Christ is as free to every needy sinner as the drinking fountain in the
   street is free to every thirsty passer-by. Trust Jesus, even if your
   heart is hard as granite--He can soften it! Trust Him though conscience
   is asleep--though all the mental faculties are perverted! Trust Him! It
   is His business to make you holy, not your business--trust Him to do it
   all! He is called Jesus because He saves His people from their sins!

   Trust Him to overcome your corruptions, to kill your evil temper, to
   subdue your will, to soften your heart, to enlighten your conscience,
   to inflame your love--trust Him to do it ALL! O, be not so foolish as
   to say, "I am too ill to send for a doctor--when I get better, when I
   feel better, then I will send for him." Do not say, "I am so dirty. If
   I felt more clean, I would wash." No--wash because you are dirty! Wash
   because you have nothing but filth about you! Send for the Great
   Physician because there is no health in you! There is nothing in you
   but wounds, bruises and putrefying sores. Therefore let your faith
   entrust your healing entirely to Him.

   Here comes another: "O Sir, I would trust Christ with my soul, but it
   seems too good to be true that God should save me on the spot, this
   morning. You little know where I was last night, or what I did
   yesterday. You cannot tell who I am nor how bad I have been and you
   tell me that if I trust Jesus Christ, I shall be saved. Sir, it is too
   good to be true! I cannot imagine it." My dear Friend, do you measure
   God's corn with your bushel? Because the thing seems an amazing thing
   to you, should it therefore be amazing unto Him? What if His thoughts
   should be as high above your thoughts as the heavens are above the
   earth? Is not this just what He has said in Scripture? I know you find
   it hard to forgive your fellow man, but my Father, my God, can readily
   forgive you!--

   "Crimes of such horror to forgive, Such guilty daring worms to spare--
   This is Your grand prerogative And none shall in the honor share."

   He creates like a God! He does not make a few insects, or here and
   there a star! This great world He fashioned and He scattered the starry
   orbs about with both His hands. So when the Lord comes to pardon, He
   does not pardon some small offenses and wink at trifles--but the whole
   mass of sin He cleans away in a moment and all manner of sin and
   blasphemy, in an instant He casts behind His back. Believe that God is
   God and not such a one as you are! Believe that He is capable of doing
   greater things than you can dream of! Trust Him! Trust Him NOW and
   however good the things are you shall find them true! However great,
   they shall be yours! I think I hear one say, "It is too soon for me to
   come. Let me have a little look at the world first. I am scarcely
   fifteen or sixteen. There is plenty of time for me."

   Have you been to the graveyard" Are there not there the records of
   those who have found fifteen or sixteen none too soon, for lo, at that
   age they were taken away to their last account? Too soon? Is it ever
   too soon to be happy? If religion made you miserable I might advise you
   to put it off to the last, but inasmuch as to be in Christ is to be
   happy, you cannot be in Him too soon! I have sat by many deathbeds and
   heard many regrets, but never did I hear a Christian regret that he was
   converted too soon! I have received many young converts into Church
   fellowship, but I never heard any one of them say they were sorry to be
   called by Grace so early!

   If I were condemned to die and anyone should bring me a pardon, I
   should not think I received it too soon! The wrath of God abides on
   you--can it be too soon to escape from it? You are the subject of daily
   temptations and you daily add to your sins--can it be too soon to have
   a new heart and a right spirit? Others will row in the opposite
   direction, pleading, "Alas, it is too late!" The devil first puts the
   clock back and tells you it is too soon--and when this does not serve
   his turn--he puts it on and says, "The hour is passed, the day of Grace
   is over! Mercy's gate is bolted, you can never enter it!"

   Let us answer this at once. It is never too late for a man to believe
   in Jesus while he is out of his grave. While the lamp of life continues
   to burn, the vilest sinner who returns shall find Christ ready to
   receive him. There have been men converted at a hundred years of
   age--we have instances on record of persons who have even passed the
   century and become children of Christ Jesus! How old are you? Are you
   in the sere and yellow leaf of eighty? Ah, you have many sins, but what
   a triumph of Grace it will be when eighty years of sin shall all be
   washed away in a moment! I tell you that if you were as old as
   Methuselah and in every year of that long life you had as many sins as
   you have already committed in the whole eighty years, yet the Grace of
   Jesus Christ is sufficient to put all this away!

   Your sins may mount up like mountains, but the love of Christ, like
   Noah's flood, can go twenty cubits upwards and the tops of the
   mountains shall be covered. It is not too soon! It is not too late!
   Neither of these reasons are of any value though they delude many.
   "Well," says another, "I would believe in Christ but I do not know
   whether I am one of God's elect or not. Sir, that doctrine of election
   troubles me and staggers me. If I knew I was one of the elect, I would
   trust Christ."

   That is--if God will show you His secrets then you will do God's will.
   And so the Almighty is to bend to your conditions and then you will do
   as He bids you? You will come to feast at the man's table if he will
   take you into his secret closet and show you all his treasure! He will
   do nothing of the kind! How foolish this talk is about election! The
   doctrine of election is a great and precious Truth of God, but it never
   can be a valid reason for a man's not believing in Christ! You are ill
   today and the doctor comes, "There," says he, "there is the medicine, I
   will guarantee if you take it, it will heal you." You say, "Sir, I
   would take it at once, but I do not know whether I am predestinated to
   get over this fever. If I am predestinated to live, why then, Sir, I
   will take the medicine, but I must know first." "Ah," says the doctor,
   "I tell you what. If you do not take it you are predestinated to die."

   And I will tell you this--if you will not believe in Jesus Christ you
   will be damned, be you who you may--but you will not be able to lay it
   at predestination's door! It will be at your own. A man has fallen
   overboard. A rope is thrown to him, but he says, "I should like to
   grasp that rope only I do not know whether I am predestinated to be
   drowned." Fool! He will go down to the bottom with a lie in his mouth!
   We do not say, "I would sit down to dinner today, but I will not eat
   because I do not know whether I am predestinated to have any dinner
   today." We do not talk so foolishly in common things! Why, then, do we
   so in religion? When men are hard up for an excuse they are glad to run
   to the mysteries of God to use them as a veil to cover their faces. O
   my dear Friends, you must know that though God has a chosen people--yet
   when He commands you to believe in Christ--His having a chosen people,
   or not having a chosen people cannot excuse you from obedience to the
   Divine Command--"Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be
   saved."

   I could not attempt to go through all the excuses and therefore after
   handling two more, I will have done. "Well," says one, "if I were to
   believe in Christ I should be as bad, after a short time, as I used to
   be. I might be a little better for a time, but I should go back
   again--so it is of no use trusting Christ." That is to say, dear
   Friend, Jesus Christ says if you trust Him, He will save you--but you
   say if you trust Him, He will not save you! That is what it comes to.
   Jesus Christ promises that if you trust Him, He will save you from your
   sins. You say, "No, I should go back to my sins and be as bad as
   before."

   Which am I to believe--your excuse, or His promise? Why, Christ's
   promise, surely! "But I tried once before," says one. Very likely you
   did, but Christ never tried! If He had tried He would have succeeded.
   "Well, but, I did hold on a certain length of time." I dare say you
   did--you held on. But if Christ had hold of you, He would never have
   let you go.

   When you get hold of Christ you may soon drop Him--but when Jesus gets
   hold ofyou, He says, "I give unto My sheep eternal life and they shall
   never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of My hand." If you
   had greatly trusted Christ He would not have suffered you to become
   what you used to be. "Well," says one, "I cannot trust Christ, I cannot
   believe Him."

   You talk Latin, Brother! You talk Latin. "No," you say, "I do not talk
   Latin." Yes, you do. I will translate that word into the English for
   you. It means, "I will not." When you say, "I cannot," it means, "I
   will not." And understand, whenever the minister says, "You cannot," he
   means, "you will not," for he does not mean that you have any natural
   inability, but that you have a moral inability caused by your love of
   sin--a willful inability. "I cannot," is the Latin, but "I will not,"
   is the English of it. A man once sent his servant to a certain town to
   fetch some goods. And he came back without them. "Well, Sir, why did
   you not go there?" Well, when I got to a certain place, I came to a
   river, Sir, a very deep river--I cannot swim and I had no boat--so I
   could not get over."

   A good excuse, was it not? It looked so. But it happened to be a very
   bad one, for the master said, "Is there not a ferry there?" "Yes, Sir."
   "Did you ask the man to take you over?" "No, Sir." Surely the excuse
   was a mere fiction! So there are many things with regard to our
   salvation which we cannot do. Granted, but there is a ferry there!
   There is the Holy Spirit who is able to do all things and you remember
   the text, "If you, then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto
   your children, how much more shall your Father which is in Heaven give
   good things to them that ask Him?" It is true you cannot make yourself
   a new heart, but did you ask for a new heart with sincerity and truth?
   Did you seek Christ? If you say, "Yes, I did sincerely seek Christ and
   Christ would not save me," why then you are excused.

   But there never was a soul who could, in truth, say that! There never
   was a sinner yet who perished seeking Christ and there never will be!
   And if your heart's sincere desire is after the salvation which is
   treasured in Christ Jesus, then Heaven and earth may pass away but
   Christ will never cast you out while His own Word stands, "Him that
   comes to Me I will in no wise cast out." "Still," you say, "I cannot
   trust Christ." Now, I am at issue with you here--I am at issue with
   every awakened sinner. I agree with you if you will let me give my own
   translation of the word "cannot"--that you will not--but if it is to
   stand as the word is generally used, I am at issue with you.

   Suppose that you believe me to be an honest man. Would it be fair after
   that, to say, "Sir, I cannot believe you"? Now, if you believe me to be
   a liar, I can very well understand that you cannot trust me. But if you
   take it for granted that I am incapable of telling a falsehood and yet
   do not believe what I tell you, you are a liar! Now, you believe that
   Christ is incapable of falsehood--you are not like those who are
   ignorant of the Character of Christ and therefore you know Him to be
   incapable of untruthfulness. And then you say you cannot believe Him?
   Seeing that Jesus Christ cannot but speak Truth, it cannot be a
   difficult thing for any man to believe what He speaks! If you have
   sufficient light given you by the Holy Spirit to know that Christ is
   the Truth, I believe you have sufficient power from the same source to
   believe what Christ says.

   I trace this to God's gift, but I pray you to exercise the power which
   you certainly have. Tell Christ you cannot believe Him? Will you tell
   Him that to His face when He sits upon the Judgment Seat at last? Will
   you dare to say this when His eyes of fire shall look you through and
   through? "Most holy Christ, I could not trust You! Most truthful
   Savior, I could not believe You! I suspected You. I doubted You!" "Why
   did you doubt Me? What cause had I ever given you? Why did you think Me
   a liar? In what had I ever broken My promises, or when did I err from
   the Truth?" "He that believes not," says John, "has made God a liar,
   because he believes not the record that God gave of His Son." O, think
   of this and never make that excuse again! Instead of saying, "I cannot
   believe," say, "I cannot make God a liar, I must therefore believe, for
   I know God is no liar--I must therefore trust His Son Jesus Christ!

   I have recounted a few of the excuses. Perhaps you will make another
   batch before the evening comes on--you who determine not to be saved.
   It is only the mighty Spirit of God who can sweetly constrain your will
   to yield to Christ and so I close with these two or three words, upon
   the third point.

   III. HOW FOOLISH THUS TO MAKE EXCUSES! For first remember with Whom it
   is you are dealing. You are not making excuses before a man who may be
   duped by them--you make these excuses before the heart-searching God!
   My dear Hearers, let me speak very solemnly and push this point closely
   home. You know that God can see through all this--why, then, do you
   hang up such thin veils? Confess before Him now your folly--"Lord, I
   have been an enemy to

   You. Lord, I have been averse to Your Son, Jesus Christ, and therefore
   have I dreamed up these excuses--forgive me. I see how foolish I have
   been. Grant that I may do so no more."

   Remember again, what it is you are trifling with. It is your own soul,
   the soul which can never die! You are trifling with a Heaven which you
   will never see if you keep on with these excuses. You are trifling,
   Sinner, with that Hell which must be your never-ending portion if you
   continue as you are. Can you play with Hell-fire? O, can you make sport
   of Heaven? Can you laugh at the blood of Jesus? You are really doing so
   while you are thus halting between two opinions. If you must play the
   fool, find something cheaper to play with than this! O Sirs, if you
   must have mirth, I pray you have it out of something else than this.

   To be saved! Listen to Heaven's music! To be lost! Listen to Hell's
   groans! Neither of these things are matters for you to play with. Say,
   as now you are sitting here--I pray God help you to say it before you
   leave this building--"Lord, I have been trifling with eternity. I have
   been making frivolous excuses rather than I would accept Your love in
   Christ. I have trifled with Heaven and Hell--grant, Lord, that this may
   be brought to an end--that I may love and trust You this day."

   Remember, again, that these excuses will look very different soon. How
   will you make excuses when you come to die, as die you must? When death
   gets the grip of you and the strong man fails. When they wipe the death
   sweat from your fevered brow. When the glaze of death's night is coming
   over your eyeballs--what will you think of these excuses then? It may
   be you will rave with very fury at yourselves that you could have
   played with your souls to such an extent. What will you do with your
   excuses when you stand at the bar of Judgment? The trumpet rings, you
   have awakened from your grave, you stand amidst the myriads to be
   judged. The books are opened and Christ proclaims your doom--"Depart,
   you cursed, into everlasting fire." Will excuses comfort you then? Will
   you be able to say, then, "Lord, it was too soon! Lord, it was too
   late! Lord, I was too great a sinner to believe in Jesus! Lord I did
   not need a Savior"?

   No, when the trumpet peals and the heavens are in a blaze. When the sun
   is turned into sackcloth and the moon into blood and the stars fall
   like fig leaves from the tree, you will find other work to do than
   excuse-making! You will weep and wail because of sin and when you are
   cast into Hell what will you make, then, of your excuses? Written in
   letters of fire you shall see in one tremendous arch above your heads,
   "You knew your duty, but you did it not! You heard the Gospel, but you
   made excuses!" Thundering more tremendous than the trump of
   resurrection shall come these words to you, "Because I have called and
   you refused, I have stretched out My hand and no man regarded, I, also,
   will laugh at your calamity. I will mock when your fear comes. When
   your fear comes as desolation and your destruction comes as a
   whirlwind. When distress and anguish come upon you."

   O, the Lord have mercy upon you, excuse-makers, and bring you to look
   to Jesus now! Now, I say, for the Scripture says, "Today is the
   accepted time, today is the day of salvation." The only way to end your
   excuses is not by praying nor resolving, but by looking to Christ.
   There hangs the bleeding Savior on the Cross. He dies--the Just for the
   unjust--to bring us to God! He suffers there that sin may be forgiven!
   Look to Him! Trust Him and you shall be saved! My Hearer, I give you
   now in God's name this invitation, this command--trust your soul to
   Jesus, the Son of God, who suffered for sin--and you shall be saved!

   But mind you, I may never meet you all this side the grave but I will
   meet you all at God's Great Day and if you receive not Christ and trust
   in Him, I am clear of your blood. Upon my garments your doom cannot
   fall. You have heard the Gospel! You have been told to trust Jesus as
   you are! You have been assured that He is able to save to the uttermost
   them that come to Him! You have been bid to come and now on your own
   heads be your soul's ruin if you come not!

   May the Spirit of God take these things and apply them to your souls.
   May He be as a fire and as a hammer in your souls--as a fire to melt,
   or as a hammer to break. And may you, today, with brokenness of heart
   take Christ to be your Savior, both now and forever. Amen.

              God Pleading For Saints, And Saints Pleading For God

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JULY 10, 1864, BY THE REV. C. H. SPURGEON,
   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "O Lord, You ha ve pleaded the causes of my soul; You have redeemed my
   life."

   Lamentations 3:58.

   THE Prophet speaks experimentally as of a matter which he had proved
   for himself. There is no true understanding of the Truths of God except
   by a personal experience of them. We have heard of men sitting in their
   drawing rooms and writing volumes on voyages and travels--but such
   books always bear the marks of fiction upon their title page--they can
   never vie in interest and freshness with the adventures of men who have
   actually traversed lands unknown. The botanist who shall never have
   seen a flower must necessarily be a mere pretender to the science. And
   the soldier who has never shouldered a gun is nothing but a raw
   recruit.

   And so the man who knows the Truth of God only in the letter of it, by
   what he has heard with his ears, but does not know it by what, "he has
   tasted and his hands have handled and his eyes have looked upon of the
   Word of Life," knows, indeed, nothing to any purpose and it were well
   for him to confess his ignorance. Our Prophet puts it not, "Lord, You
   have pleaded the causes of another man's soul," but, "You have pleaded
   the causes of my soul." At the opening of this discourse I invite you
   to ask yourselves whether you have an interest in this pleading. Has
   the Lord pleaded the causes of your soul?

   Such a suggestion may be of great service to you. That eminent Puritan
   preacher, Mr. Thomas Dolittle, was once teaching the catechism to the
   children of the congregation, as was the custom of the Puritans on
   Sunday. He came to the question, "What is effectual calling?" The
   answer was given, as it stands in our admirable catechism, "Effectual
   calling is the work of God's Spirit, whereby, convincing us of our sin
   and misery, enlightening our minds in the knowledge of Christ and
   renewing our wills, He does persuade and enable us to embrace Jesus
   Christ freely offered to us in the Gospel."

   The good man stopped and said to the lads around him, "Let us use the
   personal pronoun in the singular--are there any among you who can say
   that all this is yours?" To his great joy there stood up one who with
   many tears and many sobs, said, "Effectual calling is the work of God's
   Spirit, whereby, convincing me of my sin and misery, enlightening my
   mind in the knowledge of Christ and renewing my will, He has persuaded
   and enabled me to embrace Jesus Christ freely offered to me in the
   Gospel."

   Now this is the true way to understand any doctrine as set forth in the
   Word of God--by being able to feel that in your own personal case God
   has worked upon your soul--has brought you into reconciliation with
   Himself and enabled you to rejoice in His gracious promises! You are
   greatly blessed if, like the Prophet, you can speak experimentally. You
   must not fail to observe how positively he speaks. He does not say, "I
   hope, I trust, I sometimes think that God has pleaded the causes of my
   soul." He speaks of it as a matter of fact not to be disputed. "You
   have pleaded the causes of my soul."

   Let us, Brethren, by the aid of the gracious Comforter, shake off those
   doubts and fears which so much mar our peace and comfort! Be this our
   prayer today that we may have done with the harsh croaking voice of
   surmise and suspicion and may be able to speak with the clear,
   melodious voice of full assurance, "I know whom I have believed and am
   persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto
   Him." I like to hear a Christian, when he tells his own experience,
   speak of these things as one who knows what he is talking about--not as
   though it were all guesswork with him-- but as one who with infallible
   certainty, the Spirit of God bearing witness with his spirit, knows
   that he is speaking the Truth of God.

   "You have pleaded the causes of my soul." Here I must bid you observe
   how gratefully the Prophet speaks, ascribing all the glory to God
   alone. You perceive there is not a word concerning himself or his own
   pleadings. He does not ascribe his deliverance in any measure to any
   man, much less to his own merit. But it is "You"--"You, O Lord, have
   pleaded the causes of my soul; You have redeemed my life." A grateful
   spirit should ever be cultivated by the Christian. And especially after
   deliverances we should prepare a song for our God. O Believers, wake up
   your hearts and tune your tongues to compete with angels before the
   Throne! Earth should be a temple filled with the songs of grateful
   saints and every day should be a censer smoking with the sweet incense
   of thanksgiving! How joyful Jeremiah seems to be while he records the
   Lord's mercy! How triumphantly he lifts up the strain!

   He has been in the low dungeon and is even now no other than the
   Weeping Prophet, poor Jeremiah. And yet in the very book which is
   called, "Lamentations"--clear as the voice of Miriam when she dashed
   her fingers against the timbrel and shrill as the note of Deborah when
   she met Barak with shouts of victory--we hear the voice of Jeremy going
   up to Heaven--"You have pleaded the causes of my soul; You have
   redeemed my life"! O children of God, seek after a vital experience of
   the Lord's loving kindness and when you have it, speak positively of
   it! Sing gratefully! Shout triumphantly! And let none of your enemies
   stop your glorying this side of Heaven, for on the other side of the
   river the free Grace of God shall be your glory forever and ever--and
   you shall sing eternally, "You have pleaded the causes of my soul; You
   have redeemed my life."

   We shall occupy the time allotted to the sermon this morning, first, by
   considering Divine pleading as the Christian's joy. And then by talking
   about the Christian's pleading the causes of his God as his duty and
   delight. God pleads my cause--this is my joy. I must plead God's
   cause--this is at once my privilege and my reasonable service.

   I. First, then, let us come with heartfelt joy to the consideration of
   DIVINE PLEADING.

   1. The Lord pleads our cause in the Court of Providence. Jeremiah was
   confined in the low dungeon. He was cast into a wet, damp hole--a pit.
   And here he would have been left to rot for no one spoke a word for him
   except Ebed-melech, an Ethiopian eunuch, in the service of the king. He
   went to Zedekiah and pleaded on behalf of poor Jeremiah. The king gave
   Ebedmelech leave to fetch Jeremiah out of the pit. Now, you observe,
   Jeremiah was never ungrateful to Ebedmelech. Ebedmelech had a blessing
   in return for what he did, yet Jeremiah ascribes his deliverance not to
   the eunuch, but to God--"You have pleaded the causes of my soul."

   The Christian may expect that in the course of Providence, when he
   meets with trouble, God will raise up for him at different times and in
   unexpected quarters persons who will take an interest in him and be the
   means of working out his deliverance. God sits at the helm of
   Providence and when the vessel is almost on the rock, He can pilot it
   into the deep waters again! And when His servants have been obliged by
   the tempest to reef their sails, He knows how, as the Master of the
   seas, to change the winds to a gale so favorable that with all sails
   spread they can fly before the gale to the desired haven.

   Sometimes God pleads the cause of His people by silencing their
   enemies. What a remarkable instance you have of this in the case of
   Jacob! His sons had most cruelly and basely killed the Shechemites.
   Having betrayed them by false promises they then slew them in cold
   blood. Jacob said, "You have troubled me to make me to stink among the
   inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and Perizzites: and I
   being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me
   and slay me. And I shall be destroyed, I and my house." How strange was
   it that he suffered no molestation! Surely the Lord had cast a solemn
   awe upon the hearts of the Canaanites round about. His all-commanding
   voice was heard in their hearts, "Touch not My anointed and do my
   Prophet no harm."

   Even though Jacob's family was grossly in the wrong and his sons had
   committed a foul deed, yet nevertheless, the Lord pleaded the cause of
   His chosen servant and his enemies were as still as stones. It will
   often be so with the Lord's peculiar ones. When your foot has
   slipped--when you have spoken unadvisedly with your lips--if you have
   deeply repented of the sin you may leave the matter before God, and He
   will either silence every dog's tongue, or turn their barking to His
   glory.

   At other times our God has pleaded the cause of His people by raising
   up friends for them. Take the instance of Joseph. Reuben pleads for him
   when his Brethren intend to kill him. When in Egypt he is put into the
   dungeon through a false charge brought by the wife of Potiphar. He is
   not treated as a common criminal, for even in the dungeon God finds him
   friends. He behaves himself so discreetly that the master of the prison
   makes him one of the keepers of the ward! The Lord gave him favor in
   the eyes of men.

   Observe another case. Here comes a poor maiden from Moab with her
   mother-in-law. God will plead the cause of her soul. She goes, as many
   another maid had done, to the field to glean. Providence guides her to
   the estate of an unknown kinsman. Boaz looks upon her and before long
   she becomes the joy of his house and the mistress of his fields. Take a
   yet more remarkable case. Moses is put into the ark of bulrushes. What
   can the child say for itself? Among the crocodiles it lies exposed to
   imminent hazard. Pharaoh's daughter comes. What was that mysterious
   influence which softened her heart when she looked upon that comely
   child as it wept in that little cradle which might soon have been its
   coffin?

   Why was it that she said, "This is one of the Hebrews' children...take
   it and nurse it for me"? Why, it could only have been because God has a
   way of touching human hearts and making them friendly to His own
   people! He pleads the cause of His servants. He does not violate the
   wills of their enemies, but He wisely turns those wills into the
   channel of friendship. It was very remarkable that David, when he so
   much needed a friend through Saul's hostility to him, should have found
   one near to the throne--the heir-apparent to the kingdom. Strange that
   Jonathan, who naturally would have taken his father's part and would
   have hated David as a supplanter, should, nevertheless, have his soul
   so knit to the heart of David that he gives up his crown cheerfully and
   makes a covenant with David!

   Dear Friends, you thus see that either by silencing enemies, or else by
   raising up friends, God can, in Providence, plead the cause of your
   soul! Or if men should seem to have even less than this to do with it,
   He knows how, by special Providences, to bring you out of the depth of
   your difficulties. You see this again in the case of Joseph. He was put
   in prison. The butler promised to speak for him, but forgot him. Well,
   what shall happen? The king must dream a dream. Pharaoh cannot sleep
   while Joseph is in the dungeon. Seven years of plenty must come and
   seven years of famine, in order that Joseph, falsely accused, might
   have his "righteousness brought forth as brightness and the salvation
   thereof as a lamp that burns."

   Such cases will commonly occur. No Christian man, I think, can look
   back through many years of his life without observing some strange and
   singular workings of the Divine hand by which, in an unexpected manner,
   God has worked his deliverance. Come then, if this is so--let us be of
   good cheer this morning! We need not fret and worry ourselves about
   worldly things for our heavenly Father pleads our cause! Tried Soul, He
   knows what you need this morning! You have not told anybody your
   distress and you need not, for He "knows that you have need of these
   things." He knows when it will be best for you to receive help. And if
   He keeps you a little time in poverty, He knows it is good for you to
   be left in the shade.

   He understands Providence better than you do and He can make the great
   world a broad work to bless the little world of your heart. There is
   not a single wheel by which the machinery of Providence is affected
   which is not turned by His hand. You know His love to be as infinite as
   His wisdom and His power to be as great as His love--then go where your
   Master went when He was in the storm--to the rear of the ship and fall
   asleep upon the pillow of the Providence of God! You have done your
   best. You have worked hard. You have strived to provide things honestly
   in the sight of all men--and yet things do not prosper with you as you
   wish they would. You are content to be poor--you are willing to be in
   just such a place as God would put you and yet your straits and your
   difficulties seem just now to be too many for you!

   Now is the time to exercise faith upon a living God! Your God is not
   worth having if He cannot help you when you want help. Surely your
   religion must be a lie if it cannot buoy you up under troubles which,
   after all, are not the heaviest which fall to the lot of men. Come,
   cast your burden on your God--He cares for you! Before many days are
   past you shall come up to this house, if not with these words upon your
   tongue, yet with this sentiment in your heart, "You have pleaded the
   causes of my soul; You have redeemed my life."

   2. Our text may be read with great comfort if we think upon the Court
   of Divine Law. You and I may picture ourselves this morning, without
   exaggeration or untruth, as being led into the Court of the Law. The
   Law at once arraigns us upon the charge of having positively broken the
   Commands of God. "He has broken every one of them," says the Law,
   "either in deed, or word, or thought. There is not a single precept
   which this man has not most distinctly set at defiance."

   The witnesses appear. The devil willingly bears witness and adds many
   falsehoods to the accusation. The Omniscience of God stands as a swift
   witness against us. And our own conscience is compelled to bear
   testimony that we have, indeed, sinned and that we have "gone astray
   from the womb, speaking lies." What is now to be done? We are asked if
   we have anything to say. Why sentence should not be pronounced upon us.
   We are silent. Well may we hold down our heads, for what reason is
   there why we should not be punished for the sins which we have
   committed? There was a time when we would have pleaded, "Not guilty,"
   but we know better now. We know our guilt. It stares us in the face. We
   cannot plead the force of temptation, for we know that often we have
   tempted ourselves and have, without any incentive beyond our own
   hearts, run greedily after sin.

   The Law sits upon its throne of judgment and since we cannot plead, it
   makes proclamation, "Is there anyone in court who will act as advocate
   for this rebel whose silence and shame witness to his guilt? If there
   is none to show cause to the contrary, I will open the Great Book and
   read his sentence. I will put on the black cap and he shall be taken to
   doom." Up stands the bleeding Savior, the great Advocate for sinners!
   What does Jesus plead? "O Justice," says He, "I plead not that these
   men have not sinned--I do confess on their behalf that they have
   grievously erred. But I plead for them that their sin has been
   punished--punished in Me. All the curse of their sin was laid on Me.

   "I loved them from before the foundations of the world. And having
   loved them I took their sin upon Myself and therefore it is not on
   them. I suffered in their place and therefore, Justice, you cannot
   punish two for one offense-- having struck Me for them--you cannot now
   strike them. I plead My blood--these wounds of Mine, once opened by the
   cruel nails--this side of Mine, once rent with the spear--I plead
   these--My groans, My tears, My agony, My death-- for these I suffered
   on their account. Their sin was punished in Me. Let them go free!"

   Thus He pleads right gloriously. Who shall answer Him? What more is
   wanted? But the Law brings another charge. It says, "Granted that sin
   is condoned by the Atonement. Allowed that through Your sacrifice, most
   glorious Redeemer, Your people are free from sin, yet I demand on the
   behalf of God that the Law should be kept! These men were bound not
   merely to be negatively without sin, but they were bound positively to
   serve God with all their heart and soul and strength. And inasmuch as
   they have not done it, they cannot enter Heaven. How shall they be
   rewarded for service never performed--how shall they win the crown
   without having kept the command?"

   Here, too, we are silent, for what have we ever done? What
   righteousness have we? Are not our righteousnesses filthy rags, the
   very best of them? We dare not say, "Lord, my prayers entitle me to
   Heaven. My preaching, my doings, my almsgivings." No, we know better
   than this! We feel that we are vile and full of sin and therefore put
   our finger on our lips and confess that we deserve to be shut out of
   Heaven. Again the Savior rises and He pleads, "I was appointed of God
   to be their Substitute and being such I kept the Law on their behalf!
   The whole of the Ten Commandments I have carried out to the fullest
   extent both in the letter and in the spirit. I have served God with all
   My soul and strength.

   "I have loved My neighbor as Myself. I have been obedient to death,
   even to the death of the Cross. Have I not magnified the Law and made
   it honorable?" The Law bows its awful head and confesses, "You have, O
   Jesus, rendered better obedience than these men could have rendered,
   for You are Divine. You have brought the righteousness of God instead
   of the righteousness of man. You have brought Your own perfection,
   glorified and exalted by the splendor of Your Nature and laid it down
   in the place of the perfection of man which he could not bring. You
   have, indeed, paid the debt. You have pleaded well and the culprit is
   free!"

   Beloved, "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is
   God that justifies. Who is he that condemns? It is Christ that died,
   yes rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God,
   who also makes intercession for us." My Soul, triumph in your God! This
   day rejoice with all your might, for Christ has prevalently pleaded
   your cause and you are acquitted--no, you are brought in as meritorious
   and accepted in the sight of God through the plea of the Beloved! Let
   us rejoice that in the court of Heaven's justice we can say, "You have
   pleaded the causes of my soul." O, can we all say it? Has Christ
   pleaded for you? Has your faith put your soul into Christ's hands? If
   not, I pity you. And let every child of God pity and pray for you. But
   if Jesus pleads for you we will rejoice together and be glad this
   morning!

   3. In the third place, Jesus pleads the cause of my soul in the Court
   of Conscience which is a minor imitation of the great Court of Heaven.
   Let me talk to your hearts now, Brothers and Sisters, as the Lord helps
   me. Sometimes you have doubts and fears springing up and conscience
   assists them, for it says, "You know what a guilty worm you are! What?
   You a saved soul? It was but the other day that you were murmuring at
   God, and doubting His faithfulness!

   Look at your prayers--what cold things they are! See your daily
   life--what inconsistencies mingle with it! Mark your temper--how quick!
   How fierce! Look at yourself as to spiritual things--was there ever a
   more poverty-stricken soul than you are? Why, you are as black as the
   tents of Kedar and quite as filthy. Can you see any good thing in your-
   self? Why, are you not a very sink of corruption, a walking dunghill, a
   mass of abominations? And yet you say, 'I am a child of God'? How can
   it be?" And now, when these thoughts arise, you and I find it sometimes
   rather hard to answer them. And if we go upon the common logic of human
   reason and begin to argue, "But I do find in myself some humblings of
   soul. I have some melting desires towards the Lord God. I find this and
   that and therefore I have some evidence," it is ten to one that
   conscience and the devil together will beat us and we shall be ready to
   lie down in despair.

   But, oh, how sweet it is when our soul tells of the finished work of
   the Lord Jesus Christ! Then--I hope that I am now talking what you all
   know and many of you know sweetly--then as you turn to Jesus Christ and
   see the precious Person of the perfect Savior pouring out streams of
   cleansing blood--there is a voice which speaks to you and pleads the
   cause of your soul! You feel, "Let conscience say what he may, this
   blood has answered him! Let the devil suggest what he will, this
   complete Atonement shall shut his mouth!" "I will," says Rutherford, in
   one of his sweet letters, "I will hold to Christ under water and if I
   must drown I will not let go my hold of Him."

   And so the Believer can say he has got such a grip of Jesus--such a
   hand-hold of the Savior--that though ten thousand times ten thousand
   fears should roll over his head, he sings--

   "I do believe, I will believe That Jesus died for me."

   Sometimes after stern conflicts a sweet peace pervades your mind. I
   cannot describe it better than by the calm which succeeds the tempest
   and its heavy showers. The whole earth appears to put on a greener
   dress than before. The flowers pour out their fragrance. The birds sing
   and men rejoice in the clear shining after the rain. So is it with us.
   "The time of the singing of birds is come and the voice of the turtle
   is heard in our land," because Jesus Christ applies with Divine power
   His own merits and His own blood to our conscience and all is well!

   I do not know whether you know what this means, but if any of you do
   not, you have lost a joy worth a thousand worlds! For out of Heaven I
   know of no peace like that which pervades the conscience when Jesus
   pleads within. Guilty we are in ourselves, but we are "complete in
   Him." Foul and vile I am and yet I am perfect in Christ Jesus--lost,
   ruined and undone in the first Adam--but saved and redeemed--made to
   sit in heavenly places in the Second Adam. Ah, doubts and fears--where
   are they now--when Jesus pleads for my soul? Memory may come and tell
   me all the past. Fear may haunt me with black visions of the future--my
   powers may be perverted to the service of despair--yet if my soul can
   keep her hold upon the finished work of my Redeemer I shall yet come
   off more than conqueror, singing, "You have pleaded the causes of my
   soul; You have redeemed my life."

   4. We have thus been to three courts--the Court of Providence, the
   Court of Justice and the Court of Conscience. And now, pausing awhile,
   I would not have you forget how Jesus Christ pleads our cause in the
   Court of Heaven. To a true-hearted man who lives a life of prayer it is
   ever a rich consolation that his prayers do not go up to Heaven alone.
   Jesus, our great High Priest, never ceases to intercede for His saints!

   A poor man once wished to have a favor of a great one. This great lord
   had a son--a very kind and condescending one, who spoke to the poor man
   and said--"If you will write a petition to my father, he is very
   gracious and he will be sure to grant it. And so that you may have no
   doubts about the success of your petition, give it to me and I will
   take it in my own hand up to my father's house for you and make your
   case my own. I will say to him, 'My father, hear this poor man's
   petition, not for his own sake, but consider it as mine. Do me the
   personal favor and kindness of hearing this man's prayer, as though it
   were my prayer--for, indeed, I make it mine!' "

   The poor man wrote out his petition, but when he had finished it, "Alas
   !"he said to himself, "this will never do to present before the great
   one. It is so full of errors! I have blotted it with my tears and where
   I have tried to scratch out a word which I had spelt wrongly, I have
   made it worse and have so badly worded the whole petition that I am
   afraid the great one will throw it in the fire, or never notice it."
   "But," said his friend, "I will write it out in a fair clear hand for
   you so that there shall be no blots and no blunders. And when I have
   done so, I will do as I have said--I will take it in my own hand, put
   my own name at the bottom of it with your name and will offer it as our
   joint petition. And I will put it upon this footing, 'My father, do it
   for me. Not for him, but for me.' "

   When the poor man saw his petition thus written out and knew it was in
   such hands, he went his way sure that the answer must come. And come it
   did. You know that story well. This is what Jesus Christ has done for
   you! He takes our poor unworthy prayers and amends them. He makes them
   perfect and sprinkles His own blood upon them and takes them up before
   His Father's Throne, and says, "Father, for My sake hear this sinner.
   For My sake give him pardon. Accept him and preserve him." And then the
   gracious Father, who can deny nothing to His beloved Son, gives His
   glad assent and the blessing comes to you! This is a great mercy, but I
   will tell you of something which is a greater mercy still. It is
   transcendently encouraging that when we pray, Jesus Christ prays! But
   what is better still, is, that when we do not pray Jesus Christ prays!

   Oh, my soul was ravished a little while ago when thinking over that
   passage about Peter--"Simon, Simon, Satan has desired to have you that
   he may sift you as wheat. But"--what? "But go and pray for yourself"?
   Well, that were good advice, but it is not so put. Our Master does not
   say, "But I will keep you watchful and so you shall be preserved." That
   were a great blessing, but it is, "But I have prayed for you, that your
   faith fail not." Oh, you do not know when Jesus Christ prays for you!
   We pass through unseen dangers and we little know what are the dangers
   through which we pass!

   We are something like Christian, when Bunyan pictures him as going
   through the valley of the shadow of death. He could hear the howling on
   the right hand and on the left, but he did not know--for it was very
   dark--how very bad the way was. But when the sun rose and he looked
   back and saw the pits and the traps and the quagmires and the fiends
   and evil spirits--then he could not but lift up his hands in
   astonishment that he had been brought through them all! When you and I
   get on the hilltops of Heaven and look back upon all the way whereby
   the Lord our God has led us, even the songs of Heaven will not be loud
   enough for the gratitude we shall feel towards Him who, before the
   Eternal Throne, undid the mischief which Satan was doing upon earth!

   O, how shall we thank Him that He never held His peace--that day and
   night He pointed to the wounds upon His hands and carried our names
   upon His breastplate? How we shall adore our great High Priest! With
   what transport shall we kiss those dear feet of His when we remember
   that He did never cease to intercede, but that even before Satan had
   began to tempt He had forestalled him and entered a plea in Heaven! You
   know He does not say, "Satan has sifted you and therefore I will pray,"
   but, "Satan has desired to have you." He catches Satan even in his very
   desire--nips his desire in the bud--kills the cockatrice while it is
   yet in the shell.

   He does not say, "But I have desired to pray for you." No, it is, "I
   have prayed for you. I have done it already. I have gone to Court and
   entered a counterplea even before the charge is made. I have
   countermined even before the mine has been dug. "O Jesus, what a
   comfort it is that You have pleaded the causes of my soul when I have
   been asleep! When I might have gone sleeping on down to Hell You were
   awake pleading the causes of my soul!" Here, then, is a cause of great
   joy and great gratitude!

   5. Once more, Jesus Christ will plead the cause of His people and our
   heavenly Father will do so, too, in the Last Great Day of judgment. It
   is not a very pleasant thing for a man honestly to serve God and then
   to find his character taken from him. And yet, Beloved, this has been
   the lot of all true men in every age. The world never does permit a man
   to rebuke her follies without replying with a volley of mud. It she
   cannot stop the man's mouth, she blackens the man's character.

   If you will turn to the lives of any of the saints of God you will
   discover that they were the victims of slanders of the grossest kind.
   To this very day it is asserted by Romanists that Martin Luther was a
   drunkard. In his own day he was called the German beast--that for lust
   he had to marry Catharine! If you turn to the life of Whitfield--our
   great and mighty Whitfield--in more modern times what was his
   character? Why he was accused of every crime that even Sodom knew! And
   Perjury stood up and swore that all was true. As for Wesley--I have
   heard that on one occasion he said that he had been charged with every
   crime in the calendar except drunkenness. And when a woman stood up in
   the crowd and accused him of that, he then said, "Blessed God, I have
   now had all manner of evil spoken against me falsely for Christ's name
   sake!"

   You remember in the life of John Bunyan that episode concerning Agnes
   Beaumont? The good man suffered this young woman to ride behind him on
   his horse to a meeting at Gamlingay and for this his character was
   implicated in two charges before a magistrate which might have involved
   him in the crime of poisoning and laid the foundation for villainous
   reports of uncleanness! Yet John Bunyan was the purest and most
   heavenly-minded man who ever put his hand to paper. And he did put his
   hand to paper as no other man ever did who was not Inspired!

   Now, this is not pleasant, but if you are a true Christian and you are
   called to occupy a prominent post in the service of God, be resigned to
   this fact--expect to lose your character. Expect not to have the good
   opinion of any but your God and those faithful ones, who like you, are
   willing to bear contempt. But what joy it is for all these holy men to
   know that at the last God will plead the cause of their souls! There
   will be a resurrection of persons as they really were, not as they
   seemed to be and were misrepresented. At the Last Great Day there will
   be a resurrection of reputations--reputations which had been laid into
   the dark grave which Calumny had dug--which had been covered with the
   sod of Contempt and over which there had been raised an epitaph of
   Infamy.

   These reputations will all rise up! They have washed their robes and
   made them white. They are black no longer! The men who were pointed at
   and hooted and despised shall now go streaming up the shining way of
   fame and glory amidst the loud shouts of praise which the great Avenger
   shall receive from assembled worlds! They shall awake to Glory while
   others rise to shame and everlasting contempt! Oh, what must it be to
   be in the last day plucked and stripped of your plumes? What will be
   the fate of the Pharisee? Of the hypocrite who will find all his fine
   feathers torn away and himself left to hide his contemptible head in
   the caverns of the earth--but denied even that consolation--set out
   before the full blaze of day as an acknowledged liar before God and
   man?

   But how different the condition of the poor man who lived and died in
   undeserved contempt! He who wakes up to find himself a bright and
   shining spirit and all his adversaries compelled to admit that God has
   pleaded the causes of his soul and has avenged him of his accusers!
   Thus, you see, our text is not a small one--the words are few but full
   of meaning. And I have but very poorly set forth what our soul, I
   trust, feels to be the truth--"You have pleaded the causes of my soul;
   You have redeemed my life."

   II. Now I want your solemn and earnest attention while for a few
   minutes I plead for what is our reasonable service, namely, THAT IF THE
   LORD HAS PLEADED THE CAUSES OF OUR SOUL, WE SHOULD PLEAD HIS CAUSE

   WHILE WE HAVE ANY BREATH TO PRAY OR A TONGUE WITH WHICH TO BEAR WITNESS
   FOR HIM.

   Pleading the cause of Christ is the lifework of the Christian--it has
   to be done by some in the high places of the field. This age has given
   up all witness-bearing for Christ. We have grown so enamored of that
   gilded idol called charity that nowadays the Truth of God is fallen in
   the streets. It has come to be, by general consent, allowed by all men
   that religion is all very well in its way. That every man must keep his
   own religion and not meddle with other people's--that a lie may be a
   truth, or a truth may be a lie and that whether a doctrine is a truth
   or a lie does not matter a button--that, in fact, we are all of us to
   be agreed upon this one point--that God's Truth is not worthy our
   contending for.

   That which is of man's invention and that which is of God's teaching
   are now put side by side in alliance and a compromise is effected in
   the name of brotherly love. I look upon Christendom at this present day
   as too much like a putrid swamp, a stagnant pool--the calm is deep, but
   deadly. O for some holy wind to stir the rotting mass! Modern charity
   would gag the mouth of every advocate of the Truth of God and send
   every faithful minister of God back to his bed to sleep his time out
   until the millennium shall dawn!

   Brethren, I trust that an end shall come to this! And if bickering and
   strife and ill-will shall follow, though I shall lament these attendant
   evils, I shall rejoice that an earnest and healthy love of Truth and an
   earnest contention for it have been revived in the land. Rutherford,
   whose name must be dear to every Believer who knows his writings, says,
   "I thank God that I did never for a single moment put so much as a
   hoof, or a hair's breadth of Christ's Truth into compromise. That I did
   take Christ only and alone and did never leave room for the Roman
   harlot, but only for Christ--or Christ only!"

   Here was a man shut up in Aberdeen, driven away from Anworth, weeping
   because, as he said, he envied the very sparrows which flew around the
   old Kirk where he was used to having such sweet visions of his Lord.
   And yet he said if the giving up of a jot of the Truth of God could
   have given him his liberty and enabled him to go back to minister to
   his faithful flock, he would not give it up! For to him Truth was
   dearer than liberty--no, dearer than even life itself! He says, "I am
   prepared for all consequences. And if even black-faced Death should
   knock at my door, I would bid him enter." Our spiritual forefathers, on
   both sides the Tweed, were not men to be worried about the caprice of
   every oarsman.

   They knew the Truth of God and they knew Christ and they did not divide
   between Christ and Truth and say, "Love Christ and then believe what
   you like." No, they believed that Christ and Truth were identical. They
   believed Truth to be the Savior's crown jewels and they would as soon
   think of loving a king and trampling on his crown as of pretending to
   love Christ and then trampling on His Truth!

   What? Shall I pluck the clothes from my neighbor's back and tell him
   that I love him? Will you pluck the Truth from Christ and throw it away
   as though it were but old rags and then say you love Christ? You cannot
   love Christ if you do not love Truth. And you cannot have Jesus unless
   you are willing to take up your cross daily and follow Him. For my
   part, God helping me, my soul is set on this--to court no more the good
   word of any man--to be no more a worshipper at the shrine of that false
   goddess, Charity! To have all the brotherly love I can, but to show it
   by an honest, outspoken declaration that the day is come when Rome is
   not to stand in England unchallenged.

   Dressed in garments half Protestant and half Popish, the Church, as by
   law established, continues to make a mockery of honesty by using
   language in an unnatural sense! Juggling with men's souls! Pampering
   Puseyites, indulging infidels, and yet claiming to be evangelical. An
   end must come to the infamy of teaching Popish doctrine in the Prayer
   Book and then preaching evangelical doctrine in the pulpit. The day is
   come when we must shake our garments of such a Church and when the best
   of her sons, though we have fraternized with them, must come out from
   her or we can have no more communion with them! The day of Babylon's
   destruction comes! The cup is prepared and her sons and her daughters
   shall drink of it.

   And only they shall be found clear in the day of account who shall come
   out and plead the cause of God's pure Truth and God's pure Truth alone.
   I think my Master deserves this of those of us who stand upon the high
   places of the field. And of you who are less known, but love your
   Master none the less, march with us shoulder to shoulder! Bear reproach
   with us! We have to bear it! Be as willing to be rejected as we are
   willing to be rejected! Be as willing to lose character and name and
   reputation and standing as we are! And if you cannot speak with a voice
   which can be heard as far--yet proclaim with a voice as clear and
   plain--that you love Truth and Christ and that for Truth and Christ you
   will give up everything--but that you cannot give up these!

   Beloved, there is a way of bearing witness for Christ which you must
   adopt--that of witnessing by your consistency of conduct. Holiness is,
   after all, the mightiest weapon which a Christian can wield. Be you
   holy as Christ is holy. Let no man spatter mire upon your garments.
   Walk so that you never put us to grief. As a Church be so pure and
   heavenly that you may be called the Nazarites of God who were purer
   than snow and whiter than milk. And then, though we have no wealth and
   boast not gorgeous architecture and the swell of pealing music, yet we
   shall have this for our music--your holiness, your purity, your
   separation from all uncleanness. And this for our architecture--that
   you are built up as a temple for the Lord!

   Lastly, we can all plead for God in a private way. Oh, there is a great
   power in pleading for God with individuals. A man went to preach for
   seven summers on the village green and good was done. Joseph sometimes
   listened to the preacher, but only to ridicule him. There were many
   souls converted but he remained as hard as ever. A certain John who had
   felt the power of Truth, worked with him in the barn and one day,
   between the strokes of the flail, John spoke a word for Truth and for
   God. But Joseph laughed at him and hinted at hypocrisy and many other
   things.

   Now John was very sensitive and his whole soul was filled with grief at
   Joseph's banter and after he had spoken, feeling a flush of emotion, he
   turned to the corner of the barn and hid his face while a flood of
   tears came streaming from his eyes. He wiped them away with the corner
   of his sleeve and came back to his flail. Joseph had noticed the tears
   though John had tried to hide them. And what argument could not do and
   what preaching could not do, those tears, through God the Holy Spirit,
   did effectually, for Joseph thought to himself, "What? Does John care
   for my soul and weep for my soul? Then it is time I should care and
   weep for it, too."

   Beloved, witness thus for Christ! Be it mine to weep for the sins of
   the times and prophecy against them! Be it yours in your own private
   walk and conversation to rebuke private sin and by your loving
   earnestness to make Jesus Christ dear to many souls! Tell them that
   Jesus Christ came to save sinners! Tell them that He is able to save to
   the uttermost all who come to Him! Tell them that, "whoever believes on
   Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life," and in this way you
   shall plead the cause of God, who has pleaded the causes of your soul.

                                 God Is With Us

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JULY 17, 1864, BY THE REV. C. H. SPURGEON,
   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "If God is for us, who can be against us?" Romans 8:31.

   THE Truth of God here asserted is indisputable. Even heathens have
   taken this for their motto and emblazoned it upon their standards of
   war. "God is for us!" has been the war cry of many a warrior as he has
   dashed to the fight, however out of place it was in such association
   its force was clearly perceived. Our text, however, protects itself
   from ill usage, for you observe that the text is guarded with the
   little word, "If," as a sentinel. No man, therefore, has any right to
   the treasures of this text unless he can give the password and answer
   the question!

   It is not every man who can say that God is on his side. On the
   contrary, the most of men are fighting against the Lord. By nature we
   are the friends of sin and then God is against us--with all the powers
   of Justice He is against us for our destruction unless we turn and
   repent. Is God for us? Remember He is so if we have been reconciled to
   Him by the death of His Son. But an absolute God must be in arms
   against us, for even our God is a consuming fire. It is only when we
   behold the Lord Jehovah in the Person of Jesus Christ that our hope and
   joy can begin! When we see Deity Incarnate, when we see God
   surrendering the glories of His Throne to become Man and then stooping
   to the shameful death of the Cross--it is then that we perceive
   Emmanuel, "God with us," and perceiving Him, we feel that He is on our
   side.

   Question yourself then, Soul, whether you are in Christ. He who is not
   with Christ is not with God. If you are without Christ, you are without
   God and a stranger from the commonwealth of Israel. But if through the
   sprinkled blood you can say that you are reconciled unto God, then take
   the full meaning of this text and feast upon it and be blessed, for "If
   God is for us, who can be against us?" We shall handle the text thus
   and may the Holy Spirit make it profitable--how is God for us?
   Secondly, who are against us? And thirdly, who are not against us?

   I. First, HOW IS GOD FOR US? Augustine, in his notes upon the verses
   preceding our text has very beautifully said that God is for us
   according to the preceding words of the chapter in four senses. Look
   back a verse or two and you will find it. He is for us, for He has
   predestinated us. He is for us for He has called us. He is for us for
   He has justified us. He is for us because He has virtually glorified us
   and will actually do so. To the people of God here are four very
   prolific subjects of thought.

   1. God is for us, because, according to the words of the Apostle He has
   predestinated His people to be conformed to the image of His own dear
   Son. Now, if God has predestinated us to eternal life, who can be
   against us? Must not the predestinating decree of God take effect? If
   God has determined it, who shall disannul it? If God has said it shall
   be, who is he that shall stay His hand, or resist the Omnipotent fiat
   of the Most High? He said, "Let there be light: and there was light."
   He bade the world spring out of nothing and forth it came. All things
   obey Him. Heaven adores Him. Hell trembles at Him. No creature can
   resist Him.

   As the potter molds the clay according to his own will while it
   revolves upon the wheel, even so the Infinite, the Omnipotent Jehovah
   does according to His good pleasure in the armies of Heaven and among
   the inhabitants of this lower world. "It is He that sits upon the
   circle of the earth and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers."
   He takes up the isles as a very little thing. Who then, out of these
   little things, can stand against or resist Him?

   See, my Brethren, the force of God's decree of old in the case of
   Israel. The Lord had promised to Abraham that his seed should inherit
   the whole land of Canaan, from the river of Egypt unto the great river,
   the river Euphrates. See, amid the smoke of the brick kilns Israel
   toils in Egypt. How was God's decree to be fulfilled? When God makes
   bare His arm, you shall see and wonder! Pharaoh and all his hosts
   cannot hold those captives whom God determines to set free!

   There they go, led forth like sheep by the hands of Moses and Aaron.
   They cross the desert until they come to the sea, even to the Red Sea.
   See, the mighty stream rolls before them and their ferocious enemies
   are behind but the Lord has determined that they shall inherit the land
   and therefore neither can the sea refuse to divide, nor can Pharaoh
   save himself when he goes down into the depths thereof. They are in the
   wilderness--famine shall destroy them! No, the heavens drop with manna!
   Thirst shall scorch them! No, the Rock follows them with its living
   stream! The serpents shall surely bite them! Yes, but the brazen
   serpent is lifted up and whoever looks shall be healed! The Amalekites
   attack them, but while Moses holds up his hands Joshua puts the foe to
   the route.

   They come to the banks of the Jordan--what ailed you, O Jordan, that
   you were driven back? The priests go through dry-shod and all the
   people of God march after them. Then the Canaanites, with their
   chariots of iron, came against them in battle. The kings of mighty
   cities anointed the shield and laid hold on sword and buckler. But
   which of them prevailed? Did not Jehovah destroy them all? As He had
   given them Og, king of Bashan, "because His mercy endured forever," and
   Sihon, king of the Amorites, "because His mercy endured forever," so
   not a man could stand against them until they possessed the land!

   The right hand of the Lord fulfilled His own decree. His own right hand
   and His holy arm have gotten Him the victory. As with a rod of iron He
   dashes His enemies in pieces like a potter's vessel. None could
   withstand the hosts of Israel! The walled cities were cast down and the
   people of God dwelt in the fat of the land. See, Beloved, the result of
   God's decree! The sons of Jacob were feeble and weak but the Lord made
   them strong enough to drive out the Anakim who were men of gigantic
   stature--for His purpose shall stand--He will do all His pleasure. Let
   us beware of fighting against one who has God in league with him! It is
   in vain to fight against God!

   It was a good remark of the soothsayers to Haman of old. They said, "If
   Mordecai is of the seed of the Jews, before whom you have begun to
   fall, you shall not prevail against him but shall surely fall before
   him." And so if any man is of the company of the elect--if he is one of
   those whose names are written in the Book of Life--his enemies may
   contend but they shall never prevail against him! He must stand whom
   the Lord ordains to hold. And if God determines his salvation, neither
   mortal nor infernal power shall prevail to destroy him.

   On this account we may boldly say with the Apostle, "If God is for us,
   who can be against us?" You cannot believe in a disappointed God--you
   cannot imagine the imperial decree from the Throne of Heaven treated as
   waste paper. It would be far from us so to blaspheme God as to think
   that any power, known or unknown, can ever overcome Him! "Has He said
   and shall He not do it? Has He commanded and shall it not come to
   pass?" If your soul is written upon the palms of Jesus' hands and
   engraved on His heart, no weapon which is formed against you shall
   prosper and every tongue which rises against you in judgment, you shall
   condemn!

   2. But in looking back you observe the second thing--God is on our side
   for He has called us. In the Word of God much stress is laid upon
   calling. When Abraham left the land of his forefathers and went forth,
   not knowing where he went, he was quite safe, though in the midst of
   implacable enemies, because God had called him. "Who raised up the
   righteous man from the east, called him to his feet, gave the nations
   before him and made him rule over kings?" Who but the God that called
   him?

   On that memorable occasion, when Abraham returned from the slaughter of
   the kings, you remember Melchizedek met him. At that time Abraham was
   in great peril for there was every probability that the defeated kings
   would gather their troops, would form alliances with other kings and
   would certainly come up to cut down so insignificant a person as that
   wandering shepherd, Abraham. But what does God say to him--"Fear not,
   Abraham, I am your shield and your exceedingly great reward." This
   became his comfort--God had called him. He was a called man and where
   God calls, He will not desert His chosen.

   "The gifts and calling of God are without repentance." He does not
   reverse the call which He has given, but having once called His
   children He remains faithful to the call He has given. To use the
   illustration we have used before, when God called His son out of Egypt,
   when He fetched Israel from the furnace who could stand against the
   called Israelites? Plague after plague ravaged the land. The cattle
   died. The crops were blasted. Frogs came up into the king's chamber!
   Lice covered all their borders--at last the first-born of Egypt died
   and they besought Israel to go forth--for when God called them out, who
   could hold them in? When He said to His prisoners, "Go forth," what
   bolts of iron, or what gates of brass could keep them captives? Let the
   Lord call by the effectual voice--who is he that shall stand against
   Him?

   Many of us, I trust, have heard the sacred call--we have made our
   calling and election sure. You know how you were called from darkness
   to light--from sin to holiness--from self-righteousness to spiritual
   faith in Jesus. Now, He who has called you is faithful and He will not
   forsake the work of His own hands. He has not called you in order to
   put you to shame! He has not quickened you and preserved you and
   brought you thus far to deliver you over to the hands of your enemies!
   "Be of good courage and He shall strengthen your heart." Wait upon the
   Lord for His call will give you comfort. "If God is for us, who can be
   against us?"

   3. But again--God proves that He is for us by having justified us. All
   the people of God are wrapped about with the righteousness of Christ.
   And wearing that glorious robe, the eyes of God see no fault in
   them--Jehovah sees no sin in Jacob, neither iniquity in Israel. Christ
   is seen and not the sinner! Christ being therefore perfection's own
   self, the Believer is seen as perfect in Him. God regards His people
   with the same affection as that wherewith He loves His only-begotten
   Son!

   He has pronounced them clean and clean they are. He has proclaimed them
   just, covered with the righteousness of Christ and just they are. Come
   on you accusing devil--come on you who lay a thousand things to our
   charge--if our Jesus pronounces our acquittal, who is he that condemns?
   If He mounts the chariot of salvation, who is he that can be against
   us? Is it not a mysteriously blessed thing to wear upon one's soul the
   mark of complete justification? The heathen have a custom of marking
   themselves upon the forehead with the seal of their God. But, oh, what
   a seal is this to wear-- what a mark of the Lord Jesus--to go about
   this world a perfectly justified man!

   God looks upon common men with anger--they are not reconciled unto Him.
   But towards His people He looks always with eyes of love--no anger is
   in His heart to them--not a jot of wrath. All this has been put away
   through the great Sacrifice. Towards them His whole heart goes
   out--"The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and His ears are open
   to their cry." Being justified, they have peace with God through Jesus
   Christ their Lord. O dear Friends, if God is at peace with you, it
   matters not who is at war with you!

   If your Master acquits, it little matters who condemns. If Jehovah
   absolves, it mattes not if your name is cast out as evil! It matters
   not if you are ranked among the vilest of the vile--if your name is a
   byword and a proverb only fit to be worked up into the drunkard's
   song--for who is he that can be against you? What are all these things
   if put into the balance but lighter than vanity, if Jehovah Himself has
   justified you?

   4. And yet again, another sweet reflection comes here--He has also
   glorified us! Remember the four golden links of the chain--"Whom He did
   predestinate, them He also called: and whom He called, them He also
   justified: and whom He justified, them He also glorified." Now, in one
   sense God's people are glorified even now for He "has raised us up
   together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus."

   Mark, it does not say, "He has promised that we shall sit there," but
   He "has" made us sit there! We do sit there at this hour for Christ is
   the Representative of every soul for whom He shed His blood! And when
   Christ took His seat in Heaven every elect soul took his seat in Heaven
   representatively. Remember, Beloved, that the glorification of God's
   people is a certain fact. It is not a thing which may be, but it is a
   thing which must be. What does Jesus Christ say to His people when He
   gathers them at His right hand? "Come, you blessed of My Father,
   inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world."

   Observe that. Do you think God has prepared a kingdom and that He will
   not bring His people there? Moreover it is said, "Prepared for
   you"--for you--the chosen people of God. And do you imagine that the
   Covenant wisdom of God would prepare a kingdom for men who would not
   ultimately get there? Would He plan and arrange how to make them
   eternally blessed and yet allow them to perish by the way? "Prepared
   for you," remember, "from the foundation of the world."

   There is a crown in Heaven which no head can fit but mine. There is a
   harp there which no fingers must ever touch but mine! Child of God
   there is a mansion in Heaven which will never be rightly tenanted if
   you do not get there! And there is a place at God's right hand which
   must be empty--it will be said, "David's seat was empty," unless you
   shall arrive there! Will it be so? Will there be empty mansions in
   Heaven? Will there be crowns without heads to wear them? Will there be
   harps without hands to strike them?

   No! The muster roll of the redeemed shall be read and not one shall be
   found absent! As many as were written upon the breastplate of the great
   High Priest shall be securely found there--

   "Not death nor Hell shall ever divide His chosen from His breast.
   In the dear bosom of His lo ve They must forever rest." This gives a
   fourth reason why God is for us.
   But, O my Brethren, though this brings in the context, I cannot--it is
   impossible for any human speech to bring out the depth of the meaning
   of how God is for us! He was for us before the worlds were made--He was
   for us, or else He never would have given His Son. He was for us even
   when He struck the Only-Begotten and laid the whole weight of His wrath
   upon Him! He was for us though He was against Him! He was for us when
   we were ruined in the Fall--He loved us notwithstanding all. He was for
   us when we were against Him and with a high hand were bidding Him
   defiance! He was for us, or else He never would have brought us humbly
   to seek His face.
   He has been for us in many struggles. We have had to fight through
   multitudes of difficulties. We have had temptations from without and
   within--how could we have held on until now if He had not been with us?
   He is for us, let me say, with all the Infinity of His heart, with all
   the Omnipotence of His love! He is for us with all His boundless
   wisdom. Arrayed in all the attributes which make Him God He is for
   us--eternally and immutably for us! He is for us when yon blue skies
   shall be rolled up like a worn out vesture--for us throughout eternity!
   Here, Child of God, is matter enough for thought even though you had
   ages to meditate upon it--God is for you! And if God is for you, who
   can be against you?
   II. In the second place, WHO ARE AGAINST US? The Apostle never meant to
   say that Christians have no enemies for he knew better than that! An
   old Latin writer observes upon this text that the succeeding context
   will show us the enemies we have who are against us. Very briefly let
   us notice that there are four main enemies who conspire against the
   life of the children of God--these are man, the world, the flesh and
   the devil. These always will be against us but who are they?
   1. First, there is man. How man has struggled against man! Man is the
   wolf of mankind. Not the elements in all their fury nor the wild beasts
   of prey in all their cruelty have ever been such terrible enemies to
   man as man has been to his own fellow! When you read the story of the
   Marian persecution in England, you are astounded that ever creatures
   wearing a human form could be so bloodthirsty. Call these Catholics who
   thus persecuted the Protestants? Call them Catholics? Much better call
   them cannibals for they behaved more like savages than Christians in
   their bloody martyrdoms and murders of the saints of God!
   We do not in this age feel the cruelty of man to that extent but this
   is only because the custom of the land will not allow it. There are
   many who dare not strike with the hand who are very busy in laying on
   their tongue--and this not by exposing our errors which they have a
   perfect right to do--but in many cases the children of God are
   misrepresented, slandered, abused, persecuted, ridiculed for Truth's
   sake. We know many instances where other means are resorted to--
   anything to drive the servants of God away from their integrity and
   from their simple following of their Master.
   Well did the Lord Jesus say, "Beware of men." "Behold I send you forth
   as sheep in the midst of wolves. Be you wise as serpents and harmless
   as doves." Do not expect men to be the friends of your piety, or if
   they are, suspect the reality of that piety of which ungodly man is a
   friend. You must expect to be sometimes bullied and sometimes
   coerced--to be sometimes flattered and threatened.
   You must expect at one time to meet with the oily tongue which has
   under it the drawn sword and at another time with the drawn sword
   itself. Look out and expect that men will be against you. But what are
   they all? Suppose every living man in the world were against you and
   that you had to stand in solitude like Athanasius? You might say, as
   Athana-sius did, "I, Athanasius, against the whole world! I know I have
   Truth on my side and therefore against the world I stand."

   Of what use was the malice of men against Martin Luther? They thought
   to burn him, but he died in his bed despite them all. They thought to
   put an end to him, but his little tracts went everywhere and the words
   of Luther seemed to be carried on the wings of angels until in the most
   distant places the Pope found an enemy suddenly springing up where he
   thought the good seed had all been destroyed. I do not know that it is
   of any great service to have numbers with you. I question whether Truth
   has not generally to be with the minority and whether it is not quite
   as honorable to serve God with two or three as it would be with two or
   three millions.

   If numbers could make a thing right, idolatry ought to be the right
   religion and if in countries across the sea numbers made the thing
   right, why, those who fear the Lord would be few, indeed, and idolatry
   and Romanism would be the right thing! Never judge according to
   numbers--say they are nothing but men after all. If they are good men
   fight on their side. But if they and the Truth of God fall out, fall
   out with Truth! Be a friend to the Truth--make your appeal to the Law
   and to the Testimony--and if they speak not according to this Word it
   is because there is no light in them. And if there is no light in them
   do not trust your soul with them--for if the blind leads the blind,
   they shall both fall into the ditch.

   Who then, what then, are men? Only puppets moved by God's hand. He has
   the string to pull them all which way He wills and if they will not
   serve Him He can soon put them quietly into the grave. Therefore be not
   afraid of the son of man who is but a worm, a little heap of dust! Be
   not dismayed by him. And if he puts on a black and terrific face, look
   him in the face with your own truthfulness and put him to the blush.
   That was grand of Latimer when he preached before Henry VIII. He had
   greatly displeased His Majesty by his boldness in a sermon preached
   before the king and was ordered to preach again on the following Sunday
   and to make an apology for the offense he had given.

   After reading his text, the bishop thus began his sermon--"Hugh
   Latimer, do you know before whom you are this day to speak? To the high
   and mighty monarch, the king's most excellent majesty, who can take
   away your life if you offend. Therefore, take heed that you speak not a
   word that may displease. But then consider well, Hugh, do you not know
   from where you I? Upon whose message you are sent? Even by the great
   and mighty God who is All-Present, and who beholds all your ways and
   who is able to cast your soul into Hell! Therefore, take care that you
   deliver your message faithfully."

   He then proceeded with the same sermon he had preached the preceding
   Sunday, but with considerably more energy! Such courage should all
   God's children show when they have to do with man. You are yourself
   nothing but a worm! But if God puts His Truth into you, do not play the
   coward or stammer out His message, but stand up manfully for God and
   for His Truth!

   Some people are forever crying up what they call a becoming modesty.
   Modesty is very becoming but an ambassador of God must recollect there
   are other virtues besides modesty. If Her Majesty sent an ambassador to
   a country with whom we were at war and the little man should step into
   the conference and say, "I humbly hope you will excuse my being here. I
   wish to be in all things complacent to your honors and lordships the
   ambassadors. I feel I am a young man and you are much older than I am
   and therefore I cheerfully submit my judgment to your superior wisdom
   and experience," and so on. Why I am sure Her Majesty would command him
   back again and then command him into a long retirement!

   What business has he to humble himself when he is an ambassador for the
   Queen! He must remember he is clothed with the dignity of the power
   which sent him. And even so is God's minister and he counts it foul
   shame to stoop to any man! He takes for his motto, Cedo nulli, "I yield
   to none," and preaching God's Truth in love and honesty, he hopes to be
   able to render a fair account to his Master at last--for only unto his
   Master does he stand or fall!

   2. The second adversary is the world. This world is like a great field
   covered with brambles and thorns and thistles and as the Christian goes
   through it he is continually in danger of tearing his garments or
   cutting his feet. Yet--

   "The dear path to our abode, Lies through this barren land."

   Every citizen of Heaven must be taught with thorns and briars, as were
   the men of Succoth. Every child of God must march through the enemies'
   land, for Christ says, "I pray not that You should take them out of the
   world, but that You should keep them from the Evil One."

   When is a Christian out of danger? Never. If he is prosperous, then he
   is apt to grow purse-proud or carnally secure. If adversities press
   upon him, then he is apt to murmur and to grow unbelieving. There are
   temptations in the high places of the earth and the valleys are not
   without them. When the Christian is in honor he is in great peril. Ah,
   how many have found the high places to be slippery ones? When the
   Believer is in shame and disrepute, he is in danger, too, for many
   professors have found this cross too heavy for their shoulders. A
   Believer ought to walk through this world expecting to meet with an
   enemy behind every hedge, reckoning it a wonder if he shall escape for
   a single day without a bullet from the foe!

   You are in an enemy's country and this enemy is on the alert
   continually. You may sleep, but the world never sleeps! Its customs are
   always seeking to bind you with their chains. Its spirit is creeping
   over you while you are in the Exchange, or in the market, or even in
   the family! You will find the very atmosphere of this world tends to
   make you sleep as do others. You will have much ado while you are in
   this state of temptation to stand your ground and unless you watch and
   pray the world will be too much for you.

   O Brethren, I would that we knew the world to be more our enemy than we
   do, for many walk as if they were friends with this world! But such is
   not the Christian's position--he can say, "The world is crucified unto
   me and I unto the world." Luther used to say there was no love lost
   between him and the world, for the world hated him and he hated it no
   less. There is a memorable story told of a good old minister when some
   young minister went weeping to him because he had been slandered. "Ah,"
   said he, "that is a trouble I shall never have again, for I lost my
   character the first year of my ministry and Slander herself can say no
   more than she has said."

   God's servants must expect to lose their characters, to have every
   virtue denied them and every vice imputed to them. But under all this
   they can face the world and say to it, "You think badly of me, do you?
   Not so badly as I think of you! You throw this and that in my teeth--I
   throw worse things in yours. And whereas you say I am a noisy busybody
   and a meddler, I will tell you I purpose to be wilder still and to be
   noisier still against you and to meddle yet more with your vanities
   which ruin the souls of men."

   The world is a terrible assailant if we are left alone in the conflict,
   but what is the world, after all, if God is for us? As for this present
   age, where will it be in forty years? I see a long line of turf mounds
   and many a, "Here he lies"! And this generation is all gone, it passes
   away in the fashion thereof. It is like a candle-snuff and he that
   cares for it is like a man worshipping a dying taper. Care little for
   this world, but think much of the world to come! This poor
   quicksand--get off of it lest it swallow you up! But yonder Rock of
   Ages--build on it and you shall never suffer loss!

   3. I think we said there is a third enemy and that is the flesh. It is
   the worst of the three. We should never need to fear man nor the world
   if we had not this wicked flesh to carry about with us. Inbred
   corruption is the worst corruption. "Lord," said Augustine, "deliver me
   from my worst enemy, that wicked man myself." If a Christian could lay
   himself down and run away from himself and never see himself again he
   would be delighted beyond measure, for, "truly in me, that is in my
   flesh, dwells no good thing," is the experience not of the Apostle
   only, but of every child of God!

   When you would do good, evil is present with you. You want to flee, but
   like the hawk which has a chain to her leg you can but stretch your
   wings and flutter--you cannot mount aloft. You long to feel your heart
   as hot as an oven, but there is a mountain of ice within you which
   chills your flaming desires. To will is present with you--oh, if you
   could be what you would be! But how to perform that which is good you
   find not by reason of the infirmity and weakness of your nature and the
   depravity you have inherited from your parents.

   Some of you have an irritable temper. It will be your plague until you
   die. Others find that though you desire to be liberal to the cause of
   God, yet a covetous disposition has to be struggled with. Some have to
   fight against levity, others against pride. And, on the other hand
   there are some of us whose daily burden is to fight against despondency
   and low-ness of spirits--so that we have all some besetting sin. But if
   God is for us, what matters the flesh? Ah, poor Flesh! You may kick and
   struggle as you will, but when God holds His silver scepter over you,
   you shall surely yield! When Jehovah decrees that a man shall be
   sanctified, that man's flesh may cry and groan but the furnace shall
   refine him. The Holy Spirit shall purify him and experience shall teach
   him and the blood of Christ shall perfect him. Despite that wicked
   heart of ours, we shall on eagles' wings ascend and be found without
   fault before the Throne of God!

   4. The last enemy is the devil. I do not know whether he is worse than
   the flesh or not, but I think I may put him down as being about on a
   par with it. For when the devil meets our flesh, the two shake hands
   and say, "How do you do, Brother?" Truly the two are brothers--for our
   flesh was originally in the family of wrath.

   Ah, that arch-traitor Satan! Little do we know what temptations he is
   plotting and planning for us even now. He is so crafty that he
   understands human nature better than human nature understands itself.
   He has been playing the trade of a tempter for six thousand years! He
   ought to be a thorough master of the business. And certainly he is. He
   who made us knows more of us than Satan does--but, next to God--Satan
   is the best student of humanity.

   He knows our weak points, too. He understands where to touch us so as
   to touch our bone and our flesh. He knows how to cover up the hook with
   the bait--for every soul he has his lure and for every sinner he has
   his trap. He knows how to take one this way and the other the
   opposite--some by straining after pretended spirituality and others by
   descending into the grossest sensuality. Depend on it, my Brothers and
   Sisters, you may think yourself to be safe against Satan but there is a
   joint in your harness and he will find it. And remember, as one leak
   may sink a ship, so one weak point may be and would be your ruin if God
   did not prevent it! But what matters the devil when we have this
   text--"If God is for us, who can be against us?"

   The devil is mighty, but God is Almighty! Satan is strong, but all
   strength belongs to God! What is Satan, after all, but an enemy who has
   had his head broken? He is a broken-headed dragon. The Lord has a hook
   in his nose and a bridle in his jaws and He knows how to pull him back.
   Sometimes I wish He would take him up a link or two, that he might not
   be so busy among some of our Churches. But he is a chained enemy--the
   Lord lets him go just so far--but never any further. Oh, if the Fiend
   could get just a little further, what havoc he would work!

   You know how it was with Job--Satan dared not touch his flesh at
   first--he could only touch his children and cattle. He had to get
   permission to touch his flesh and even then he dared not touch his
   life. He went as far as his tether and vexed poor Job with sore
   troubles--but he could not go any further--for God restrained him.
   Rejoice, Christian, whether it is man, or the world, or your flesh, or
   Satan--if God has predestinated you, called you, justified you and in
   the Person of Jesus Christ glorified you--you may put the whole
   together and then say, "Who can be against us?" As chaff is driven
   away, so, O Lord, have You driven them away."

   III. We shall close our meditation this morning--God make it profitable
   to His own people--by observing WHO ARE THOSE WHO ARE NOT AGAINST US.
   There are some who cannot be our enemies. Here is a very pleasing part
   of the subject. God the Father cannot be against us. He is our Father!
   He cannot be against His own children! He has chosen us--He will not
   cast us away--He has adopted us into His family, He will never discard
   us. He has been pleased to ordain us unto eternal life, He will never
   reverse the decree.

   He was for us in the Covenant of Grace when He planned the way to save
   rebellious man. He has been for us in the great ordering of
   Providence--all things have worked together for good for us until now.
   We wonder how we have arrived where we now are--but surely Providence,
   under God, has worked wondrously on our behalf! He is for us in all the
   decrees which are yet to be fulfilled. There is not a single line in
   the great Book which is against the Christian. You may rest assured
   that whether the earth shall rock and reel, or the moon is black as a
   sackcloth of hair, or the earth is licked up with tongues of fire,
   still Jehovah has not a single thought, nor wish, nor word, nor look
   against any one of the blood-bought ones. They are all safe in Him! God
   the Father cannot be against us.

   Then God the Son is not against us. O Beloved, how sweetly He has been
   for us! I think I see Him now, lifting up that face all covered with
   bloody sweat and saying to every Believer, "I am for you. These gouts
   of gore fall to the dust for you. I sweat great drops of blood that I
   might redeem you." He stands before Pilate. And when He is brought
   forth with the "Ecce homo," I think I hear Him say, "Poor Sinner, I am
   for you." I see Him carrying the Cross upon His bleeding shoulders and
   every step He takes is to this tune, "I am for you."

   I behold Him bleeding upon the Cross with outstretched hands and all
   His wounds and all the drops of blood which flow from His side, all
   say, "Christ is for you." Today, as He pleads before the Eternal
   Throne, this is the tenor of His plea, "I am for you." When He shall
   come a second time without a sin offering, unto salvation, the sound of
   the mighty trumpet which shall herald His advent will ring out, "Christ
   is for you, O you blood-bought saints." When He shall sit upon the
   Throne of His Father and His kingdom shall come--of which there shall
   be no end--this shall be the tenor of that kingdom, "I am for My
   people. I will rule My people righteously and bless the nations upon
   earth."

   Christ cannot be against you. You cannot look into that dear face of
   His and think that He will ever leave you. Your Husband is married to
   you and He has proved His love by such indisputable tokens that you
   must not, oh, you cannot doubt it! Child of God, I almost defy you to
   doubt the love of your Lord Jesus Christ. How can He put you away?
   Could He have bought you at such a price--could He have suffered so
   much for you and yet leave you--throw you away upon the dunghill?
   Impossible! Impossible! Those wounds forever seal your everlasting
   security!

   Then the Holy Spirit cannot be against us. He must always, as the
   Comforter, comfort His own people. As the Illuminator He must lead us
   into the Truth of God. As the great Giver of Life He must always
   quicken us from our death of sin. Whatever power the Holy Spirit has it
   is all engaged for us! "I am with you always, even unto the end of the
   world." Then the holy angels--these cannot be against us. Before Elisha
   opened his servant's eyes, the servant had cried, "Alas,

   Master, what shall we do?" when he saw the Syrians and their chariots.
   But now he sees horses of fire and chariots of fire round about Elisha.
   It is so with you! The angels are ministering spirits who minister unto
   the heirs of salvation. They bear you up in their hands lest you dash
   your foot against a stone.

   Millions of spiritual creatures walk this earth both when we wake and
   when we sleep--and when the black angels come to attack us, the good
   angels contend against them and many a heavenly duel is fought where
   none but spirit eyes can see! Many a sacred fight goes on for the
   defense of the saints, even as Michael fought with the dragon for the
   body of Moses. The good angels are all for us and here we may rejoice.
   Then we know the Law of God cannot be against us. It was our enemy once
   through our sins, but it is now satisfied. Christ has made it
   honorable. It has not a word to say against any soul that is justified
   in Christ.

   The Justice of God has not a word to say against the Christian! On the
   contrary, Justice is well content to confirm the saving decree, "For,"
   says Justice, "that sinner owes me nothing--Christ has discharged his
   debts. I will not put that sinner in prison--I have no right to do so,
   for Christ was imprisoned instead of him. I will not lay my whip upon
   his shoulders for Christ suffered with His much-plowed shoulders in the
   place of that poor believing soul." So, Christian, whoever may be
   against you, here is a comfort--God the Father, God the Son and God the
   Holy Spirit never can be against you! Nor the angels of Heaven, the Law
   and Justice of God--they must always be for you. And if it is so, who
   can be against you?

   Two remarks and then I have done. One is there is an opposite to all
   this, and it belongs to some who are present here this morning. If God
   is AGAINST you, who can be for you? If you are an enemy to God this
   morning, your very blessings are curses to you! Your pleasures are only
   the prelude to your pains. Remember, Sinner, that whether you have
   adversity or prosperity, so long as God is against you, you can never
   truly prosper. If you spread yourself like a green bay tree it is only
   that you may be ready for the axe! You may be fattened with wealth but
   you are only prepared as the bullock for the slaughter. Take these
   words home, I pray you, and let them ring in your ears--"If God is
   against me"--just that supposition! A supposition which is fact because
   you have not believed in Christ--you have not given your heart to God.
   "If God is against me!"

   Will you just think this over on your road home? Take half-an-hour this
   afternoon to think it over. "If God is against me, what then? What will
   become of me in time and eternity? If God is against me, how shall I
   die--how shall I rise again? How shall I face Him in the Day of
   Judgment if God is against me?" It is not an impossible "if," but an
   "if which amounts to a certainty, I fear, in the case of many who are
   sitting in this house today.

   Then, Christian, here is another thought and I have done. If God is for
   you, do you not see how you ought to be for God? If God has espoused
   your cause, ought you not to espouse His? I pleaded with you last
   Sunday since Christ has pleaded the causes of your soul to plead the
   cause of Christ. There is a great battle which has only just began! The
   trumpet which musters the warriors sounds loud and long and the fight
   will be stern and desperate between Christ's pure Truth and the
   ceremonials of the world's Church.

   You must take your post, every one of you, on one side or the other.
   "If the Lord is God, follow Him--but if Baal, then follow him." One
   side or the other you must be on and I beg you, if God has been for you
   and defended you, stand up for Him! Never deny a jot of Christ's Truth.
   Not a hair of the head of Christ's Truth must ever be suffered to be
   touched with the smell of the fire of compromise. Be not as the harlots
   were who stood before Solomon. You remember one was quite content to
   have half the living child. But be your motto, "All or none--I will
   never take a particle of error. Death to it all!" No amalgamation, no
   compromise, no peace with error!

   The men of this generation cry to me and say, "Is there peace?" and my
   answer is, "What peace can there be so long as the sins of Jezebel are
   so many?" Then they revile me and say, "Are you he that troubles
   Israel?" I have not troubled Israel, but you and your father's house,
   in that you have forsaken the Commandments of the Lord and you have
   followed Baal."

   Stand up and bear witness against regeneration by Baptism and against
   those who use Popish words and would have us believe that it is right
   to attach another sense to them! Take your part with Christ and His
   despised people and when the day comes when He shall distribute His
   rewards, happy shall that man be who never flinched. And blessed shall
   he be and shall she be who stood fast in the evil day and stood still
   in the integrity of the Lord and in the firmness of His Truth, firm
   even to the end! The Lord bless you in this thing for Christ's sake.
   Amen.

                Children Brought to Christ, and Not to the Font

   A Sermon

   (No. 581)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, July 24th, 1864, by the

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and
   his disciples rebuked those that brought them. But when Jesus saw it,
   he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children
   to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of
   God. Verily I say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of
   God as a little child, he shall not enter therein. And he took them up
   in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them"--Mark 10:13-16.

   MY attention has been specially directed to this passage by the fact
   that it has been quoted against me by most of the authors of those
   sermons and letters which are, by a stretch of imagination, called
   "replies" to my sermon upon "Baptismal Regeneration." Replies they
   certainly are not, except to one another. I marvel that a Church so
   learned as the Anglican, cannot produce something a little more worthy
   of the point in hand. The various authors may possibly have read my
   discourse, but by reason of mental absorption in other meditations, or
   perhaps through the natural disturbance of mind caused by guilty
   consciences, they have talked with confusion of words, and have only
   been successful in refuting themselves, and answering one another. They
   must have been aiming at something far removed from my sermon, or else
   I must give them credit for being the worst shots that ever practiced
   with polemical artillery. They do not so much as touch the target in
   its extreme corners, much less in its centre. The whole question is, Do
   you believe that baptism regenerates? If so--prove that your belief is
   Scriptural! Do you believe that baptism does not regenerate? Then
   justify your swearing that it does? Who will reply to this? He shall
   merit and bear the palm.

   The Scripture before us is by several of the champions on the other
   side exhibited to the people as a rebuke to me. Their reasoning is
   rather ingenious than forcible: forsooth, because the disciples
   incurred the displeasure of Jesus Christ by keeping back the little
   children from coming to Him, therefore Jesus Christ is greatly
   displeased with me, and with all others like me, for keeping children
   from the font, and the performance there enacted; and specially
   displeased with me for exposing the Anglican doctrine of Baptismal
   Regeneration! Observe the reasoning--because Jesus was much displeased
   with disciples for hindering parents from seeking a blessing upon their
   children, therefore he is much displeased with us who do not believe in
   godfathers and godmothers, or the signing of the cross on the infant
   brow. I must say at the outset that this is rather a leap of argument,
   and would not ordinarily be thought conclusive, but this we may readily
   overlook, since we have long ceased to hope for reasonable arguments
   from those who support a cause based upon absurdity. My brethren, I
   concluded that there must be something forcible in such a text as this,
   or my opponents would not be so eager to secure it; I have therefore
   carefully looked at it, and as I have viewed it, it has opened up to me
   with a sacred splendour of grace. In this incident the very heart of
   Christ is published to poor sinners, and we may clearly perceive the
   freeness and the fulness of the mighty grace of the Redeemer of men,
   who is willing to receive the youngest child as well as the oldest man;
   and is greatly displeased with any who would keep back seeking souls
   from coming to him, or loving hearts from bringing others to receive
   his blessing.

   I. In handling this text in what I believe to be its true light, I
   shall commence, first of all, by observing that THIS TEXT HAS NOT THE
   SHADOW OF THE SHADE OF THE GHOST OF A CONNECTION WITH BAPTISM. There is
   no line of connection so substantial as a spider's web between this
   incident and baptism, or at least my imagination is not vivid enough to
   conceive one. This I will prove to you, if you will follow me for a
   moment.

   It is very clear, Dear Friends, that these young children were not
   brought to Jesus Christ by their friends to be baptized. "They brought
   young children to him, that he should touch them," says Mark. Matthew
   describes the children as being brought "that he would put his hands on
   them and pray," but there is not a hint about their being baptized; no
   godfathers or godmothers had been provided, and no sign of the cross
   was requested. Surely the parents themselves knew tolerably well what
   it was they desired, and they would not have expressed themselves so
   dubiously as to ask him to touch them, when they meant that he should
   baptize them. The parents evidently had no thought of regeneration by
   baptism, and brought the children for quite another end.

   In the next place, if they brought the children to Jesus Christ to be
   baptized, they brought them to the wrong person; for the Evangelist,
   John, in the fourth chapter, and the second verse, expressly assures us
   that Jesus Christ baptized not, but his disciples: this settles the
   question once for all, and proves beyond all dispute that there is no
   connection between this incident and baptism.

   But you will say, "Perhaps they brought the children to be baptized by
   the disciples?" Brethren, the disciples were not in the habit of
   baptizing infants, and this is clear from the case in hand. If they had
   been in the habit of baptizing infants, would they have rebuked the
   parents for bringing them? If it had been a customary thing for parents
   to bring children with such an object, would the disciples who had been
   in the constant habit of performing the ceremony, have rebuked them for
   attending to it? Would any Church clergyman rebuke parents for bringing
   their children to be baptized? If he did so, he would act absurdly
   contrary to his own views and practice; and we cannot therefore imagine
   that if infant baptism had been the accepted practice, the disciples
   could have acted so absurdly as to rebuke the parents for bringing
   their little ones. It is obvious that such could not have been the
   practice of the disciples who were rebuked.

   Moreover, and here is an argument which seems to me to have great force
   in it, when Jesus Christ rebuked his disciples, then was the time if
   ever in his life, to have openly spoken concerning infant baptism,
   godfathers and godmothers, and the whole affair. If he wished to rebuke
   his disciples most effectually, how could he have done it better than
   by saying, "Wherefore keep ye these children back? I have ordained that
   they shall be baptized; I have expressly commanded that they shall be
   regenerated and made members of my body in baptism; how dare you then,
   in opposition to my will, keep them back?" But no, dear friends, our
   Saviour never said a word about "the laver of regeneration," or, "the
   quickening dew," when he rebuked them--not a single sentence. Had he
   done so, the season would have been most appropriate if it had been his
   intention to teach the practice; in the whole of his life, there is no
   period in which a discourse upon infant regeneration in baptism could
   have been more appropriate than on this occasion, and yet not a single
   sentence about it comes from the Saviour's lips.

   To close all, Jesus Christ did not baptize the children. Our Evangelist
   does not inform us that he exclaimed, "Where are the godfathers and
   godmothers?" Is it not recorded that he called for a font, or a Prayer
   Book? No; but "He took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them,
   and blessed them," and dismissed them without a drop of the purifying
   element. Now, if this event had any connection with baptism whatever,
   it was the most appropriate occasion for infant baptism to have been
   practiced. Why, it would have ended for ever the controversy. There may
   be some men in the world who would have raised the question of
   engrafting infants into the body of Christ's Church by baptism after
   all this, but I am certain no honest man would have done so who
   reverently accepted Christ as his spiritual leader. I, my brethren,
   would sooner be dumb than speak a single word against an ordinance
   which Christ himself instituted and practiced; and if on this occasion
   he had but sprinkled one of these infants, given him a Christian name,
   signed him with a cross, accepted the vows of his godparents, and
   thanked God for his regeneration, then the question would have been
   settled for ever, and some of us would have been saved a world of
   abuse, besides escaping no end of mistakes, for which we are condemned,
   in the judgment of many good people, for whom we have some affection,
   though for their judgment we have no respect.

   So you see the parents did not ask baptismal regeneration; Christ did
   not personally baptize; the disciples were not in the habit of
   baptizing infants, or else they would not have rebuked the parents;
   Christ did not speak about baptism on the occasion, and he did not
   baptize the little ones.

   I will put a case to you which may exhibit the weakness of my
   opponents' position. Suppose a denomination should rise up which should
   teach that babes should be allowed to partake at the Lord's Table. Such
   teaching could plead precedents of great antiquity, for you are aware
   that at one period, infant communion was allowed, and logically too;
   for if an infant has a right to baptism, it has a right to come to the
   Lord's Table. For years children were brought to the Lord's Table, but
   rather inconvenient accidents occurred, and therefore the thing was
   dropped as being unseemly. But if someone should revive the error, and
   try to prove that infants are to come to the Lord's Supper, he might
   prove it from this passage quite as clearly as our friends can prove
   infant baptism from it. Moreover do not forget that even if infant
   baptism could be proved from this text, the ceremony prescribed in the
   Prayer Book is quite as far from being established. Whether the baptism
   of infants may or may not be proved from other Scriptures I cannot now
   stay to enquire, but even if it can be, what are we to say for
   godfathers or godmothers, or the assertion that in baptism children are
   made "members of Christ, children of God, and inheritors of the kingdom
   of heaven?" Truly I might as well prove vaccination from the text
   before me, as the performance which the Prayer Book calls "infant
   baptism." I do not hesitate to say that I could prove any earthly
   thing, if I might but have such reasoning granted to me as that which
   proved infant baptism from this passage. There is no possible
   connection between the two. The teaching of the passage is very plain
   and very clear, and baptism has been imported into it, and not found in
   it. As a quaint writer has well said, "These doctrines are raised from
   the text as our collectors raise a tax upon indigent, nonsolvent
   people, by coming armed with the law and a constable to distrain for
   that which is not to be had. Certainly never was text so strained and
   distrained to pay what it never owed; never man so racked to confess
   what he never thought; never was a pumice stone so squeezed for water
   which it never held." Still hundreds will catch at this straw, and cry,
   "Did not Jesus say, Suffer the little children to come unto me?'" To
   these we give this one word, see that ye read the Word as it is
   written, and you will find no water in it but Jesus only. Are the water
   and Christ the same thing? Is bringing a child to a font bringing the
   child to Christ? Nay, here is a wide difference, as wide as between
   Rome and Jerusalem, as wide as between Anti-christ and Christ, between
   false doctrine and the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.

   II. Now, for our second and much more pleasing task, WHY THEN WAS JESUS
   CHRIST DISPLEASED?

   Read the passage and at once the answer comes to you. He was displeased
   with his disciples for two reasons: first, because they discouraged
   those who would bring others to him; and secondly, because they
   discouraged those who themselves were anxious to come to him. They did
   not discourage those who were coming to a font, they discouraged those
   who were coming to Jesus. There is a mighty distinction ever to be held
   between the font and Christ, between the sprinkling of the priest and
   living faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.

   First, his disciples discouraged those who would bring others to him.
   This is a great sin, and wherever it is committed Jesus Christ is
   greatly displeased, for a true desire to see others saved is wrought in
   the believer by God the Holy Spirit, who thus renders the called ones
   the means of bringing wandering sheep into the fold. In this case they
   discouraged those who would bring children to him to be blessed. How
   can we bring children to Jesus Christ to be blessed? We cannot do it in
   a corporeal sense, for Jesus is not here, "he is risen;" but we can
   bring our children in a true, real, and spiritual sense. We take them
   up in the arms of our prayer. I hope many of us, so soon as our
   children saw the light, if not before, presented them to God with this
   anxious prayer, that they might sooner die than live to disgrace their
   father's God. We only desired children that we might in them live over
   again another life of service to God; and when we looked into their
   young faces, we never asked wealth for them, nor fame, nor anything
   else, but that they might be dear unto God, and that their names might
   be written in the Lamb's Book of Life. We did then bring our children
   to Christ as far as we could do it, by presenting them before God, by
   earnest prayer on their behalf. And have we ceased to bring them to
   Christ? Nay, I hope we seldom bow the knee without praying for our
   children. Our daily cry is, "O, that they might live before thee!" God
   knows that nothing would give us more joy than to see evidence of their
   conversion; our souls would almost leap out of our bodies with joy, if
   we should but know that they were the children of the living God. Nor
   has this privilege been denied to us, for there are some here who can
   rejoice in a converted household. Truly we can say with the apostle
   Paul, "I have no greater joy than this, that my children walk in the
   truth." We continue, therefore, to bring them to Christ by daily,
   constant, earnest prayer on their behalf. So soon as they become of
   years capable of understanding the things of God, we endeavour to bring
   them to Christ by teaching them the truth. Hence our Sabbath-schools,
   hence the use of the Bible and family prayer, and catechizing at home.
   Any person who shall forbid us to pray for our children, will incur
   Christ's high displeasure; and any who shall say, "Do not teach your
   children; they will be converted in God's own time if it be his
   purpose, therefore leave them to run wild in the streets," will
   certainly both "sin against the child" and the Lord Jesus. We might as
   well say, "If that piece of ground is to grow a harvest, it will do so
   if it be God's good pleasure; therefore leave it, and let the weeds
   spring up and cover it; do not endeavour for a moment to kill the
   weeds, or to sow the good seed." Why, such reasoning as this would be
   not only cruel to our children, but grievously displeasing to Christ.
   Parents! I do hope you are all endeavouring to bring your children to
   Christ by teaching them the things of God. Let them not be strangers to
   the plan of salvation. Never let it be said that a child of yours
   reached years in which his conscience could act, and he could judge
   between good and evil, without knowing the doctrine of the atonement,
   without understanding the great substitutionary work of Christ. Set
   before your child life and death, hell and heaven, judgment and mercy,
   his own sin, and Christ's most precious blood; and as you set these
   before him, labour with him, persuade him, as the apostle did his
   congregation, with tears and weeping, to turn unto the Lord; and your
   prayers and supplications shall be heard so that the Spirit of God
   shall bring them to Jesus. How much more like the Scripture will such
   labours be than if you were to sing the following very pretty verse
   which disfigures Roundell Palmer's "Book of Praise!"--

   "Though thy conception was in sin,

   A sacred bathing thou hast had;

   And though thy birth unclean has been,

   A blameless babe thou now art made.

   Sweet baby, then forbear to weep;

   Be still, my dear, sweet baby, sleep."

   I cannot tell you how much I owe to the solemn words of my good mother.
   It was the custom on Sunday evenings, while we were yet little
   children, for her to stay at home with us, and then we sat round the
   table and read verse by verse, and she explained the Scripture to us.
   After that was done, then came the time of pleading; there was a little
   piece of "Alleyn's Alarm," or of Baxter's "Call to the Unconverted,"
   and this was read with pointed observations made to each of us as we
   sat round the table; and the question was asked how long it would be
   before we would think about our state, how long before we would seek
   the Lord. Then came a mother's prayer, and some of the words of a
   mother's prayer we shall never forget, even when our hair is grey. I
   remember on one occasion her praying thus: "Now, Lord, if my children
   go on in their sins, it will not be from ignorance that they perish,
   and my soul must bear a swift witness against them at the day of
   judgment if they lay not hold of Christ." That thought of a mother's
   bearing swift witness against me, pierced my conscience and stirred my
   heart. This pleading with them for God and with God for them is the
   true way to bring children to Christ. Sunday-school teachers! you have
   a high and noble work, press forward in it. In our schools you do not
   try to bring children to the baptistry for regeneration, you point them
   away from ceremonies; if I know the teachers of this school aright, I
   know you are trying to bring your classes to Christ. Let Christ be the
   sum and substance of your teaching in the school. Young men and young
   women, in your classes lift up Christ, lift him up on high; and if
   anybody shall say to you, "Why do you thus talk to the children?" you
   can say, "Because my soul yearns towards them, and I pant for their
   conversion;" and if any should afterwards object, you can remember that
   Jesus is greatly displeased with them, and not with you, for you only
   obey the injunction, "Feed my lambs."

   The case in our text is that of children, but objectors rise up who
   disapprove of endeavours to bring any sort of people to Christ by faith
   and prayer. There are some who spend their nights in the streets
   seeking after the poor harlot, and I have heard many harsh observations
   made about their work; some will say it is ridiculous to expect that
   any of those who have spent their days in debauchery should be
   converted. We are told that the most of those who are taken into the
   refuges go back and become as depraved as ever; I believe that to be a
   very sad and solemn truth; but I believe, if I or anyone else shall
   urge that or anything else as a reason why my brethren should not seek
   the harlot, that Jesus would be greatly displeased; for any man who
   stands between a soul-seeker and the divine object of getting a
   blessing for the sinner's soul, excites the wrath of Christ. Some have
   hopes of our convicts and criminals; but every now and then there is an
   outcry against those who even believe it possible for a transport or a
   ticket-of-leave man to be converted. But Jesus is greatly displeased
   with any who shall say about the work, "It is too hard; it is
   impossible." My brethren in Christ, labour for souls of all sorts: for
   your children and for those who are past the threescore years and ten.
   Seek out the drunkard; go after the thief; despise not the poor
   down-trodden slave; let every race, let every colour, let every age,
   let every profession, let every nation, be the object of your soul's
   prayers. You live in this world, I hope, to bring souls to Jesus; you
   are Christ's magnets with which through his Holy Spirit he will attract
   hearts of steel; you are his heralds, you are to invite wanderers to
   come to the banquet; you are his messengers, you are to compel them to
   come in that his house may be filled; and if the devil tells you you
   will not succeed, and if the world tells you that you are too feeble
   and have not talent enough, never mind, Jesus would be greatly
   displeased with you if you should take any heed to them; and meanwhile
   he is greatly displeased with your adversaries for endeavouring to stop
   you. Beloved, this is why Jesus Christ was greatly displeased.

   A second ground of displeasure must be noticed. These children, it
   strikes me, and I think there is good reason for the belief, themselves
   desired to come to Christ to obtain a blessing. They are called "little
   children," which term does not necessarily involve their being infants
   of six months or a year; indeed, it is clear, as I will show in a
   moment, that they were not such little children as to be unconscious
   babes. They were "infants," according to our version of Luke, but then
   you know the English word "infant" includes a considerable range of
   age, for every person in his minority is legally considered to be an
   infant, though he may be able to talk to any amount. We do not,
   however, desire to translate the text with so great a license. There is
   no necessity in the language used that these should have been anything
   but what they are said to be--"little children." It is evident they
   could walk, because in Luke it is said, "Jesus called them;" the gender
   of the Greek pronoun used there refers it to the children, not to the
   persons, nor to the disciples. Jesus called them, he called the
   children, which he would hardly have done if they could not comprehend
   his call: and he said, "Suffer the little children to come," which
   implies that they could come, and doubtless they did come, with
   cheerful faces, expecting to get the blessing. These perhaps may have
   been some of those very children, who, a short time after, pulled down
   branches from the trees and strewed them in the way, and cried,
   "Hosanna," when the Saviour said, "Out of the mouths of babes and
   sucklings hast thou ordained strength." Now Christ was greatly
   displeased with his disciples for pushing back these boys and girls.
   They did, as some old folks do now-a-days, who cry out--"Stand back,
   you boys and girls! we do not want you here; we do not want children to
   fill up the place; we only want grown-up people." They pushed them
   back; they thought that Christ would have too much to do, if he
   attended to the juveniles. Here comes out this principle, that we must
   expect Christ's displeasure, if we attempt to keep anybody back from
   coming to Christ, even though it be the youngest child. You ask how
   persons can come to Christ now? They cannot come corporeally, but they
   can come by simple prayer and humble faith. Faith is the way to Jesus,
   baptism is not. When Jesus says, "Come unto me all ye that labour and
   are heavy laden," he did not mean, "be baptized," did he? No; and so
   when he said, "Suffer the little children to come unto me," he did not
   mean, "Baptize them," did he? Coming to Jesus Christ is quite a
   different thing from coming to a font. Coming to Christ means laying
   hold upon Christ with the hand of faith; looking to him for my life, my
   pardon, my salvation, my everything. If there be a poor little child
   here who is saying in her little heart, or his little heart, "I would
   like to come to Christ, O that I might be pardoned while I am yet a
   little one"--come, little lamb; come, and welcome. Did I hear your cry?
   Was it this?

   "Gentle Jesus, meek and mild,

   Look upon a little child;

   Pity my simplicity,

   Suffer me to come to thee."

   Dear little one, Jesus will not despise your lispings, nor will his
   servant keep you back. Jesus calls you, come and receive his blessing.
   If any of you say a word to keep the young heart back, Jesus will be
   displeased with you. Now I am afraid some do that; those, for instance,
   who think that the gospel is not for little children. Many of my
   brethren, I am sorry to say, preach in such a way that there is no hope
   of children ever getting any good by their preaching. I cannot glory in
   learning or eloquence, but in this one thing I may rejoice, that there
   is always a number of happy children here, who are quite as attentive
   as any of my audience. I do love to think that the gospel is suitable
   to little children. There are boys and girls in many of our
   Sabbath-school classes down below stairs who are as truly converted to
   God as any of us. Nay, and if you were to speak with them about the
   things of God, though you should get to the knotty points of election
   and predestination, you would find those boys and girls well taught in
   the things of the kingdom: they know free will from free grace, and you
   cannot puzzle them when you come to talk about the work of Jesus and
   the work of the Spirit, for they can discern between things which
   differ. But a minister who preaches as though he never wanted to bring
   children to Christ, and shoots right over the little one's heads, I do
   think Jesus is displeased with him.

   Then there are others who doubt whether children ever will be
   converted. They do not look upon it as a thing likely to happen, and
   whenever they hear of a believing child, they hold up their hands at
   the prodigy, and say, "What a wonder of grace!" It ought to be, and in
   those Churches where the gospel is simply preached, it is as common a
   thing for children to be converted as for grown-up people to be brought
   to Christ. Others begin to doubt the truth of juvenile conversions.
   They say, "They are very young, can they understand the gospel? Is it
   not merely an infantile emotion, a mere profession?" My brethren, you
   have no more right to suspect the sincerity of the young, than to
   mistrust the grey-headed; you ought to receive them with the same
   open-breasted confidence with which you receive others when they
   profess to have found the Saviour. Do, I pray you, whenever you see the
   faintest desire in your children, go down on your knees, as your
   servant does, when the fire is almost out, and blow the spark with your
   own breath--seek by prayer to fan that spark to a flame. Do not despise
   any godly remark the child may make. Do not puff the child up on
   account of the goodness of the remark, lest you make him vain and so
   injure him, but do encourage him; let his first little prayers be
   noticed by you; though you may not like to teach him a form of
   prayer--I shall not care if you do not--yet teach him what prayer is;
   tell him to express his desires in his own words, and when he does so,
   join ye in it and plead with God on his behalf, that your little one
   may speedily find true peace in a Saviour's blood. You must not, unless
   you would displease my Master, keep back the smallest child that longs
   to come to Christ.

   Here let us observe that the principle is of general application; you
   must not hinder any awakened soul from seeking the Saviour. O my
   brethren and sisters, I hope we have such a love for souls, such an
   instinct within us to desire to see the travail of Christ's soul, that
   instead of putting stumbling-blocks in the way, we would do the best we
   could to gather out the stones. On Sabbath days I have laboured to
   clear up the doubts and fears which afflict coming sinners; I have
   entreated God the Holy Spirit to enable me so to speak, that those
   things which hindered you from coming to the Saviour might be removed;
   but how sad must be the case of those who delight themselves in putting
   stumbling-blocks in men's way. The doctrine of election for instance, a
   great and glorious truth, full of comfort to God's people; how often is
   that made to frighten sinners from Jesus! There is a way of preaching
   that with a drawn sword, and say, "You must not come unless you know
   you are one of God's elect." That is not the way to preach the
   doctrine. The true way of preaching it is, "God has a chosen people,
   and I hope you are one of them; come, lay hold on Jesus, put your trust
   in him." Then there be others who preach up frames and feelings as a
   preparation for Christ. They do in effect say, "Unless you have felt so
   much depression of spirit, or experienced a certain quantity of
   brokenness of heart, you must not come to Christ," instead of
   declaring, that whosoever will is permitted to come, and that the true
   way of coming to Christ is not with a qualification of frames and
   feeling and mental depressions, but just as you are. Oh! it is my
   soul's delight to preach a gospel which has an open door to it, to
   preach a mercy-seat which has no veil before it; the veil is rent in
   twain, and now the biggest sinner out of hell who desires to come, is
   welcome. You who are eighty years of age, and have hated Christ all the
   time, if now the Spirit of God makes you willing to come, Christ seems
   to say, "Suffer the grey- headed to come unto me, and forbid them not:"
   while to you little children, he stretches out his arms in the same
   manner, "Suffer the little children to come unto me." O my beloved, see
   to it that your heart longs to come to Christ, and not to ceremonies! I
   stand here this day to cry, "Come ye to the cross, not to the font."
   When I forget to lift up the Lord Jesus, and to cast down the forms of
   man's devising, "let my right hand forget her cunning," and "let my
   tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth"--

   None but Jesus, none but Jesus,

   Can do helpless sinners good;"

   The font is a mockery and an imposition if it be put before Christ. If
   you have baptism after you have come to Christ, well and good, but to
   point you to it either as being Christ, or as being inevitably
   connected with Christ, or as being the place to find Christ, is nothing
   better than to go back to the beggarly elements of the old Romish
   harlot, instead of standing in the "liberty wherewith Christ hath made
   us free," and bidding the sinner to come as a sinner to Christ Jesus,
   and to Christ Jesus alone.

   III. In the third and last place, let us also gather from our text,
   that WHEN WE DISCOURAGE ANY, WE ALWAYS GO UPON WRONG GROUNDS. Here was
   the case of children. I suppose that the grounds upon which the
   apostles kept back the children would be one of these--either that the
   children could not receive a blessing, or else that they could not
   receive it worthily.

   Did they imagine that these little children could not receive the
   blessing? Perhaps so, for they thought them too young. Now, brethren,
   that was a wrong ground to go upon, for these children could receive
   the blessing and they did receive it, for Jesus took them in his arms
   and blessed them. If I keep back a child from coming to Christ on the
   ground that he is too young, I do it in the face of facts; because
   there have been children brought to Christ at an extremely early
   period. You who are acquainted with Janeway's "Tokens for Children,"
   have noticed very many beautiful instances of early conversion. Our
   dear friend, Mrs. Rogers, in that book of hers, "The Folded Lamb," gave
   a very sweet picture of a little son of hers, soon folded in the
   Saviour's bosom above, who, as early as two or three years of age,
   rejoiced and knew the Saviour. I do not doubt at all, I cannot doubt
   it, because one has seen such cases, that children of two or three
   years of age may have precocity of knowledge, and of grace; a
   forwardness which in almost every case has betokened early death, but
   which has been perfectly marvellous to those who have talked with them.
   The fact is that we do not all at the same age arrive at that degree of
   mental stature which is necessary for understanding the things of God.
   Children have been reported as reading Latin, Greek, and other
   languages, at five or six years of age. I do not know that such early
   scholarship is any great blessing, it is better not to reach that point
   so soon; but some children are all that their minds ever will be at
   three or four, and then they go home to heaven; and so long as the mind
   has been brought up to such a condition that it is capable of
   understanding, it is also capable of faith, if the Holy Spirit shall
   implant it. To suppose that he ever did give faith to an unconscious
   babe is ridiculous; that there can be any faith in a child that knows
   nothing whatever I must always take ground to doubt, for "How shall
   they believe without a preacher?" And yet they are brought up to make a
   profession in their long-clothes, when they have never heard a sermon
   in their lives. But those dear children to whom I have before referred,
   have understood the preacher, have understood the truth, have rejoiced
   in the truth, and their first young lispings have been as full of grace
   as those glorious expressions of aged saints in their triumphant
   departures. Children are capable, then, of receiving the grace of God.
   Do mark by the way, that all those champions who have come out against
   me so valiantly, have made a mistake; they have said that we deny that
   little infants may be regenerated; we do not deny that God can
   regenerate them if he pleases; we do not know anything about what may
   or may not happen to unconscious babes; but we did say that little
   children were not regenerated by their godparents telling lies at a
   font--we did say that, and we say it again, that little children are
   not regenerated, nor made members of Christ, nor children of God, nor
   inheritors of the kingdom of heaven, by solemn mockery, in which
   godfathers and godmothers promise to do for them what they cannot do
   for themselves, much less for their children. That is the point; and if
   they will please to meet it, we will answer them again, but till such
   time as that, we shall probably let them talk on till God gives them
   grace to know better.

   The other ground upon which the apostles put back the children would
   be, that although the children might receive the blessing, they might
   not be able to receive it worthily. The Lord Jesus in effect assures
   them that so far from the way in which a little child enters into the
   kingdom of heaven being exceptional, it is the rule; and the very way
   in which a child enters the kingdom, is the way in which everybody must
   enter it. How does a child enter the kingdom of heaven? Why, its faith
   is very simple; it does not understand mysteries and controversies, but
   it believes what it is told upon the authority of God's Word, and it
   comes to God's Word without previous prejudice. It has its natural
   sinfulness, but grace overcomes it, and the child receives the Word as
   it finds it. You will notice in boyish and girlish conversions, a
   peculiar simplicity of belief: they believe just what Christ says,
   exactly what he says. If they pray, they believe Christ will hear them:
   if they talk about Jesus, it is as of a person near at hand. They do
   not, as we do, get into the making of these things into mysteries and
   shadows, but little children have a realizing power. Then they have
   great rejoicing. The most cheerful Christians we have are young
   believers; and the most cheerful old Christians are those who were
   converted when they were young. Why, see the joy of a child that finds
   a Saviour! "Mother," he says, "I have sought Jesus Christ, and I have
   trusted him, and I am saved." He does not say, "I hope," and "I trust,"
   but "I am;" and then he is ready to leap for joy because he is saved.
   Of the many boys and girls whom we have received into
   Church-fellowship, I can say of them all, they have all gladdened my
   heart, and I have never received any with greater confidence than I
   have these: this I have noticed about them, they have greater joy and
   rejoicing than any others; and I take it, it is because they do not ask
   so many questions as others do, but take Jesus Christ's word as they
   find it, and believe in it. Well now, just the very way in which a
   child receives Christ, is the way in which you must receive Christ if
   you would be saved. You who know so much that you know too much; you
   who have big brains; you who are always thinking, and have tendency to
   criticism, and perhaps to scepticism, you must come and receive the
   gospel as a little child. You will never get a hold of my Lord and
   Master while you are wearing that quizzing cap; no, you must take it
   off, and by the power of the Holy Spirit you must come trusting Jesus,
   simply trusting him, for this is the right way to receive the kingdom.

   But here, let me say, the principle which holds good in little children
   holds good in all other cases as well. Take for instance the case of
   very great sinners, men who have been gross offenders against the laws
   of their country. Some would say they cannot be saved; they can be for
   some of them have been. Others would say they never receive the truth
   as it is in Jesus in the right manner; ay, but they do. How do great
   sinners receive Christ? There are some here who have been reclaimed
   from drunkenness, and I know not what. My brethren, how did you receive
   Christ? Why in this way. You said, "All unholy, all unclean, I am
   nothing else but sin; but if I am saved, it will be grace, grace,
   grace." Why, when you and I stood up, black, and foul, and filthy, and
   yet dared to believe in Christ, we said, "If we are saved, we shall be
   prodigies of divine mercy, and we will sing of his love for ever." Well
   but, my dear friends, you must all receive Jesus Christ in that very
   way. That which would raise an objection to the salvation of the big
   sinner is thrown back upon you, for Christ might well say, "Except ye
   receive these things as the chief of sinners, ye cannot enter the
   kingdom." I will prove my point by the instance of the apostle Paul. He
   has been held by some to be an exception to the rule, but Paul did not
   think so, for he says that God in him showed forth all longsuffering
   for a pattern to them that believe, and made him as it were a type of
   all conversions; so that instead of being an exception his was to be
   the rule. You see what I am driving at. The case of the children looks
   exceptional, but it is not; it has, on the contrary, all the features
   about it which must be found in every true conversion. It is of such
   that the kingdom of heaven is composed, and if we are not such we
   cannot enter it. Let this induce all of us who love the Lord, to pray
   for the conversion both of children and of all sorts of men. Let our
   compassion expand, let us shut out none from the plea of our heart; in
   prayer and in faith let us bring all who come under our range, hoping
   and believing that some of them will be found in the election of grace,
   that some of them will be washed in the Saviour's blood, and that some
   of them will shine as stars in the firmament of God for ever. Let us,
   on no consideration, believe that the salvation of any man or child is
   beyond the range of possibility, for the Lord saveth whom he wills. Let
   no difficulties which seem to surround the case hinder our efforts; let
   us, on the contrary, push with greater eagerness forward, believing
   that where there seems to be some special difficulty, there will be
   manifested, as in the children's case, some special privilege. O labour
   for souls, my dear friends! I beseech you live to win souls. This is
   the best rampart against error, a rampart built of living
   stones--converted men and women. This is the way to push back the
   advances of Popery, by imploring the Lord to work conversions. I do not
   think that mere controversial preaching will do much, though it must be
   used; it is grace-work we want; it is bringing you to Christ, it is
   getting you to lay hold of him--it is this which shall put the devil to
   a nonplus and expand the kingdom of Christ. O that my God would bring
   some of you to Jesus! If he is displeased with those who would keep you
   back, then see how willing he is to receive you. Is there in your soul
   any desire towards him? Come and welcome, sinner, come. Do you feel now
   that you must have Christ or die? Come and have him, he is to be had
   for the asking. Has the Lord taught you your need of Jesus? Ye thirsty
   ones, come and drink; ye hungry ones, come and eat. Yea, this is the
   proclamation of the gospel to-day, "The Spirit and the bride say, Come.
   And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come.
   And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely." I do trust
   there may be encouragement in this to some of you. I pray my Master
   make you feel it. If he be angry with those who keep you back, then he
   must be willing to receive you, glad to receive you; and if you come to
   him he will in no wise cast you out. May the Lord add his blessing on
   these words for Jesus' sake. Amen.

                   The Restoration And Conversion Of The Jews

   PREACHED ON THURSDAY EVENING, JUNE 16, 1864,

   BY THE REV. C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON,
   In aid of the Funds of the British Society for the Propagation of the
   Gospel Among the Jews.

   "The hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the Spirit of
   the Lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of
   bones and caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there
   were very many in the open valley. And, lo, they were very dry. And He
   said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord
   God, You know. Again He said unto me, Prophesy upon these Bones and say
   unto them, O you dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. Thus says the
   Lord God unto these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into
   you and you shall live: and I will lay sinews upon you and will bring
   up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and you
   shall live. And you shall know that I am the Lord. So I prophesied as I
   was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise and behold a
   shaking and the bones came together, bone to his bone. And when I
   beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them and the skin
   covered them above: but there was no breath in them. Then said He unto
   me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, Son of man and say to the wind,
   Thus says the Lord God: Come from the four winds, O Breath and breathe
   upon these slain, that they may live. So I prophesied as He commanded
   me and the breath came into them and they lived and stood up upon their
   feet, an exceeding great army." Ezekiel 37:1-10.

   THIS vision has been used, from the time of Jerome onwards, as a
   description of the resurrection and certainly it may be so accommodated
   with much effect. What a vision of the great day the words picture
   before the mind's eye! The great army of the quick, who once were dead,
   seem to start up as we read. Here, too, we have a very fit and
   appropriate question to be asked in a tomb--"Son of man, can these
   bones live?" Looking down into the dark grave, or watching the sexton
   as he throws up the moldering relics, once infused with life, well may
   unbelief suggest the enquiry--"Can these bones live?"

   Faith cannot at all times give a more satisfactory answer than this--"O
   Lord God, You know." But while this interpretation of the vision may be
   very proper as an accommodation, it must be quite evident to any
   thinking person that this is not the meaning of the passage. There is
   no allusion made by Ezekiel to the resurrection and such a topic would
   have been quite apart from the design of the Prophet's speech. I
   believe he was no more thinking of the resurrection of the dead than of
   the building of St. Peter's at Rome, or the emigration of the Pilgrim
   Fathers! That topic is altogether foreign to the subject at hand and
   could not by any possibility have crept into the Prophet's mind.

   He was talking about the people of Israel and prophesying concerning
   them. And evidently the vision, according to God's own interpretation
   of it, was concerning them and them alone, for, "these bones are the
   whole house of Israel." It was not a vision concerning all men, nor,
   indeed, concerning any men as to the resurrection of the dead--it had a
   direct and special bearing upon the Jewish people. This passage, again,
   has been very frequently and I dare say very properly, used to describe
   the revival of a decayed Church. This vision may be looked upon as
   descriptive of a state of lukewarmness and spiritual lethargy in a
   Church when the question may be sorrowfully asked--"Can these bones
   live?"

   Can that dull minister wake up to living power? Can these cold deacons
   glow with holy heat? Can those unspiritual members rise to something
   like holy, earnest self-sacrifice? Is it possible that the drowsy
   formal Church could start up to real earnestness? Such suggestions
   might well have occurred to many minds at the time of the Reformation.
   It did seem impossible, when Popery was in its power, that spiritual
   life should ever again return to the Church. Piety seemed to be dead
   and buried and the cloister, the clergy, superstition and deceit, like
   great graves, had swallowed up everything that was good.

   But the Lord appeared for His people and brought up the buried Truth of
   God out of its grave, and once more in every part of the known world
   the name of Jesus Christ was lifted up and sound doctrine was preached!
   So was it in our own country. When both the Establishment and

   Dissent had fallen into spiritual death we might well have said--"Can
   these bones live?" But Whitfield and Wesley were raised up by God and
   they prophesied to the dry bones, and up they stood--filled with the
   Spirit of God--"an exceeding great army." Let the crowds of Kingsdown
   and the multitudes on Kennington Common tell of the quickening power of
   Jesus' name! Decayed Churches can most certainly be revived by the
   preaching of the Word accompanied by the coming of the heavenly
   "breath" from the four winds.

   O Lord, send us such revivals now, for many of your Churches need
   them--they are almost as dead as the corpses which sleep around them in
   the graveyard. But while we admit this to be a very fitting
   accommodation of our text, yet we are quite convinced that it is not to
   this that the passage refers. It would be altogether alien to the
   Prophet's strain of thought to be thinking about the restoration of
   fallen zeal and the rekindling of expiring love. He was not considering
   the Reformation either of Luther or of Whitfield, or about the revival
   of one Church or of another. No, he was talking of his own people, of
   his own race and of his own tribe. He surely ought to have known his
   own mind, and led by the Holy Spirit, he gives us as an explanation of
   the vision. Not--"Thus says the Lord, My dying Church shall be
   restored," but--"I will bring My people out of their graves and bring
   them into the land of Israel."

   With very great propriety, too, this passage has been used for the
   comforting of Believers in their dark and cloudy days. When they have
   lost their comforts, when their spiritual joys have drooped like
   withering flowers, when they have been no longer able to--

   "Read their titles clear To mansions in the skies," they have been
   reminded that God could return to them in Grace and mercy, that the dry
   bones could live and should live! Then they remember that the Spirit of
   God could again come upon His people--that even at the time when they
   were ready to give up all hope and lie down in despair, He could come
   and so quicken them, that the poor trembling cowards should be turned
   into soldiers of God and should stand upon their feet an exceeding
   great army!

   No grave of grief can hold the immortal joy of a Believer--on the third
   day it shall rise again, for, like the Lord who gave it, it shall never
   see corruption! Bone to his bone shall your comforts come together and
   an army of joys shall live in your soul. The passage certainly may be
   so used without violent wresting and might thus yield much comfort to
   the people of God. But still we take the liberty of saying that this is
   not the drift of the Prophet and that we do not believe he was thinking
   of anything of the kind. We think that he was speaking only of his own
   people, his own "kinsmen according to the flesh."

   Once more. There is no doubt that we have in this passage a most
   striking picture of the restoration of dead souls to spiritual life.
   Men by nature are just like these dry bones exposed in the open valley.
   The whole spiritual frame is dislocated. The sap and marrow of
   spiritual life has been dried out of manhood. Human nature is not only
   dead, but, like the bleaching bones which have long whitened in the
   sun, it has lost all trace of the Divine life. Will and power have both
   departed. Spiritual death reigns undisturbed. Yet the dry bones can
   live! Under the preaching of the Word the vilest sinners can be
   reclaimed, the most stubborn wills can be subdued, the most unholy
   lives can be sanctified! When the holy "breath" comes from the four
   winds, when the Divine Spirit descends to own the Word, then multitudes
   of sinners as on Pentecost's hallowed day, stand up upon their feet--an
   exceeding great army--to praise the Lord their God.

   But, mark you, this is not the first and proper interpretation of the
   text. It is, indeed, nothing more than a very striking parallel case to
   the one before us. It is not the case itself. It is only a similar one
   for the way in which God restores a nation is, practically, the way in
   which He restores an individual. The way in which Israel shall be saved
   is the same by which any one individual sinner shall be saved. It is
   not, however, the one case which the Prophet is aiming at. He is
   looking at the vast mass of cases--the multitudes of instances to be
   found among the Jewish people of gracious quickening and holy
   resurrection.

   His first and primary intention was to speak of them and though it is
   right and lawful to take a passage in its widest possible meaning
   since, "no Scripture is of private interpretation," yet I hold it to be
   treason to God's Word to neglect its primary meaning and constantly to
   say-- "Such-and-such is the primary meaning, but it is of no
   consequence and I shall use the words for another subject." The
   preacher of God's Truth should not give up the Holy Spirit's meaning!
   He should take care that he does not even put it in the background. The
   first meaning of a text, the Spirit's meaning, is that which should be
   brought out first and though the rest may fairly spring out of it, yet
   the first sense should have the chief place.

   Let it have the uppermost place in the synagogue. Let it be looked upon
   as at least not inferior, either in interest or importance, to any
   other meaning which may come out of the text. The meaning of our text
   as opened up by the context is most evidently, if words mean anything,
   first, that there shall be a political restoration of the Jews to their
   own land and to their own nationality. And then, secondly, there is in
   the text and in the context a most plain declaration that there shall
   be a spiritual restoration-- in fact a conversion--of the tribes of
   Israel.

   I. First, THERE IS TO BE A POLITICAL RESTORATION OF THE JEWS. Israel is
   now blotted out from the map of nations. Her sons are scattered far and
   wide. Her daughters mourn beside all the rivers of the earth. Her
   sacred song is hushed--no king reigns in Jerusalem! She brings forth no
   governors among her tribes. But she is to be restored! She is to be
   restored "as from the dead." When her own sons have given up all hope
   of her, then is God to appear for her. She is to be reorganized--her
   scattered bones are to be brought together. There will be a native
   government again. There will again be the form of a political body.

   A State shall be incorporated and a king shall reign. Israel has now
   become alienated from her own land. Her sons, though they can never
   forget the sacred dust of Palestine, yet die at a hopeless distance
   from her consecrated shores. But it shall not be so forever, for her
   sons shall again rejoice in her--her land shall be called Beulah--for
   as a young man marries a virgin so shall her sons marry her. "I will
   place you in your own land," is God's promise to them. They shall again
   walk upon her mountains, shall once more sit under her vines and
   rejoice under her fig trees!

   And they are also to be reunited. There shall not be two, nor ten, nor
   twelve, but one--one Israel praising one God--serving one king and that
   one King the Son of David, the descended Messiah! They are to have a
   national prosperity which shall make them famous. No, so glorious shall
   they be that Egypt and Tyre and Greece and Rome shall all forget their
   glory in the greater splendor of the throne of David! The day shall yet
   come when all the high hills shall leap with envy because this is the
   hill which God has chosen! The time shall come when Zion's shrine shall
   again be visited by the constant feet of the pilgrim--when her valleys
   shall echo with songs and her hilltops shall drop with wine and oil.

   If there is meaning in words this must be the meaning of this chapter!
   I wish never to learn the art of tearing God's meaning out of His own
   Words. If there is anything clear and plain, the literal sense and
   meaning of this passage--a meaning not to be spirited or spiritualized
   away--it must be evident that both the two and the ten tribes of Israel
   are to be restored to their own land and that a king is to rule over
   them. "Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will take the children of
   Israel from among the heathen where they are gone and will gather them
   on every side and bring them into their own land: and I will make them
   one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel. And one king shall
   be king to them all. And they shall be no more two nations, neither
   shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all."

   I am not now going into millennial theories, or into any speculation as
   to dates. I do not know anything at all about such things and I am not
   sure that I am called to spend my time in such research. I am called to
   minister the Gospel rather than to open prophecy. Those who are wise in
   such things doubtless prize their wisdom, but I have not the time to
   acquire it, nor any inclination to leave soul-winning pursuits for less
   arousing themes. I believe it is a great deal better to leave many of
   these promises and many of these gracious outlooks of Believers to
   exercise their full force upon our minds without depriving them of
   their simple glory by aiming to discover dates and figures. Let this be
   settled, however, that if there is meaning in words, Israel is yet to
   be restored--

   "Yet not in vain--over Israel's land
   The glory yet will shine.
   And He, your once rejected King,
   Messiah, shall be yours.
   His chosen Bride, ordained with Him
   To reign over all the earth,
   Shall first be framed, and you shall know
   Your Savior's matchless worth.
   Then you, beneath the peaceful reign
   Of Jesus and His Bride,
   Shall sound His Grace and Glory forth,
   To all the earth beside.
   The nations to your glorious light,
   O Zion, yet shall throng,
   And all the listening islands wait
   To catch the joyful song."

   But there is a second meaning here. ISRAEL IS TO HAVE A SPIRITUAL
   RESTORATION OR A CONVERSION. Both the text and the context teach this.
   The promise is that they shall renounce their idols and, behold, they
   have already done so! "Neither shall they defile themselves any more
   with their idols." Whatever faults the Jew may have, he certainly has
   not idolatry. "The Lord your God is one God," is a Truth far better
   conceived by the Jew than by any other man on earth except the
   Christian. Weaned forever from the worship of all images of any sort,
   the Jewish nation has now become infatuated with traditions or duped by
   philosophy.

   She is to have, however, instead of these delusions, a spiritual
   religion--she is to love her God. "They shall be My people and I will
   be their God." The unseen but Omnipotent Jehovah is to be worshipped in
   spirit and in truth by His ancient people. They are to come before Him
   in His own appointed way, accepting the Mediator whom their sires
   rejected. They will come into Covenant relation with God, for so our
   text tells us-- "I will make a Covenant of peace with them," and Jesus
   is our peace--therefore we gather that Jehovah shall enter into the
   Covenant of Grace with them--that Covenant of which Christ is the
   federal Head, the Substance and the Surety.

   They are to walk in God's ordinances and statutes and so exhibit the
   practical effects of being united to Christ who has given them peace.
   All these promises certainly imply that the people of Israel are to be
   converted to God and that this conversion is to be permanent. The
   tabernacle of God is to be with them! The Most High is, in a special
   manner, to have His sanctuary in the midst of them forever more so that
   whatever nations may apostatize and turn from the Lord in these latter
   days, the nation of Israel never can, for she shall be effectually and
   permanently converted. The hearts of the fathers shall be turned with
   the hearts of the children unto the Lord their God and they shall be
   the people of God, world without end.

   We look forward, then, for these two things. I am not going to theorize
   upon which of them will come first--whether they shall be restored
   first, and converted afterwards--or converted first and then restored.
   They are to be restored and they are to be converted, too. Let the Lord
   send these blessings in His own order and we shall be well content
   whichever way they shall come. We take this for our joy and our comfort
   that this thing shall be and that both in the spiritual and in the
   temporal throne, the King Messiah shall sit and reign among His people
   gloriously.

   II. Now I come to the practical part of my sermon this evening--THE
   MEANS OF THAT RESTORATION. Looking at this matter we are very apt to
   say, "How can these things be? How can the Jews be converted to Christ?
   How can they be made into a nation? Truly the case is quite as hopeless
   as that of the bones in the valley! How shall they cease from
   worldliness or renounce their constant pursuit of riches? How shall
   they he weaned from their bigoted attachment to their Talmudic
   traditions? How shall they be lifted up out of that hardness of heart
   which makes them hate the Messiah of Nazareth, their Lord and King? How
   can these things be?"

   The Prophet does not say it cannot be. His unbelief is not so great as
   that, but at the same time he scarcely ventures to think that it can
   ever be possible. He very wisely, however, puts back the question upon
   his God--"O Lord God, You know." Now some of you are very expectant
   about this tonight and you are expecting to see the Jews converted very
   soon, perhaps in a month or two. I wish you may see it as soon as your
   desires would date it. Others of us are not as optimistic and take a
   more gloomy view of a long future of woes.

   Well, let us both together come before God tonight and say, "O Lord
   God, You know. And if You know it, Lord, we will be content to leave
   the secret with You! Only tell us what You would have us do. We ask not
   food for speculation, but we do ask for work. We ask for something by
   which we may practically show that we really do love the Jew and that
   we would bring him to Christ."

   In answer to this, the Lord says to His servants, "Prophesy upon these
   bones," so that our duty tonight, as Christians, is to prophesy upon
   these bones and we shall then see God's purpose fulfilled--when we obey
   God's precept. I want you to observe that there are two kinds of
   prophesying spoken of here. First, the Prophet prophesies to the
   bones--here is preaching. And next, he prophesies to the four
   winds--here is praying. The preaching has its share in the work, but it
   is the praying which achieves the result--for after he had prophesied
   to the four winds and not before--the bones began to live.

   All that the preaching did was to make a stir and to bring the bones
   together, but it was the praying which did the work, for then God the
   Holy Spirit came to give them life! Preaching and praying, then, are
   the two heads of this part of my sermon tonight and we will speak upon
   each briefly.

   1. It is the duty and the privilege of the Christian Church to preach
   the Gospel to the Jew and to every creature. And in so doing she may
   safely take the vision before us as her guide. She may take it as her
   guide, first, as to matter. What are we to preach? The text says we are
   to prophesy and assuredly every missionary to the Jews should
   especially keep God's prophecies very prominently before the public
   eye. It seems to me that one way in which the Jewish mind might be laid
   hold of would be to remind the Jews right often of that splendid future
   which both the Old and the New Testaments predict for Israel.

   Every man has a tender side and a warm heart towards his own nation and
   if you tell him that in your standard book there is a revelation made
   that that nation is to act a grand part in human history and is,
   indeed, to take the very highest place in the parliament of
   nations--then the man's prejudice is on your side and he listens to you
   with the greater attention. I would not commend, as some do, the
   everlasting preaching of prophesy in every congregation. But a greater
   prominence should be given to prophecies in teaching the Jews than
   among any other people.

   But still, the main thing which we have to preach about is Christ.
   Depend upon it dear Brethren, the best sermons which we ever preach are
   those which are fullest of Christ Jesus, the Son of David and the Son
   of God! Jesus the suffering Savior by whose stripes we are healed!
   Jesus able to save unto the uttermost--here is the most suitable
   subject for Gentiles. God has fashioned all hearts alike and therefore
   this is also the noblest theme for Jews. Paul loved his countrymen! He
   was no simpleton--he knew what was the best weapon with which to assail
   and overcome their prejudices and yet he could say, "I determined not
   to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and Him crucified."

   Lift up the Messiah, then, both before Jew and Gentile. Tell of Mary's
   Son, the eternal Son of God, the Man of Nazareth who is none other than
   the Incarnate Word, God made flesh and dwelling among us! Preach His
   hallowed life--the righteousness of His people. Declare His painful
   death--the putting away of all their sins. Vindicate His glorious
   Resurrection! The justification of His people. Tell of His ascent on
   high. His triumph over the world and sin! Declare His second advent,
   His glorious coming to make His people glorious in the Glory which He
   has won for them! And Christ Jesus, as He is thus preached, shall
   surely be the means of making these bones live!

   Let this preaching resound with Sovereign mercy! Let it always have in
   it the clear and distinct ring of Free Grace. I was thinking as I read
   this chapter just now, that of all the sermons which were ever
   preached, this sermon to the dry bones is the most Calvinistic, the
   most full of Free Grace of any which were ever delivered. If you will
   notice it you will find that there is not an "if," or a "but," or a
   condition in it!

   And as for free will, there is not even a mention of it. It is all in
   this fashion--"Thus says the Lord God unto these bones: Behold, I will
   cause breath to enter into you and you shall live: and I will lay
   sinews upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with
   skin and put breath in you and you shall live. And you shall know that
   I am the Lord." You see it is all "shalls," and "wills," and Covenant
   purposes. It is all God's decrees declared and declared, too, as if
   there were no possibility of man's resisting them.

   He does not say, "You dry bones, you shall live if you like. You shall
   if you are willing." He does not say to them, "You shall stand upright
   and be an exceeding great army if it pleases you to consent to My
   power." No, but it is, "I will," and, "you shall." As for will, it is
   altogether put out of the question, for how shall the dead have a will
   in the matter? And so, dear Friends, I would have the Gospel preached
   both to the Jew and the Gentile with a very clear and distinct note of
   free, Sovereign, almighty Grace.

   Man has a will and God never ignores that will--but by His almighty
   Grace He blessedly leads it in silken fetters. He never stops to ask
   that will's consent when He comes forth upon His errands of effectual
   Grace. He wins that consent by the sweet persuasions of His own
   Omnipotent love. He comes arrayed in the robes of His Omnipotent Grace
   and the most hardened of rebels see at once such an attractive force in
   the love of God in Christ that with full consent against their ancient
   wills they yield themselves captives to the Grace of God! I do not
   believe that the Jews, or anybody else, will ever be converted as a
   usual thing by keeping back any of the Doctrines of Grace.

   We must have God's Truth and the whole of it. And more distinct
   utterances concerning evangelical doctrines and the Grace of God are
   required both for Jews and for Gentiles. Preach, preach, preach,
   then--but let it be the preaching of Christ and the proclamation of
   Free Grace. The Church, I say, has a model here as to the matter of
   preaching. And I am certain that she has also a model here as to her
   manner of preaching. How shall we preach the Gospel? Was Ezekiel to do
   what some of my hyper-Calvinistic Brethren say preachers ought to
   do--to warn the sinner, but never to invite him?

   Was Ezekiel to go and talk to these bones, but never say a word to them
   by way of command? Was he to explain the way of salvation but never bid
   them walk in it? No! After he had declared Covenant purposes, he was
   then to say, "Thus says the Lord, you dry bones live." And so the
   message of the Gospel minister, when he has declared the purposes of
   Divine Grace, is to say to sinners, "Thus says the Lord, believe in the
   Lord

   Jesus Christ! Trust Christ and you are saved!" Whoever you may be, Jew
   or Gentile. Whether your speech is that of the land of Canaan or of a
   Gentile tongue. Whether you spring of Shem, Ham, or Japheth--trust
   Christ and you are saved! Trust Him, then, you dry bones, and live!
   Withered arm be outstretched! Lame men, leap! Blind eyes, see! You
   dead, dry bones, live!

   The manner of our preaching is to be by way of command as well as by
   way of teaching. Repent and be converted, every one of you. Lay hold on
   eternal life. "Seek and you shall find. Knock and it shall be opened
   unto you." "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved!"
   We have a model here, moreover, as to our audience. We are not to
   select our congregation, but we are to go where God sends us. And if He
   should send us into the open valley where the bones are very dry, we
   are to preach there. I trust that my Brethren of the Society for the
   Propagation of the Gospel Among the Jews will never confine their
   labors to the good Jew, the respectable Jew, the enlightened Jew--let
   them seek after him among the rest--but I hope they will also seek
   after the ignorant, the degraded, the poor and the fallen.

   The Church's best harvests have generally been reaped among the poor.
   For every grain of wheat which has fructified upon the hillsides of
   wealth, thousands have sprung up to bring forth much fruit in the
   valleys of poverty and obscurity. "The poor have the Gospel preached to
   them"--this is the Gospel's pride! The poor receive the Gospel--this is
   its success! Preach to the dry bones, then. Do not say, "Such-and-such
   a man is too bigoted." The case rests not with him, nor with his
   bigotry, but with God! These bones were very dry, but yet they lived.

   There is very little to choose, after all, between one man and another
   when all are dead! A little difference in the dryness does not come to
   much account when all are dead in sin. That some men are drunk and some
   are sober, that some men are debauched and some are chaste makes a very
   great difference in the moral and civil world. But very little
   difference, indeed, in the spiritual world, for there the same things
   happen to them both. If they believe not they shall alike be lost. And
   if they trust Jesus Christ they shall alike be saved! Let not,
   therefore, the greater vi-ciousness of a people, or their greater
   hardness of heart, ever stand in our way--but let us say to them, dry
   as they are--"You dry bones, live."

   And here, again, we have another lesson as to the preacher's authority.
   If you will observe you will see the Prophet says, "Hear the Word of
   the Lord." We are to go neither to Jew nor to Gentile upon our own
   errand, or bearing our own words. I have no right to command a man to
   believe this or that unless I am an ambassador of God. And then, with
   God's authority to direct and empower me, I speak no longer as a man
   following his own wit but as the mouth of God.

   So let every one of us go, when we are trying to save souls, feeling
   the hand of God upon us, with a soul big with anxious thoughts and
   heaving high with earnest desires. Let us speak--

   "As though we never might speak again, As dying men to dying men,"
   taking hold upon God's arm and beseeching Him to work by us and through
   us for the good of men. Remember, Christian, however humble you may
   be--when you speak God's Word--that Word has an authority about it
   which will leave a man without excuse if he rejects it. Always put to
   your fellow man the Truth of God which you hold dear--not as a thing
   which he may play with or may do what he likes with--or which is at his
   option to choose or to neglect as he sees fit. But put it to him as it
   is in truth--the Word of God. And be not satisfied unless you warn him
   that it is at his own peril that he rejects the invitation and that on
   his own head must be his blood if he turns aside from the good Word of
   the command of God.

   Thus, we have, I think, all the directions which are necessary for us
   to preach. And what this Society and every other Society which aims at
   the conversion of sinners has to do is to go and preach, preach,
   preach--not spending too much upon printing, nor upon schools, nor
   ecclesiastical buildings--but preaching the Word of God! For after all,
   this is the battering-ram which is to shake the gates of Hell and break
   its iron bars. God has chosen "the foolishness of preaching" that He
   might, by it, save those who believe! Preaching is the blast of the
   ram's horn ordained to level Jericho and the sound of the silver
   trumpet appointed to usher in the jubilee. It is God's chariot of fire
   for bearing souls to Heaven and His two-edged sword to strike the hosts
   of Hell. His ordained servants are at once warriors and builders, and
   the Word serves them both for spear and trowel. Preach, then, from
   morning till night--at every time and on all occasions, "the
   unsearchable riches of Christ," and Israel shall yet live!

   I cannot leave this point without noticing how the Prophet describes
   the effect of his preaching--there was a voice and there was a noise.
   Was this the noise of God's voice going with man's voice? Or was this
   the noise of the bones themselves creeping over one another? Does this
   represent opposition on the part of those preached to? Truly opposition
   is always a good sign! When you can get a man to oppose you, you may
   have some hope of him. If he has enough religious thought to try and
   refute what you bring before him, you may be thankful. Is this stir,
   then, the stir of opposition, or is it the stir of enquiry?

   Does not the creeping of the bones together represent the people coming
   together to hear, to talk with one another, to reason about Divine
   things? When the various muscles and the flesh come upon the bones,
   does this represent the appearance of certain converts, destined to be
   the leaders of others? Are these sinews and muscles the representatives
   of men who are to move the rest of the corporate body by-and-by? It may
   be so and we may expect to see, as Christ is preached among Jews or
   Gentiles, more and more stir and excitement--the people coming together
   in greater numbers and the whole mass fermenting by the force of the
   leaven. Anything is better than stagnation--of a persecutor I have
   quite as much hope as of a quiet despiser.

   2. But now we come to speak of that in which you can all take a part.
   Perhaps you cannot take a part in preaching the Word, though I wish
   that you all could. And I covet for you all the best gifts. But in the
   second form of prophesying you can all take your share. After the
   Prophet had prophesied to the bones, he was to prophesy to the winds.
   He was to say to the blessed Spirit, the Life-Giver, the God of all
   Grace, "Come from the four winds, O Breath and breathe upon these
   slain, that they may live."

   Preaching alone does little. It may make a stir. It may bring the
   people together. There is an attractiveness about the Gospel which will
   draw the people to hear it. And there is, moreover, a force about it
   which will excite them, for it is "quick and powerful and sharper than
   any two-edged sword." But there is no life-giving power in the Gospel
   of itself apart from the Holy Spirit! The "Breath" must first blow and
   then these bones shall live! Let us betake ourselves much to this form
   of prophesying.

   Brothers and Sisters in Christ, you who care for Israel, go before the
   Lord now and from now on in earnest, importunate prayer! Strive to be
   more than ever conscious of the utter indispensability of this matter.
   Feel that without Christ you can do nothing! In vain your society, your
   machinery, your committees, your secretaries, your collectors, your
   contributors, your missionaries without the Holy Spirit! Blow your
   trumpet and proclaim loudly what you have done--you have sown much--but
   you shall reap little unless you are trusting in the Spirit of God!
   There is always this danger to which we are exposed, though some, I
   know, think that it is a danger which does not exist--I mean the peril
   of looking to the strength or the weakness of the instrumentality and
   being either puffed up by the one or dejected by the other.

   You are enough for your work if God is with you! And if you are but a
   handful you are too many for your work if God is not with you. God
   never objects to human weakness--when He comes to work He prefers
   it--for it makes a platform for Divine power. What did He say to
   Gideon--"The people are too many for Me." He did not say that they were
   too few. You never find a case in Scripture of God's saying that the
   people were too few--it was, "The people are too many for Me." Man's
   strength is more in God's way than man's weakness. No, human weakness,
   inasmuch as it makes elbow room for God's strength, is God's chosen
   instrument! "Therefore will I glory in infirmities," said the Apostle,
   "that the power of God may rest upon me." Rest then, upon the Holy
   Spirit as indispensable and go to God with this for your cry, "Come
   from the four winds, O Breath and breathe upon these slain, that they
   may live."

   Observe, Beloved, that this second prophesying of Ezekiel is just as
   bold and as full of faith as the first. He seems to have no doubt, but
   speaks as though he could command the wind. "Come," says he and the
   wind comes. We need more faith in God. When we are engaged in any
   spiritual work we shall always find our success proportioned to our
   faith. Little faith, slender harvests! Much faith, plenteous sheaves!
   Little fishes come in slender numbers to Little-Faith's net. But
   Strong-Confidence can hardly hold all the great fishes which load her
   boat. I will not ask for your society, or for you any further gift than
   greater faith, for, getting greater faith you have Divine strength and
   sure success.

   The Spirit always works with faithful men. My dear Friends, the Spirit
   of God is poured out! He abides in His Church as the ever-present
   Comforter. We are not to look upon His influences as a gift which we
   cannot reach for He is here waiting to give us all we need. He dwells
   in the midst of His people and we have but to cry unto Him and He will
   manifest His mighty power and we shall have souls saved, both Jews and
   Gentiles! Let your prayer, then, be with a sense of how much you need
   it, but yet with a firm conviction that the Holy Spirit will most
   surely come in answer to your petitions.

   And then let it be earnest prayer. That, "Come from the four winds, O
   breath," reads to me like the cry, not of one in despair, but of one
   who is full of a vehement desire gratified with what he sees, since the
   bones have come together and have been mysteriously clothed with flesh!
   And he is now crying passionately for the immediate completion of the
   miracle--"Come from the four winds, O Breath and breathe upon these
   slain, that they may live." There is continual vehemence and force
   here--here is just that which makes a prayer prevalent. O, let us cry
   mightily unto God! We cannot expect to see great things unless we cry
   to Him--but we are only limited by our prayers. We are not straitened
   in Him! We are only straitened in ourselves.

   We might see greater things if we could but believe. All things are
   possible to him that believes, but as of old, the Lord Jesus cannot do
   many mighty things nowadays because of our unbelief. We hamper the arm
   of Grace! We do, as it were, restrain the Almighty energy. O for
   greater faith to believe that nations may be born in a day! That
   multitudes may be turned unto God at once--and we shall yet see it--see
   what our fathers never saw and what our imaginations have never
   dreamed! We shall leap from victory to victory, marching on from one
   triumph to another until we meet the all-glorious Savior! Charging
   enemy after enemy and routing army after army, we shall go on,
   conquering and to conquer until we salute Him who comes upon the white
   horse of triumph followed by all the armies of Heaven! Brethren, be of
   good courage in your work of faith and labor of love for it is not and
   shall not be in vain in the Lord.

   I address some tonight, I know, who have no interest in what I have
   been saying for they are not subjects of Messiah, themselves. Remember,
   faith is a sign of your allegiance to Him. Trust Christ and you are
   saved! Trust Jesus Christ and you are delivered from Divine wrath and
   from the power of your natural passions. The Lord grant you a
   resurrection tonight, O you who are dead in sin, and His name shall
   have all the praise!

   Our friends here have for some little time been in a small way
   assisting this Society by their contributions. They, therefore, are
   well acquainted with it. I have not time this evening to enter into
   details about it, but I may just say that this Society has for a long
   time done a good work among the Jewish people. And I ask you to
   contribute to this among other good works as you feel moved to do
   whenever opportunity occurs.

                              The Lamb--The Light

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JULY 31, 1864, BY THE REV. C. H. SPURGEON,
   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in
   it: for the Gory of God did lighten it and the Lamb is its light."
   Revelation 21:23.

   To the lover of Jesus it is very pleasant to observe how the Lord Jesus
   Christ has always stood foremost in Glory from before the foundation of
   the world and will do so as long as eternity shall last. If we look
   back by faith to the time of the creation, we find our Lord with His
   Father as one brought up with Him. "When there were no depths, I was
   brought forth, when there were no fountains abounding with water. While
   as yet He had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part
   of the dust of the world. When He prepared the heavens, I was there:
   when He set a compass upon the face of the depth: when He established
   the clouds above: when He strengthened the fountains of the deep."

   He was that Wisdom who was never absent from the Father's counsels in
   the great work of creation, whether it was the birth of angels or the
   making of worlds of men. One of the first events ever recorded in
   Scripture history is, "When He brings in the First-Begotten into the
   world, He says, let all the angels of God worship Him." Such words were
   never spoken of any creature, but only of Him who is co-equal and
   co-eternal with the Father. He is glorious forever--the First-Born of
   every creature, the Head of the household of God--the express Image of
   His Person and the fullness of His Glory.

   In the earliest periods of which we possess any knowledge, Jesus Christ
   stood exalted far above all principalities and powers and every name
   that is named. When human history dawns and the history of God's Church
   commences, you still find Christ preeminent. All the types of the early
   Church are only to be opened up by Him as the key. It would have been
   nothing to be of the seed of Israel if it had not been for the promise
   of the Shiloh that was to come! It would have been in vain that the
   sacrifices were offered in the wilderness, that the ark abode between
   the curtains, or that the golden pot which had the manna was covered
   with the Mercy Seat if there had not been a real signification of
   Christ in all these. The religion of the Jew would have been very
   emptiness if it had not been for Christ who is the Substance of the
   former shadows.

   Run on to the period of the Prophets and in all their prophesying do
   you not see additional glimpses of the Glory of Christ? When they mount
   to the greatest heights of eloquence do they not speak of Him? Whenever
   their soul is carried up, as in a chariot of fire, is not the mantle
   left behind them a word telling of the Glory of Jesus? They could never
   glow with fervent heat except concerning Him. Even when they denounced
   the judgments of God, they paused between the crashes of God's thunder
   to let some drops of mercy fall on man in words of promise concerning
   Him who was to come. It is always Christ from the opening leaf of
   Genesis to the closing note of Malachi--Christ, Christ, Christ--and
   nothing but Christ!

   It is very delightful, Brethren, when we come to such a text as this,
   to observe that what was in the beginning is now and ever shall be,
   world without end, Amen. In that millennial state of which the text
   speaks, Jesus Christ is to be the light and all its Glory is to proceed
   from Him. And if the text speaks concerning Heaven and the blessedness
   hereafter, all its light and blessings and Glory stream from Him--"The
   Lamb is its light." If we read the text and think of its connection
   with us today we must confess that all our joy and peace flow from the
   same fountain! Jesus Christ is the Sun of Righteousness to us as well
   as to the saints above.

   I shall try, then--though I am conscious of my feebleness to handle so
   great a matter--I shall try as best I can to extol the Lord Jesus,
   first of all, in the excellence of His Glory in the millennial state.
   Next, in Heaven. And then, thirdly, in the condition of every
   heavenly-minded man who is on his way to Paradise--in all these cases,
   "the Lamb is its light."

   I. First, then, a few words concerning THE MILLENNIAL PERIOD. We are
   not given to prophesying in this place. There are some of our Brethren
   who delight much in that. Perhaps it is well that there should be some
   who should devote their time and thoughts to that portion of God's Word
   which abounds in mysteries. But for our part we have been so engaged in
   seeking to win souls and in endeavoring to contend with the common
   errors of the day that we have scarcely ventured to land upon the rock
   of Patmos, or to peer into the dark recesses of Daniel and Ezekiel.

   Yet this much we have ever learned most clearly--that on this earth,
   where sin and Satan gained victory over God through the fall of
   man--Christ is to achieve a complete triumph over all His foes! Not on
   another battlefield, but on this. The fight is not over. It commenced
   by Satan's attack upon our mother Eve and Christ has never left the
   field from that day until now. The fight has lasted thousands of years.
   It grows sterner every day. It is not over. And it never shall be over
   until the serpent's head is effectually bruised and Christ Jesus shall
   have gotten unto Himself a perfect victory.

   Do not think the Lord will allow Satan to have even so much as one
   battle to call his own. In the great campaign, when the history shall
   be written, it shall be said, "The Lord reigns." All along the line He
   has gotten the victory. There shall be victory in every place and spot.
   And the conquest of Jesus shall be complete and perfect. We believe,
   then, that in this very earth where superstition has set up its idols,
   Jesus Christ shall be adored! Here, where blasphemy has defiled human
   lips, songs of praise shall rise from islands of the sea and from the
   dwellers among the rocks!

   In this very country, among those very men who became the tools of
   Satan and whose dwelling places were dens of mischief--there shall be
   found instruments of righteousness--and lips to praise God and
   occasions of eternal Glory unto the Most High. O Satan, you may boast
   of what you have done and you may think your scepter still secure, but
   He comes, even He who rides upon the white horse of victory! And when
   He comes you shall not stand against Him, for the two-edged sword which
   goes out of His mouth shall drive you and your hosts back to the place
   from where you came. Let us rejoice that Scripture is so clear and so
   explicit upon this great doctrine of the future triumph of Christ over
   the whole world!

   We are not bound to enter into any particulars concerning what form
   that triumph shall assume. We believe that the Jews will be converted
   and that they will be restored to their own land. We believe that
   Jerusalem will be the central metropolis of Christ's kingdom. We also
   believe that all the nations shall walk in the light of the glorious
   city which shall be built at Jerusalem. We expect that the Glory which
   shall have its center there shall spread over the whole world--
   covering it as with a sea of holiness, happiness and delight! For this
   we look with joyful expectation.

   During that period the Lord Himself, by His glorious Presence, shall
   set aside the outward rites of His sanctuary. "The city has no need of
   the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it." Perhaps sun and moon
   here are intended those ordinary means of enlightenment which the
   Church now needs. We need the Lords' Supper to remind us of the body
   and blood of Christ. But when Christ comes there will be no Lord's
   Suppers, for it is written, "Do this until He comes." But when He
   comes, then will be the final period of the remembrance-token because
   the Person of Christ will be in our midst.

   Neither will you need ministers any longer any more than men need
   candles when the sun rises. They shall not say one to another, "Know
   the Lord: for all shall know Him, from the least to the greatest."
   There may be even in that period certain solemn assemblies and Sundays
   but they will not be of the same kind as we have now--for the whole
   earth will be a temple and every day will be a Sunday! The avocations
   of men will all be priestly--they shall be a nation of
   priests--distinctly so and they shall, day without night, serve God in
   His temple. Everything to which they set their hand shall be a part of
   the song which shall go up to the Most High.

   Oh, blessed day! Would God it had dawned, when these temples should be
   left, because the whole world should be a temple for God. But whatever
   may be the splendors of that day--and truly here is a temptation to let
   our imagination revel--however bright may be the walls set with
   chalcedony and amethyst, however splendid the gates which are of one
   pearl--whatever may be the magnificence set forth by the "streets of
   gold," this we know--that the sum and substance, the light and Glory of
   the whole will be the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ, "for the Glory
   of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is its light."

   Now I want the Christian to meditate over this. In the highest, holiest
   and happiest era that shall ever dawn upon this poor earth, Christ is
   to be her light! When she puts on her wedding garment and adorns
   herself as a bride is adorned with jewels, Christ is to be her Glory
   and her beauty! There shall be no earrings in her ears made with other
   gold than that which comes from His mine of love. There shall be no
   crown set upon her brow fashioned by any other hand than His hands of
   wisdom and of Grace. She sits to reign, but it shall be upon His
   Throne. She feeds, but it shall be upon His bread. She triumphs, but it
   shall be because of the might which ever belongs to Him who is the Rock
   of Ages! Come then, Christian, contemplate for a moment your beloved
   Lord!

   Jesus, in a millennial age, shall be the light and the Glory of the
   city of the new Jerusalem. Observe then, that Jesus makes the light of
   the millennium because His Presence will be that which distinguishes
   that age from the present. That age is to be akin to Paradise. Paradise
   God first made upon earth and Paradise God will last make. Satan
   destroyed it. And God will never have defeated His enemy until He has
   reestablished Paradise--until once again a new Eden shall bless the
   eyes of God's creatures! Now the very Glory and privilege of Eden I
   take to be not the river which flowed through it with its four
   branches, nor that it came from the land of Havilah which has dust of
   gold. I do not think the Glory of Eden lay in its grassy walks, or in
   the boughs bending with luscious fruit.

   I think its glory lay in this--that the "Lord God walked in the garden
   in the cool of the day." Here was Adam's highest privilege--that he had
   companionship with the Most High! In those days angels sweetly sang
   that the tabernacle of God was with man and that He did dwell among
   them. Brethren, the Paradise which is to be regained for us will have
   this for its essential and distinguishing mark--that the Lord shall
   dwell among us! This is the name by which the city is to be
   called--Jehovah Shammah--the Lord is there. It is true we have the
   Presence of Christ in the Church now--"Lo, I am with you always, even
   unto the end of the world." We have the promise of His constant
   indwelling--"Where two or three are gathered together in My name, there
   am I in the midst of them."

   But still that is vicariously by His Spirit. Soon He is to be
   personally with us. That very Man who once died upon Calvary is to live
   here! He--that same Jesus--who was taken up from us shall come in like
   manner as He was taken up from the gazers of Galilee. Rejoice, rejoice,
   Beloved, that He comes, actually and really comes! And this shall be
   the joy of that age--that He is among His saints and dwells in them,
   with them, and talks and walks in their midst. The Presence of Christ
   it is which will be the means of the peace of the age. In that sense
   Christ will be the light of it, for He is our peace. It will be through
   His Presence that the lion shall eat straw like an ox, that the leopard
   shall lie down with the kid.

   It will not be because men have had more enlightenment and have learned
   better through advancing civilization, that they shall beat their
   swords into plowshares. It is notorious that the more civilized nations
   become, the more terrible are their instruments of destruction. And
   when they do go to war, the more bloody and protracted their wars
   become. I venture to say that if in a thousand years' time Christ shall
   not come, if war were to break out, where we now fight for ten or
   twenty years we shall have the venomous hatred of one another and the
   means of carrying on a war for a century!

   Instead of advancing in peacefulness, I do fear the world has gone
   back. We certainly cannot boast now of living in calm days of peace.
   But Christ's Presence shall change the hearts of men. Then
   spontaneously, at sight of the great Prince of Peace, they shall cast
   away their armor and their weapons of war and shall learn war no more.
   In that sense, then, because His Presence will be the cause of that
   happy period, He is the light of it.

   Again, Christ's Presence is to that period its special instruction.
   They shall need no candle, neither light of the sun, nor of the moon.
   Why? Because Christ's Presence will be sufficiently instructive to the
   sons of men. When the Lord Jesus Christ comes, superstition will not
   need an earnest testimony to confute it--it will hide its head.
   Idolatry will not need the missionary to preach against it--the idols
   He shall utterly abolish and shall cast them to the moles and to the
   bats. Men and women, at the sight of Christ, and at the knowledge that
   He is reigning gloriously upon earth, will give up their unbelief.

   The Jew will recognize the Son of David and the Gentile will rejoice to
   worship Him who was once slain as the King of the Jews. The Presence of
   Christ shall do more for the enlightenment of His Church than the
   teaching of all her officers and ministers in all ages. She shall then,
   in the sight of her Lord, come to a fullness of knowledge and have a
   perfect understanding of God's Word. Once again, Christ will be the
   light of that period in the sense of being its Glory. Oh, it is the
   glory of the Christian now to think that Christ reigns in Heaven! In
   this we boost in every season of depression and when we are
   downcast--that He is exalted and sits at the right hand of the Father!

   But the glory of that age shall be that Christ is come, that He sits
   upon the throne of David as well as upon the Throne of God--that His
   enemies bow before Him and lick the dust. Think, my Brethren, of the
   splendor of that time when from every nation and land they shall bring
   Him tribute! When praises shall ascend from every land! When the
   streets of that city shall be thronged every day with adoring
   worshippers! When He shall ride forth conquering and to conquer and His
   saints shall follow Him upon white horses!

   We sometimes have high days and holidays when kings and princes go
   abroad and the streets are full and people crowd even to the chimney
   pots to see them as they ride along. But what shall it be to see King
   Jesus crowned with the crown which His mother crowned Him in the day of
   His espousals? What a contrast between the cavalcade winding its way
   along the streets of Jerusalem, along the Via Dolorosa up to the mount
   of execution--what a contrast, I say! Then women followed Him and wept,
   but now men will follow Him and shout for joy! Then He carried His
   Cross, but now He shall ride in state! Then His enemies mocked Him and
   gloated their eyes with His sufferings--now His enemies shall be put to
   confusion and covered with shame! And upon Himself shall His crown
   flourish! Then it was the hour of darkness and the time of the Prince
   of the Pit, but now it shall be the day of light and the victory of
   Emmanuel and the sounding of His praise both on earth and in Heaven!

   Contemplate this thought. And though I speak of it so feebly, yet it
   may ravish your hearts with transport that Christ is the Sun of that
   long-expected, that blessed day! Christ shall be the highest mountain
   of all the hills of joy, the widest river of all the streams of
   delight! Whatever there may be of magnificence and of triumph, Christ
   shall be the center and soul of it all! Oh, to be present and to see
   Him in His own light--the King of kings and Lord of lords!

   II. And now we will turn our thoughts another way from the millennial
   period to THE STATE OF THE GLORIFIED IN HEAVEN ITSELF. "The city has no
   need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it." The inhabitants
   of the better world are independent of creature comforts. Let us think
   that over for a minute. We have no reason to believe that they daily
   pray, "Give us this day our daily bread." Their bodies shall dwell in
   perpetual youth. They shall have no need of raiment. Their white robes
   shall never wear out, neither shall they ever be defiled.

   Having food and raiment on earth we are content, but in Heaven, "they
   toil not, neither do they spin: and yet I say unto you, That even
   Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these." Yet the
   fields yield them neither flax nor any other material for clothing,
   neither do the acres of Heaven yield them bread. They are satisfied by
   leaning upon God, needing not the creature for support. They need no
   medicine to heal their disease, "for the inhabitant shall not say, I am
   sick."

   They need no sleep to recruit their fatigue and although sleep is sweet
   and balmy--God's own medicine--yet they rest not day nor night, but
   unweariedly praise Him in His temple. They need no social ties in
   Heaven. We need here the associations of friendship and of family love,
   but they are neither married nor are given in marriage there. Whatever
   comfort they may derive from association with their fellows is
   something extra and beyond--they do not need any-- their God is enough.
   They shall need no teachers there. They shall doubtless commune with
   one another concerning the things of God and tell one another the
   strange things which the Lord has worked for them, but they shall not
   need this by way of instruction. They shall all be taught of the Lord,
   for in Heaven "the Glory of God does lighten it and the Lamb is its
   light."

   There is an utter independence in Heaven, then, of all the creatures.
   No sun and no moon are wanted--no, no creatures whatever! Here we lean
   upon the friendly arm, but there they lean upon their Beloved and upon
   Him alone. Here we must have the help of our companions, but there they
   find all they want in Christ alone. Here we look to the meat which
   perishes and to the raiment which decays before the moth, but there
   they find everything in God. We have to use a bucket to get water from
   the well, but there they drink from the wellhead and put their lips
   down to the Living Water. Here the angels bring us blessings, but we
   shall want no messengers from Heaven then.

   They need no Gabriels there to bring their love-notes from God, for
   there they see Him face to face. Oh, what a blessed time shall that be,
   when we shall have mounted above every second cause and shall hang upon
   the bare arm of God! What a glorious hour when God and not His
   creatures, God and not His works, but God Himself, Christ Himself shall
   be our daily joy!--

   "Plunged in the Godhead's deepest sea, And lost in His immensity."

   Our souls shall then have attained the perfection of bliss. While in
   Heaven it is clear that the glorified are quite independent of creature
   aid--do not forget that they are entirely dependent for their joy upon
   Jesus Christ. He is their sole spiritual light. They have nothing else
   in Heaven to give them perfect satisfaction but Himself.

   The language here used, "the Lamb is its light," may be read in two or
   three ways. By your patience, let us so read it. In Heaven Jesus is the
   light in the sense of joy, for light is ever in Scripture the emblem of
   joy. Darkness betokens sorrow but the rising of the sun indicates the
   return of holy joy. Christ is the Joy of Heaven. Do they rejoice in
   golden harps, in palm branches and white robes? They may do so, but
   they only rejoice in these things as love-gifts from Him. Their joy is
   compounded by this--"Jesus chose us, Jesus loved us, Jesus bought us,
   Jesus washed us, Jesus robed us, Jesus kept us, Jesus glorified us:
   here we are entirely through the Lord Jesus, through Him alone."

   Each one of these thoughts shall be to them like a cluster from the
   vines of Eshcol. Why I think there is an eternal source of joy in that
   one thought, "Jesus bought me with His blood." Oh, to sit on the
   mountains of Heaven and look across to the lowly hill of Calvary and
   see the Savior bleed! What emotions of joy shall stir the depths of our
   soul when we reflect that there upon the bloody tree He counted not His
   life dear unto Him that He might redeem us unto God!--

   "Calvary's summit shall I trace, View the heights and depths of Grace,
   Count the purple drops and say, 'Thus my sins were washed away.'"

   In Glory they think of the Character and Person of Jesus and these are
   wells of delight to them. Thus they muse-- Jesus is eternal. God. His
   enemies reviled Him but still He is God. Jesus became the virgin's
   Child. Jesus lived a life of holiness and Jesus died. But see what
   triumph springs from His condescension and His shame--He rises, He
   ascends and leads captivity captive--He scatters gifts among men! He
   reigns over earth and Hell and Heaven--King of kings and Lord of lords.
   "The government shall be upon His shoulder: and His name shall be
   called Wonderful, The Counselor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting
   Father, The Prince of Peace."

   When I have listened to Handel's music in "The Messiah," where that
   great musician wakes every instrument to praise the name of Jesus, I
   have felt ready to die with excess of delight that such music should
   ever have been composed by mortal man to the honor of our great
   Messiah. But what will be the music of celestial choirs? How would such
   hearts as ours burst and such souls as ours leap out of their bodies if
   they could but know, while here, such joys as celestials know above!

   But, Beloved, our faculties shall be strengthened, our capacities shall
   be enlarged, our whole being shall be expanded and thus we shall be
   able to bear the full swell of seraphic music and join in it without
   fainting from delight, while they sing of the Glory of the Son of
   Man--the Son of God! Christ is the Light of Heaven, then, because He is
   the Substance of its joy. Light may be viewed in another sense. Light
   is the cause of beauty. That is obvious to you all. Take the light away
   and there is no beauty anywhere. The fairest woman charms the eye no
   more than a heap of ashes when the sun has departed. Your garden may he
   bright with many colored flowers, but when the sun goes down you cannot
   know them from the grass which borders them.

   You look upon the trees, all fair with the verdure of summer--but when
   the sun goes down they are all hung in black. Without light no radiance
   flashes from the sapphire, no peaceful ray proceeds from the pearl.
   There is nothing of beauty left when light is gone. Light is the mother
   of beauty. In such sense the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the
   Light of Heaven--that is to say, all the beauty of the saints above
   comes from God Incarnate. Their excellence, their joy, their triumph,
   their glory, their ecstatic bliss all spring from Him. As planets, they
   reflect the light of the Sun of Righteousness. They live as beams
   proceeding from the central orb, as streams leaping from the eternal
   fountain.

   If He withdrew, they must die. If His Glory were veiled, their glory
   must expire. Think of this, Christian, and I am sure you will be
   reminded how true this is beneath the sky, as well as above, that if
   light is the mother of beauty, Christ is the Light! There is nothing
   good, nor lovely, nor gracious about any one of us except as we get it
   from Christ and from Christ Jesus alone. "The Lamb is its light."
   Another meaning of light in Scripture is knowledge. Ignorance is
   darkness. Now in Heaven they need no candle, nor light of the sun
   because they receive light enough from Christ--Christ being the
   fountain of all they know.

   I think it is Dr. Dick who speaks about the enjoyments of Heaven
   consisting very likely in going from star to star and viewing the works
   of God in different portions of His universe, admiring the anatomy of
   living creatures, studying geology, ferrying across the waves of ether
   and voyaging from world to world. I do not believe in such a Heaven for
   a moment! I do not conceive it a worthy employment for immortal
   spirits, and, if there were nothing else to make me think so, the text
   would be enough. "And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the
   moon, to shine in it." There is no need of the works of God to give
   instruction to its inhabitants, "for the Glory of God did lighten it.
   "The Glory, not of God's works, but of God's Son, is their glorious
   Light--

   "The spacious earth and spreading flood
   Proclaim the wise and powerful God.
   And Your rich glories from afar
   Sparkle in every rolling star
   But in His looks a glory stands,
   The noblest labor of Your hands.
   The pleasing luster of His eyes
   Outshines the wonders of the skies."

   They need no light of the sun and moon where Jesus is. However well the
   sun and moon may tell of God, we shall not need them from day to day to
   send forth their light throughout all the earth and their word unto the
   end of the world, for the Glory of Christ will teach us all we wish to
   learn. And beholding the unveiled Glory of God will be far better than
   prying into the works of Nature even though we had an angel's power of
   discovery. We shall know more of Christ in five minutes, when we get to
   Heaven, than we shall know in all our years on earth. Dr. Owen was a
   master of theology, but the smallest child who goes to Heaven from a
   Sunday school knows more of Christ after being in Heaven five minutes,
   than Dr. Owen did.

   John Calvin searched very deep and Augustine seemed to come to the very
   door of the great secret. But Augustine and Calvin would be but
   children on the first form there--I mean if they knew no more than on
   earth. Oh, what manifestations of God there will be! Dark dealings of
   Providence which you never understood before will then be seen without
   the light of a candle or of the sun. Many doctrines puzzled you and you
   could not find the clue to the labyrinth of mystery. But there all will
   be simple and plain so that the wayfaring man may run and understand
   it. You have had many experiences and tossing to and fro and you have
   felt your ignorance, your corruption and weakness. But there you shall
   see to the very bottom of human nature--you shall understand the
   virulence of man's depravity and the heights of God's Sovereignty--the
   marvels of His electing love and the magnificence of His Divine power
   by which He has made us to be partakers of the Divine Nature--

   "There you shall see and hear and know All you desired or wished below,
   And every power find sweet employ In that eternal world of joy."

   And this knowledge, I say, shall not come from any inferior agent but
   from the Lord God who shall be your Glory and from Jesus Christ Himself
   who shall teach you all Truth. I must not dwell longer on this point
   except to say this one thing, that light also means manifestation.
   "Everyone that does evil hates the light, neither comes to the light,
   lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that does truth comes to the
   light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are worked in
   God." Light manifests. In this world it does not yet appear how great
   we must be made. God's people are a hidden people--their life is hid
   with Christ in God. They possess God's secret and that secret other men
   cannot discover.

   Christ in Heaven is the great revealer of God's mind. And when He gets
   His people there, He will touch them with the wand of His own love and
   change them into the image of His manifested Glory. They were poor and
   wretched but what a transformation! Their rags drop off and they are
   acknowledged as princes. They were stained with sin and infirmity, but
   one touch of His finger and they are bright as the sun and clear as
   crystal--transformed even as He was upon Mount Tabor--whiter than any
   fuller can make them.

   They were ignorant and weak on earth but when He shall teach them, they
   shall know even as they are known. They were buried in dishonor but
   they are raised in glory. They were sown in the grave in weakness but
   they are raised in power. They were carried away by the hands of
   remorseless Death but they arise to immortality and life. Oh, what a
   manifestation! Light is sown for the righteous and Christ is the sacred
   rain that brings the harvest above ground. The righteous are always
   pearls but they are hidden, as it were, in the oyster and Christ brings
   them forth. They were always diamonds, they were far away in the
   Golconda of sin. But Christ has fetched them up from the deep mines.
   They were always stars but they were hidden behind the clouds. Christ,
   like a swift wind, has blown the clouds away and now they shine like
   stars in the firmament forever and ever.

   In this sense Christ is the Light of Heaven, because it is through Him
   that the true and real character of all the saints has been manifested.
   Come, my Soul, take wing a moment--it is not far for you to fly--mount
   and walk the golden streets and as you walk you shall see nothing but
   Jesus glorified! Come up to the Throne and you shall see Christ on it.
   Sit down and listen to the song--Christ is the theme! Go to the
   banquet--Christ is the meat! Mingle with the dancers-- Christ is their
   joy! Make you one in their great assemblies and Christ is the God they
   worship--"Worthy the Lamb that died," they cry--

   "To be exalted thus--
   'Worthy the Lamb,' our lips reply,
   For He was slain for us."

   III. Let us turn to our last thought. And here I hope we can speak
   experimentally, whereas on the other two points we could only speak by
   faith in the promise of God. THE HEAVENLY MAN'S STATE MAY BE SET FORTH
   IN THESE WORDS. First, then, even on earth the heavenly man's joy does
   not depend upon the creature. Brethren, in a certain sense we can say
   today that, "the city has no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to
   shine in it." We love and prize the happy brightness which the sun
   scatters upon us. As for the moon, who does not admire the fair
   moonlight when the waves are silvered and silent Nature wears the
   plumage of the dove?

   But we do not need the sun or the moon! We can do without them for the
   Sun of Righteousness has risen with healing beneath His wings. There
   are Brothers and Sisters here this morning who are very happy and yet
   it is long since they saw the sun. Shut up in perpetual night, through
   blindness, they need not the light of the sun nor of the moon, for the
   Lord God is their Glory--Christ is their Light. If our eyes should be
   put out, we could say, "Farewell, sweet light, farewell, bright sun and
   moon--we prize you well, but we can do without you--Christ Jesus is to
   us as the light of seven days."

   As we can do without these two most eminent creatures, so we can be
   happy without other earthly blessings. Our dear friends are very
   precious to us--we love our wife and children, our parents and our
   friends--but we do not need them. May God spare them for us! But if
   they were taken it does not come to a matter of absolute need, for you
   know, Beloved, there is many a Christian who has been bereft of all and
   he thought, as the props were taken away one after another, that he
   should die of very grief. But he did not die--his faith surmounted
   every wave and he still rejoices in his God!

   I know that at the thought of those dear ones who are taken from you
   the sluices of your grief are drawn up, but still I hope you will not
   be so false to Christ as to deny what I now say--that His Presence can
   make amends for all losses-- that the smile of His face will make a
   paradise so sweet that no sorrow or sighing shall be heard in it--

   "You, at all times will I bless.
   Having You, I all possess!
   How can I bereaved,
   Since I cannot part with You?"

   It is a very happy thing to be placed in circumstances where one knows
   no lack of bread--to have a house, a comfortable home and sufficient
   monies for our family is very pleasant--but O dear Friends, if it comes
   to actual need, the Christian does not want this! He needs no sun nor
   moon even here! Look at the chosen sons of poverty--they toil from
   morning to night and never get a single inch beyond. Living from hand
   to mouth they are happy! Ah, some of them infinitely happier than the
   rich man with all his sumptuous fares and the fine linen with which he
   wraps himself. Why there have been men reduced to all but beggary who
   have rejoiced far more in their poverty than others in their wealth--we
   have seen some of God's saints in the workhouse--or lingering in a dark
   ill-furnished alms room and we have heard them speak as joyously about
   God and their state as if they were dwelling in mansions or palaces!
   Yes, many a poor child of God has learned to sing--

   "I would not change my blessed estate
   For all the world calls good or great.
   And while my faith can keep her hold,
   I envy not the sinner's gold."

   For "this city has no need of the sun, nor of the moon, to shine in it,
   for the Glory of God does lighten it and the Lamb is its light."
   Health, too--who can prize it enough? When stretched upon the bed of
   sickness--then we begin to know how priceless a gift was a sound body!
   But ah, the Christian, though he loves health can do without it. I have
   heard of Christians who have been blind and who have been bedridden and
   have not stirred from their bed for many years. They could scarcely
   lift their hands through paralysis and never had stood upon their feet
   for many years through some stroke of God's hand. Yet they have
   delighted themselves in the Lord!

   They have laid there ill-nursed, ill-cared for--simply living to
   illustrate to what degree a mortal man may become a mass of suffering
   and a prodigy of grief! And yet, as I have sometimes stood by such
   bedsides, I have heard more rapturous expressions concerning present
   joy and future prospects than from God's strongest saints in their
   healthiest hours! The dying girl, when consumption has paled her cheek
   and taken the flesh from off her poor aching bones, has nevertheless
   appeared in a sacred majesty of might which showed me that she needed
   no moon nor sun to lighten her, no health nor strength to give her
   spirits--for the Presence of Christ made her conqueror in the extremity
   of weakness and victorious in the grim presence of Death itself!

   The Christian, then, dear Friends, leans upon the arm of God--he has
   pressed through the crowd of creatures--he has bid them all retire that
   he might live nearer to his All-Sufficient Lord! And if, when he has
   reached his Lord, the creatures turn their backs and go away, he says,
   "There, you may all go! I have Him now! I embrace Him now! He has
   kissed me with the kisses of His lips. You may spit on me and you
   will--now He has spoken softly to me--you may curse me if you please.
   Now that He has told me I am His and He is mine, even my father and
   mother may forsake me, for the Lord has taken me up." Yes, the heavenly
   man, even before he gets to Heaven has no need of the sun nor of the
   moon, for the Glory of God does lighten him.

   We finish by observing that such a man, however, has great need of
   Christ--he cannot get on without Christ. O Beloved, if the sun were
   struck from the spheres what a poor, dark, dreary world this would be!
   We should go groping about, longing for the grave. But that would be
   nothing compared with our misery if Christ were taken away! O
   Christian, what would you do without a Savior? We should be of all men
   the most miserable--we who have once known Him!

   Ah, you who do not know Christ--you can get on pretty well without
   Him--like a poor slave who has never known liberty and rests content in
   bondage. The bird in its cage which never did fly over the
   fields--which has been born in the cage--can be pretty easy. But after
   we have once stretched our wings and once know what liberty means we
   cannot be shut out from our Lord. As the dove mourns itself to death
   when its mate is taken away, so should we if Christ were gone. We can
   do without light, without friendship, without life--but we cannot live
   without our Savior! Oh, to be without Christ? My Soul, what would you
   do in the world without Him in the midst of its temptations and its
   cares? What would you do in the morning without Him when you wake up
   and look forward to the day's battle?

   What would you do if He did not put His hand upon you and say, "Fear
   not, I am with you"? And what would you do at night, when you come home
   jaded and weary, if there were no prayer, no door of access between you
   and Christ? What should we do without Christ in our trials, our
   sicknesses? What should we do when we come to die with no one to make
   our dying bed feel soft as downy pillows? Oh, if the infidel's laugh
   has truth in it, it may well ring bitterly in our ears, for it were a
   bitter truth to us. No Christ? Then to die is dreadful, indeed!

   To have such high hopes and to have them all blasted! High, loud
   boasting and to have our mouths stopped forever! But, Beloved, we need
   not suppose such a thing for we know that our Redeemer lives and we
   know that He never forsakes the work of own hand. Married as He is to
   our souls, He will never sue for divorce against any one of His dear
   people, but He will hold and bless us till we die. And we on our part
   will confess of our spiritual life that the Lamb is its light. Of every
   day and every night--of every joy and every sorrow--the Lamb has been
   until now our light and shall be till we die.

   If this is so, how dark is the case of those who do not know the Lamb?
   In what misery and ignorance do you grope who do not know the Savior?
   Would you know Christ, would you have the happiness of resting upon His
   bosom? Trust Him, then--for whoever trusts Him is saved. To trust
   Christ is that saving faith which brings the soul out of condemnation.
   "He that believes on Him is not condemned." Trust, guilty as you
   are--trust to His Atonement and it shall wash you! Trust to His
   power--it shall prevail for you! Trust to His wisdom--it shall protect
   you! Trust to His heart--it shall love you, world without end. Amen.

                              A Hearer In Disguise

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY EVENING, JULY 31, 1864, BY THE REV. C. H. SPURGEON,
   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Audit was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in
   at the door, thathe said, Come in, you wife of Jeroboam; why do you
   pretend to be another? For I am sent to you with heavy tidings."

   1 Kings 14:6.

   AHIJAH the Prophet was blind. Did I not tell you this morning that
   God's servants could be happy without the light of the sun? If God
   should be pleased to deprive their natural eyes of the pleasures of
   light their souls would not be without joy, for as in the New
   Jerusalem, so in the renewed heart--"the glory of God does lighten it
   and the Lamb is its Light. " Doubtless this was the case with that
   venerable Prophet. He was not like Moses, whose eyes did not wax dim
   and whose natural strength did not abate. But his eyes were set with
   age. The organs of vision had so decayed through the multitude of his
   years that he could not see so much as a ray of light.

   Yet doubtless when he could not look out of the windows, God looked in.
   And when there was no beam coming in from the sun, much light was
   darted in from Heaven. What man of modern times saw more than blind
   Milton? It were well for us to feel the influence of that "drop
   serene," and close our eyes forever if we could but see such visions of
   God as Milton has penned in his Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained.
   Here is a fine picture for you. Behold the venerable Prophet sitting
   alone in his humble cottage. And yet not alone, because his God is with
   him. Blind, but yet in the highest sense a Seer, looking into the
   invisible and by faith beholding things which we blind men who have our
   sight can never see!

   Ahijah beheld what eye has not seen and heard what ear has never heard.
   This, then, may furnish a word of comfort at the outset to any who are
   suffering under infirmity--Jesus can mend you. You are not the only
   persons who have been called to suffer. Full many of your humble
   guild--the company of the blind--have been gifted with spiritual sight.
   If you have lost hearing, or the use of any of the members of your
   body, remember that no strange thing has happened to you but such as is
   common to man. There is a way by which, in proportion as your
   tribulations abound, so your consolations may abound through Jesus
   Christ!

   No, these very privations which you feel so sadly, which so loudly
   demand our sympathy, may by God's love be transmuted into mercies by a
   holy alchemy which really turns iron into gold! He can turn your losses
   into gains and your curses into blessings. Mark well this venerable
   Prophet--a man so old as to have survived the senses which give life
   its charm--is it not time for him to die? Has he not outlived his
   usefulness when he is made entirely dependent upon his fellow creatures
   and a burden to himself? Why does not the Prophet's Master send a
   convoy of angels to take the good man Home?

   There he sits without any apparent perception of the scenes transpiring
   around him. Surely, surely it is time for the Master to call him away!
   But no, He does not. Ahijah must not die! He has another message to
   deliver and he is immortal till his work is done. I have no doubt he
   sweetly slept after he had delivered his last message, but not till
   then. Brothers and Sisters, you and I have no right to want to go to
   Heaven till our work is done! There is a desire to be with Christ which
   is not only natural but spiritual. There is a sighing to behold His
   face which if a man is without I shall question if he is a Christian at
   all! But to wish to be away from the battle before we win the victory
   and to desire to leave the field before the day is over is but lazy and
   listless! Therefore let us pray God to save us from it.

   Whitfield and a company of ministers were talking together and
   expressing their desire to go to Heaven. Good Mr. Tennant was the only
   man who differed from them. He said he did not wish to die. And he
   thought that if his Brother Whitfield would but consider for a time, he
   would not wish to be gone, either. He said, if you hire a man to do a
   day's work and he is saying all the day, "I wish it were evening, I
   wish it were time to go home," you would think," what a lazy fellow he
   is," and you would wish you had never engaged him. "So," he said, "I am
   afraid it is nothing but our idleness that often prompts us to desire
   to be away from our work."

   If there is a soul to win, let me not stop until I have won it. Truly
   some of us might summon up courage enough to say, "I would gladly
   barter Heaven for the Glory of Christ and not only wait twenty years
   out of Heaven if I may have twenty years of glorifying Him the better,
   but wait out altogether if I may outside Heaven sing to Him sweeter
   songs and honor Him more than I can inside its walls. For outside
   Heaven shall be Heaven to me if it shall help me to glorify my Lord and
   Master the better."

   You have heard, I dare say, that anecdote of good Mr. Whitfield? In his
   early ministry, lying down, as he thought, to die in a high fever, a
   poor Negro woman was sitting by his side and tending him. In his sad
   moments Whitfield thought of dying, but the black woman said, "No,
   master Whitfield, you are not to die yet. There are thousands of souls
   to bring to Christ! So keep up your spirits, for you must live and not
   die--your Master has yet work for you to do."

   All this comes to my mind as I think of that venerable old Prophet,
   sitting in his chair, waiting until he shall have spoken to Jeroboam's
   wife. And then after that ascending to his Father and his God--but not
   until his work was done. We have introduced to you Ahijah, the
   venerable Prophet. We must now address you upon an incident connected
   with his closing ministry. In our text we have before us an occasional
   hearer. Secondly we observe a useless disguise. And thirdly we listen
   to heavy tidings.

   I. We have before us, first of all, THE OCCASIONAL HEARER. Jeroboam and
   his wife did not often go to hear Ahijah. They were not people who went
   to worship Jehovah. They neither feared God nor regarded His Prophet.
   There may be some such here tonight. You do not often come to a place
   of worship. I am glad you are here now. It may be my Master has sent me
   with tidings for you. Give earnest heed, I pray, that the tidings may
   be received and blessed. I am sometimes tired of preaching to those who
   hear me every Sunday for I fear some of them never will be saved.

   They get hardened by the Gospel. All the blows of the hammer have only
   tended to weld their hearts to their sins and make them harder instead
   of melting them. May God grant, however, that my fears may be removed
   and that some who have long resisted the wooings of the Gospel may yet
   yield. I have more hope of you occasional hearers--I know that when my
   Master has helped me to cast the net on the right side of the ship I
   have taken some of you. There are among those numbered with us some of
   the best in the Church and the most useful men in our society who were
   brought in by dropping into the place just as stray hearers--passing
   by, perhaps, or coming out of curiosity. But God knew who they were,
   knew how to adapt the sermon to the case and affect the heart with the
   Word!

   Now, here was an occasional hearer. And we make the observation that
   this occasional hearer was totally destitute of all true piety. Most
   occasional hearers are. Those who have true religion are not occasional
   hearers. You will find that truly gracious persons are diligent in the
   use of the means. Instead of thinking it a toil to come up to the place
   of worship, I know there are some of you who wish there were two
   Sundays in the week. And the happiest times you ever have are when you
   are sitting in these seats and joining in our sacred songs--

   "Your earthly Sabbaths, Lord, we love." There is no verse which gives
   you a better idea of Heaven as a place than that--

   "Where congregations never break up, And Sabbaths have no end."

   Gracious souls love the place where God's honor dwells and the
   assembling of themselves together is always a blessed thing to them.
   But occasional hearers are generally graceless persons. I know how you
   spend your Sunday. There is the morning--you are not up very early. It
   takes a long time to dress on a Sunday morning. Then follows the Sunday
   paper, with the news of the week that must be gone through. The wife
   has been toiling hard all the morning with the dinner-- what do you
   care? Then there is the afternoon, when there is a little more lolling
   about. Then in the evening there is the walk. But the day, after all,
   is not very happy and comfortable--and sometimes you have wished there
   were no Sundays except that they give your body a little rest.

   You do not fear God, nor do you care for His service. Nevertheless I am
   glad you have come here tonight for who can tell?--my Lord, who found
   out Jeroboam's wife, can find you out. And though it is many a day
   since you darkened the walls of God's sanctuary, this shall be the
   beginning of many such days to you. And who can tell?--this may be your
   new-birth night when you shall turn over a new leaf! No, not turn over
   a new leaf, but get a new look altogether and find your name written in
   the Lamb's Book of Life.

   The second remark about these occasional hearers is that when they do
   come, they very generally come because they are in trouble. When
   Jeroboam's wife came and spoke to the Prophet it was because the dear
   child was ill at home. I know some occasional hearers who go to a place
   of worship as people go to a pharmacy--that is when they want something
   because they do not feel quite right. Yes, your child is very sick. You
   have been watching all day and you have thought, "I cannot stand it any
   longer. I will just walk out and go to a place of worship tonight. I
   want something to cheer me."

   You have had such trials lately that your wife said to you, "John, we
   must not keep on in this way any longer. It is clear all we do ends
   without any prosperity. We put our money into a bag which is full of
   holes. We spend it for that which is not bread. We labor for that which
   does not profit." So you have come here to see if the Lord may have a
   word of comfort through His servant who speaks to you. I can only say
   you are very welcome to come in, you wife of Jeroboam! We are as glad
   to see you as though you always came and we do hope that this sorrowful
   affliction may be overruled by God for your lasting good.

   There are persons who profess to be atheists, but their atheism is not
   very deep. Addison tells us of a man who, on board ship in a storm,
   knelt down to pray and expressed his firm belief in a God. When he got
   ashore someone laughed at him for it and he challenged the man to a
   duel. They fought together and the atheist fell wounded. When the blood
   was flowing he believed there was a God and he began to cry to God with
   all his might to save him. The physician bound up the wound. The man
   put the question to him--"Is it mortal?" "No," the doctor said, "it is
   only a flesh wound." "Then," said the man, "there is no God. I am a
   thorough atheist."

   He believed in God when he thought he was going to die--the moment he
   felt himself better he returned to his unbelief. A pretty religion,
   that, to live in and a pretty religion to die with! Your absence from
   God's House will do very well when things go well with you--you can go
   out with a young wife to dissipate in frivolity hours which should be
   sacred to worship. But when sickness comes and when affliction falls
   heavily upon you--when you have trial after trial and you, yourself,
   begin to get gray with many cares, and feeble and helpless with many
   years. And when death comes near and casts his pale shadow across your
   cheek. And strange thoughts, oblivious of all around, come over you by
   day, and singular dreams which throw you into the company of the long
   since dead, surprise you by night.

   When fears and frights and signs and calls and bodings of imagination
   prove the wanderings and weakness of your brain--then, but possibly not
   till then--you will think of going to the house of God. I am glad,
   therefore, if this trouble has visited you early, or ever "the grinders
   cease because they are few and those that look out of the windows are
   darkened." And I am very glad that you have come to the House of God.
   Come in, you wife of Jeroboam, for I bear you tidings from the God of
   Heaven tonight!

   There is a third point--this woman would not have come but that her
   husband sent her on the ground that he had heard Ahijah preach before.
   It was this Prophet who took Jeroboam's mantle and rent it in pieces
   and told him he was to be king over the ten tribes. That message proved
   true--therefore Jeroboam had confidence in Ahijah. There are some of
   you who at times used to hear the Gospel. You have not been of late.
   But there were seasons when you did come up to God's House--yes, and
   times when you used to tremble under God's Word. If I am not mistaken,
   there are men and women here tonight who once were conscience-stricken.
   The Word of God used to come home to you with exceeding great power and
   make you tremble.

   Did you not even profess faith in Christ? Why, some of you were very
   busy at revival meetings trying to bring others to the Savior. But your
   religion was like smoke out of the chimney--it has all blown away. Like
   early mist it was soon scattered when the sun had risen. Yet the
   remembrance of these things sticks by you now. You cannot help it--you
   feel there must be something in religion. The old stings which were in
   your conscience have not been quite extracted. Therefore at the present
   moment you are quite willing to listen to the Word--perhaps even hoping
   that it may come with true power now and that you may, after all, be
   saved!

   I wish I could wake the echoes of the slumbering consciences of some of
   you! O that I could recall the days of your youth--the times of your
   boyhood and girlhood--when you went up to the assembly of the saints to
   keep holy day! Those things you cannot quite forget. I pray that such
   remembrances may often turn your feet towards the place of wor- ship.
   We have brought out three points of character--they were persons of no
   piety. In trouble they sought the Prophet. And they had confidence in
   him because they had heard him preach before.

   But there is one more point--they had one godly member of their family
   and that brought them to see the Prophet. Their child was sick and ill
   and it was that which led them to enquire at the hands of the Lord. I
   hope there is no family here which has the misfortune to be without a
   Believer in it. You, Man, have no fear of God. But strange to say, the
   Lord has taken one out of your family to be a witness for Him. That
   daughter of yours, you sometimes jeer at her, but you know you value
   her! You used to send her to the Sunday school just to get rid of her,
   but the Lord met with her. And what a comfort she has been to you! How
   glad she has made your heart, though you do not tell her so!

   Perhaps the godly one in the family is like this young Ahijah in the
   text, he is sick and near death. You can remember, though you do not
   fear God, how the darling boy was sick! How you sat by his little bed
   and took his hand in yours when it was scarcely anything but skin and
   bone! How he prayed for you at night, that God would save father and
   mother and take them to Heaven! And how, just as he died, he looked out
   on you with those bright eyes so soon to be filmed in death and said,
   "Father, will you not follow me?"

   Since that time you have often felt that something is beckoning you up
   yonder. And though you have gone on forsaking God and despising holy
   things, yet still there is a little link between you and Heaven which
   is not snapped yet and you sometimes feel it tugging at your heart. I
   pray God it may tug so hard tonight that your heart may go up to God
   and lay hold of Jesus, the Savior of sinners! What joy it causes me to
   think that God does call one out of a godless household because where
   there is one there is sure to be another before long! It is like
   putting a light into the midst of stubble-- there will soon be a blaze.

   I have hope of a family when one child is converted, for Grace is like
   precious ointment--it spreads a perfume all around. When a box of
   fragrant spice is put into a room the perfume soon fills the entire
   chamber, then creeps silently up the stairs into the upper rooms and
   ceases not its work until it has filled the whole house. So when there
   is true Grace in a house, the Holy Spirit blesses its hallowed power,
   till even the lodgers and family acquaintances begin to feel the
   influence of it! Is it your one praying child that has brought you here
   tonight? May God grant that he may be the means of bringing you to
   Heaven as well!

   But there is one sad reflection which should alarm the occasional
   hearer. Through Jeroboam's wife did come to the Prophet that once and
   heard tidings, yet she and her husband perished after all. Oh, if there
   were the register kept of the many thousands who come inside the
   Tabernacle gates and listen to our voice, I am afraid--I am sadly
   afraid it would be found that there were many who did hear the tidings
   and did tremble at them, too--who nevertheless despised the counsels of
   the Most High! They have turned not at His rebuke, went on in their sin
   and perished without hope. Shall it be so with any of you?

   Are you to be firewood in Hell? Will you make your bed among the
   flames? My Hearers, will you die without God and without hope? Will you
   leap into the black unknown with no bright promise of the Savior to
   cheer you in the thick darkness? May God prevent it! May He be pleased
   to bring you to Christ, the Rock of your salvation, that you may depend
   upon Him with your whole heart! While thus speaking about the
   occasional hearer, an idea haunts my mind that I have been drawing
   somebody's portrait. I think there are some here who have had their
   character and conduct sketched out quite accurately enough for them to
   know who is meant. Do remember that if the description fits you, it is
   meant for you. And if you, yourself, have been described, do not look
   about among your neighbors and say, "I think this is like somebody
   else." If it is like you, take it home to yourself and God send it into
   the center of your conscience so that you cannot get rid of it.

   II. Our second consideration is the USELESS DISGUISE. Jeroboam's wife
   thought to herself, "If I go to see Ahijah, as he knows me to be the
   wife of Jeroboam, he is sure to speak angrily and give me very bad
   news." Strange to tell, though the poor old gentleman was blind, she
   thought it necessary to put on a disguise! So she removed her best
   garment and put on a countrywoman's russet gown and away she went. She
   left the scepter and crown behind and took a basket, as though she had
   just come from market.

   In this basket she did not put gold, jewels and silver, but a present
   such as a farmer's wife might bring. There were loaves and biscuits and
   a jar of honey. And as she went along, she thought, "The old gentleman
   will not know me." She traveled through her own dominions and nobody
   knew her. She went into the neighboring dominions of Judah as far as

   Shiloh. And she pleased her imagination with the thought, "How I shall
   deceive him! I will ask him a question, as if I were a farmer's wife
   and he will not know who I am. He will be pleased with my present and
   prophesy soft things concerning my child."

   How great was her surprise! No sooner did the blind Prophet hear her
   footsteps, than he said, "Come in, you wife of Jeroboam. Why do you
   pretend to be another? For I am sent to you with heavy tidings." How
   she started back with astonishment! She had deceived hundreds who were
   blessed with eyes, but here was a man who not only could not be
   deceived, but found her out before she had opened her lips and
   recognized her before she had time to test her sorry lies or tell her
   subtle tale! "Come in, you wife of Jeroboam." I do not suppose there is
   anybody come here disguised as to dress tonight, though such things may
   happen. The working man who is afraid he shall be laughed at if he is
   known may come here in disguise.

   Now and then a clergyman may come in who would not be very comfortable
   in his conscience if it were known he did such a thing and so he does
   not show himself exactly in his regular garb. Notwithstanding whoever
   you may be, disguised or not, it is of no use where God's Gospel is
   preached! It is a quick discerner and will find out the thoughts and
   intents of the heart. It will search you out and unmask your true
   character, disguise yourself as you may. Many who come to God's House
   not disguised in dress, are still disguised in manner and appearance.
   How good you all look! When we sing and you take your books, how
   heavenly-minded! And when we pray, how reverent you are! How your heads
   are all bowed-- your eyes covered with your hands!

   I do not know what you all say in your hats when you come in and I
   should not like to know. I do not know how much praying there is when
   you sit in a devout posture, though you assume the attitude and compose
   your countenance as those who draw near to supplicate the Lord. I am
   afraid there are many of you who do not pray a word or present a
   petition, though you assume the posture of suppliants. When the singing
   is going on there are many who never sing a word with spirit and
   understanding. In the house of God I am afraid there are many who wear
   a mask--they stand as God's people stand, sit as they sit, pray as they
   pray, and sing as they sing--and all the while what are you doing?

   Some of you have been attending to your children while we have been
   singing tonight. Some of you have been casting up your ledger,
   attending to your farms, scheming about your carpentering and
   bricklaying! Yet all the while if we had looked into your faces we
   might have thought you were reverently worshipping God. Oh, those
   solemn faces and those reverent looks! They do not deceive the Most
   High God! He knows who and what you are. As you are in His House, He
   sees you as clearly as men see through glass.

   As for hiding from the Almighty, how can you hide yourself from Him? As
   well attempt to hide in a glass cage, for all the world is a glass cage
   before God. When you look into a glass beehive, you can see the bees
   and everything they do--such is this world--a sort of glass beehive in
   which God can see everything. The eyes of God are on you continually.
   No veil of hypocrisy can screen you from Him. There may be some among
   you who occasionally sit here, some members of this Church who, after
   all, may pretend to be other than you are. It is a melancholy and a
   most solemn reflection that there are many who profess to be Christians
   who are not Christians.

   There was a Judas among the twelve. There was a Demas among the early
   disciples. And we must always expect to find chaff on God's floor
   mingled with the wheat. I have tried, the Lord knows, to preach as
   plainly and as much home to the mark as I could to sift and try you.
   But for all that the hypocrite will come in. After the most searching
   ministry there are still some who will wrap themselves about with a
   mantle of deception. Though we cry aloud and spare not and bid you lay
   hold on eternal life, yet, alas, how many are content with a mere name
   to live but are dead? Many come here and even hold office in the
   Church, yes, the minister himself may even preach the Word and, after
   all, be hollow and empty.

   How many who dress and look fair outside are, as John Bunyan said, only
   fit to be tinder for the devil's tinder box-- for they are all dry and
   sere within! God save us from a profession if it is not real! I pray
   that we may know the worst of our case. If I must be damned, I would
   sooner go to Hell unholy than as a hypocrite. That backdoor to the pit
   is the thing I dread most of all! Oh, to sit at the Lord's Table and to
   drink of the cup of devils! To be recognized among God's own here and
   then to find one's own name left out when He reads the muster roll of
   His servants! Oh, what a portion for eternity!

   I bid you tear off this mask, and if the Grace of God is not in you, I
   pray you go into the world which will be your fitting place! Abstain
   from joining the Church if you are not really a member of the body of
   Christ. You see why I urge this--because no dressing up, however neatly
   it may be done--can conceal us from God. Oh, how some who have been
   fair on earth have been startled when they thought they were going into
   Heaven! They had their foot almost on the doorstep, but the angel came
   and said, "Get out of here, wife of Jeroboam. I know you! You could
   deceive the minister! You could deceive the deacons! You could get
   baptized and join the Church. But you can not enter here! Get out! Your
   portion is with the filthy in the pit of Hell."

   O, may Jesus never say this to you and me! But may we all be so real
   here that He may say, "Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the
   kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world." "O God, see
   me!" Write that on the palm of your hand and look at it. Wake up in the
   morning with it. Sleep with it before you on your curtains. "O, God,
   see me!"--

   "O may this thought possess my breast,
   WhereverIrove, whereverIrest
   Nor let my weaker passions dare
   Consent to sin, for God is there!"

   III. Now we come to a close with a few words upon the HEAVY TIDINGS.
   The woman stood amazed as the Prophet proceeded to expose the iniquity
   of her husband's house, the certain judgment which God would execute,
   and the terrible disgrace with which the name of Jeroboam should be
   execrated because they had revolted from God and set up for themselves
   the calves of Baal. As for the child, respecting whom she had come to
   enquire, he should die. That death was the quenching of a bright spark
   in the heart of the parents but none the less a mercy for the youth.

   "All Israel shall mourn for him and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam
   shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing
   toward the Lord God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam." Let me linger
   on this part of the narrative a moment. In that wicked house there was
   one bright gem upon which the Lord put a high value. The lad was taken
   from the evil to come. The kindness of the Lord appeared in his
   death--while all the judgments were reserved for his father's family.

   Do I not speak to some of you ungodly persons who have lost your little
   children and while you wept bitter tears as you carried them to the
   grave, you said, "Well, he is better off," or, "she sleeps in Jesus"?
   Did you ever think, that as for you, you are worse off? You have no
   hope and are living without God in the world. Let us picture Jeroboam
   and his wife at the tent of their son. There was everything to cheer
   the heart as to him who had departed. But everything to fill the soul
   with gloom concerning those who remained. The like has been the case at
   the funerals of your gracious little ones. We need shed no tears over
   the bier. Let us keep our lamentations for the mourners who attend the
   funeral.

   Ah, but you may make the reflections all your own. You, too, have been
   outside the gates of the city to carry your offspring to the spot in
   God's acre where they now slumber. Did you think in that mournful hour
   that the first fruits of your household was holy unto the Lord? We
   never cease to wonder that the young should die. Yet it has ever been
   so. And well, indeed, can I believe that mercy of a sweet-smelling
   savor is to be found in those dispensations of God's Providence which
   so often darken the windows of our heart and wither the fairest buds in
   our garden.

   Where of old did Death strike its first dart? Did it pierce the heart
   of Adam, the sinner, or strike down the relentless Cain? No, but
   righteous Abel was the first of men who departed from earth to be
   absent from the body and present with the Lord! Even so have you, full
   many of you, committed your children to the dust in an assured hope for
   them, according to the Word of the Lord. A hope which you cannot
   cherish for yourselves! O Sinners, be cautious of your tears, your
   sighs and your groans--pour them not out with such profuseness as an
   offering at the graves of those who sleep in Jesus and are blest. You
   will need them all for your own souls presently! Take up a lamentation
   for your own doom! Unless you repent, your funerals, O ungodly ones,
   will call for shrill notes of endless despair!

   Let me pause. I have glad tidings to preach to some of you before I yet
   again deliver these heavy tidings to those who despise the Word. Is
   there one soul here that desires to be saved? Sinner, I have glad
   tidings for you! Here are the words, "Whoever will, let him come and
   take of the Water of Life freely." Though you have been a drunkard or a
   swearer-- though you have been a whoremonger or a thief--yet there is
   salvation for any man who comes to Jesus Christ for it. And if the
   Spirit of God moves you to come now--

   "Let not conscience make you linger. Nor of fitness fondly dream. All
   the fitness He requires,
   Is to feel your need of Him.
   This He gives you!
   It is His Spirit's rising beam."

   You say, "How can I go to Christ?" It is no great effort. It is, in
   fact, the absence of all effort. You have not to climb to Heaven to
   reach Him, nor to travel to the ends of the earth to find Him. Never
   doubt, if the Holy Spirit is with you, you may find Him tonight. The
   way to be saved is simply to trust Christ. Jesus Christ took the guilt
   of His people and carried it Himself. If you trust Him, you shall have
   peace, for Jesus took your sin. An old woman servant was once carrying
   a large bough of a tree to have it cut into pieces to make a fire. A
   little boy, one of the family, seeing the end of it dragging along the
   ground and making it very heavy, came and took hold of the end, and the
   burden grew light. Then said the servant, "Ah, master Frank, I wish you
   could take hold of one end of the greater burden that I have to
   carry--I have a burden of sin. The more I drag it about, the heavier it
   becomes. I wish Jesus Christ would take hold of one end of it."

   The little boy said, "My mother told me yesterday that Jesus Christ
   carries all our sins, therefore, you do not need Jesus Christ to carry
   one end of it, He will take the whole of it." The poor woman, who had
   been long seeking rest, found it by that remark of the child. Yes,
   Jesus does take your sins! If you trust Christ, this is the evidence
   that all your sins are laid on Him--

   "Sinner, do nothing, Either great or small. Jesus did it, did it all,
   Long, long ago."

   Your salvation is finished by Christ if you believe. Not only the first
   strokes, but the finishing touch Christ has given. The bath you shall
   wash in, He has filled it. The robe you shall wear, He has woven it.
   The crown you shall wear, He has bought it. The Heaven you shall
   inhabit, He has prepared it. "It is finished!" All you have to do is to
   wear it. Take it and wear it! Accept it as a gift of His Free Grace.

   May God bring you into such a mind that you may be willing to receive
   it. And if you are willing to receive it, take it, take it and go your
   way rejoicing. Thus you see, I bring good tidings to seekers. But I
   have a heavy message for some of you. Let me deliver it as in the sight
   of God, with deep solemnity of purpose. Sinner, unrepentant Sinner, I
   have heavy tidings for you. You are now under God's wrath. The wrath of
   God abides on you. It is not as though a tempest hovered in the sky--it
   has gathered round your devoted head! "God is angry with the wicked
   every day." Sinner, God has bent His bow and made it ready and fitted
   His arrow to the string and He has pointed it at you.

   He has furbished His sword and made it sharp and it is sharp for you! O
   barren fig tree, the axe is laid at your root! God even now looks upon
   you with anger as you do offend Him and sin against Him with a high
   hand. Turn! Turn! For it is either turn or burn! And God give you to
   turn lest you burn forever! I have worse tidings still, worse than you
   think. There is speedy death for you. I know not how long you may live.
   But out of this vast assembly there is every probability that one or
   two of us will be in eternity before next Sunday. You can calculate
   that as well as I can. There is a certain number of deaths in the
   population every week.

   Here are several of you gathered here--some six or seven thousand
   immortal souls. And we may die--but there are some of us who must die.
   It is rarely a week passes without a death of someone in this Church,
   much more in the congregation. I suppose I never did address the same
   assembly twice and never shall. And though you were all willing to come
   next Sunday, yet there would be some of you who could not come because
   you will have appeared at the bar of God. Prepare to meet your God!
   There is no cholera abroad, but death has other weapons. The fever
   sleeps, but the gates to the grave are many and you may pass through
   one of them before ever you are aware of it. Prepare! Prepare! Because
   He says, "Prepare to meet your God, O Israel!"

   I have heavy tidings for some of you. I give you warning to set your
   house in order, for you must die and not live. I speak now
   prophetically of some here present! Let them take heed unto their ways
   lest the day of Grace pass and they die are they have thought of
   Christ. I have heavier tidings still. After death the judgment. First
   comes the skeleton king. And then Hell follows him. Oh, is it true that
   some of us may be in Hell before another week? True! Alas! Too true! I
   do evoke you, then--since there is this possibility, no, since there is
   an absolute certainty that before long, except we repent, we shall all
   likewise perish--I do plead with you to think upon your eternal state!

   By the wrath of God and by the love of God--by your own soul and by the
   value of it--by Heaven and its joys, which you will lose! By Hell and
   its torments, which you must endure! By the blood of Jesus! By the
   groans and sweat of that Redeemer who delights to receive sinners and
   who declares that any who come to Him He will in nowise cast out, I
   beseech you, as your Brother and your friend, fly, fly, fly to Jesus!

   May the Lord help you to trust Him now. There, just as you are, flat
   before the Cross, Sinner--no stopping, no waiting, no preparing--come
   to Jesus in all your sin--all black and filthy, just as you are!
   "Mercy's gate is never shut, Jesus' heart is never hard." His blood
   shall never lose its power. Do you trust Him? Trust Him! Trust Him and
   we will meet in Heaven to praise His name, world without end. Amen.

                  A Mystery! Saints Sorrowing and Jesus Glad!

   A Sermon

   (No. 585)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, August 7th, 1864, by the

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead. And I am glad for
   your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe;
   nevertheless let us go unto him"--John 11:14-15.

   There lived in the little village of Bethany a very happy family. There
   was neither father nor mother in it: the household consisted of the
   unmarried brother Eleazar, or Lazarus, and his sisters, Martha and
   Mary, who dwelt together in unity so good and pleasant that there the
   Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore. This affectionate
   trio were all lovers of the Lord Jesus Christ, and were frequently
   favoured with His company. They kept open house whenever the Great
   Teacher came that way. Both for the Master and for the disciples there
   was always a table, a bed, and a candlestick in the prophet's chamber,
   and sometimes sumptuous feasts were prepared for the whole company.
   They were very happy, and rejoiced much to think that they could be
   serviceable to the necessities of one so poor, and yet so honoured as
   the Lord Jesus. But, alas! affliction cometh everywhere; virtue may
   sentinel the door, but grief is not to be excluded from the homestead.
   "Man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward;" if the fuel be a
   log of sweet-smelling sandal wood, yet the sparks must rise, and even
   so the best of families must feel affliction. Lazarus sickens. It is a
   mortal sickness beyond the power of physicians. What is the first
   thought of the sisters but to send for their friend Jesus? They know
   that one word from His lips will restore their brother: there is no
   absolute need that He should even risk His safety by a journey to
   Bethany; He has but to speak the word and their brother shall be made
   whole. With glowing hopes and moderated anxieties, they send a tender
   message to Jesus--"Lord, behold, he whom Thou lovest is sick." Jesus
   hears it, and sends back the answer which had much comfort in it, but
   could hardly compensate for His own absence: "This sickness is not unto
   death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified
   thereby." There lies poor Lazarus after the message is come; he does
   not recover; he is a little more cheerful, because he hears that his
   sickness is not unto death, but his pains do not abate; the clammy
   death-sweat gathers on his brow; his tongue is dry; he is full of pains
   and racked with anguish, at last he passes through the iron gate of
   death, and there lies his corpse before the weeping sisters' eyes. Why
   was not Jesus there? Why did He not come? Tender hearted as He always
   was, what could have made Him thus unkind? Why tarrieth He so? Why is
   He so long in coming? How can His words be true? He said, "This
   sickness is not unto death"; and there lies the good man cold in death,
   and the mourners are gathering for the funeral. Look at Martha! She has
   been sitting up every night watching her poor brother; no care could
   have been more constant, no tenderness more excessive. There is no
   potion in the range of her housewifery which she has not compounded;
   this herb and the other she has gathered, and she has administered all
   sorts of medicinal drinks and nourishing foods; and anxiously has she
   watched until her eyes are red for want of sleep. Jesus might have
   spared her all this. Why did He not? He had only to will it, and the
   flush of health would have returned to the cheek of Lazarus, and there
   would have been no more need of this weary nursing, and this killing
   watchfulness. What is Jesus doing? Martha was willing to serve Him,
   will He not serve her? She has even cumbered herself about much-serving
   for His sake, giving Him not only necessaries but dainties, and will He
   not give her what is so desirable to her heart, so essential to her
   happiness--her brother's life? How is it He can send her a promise
   which He doth not seem to keep, and tantalize her with hope, and cast
   down her faith? As for Mary, she has been sitting still at her
   brother's side, listening to his dying words, repeating in his ear the
   gracious words of Jesus which she had been wont to hear when she sat at
   His feet, catching the last accents of her expiring brother, thinking
   less about the medicine and about the diet than Martha did, but
   thinking more about his spiritual health and about his soul's
   enjoyment. She has endeavoured to stay the sinking spirits of her
   beloved brother with words like these, "He will come; He may wait, but
   I know Him, His heart is very kind, He will come at the last; and even
   if He let thee sleep in death it will be but for a little; He raised
   the widow's son at the gates of Nain, He will surely raise thee whom He
   loves far more. Have ye not heard how He wakened the daughter of
   Jairus? Brother, He will come and quicken thee, and we shall have many
   happy hours yet, and we shall have this as a special love-token from
   our Master and our Lord, that He raised thee from the dead." But why,
   why was she not spared those bitter tears which ran scalding down her
   cheeks when she saw that her brother was really dead? She could not
   believe it. She kissed his forehead, and oh! how cold was that marble
   brow! She lifted up his hand--"He cannot be dead," said she, "for Jesus
   said this sickness was not unto death;" but the hand fell nerveless by
   her side: her brother was really a corpse, and putrefaction soon set
   in, and then she knew that the beloved clay was not exempt from all the
   dishonour which decay brings to the human body. Poor Mary! Jesus loved
   thee, it is said, but this is a strange way of showing His love. Where
   is He? Miles away He lingers. He knows thy brother is sick; yea, He
   knows that he is dead, and yet He abides still where He is. Oh!
   sorrowful mystery that the pity of such a tender Saviour should sink so
   far below their plumb-line to gauge, or His mercy should range so high
   beyond their power to reach.

   Jesus is talking of the death of His friend, let us listen to His
   words; perhaps we may find the key to His actions in the words of His
   lips. How surprising! He does not say, "I regret that I have tarried so
   long." He does not say, "I ought to have hastened, but even now it is
   not too late." Hear, and marvel! Wonder of wonders, He says, "I am glad
   that I was not there." Glad! the word is out of place? Lazarus, by this
   time, stinketh in his tomb, and here is the Saviour glad! Martha and
   Mary are weeping their eyes out for sorrow, and yet their friend Jesus
   is glad! It is strange, it is passing strange! However, we may rest
   assured that Jesus knoweth better than we do, and our faith may
   therefore sit still and try to spell out His meaning, where our reason
   cannot find it at the first glance. "I am glad," saith He, "for your
   sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe." Ah! we see
   it now: Christ is not glad because of sorrow, but only on account of
   the result of it. He knew that this temporary trial would help His
   disciples to a greater faith, and He so prizes their growth in faith
   that He is even glad of the sorrow which occasions it. He does as good
   as say, "I am glad for your sakes that I was not there to prevent the
   trouble, for now that it is come, it will teach you to believe in me,
   and this shall be much better for you than to have been spared the
   affliction."

   We have thus plainly before us the principle, that our Lord in His
   infinite wisdom and superabundant love, sets so high a value upon His
   people's faith, that He will not screen them from those trials by which
   faith is strengthened. Let us try to press the wine of consolation from
   the cluster of the text. In three cups we will preserve the goodly
   juice as it flows forth from the winepress of meditation. First of all,
   brethren, Jesus Christ was glad that the trial had come, for the
   strengthening of the faith of the apostles; secondly, for strengthening
   the faith of the family; and thirdly, for giving faith to others; for
   you find by the forty-fifth verse that the goblet passed round to
   sympathizing friends--"Many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had
   seen the things which Jesus did, believed on Him."

   I. Jesus Christ designed the death of Lazarus and his
   after-resurrection FOR THE STRENGTHENING OF THE FAITH OF THE APOSTLES.
   This acted two ways: not only would the trial itself tend to strengthen
   their faith; but the remarkable deliverance which Christ gave to them
   out of it would certainly minister to the growth of their confidence in
   Him.

   1. Let us at once observe that the trial itself would certainly tend to
   increase the apostle's faith. Faith untried may be true faith, but it
   is sure to be little faith. I believe in the existence of faith in men
   who have no trials, but that is as far as I can go. I am persuaded,
   brethren, that where there is no trial faith just draws breath enough
   to live, but that is all; for faith, like the fabled salamander, has
   fire for its native element. Faith never prospers so well as when all
   things are against her: tempests are trainers, and the lightnings are
   her illuminators. When a calm reigns on the sea, spread the sails as
   you will, the ship moves not to its harbour; for on a slumbering ocean
   the keel sleeps too. Let the winds come howling forth, and let the
   waters lift up themselves, then, though the vessel may rock, and her
   deck may be washed with waves, and her mast may creak under the
   pressure of the full and swelling sail, yet it is then that she makes
   headway towards her desired haven. No flowers wear so lovely a blue as
   those which grow at the foot of the frozen glacier; no stars so bright
   as those which glisten in the polar sky; no water so sweet as that
   which springs amid the desert sand; and no faith so precious as that
   which lives and triumphs in adversity. Thus saith the Lord, by the
   mouth of the prophet, "I will leave in the midst of thee an afflicted
   and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the Lord." Now,
   why afflicted and poor? Because there is an adaptation in the afflicted
   and poor among the Lord's people, to trust in the Lord. He does not
   say, "I will leave in the midst of thee a prosperous and rich people,
   and they shall trust." No! these scarcely seem to have such capacity
   for faith as the afflicted ones have. Rather I will leave in the midst
   of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they, by reason of their very
   affliction and poverty, shall be the more graciously disposed to repose
   their faith in the Lord. Untried faith is always small in stature; and
   it is likely to remain dwarfish so long as it is without trials. There
   is no room in the placid pools of ease for faith to gain leviathan
   proportions, she must dwell in the stormy sea if she would be one of
   the chief of the ways of God. Tried faith brings experience; and every
   one of you who are men and women of experience, must know that
   experience makes religion become more real to you. You never know
   either the bitterness of sin or the sweetness of pardon, till you have
   felt both. You never know your own weakness till you have been
   compelled to go through the rivers, and you would never have known
   God's strength had you not been supported amid the water-floods. All
   the talk about religion which is not based upon an experience of it, is
   mere talk. If we have little experience, we cannot speak so positively
   as those can whose experience has been more deep and profound. Once
   when I was preaching upon the faithfulness of God in time of trial in
   the earlier days of my ministry, my venerable grandfather was sitting
   in the pulpit behind me; he suddenly rose up and took my place, and
   coming to the front of the pulpit, said, "My grandson can preach this
   as a matter of theory, but I can tell you it as a matter of experience,
   for I have done business upon the great waters, and have seen the works
   of the Lord for myself." There is an accumulation of force in the
   testimony of one who has personally passed through the things whereof
   others can only speak as though they had seen them in a map or in a
   picture. Travellers who write from their easy chairs what they have
   seen from their bedchambers, may indite books to beguile the idle hours
   of those who stay at home; but he who is about to traverse regions full
   of danger, seeks a guide who has really trodden the road, The writer
   may excel in florid words, the veritable traveller has real and
   valuable wisdom. Faith increases in solidity, assurance, and intensity,
   the more she is exercised with tribulation, and the more she hath been
   cast down, and lifted up again. Let not this, however, discourage those
   who are young in faith. You will have trials enough without your
   seeking for them; the full portion will be measured out to you in due
   season. Meanwhile, if you cannot yet claim the result of long
   experience, thank God for what grace you have. Praise Him for that
   whereunto you have attained; walk according to that rule, and you shall
   yet have more and more of the blessing of God, till your faith shall
   remove mountains, and conquer impossibilities.

   It may be asked, what is the method by which trial strengthens faith?
   We might answer in various ways. Trial takes away many of the
   impediments of faith. Carnal security is the worst foe to confidence in
   God. If I sit down and say, "Soul, take thine ease, thou hast much
   goods laid up for many years;" faith's road is barricaded, but
   adversity sets the barn on a blaze, and "the much goods laid up for
   many years," cease to block up the path of faith. Oh, blessed axe of
   sorrow, which clears a pathway for me to my God by cutting down the
   thick trees of my earthly comforts! When I say, "My mountain standeth
   firm, I shall never be moved," the visible fortification, rather than
   the invisible protector, engages my attention; but when the great
   earthquake shakes the rocks, and the mountain is swallowed up, I fly to
   the immovable Rock of Ages to build my confidence on high. Worldly ease
   is a great foe to faith; it loosens the joints of holy valour, and
   snaps the sinews of scared courage. The balloon never rises until the
   cords are cut: affliction doth this sharp service for believing souls.
   While the wheat sleeps comfortable in the husk it is useless to man, it
   must be threshed out of its resting-place before its value can be
   known. Trial plucks the arrow of faith from the repose of the quiver,
   and shoots it against the foe.

   Nor is affliction of small service to faith, when it exposes the
   weakness of the creature. This trial would show the apostles that they
   must not depend upon the bounty of any one man, for though Lazarus may
   have entertained them and filled their little bag with food, yet
   Lazarus dies, and Mary may die, and Martha may die, and all friends
   must die, and this would teach them not to look to broken cisterns, but
   to fly to the ever-flowing fountain. Oh, dear friends, we are in much
   danger of making idols of our mercies! God gives us his temporal
   favours as refreshments by the way, and then straightway we kneel down
   and cry, "These by thy gods, O Israel." It is of the Lord's mercy that
   these idol-gods be broken in pieces. He blasts the gourds under which
   we sat in ample shade, in order that we may lift up our cry to Him, and
   trust in Him alone. The emptiness of the creature is a lesson we are so
   slow to learn, and we must have it whipped into us by the rod of
   affliction; but learned it must be, or else faith can never attain to
   eminence.

   Furthermore, trial is of special service to faith when it drives her to
   her God. I make a sad confession, over which I mourn, that when my soul
   is happy and things prosper, I do not as a rule live so near to God as
   I do in the midst of shame and contempt, and casting down of spirit. O
   my God, how dear Thou art to my soul in the night; when the sun goeth
   down, Thou Bright and Morning Star, how sweetly dost Thou shine. When
   the world's bread is sugared and buttered, then we devour it till we
   grow sick; but when the world changes our diet, fills our mouth with
   vinegar, and makes our drink gall and wormwood, then we cry for the
   breasts of our dear God again. When the world's wells are full of sweet
   but poisonous water, we pitch our tents at the well's mouth, and drink
   again and again and forget the well of Bethlehem which is within the
   gate; but when earth's water becomes bitter like the stream of Marah,
   then we turn away all sick and faint, and cry after the water of life,
   "Spring up, O well!" Thus afflictions fetch us to our God, as the
   barking dog drives the wandering sheep to the shepherd's hand.

   And then trial has a hardening effect upon faith. As the Spartan lads
   were prepared for fighting by the sharp discipline of their boyish
   days, so are God's servants trained for war by the afflictions which He
   sends upon them in the early days of their spiritual life. We must run
   with footmen, or we shall never be able to contend with horses; we must
   be thrown into the water, or we shall never learn to swim; we must hear
   the whizzing of the bullets, or we shall never become veteran soldiers.
   The gardener knows that if his flowers were kept always under glass and
   fostered in a great temperature, when he might put them out, should
   there come a cold night they would quickly die; so he does not give
   them too much heat, but exposes them by degrees and gets them used to
   the cold, that they may stand in the open air; and thus the only wise
   God does not put His servants in hothouses and rear them delicately,
   but He exposes them to trial that they may know how to bear it when it
   comes. If you want to ruin your son, never let him know a hardship.
   When he is a child carry him in your arms, when he becomes a youth
   still dandle him, and when he becomes a man still dry-nurse him, and
   you will succeed in producing an arrant fool. If you want to prevent
   his being made useful in the world, guard him from every kind of toil.
   Do not suffer him to struggle. Wipe the sweat from his dainty brow and
   say, "Dear child, thou shalt never have another task so arduous." Pity
   him when he ought to be punished; supply all his wishes, avert all
   disappointments, prevent all troubles, and you will surely tutor him to
   be a reprobate and to break your heart. But put him where he must work,
   expose him to difficulties, purposely throw him into peril, and in this
   way you shall make him a man, and when he comes to do man's work and to
   bear man's trial, he shall be fit for either. My Master does not
   daintily cradle His children when they ought to run alone; and when
   they begin to run He is not always putting out His finger for them to
   lean upon, but He lets them tumble down to the cutting of their knees,
   because then they will walk more carefully by-and-by, and learn to
   stand upright by the strength which faith confers upon them.

   You see, dear friends, that Jesus Christ was glad--glad that His
   disciples were blessed by trouble. Will you think of this, you who are
   so troubled this morning, Jesus Christ does sympathize with you, but
   still He does it wisely, and He says, "I am glad for your sakes that I
   was not there." He is glad that your business does not prosper; He is
   glad that you have those pains and aches, and that you have so weak a
   body, to the intent that you may believe. You would never have
   possessed the precious faith which now supports you if the trial of
   your faith had not been like unto fire. You are a tree that never would
   have rooted so well if the wind had not rocked you to and fro, and made
   you to take firm hold upon the precious truths of the covenant of
   grace.

   2. But not to tarry here, let us notice that the deliverance which
   Christ wrought by the resurrection of Lazarus, was calculated also to
   strengthen the faith of the apostles. At the worst Christ can work.
   Why, what a plight were they now in! Here was a case which had come to
   the very worst. Lazarus is not merely dead--he has been buried; the
   stone has been rolled to the mouth of the sepulchre--worse than that,
   he had become putrid. Here are miracles so many, that I must describe
   the resurrection of Lazarus not as one miracle, but as a mass of
   wonders. We will not go into detail, but suffice it to say, we cannot
   suppose anything to be a more prodigious exhibition of the divine
   strength, than the restoration of health and life to a body through
   which the worms did creep and crawl; and yet in the very worst case
   Christ is not brought to a nonplus. Here was a case where human power
   evidently could do nothing. Now bring the viol and the harp, and let
   music try its charms. Bring here, physician, thy most potent draught,
   now, for the true aqua vitoe! Now see what thou canst do. What! does
   the elixir fail? The physician turns away disgusted, for the stench may
   sooner destroy the physician's life, than he restore the corpse. Now,
   seek ye round the world and ask all men that are--Herod and his
   men-at-arms, and Caesar on the imperial throne--"Can you do anything
   here?" Nay, death sits with ghastly smile laughing at them all. "I have
   Lazarus," says he, "beyond your reach." Yet Jesus Christ wins the day.

   Here divine sympathy became most manifest. Jesus wept when He thought
   of Lazarus and his weeping sisters. We do not find it often said that
   He wept. He was "a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief," but those
   were precious and rare drops which He shed over that dead body. He
   could do no more when He thought of Jerusalem: He doth no less now that
   He thinks of Lazarus.

   What an exhibition these disciples had of the divine power as well as
   the divine sympathy, for Christ does but say, "Lazarus, come forth,"
   and death can hold his captive no longer. Forth from the charnel house
   he comes, restored to perfect health.

   Do you not think that all this must tend to confirm the apostles'
   faith? It seems to me to be a part of the best education they could
   possibly receive for their future ministry. I think I see the apostles
   in after-time shut up in prison: they are condemned to die, but Peter
   comforts John by saying, "He can bring us out of prison: do you not
   remember how He brought Lazarus out of his grave? He can certainly
   appear for us and set us free." When they went forth to preach to
   sinners, how would they be strengthened by remembering these cases!
   Their hearers were debauched, depraved, immoral--the apostles went into
   the midst of the worst conditions of human nature, and yet they feared
   not for the result, for they knew that putrid Lazarus revived at
   Christ's word. Peter would argue, "Did not Christ restore Lazarus when
   his body was stinking and decayed? He can certainly bring the most
   reprobate hearts to the obedience of the truth, and raise the vilest of
   the vile to new life."

   Many of the apostolic Churches were far gone; they had in them unworthy
   members; but this would not too much buffet the faith of the apostles,
   for they would say, "That same Christ Who raised up Lazarus, can make
   Sardis, and Pergamos, and Thyatira, yet to be a praise in the earth,
   and Churches which seem to be corrupt and foul in the nostrils of the
   Most High, may yet be made a brightness and glory, and a sweet-smelling
   savour unto him." I am persuaded that very often such a miracle as this
   would recur to them, and strengthen them in the times of their
   suffering and labour and make them able to bear afflictions, and even
   martyrdom itself, in confidence in Christ.

   I will not, however, say more, because the thing seems obvious enough;
   only you must not forget the principle we are trying to bring out, that
   in the case of the apostles, Christ considered that for them to have
   strong faith was worth any cost. No matter what pangs it cost Mary and
   Martha, or in what grief it might involve Himself or His apostles, they
   must bear it, because the result was so exceedingly beneficial. The
   surgeon handles the knife without tears, sharp is the cut, but he knows
   it will cure. The mother puts the draught to the child's mouth, and the
   child cries, and heaves, and loathes the bitterness, but the mother
   says, "Drink it all up, my child," because she knows there is life in
   every drop. So Christ is glad for the apostles' sake that He is not
   there, to the intent that they may believe.

   II. Jesus Christ had an eye also to THE GOOD OF THE FAMILY. Mary and
   Martha had faith, but it was not very strong, for they suspected
   Christ's love when they said, "Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my
   brother had not died." There was a sort of under whisper--"Why wast
   Thou not here? Dost Thou love us? Wherefore then didst Thou tarry?"
   They certainly doubted His power. Martha, when she could believe in the
   resurrection, but could not believe in the present resurrection for her
   brother; and when again she said, "He has been dead four days," had
   faith, but it was very weak. Christ therefore sent the trial to Mary
   and Martha for their sakes, and was glad to send it, to the intent that
   they might believe.

   Observe, dear friends, that these were choice favourites of the Lord
   Jesus Christ. He loves all the elect. They were three special
   favourites upon whom very distinguishing regard was set, and therefore
   it was that He sent them a special trial. The lapidary, if he takes up
   a stone and finds that it is not very precious, will not spend much
   care in cutting it; but when he gets a rare diamond of the first water,
   then he will be sure to cut, and cut, and cut again. When the Lord
   finds a saint whom He loves--loves much--He may spare other men trials
   and troubles, but He certainly will not this well-beloved one. It is an
   awful thing to be a favourite of heaven. It is a thing to be sought
   after and to be rejoiced in; but remember, to be of the King's
   council-chamber is a thing involving such work for faith that flesh and
   blood might shrink from the painful blessing. The gardener gets a tree,
   and if it is but of a poor sort he will let it grow as it wills, and
   take what fruit comes from it naturally; but if it be of a very rare
   sort, he likes to have every bough in its proper place, so that it may
   bear well; and he often takes out his knife an cuts here and there,
   because, says he, "That is a favourite tree, and it is one which bears
   such fruit that I would have much from it, and would leave nothing
   whatever that would cause it detriment." You who are God's favourites
   must not marvel at trials, but rather keep your door wide open for
   them, and when they come in, say, "Hail, messenger of the King! the
   sound of thy Master's feet is behind thee; thou art welcome here, for
   thy Master sent thee."

   Special trial was attended with a special visit. It may be that Christ
   would not have come to Bethany if Lazarus had not been dead; but as
   soon as there is a corpse in the house, there is Christ in the house
   too. O Christian, it shall be much for your comfort, and for the
   strengthening of your faith, if Christ comes to you in your troubles. I
   tell you, if you see no smiles in His face in your prosperity, you
   shall not be without them in your adversity. The Lord Jesus will go out
   of His way to see you. You know when a mother is most kind to her
   child: she lets it run about, and scarcely notices it when it is well;
   but when it cries. "My head, my head!" and when they take it to the
   mother and tell her it is ill, how tender she is over it! How all the
   blandishments of love and the caresses of affection are lavished upon
   the little sick one! It shall be so with you, and in receiving these
   special visits, you shall know yourself to be highly favoured above the
   rest.

   This special visit was attended with special fellowship. Jesus
   wept--wept with them that wept. Ah! you shall have Jesus sitting by the
   bedside, and weeping with you when you are sick. You may be well, and
   strong, and have but little fellowship with Christ, but He shall make
   all your bed in your sickness. Though you might walk along the green
   sward without the Saviour, when you come into the midst of the fire,
   like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, you shall not be without Him
   then. I witness that there is no fellowship with Christ so near and
   sweet, as that which comes to us when we are in deep trials. Then the
   Master unbosoms Himself, and takes His child, not upon His knee, but to
   His very heart, and bids him lay his head upon His beating bosom.
   Christ will reveal His secrets to you when the world is against you,
   and trials surround you. "The secret of the Lord is with them that fear
   Him; and He will shew them His covenant;" but they shall never have
   such discoveries of that secret and that covenant, as when they most
   need it, in the darkest and most trying times. There are special loves,
   special trials, special visits, and special fellowship.

   And soon you shall have special deliverance. In days to come you will
   talk about these trials. You will say, I fretted myself, and worried
   over it, but oh, if I could have seen the end as well as the beginning,
   I should have said--

   "Sweet affliction! sweet affliction!

   Thus to bring my Saviour near."

   I tell you, you will sit yet under your own vine, and under your own
   fig-tree, and talk to the poor tried saints, and say, "Do not be cast
   down, for I cried unto the Lord and He heard me, and delivered me from
   all my fears." Perhaps in heaven this will help to make a part of your
   happiness, to remember God's love to you in your tribulations--

   "There on a green and flowery mount

   Our weary souls shall sit,

   And with transporting joys recount,

   The labours of our feet."

   Shall we not tell to angels, and principalities, and powers, the
   faithfulness of Christ? We will tell all heaven that "His love was
   strong as death, and His jealousy as cruel as the grave" "many waters
   could not quench His love, neither could the floods drown it." What
   sayest thou, my friend, thou who are under the smarting rod? Wilt thou
   murmur any more? Wilt thou repine against it any more? I beseech you,
   rather take my text, and read it the other way say--God help thee to
   say it--"I am glad that my God did not deliver me, because the trial
   has strengthened my faith. I thank His name that He has done me the
   great favour to permit me to carry the heavy end of His cross. I thank
   my Father that He hath not left me unchastised, for Before I was
   afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept Thy word.' It is good for
   me that I have been afflicted.' " I tell you, this is the shortest way
   out of your troubles, as well as the most profitable spirit while you
   are in them. The Lord generally stays the rod when He finds His child
   receiving it as a favour. When thou art agreed with God's rod, then
   that rod will have no further quarrel with thee. When thou canst look
   into the Father's eyes, and say, "Thy will be done," then His
   afflicting hand has done its work.

   III. Now I come to the third point, and here may God the Holy Spirit
   bless the word. This trouble was permitted for GIVING FAITH TO OTHERS.

   I shall address myself chiefly to those who cannot say they are God's
   people, but who have some desire towards Christ. It is very likely you
   have had some great trouble in your life, and looking back, you wish
   you had never had it; but my Lord, who knows better than you do, says
   "I am glad for your sakes that I did not spare you that trouble, to the
   intent that you may be led to believe." Know assuredly that afflictions
   often lead men to faith in Christ because they give space for thought.
   The man was strong and hale and hearty, and went on working from day to
   day, and never had a thought about God. "The ox knoweth his owner, and
   the ass his master's crib;" but he did not know, he did not care. He
   left all thoughts of eternity to those who were silly enough to be
   religious, but for him--what did it matter to him? Death was a long way
   off, and besides, if it were not, he had not the time to think about
   it. An accident occurred; he had to lie upon his bed, and at first he
   fretted and fumed, but it could not be altered, and there in the ward
   of the hospital he groaned through many a weary hour at night. What
   could he think of? Why then the man began to think of himself, of his
   condition before God, of what would be his lot if he should die. When
   his life trembled like the even balance, and not one could tell which
   way it would turn, the man was forced to consider. Many a soul has been
   ploughed in the hospital, and then has been sown in the sanctuary. Many
   a man has been first brought to God by the loss of a limb, or by long
   sickness, or by deep poverty.

   Afflictions lead men to faith full often by preventing sin. A young man
   had resolved to climb a mountain: he had determined against good advice
   to reach the summit, though one far older than himself had warned him
   of the danger. He had not proceeded far up the mountainside before a
   thick mist surrounded him. He was alarmed. The mist was so thick he
   could scarcely see his own hand. He retraced his steps following the
   way by which he came, and returned sorrowfully to his father's house,
   telling him that he had been in great peril. His father said he was
   glad of it; for if he had not met with that peril, he might have
   advanced a little farther, and fallen, never to rise again. Often
   trouble puts men out of temptation. They would have gone into bad
   company, to drunkenness, or lust, but they could not. The appointment
   was made--ah! the very night was set apart, but the black hand of God's
   kind angel came--I said a black hand, for so it seemed, and the man
   could not do what he had wished to do, and so his course was checked,
   and this in the hand of God was the means of bringing him to faith.

   Troubles, again, often bring men to believe in Jesus because they
   compel them to stand face to face with stern realities. Did you ever
   lie upon the edge of death for a week? Did you ever lie with your body
   racked with pains, listening for the physician's whispers, and knowing
   that they amounted to this, that there were ninety-nine chances to one
   that you could not possibly recover? Did you ever feel that death was
   near? Did you ever peer into eternity with anxious eyes? Did you ever
   picture hell and think yourself there? Did you ever lie awake, and
   think of heaven and yourself shut out of it? Ah! it is in such times as
   these that God's Holy Spirit works great things for the sons of men.
   Hence Christ is glad when they are brought very low, when their soul
   abhorreth all manner of meat, and they cry unto God in their trouble.
   He is glad because this is the stepping-stone to real and genuine trust
   in Him, and so to eternal life. It is much better to lose an eye or a
   hand than to lose your soul--better to go to heaven poor and ragged,
   than to go to hell rich--better to melt into heaven by the process of
   consumption than it were to go down to hell with bones filled with
   marrow, and sinews full of strength. Glory be to God for the trials and
   troubles some of us have had, if they have been the means of bringing
   us to Christ.

   Trials tend to make men believe in Christ when they are followed by
   deliverances. Perhaps some of you have been raised from a sick bed, or
   you have been helped over a time of temporal distress. Well, have you
   no gratitude? Do you not love God for His goodness? Does not your heart
   melt towards the Lord, for the kind deeds He has done to you? Have you
   no song of praise for His name? I have known many who have said, "Now
   that God has been pleased to raise me up and help me in this way, I
   will give Him my heart; what can I do for Him who has done so much for
   me?" Gratitude, I doubt not, has led many to put their trust in Christ.
   Besides, if you sought God and asked for help in time of trouble, and
   He did help you, this will tend to encourage you to pray again. If He
   helped you then, He will help you now; if He spared your life, why will
   He not spare your soul? If God has been pleased to lift you up from the
   grave, why may He not also deliver you from the pit of hell? I bless
   God there are many in this Church who were led to seek the Lord through
   answers to prayer. God was gracious to them in their distress; His
   mercy listened to their prayer; the blessing came, and the result is,
   that they cry unto Him, and will cry as long as they live.

   If once we have prevailed with God, and believing in God we have had
   some deliverance, this I hope will be overruled to make us trust God
   for everything in the future. Remember that the one thing needful for
   eternal life is trusting in the Lord Jesus Christ. I know you will tell
   me you cannot be perfect. No, I know you cannot. You will say, "I have
   many sins; I have done much that is wrong." It is true, most true, but
   he who believeth in the Lord Jesus Christ has his sins forgiven. You
   know the story--Christ came down from heaven and took His people's sins
   upon His own shoulders. When God came forth to smite the sinner,
   Justice said, "Where is he?" and Christ came and stood in the sinner's
   place, and God's sword went through the Saviour's heart. Why? That it
   might never cut nor wound the heart of those for whom Jesus died. Did
   He die for you? He did, if you believe in Him; your faith will be to
   you the evidence that Christ was substitute for you, and oh! if Christ
   suffered for you, you cannot suffer. If God punished Christ He will
   never punish you. If Jesus Christ paid your debts, you are free. Before
   God's throne today, if thou believest, thou art as clear as the angels
   in heaven. Thou are a saved soul if thou art resting upon the atonement
   of Christ, and thou mayst go thy way and sing--

   "Now, freed from sin, I walk at large,

   The Saviour's blood's my full discharge;

   At His dear feet my soul I lay,

   A sinner saved, and homage pay."

   If this be the result of your affliction, Christ may well say, "I am
   glad for your sakes that I was not there to stop the trouble, to the
   intent that ye may believe." May God bring you to faith for Jesus'
   sake. Amen.

                           The Child Samuel'S Prayer

   A SERMON DELIVERED BY THE REV. C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN
   TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Speak, Lord; for Your servant hears." 1 Samuel 3:9.

   IN the days of Eli the Word of the Lord was precious and there was no
   open vision. It was well, when the Word did come, that one chosen
   individual had the hearing ear to receive it and the obedient heart to
   perform it. Eli failed to tutor his sons to be the willing servants and
   the attentive hearers of the Lord's Word. In this he was without the
   excuse of inability since he successfully trained the child Samuel in
   reverent attention to the Divine will. O that those who are diligent
   about the souls of others would look well to their own households!

   Alas, poor Eli, like many in our day, you are made the keeper of the
   vineyards, but your own vineyard you have not kept! As often as he
   looked upon the gracious child, Samuel, he must have felt the
   heartache. When he remembered his own neglected and unchastened sons
   and how they had made themselves vile before all Israel, Samuel was the
   living witness of what Grace can work where children are trained up in
   God's fear. Hophni and Phinehas were sad specimens of what parental
   indulgence will produce in the children of the best of men. Ah, Eli, if
   you had been as careful with your own sons as with the son of Hannah
   they had not been such men of Belial, nor would Israel have abhorred
   the offering of the Lord because of the fornication which those
   priestly reprobates committed at the very door of the tabernacle!

   O for Grace to so nurse our little ones for the Lord that they may hear
   the Lord when He shall be pleased to speak to them! Let us proceed at
   once to consider our short but very suggestive text in four aspects and
   I pray that the Holy Spirit may speak to us through His Word. We shall
   meditate upon this Scripture, first, as the prayer of a little child.
   Secondly, as the cry of an anxious soul. Thirdly, as the prayer of an
   earnest Believer. And fourthly as the spirit of a dying saint.

   I. First of all we shall take our text AS THE PRAYER OF A LITTLE CHILD.
   Samuel was blessed with a gracious father and what is of even more
   importance, he was the child of an eminently holy mother. Hannah was a
   woman of great poetic talent, as appears from her memorable song--"My
   heart rejoices in the Lord, my horn is exalted in the Lord; my mouth is
   enlarged over my enemies, because I rejoiced in Your salvation." The
   soul of poetry lives in every line--a brave but chastened spirit
   breathes in every sentence! Even the Virgin Mary, the most blessed
   among women, could do no other than use expressions of a similar
   import.

   Better still, Hannah was a woman of great prayer. She had been a woman
   of a sorrowful spirit, but her prayers at last returned to her in
   blessing and she had this son given her of the Lord. He was very dear
   to his mother's heart and she, therefore, to show her gratitude and in
   fulfillment of the vow which in her anguish she had vowed unto the
   Lord, would consecrate the best thing she had and presented her son
   before the Lord in Shiloh--a lesson to all godly parents to see to it
   that they dedicate their children unto God. How highly favored shall we
   be if our children shall all be like Isaac-- children of the promise!
   What blessed parents should we be if we saw our children all rise up to
   call the Redeemer blessed!

   It has been the lot of some of you to see all your children numbered
   with the people of God--all your jewels are now in Jehovah's casket. In
   their early childhood you gave them up to God and dedicated them to Him
   in earnest prayer and now the Lord has given you your petition which
   you asked of Him. I like our friends to hold little services in their
   own houses when their family is increased. It seems good and profitable
   for friends to assemble and prayer to be offered that the child may be
   an inheritor of the promises--that he may be early called by mighty
   Grace and received into the Divine family.

   You will perceive, dear Friends, that as Samuel was put under the care
   and tuition of Eli, Eli had instructed him in some degree in the spirit
   of religion. But he does not appear to have explained to him the
   peculiar form and nature of those special and particular manifestations
   of God which were given to His Prophets. Little dreaming, I dare say,
   that Samuel would ever be, himself, the subject of them. On that
   memorable night, when towards morning the lamp of God was about to go
   out, the Lord cried, "Samuel, Samuel." The young child was not able to
   discern--for he had not been taught--that it was the voice of God and
   not the voice of man.

   That he had learned the spirit of true religion is indicated by his
   instantaneous obedience and the habit of obedience became a valuable
   guide to him in the perplexities of that eventful hour. He runs to Eli
   and says, "Here am I, for you did call me." And though this is three
   times repeated, yet he seems not at all loath to leave his warm bed and
   run to his foster-father to see if he could get him any comfort that
   his old age might require during the night, or otherwise do his
   bidding. This was a sure sign that the child had acquired the healthy
   principle of obedience though he did not understand the mystery of the
   prophetic call.

   Better far to have the young heart trained to bear the yoke than to
   fill the childish head with knowledge, however valuable. An ounce of
   obedience is better than a ton of learning. When Eli perceived that God
   had called the child, he taught him his first little prayer. It is a
   very short one, but it is a very full one--"Speak, Lord; for Your
   servant hears." Many questions have been raised as to whether children
   ought to be taught a form of prayer. As far as I can judge I think not,
   for I do not think that forms of prayer, although they may be allowed
   and God may accept them, are ever of very great advantage to those who
   use them.

   Forms of prayer are something like the stilts of a cripple. If a man
   begins with them, it is very probable that he will never be able to do
   without them. They resemble the copious notes and manuscripts of
   certain ministers who began with them and are quite unable, now, to
   preach without them. Children who are taught a form of prayer may,
   perhaps, by Divine Grace be enabled to use the form in all sincerity of
   heart--I hope they may. But I think they are more likely to understand
   the things of God if, instead of teaching them the form, you explain to
   them the meaning and the value of prayer.

   I take this to be the best plan. Let the Christian parent explain to
   the child what prayer is--tell him that God answers prayer. Direct him
   to the Savior and then urge him to express his desires in his own
   language, both when he rises and when he goes to rest. Gather the
   little ones around your knee and listen to their words, suggesting to
   them their needs and reminding them of God's gracious promises. You
   will be amazed and, I may add, sometimes amused, too. But you will be
   frequently surprised at the expressions they will use, the confessions
   they will make, the desires they will utter. And I am certain that any
   Christian person standing within earshot and listening to the simple
   prayer of a little child earnestly asking God for what it thinks it
   wants, would never afterwards wish to teach a child a form, but would
   say that as a matter of education to the heart the extemporaneous
   utterance was infinitely superior to the best form and that the form
   should be given up forever.

   However, do not let me speak too sweepingly. If you must teach your
   child to say a form of prayer, at least take care that you do not teach
   him to say anything which is not true. If you teach your children a
   catechism, mind that it is thoroughly scriptural, or you may train them
   up to tell falsehoods. Do not call the child up and command him to say,
   "in my Baptism, wherein I was made a member of Christ, a child of God
   and an inheritor of Heaven." If you want to educate him for the
   gallows, teach him to utter untruths about sacred things! If you would
   make him an habitual deceiver, teach him the Church Catechism and make
   him say, "God the Holy Spirit, who sanctifies me and all the elect
   people of God"-- when he is altogether unsanctified and has no evidence
   of being elected.

   I pray you, if you would have honest children, do not teach them to say
   that he thanks his heavenly Father, "who has brought him into this
   state of salvation," when he knows--and you know--that he is not saved
   at all. Teach him nothing but the Truth as it is in Jesus so far as he
   can learn it, and pray the Holy Spirit to write that Truth of God upon
   his heart. Better to supply no signposts to the young traveler than to
   mislead him with false ones. The light of a wrecker's beacon is worse
   than darkness. Teach our youth to make untruthful statements in
   religions matters and Atheism can scarcely do more to corrupt their
   minds!

   Formal religion is a deadly foe to vital godliness. If you teach a
   catechism, or if you teach a form of prayer to your little ones, let it
   all be true. And, as far as possible never put into a child's mouth a
   word which the child cannot truly say from his heart. Dear Friends, we
   must be more careful about truthfulness and correctness in speech. If a
   child looked out of a window at anything going on in the street and
   then told you that he saw it from the door, you ought to make him tell
   the tale over again so as to impress upon him the necessity of being
   truthful in every respect. Especially in things connected with religion
   keep your child back from any form until he has a right to be a
   partaker of it. Never encourage him to come to the Lord's Table unless
   you really believe that there is a work of Grace in his heart--for why
   should you lead him to eat and drink his own damnation?

   Insist with all your heart that religion is a solemn reality not to be
   mimicked or pretended to and seek to bring the child to understand that
   there is no vice more abhorrent before God than hypocrisy. Do not make
   your young Samuel a young hypocrite, but train up your darling to speak
   before the Lord with a deep solemnity and a conscientious truthfulness!
   And let him never dare to say, either in answer to a catechism
   question, or as a form of prayer, anything which is not positively
   true. If you must have a form of prayer, let it not express such
   desires as a child never had, but let it be adapted to his young
   capacity.

   At the same time, I would again say that it would be infinitely better
   to leave the child alone as to the words, having earnestly inculcated
   upon him the spirit of prayer. Beloved, when we see any trace of good
   in our youth, then, like Eli, we should be the more earnest to have
   them trained up in the faith. Let the child learn the Assembly's
   Catechism, even though he does not understand all that is in it--and as
   soon as the young heart can comprehend the things of Jesus, labor in
   power of the Holy Spirit to bring it to a simple dependence upon the
   great Sacrifice.

   It is said of the Rev. John Angell James, "Like most men who have been
   eminent and honored in the Church of Christ, he had a godly mother who
   would take her children to her chamber and with each, separately, pray
   for the salvation of their souls. This exercise, which fulfilled her
   own responsibility, was molding the character of her children, and
   most, if not all of them, rose up to call her blessed. When did such
   means ever fail?"

   I beseech you, the teachers of the Sunday school--though I scarcely
   need to do so, for I know how zealous you are in this matter--as soon
   as ever you see the first peep of day in your children, encourage their
   young desires. Believe in the conversion of children, as children!
   Believe that the Lord can call them by His Grace, can renew their
   hearts, can give them a part and a lot among His people long before
   they reach the prime of life. Oh, that the Lord may give us to see many
   Samuels added to this Church, as we have seen them in days gone by!

   You that are little ones, when the Lord speaks to you, cry to Him,
   "Speak, Lord; for Your servant hears." And when in the class, or here
   in the Tabernacle, the Word of God is preached to sinners, remember it
   is preached to you quite as much as to the men who are six feet high.
   And do lift up your little hearts to God with the desire that while we
   are preaching, God would speak to you. Do, dear children, expect the
   Lord to meet with you. Boys and girls have been saved--

   "Many dear children are gathering there, For of such is the kingdom of
   Hea ven." We have baptized many like you, at twelve, thirteen and
   fourteen years of age who have made a very clear profession of their
   faith. And rejoiced, indeed, shall we be if we see you boys and girls
   coming forward and saying, "God has called us, has brought us to put
   our trust in Jesus. And here we are."

   Young Samuel, the Lord calls you! And you are a privileged one to be
   called so soon, for early Grace frequently becomes eminent Grace! And
   those who begin early with God are often preserved in this world to be
   of distinguished service in the courts of the Lord's House. May that be
   your lot and mine!

   II. We have perhaps spoken enough upon this point. Let us now consider
   the words as THE CRY OF AN ANXIOUS SOUL. What an overwhelming sight is
   this vast crowd of immortal souls! What a joy would it be to me if I
   could hope that you were all anxious to find the Savior! Many of you
   who assemble constantly within these walls, though you have had serious
   impressions, are not yet saved. As you came in tonight this thought may
   have been uppermost--"Oh, that God would meet with my soul tonight."

   Some of you young woman have been in my Sister's, Mrs. Bartlett's
   class, this afternoon and it is very hard to be in that class long
   without receiving solemn impressions. God has been visiting your class
   just lately. He has removed a heavenly-minded and well-beloved Sister.
   He has carried her aloft to the upper and better world. She could die
   singing and rejoicing in her Savior, for her usual frame of mind was
   set forth in these words, "Speak, Lord; for Your servant hears."

   Well, dear Friends, this bereaving Providence has had a loud voice to
   your class! God has worked a solemn impression upon your minds by it
   and you prayed as you entered the Tabernacle, "O God, save my soul this
   night!" Let me recommend to you the use of this simple prayer now while
   you are sitting in the pew, "Speak, Lord; for Your servant hears."
   "Speak, Lord!" Pray that first. "Speak, Lord! While the minister is
   speaking, Lord, speak! I have heard the min- ister's voice and
   sometimes it awakens me, but I am not saved and I never shall be, Lord,
   if the minister speaks alone. Speak, Lord! My mother has talked with
   me. My earnest teacher has sought to lead me to the Savior. But I know
   that the words of blessed men and women will fall to the ground if they
   come alone. Speak, Lord!

   "Your voice said, 'Let there be light,' and there was light. Speak,
   Lord! And make light in my darkened mind! Your voice called Lazarus
   from the grave though he had been dead four days. Speak, Lord! And make
   me live! Oh, let it be tonight a real work of Grace in my soul! Let
   Divine power come and operate upon me." My dear Friend, cannot you
   follow me in such petitions as these? You know my soul is going up for
   you and I am crying to God, "Speak, Lord!" And there are others here
   that you know of and who are dear to you who are even now wrestling in
   earnest with the angel of mercy and they are saying, "Speak, Lord!" Oh,
   what would your father give if he should hear that God had spoken to
   your soul? How would your mother leap for joy if she did but know that
   God had come to deal with you in a way of saving Grace! "Speak, Lord!"
   Let that be your prayer!

   Then put it next, "Speak, Lord, to me! For if the Lord speaks in a
   sermon, it may be to another and then woe is me that I should be denied
   the priceless gift. I may be lying by Bethesda's pool, but another man
   may step in before me and I may miss the mercy. Speak, Lord, to me,
   even to me. Say unto my soul, 'I am your salvation.' May there be an
   unmistakable message to my heart. You have taken away one that I knew.
   It is a marvel, then, that You have not taken me away. It is a wonder
   that I am spared--such a rebel as I have been!

   "O how great is Your patience that You have not dashed me in pieces and
   cast me into Hell! Lord, You have dealt graciously with me in sparing
   my life. Speak to me, Lord. If there are other souls in a like case
   with me, deal graciously with them, but oh, do chiefly so with me, for
   if there is one heart that wants You more than another I am that one!
   If there is one less likely than another to be saved--one who would
   give You more praise than another if saved--I am that one! Lord, speak
   to me!"

   Dear young friend, you need not go home to pray that prayer. While you
   are sitting there, I pray God the Holy Spirit to lead you to offer it
   in silence--"Lord, speak to me." Personal possession of an interest in
   Christ Jesus is a blessing to be sought for with strong crying and
   tears--be not silent till the God of Heaven shall grant it to you. I
   will add another word to the prayer which I commend to you--it shall be
   the word of time. "Lord, speak to me now." How old are you? Perhaps you
   are young. Oh, but how well it is to let the Savior have the bud of our
   being--to consecrate to Him the early morning of life!

   Blessed is the day of life when it begins with clear shining and opens
   with a morning without clouds. "Lord, I am young, but not too young to
   die. Speak to me now!" But are there not some of you who are past your
   one-and-twenty and are beginning to run into the ways of sin? It may be
   your feet have slipped. Have you wandered into evil? Are you living in
   the daily practice of outward vice? You know you have left the right
   path, some of you, and the pangs of conscience are upon you just now.
   Pray--"Lord, let me have had the last of my sins! Let me have done with
   them now. Sever, once and for all, the bonds between me and Satan and
   bind me fast to Your altar tonight!"

   Perhaps you have passed even the prime of life. It may be that your
   hairs are turning gray. An old sinner is an old fool. He who is out of
   Christ at sixty or seventy is devoid of understanding. The young may
   die, but the old must. To be careless in youth is to sleep in a siege.
   But to be worldly in old age is to sleep in an attack, when already the
   scaling ladders are at the walls! Take heed, you who wear gray hairs,
   for if they are not crowns of Glory to you, they will prove to be
   fools' caps! Woe unto you who have spent your threescore years and ten
   and are yet the enemies of God! What will you do when He comes to
   require of you that which is past?

   O, what will you do in the day when He shall deal out to you who have
   followed the flesh, the corruption thereof? O, what will you do when
   the heavens are in a blaze and the trumpet rings and the dead awaken
   and you are judged? I put this question to you in deep solemnity this
   night. And do, I pray you, before you leave these walls, send up the
   cry, "Speak, Lord to me and speak to me NOW!"

   But can you say, like Samuel, "Your servant hears"? Truly, I am afraid
   many of you cannot for you do not hear God's word with your hearts. My
   eye runs down with grief when I think of some of you who listen to my
   voice year after year and yet do not hear. You hear me, but you do not
   hear my Master! Alas, how many have been the arrows out of God's bow
   which I have shot at you? Have they not been wasted? They have rattled
   upon your armor, but they have not pierced your hearts! I have run in
   vain! I have labored in vain for you! I have beaten the air so far as
   you are concerned.

   You would not hear. I can say solemnly I have sometimes stood in this
   pulpit and have labored with your souls to the best of my power and I
   have felt that I would have cheerfully resigned all I had on earth if I
   might but have brought you to Christ!

   If you, my Hearers who sit here constantly, might but be partakers of
   eternal life, I will leave my Master to do what He wills with me.
   Shame, contempt, disgrace--these shall be our joy and our crown for our
   faithfulness to God and your souls. But, oh, I must have you saved! I
   must have you lay hold on eternal life! I must see you look to Jesus!
   And my prayer is that you may this night look to a Savior Crucified!
   Can you say, "Your servant hears"? "Yes," says one, "I can. If now the
   Lord would say a word in mercy to me I would gladly hear it." Then He
   will speak to you, poor Soul, before long. If you will hear it, He will
   say it, for He never did give a hearing ear to any heart without
   intending to speak to it.

   I know how you want Him to speak--you want Him to speak with
   conviction. You want the broken and the contrite heart such as He will
   not despise. Well, ask for it--say, "Speak, Lord, with Your convicting
   voice, for I am ready to hear." And you want Him to speak with a
   converting voice--you desire to be turned from your evil ways and to
   follow the Lord. Cry to Him, then, "Speak, Lord, with the voice that
   turns men and turn me now from darkness to Light."

   Or it may be that you want a comforting word. Well, then, pray for
   it--"Speak, Lord, with Your voice of comfort! Bind up my bleeding
   wounds and let my soul rejoice in You." Yet, truly, I do not know that
   He will speak anything more to you than this--"Look to Christ and
   live." He will speak with power, but that is the substance of it. Jesus
   is the sum of Mercy's message. He is the Word of God. Do not expect to
   have any other Gospel from God's lips than that which is revealed in
   God's Word. The Gospel of God's Word is, "Believe, and live." There is
   life in a look at the Crucified One! There is life at this moment for
   YOU! If you will not hear the voice of God when He says to you, "Trust
   Christ," remember He has no other glad tidings.

   Effectual calling may speak this same thing more effectually, but the
   Holy Spirit never reveals any other Gospel. There is no other way to
   Heaven but just this--"Trust your soul to Christ--your sins are
   forgiven you and you are saved!" I am loath to leave this point because
   my heart is panting to know and to feel some inward emotion which might
   make me feel confident that some of you had breathed this prayer. O may
   the good Master who alone can drive these nails home use the Gospel
   hammer now! I do entreat you, by the shortness of life, by the
   certainty of death, by the glories of Heaven, by the terrors of
   Hell--seek the Lord and let this be, now, the voice of your seeking,
   "Speak, Lord! Speak to ME! Speak NOW! For Your servant hears."

   III. We will turn to the third view of the text as the PRAYER OF AN
   EARNEST BELIEVER. I was led to select this text by finding it in the
   letter of one who has just been taken away from our classes and from
   our Church. She was about to change her position in life in some degree
   and the one prayer that seemed to be ever upon her mind was a prayer
   for guidance. She often prayed, "Speak, Lord; for Your servant hears."
   She said she felt that God was about to do something for her, but she
   did not know what it was. She little dreamed that she was so near the
   kingdom and the Glory, but yet that was the prayer, "Speak, Lord; for
   Your servant hears."

   This is a very appropriate prayer for the Christian when he is in
   providential difficulty. You may not know what you ought to do
   tomorrow. Of two courses open to you, there may appear certain
   advantages connected with each and some friends have urged you to one
   plan and other friends have urged you to the other. Now if you have
   used your best judgment and have endeavored to direct your steps
   according to the Word of God, you may expect, in answer to prayer, to
   have a distinct directive from God. Not, perhaps, from the month of
   man, though that sometimes happens, for even from this pulpit cases
   which we never heard of have been unraveled and dilemmas with which the
   preacher was never acquainted have notwithstanding been solved by what
   seemed but a stray word, meant by God to be a finger, pointing out to
   His children--"This is the way, walk you in it."

   Take your difficulty to the God of Wisdom. Spread it out before Him,
   and having divested yourself of your own will in the matter--having
   solemnly desired to know the will of God and not your own wish--you may
   then expect by some means or other--and God has different ways of doing
   it--to have an answer from the Most High. Take this as your prayer,
   "Speak, Lord; for Your servant hears." We want in our daily life more
   fully to acknowledge God in all our ways. We are, I am afraid, in this
   age, in great danger of forgetting God. We ought to acknowledge Him in
   the common transactions of the day, or else like the Israelites with
   the Gibeonites, we may be betrayed in the simplest transaction and
   deceived to our lasting injury.

   Take your matters before the God of Abraham and the Urim and Thummim
   shall yet speak to you. Domino dirige nos, "Lord direct us," is a good
   motto, not only for the City of London, but for the citizens of Heaven!
   In points of doctrine this desire humbly uttered may bring us much
   light. God's Word is not all of it alike plain! Sometimes when you have
   heard conflicting views--this preacher earnestly declaring a doctrine
   and another denouncing it--you may be somewhat nonplussed. My advice to
   you is take your difficulty before God in prayer and say, "Speak, Lord;
   for Your servant hears."

   Do not ask God to confirm your opinion, but ask Him to make your
   opinion conformable with His Truth. Do not go to God's Word to find
   texts to support your tenets, but go to Scripture for texts and tenets,
   too. Remember that to a true Christian no doctrine has any force upon
   the conscience, except as it comes with, "thus says the Lord." Follow
   the simple Word of God as you find it and rest assured you shall have
   the Light of the Holy Spirit streaming upon the sacred page. And as you
   read it you shall hear the Master say, "This is My Word." He shall make
   it come to your soul with such power that you shall have no doubt about
   it if your heart cries, "Speak, Lord; for Your servant hears."

   The same course should be adopted by every Christian in matters of
   practice. I am afraid there are many Christians who have stopped their
   ears up. They may not hear the teaching of portions of the Word. There
   are certain Scriptures which they can never abide. I have heard of one
   who never would read the eighth or ninth chapter of Romans at family
   prayer. I have heard of another who invariably omitted that chapter in
   Acts about the Ethiopian eunuch--a very awkward chapter, I confess, for
   anyone to read who has not accepted Believer's Baptism.

   You will find many professed Christians in these day's who do not like
   to meddle with certain questions because they are more than half afraid
   that a little examination would prove them to be in the wrong. They
   cannot bear us to put a finger upon their Prayer Book, their creed, or
   their Church for they know that they will not bear a close inspection.
   They will say, "Well, there are faults everywhere, let well enough
   alone." But the fact is that they do not care what the Truth of God is
   so long as they can be comfortable and go with the fashion of the day.

   Some whom we gladly hope to be true Christians think Truth unimportant
   and are not prepared to "search the Scriptures whether these things are
   so or not." Brethren, I would be afraid of my own doctrine if I dared
   not test it both by Scripture and sound argument. If my foundation
   would not stand a good shaking, I would be afraid that it was not made
   of very solid material. Some people cry out if we say a word about
   their Church. It is a sign that their Church is hardly strong enough to
   endure an honest encounter. Pasteboard and tinsel always pray for peace
   and charity, but solid metal fears not the day of battle!

   Be it ours to court the sunlight and above all let us beseech the Lord
   our God to be our light, for in His Light we shall see light. Sitting
   at the feet of Jesus is our position! To receive of His Words is our
   sweet employ! As melted wax is fitted to receive the impression of the
   seal, so let us be ready to accept the Master's teaching. Let His
   faintest Word bind us as with bonds of steel. And let his minutest
   Precept be precious as the gold of Ophir. "To obey is better than
   sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams." Let it be our chosen
   privilege to be taught of the Lord and to maintain His Truth. Here, in
   this House of Prayer, let us offer the petition, "Speak, Lord; for Your
   servant hears."

   As for matters of duty--again, be ever ready to follow the Master and
   Him alone. Not Luther, nor Calvin, neither Wesley, nor Whitfield is to
   be your Rabbi. Jesus alone is Master in the kingdom of Heaven! Whatever
   he says to you, do it! But where you have not His warrant, let no
   traditions or ancient customs make you stir so much as a single inch.

   IV. We will close by observing that our text seems to us rightly to
   express THE SPIRIT OF A DEPARTING CHRISTIAN, There he lies upon the
   bed--his pulse grows fainter. The many pains of death afflict him. His
   eyes are beginning to glaze, but a brighter light than that of earth
   has dawned upon him! And while the outward man decays, the inward man
   begins to renew his youth. I think I see him when his pains are worst.
   He desires to go, but he is willing to remain as long as his Master
   wills. He says sometimes, "I ill can brook delay," but the next moment
   he checks himself and he says, "Not my will, but Yours be done."

   He sits patiently upon the river's bank, expecting that his Master
   shall open the passage for him to pass over dry shod. He is praying,
   "Speak, Lord and the sooner You will speak the more shall I rejoice.
   Say unto me, 'Come up here.' Speak, Lord; for Your servant
   hears"--hears now better and more distinctly than he ever did hear
   before! He is now nearer to You. The ear is almost closed to the din
   and bustle of the world, while in secret silence of the mind it waits
   the still small voice of Your lips. Speak, Lord and say, "Plunge into
   the river," and I will cheerfully do so if You will but come and meet
   me. "Speak, Lord; for Your servant hears."

   I think I hear that Divine and mysterious voice, which, in fact, none
   can hear but those whose day of Glory is dawning. The messenger has
   come and whispered in the ear of the dying saint and I pray you, mark
   his joy for you may see it! Its light illuminates the countenance. The
   eye sparkles with supernatural Glory. "Now," says the man of God, "my
   journey is over and I am almost Home." "Now," says the expiring Sister,
   "it is victory, glory, triumph! The white horse is at the door--my
   Master bids me mount and ride in triumph, following my Lord Jesus and
   all the conquering ones. The Master is come in His garments of
   salvation and calls for me!"

   The physician says he could see the death-change and the nurse bears
   the same witness, but the well-instructed Believer calls it the
   life-change and reads the true meaning of the mysterious
   transformation. He sees a something which is a prediction of the coming
   Glory! He marks those beaming eyes and that celestial smile. Now
   strange words drop from the lips--sometimes words that are scarcely
   lawful for a man to utter, by reason of the high and awful Glory of
   their meaning. Now come the shouts of victory over death--now the note
   of defiance of the grave! The soul has left all care, all doubt, all
   fear behind! Its foot is not only on the Rock of Ages, but on that part
   of the rock which is on the other side of Jordan. And the soul cries
   with transport, "I am with Him! Another moment I shall be in His arms!
   I see Him! The angelic chariots wait for me--I step into them and I
   ride to the kingdom! Victory, victory, victory, through the blood of
   the Lamb!"

   Something like this was the departing scene of our beloved Sister who
   has gone Home this week and something like this, I trust, will be your
   departure and mine. But it will not, it cannot be thus with us unless
   we are resting upon Christ--

   "None but Jesus--none but Jesus Can do helpless sinners good."

   Lo! These fifteen years have I been preaching Jesus' name and preaching
   nothing but His name and it has a savor about it sweeter than ever! And
   if I had but one word more to speak, I think this should be it--none
   but Jesus, none but Jesus!

   Oh, fly to Him if you would have a blessed death and a glorious
   resurrection! Look out of yourselves away from your frames and your
   feelings! Look away from ceremonies, from priests and from all men!
   Look only to the bleeding wounds of my Master! Trust Jesus expiring on
   the Cross and trust in Him alone! You shall find eternal happiness in
   Him! The Lord bless you with His richest blessing, for Jesus' sake.
   Amen.

                              God'S Strange Choice

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, AUGUST 28, 1864,

   BY THE REV. C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "For you see your calling, Brethren, how that not many wise men after
   the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called. But God has
   chosen the foolish things of the world to confuse the wise, and God has
   chosen the weak things of the world to confuse the things which are
   mighty. And base things of the world and things which are despised has
   God chosen, yes, and things which are not, to bring to nothing things
   that are: that no flesh should glory in His Presence." 1 Corinthians
   1:26-29.

   THE Apostle Paul had been led to make the confession that Christ Jesus
   was despised both by Jew and Gentile. He confessed that this was no
   cause of stumbling to him, for what others counted foolishness he
   believed to be wisdom and rejoiced that the foolishness of God was
   wiser than men, and the weakness of God stronger than men! Lest,
   however, any of the Corinthian Church should be confused by the fact
   that Christ was despised, the Apostle goes on to show that it was the
   general way of God's proceeding to select means which men despised in
   order that by accomplishing His purpose through them, He might have all
   the Glory.

   And he reminds them, for the proof of this, to the one instance of
   their own election and calling--"You see your calling, Brethren," says
   he, "how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not
   many noble, are called." But you, the poor, illiterate, the despised,
   you have been called--still for the same reason--that God may be All in
   All and that no flesh may glory in His Presence. It is clear to
   everyone who will observe either Scripture or fact that God never did
   intend to make His Gospel fashionable! The very last thing that was
   ever in His thoughts was to select the elite of mankind and gather
   dignity for His Truth from the gaudy trappings of rank and station.

   On the contrary, God has thrown down the gauntlet against all the pride
   of manhood. He has dashed mire into the face of all human excellency.
   And with the battle-ax of His strength He has dashed the escutcheon of
   man's glory in two. "Overturn! Overturn! I overturn!" seems to be the
   very motto of the Lord of Hosts and shall be so "until He shall come
   whose right it is to reign and He will give it Him," for His is the
   kingdom and the power and the glory, forever and ever. There is no
   doctrine more truly humbling than the doctrine of election. And it was
   for this reason that the Apostle Paul refers to it--that the disciples
   at Corinth might be quite content to follow the humble and despised
   Cross-bearing Savior because the election of Grace consists of the
   humble and despised, who, therefore, cannot be ashamed to follow One,
   who, like themselves, was despised and rejected of men.

   Coming then, at once to our text, we observe in it very clearly, first,
   the Elector. Secondly, a strange election. Then the elected. And when
   we have considered all these a little, we shall pause over the reasons
   which God has given for His election--that "no flesh should glory in
   His Presence."

   I. First, then, let us this morning soar aloft upon the wings of
   thought to consider for awhile, the ELECTOR. Some men are saved and
   some men are not saved. It remains as a fact never to be questioned
   that some enter into eternal life and some pursue the evil way and
   perish. How is this difference caused? How is it that some mount to
   Heaven? The reason why any sink to Hell is their sin and only their
   sin. They will not repent, they will not believe in Christ, they will
   not turn to God--and therefore they perish willfully by their own act
   and deed.

   But how is it that others are saved? Whose will is it that has made
   them to differ? The text three times most peremptorily answers the
   question. It says not "man has chosen," but it says three times, "God
   has chosen, God has chosen, God has chosen." The Grace which is found
   in any man, and the glory and eternal life to which any attain are all
   the gifts of God's election and are not bestowed according to the will
   of man. This will be clear to any thoughtful person if we first of all
   turn to facts. Wherever we find a case of election in the Old
   Testament, it is manifestly God who makes it. Go back, if you will, to
   the very earliest time. Angels fell--a multitude of bright spirits who
   surrounded the Throne of God and sang His praises were deceived by
   Satan and fell into sin.

   The great serpent drew with him the third part of the stars of
   Heaven--they fell from their obedience--they were condemned to chains
   and to eternal fire forever. Man also sinned. Adam and Eve broke the
   covenant with God and ate of the forbidden fruit--were they condemned
   to eternal fire? No, but God, in the plenitude of His Grace, whispered
   this promise in the woman's ear--"The seed of the woman shall bruise
   the serpent's head." Some men are saved, but no devils are saved. Why?
   Did man make the difference?

   Silence, you vain boaster who dreams of such a thing! It is God Himself
   who testifies, "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will
   have compassion on whom I will have compassion." It was from such
   sovereignty as this that the Lord virtually declared, "I purpose and
   decree that of the race of man I will save a multitude that no man can
   number. They shall be the vessels of My mercy, while yonder angels,
   once My servants but now traitors to their liege Lord, shall, without
   hope forever, experience the terror of My righteousness, the majesty of
   My justice." Here no one ever raises a question. I have never heard the
   most ultra-Pelagian enter a plea for the devil!

   I have heard of Origen who did seem to plead that Satan should be
   included in the general law of mercy, but very few persons nowadays
   talk so. Here is an instance of election--some of the human race saved
   and the angelic race left forever to perish. Who could have made this
   distinction but Jehovah Himself? And we must say there of our favored
   race, "God has chosen." We are not at a loss to see the same
   discriminating Sovereignty at work among the individuals of our own
   race. All men were in the Patriarchal age sunk in heathenism with but a
   few exceptions. There were a few Patriarchs who still, chosen of God,
   held fast to the pure worship of the Most High.

   The Lord determined to adopt a special people who should read the
   Oracles of God--preserve and maintain His Truth. He selected Abram as
   the progenitor of the chosen race. Did Abram choose God, or did God
   call and choose Abram? Was there anything naturally in Abram to entitle
   him to be the servant of the Most High? We have very plain proof in
   Scripture that there was not. He was, on the contrary, described as a
   Syrian ready to perish and his race was like the rest, tainted, to say
   the least, with idolatry. Nevertheless he was called out of the east
   and made the father of the faithful by God's own special will.

   What was there, let me ask you, in the Jews? Why should they be blessed
   with Prophets and the sacrifices and the rites and ordinances of true
   worship, while all the nations were left to bow down before gods of
   wood and stone? We can only say God has done it--His will lights upon
   the race of Israel and leaves the rest in sin. Take any particular case
   of Divine Grace mentioned in the Old Testament, as, for instance, that
   of David. Do we find that David chose the throne and set himself apart
   to be the chosen messenger of God to Israel? Was there some manifest
   fitness in the youngest son of Jesse? No, on the contrary, men had
   chosen his Brethren! Even Samuel said, "Surely the Lord's Anointed is
   before me," as he saw Abinadab go forth.

   But God sees not as man sees and He had chosen the ruddy David that he
   might be king in Jesurun. So might we multiply cases but your own
   thoughts will spare my words. All the facts of the Old Testament go to
   show that God does as He wills in the armies of Heaven and among the
   inhabitants of this lower world. He pulls down and He raises up! He
   lifts the beggar from the dunghill that He may set him among the
   princes of His people. God has chosen, God has chosen and not man! "It
   is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shows
   mercy."

   Let us look at the matter in another light. Clearly the Lord's will
   must determine the matter if we consider His office and position
   towards men. God's office. God is a King. Shall not the king have his
   own will? Men may set up a constitutional monarchy and they are right
   in so doing. But if you could find a being who was perfection itself,
   an absolute form of government would be undeniably the best. At any
   rate, God's government is absolute and though He never violates
   righteousness, for He is Holiness and Truth itself, yet He regards this
   jewel of His crown as being the dearest that He has. "I Am and there is
   none beside Me."

   He gives no account of His matters. Unto all questions He gives this
   answer, "No but, O man, who are you that replies against God? Shall the
   thing formed say to him that formed it, Why have you made me thus? Has
   not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel
   unto honor and another unto dishonor?" The absolute position of God as
   King demands that, especially in the work of salvation, His will should
   be the great determining force.

   Let us state the case and you will see this. A number of criminals are
   shut up in prison, all deserving to die. Their guilt is the same. If
   they are all taken out to execution tomorrow morning, no one can say a
   word against justice. Now if some of these persons are spared, to whose
   discretion should the sparing be left? To their own? True, it will be
   most gracious to send a messenger and bid them all come forth and
   receive sparing mercy if they will come. But suppose they all, with one
   consent, refuse to be saved? Suppose that having been invited to be
   saved, every one of them refuses to accept pardon? If in such a case
   superior mercy determines to override their wicked wills and sets
   itself to secure that some of them shall effectually be saved, with
   whom shall the choice be left?

   If it were left with them they would all of them still choose death
   rather than life. Therefore it were useless to leave it with them.
   Besides, to leave the attribute of mercy in the hand of the criminal
   would be an exceedingly strange mode of procedure. No, let it be the
   king! Let it be the king who shall say who it is that shall be spared
   in mercy and who shall die according to the rule of justice. The
   position of God as King and the position of men as criminals demands
   that salvation shall depend upon the will of God. And truly we may
   better leave it with His will than with our own, for He is kinder to us
   than we are to ourselves! He is more full of love to man than man is of
   love to himself. He is Justice, he is Love! Justice in full-orbed
   splendor--love in unbounded might. Mercy and Truth have met together in
   Him and kissed each other! And it is well, it is well! It is best of
   all that the rule and management of salvation should be left with Him.

   We will now introduce to you a few figures made use of in Scripture in
   connection with the work of salvation and I think you will then see
   that the will must be left with God. Salvation consists in part of an
   adoption. God adopts sinners who were heirs of wrath, even as others,
   into His family. Who is to have authority in the matter of gracious
   adoption? The children of wrath? Surely not. And yet all men are such!
   No. It stands to nature, to reason, to common sense that none but the
   parent can have the discretion to adopt.

   As a father I have a right, if any desire to enter my family, to adopt
   or to refuse to adopt the persons in question. Certainly no person can
   have a right to force himself upon me and say that I shall be
   considered as his reputed parent. The right must, I say, according to
   reason and common sense, lie with the parent. And in adoption it must
   be God who chooses His own children. The Church, again, is called a
   building. With whom does the architecture of the building rest? With
   the building? With the stones? Do the stones select themselves? Did
   that stone over yonder in the corner choose its place? Or that which is
   buried there in the foundation, did it select its proper position? No.
   The architect alone disposes of his chosen materials according to his
   own will. And thus, in building the Church which is the great House of
   God, the great Master Builder reserves to Himself the choice of the
   stones and the places which they shall occupy.

   Take a yet more apparent case. The Church is called Christ's Bride.
   Would any man here agree to have any person forced upon him as his
   bride? There is not a man among us who would, for a single moment, so
   demean himself as to give up his rights to choose his own spouse! And
   shall Christ leave to human will who His Bride shall be? No. But my
   Lord Jesus, the Husband of the Church, exercises the Sovereignty which
   His position permits Him and selects His own Bride.

   Again, we are said to be members of Christ's Body. We are told by David
   that in God's Book, "all our members were written, which in continuance
   were fashioned when as yet there was none of them"--thus every man's
   body had its members written in God's Book. Is Christ's Body to be an
   exception to this rule? Is that great Body of Divine manhood, Christ
   Jesus, the mystical Savior--is that to be fashioned according to the
   whims and wishes of free will--while other bodies, vastly inferior,
   have their members written in the Book of God? Let us not dream
   thus--it were to talk idly and not to know the meaning of the metaphors
   of Scripture! It seems clear to me, according to the figures and
   illustrations of Scripture, that the final choice of the men to be
   saved must be left with God.

   Is not this, dear Friends, most agreeable to your own experience? I am
   sure it is to mine. There may be some who hate this doctrine--there may
   be some whose very mouths foam while they hear us talk of the
   Sovereignty of God! But I confess it touches a secret spring in my
   nature which can compel me to weep when nothing else can. There is a
   something in my consciousness which seems to say, "He must have chosen
   me, for I never could have chosen Him." Determined to live in sin was
   I! Prone to wander! Fond of iniquity! Drinking down evil as the ox
   drinks his fill of water! And now saved by Grace! Dare I for a moment
   impute that salvation to my own choice?

   I do choose God most freely, most fully, but it must be because of some
   previous work upon my heart changing that heart--for my unrenewed heart
   never could have chosen Him. Beloved, do you not feel at this very time
   that the natural bent of your thoughts is away from God? If the Grace
   of God were taken from you, what would you be? Are you not just like
   the bow which is bent when the string keeps it so--but cut that string
   and it flies back to its old place? Would it not be so with you? Would
   you not at once return to your former ways if the mighty Grace of God
   were withdrawn from you? Well then, you clearly see that if even now
   you are regenerate, your corrupt nature does not choose God, much less
   could it have chosen Him when there was no new nature to keep it in
   check and to control it. My Master looks into your faces, O you His
   people, and He says, "You have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you."
   And we each feel that He wakes the echo of our hearts, for we reply,
   "Yes, Lord, we have not chosen You in our natural estate, but You have
   chosen us and unto Your free and Sovereign choice be honor forever and
   ever."

   II. May we feel the present influences of the Holy Spirit while we
   dwell upon the ELECTION ITSELF. The Lord is about to choose a people
   who shall give honor to the Cross of Christ. They are to be redeemed by
   precious blood and they are to be in some sense a worthy reward for the
   great sufferings of Jesus. Now observe how strange is the choice He
   makes. I read with astonishment, "He has not chosen many wise men after
   the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble."

   If man had received the power of choosing, these are just the persons
   who would have been selected! "But God has chosen the foolish things of
   the world to confuse the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of
   the world to confuse the things which are mighty. And base things of
   the world and things which are despised." If man had governed the
   selection, these are the very persons who would have been left out! The
   choice is very strange, very strange! I believe even in Heaven it will
   be the subject of eternal wonder, and except for the reasons given in
   our text, we should have been at a loss to know why it was that with
   Divine scorn He passed by the palaces of haughty kings and looked after
   the base-born and the lowly to make them the subjects of His choice.

   Observe that while it is strange, it has this peculiarity about it--it
   is directly contrary to human choice! Man chooses those who would be
   most helpful to him--God chooses those to whom He can be the most
   helpful. We select those who may give us the best return--God
   frequently selects those who most need His aid. If I choose a friend,
   the tendency is to him because of a certain serviceableness that there
   may be in him to myself--this is the selfishness of man. But God
   chooses His friends according to the serviceableness which He Himself
   may render to the chosen one! It is the very opposite way of choosing.

   We select those who are best because they are most deserving. God
   selects those who are worst because they are least deserving so that
   His choice may be more clearly seen to be an act of Grace and not of
   merit. I say it is clearly contrary to man's way of choosing. Man
   selects the most beautiful, the most lovely. God, on the contrary,
   seeing the blackness and filthiness of everything which is called
   lovely, will not select that which is called so, but takes that which
   even men discover to be unlovely. God then makes it lovely with the
   loveliness which He puts upon it. Strange choice! Is this the manner of
   men, O Lord?

   You will observe that the choice is very gracious--oh, how gracious in
   your case and in mine! It is gracious even in its exclusion. It does
   not say, "Not any wise men," it only says, "Not many," so that the
   great ones are not altogether shut out. Grace is proclaimed to the
   prince and in Heaven there are those who on earth wore coronets and
   prayed. How blessed is the condescending Grace of the choice--it takes
   the weak things, the foolish things. One would have thought that when
   God said, "No," to the prince, He must have said it in order that He
   might be excused from giving mercy to anybody--for we are in the habit
   of saying, "Well, we have refused Mr. So-and-So and he is a much more
   important person than you are, therefore I cannot give the favor to
   you. Why, the king asked me such a favor and I would not do it for him!
   Do you think I would do it for you?"

   But God reasons another way. He passes by the king on purpose that He
   may meet with the beggar. He leaves the noble that He may lay hold upon
   the base. He passes over the philosopher that He may receive the fool.
   Oh this is strange! It is unbelievably strange! It is marvelous! Let us
   praise Him for this wondrous Grace! Oh, how encouraging is this for us
   this morning. Some of us cannot boast of any pedigree. We have no great
   learning. We have no wealth. Our names are all unknown to fame. But oh,
   what a mercy! He has been pleased to choose just such foolish things as
   we are! Such despised creatures as ourselves! Such things that are
   not--to bring to nothing the things that are!

   Not to spend all the time this morning in simply pointing out this
   strange choice and wondering at it, let it suffice us to observe that
   every Christian who finds himself chosen will think his own election to
   be the strangest choice that could have been made--

   "What was there in you that could merit esteem,
   Or give the Creator delight?
   'It was even so, Father!'you ever must sing,
   'Because it seemed good in Your sight.'"

   III. We will now turn to THE ELECTED. The chosen ones are described
   negatively and positively. They are described negatively. "Not many
   wise men after the flesh." Observe, it does not say, "Not many wise men
   merely," but, "not many wise men after the flesh," because God has
   chosen truly wise men, since all His people are made truly wise, but it
   is the "wise after the flesh" that God has not chosen. The "sophoi," as
   the Greek calls them. The philosophers, the men who pretend to have
   wisdom or to love wisdom. The cunning, the metaphysical, the great
   students, the keen observers, the rabbis, the doctors, the
   infallibles--the men who look down with profound scorn upon the
   illiterate and call them idiots--and treat them as if they were the
   dust beneath their feet. These are not chosen in any great number.

   Strange, is it not? And yet a good reason is given. If they were
   chosen, why then they would say, "Ah, how much the Gospel owes to us!
   How our wisdom helps it!" If the first twelve Apostles had all been
   twelve doctors or sages, everybody would have said, "Why, of course the
   Gospel was mighty! There were the twelve picked wise men of Judea, or
   of Greece, to support it." But instead of that, God looks round the
   creeks and bays after twelve poor fishermen who are as ignorant as any
   He can find! He takes them and they become the Apostles. They spread
   the Gospel and the Gospel has the glory and not the Apostles. The wise
   are passed by in the wisdom of God.

   Observe next, He says, "Not many mighty." The wise might have forced
   their way to Heaven by their wit, one would think, but there they are
   with their blind learning, fumbling for the latch of Heaven's
   door--while the illiterate and simple-minded have already entered in!
   Blind wisdom gropes in the dark and like the wise men, it goes to
   Jerusalem in vain, while poor, humble shepherds go to Bethlehem and
   find Christ at once! Here comes another order of great men! The mighty
   men, the valiant champions, the princes, his Imperial Highness, the
   conquerors, the Alexanders, the Napoleons-- are not these chosen?
   Surely when the king becomes a Christian, he can, with his sword,
   compel others to receive Christ--why not choose him?

   "No," says the text, "not many mighty." And you see why--because if the
   mighty had been chosen, we should all say, "Oh, yes, we see why
   Christianity spreads so--it is the good temper of the sword and the
   strength of the arm that wields it." We can all understand the progress
   of Mohammedanism during its first three centuries. Men like Ali and
   Khaled were ready to strike whole nations! They leaped upon their
   steeds, waved their scimitars over their heads and dashed against
   hundreds, fearless of the fight! And it was only when they met such men
   as our Richard Coeur de Lion that Mohammedanism was put back for
   awhile. When the sword met sword, then they that took it perished with
   it!

   Christ chose no warriors--one of his disciples used a sword but it was
   to very poor effect--for he only cut off a man's ear and Christ touched
   that and healed it! And that was the end of poor Peter's fighting. So
   the glory of the Lord's conquests does not depend upon the mighty! God
   has not chosen them. Then he says, "Not many noble," by which he means
   those with a long pedigree, descended through a line of princes, from
   the loins of kings, with blue blood in their veins. "Not many noble,"
   for nobility might have been thought to stamp the Gospel with its
   prestige. "Oh, yes, there is no wonder that the Gospel spreads when My
   Lord This and the Duke of That bends to it."

   Yes, but you see there were few such in the early Church. The saints in
   the catacombs were poor, humble men and women. And it is a very
   memorable fact that out of all the inscriptions in the catacombs of
   Rome written by the early Christians, there is scarcely one which is
   properly spelled. But nearly all of them are as bad in grammar as they
   are in spelling--a clear proof that they were scratched there by poor,
   illiterate, ignorant men who were then the defenders of the faith and
   the true conservators of the Grace of God. We have thus the negative
   side--not the wise, not the mighty, not the noble.

   But now the positive side and I want your careful attention to the
   expression used by the Apostle. "God has chosen the foolish men"?--no,
   it does not say so! "The foolish things," as if the Lord's chosen were
   not by nature good enough to be called men, but were only "things." As
   if the world looked down on them with such scorn that they did not say,
   "Who are these men?" but, "Who are these things?" Once or twice in Luke
   you will observe Christ called a "fellow," but the word "fellow" is put
   in italics, not being in the original--for the Greek runs, "as for
   this, we know not where He is." They did not say what He was, did not
   even call Him a "fellow," though the translation is very good, as
   giving a correct idea to the ordinary reader.

   They seem to say of Christ, "as for this--well, call Him a beast if you
   like--a thing if you like." And so Paul has put it here--"the foolish
   things"--not simply foolish men whom the world should consider to be
   unlearned, ignorant, stupid dolts led by the nose and easily deceived
   into believing this or that, but--"foolish things," which are nothing
   but stupidity has God chosen.

   Next, God has chosen, "The weak things." Do observe the word "things"
   with care. They were not merely weak men, but the world thought them
   weak things. "Ah," said Caesar in the hall, if he said anything at all
   about it--"Who is King Jesus? A poor wretch who was hanged upon a tree!
   Who are these men that are setting Him up? Twelve poor fishermen who
   could hardly muster one single talent of gold between them! Who is this
   Paul who raves so lustily about Christ? A tentmaker! Who are his
   followers? A few despised women who meet him at the waterside! Is Paul
   a philosopher? No, he was publicly laughed at upon Mars' Hill--they
   counted what he said to be mere babbling." No doubt Caesar thought they
   were altogether too inconsiderable to be worthy of his notice. But the
   "weak things" God has chosen.

   Observe the next description, "The base things." The word there
   signifies things without pedigree, things without a father, things
   which cannot trace their descent--no Sir Harry, no Right Honorable is
   akin to them. Their father was a nobody and their mother was a nothing.
   Such were the Apostles of old--they were the base things of this world
   and yet God chose them! As if this were not enough, it is written,
   "Things that are despised," sneered at, persecuted, hunted about, or
   treated with what is worse--with indifference--which is worse than
   scorn. They are not worth notice-- inconsiderable fools--pass them by
   and let them alone." And yet these had God chosen!

   Once more, as if to outdo all and sum it up in one word, "Things that
   are not" has God chosen. Nothings, nonentities. "Oh," says the man of
   the world, "yes, I did just hear that there were a parcel of fanatics
   of that kind." "Oh," says another, "I never even heard of them! I never
   mix myself up in any way with such a low-bred, vulgar set. Did they
   ever have a bishop among them? A Right Reverend Father in God?" "No,
   nothing of the kind, Sir, they are foolish, base, mean, despised. The
   world, therefore, rejects them." "Yet," says God, "/choose them." They
   are the very people that He chooses.

   Now observe that what was true in Paul's day is true now. The Bible
   does not change as years revolve. And in 1864 God chooses the things
   which are despised just as much as in the year 64. And He will yet let
   the world know that those who are ridiculed, styled fanatics, thought
   to be mad and wicked, are yet, after all, His chosen ones destined for
   God and for His Truth to rally the sacramental host of the elect and
   win for God the battle of the last day! In this we are not ashamed to
   glory, that God chooses the things which are despised. And we can take
   our place with the despised people of God, hopeful to partake in the
   election of His Sovereign Grace.

   IV. To conclude, you have THE REASONS WHY GOD HAS CHOSEN THESE PEOPLE.
   There are two reasons given--the first is the immediate reason. The
   second is the ultimate reason. The first, or immediate reason, is
   contained in these words, "God has chosen the foolish things of the
   world to confuse the wise. And God has chosen the weak things of the
   world to confuse the things which are mighty. And base things of the
   world and things which are despised has God chosen, yes, and things
   which are not, to bring to nothing things that are."

   Observe, then, the immediate reason is, first, to confuse the wise. For
   one wise man to confuse another wise man is remarkable. For a wise man
   to confuse a foolish man is very easy. But for a foolish man to confuse
   a wise man--ah, this is the finger of God! You know how it was with the
   first Apostles. A philosopher listened to Paul and when he had heard
   him, he said, "There is nothing in it! Perfect foolishness! Pack of
   stuff from beginning to end! No need for us to take the trouble to
   answer it." Years rolled on and when the philosopher was getting very
   gray, that pestilent heresy of Christianity was spreading
   everywhere--his own daughter was converted--even his wife used to steal
   out at night to the secret assembly!

   The philosopher could not understand it. "There," he said, "I proved
   without a doubt that it was all stupidity and yet these people stick to
   it! I answered all their arguments, did I not? I not only answered and
   confuted, but I clinched my arguments in such a way that I thought I
   had put an end to the folly altogether. But here I see it, in my own
   household!" Sometimes the philosopher had to stand with tears in his
   eyes and say, "I feel it in my own heart, it has beaten me. It has
   confused me--I could reason and rationalize and beat poor Paul--but
   Paul has beaten me! What I thought was folly has confused my wisdom."

   Within a few centuries after the death of Christ the Christian religion
   had spread over the civilized world, while Paganism which had all the
   philosophy of the east and of the west to back it up, had fallen into
   disrepute and was laughed to scorn. Again, God has chosen the weak
   things to confuse the mighty. "Oh," said Caesar, "we will soon root up
   this Christianity--off with their heads." The different governors
   hastened one after another of the disciples to death, but the more they
   persecuted them the more they multiplied. The proconsuls had orders to
   destroy Christians. The more they hunted them, the more Christians
   there were, until at last men pressed to the judgment seat and asked to
   be permitted to die for Christ!

   The State invented torments. They dragged the saints at the heels of
   wild horses. They laid them upon red-hot gridirons. They pulled off the
   skin from their flesh piece by piece. Thy were sawn in two. They were
   wrapped in skins and daubed with pitch--and set in Nero's gardens at
   night to burn. They were left to rot in dungeons. They were made a
   spectacle to all men in the amphitheatre. The bears hugged them to
   death. The lions tore them to pieces--wild bulls tossed them upon their
   horns--and yet Christianity spread! All the swords of the legionaries
   which had put to rout the armies of all nations and had overcome the
   invincible Gaul and the savage Briton could not withstand the
   feebleness of Christianity--for the weakness of God is mightier than
   men.

   If God had chosen the mighty men they would have turned round and said,
   "God is beholden to us." If He had chosen the wise they would have
   said, "Our wisdom has done it." But when He chooses the foolish and
   weak, where are you now, philosopher? Has not God laughed you to scorn?
   Where are you now, O sword and spear? O mighty man who wields them,
   where are you? God's weakness has routed you! It is said that He chose
   the things that are not to bring to nothing the things that are. This
   is even more than confusing them to bring them to nothing--"the things
   that are."

   What were they in the Apostle's days? Jupiter seated upon his lofty
   throne holds the thunderbolt in his hand. Saturn reclined as the father
   of the gods. Venus delighted her votaries with her lustful pleasures.
   The chaste Diana sounded her horn. Here comes Paul with, "there is no
   God but God and Jesus Christ whom He has sent." He represents "the
   things that are not." So contemptible is the heresy of Christianity
   that if a list were made out of the religions of different countries,
   Christianity would have been left out of the catalog!

   But see the result! Where is Jupiter now? Where Saturn? Where Venus and
   Diana? Except as classical names in the dictionaries of the learned,
   where are they? Who bows before the shrine of Ceres in the day of
   harvest, or who lifts up his prayers to Neptune in the hour of storm?
   Ah, they have gone. "The things that are" have been brought to nothing
   by the "things that are not." Let us reflect that what is true in
   Paul's day is true today. This year 1864 shall see repeated the
   miracles of the olden times--the things that are shall be brought to
   nothing by the things that are not.

   See in Wickliffe's time. The things that are were the holy crucifixes
   in every Church. St. Winifred, St. Thomas of Canterbury are worshipped
   by all the multitudes of Englishmen. There comes My Lord Archbishop
   through the street! Yonder is the pope worshipped by thousands and
   there is the Virgin adored of all! What do I see? A solitary monk at
   Lutterworth begins to preach against the begging friars. And in
   preaching against them he finds out the Truth of God and begins to
   preach that Christ is the only ground of salvation and that they who
   trust in Him are saved!

   Well, it was such a contemptible thing that at first they did not care
   to persecute him. It is true at last he was brought up before His Grace
   at St. Paul's, but there was a strong man, one John O'Gaunt, who came
   up with him and said a word or two in his rough way and Wickliffe was
   allowed to sit down. And though condemned, he returns to his parish of
   Lutterworth. "The thing that was not!" It was not worthy to be put down
   by blood, it would die out of itself. Did it die out? Where are your
   holy crucifixes today? Where is St. Thomas of Canterbury, where are St.
   Agnes and St. Winifred?

   Ask our Puseyite friends, for they, alone, can tell you. True consorts
   of the moles and of the bats--they know where the idols have been
   cast--they seek to restore the superstitions of the past. But by God's
   Grace their task shall be no easy one. The present system of English
   superstition, with its water regeneration, its baptismal grace, its
   confirmations and its giving of grace through bread and wine--though it
   is attacked by those who are things that are not--shall yet cease to
   be! And the Truth as it is in Jesus--the pure simple faith that no man
   is a priest distinctively above his fellows--that every Christian is a
   priest unto God. The pure Truth, I say, that no water can necessarily
   bring the Spirit of God with it, and that no outward forms and rites
   have any virtue in them--apart from the faith of those who receive
   them--these, backed by the Spirit of God, shall bring to nothing the
   things that are.

   Here we fall back upon the strength of God. I would not have God's
   champions stronger. Brethren, were they stronger they would take glory
   to themselves. Let them be weak and let them be few and let them be
   despised. Their fewness, their poverty, their weakness shall make the
   shout of praise unto the eternal Conqueror yet more loud and the music
   shall be undivided! There shall only be this refrain, "Not unto us, not
   unto us, but unto Your name give glory for Your Truth's sake." This,
   then, is God's immediate object in choosing foolish things, weak
   things, things that are not--to confuse the mighty.

   But His ultimate reason is "that no flesh may glory in His Presence." I
   want you to notice that last sentence and I have done. He does not say,
   "that no man." No, the text is in no humor to please anybody. It says,
   "that no flesh." What a word! What a word, I say! Here are Solon and
   Socrates, the wise men. God points at them with His finger and calls
   them, "flesh." Flesh is sold in the shambles, is it not? Dogs tear it.
   Worms eat it--nothing but flesh. There is Caesar with his imperial
   purple cast about him and as he stands erect, the mighty Imperator, how
   the Praetorian guards unsheathe their swords and shout, "Great is the
   Emperor! Long may he live!" "Flesh," says God's Word, "flesh."

   Here they come tramping on, hundreds in a line, the strong legionaries
   of Rome! Who can stand against their swords and shields? "Flesh," says
   the Word, "flesh." Here are men whose sires were of royal lineage and
   grandsires of imperial rank and they can trace back the long line of
   honor. "Flesh," says God, "flesh, nothing but flesh." Dogs' meat.
   Worms' meat when God wills it. "That no flesh may glory in His
   Presence." Do you see, then? God puts this stamp upon us all-- that we
   are nothing but flesh--and He chooses the poorest flesh and the most
   foolish flesh and the weakest flesh--that all the other flesh that is
   only flesh and only grass may see that God pours contempt on it and
   will have no flesh glory in His Presence!

   Now what is your spirit this morning towards this subject? Do you kick
   at it? Do you say you cannot bear it? I am afraid you want to glory in
   God's Presence. Your views of things and God's views of things differ,
   and therefore you need to have a new heart and a right spirit. But, on
   the contrary, do you say this morning, "I have nothing to boast of. I
   would not glory in Your Presence, but I would lie in the very dust and
   say, 'Do with me as You will' "? Sinner, do you feel that you are
   nothing but flesh and sinful flesh? Are you so broken before God that
   you feel let Him do as He will with you? Do you know that He will be
   just and you can only appeal to His Sovereign Mercy?

   Then God and you are one, you are reconciled! I can see that you are
   reconciled. When God and you are agreed that God should reign, then God
   is agreed that you should live! Sinner, touch the scepter of His Grace!
   Jesus Crucified stands before you now and bids you look to Him and
   live! That you are bid to look is an instance of mighty Grace--and that
   you are enabled to look this morning will be a wonder of Divine love
   for which you will have to bless Him in time and eternity! And now may
   that God whose name we have sought to honor this morning bless these
   stammering of ours, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

                            The Prodigal'S Reception

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 4, 1864, BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT
   THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And he arose and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way
   off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and fell on his
   neck and kissed him."

   Luke 15:20.

   THERE he is! He is as wretched as misery itself--as filthy as his brute
   associates who could satisfy themselves with husks--while he could not.
   His clothes hang about him in rags and what he is on the outside, that
   he is within. He is disgraced in the eyes of the good and the virtuous
   remember him with indignation. He has some desires to go back to his
   father's house but these desires are not sufficient to alter his
   condition. Mere desires have not scraped the filth from him, nor have
   they so much as patched his rags. Whatever he may or may not desire, he
   is still filthy, still disgraced, still an alien from his father's
   house--and he knows it--for, by God's Grace, he has come to himself.

   He would have been angry if we had said as much as this before, but now
   we cannot describe him in words too black. With many tears and sighs he
   assures us that he is even worse than he appears to be and that no man
   can know all the depth of the vileness of his conduct--he has spent his
   living with harlots--he has despised a generous parent's love and
   broken loose from his wise control. He has done evil with both his
   hands to the utmost of his strength and opportunity. There he stands,
   notwithstanding this confession, just what I have described him to
   be--for even though he has said within himself, "I have sinned"--yet
   that confession has not removed his griefs.

   He acknowledges that he is not worthy to be called a son--and it is
   true he is not. But his unworthiness is not removed by his
   consciousness of it nor by his confession of it. He has no claims to a
   father's love. If that father shuts the door in his face, he acts with
   justice. If he shall refuse so much as to speak a single word, except
   words of rebuke, no one can blame the father, for the son has so sadly
   erred. To this the son utters no denial. He confesses that if he is
   cast away forever, he well deserves it.

   This picture, I know, is the photograph of some who are now present.
   You feel your vileness and sinfulness but you cannot look upon that
   sense of vileness as in any way extenuating or altering your condition.
   You feel, but you cannot plead, your feelings. You confess this morning
   that you have desires towards God but that you have no rights to Him--
   you cannot demand anything at His hands. If your soul were sent to
   Hell, His righteous Law approves it and so does your own conscience!
   You can see your rags. You can mark your filthiness. You can long for
   something better but you are no better. You have no more claims than
   you used to have upon God's mercy. You stand here today a
   self-convicted offender against the loving kindness and holiness of
   God.

   I pray that to such of you as are in this shape I may be the bearer of
   a message from God to your soul this morning. O you who know the Lord,
   put up earnest and silent prayers just now that my message may come
   home with power to troubled consciences! And I beseech you, for your
   own profit, look back to the hole of the pit where you were dug and to
   the miry clay where you were drawn and remember how God received you!
   And while we talk of what He is willing and able to do to the far-off
   sinners, let your souls leap with joyous gratitude at the recollection
   of how He received you into His love and made you partakers of His
   Grace in days gone by.

   There are two things in the text--the first is the condition of many a
   seeker--he is yet a great way off. And then, secondly, the matchless
   kindness of the Father towards him.

   I. First, dear Friends, THE CONDITION OF SUCH A SEEKER--HE IS YET A
   GREAT WAY OFF. He is a great way off if you consider one or two things.
   Remember his need of strength. This poor young man had, for some time,
   been without food--brought so very low that the husks upon which the
   swine fed would have seemed a dainty to him if he could have eaten
   them. He is so hungry that he has become emaciated and to him every
   mile has the weariness of leagues within it.

   It costs him many pains and sore griefs to drag himself along, even
   though it is but an inch. So the sinner is a long way off from God when
   you consider his utter need of strength to come to God. Even such
   strength as God has given him is very painfully used. God has given him
   strength enough to desire salvation but those desires are always
   accompanied with deep and sincere grief for sin. The point which he has
   already reached has exhausted all his power and all he can do is fall
   down before Jesus and say--

   "Oh, for this no strength have I,
   My strength is at Your feet to lie."

   He is a great way off, again, if you consider his need of courage. He
   longs to see his father but yet the probabilities are that if his
   father should come he would run away--the very sound of his father's
   footsteps would act upon him as they did on Adam in the garden--he
   would hide himself among the trees. So instead of crying after his
   father, the great father would have to cry after him--"Where are you,
   poor fallen creature? Where are you?" His need of courage, therefore,
   makes the distance long--for every step up to now has been taken as
   though into the jaws of death. "Ah," says the sinner, "it must be a
   long time before I can dare to hope--for my inequities have gone over
   my head so that I cannot look up."

   Are you, then, in alarm and dread this morning? Do your prayers seem to
   have been no prayers at all? When you think of God, does terror come
   over your mind and you feel that you are a long, long way from Him? Do
   you imagine that it is not likely that He will hear your cries nor give
   heed to your words? You are yet a great way off. You are a great way
   off when we consider the difficulty of the way of repentance. John
   Bunyan tells us that Christian found, when he went back to the arbor
   after his lost roll, that it was very hard work going back. Every
   backslider finds it so and every penitent sinner knows that there is a
   bitterness in mourning for sin comparable to the loss of one's only
   son.

   A drowning man feels no great pain--the sensations of drowning are even
   said to be pleasant. It is only when the man is being restored to
   life--when the blood begins to make the veins tingle because life leaps
   there, when once again the nerves are sensitive--then, we are told, the
   whole body is full of many agonies! But then they are the agonies of
   life! And so the poor penitent feels the goal must be a great way off,
   for if he had to feel as he now feels, even for a month, it were too
   long a time. And if he had to journey many miles as he now journeys, so
   painfully, with such bleeding feet, it would, indeed, be a great way!

   Let us look into this matter and show that while the road seems long on
   this account, it really is long if we view it in a certain light. There
   are many seeking sinners who are a great way off in their life. I think
   I see the man now and hear him thus bewail himself--"I have left off my
   drunkenness. I could not sit where I used to sit by the hour. I thank
   God I shall never be seen reeling through the streets again, for that
   groveling lust I detest. I have given up Sabbath-breaking and I am
   found in God's House. And I have endeavored, as much as I can, to
   renounce the habit of swearing, but still I am a great way off--I do
   not feel as if I could yet lay hold of Christ for I cannot master my
   own passions yet.

   "An old companion stopped me this week and he had not long been talking
   before I found the old man was in me and the old lusting came up into
   my face again. Why, Sir, the other day an oath came rapping out. I
   thought 1 had got over it, but I had not--I am a great way off. When I
   read of what saints are and observe what true Christians are, I do feel
   that my conduct is so inconsistent and so widely apart from what it
   ought to be that I know that I am a great way off."

   "Ah, dear Friend, you are. And if you had to come to God by the way of
   your own righteousness you would never reach Him for He is not thus to
   be found. Christ Jesus is the way! He is the safe, sure, and perfect
   road to God. He who sees Jesus has seen the Father. But he who looks to
   himself will only see despair. The road to Heaven by Mount Sinai is
   impassable by mortal man, but Calvary leads to Glory! The secret places
   of the stairs are in the wounds of Jesus.

   Again, you feel yourself a great way off as to knowledge. "Why," you
   say, "before I felt thus I considered myself a master of all theology.
   I could twist the doctrines round my fingers. When I listened to a
   sermon I felt quite able to criticize it and to give my judgment. Now I
   see that my judgment was about as valuable as the criticism of a blind
   man upon a picture, for I was without spiritual'sight. Now I feel
   myself to be a fool! I do know what sin means, but only to a degree.
   Even here I feel that I am not conscious of the heinousness of human
   guilt. I have heard the doctrine of the Atonement of Christ and I thank
   God I know it to some degree, but the excellence and glory of the
   Substitutionary Sacrifice which Christ offered--I confess I do not
   fully comprehend."

   The sinner's confession now is that instead of understanding Scripture
   he finds he needs to go, like a child, to school to learn the A B C of
   it. "O Sir," he says, "I am a great way off from God for I am so
   ignorant, so foolish. I seem to be but as a beast when I think of the
   deep things of God." Ah, poor Soul! Poor young wandering Brother! I
   wonder not that it seems so to you for the ignorance of the carnal man
   is, indeed, fearful, and only God can give you light. But He can give
   it to you in a momentand the distance between you and Him upon the
   score of ignorance can be bridged at once and you may comprehend even
   today, with all saints, what are the heights and depths and know the
   love of Christ which passes knowledge.

   In another point many an earnest seeker is a great way off, I mean in
   his repentance. "Alas," says he, "I cannot repent as I ought. If only I
   could feel the brokenness of heart which I have heard and seen in some!
   Oh, what would I give for penitential sighs! How thankful would I be if
   my head were waters and my eyes fountains of tears. If I could even
   feel that I was as humble as the poor publican and could stand with
   downcast eyes and beat upon my breast and say, 'God be merciful to me a
   sinner.' But, alas, I have been a hearer of the Word for years and all
   the progress I have made is so little that while I know the Gospel is
   true, I do not feel it. I know myself to be a sinner, and sometimes I
   mourn over it, but my mourning is so superficial, my repentance is a
   repentance that needs to be repented'of O Sir, if God would use the
   heaviest hammer that He had--if He would but break my heart--every
   broken fragment should bless His name!"

   "I wish I had a genuine repentance. Oh, how I pant to be brought to
   feel that I am lost and to desire Christ with that vehement desire
   which will not take a denial. But in this point my heart seems hard as
   Hell-hardened steel. Cold as a rock of ice. It will not, cannotyield
   though wooed by Divine love. Adamant itself may run in liquid torrents,
   but my soul yields to nothing. Lord, break it! Lord, break it!"

   Ah, poor Heart. I see you are a great way off, but do you know if my
   Lord should appear to you this morning and say to you, "I have loved
   you with an everlasting love," your heart would break in a moment?--

   "Law and terrors do but harden, All the while they work alone. But a
   sense of blood-bought pardon, Can dissolve a heart of stone."

   Great way off as you are, if the Lord pardons you while yet callous and
   consciously hard of heart, will you not then fall at His feet and
   commend that great love with which He loved you--even when you were
   dead in trespasses and sins?

   Yes, but I think I hear one say, "There is another point in which I
   feel a great way off, for I have little or no faith. I have heard faith
   preached every Sunday. I know what it is--I think I do--but I cannot
   reach it. I know that if I cast myself wholly upon Christ I shall be
   saved. I quite comprehend that He does not ask anything of me, any
   willings, or doings, or feelings--I know that Christ is willing to
   receive the greatest sinner out of Hell if that sinner will but come
   and simply trust Him. I have tried to do it! Sometimes I have thought I
   had faith, but then, again, when I have looked at my sins I have
   doubted so dreadfully that I perceive I have no faith at all! There are
   bright moments with me when I think I can say--

   'My faith is built on nothing less, Than Jesus' blood and
   righteousness,' but oh, when I feel my corruptions within rising upon
   me, I hear a voice saying, 'The Philistines are upon you, Samson,' and
   straightway I discover my own weakness. I have not the faith that I
   want! I am a great way off from it and I fear that I shall never
   possess it."

   Yes, my Brethren, I perceive your difficulty, for I have felt the
   sorrow of it myself. But oh, my Lord, who is the Giver of faith--who is
   exalted on high to give repentance and remission of sins--can give you
   the faith you so much desire and can cause you, this morning, to rest
   with perfect confidence upon the work which He has finished for you! To
   gather up all things in one word, the truly penitent sinner feels that
   he is yet a great way off in everything. There is no point upon which
   you can talk with him but it will be sure to lead to a confession of
   his deficiency. Begin to put him in the scales of the sanctuary and he
   cries, "Alas, before you put in the weights I can tell you I shall be
   found wanting." Bring him to the touchstone and he shrinks from it!
   "No," he says, "but I cannot endure any sort of trial--

   'All unholy and unclean, I am nothing else but sin.'"

   Look, look how well my Master has pictured your case in this
   parable--"Yet a great way off"--yet covered with rags! Yet polluted
   with filth! Yet in disgrace! Yet a stranger to your Father's house!
   There is only this one point about you--you have your face towards your
   Father--you have a desire towards God and you would, oh, you would if
   you could, lay hold upon eternal life! But you feel too far off for
   anything like comfortable hope.

   Now I must confess I feel many fears about you who are in this state. I
   am afraid lest you should come so far and yet go back--for there are
   many whom we thought had come as far as this and yet they have gone
   back, after all. Oh, remember that desires after God will not change
   you so as to save you! You must find Christ! Remember that to say, "I
   will arise," is not enough, nor even to arise--you must never rest till
   your Father has given you the kiss--till He has put the best robe on
   you.

   I am afraid lest you should rest satisfied and say, "I am in a good
   state. The minister tells us that many are brought to such a state
   before they are saved. I will stop here." My dear Friend, it is a good
   state to pass through, but it is a bad state to rest in. I pray you
   never are content with a sense of sin, never be satisfied with merely
   knowing that you are not what you ought to be. It never cures the fever
   for a man to know he has it. His knowledge is in some degree a good
   sign, for it proves that the fever has not yet driven him to delirium.
   But it never gives a man perfect health to know that he is sick. It is
   a good thing for him to know it, for he will not otherwise send for the
   physician--but unless it leads to that he will die whether he feels
   himself to be sick or not.

   A mere consciousness that you are hungry while your father's hired
   servants have bread enough to spare will not lessen your hunger--you
   need more than this. You are a great way off and I beseech you remember
   what the danger is lest you should stop here or should lose what
   sensibility you already have. Perhaps despair may come upon you. Some
   have committed suicide while under a sense of the greatness of their
   distance from God because they dared not look to the Savior. Our
   prayers shall go up to God that the second part of our text may come
   true to you and that backsliding and despair alike may be prevented by
   the speedy coming of God dressed in the robes of Grace to meet your
   guilty soul and give you joy and peace through believing!

   II. Secondly--and O, may the Master give us His help--we have to
   consider THE MATCHLESS KINDNESS OF THE HEAVENLY FATHER. We must take
   each word and dwell upon it. First of all we have here Divine
   observation. "When he was yet a great way off his father saw him." It
   is true He has always seen him. God sees the sinner in every state and
   in every position. Yes, and sees him with an eye of love, too--such a
   chosen sinner as is described in this text--not with complacency, but
   with affection God looks upon His wandering chosen ones.

   I say that Father saw His son when he spent his living with harlots. He
   saw him with deep sorrow when he gladly would have filled his belly
   with the husks which the swine ate. But now, if there can be such a
   thing as for Divine Omniscience to become more exact, the Father sees
   him with an eye full of a more tender love, a greater care. "His father
   saw him." Oh, what a sight it was for a father to see! His son, it is
   true, but his reprobate son, who had dishonored his father's
   name--brought down the name of an honorable house to be mentioned among
   the dregs and scum of the earth!

   There he is! What a sight for a father's eye! He is filthy, as though
   he had been rolling in the mire. And his fine clothing has long ago
   lost its fine colors and hangs about him in wretched rags. The father
   does not turn away and try to forget him--he fixes his full gaze upon
   him. Sinner, you know that God sees you this morning! Sitting in this
   house you are observed by the God of Heaven. There is not a desire in
   your heart unread by Him, nor a tear in your eye which He does not
   observe! I tell you He has seen your midnight sins. He has heard your
   cursing and your blasphemies and yet He has loved you notwithstanding
   all that you have done!

   You could hardly have been a worse rebel against Him and yet He has
   noted you in His book of love and determined to save you! The eye of
   His love has followed you wherever you have gone. Is there not some
   comfort here? Why could not he see his father? Was it the effect of the
   tears in his eyes that he could not see? Or was it that his father was
   of quicker sight than he? Sinner, you can not see God for you are
   unbelieving and carnal and blind, but He can see you! Your tears of
   penitence block up your sight, but your Father is quick of eye and He
   beholds you and loves you now. In every glance there is love.

   "His father saw him." Observe this was a loving observation, for it is
   written, "His father saw him." He did not see him as a mere casual
   observer. He did not note him as a man might note his friend's child
   with some pity and benevolence, but he marked him as a father, alone,
   can do. What a quick eye a parent has! Why, I have known a young man
   come home, perhaps for a short holiday--the mother has heard nothing,
   not even a whisper, as to her son's conduct and yet she cannot help
   observing to her husband, "There is a something about John which makes
   me suspect that he is not going on as he should do. I do not know, my
   Husband," she says, "what it is. But yet I am sure he is getting among
   bad companions." She will read his character at once. And the father
   notes something, too. He cannot precisely say what, but he knows it to
   be cause for anxiety.

   But here we have a Father who can see everything and who has as much of
   the quickness of love as He has of the certainty of knowledge. He can,
   therefore, see every spot and bruise and note every putrefying sore. He
   sees His poor son right through as though he were a vase of crystal--He
   reads his heart--not merely the telltale garments. Not merely the
   sorrowful tale of the unwashed face and those clouted shoes, but He can
   read his soul! He understands the whole of his miserable plight. O poor
   Sinner, there is no need for you to give information to your God for He
   knows it already! You need not pick your words in prayer in order to
   make your case plain and easy to understand! God can see it! All you
   have to do is to uncover your wounds, your bruises and your putrefying
   sores and say, "My Father, You see it all, the black tale you read in a
   moment. My Father, have pity upon me."

   The next thought to be well considered is Divine compassion. "When he
   saw him he had compassion on him." Does not the word "compassion" mean
   suffering with, or, fellow-suffering? What is compassion, then, but
   putting yourself into the place of the sufferer and feeling his grief?
   If I may say so, the father put himself into the son's rags and then
   felt as much pity for him as that poor ragged prodigal could have felt
   for himself. I do not know how to bring up your compassion this morning
   unless it is by supposing that it is your own case.

   I saw, not many hours ago, a young man who brought to my mind the
   prodigal in this case--his face marked with innumerable lines of sin
   and wretchedness. His body lean and emaciated, his clothes
   close-buttoned--his whole appearance the very mirror of woe. He knocked
   at my door. I knew his situation--I cannot hurt him by telling it. He
   had disgraced his family--not once or twice--but many times. At last he
   drew out what money he had in the business of a respectable family,
   came up to London with four hundred pounds and in about five weeks
   spent it all!

   And, without a single farthing to help himself, he often begs for
   bread. And I fear that he has often crept at night into the parks to
   sleep and thus has brought aches and pains into his bones which will be
   with him till he dies. He wanders the streets by day a vagabond and a
   reprobate. I have written to his friends--the case has been put before
   them. They will not have anything to do with him. And considering his
   shameful conduct, I do not wonder. He has no father and no mother left.
   If he were helped beyond mere food and lodging, as far as we can judge,
   it would be money thrown away.

   If he were helped, he seems so desperately set on wickedness that he
   would do the same again. Yet, as I think, I can but desire to see him
   have one more chance, at least, and he would have it, I doubt not, if
   his father yet lived. But others feel the fountains of their love are
   stayed. As I think of him, I cannot but feel that if he were a son of
   mine and I were his father and I saw him in such a case come to my
   door, whatever the crime was that he had committed, I must fall upon
   his neck and kiss him. The biggest sin could not put out forever the
   sparks of paternal love. I might condemn the sin in sharpest terms and
   most severely. I might regret that he had ever been born and cry with
   David, "O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would God I had died
   for you!" but I could not shut him out of my house, nor refuse to call
   him my child. My child he is and my child he shall be till he dies.

   You feel just now that if it were your child you would do the same.
   That is how God feels towards you, His chosen, His repentant child. You
   are His child--I hope so, I trust so--those desires which you have in
   your soul towards Him make me feel that you are one of His children.
   And as God looks out of Heaven He knows what you mean. What is it? What
   shall I say? No, I need not describe, but, "Like as a father pities his
   children, so the Lord pities them that fear Him." He will have
   compassion upon you. He will receive you to His bosom--be of good
   courage, for the text says, "He had compassion on him."

   Notice and observe carefully the swiftness of this Divine love. "He
   ran." Probably he was walking on the top of his house and looking out
   for his son, when one morning he just caught a glimpse of a poor sorry
   figure in the distance. If he had been anything but the father he would
   not have known it to be his son. But he looked and looked again, till
   at last he said, "It is he! Oh, what marks of famine are upon him and
   of suffering, too!" And down comes the old gentleman--I think I see him
   running downstairs and the servants come to the windows and the doors,
   and say, "Where is Master going? I have not seen him run at that rate
   for many a day."

   See, there he goes! He does not take the road for that is a little
   round about. But there is a gap through the hedge and he is jumping
   over it! The straightest way that he can find he chooses. And before
   the son has had time to notice who it is, he is on him and has his arms
   about him, falling upon his neck and kissing him! I remember a young
   prodigal who was received in the same way. Here he stands. It is I,
   myself. I sat in a little Chapel, little dreaming that my Father saw
   me. Certainly I was a great way off.

   I felt something of my need of Christ, but I did not know what I must
   do to be saved. Though taught the letter of the Word, I was spiritually
   ignorant of the plan of salvation. Though taught it from my youth up, I
   knew it not. I felt, but I did not feel what I wished to feel. If ever
   there was a soul that knew itself to be far off from God, I was that
   soul. And yet in a moment, in one single moment--no sooner had I heard
   the words--"Look unto Me and be you saved, all the ends of the
   earth"--no sooner had I turned my eyes to Jesus Crucified than I felt
   my perfect reconciliation with God! I knew my sins were then forgiven!

   There was no time for getting out of my heavenly Father's way--it was
   done and done in an instant! And in my case, at least, He ran and fell
   upon my neck to kiss me. I hope that will be the case this
   morning--before you can get out of this place--before you can get back
   to your old doubts and fears and sighs and cries--I hope here the Lord
   of Love will run and meet you and fall upon your neck and kiss you!

   After noticing thus--observation, compassion and swiftness, do not
   forget the nearness--"He fell upon his neck and kissed him." This I can
   understand by experience, but it is too wonderful for me to explain.
   "He fell upon his neck." He did not stand at a distance and say, "John,
   I would be very glad to kiss you but you are too filthy. I do not know
   what may be under those filthy rags. I do not feel inclined to fall
   upon your neck just yet--you are too far gone for me. I love you, but
   there is a limit to the display of love. When I have got you into a
   proper state, then I may manifest my affection to you but I cannot just
   now, while you are so very foul."

   Oh, no! But beforehe is washed He falls on his neck--thereis the wonder
   of it! I can understand how God manifests His love to a soul that is
   washed in Jesus' blood and knows it. But how He could fall upon the
   neck of a foul, filthy sinner as such! There it is--not as sanctified,
   not as having anything good in himself--but as nothing but a filthy,
   foul, desperate rebel, God falls upon his neck and kisses him! Oh,
   strange miracle of love! The riddle is solved when you remember that
   God never had looked upon that sinner as he was in himself--He had
   always looked upon him as he was in Christ!

   And when He fell upon that prodigal's neck, He did, in effect, only
   fall upon the neck of His once-suffering Son, Jesus Christ, and He
   kissed the sinner because He saw him in Christ! He did not see the
   sinner's loathsomeness, but saw only Christ's loveliness and therefore
   kissed him as He would have kissed his Substitute. Observe how near God
   comes to the sinner! It was said of that eminent saint and martyr,
   Bishop Hooper, that on one occasion a man in deep distress was allowed
   to go into his prison to tell his tale of conscience. But Bishop Hooper
   looked so sternly upon him and addressed him so severely, at first,
   that the poor soul ran away and could not get comfort until he had
   sought out another minister of a gentler aspect.

   Now Hooper really was a gracious and loving soul, but the sternness of
   his manner kept the penitent off. There is no such stern manner in our
   heavenly Father! He loves to receive His prodigals. When He comes there
   is no, "Hold off!" No "Keep off!" to the sinner. No, He falls upon his
   neck and He kisses him! There is yet another thought to be brought out
   of the metaphor of kissing. We are not to pass that over without
   dipping our cup in the honey. In kissing his son the father recognizes
   relationship. He said, with emphasis, "You are myson," and the prodigal
   was--

   " To his Father's bosom pressed, Once for all a child confessed."

   Again, that kiss was the seal of forgiveness. He would not have kissed
   him if he had been angry with him. He forgave him, forgave him all.
   There was, moreover, something more than forgiveness--there was
   acceptance--"I receive you back into my heart as though you were worthy
   of all that I give to your elder brother and therefore I kiss you."
   Surely this was also a kiss of delight--as if he took pleasure in him,
   delighting in him, feasting his eyes with the sight of him and feeling
   more happy to see him than to see all his fields and the fatted calves
   and all the treasures that he possessed! His delight was in seeing this
   poor restored child. Surely this is all summed up in a kiss.

   And if this morning my Father and your Father should come out to meet
   mourning penitents, in a moment He will show you that you are His
   children! You shall say, "Abba, Father," on your road to your own
   house! You shall feel that your sins are all forgiven, that every
   particle has been cast behind Jehovah's back! You shall feel today that
   you are accepted--as your faith looks to Christ you shall see that God
   accepts you--because Christ your Substitute is worthy of God's love and
   God's delight! I trust you shall, this very morning, delight yourself
   in God, because God delights Himself in you and you shall hear Him
   whisper in your ear, "You shall be called Hephzibah . . . for the Lord
   delights in you."

   I wish I could picture such a text as this as it ought to be. It needs
   some tender, sympathetic heart--some man who is the very soul of
   pathos--to work out the tender touches of such a verse as this! But,
   oh, though I cannot describe it, I hope you will feel it and that is
   better than description. I come not here to paint the scene, except to
   be the brush in God's hand to paint it on your hearts. There are some
   of you who can say, "I do not want descriptions, for I have felt it. I
   went to Christ and told Him my case and prayed Him to meet me. Now I
   believe on Him and I have gone my way rejoicing in Him."

   We will just say these words and have done. In summing up, one may
   notice that this sinner, though he was a great way off, was not
   received to full pardon and adoption and acceptance by a
   gradualprocess, but he was received at once! He was not allowed to
   enter into the outhouse first and to sleep in a barn at night. And then
   afterwards allowed to come, sometimes, and have his meals with the
   servants in the kitchen. And then afterwards allowed to sit at the end
   of the table and by degrees brought near. No. The father fell on his
   neck and kissed him the first moment! He gets as near to God, as he
   ever will, the very first moment! So a saved soul may not enjoy and
   know so much, but he is as near and dear to God the first moment he
   believes as he ever will be--a true heir of all things in Christ and as
   truly so as even when he shall mount to Heaven to be glorified and to
   be like his Lord.

   Oh, what a wonder is this! Fresh from his pigsty, was he not? Yet in a
   father's bosom! Fresh from the swine with their grunts in his ears and
   now he hears a father's loving words! A few days ago he was putting
   husks to his mouth and now it is a father' s lips that are on his lips.
   What a change and all at once! I say there is no gradual process in
   this, but the thing is done at once--in a moment he comes to his
   father--his father comes to him and he is in his father' s arms!

   Observe again, as there was not a gradual reception, there was not a
   partialreception. He was not forgiven on conditions. He was not
   received to his father's heart if he would do so-and-so. No. There were
   no "ifs," no "buts." He was kissed and clothed and feasted without a
   single condition of any kind whatever. No questions asked--his father
   had cast his offenses behind his back in a moment and he was received
   without even a censure or a rebuke. It was not a partial reception. He
   was not received to some things and refused others. He was not, for
   instance, allowed to call himself a child, but to think of himself an
   inferior. No! He wears the best robe. He has the ring on his finger. He
   has the shoes on his feet. And he joins in eating the fatted calf.

   And so the sinner is not received to a second-class place, but he is
   taken to the full position of a child of God. It is not a gradual nor
   yet a partial reception. And once more, it is not a temporary
   reception. His father did not kiss him and then turn him out at the
   back door. He did not receive him for a time, and then afterwards say
   to him, "Go your way. I have had pity upon you. You have now a new
   start--go into the far country and mend your ways." No, the father
   would say to him what he had already said to the elder brother, "Son,
   you are ever with me and all that I have is yours."

   In the parable, the son could not have the goods restored for he had
   spent his part. But in truth itself and matter of fact, God makes the
   man who comes in at the eleventh hour equal with the one who came in at
   the first hour of the day--He gives every man the penny. And He gives
   to the child who has been the most wandering the same privileges and
   ultimately the same heritage which He gives to His own who have been
   these many years with Him and have not transgressed His Commandments.

   That is a remarkable passage in one of the Prophets, where he says,
   "Ekron as a Jebusite," meaning that the Philistine, when converted,
   should be treated just the same as the original inhabitants of
   Jerusalem--that the branches of the olive which were grafted in have
   the same privileges as the original branches! When God takes men from
   being heirs of wrath and makes them heirs of Grace they have just as
   much privilege at the first as though they had been heirs of Grace
   twenty years! In God's sight they always were heirs of Grace and from
   all eternity He viewed His most wandering sons--

   "Not as they stood inn Adam's fall, When sin and ruin covered all. But
   as they'll stand another day, Fairer than the sun's meridian ray."

   O, I would to God that He would in His infinite mercy bring some of His
   own dear children home this day and He shall have the praise, world
   without end. Amen.

                           Jesus Meeting His Warriors

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S DAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 11, 1864, BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was
   the priest of the Most High God. And he blessed him and said, Blessed
   be Abram of the Most High God, possessor of Heaven and earth: and
   blessed be the Most High God, which has delivered your enemies into
   your hand. And he ga ve him tithes of all." Genesis 14:18-20.

   What a splendid type is Abram, in the narrative before us, of our Lord
   Jesus Christ! Let us read this story of Abram in connection with our
   Savior and see how full of meaning it is. Our Lord Jesus Christ, in the
   abundance of His love, had taken us to be His brothers. But we, through
   our sin, had gone into the land of Sodom and Jesus Christ dwelt alone
   in His safety and His happiness, enjoying the Presence of God. The
   hosts of our enemies, with terrible force and cruel fury, carried us
   away captives. We were violently borne away, with all the goods which
   we possessed, into a land of forgetful-ness and captivity forever.

   Christ, who had lost nothing by this, nevertheless being a "brother
   born for adversity," pursued our haughty foes. He overtook them. He
   struck them with His mighty hand--He took their spoil and returned with
   crimsoned vesture, leading captivity captive. He restored that which He
   took not away. I think, as I see Abram returning from the slaughter of
   the four kings, I see in him a picture of a greater than Abram,
   returning "from Edom, with dyed garments from Boz-rah, traveling in the
   greatness of His strength" who answers to my inquiry of who is he? "I
   that speak in righteousness, mighty to save." Abram was that righteous
   man raised in the East, to whom God gave his enemies as driven stubble
   to his bow.

   And so the Lord Jesus has driven our enemies like chaff over to the
   wind, for they fled at the Presence of Jehovah Jesus, and by the valor
   of the atoning Lamb they have been utterly broken in pieces forever.
   Let that thought dwell with you--it may furnish you with matter for
   meditation at your leisure. We shall this morning rather consider Abram
   as the type and picture of all the faithful. He was the father of the
   faithful. And in his history you have condensed--as I think-- history
   of all faithful men. You will scarcely find a trial which will befall
   you which has not in some respect happened to Abraham.

   I will not say that he was tempted in all points like as we are, but he
   was tempted in so many points that he well deserves to be called the
   father of the faithful--being partaker of flesh and blood even as all
   the children are who belong to his faithful family. Observe then, in
   handling our subject in this manner, that Believers are frequently
   engaged in warfare. Notice, secondly, that when they are thus engaged
   they may expect to be met by their Lord, the great Melchizedek! And
   remember, thirdly, that when they are favored with an interview with
   Him and are refreshed by Him as with bread and wine, then, like Abram,
   they consecrate themselves anew and as Abram gave tithes of all, even
   so do they.

   I. We mention, then, what you must all know right well by
   experience--you who are God's people--that the Believer is often
   engaged in warfare. This warfare will be both within and
   without--within with the innumerable natural corruptions which
   remain--with the temptations of Satan, with the suggestions of his own
   wicked heart. And without he will frequently be engaged in warfare,
   wrestling "not against flesh and blood, but against principalities,
   against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world,
   against spiritual wickedness in high places."

   The peculiar case of Abram leads me to remark that sometimes the
   Believer will be engaged in warfare, not so much on his own account as
   on the account of erring Brethren who, having gone into ill company,
   are by-and-by carried away captive. It was no quarrel of Abram's--it
   was Lot's matter. Lot had gone to Sodom. Instead of standing in the
   separated path of the true Believer he had joined himself to the world.
   And when evil days came Lot was carried away captive with the rest.

   Abram cared little enough for the king of Sodom--I do not suppose he
   would have taken his sword from the sheath for all the men who dwelt in
   Admah or Zeboim. But for Lot's sake, seeing him in ill company and in
   danger, he draws the sword. And sometimes, Brethren, when we see those
   who are God's servants putting themselves into alliance with evil
   systems, we find them carried away captive and taken where we believe
   their hearts would never go. And so we feel compelled to come out and
   draw the sword against the common enemy of Christ and of all His
   people. And though they may heartily wish that we would let them alone
   in their sin and let them be quiet in their evil union, we see into
   what spiritual capacity it leads them and we cannot be silent. We must
   draw the sword when conscience and when God demand it and never sheath
   it until God's work is done.

   However, this rarely occurs. For the most part the Christian spends his
   sword's edge upon his own spiritual foes-- and truly we have enough of
   these. What with pride, sloth, lust--what with the arch enemy of souls
   and his insinuations and blasphemies--the lust of the eyes, the
   pleasures of this world and the pride of life--what with enemies who
   come upon us even from Providence in the shape of temptations arising
   out of our trials and our vocations, we ought to carry our sword always
   drawn! And, above all, we should ever carry the shield of faith and
   take the weapon of all-prayer.

   The Christian is never to feel himself at ease so long as he is on this
   side of Jordan. This is an enemy's land. Expect a foe behind every
   bush. Look to hear the shot come whistling by and each night adore
   almighty Grace that you have not fallen prey to your cruel and
   remorseless foes. The Christian is engaged throughout his whole life as
   a soldier--he is so called in Scripture--"A good soldier of Jesus
   Christ." And if any of you take the trouble to write out the passages
   of Scripture in which the Christian is described as a soldier and
   provision is made for his being armed and directions given for his
   warfare, you will be surprised to find there are more of this character
   than concerning any other metaphor by which the Christian is described
   in the Word of God!

   His chief and main business seems to be, like his Master, to bear
   witness for the Truth of God. "For this purpose was I born and sent
   into the world." And though in himself a man of peace, yet he can say
   with his Master, "I came not to send peace but a sword." Wherever he
   goes he finds that his presence is the signal for war--war within him
   and war outside him--he is a man of peace and yet a man of war because
   a man of peace. The Christian is engaged in warfare with sin, Satan,
   error and falsehood and sometimes he is called to fight for erring
   friends.

   Observe that this war is one against powerful odds. The four kings
   mentioned in this chapter were all great sovereigns. From what little
   we can glean from profane history, they appear to have been very mighty
   monarchs and they must have been assisted by very valiant armies to
   have struck the giants whose names are mentioned in the opening verses.
   They appear to have carried away the five kings of the plain with the
   greatest possible ease. Yet here is Abram, who has little more than
   three hundred of his own armed servants at his call--and yet he
   ventures against the embattled thousands of the kings of nations!

   Such is the warfare of the Christian--he has to contend against foes
   far too many for him--he is like the worm that is to arise and thrash
   the mountain. He is little and despised and if he measures his own
   strength he will find it to be perfect weakness. And yet, for all this,
   he anticipates a victory and like Abram hastens to the holy war.
   Carefully notice that as it is a battle of fearful odds, it is one
   which is carried on in faith. Abram did not venture to this fight with
   confidence in his own strength, or reliance upon his own bow. He went
   in the name of the Lord of Hosts. Faith was Abram's continual comfort.
   Sometimes his faith failed, as it will in the best, but still, the
   spirit of the man's life was a simple confidence upon God--whom he had
   not seen--but whose voice he cheerfully obeyed.

   The Christian is to carry on his warfare in faith. You will be
   vanquished, indeed, if you attempt it by any other method! Brethren,
   there is not a sin in your heart which will not master you if you seek
   to fight it by resolutions of your own. Faith in the precious blood of
   Christ must win you the victory and the world will laugh you to scorn
   if you assail it with any other weapons than such as Calvary will
   furnish you. "This is the victory which overcomes the world, even our
   faith." And if you ask Faith what weapon she uses, her reply is, "They
   overcame through the blood of the Lamb." Live near to Jesus Christ.
   Rest upon the power of His Atonement and the prevalence of His
   plea--and then go forward against every enemy without and every foe
   within--and you shall be more than a conqueror!

   In this great battle, carried on by faith, Abram had a right given him
   from God and the promise of God's Presence virtually in that right.
   What business had Chedorlaomer to come to Canaan? Had not Jehovah said
   to Abram, "All this land will I give unto you"? Therefore he and his
   confederate monarchs were neither more nor less than intruders. For
   thirteen years they might have exercised sovereignty over the cities of
   the plain, but those cities and everything around them belonged
   virtually to Abram. It is true they would have laughed at the very idea
   of Abram's claiming the whole land of Canaan, but that claim was
   nevertheless valid in the court of Heaven and the Patriarch, by Divine
   right, was heir of all the land.

   Christian, you are, by virtue of a Covenant made with you to drive out
   every sin as an intruder. "Sin shall not have dominion over you: for
   you are not under the Law, but under Grace." You are to drive out every
   error, for you are a servant of the Truth of God and the Truth alone
   has a right to live and a right to exist. And in fighting this lawful
   warfare you may expect that the right arm of the Most High God--the
   Possessor of Heaven and earth--will be bared that He may show Himself
   strong on behalf of all those who are valiant for His Truth and for His
   name. Fear not! The battle is not yours, but God's. You go not to a
   warfare at your own charges. And though Hell may roar, as it will, and
   earth be all in arms--and your own heart may fail you and your flesh,
   when you take counsel with it, makes you feel a coward-- yet say, "In
   the name of God will I destroy them," and go forward and conquer! "They
   compass me about like bees," said David, "yes, like bees they compass
   me about: but in the name of God will I destroy them." And what David
   did you shall do through David's God!

   Yet more--the Christian is engaged in a conflict in which he walks by
   faith and leans upon God. But yet it is a conflict in which he uses all
   means, calls in all lawful assistance and exerts himself with all vigor
   and speed. Abram did not sit still and say, "Well, God will deliver
   Lot. He has promised to keep His servants as the apple of His eye." Oh,
   no, that is not faith--that is foolish presumption! Abram did not take
   his time about it and go marching leisurely after the foe, nor did he
   go without the assistance of his friends, Aner and Eshcol and Mamre. So
   the Christian, if he sees any method by which he may be assisted in
   overcoming sin or promoting the Truth of God, uses it with wisdom and
   discretion. He trusts in God as though he did nothing himself and yet
   he does everything as if all depended upon himself. He knows that good
   works cannot save him and he equally knows that he is not saved unless
   there are some fruits of good works.

   He understands that the means of Grace cannot of themselves convey
   Grace to him and yet at the same time he never despises them but looks
   to find a blessing in the use of them. He understands that the ministry
   and private prayer and the searching of the Scriptures cannot save
   him--but he also understands that thus using them helps which God has
   given him and diligently pressing forward and setting a bold face
   before the foe--he is in the path of God's ordinances and may expect to
   have God's help. And do observe, dear Friends, yet again, that Abram
   marching on thus with activity and using discretion--by attacking his
   enemies at night rather than by day--did not cease until he had gained
   a complete victory over them.

   It was not enough to strike them at one corner of their host, nor
   merely to deliver Lot. Now that he is come out against them he will win
   a sure and decisive victory. O Beloved, you and I are never to sit
   still and say, "It is enough." Have I struck my drunkenness? Have I
   overcome by blaspheming habits? Am I delivered from Sabbath-breaking?
   Have I become honest and chaste? Yet this is not where I should stop.
   Have I sought to bring down my self-conceit, my pride, my sloth? It is
   well and good but let me never be satisfied with any attainment short
   of absolute perfection. We do not believe we shall be perfect in this
   life, but we will never be satisfied until we are. "Onward," is the
   Christian's motto! As long as there is one sin which is not removed we
   will fight and cry and groan and go to the Cross concerning it.

   As long as there is one soul in this world unsaved, we will wrestle
   with the Mighty One of Jacob to stretch out His hand to save it! So
   long as there remains one error upon earth--so long as we have a tongue
   to speak and God gives us Grace--we will bear our witness against it.
   In this battle there is no keeping back our hand till the victory is
   wholly won. We must bring back the goods and the men and the women and
   Lot and the whole company--the victory must be complete. More than
   conquerors must we be through Him who has loved us. Let us anticipate
   the time when it shall be so.

   O Brethren, I think I see the victors ascending the starry steeps in
   triumphal state! Christ at their head rides gloriously! He who loved
   them leads the van. The gates open to Him as the great Conqueror who
   has led their captivity captive. I think I see the glad faces of all
   those soldiers of the Cross as they enter the portals of eternal
   peace--

   "I ask them where their victory came.
   They with united breath,
   Ascribe their conquest to the Lamb,
   Their triumph to His death."

   See, then, Beloved, you are this morning soldiers! You are to fight by
   faith in God. However tremendous the power of your adversaries, you are
   not to fear since God is with you. You are to fight using discretion as
   your armor-bearer, but you are also to couple this with perseverance,
   continuing faithful to the end, for only those who overcome shall sit
   upon the Throne of God forever!

   We have thus, perhaps, said enough concerning this first point and now
   may the Holy Spirit bedew with His holy influences while we talk of the
   second, for otherwise it will be only talk.

   II. While engaged in such earnest spiritual contention the Believer may
   expect to see his Lord. When Shadrach, Me-shach and Abednego were
   fighting Christ's battles in the fiery furnace, then the Son of Man
   appeared to them. As in the building of Jerusalem in troublous times
   they had the sword in one hand and the trowel in the other, so our Lord
   Jesus Christ, while He teaches us to use the sword, takes care to edify
   and build us up in the faith at the same time! He understands that
   warriors require strengthening meat and that especially when they are
   under stern conflict they need extraordinary comforts that their souls
   may be stayed and refreshed.

   Why does Jesus Christ, as set forth here under the type of Melchizedek,
   appear unto His children in times of conflict? Answer--He comes to
   them, first, because they are weary. In every conflict which the child
   of God has to wage, it is not the private person who goes to the
   warfare--it virtually is Christ fighting--Christ contending. It is a
   member of Christ's body laboring against Christ's enemy for the glory
   of the Head. Christ the Head has an intense feeling of sympathy with
   every member, no matter how humble. Since there is a vital union
   between Christ and every member, there is also an undying sympathy. And
   whenever, Brothers and Sisters, you contend for the faith till you grow
   weary, Jesus Christ will be sure to give you some proof of His close
   communion with you.

   The martyrs proclaim that they never had such communion with God
   anywhere as among the caverns of the hills, or the swamps of the woods
   to which they were exiled for Christ. And even on the rack, in
   extremity of torture, or even upon the gridiron in the heat of the
   fire--even there the sweet Presence of Christ has been overpoweringly
   delightful to them so that they almost lost the sense of pain! You,
   Lord, do send a plenteous rain whereby You refresh Your heritage when
   it is weary! Spend your strength for God, Brothers and Sisters, for
   when fainting seems inevitable, then shall come such a sweet renewing
   of your strength that, like an eagle, you shall stretch your wings and
   mount aloft to commune with God in solitary joys! Christ, your
   Melchizedek, will meet you in your conflicts if He never did before!

   The King of Peace met the returning warrior for another reason. Abram
   was probably flushed with victory and this is a very dangerous feeling
   for any child of God. When the seventy disciples returned to Christ
   they said, with evident exultation, "Lord, even the devils are subject
   unto us." But Jesus Christ sweetly and gently rebuked them by saying,
   "Nevertheless, rejoice not in this, but rather rejoice because your
   names are written in Heaven." The true secret of a Christian's joy is
   not to be his conquest over sin or over error, but the Person of his
   Lord Jesus Christ! The Lord knows that His people, if they are
   successful even in spiritual warfare--when they have used the best of
   means and felt the best of motives--are, nevertheless, very liable to
   the intoxication of pride. And therefore He either sends "a thorn in
   the flesh," or else, what is better still, He comes Himself!

   I am persuaded, Beloved, that the best cure for pride is a sight of
   Christ. Oh, when your eyes see Him, then your own loathsomeness,
   blackness and deformity are clearly revealed. I am fair until I see the
   sun--then--then am I black, indeed! I think myself pure until I see Him
   whiter than any fuller could make Him and then I fall down and cry,
   "Unclean, unclean, unclean!" "Now my eye sees You," said Job, "why I
   abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes." Down go your flaunting
   banners and your lofty plumes when you have a sight of Christ! No
   humbler man than George Herbert--no humbler man than Samuel
   Rutherford--and these were men who lived close to Christ. Christ's
   Presence is a cure-all.

   When Melchizedek comes every spiritual disease flies before Him. The
   Church at Laodicean was very far gone and how did the Master propose to
   cure it? Here it is--"Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if any man
   hears My voice and opens the door, I will come into him and will sup
   with him." What? Lord, is this Your delightful treatment of Your sick
   Church? "Yes, My communion with you, poor lukewarm Laodicean, will
   revive you." Truly that is a most suggestive figure by which John
   describes the countenance of Christ--he says, "His countenance was as
   the sun shining in his strength." So, Lord, it does not matter how dark
   I am, the moment You show Your face, all must be light! This, I think,
   was the reason why the King of Righteousness met Abram--to turn away
   his thoughts from the tempting joys of victory to his sure portion in
   the Most High God, possessor of Heaven and earth.

   Yet again, was not this visit bestowed because Abram was about to be
   tried in a yet more subtle manner than he had been before? It is easier
   to fight Chedorlaomer than to resist the King of Sodom. Joshua down in
   the plain never grew weary when he was fighting the Amalekites, but
   Moses on the mountain felt his hands grow heavy. Why? Because the more
   spiritual the exercise, the more apt are we to grow weary in it. And so
   the more spiritual the temptation the more likelihood of our becoming a
   prey to it and the more strength do we need to overcome it. That was a
   very subtle temptation to Lot, by the King of Sodom. Why it looked so
   right--perfectly right. Abram has brought back these captives-- he has
   a right to the spoil--he ought, therefore, to take it. If he had done
   so, no one would blame him on ordinary rules. But there is a higher
   rule for Believers than for other men!

   Brethren, I contend that the common rules of morality are binding upon
   all--but that a supernaturally high rule of morality should regulate
   the Christian! The Christian is not allowed to wink at an evil because
   he has educated his conscience not to think it so--but he shall so act
   that there shall not be any wrong in the action upon the common
   judgment of any unbiased spectator. He who is of the King's Council
   must walk very daintily lest he offend his Master. I tell you, from
   experience, that the nearer you come to Christ and the more you have of
   communion with Him, the more jealous you must be of yourself, or else,
   if other men escape the rod you will not--you will have to smart for it
   behind the door where another may not see nor understand your grief.

   Beloved, it is well to have communion with Christ to prepare us against
   subtle temptations, for to feed us upon Mel-chizedek's bread and wine
   is to make us more than a match for the King of Sodom. O Jesus! When I
   have seen Your face, my soul beholds not the dazzling beauties of
   earthly excellence. Brothers and Sisters, if ever you have seen
   Christ's face, that painted harlot, the world, will never win your love
   again! Did you ever eat the pure white bread of Heaven? Then the brown
   gritty bread of earth will never suit you but will break your teeth
   with gravel stones. You will never care to drink earth's sour and
   watery wine if you have once been made to drink of the wines on the
   lees well refined--the spiced wine of Christ's pomegranate. If you want
   to be strengthened against the most subtle worldly temptations, cry,
   "Let Him kiss me with the kisses of His mouth: for Your love is better
   than wine." And you may go forth to conflicts of every kind more than a
   conqueror, through Him that has loved you!

   Thus we have spoken upon the fact that Melchizedek met Abram and the
   reasons. Now, let us look a little more closely at what he did. In what
   character did he meet Abram? The reply is easy--he met him as one
   possessed of a royal priesthood. Christ meets us, Brethren, as a Priest
   and a King in all our battles. What a mercy it is that Christ visits us
   as a Priest, for we never fight against sin without being in some
   measure partakers of it. I do not believe there ever was a controversy
   for the Truth of God upon which any gracious man, though engaged upon
   the right side, could look back without some regrets and some tears.

   I much believe that even Martin Luther or John Knox, when upon their
   dying beds, though never regretting that they contended earnestly for
   the faith yet felt that while they were in the flesh something of flesh
   mingled with all that they did. Thus it will be to the end and even
   when contending against our own sins and lusts. Yet, Beloved, our very
   repentance has something in it to be repented of and our very flying to
   the Cross has something in it of a lingering from the Cross and
   therefore something of evil. Jesus, all hail! How much I need to meet
   You as a priest! And you, Beloved, do you not feel that you need Him,
   too? Do you not, as you look upon Calvary and the flowing blood,
   confess that you need, in all spiritual conflicts, to meet Christ?

   But Melchizedek was also a king and truly thus we want to view our Lord
   whenever we are fighting His battles. "The Lord reigns," is perhaps one
   of the most comforting texts in the compass of God's Word to the
   contending Christian. "Ah," says the poor soul, "I am trod under foot
   of Satan, but rejoice not over me, O my enemy--though I fall, yet shall
   I rise again, for the Lord reigns!" Oh, that is our consolation when at
   any time we think we are routed! When we see our Church dismayed and
   our banner trailed in the mire--we then remember Jesus, for Him has God
   the Father exalted, "and given Him a name which is above every name:
   that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in Heaven
   and things in earth and things under the earth."

   Hail, King of Righteousness and Peace, much do we need to meet You!
   Come, mount Your glorious chariot, ride forth conquering and to conquer
   drawn by Your three white horses, Meekness, Truth and Righteousness!
   Heaven adores

   You, earth obeys You, Hell trembles at Your Presence! Gates of brass
   must burst at Your touch and bars of iron snap at Your Word! O King
   Immortal, ride gloriously and let Your people behold You and rejoice in
   You. But we must see Christ, see Him, by close communion with Him. You
   cannot see Him by my description. Melchizedek met Abram and Jesus
   Christ must meet you. He must stop you all of a sudden, when you least
   expect it, and reveal Himself to you as He does not unto the world.

   Jacob, before wrestling, was met by hosts of angels at Mahanaim--but
   what are these when compared with the Lord Himself? There is a high
   blessing in being met by angels--do not mistake me there--but oh, to be
   met by the Angel of the Covenant, the Michael the Archangel, to be met
   by Him! Ah, what comfort is here! And will He meet me? Will He meet
   you? Yes, we can answer, He will--for we have met with Him. "My eyes
   have seen the King in His beauty." Many of us can say that and our
   souls are exceedingly comforted and full of holy joy because we have
   beheld Him as Priest and King.

   The next inquiry is what did he do for him? He brought him bread and
   wine, precisely setting forth what Jesus does, who brings us His flesh
   and His blood. Carnal people say in order to understand Christ's words,
   that when you eat bread and drink wine at the Lord's Table, there is
   His flesh in the bread, or that the bread is transubstantiated into
   flesh and the same with the wine. But the spiritual mind understands
   that these emblems awaken the spiritual powers and that the spiritual
   powers--not the lips and the stomach, but the spiritual powers--do
   really and spiritually feed upon the flesh and blood of Jesus Christ
   and so the Word is fulfilled--"Except you eat My flesh and drink My
   blood, there is no life in you."

   I do not know that Christian people feed altogether on doctrine. I know
   that the Truth of God is food, but Believers get richer nourishment
   than even this affords. When I am very gloomy I like to take down some
   work upon the high doctrines--God's Sovereignty, election,
   perseverance--and I get comforted. But there are other times when I am
   brought very low and that kind of food will not suit me. I am obliged
   then to turn to my Lord Himself. There is, I believe, in times of
   conflict, no food which can be the stay of an immortal soul except the
   Master Himself--communion with Him--a putting of the fingers into the
   print of the nails and a thrusting of the hand into the side. This is
   the sovereign remedy for unbelief and the best food for faith. His
   manifest Presence is our noblest nutriment.

   When Christ reveals Himself, all grows calm and peaceful. But until we
   can get Him we still abide in darkness and we see no light. The
   worshiper who came up to the temple could not live upon the brazen
   laver, nor the golden snuffers, nor even upon the cherubic emblems--he
   must partake with the priests of the lamb offered in sacrifice! And so
   the true food of the child of God is Jesus Christ Himself--not so much
   ordinances and doctrines, which are only the utensils and the
   vestments--but Christ Himself! The very Christ, made flesh for us,
   received with joy into our soul and fed upon, until, like Abram, we go
   on our way rejoicing. That is what the royal priest did for the
   Patriarch.

   Bear with me patiently while I remark what Melchizedek said to him.
   First he blessed him and then he blessed God and that is just what we
   need our Lord to do for us. We want our Lord Jesus Christ first to
   bless us. "Blessed be Abram of the Most High God, possessor of Heaven
   and earth." We need a blessing upon our own persons and especially upon
   our own works. What are our works when we have done them all but futile
   vanity until God comes to strengthen us? Beloved, you and I may contend
   for Christ until we are dumb but not a soul will see the light or know
   the Truth of God by our witness of itself! We may go with tender hearts
   and seek to bring sinners to the Cross of Christ, but we shall never
   bring a sinner unless God's own arm is revealed.

   We shall come back like the Prophet, saying, "Who has believed our
   report?" And feeling that the arm of God has not been revealed unto
   men. But when, on the other hand, the Possessor of Heaven and earth has
   blessed us, then our earthly substance is blessed and our earthly words
   are blessed and then we get a heavenly blessing! Heaven's rest and
   peace--Heaven's Omnipotence rest upon us and in the glory of a
   Heaven-given strength we go forth confident of victory. We want a
   blessing from Christ. Ask for it now, Beloved! Ask for it now, you who
   are weary with last week's fighting, you who can scarcely endure any
   longer by reason of your trials and troubles! Say to Him now,
   "Melchizedek, bless me! O Jesus, bless me now!"

   Possessor of Heaven and earth, forget not one of us, Your beloved ones,
   but give us a blessing! Beloved Brethren, Melchizedek did not stop
   there, but he fulfilled another part of his priestly office--he blessed
   God. Whenever we are singing here, when I am in right order, my soul
   takes wing and wants to fly to Heaven! When we all sing with power and
   force there is a sweetness and grandeur about the song which we do not
   often meet. Yet I am always conscious that we cannot praise God as He
   deserves to be and herein I bless the great Melchizedek that though we
   cannot bless God as He should be blessed, yet He can! Jesus Christ
   presents the praises of His saints before God as well as their prayers.
   He is the Intercessor and while He has the vials full of odors sweet to
   present, He also presents the music of our harps. Both our offerings
   come up accepted in the Beloved.

   Now what do you say, Brethren? Have you done anything this week that is
   of good repute? Has God given you any success? Dear Sister, have you
   won any souls for Christ? I know you have! Dear Brother, has God
   blessed you in any witness-bearing? Have you felt that God has been
   with you? Well now, come and lay your honors down at His feet, whatever
   they may be! Put them there and pray the great Melchizedek to take out
   of your heart every particle of self-glory and every atom of
   self-exaltation and ask Him to say for you in a higher sense than ever
   you can say it, "Blessed be the Most High God, possessor of Heaven and
   earth who has delivered my enemies into my hand." Thus you shall be
   glad that the great Melchizedek has met you!

   I have talked thus, but truly one word from the lips of Christ will be
   worth ten thousand of mine! And if you ever have seen Him, you will
   think me a very dauber when I try to paint Him. If you get this day so
   much as ten minutes real fellowship with Jesus, you will wonder how it
   is, that I, if I know anything about Him, could talk in this cold way!
   Go your way, Brethren, and pray Melchizedek will meet you!

   III. Lastly, and very briefly, indeed, since our time is gone--when a
   wrestling Believer is favored with a sight of the great
   Melchizedek--voluntarily and yet necessarily he makes a new dedication
   of himself to God. You see Abram does not appear to delay a moment but
   he gives to Melchizedek a tithe of all, by which he seemed to say, "I
   own the authority of my superior liege lord, to all that I am and all
   that I have." There is one of our hymns which says--

   "Hail, Melchizedek Divine! You, great High Priest, shall be mine. All
   my powers before You fall Take not tithe, but take them all." And truly
   our holy faith deserves that we should give all to Christ!

   I would that some Christians, however, practiced the rule of giving a
   tenth of their substance to the Lord's cause. The Lord's Church need
   never lack if you had a bag in which you stored up for Christ--when you
   gave anything, you would not feel it was giving of your own--your left
   hand would not know what your right hand did, for you would be taking
   out of the Lord's stock which you had already consecrated to the Lord's
   cause. Not less than one-tenth should be the Lord's portion, especially
   with those who have.

   And more than this, I think, should be expected of those who have
   wealth. But there is no rule binding with iron force upon you for we
   are not under Law in Christ's Church, but under Grace and Grace will
   prompt you to do more than Law might suggest. But certainly the
   Christian should reckon himself to be not his own and that he has
   nothing to retain for his own private account. I pray God if I have a
   drop of blood in my body which is not His, to let it bleed away! And if
   there is one hair in my head which is not consecrated to Him, I would
   have it plucked out--for it must be the devil's drop of blood and the
   devil's hair. It belongs to either one or the other--if not to God,
   then to Satan. No, we must, Brethren, have no division of ourselves--no
   living unto this world and unto God, too.

   Mark Anthony yoked two lions together and drove them through the
   streets of Rome--they do strange things at Rome and there are many
   people who can yoke two lions together and drive towards Rome. But you
   will never be able to yoke the lion of the tribe of Judah and the lion
   of Hell together--they are at deadly antagonism and Christ will not
   have you for His servants if you seek to serve two masters. I know that
   any talk of mine here will be in vain, but if, Beloved, you should see
   Christ and have communion with Him, your consecration to Him will be a
   matter of course. I will suppose that this afternoon one of you should
   sit down in your arm chair and, as you are sitting there, you will be
   thinking, "How little I have been giving of late to the cause of
   Christ! How seldom I have opened my mouth for Him!"

   Perhaps you will think, "I have got on in the world, too, but I really
   cannot afford it! My expenses are so great!" Suppose the Lord Jesus
   Christ should come into the room with those pierced hands and bleeding
   feet--suppose He were to remind you of what He has done for you--how He
   visited you in your low estate when your heart was breaking under a
   sense of sin? You would not tell Him you could not afford to give to
   His cause! Suppose our Lord Jesus Christ should look you in the face
   and say to you, "I have done all this for you. What will you do for
   Me?" What would be your answer? Why, you would say, "Take it all, my
   Master, take it all, all that I am and all that I have shall be forever
   Yours."

   Or, if you felt niggardly--supposing He should say to you, "If you will
   never ask anything of Me, I will never take anything from you." Would
   you agree to that? No! Because you still will have immense demands to
   make upon His liberality cease not to give your whole spirit, soul and
   body as a whole burnt-offering unto God. As Abram did before
   Mel-chizedek so you do in the Presence of Christ. Admit that you are
   His and give yourself to Him. My dear Brethren, I pray God that this
   may stir you up to seek a high grade of piety and to live in daily
   communion with a living Savior and He will bless and keep you.

   But there are some of you who are not like Abram. You need not hope,
   yet, to see Melchizedek. There are some of you strangers, far off. Ah,
   I may rather compare you to the men of Sodom! Christ has done something
   for you as Abram did for Sodom. You know it was only for the sake of
   Lot that He brought them back, but He did bring them all back and for
   the sake of Lot gave a respite to them all--although a few years after
   they had grown so wicked that they were all destroyed. My Master has
   given a respite to free you all. While His great work was the salvation
   of His own chosen, yet He has spared you all in the land of the living.
   Take heed lest you do as did the men of Sodom, for then a hail more
   fiery, a destruction more terrible must come upon you, seeing that you
   turn not aside from your evil ways, nor seek His face.

   Trust Christ and you are saved! Believe in Him and your sins are
   forgiven. But if you refuse, beware lest that come upon you which is
   written in the Prophets, "Behold, you despisers and wonder and perish!"
   The Master now send us away with His benediction. Amen.

                         The Backslider'S Way Hedged Up

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 18, 1864, BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   She said, I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread and my water,
   my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink. Therefore, behold, I will
   hedge up your way with thorns and make a wall, that she shall not find
   her paths. And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not
   overtake them. And she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then
   shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was
   it better with me than now." Hosea 2:5-7.

   GREAT and grievous was the apostasy of the seed of Abraham from the
   Lord their God. They had been chosen by special Grace from among all
   people and had the high honor to receive the oracles of God--yet they
   were bent on backsliding from God and were unfaithful to the Most High.
   The gods of the surrounding heathen were constantly a snare to them and
   they forsook the only living and true God to prostrate themselves
   before blocks of wood and stone. Though chastened a thousand times they
   learned nothing by the rod. And though as frequently forgiven and
   visited with mercy, the holy bonds of gratitude did not bind them to
   their God. As an abandoned woman leaves a kind and tender husband for
   the base love of the vilest of the vile, even so both Israel and Judah
   played the harlot towards the Lord who had espoused them in infinite
   love.

   Yet God has not even now written a bill of divorcement, or cast away
   the people whom He did foreknow. Through eighteen hundred years the
   sons of Israel have had to wander to and fro without a settled dwelling
   place, yet God has not utterly given them up or broken His Covenant
   with them. For the day shall come when Israel shall return, when again
   she shall be called Hephzibah, and her land Beulah. Come, long expected
   day! Appear, glorious King of the Jews! And you, O Judah, return from
   your captivity! Shake yourself from the dust--put on your beautiful
   garments and salute the Lord, your Ishi, your tender loving Husband!

   Beloved Brothers and Sisters, the apostasy of the children of Israel
   has been recorded for our learning. As they were prone to wander, so
   are we--and the methods by which God brought them back of old are
   precisely those which He uses with His erring children at the present
   day. Instead of wondering at Israel's wickedness, let us examine
   ourselves and repent for our sins! And while we see the hand of God
   upon them, let us learn to admire those methods of unerring wisdom by
   which Divine love preserves the ransomed ones from going down into the
   pit.

   In considering our text, my aim will be to be used as the Holy Spirit's
   instrument to arouse, instruct and restore backsliders. Such wanderers
   may be present now. Their first love they have lost and their zeal is
   quenched. There may be some here who have gone further still and have
   forsaken the Church of God altogether, having given up their profession
   and all attendance upon Divine worship. O that the voice of Israel's
   God may be heard in their hearts this morning, crying, "If a man puts
   away his wife and she goes from him and becomes another man's, shall he
   return unto her again? Shall not that land be greatly polluted? But you
   have played the harlot with many lovers, yet return again to Me, says
   the Lord."

   I. We commence the consideration of the passage before us with the
   remark that WHILE SINFUL MEN ARE IN PROSPERITY THEY PERVERT THE MERCIES
   OF GOD TO THEIR OWN INJURY, making them instruments of sin and weapons
   of warfare against God. While the children of Israel enjoyed an
   abundance of temporal comforts they ascribed all these blessings to
   their false gods. Hear the wicked and treacherous words--"I will go
   after my lovers who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax,
   my oil and my drink." Oh, base ingratitude to their bounteous Jehovah!
   Infamous ascription of His Glory to graven images!

   Prosperous sinners make three great mistakes. At the outset they give
   their temporal mercies the first place in their hearts. Because their
   business prospers they do not consider that their soul is perishing!
   Because there is enough on the table for themselves and for their
   children they forget that their soul is famished for lack of Heaven's
   bread! They put the shadows of time before the realities of eternity.
   They say, "We must live." But they forget that they must also die. So
   long as the current glides smoothly and the gentle flow of the river of
   their joy is undisturbed they forget the waterfall, red with the blood
   of souls, down whose tremendous steeps those treacherous waters will
   soon hurry them!

   Is it not a gross mistake to attach so much importance to this poor
   body of clay and forget the priceless jewel of the immortal soul? Why
   do you think so much of a world in which we only tarry for a few evil
   years and neglect the world where we must dwell forever? Such folly is
   most shameful in one who was once a professed Christian, because he
   knew, or professed to know, somewhat of the superiority of the eternal
   over the temporal. He supposedly knew of the vanity of things earthly
   and the glory of things heavenly.

   Yet because things go well with him--because his wife is in health, his
   children blooming, his house well furnished, his property increasing,
   he says, "Soul, take your ease," and disturbs not himself though Heaven
   is black with lowering tempest and the light of God's countenance is
   hidden from him. The loss of God's Presence, the man thinks to be a
   trifle because he is succeeding in the world--as though a man should
   count it nothing to lose his life if he may but keep his raiment whole
   to be buried in!

   O Fools, why do you put the last things first and the first things
   last? One error leads to another and therefore such people hold their
   temporal things upon a wrong tenure. Do observe how many times the word
   "my" is found in the text. "Give me my bread and my water and my wool
   and my flax, my oil and my drink." Why, they were not hers but God's,
   for the Lord expressly claims them all in the ninth verse and threatens
   to take them all away! Backslider, there was a time when you did
   confess yourself to be God's steward--when you said, "I am not my own,
   but bought with a price." Yet now you have so set your heart upon
   worldly things that all your talk runs in this fashion--my horses, my
   houses, my lands, my profits, my children and an endless list of things
   which you think to be altogether yours.

   Why, Man, they are not yours! They are only lent you for a season! You
   are but God's under-bailiff. You have possession only as
   tenant-at-will, or as a borrower holding a loan. The Lord claims even
   now the prior right to all you have and the day shall come when He
   shall show you this! For if He has mercy upon you--and I pray He
   may--He may take these from you one by one and make you cry out in
   abject wretchedness of soul, "O God, forgive me that I made these my
   gods and claimed them as my own!"

   Then further, backsliders are apt to ascribe their prosperity and their
   mercies to their sins. I have even heard one say, "Ever since I gave up
   a profession of religion I have made more headway in business than I
   did before." Some apostates have boasted, "Since I broke through
   Puritanical restraint and went out into worldly company, I have been
   better in spirits and better in purse than ever I was before." Thus
   they ascribe the mercies which God has given them to their sins and
   wickedly bow down before their lusts, as Israel did before the golden
   calf and cry, "These are your gods, O Israel, which brought us up out
   of the land of Egypt!"

   Sinner, if you did but know it, a long-suffering God has given you
   these things! Even to you who will perish He has given many mercies as
   your portion in this life, seeing that you have no heritage hereafter.
   O take heed, lest you be fattened upon them as beasts for the
   slaughter. Unto you, Backsliders, He has given these things to try you,
   to see how far you will go--to what extravagances of ingratitude you
   will descend and how far you will despise His tender means. O
   Backslider, is it not marvelous that God has not long ago stretched you
   upon a bed of sickness, when you consider how much you have brought
   dishonor upon Christ's name--how you have vexed God's people--how you
   have made the wicked open their mouths against God?

   Is it not a wonder that He did not take you away with a stroke when you
   first forsook Him? And yet, see--instead of this, He multiplies your
   mercies! Does He not as good as say, "Return unto your rest for I have
   dealt bountifully with you. I am married unto you and therefore I treat
   you as a husband treats his spouse. Although I might well proclaim a
   divorce against you, yet since I have betrothed you unto Me forever, My
   goodness and mercy shall not leave you even in your sins." Herein lies
   the gross mistake of the backslider--that he will attribute his present
   happiness and comfort to his sins rather than to the forbearance of
   God.

   Here are three great errors and oh, I fear they are so deadly that
   unless God interposes in Providence and in Grace, they will be as fatal
   as the three darts which Joab thrust through the heart of Absalom as he
   was dangling by his proud hair in the wood of Ephraim! I fear that the
   goodly Babylonian garment and the talents of silver and the wedge of
   gold will ruin you as they did Achan of old. These three falsehoods,
   like the three daughters of the horseleech, will never be satisfied
   until they have utterly destroyed your soul! You will be wrapped in
   fine linen and fare sumptuously and all this shall but ensure you the
   torments of the damned.

   Go now, weep and howl for the miseries which shall come upon you--your
   riches are corrupted! Your garments are moth-eaten! Your gold and
   silver are cankered and the rust of them shall be a witness against you
   and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. You have forsaken the right
   way and are gone astray--following the way of Balaam who loved the
   wages of unrighteousness. Hear the Word of the Lord by the mouth of His
   servant Peter! Tremble at it and be afraid--"If after they have escaped
   the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and
   Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein and overcome, the
   latter end is worse with them than the beginning. For it had been
   better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after
   they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto
   them. But it is happened unto them according to the proverb, The dog is
   turned to his own vomit again. And the sow that was washed, to her
   wallowing in the mire."

   II. Let us turn from this gloomy side of our subject and observe with
   gratitude that THE LORD INTERPOSES

   ADVERSITY IN ORDER TO BRING BACK HIS WANDERING CHILDREN. Let us
   consider for a moment the hindrances which a God of Love frequently
   puts in the way of His elect when they backslide from Him. Here we have
   the matter opened up to our attention. "Therefore, behold, I will hedge
   up your way with thorns and make a wall, that she shall not find her
   paths."

   Here you see that it is an unexpected hindrance, for it is placed right
   in the woman's way--"I will hedge up your way"--it was her way, her
   habit--she had fallen into it and she meant to keep on. But suddenly
   she met with an unlooked-for obstacle. Just as farmers, when a public
   path runs through their field and persons begin to wander too much into
   the grass or corn, will put up bushes to keep the public to the path.
   Or just as ranchers, to keep their cattle in their fields, make thick
   thorn hedges which the beasts cannot break through, so God puts a thorn
   hedge of troubles right in the way of His chosen to stop them in their
   sins.

   This hedge may be placed in your way in different shapes--perhaps you
   will meet with it this day. I see the hand of God as it touches the
   elect but erring man! Suddenly business grows slack--customers fall off
   one by one--bad debts multiply. Bankruptcy stares him in the face.
   Where he had enough to lavish on his pleasures he now has not enough to
   supply his needs. A mighty famine has arisen in the land of sin and he
   begins to be in need. He little expected this. If anybody had told him
   when he was so proudly driving that fast-trotting horse along the
   streets that he would come to hard work, he would have laughed him to
   scorn!

   He thought he should live like a millionaire, but now he seems far more
   likely to die a pauper. Or it may be that sudden sickness has fallen
   upon his once strong and healthy person. He could drink with the most
   drunken and no voice could ring so loud as his in the midnight revelry.
   But now he is paralyzed--he has lost the use of half his limbs! Or
   perhaps some internal complaint has weakened him and made him totter
   along the road in constant jeopardy of sudden death. Now the smooth
   road is rough, indeed, and the world has lost its many charms.

   Ah, Sinner, the sound of music is hushed for you and the joys of the
   flowing bowl are yours no more. Your foaming tankards, your wantonness
   and chambering are gone--Mercy has torn them from you in love to your
   soul! Possibly the hedge is made of other thorns--perhaps the man's
   children sickened. There are many funerals in the house in quick
   succession. That first-born son, the expected heir, the joy of his
   father's heart falls like a withered flower. His wife is cut off as a
   lily snapped from its stalk and he stands weeping--a widowed husband--a
   childless man. Any of these ways, and thousands more which I need not
   here recount, are God's methods of building walls across the way of
   those whom He ordains to bless.

   When the man breaks through one hedge, the Lord of Mercy will build
   another and maintains His hedges at such a degree of strength that the
   bullock which is most accustomed to the yoke shall not be able to push
   through. O Backslider, the Divine finger can touch you in the most
   tender part and though up to this moment you have boasted, "Nobody can
   make me wretched! Nothing shall ever make me fret," yet He can shut you
   up in such despair that none can remove the heavy bar! Think of what
   your brain may yet become--it is cool and calculating now and you can
   clearly see that your fellows are left behind in the race of
   competition--but remember how soon an unseen cause may soften that
   brain into imbecility, or excite it into incipient insanity! How soon
   may that boasted brain become like a burning sea throbbing with waves
   of fire!

   Beware lest such a visitation become the prelude of the wrath eternal!
   My prayer for you is that more gentle means may bring you to
   repentance. But to that you will never come unless the Lord hedges up
   your way with thorns. Observe that it was a very disappointing
   impediment. While the prosperous sinner was securely pursuing his way
   he was stopped. "Why," says the man, "if it had not been for that, I
   should have made a fortune. Why did death come just when my fair girl
   looked so lovely in the bloom of opening womanhood and when my dear boy
   had grown so engaging that his company was my delight? Ah, this is
   trouble, indeed! To meet with misfortune just when I had built that new
   house and held my head so high, and expected to see my daughters so
   respectably married--why, this is very disappointing."

   And the man kicks. And though once he professed to be a child of God,
   yet it is painfully possible that he is ready to curse God and die. But
   if he knew--oh, if he knew the Divine motive--he would thank God for
   his troubles on bended knees! You remember that story of the painter in
   St. Paul's when on high he painted his picture upon the ceiling? As he
   went backward upon the stage to look at it and was so engrossed with
   his occupation he was just on the edge of the stage and in great danger
   of being dashed to pieces by a fall from that dizzy height. A friend
   saw him and knowing that if he called out to him he would be startled
   and thus his fall might be hastened, he took up a brush full of paint
   and threw it at the picture. The desired effect was produced, for the
   painter in great anger rushed forward to upbraid him and thus his life
   was spared!

   God seeing you painting a fair scene of life and happiness on earth
   suddenly spoils it all--you rush forward, crying out against Him. But
   oh, what reason have you to thank Him for that disappointment which has
   robbed Satan of his prey and saved your soul! Moreover, what painful
   hindrances our heavenly Father often uses. He hedges the sinner's path
   not with rhododendrons and azaleas, not with roses and laurels, but
   with thorns. Prickly thorns which curse the soil and tear the flesh are
   God's instrument of restraint. Nothing but a thorn hedge would have
   stopped the man--he was so madly set upon his present course that he
   would dash through anything else.

   But God, whose eternal mercy has marked that man out as a special
   object of love, uses the most effectual remedies and plants a fence of
   thorns. Are you smarting this morning--so smarting that you wish you
   had never been born? Do you feel so much the cuts and lashes of evil
   fortune that you would sooner end your existence than continue any
   longer as you are? I bless God for this, if you are one of His
   children, for it is this and this only, that will change your ways!

   Furthermore, the fence is effectual if the thorn hedge will not
   suffice--it is written, "I will make a wall." There are some so
   desperate in sin that they will break through ordinary restraints. Then
   a wall shall be tried through which there is no breaking, over which
   there is no climbing. Ah, Backslider! Backslider! Perhaps you have
   already broken through the thorn hedge--your trials have not been
   sanctified. I have known some who have had enough trials, one would
   think, to have melted a heart of adamant and yet they have set their
   faces like a flint against God and gone on worse than ever. "Who is
   Jehovah, that I should obey Him?" said Pharaoh, when he was vexed with
   many plagues. And so have you said!

   God, I trust, will not destroy you as He did Pharaoh, but He will
   break, one way or another, the iron sinew of your proud neck. For when
   it comes to a wrestle between God and you, you may be sure of a fall!
   The Lord never was defeated, even by the stoutest adversary and He will
   not, in your case, be frustrated in His design. If you are really one
   of His chosen, you shall meet with an affliction such as perhaps you
   never heard of in any other man. And if nothing but this will stop you,
   He will invent some new form of disease, some fresh method of pain in
   order to get at your soul. If you cannot be saved by the gentle wind,
   He will send the storm.

   If this suffices not, He will try the hurricane and if you will not run
   into port even then, tornado shall follow tornado till you are broken
   to pieces like a wreck and compelled to swim to the Rock of Ages for
   rescue. These are but parts of His ways and even His hard things are
   full of mercy. The tender mercies of the wicked are cruel, but the
   cruel things of God are full of tender mercy! He only uses these
   methods because nothing else will do and He would sooner that you
   should enter into Heaven with every bone broken, than that you should
   descend into Hell with the full use of your powers.

   III. In the third place, you would think that the sinner would now
   stop, but instead of it, according to the text,

   EVEN THOUGH GOD WALLS UP THE WAY OF SIN, MEN WILL TRY TO FOLLOW IT, BUT
   IN THE CHOSEN

   THIS RESOLVE WILL BE IN VAIN. "She shall follow after her lovers, but
   she shall not overtake them. And she shall seek them, but shall not
   find them." Do you see the man? He has suffered such loss that he
   cannot find the means to sin as he used to do! Where he had money to
   spend to indulge himself he now finds an empty purse but yet he tries
   to do his worst.

   He goes up and down that wall to see if there is not a hole in it
   somewhere. He tries to scramble over it where there is a projecting
   stone--he climbs half-way up, and falling, cuts his hands--but he will
   try again and again. He runs all along that thorn hedge and looks and
   looks again for a gap and oh, if he could find but one! If he could but
   escape from God's boundaries! If he could but scrape enough money
   together to have another debauch. If he could find just enough to play
   the gentleman again. But he cannot--he has no means whatever to indulge
   his sin.

   Perhaps the case runs another way--God has taken away from the man all
   the pleasure of sin. He cannot be so satisfied as he used to be with
   his money. As he puts it into the till he despises it--and when he sees
   it accumulating at his banker's it only brings him care and no content
   as once it did. His children turn out, one by one, a curse to him. In
   business everything seems determined to plague him. Whereas at the
   theater he could gaze and listen with ecstasy, the whole affair is now
   tame and dull. Those wines, so full of flavor, have now, through his
   satiety lost their usual charm. Let him do what he will, the world is
   all a blank and wretchedness for him!

   Like Tiberius he would give a mint of gold to anyone who would invent
   him a new pleasure or restore the vigor of the old. But no, the thorn
   hedge is too well made--the Great Farmer has planted it too well. The
   sinner would become a spiritual suicide but he cannot, let him desire
   it as he may. He is desperately set on destruction as though it were to
   be desired. O Sinner, how is this--how has the fall spoilt us that we
   should be so enamored of our own destruction? O my God, what a creature
   is man! Though he knows that sin will be his ruin, yet he hugs it as
   though it were his chief mercy! He heaps to himself destruction as
   though it were gold and digs for his own ruin as for hid treasure!

   Oh, if the righteous were half as intent in seeking after goodness as
   the wicked are in hunting after sin, how much more active would they
   be! If we were half as strongly set upon the things of God as sinners
   are set upon their own ways and their own pleasures, we should have no
   waverers, no timid, cowardly spirits! Truly this love of sin is so
   strange that if we did not see it in ourselves we should wonder at it!
   But Christian, this is in you as much as in the worst of men! You, too,
   if it had not been for Divine mercy, would have plunged on from bad to
   worse. If Omnipotence itself had not seized the reins and turned us
   into the way of Truth, we should at this moment have been dashing on in
   the road of sin!

   I say if Omnipotence itself had not interposed--it was not the
   minister, it was not conscience, it was not merely Providence. It was
   more than this--Jehovah's own right arm threw back the horse on its
   haunches and cast the rider to the ground as He did Saul at Damascus,
   or else we should have hastened on to our destruction and perished
   through the hardness of our hearts. Let us sing unto Him whose mighty
   mercy has rescued us and let us pity those whom the restraints of
   Providence cannot bind--those who will, if they can--leap through stone
   walls to have their way and their sin.

   Thus, dear Friends, we have presented to you the deplorable picture of
   the infatuated sinner, perfectly infatuated and drunken with the love
   of sin and enmity to God! And Mercy itself, so far as we have gone,
   foiled of its purpose. The thorn hedge not enough--the stone wall not
   enough. What shall come now?

   IV. Our next business is to consider THAT THE BACKSLIDER'S FAILURE IS
   FOLLOWED BY A BLESSED RESULT. The hunt was very arduous but the greedy
   hunter has missed his prey and there he sits weary with the chase and
   ashamed of himself. What comes of it? Do observe it, for the result is
   one which I hope you and I know already. "Then shall she say, I will go
   and return to my first husband; for then it was better with me than
   now." O Lord, teach some who are here this morning to pray this prayer!

   Observe here is repentance attended with sorrow. The poor creature in
   this case feels, deeply feels to the very soul, the wretchedness of her
   condition. She is in so bad a plight that though she had despised her
   former state she now confesses it to be better. Observe that it is an
   active repentance. It is not merely "I will return," but, "I will go
   and return." When the Grace of God sets a backslider upon returning, he
   will stir up all the powers of his soul to seek after God. He cries,
   "My soul waits for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning."
   I say more than they that watch for the morning.

   There is much earnestness in a sinner seeking Christ, but, if possible,
   there is more in a backslider returning from the error of his ways--for
   he has not only the guilt of sin to mourn over--but the double guilt of
   having despised the Sav- ior, of having known the way of righteousness
   and having turned from it. Here are two spurs to make him speed on in
   his course. Observe, dear Friends, that the confession which this poor
   soul makes of folly is one which is sustained by the best of reasons.
   She says, "Then was it better with me than now." Let us see whether
   this is not true with you.

   Well, Backslider, what have you gained by it, after all? Have you
   gained anything more comfortable than the light of your Father's face.
   You once could say, "Abba, Father!" You rejoiced to know that God was
   at peace with you. You were reconciled to Him by the death of His Son.
   Now God is angry with you! Your fears tell you that He has forgotten to
   be gracious. What can make up for this loss? When God lights a candle,
   what brightness is in the room! But when God's candle is gone, where is
   the sun and where the moon? They give no light to you.

   Before, when you were in your right senses, you had the privilege of
   going to the Throne of Grace. You could tell your needs before God and
   spread your sorrows there. But you have no Throne of Grace to go to
   now. Why, you scarcely dare pray! As for your friends, you would not
   like to tell them your troubles. Poor Prodigal, what sorry friends are
   those who waited on you in your days of wealth! They sat with their
   legs under your mahogany and drank your wine while you had any--but you
   know that you would be a fool to expect any help from them now that you
   need it.

   Your lovers have forsaken you and those who once were so kind--where is
   their love now? Do I see one among you who has been cast off by her
   companion in sin and shame! Ah, Woman! Poor wretched Woman! Have you
   been made to feel that smart so common to those who sin as you have
   done--cast into the street by him who first decoyed you by his fair
   promises of love? Your case is but one of many and there are thousands
   who find that the world knows not what faithfulness means.

   First sin deludes, deceives, and pretends to love and then afterwards
   it casts off its victims. Ah, you had a father's house to go to and a
   father's mercy to plead. But you do not have it now--it was better with
   you then than now. And then, you had God's promises to fall back upon.
   If you had any trouble, you opened your Bible and there was a passage
   to cheer you. When you had losses, the cheering words exactly met your
   case. But now that Book is full of fire--it flashes lightning upon you
   as you read it--there is not a promise there which smiles on you!

   Your fears whisper that the treasury of God is shut against you. Once
   you had communion with Christ Jesus--ah, now I touch a tender
   string--you did sit at the banqueting table of Christ! Unless you were
   awfully deceived and a gross hypocrite, you could say, "He has kissed
   me with the kisses of His mouth." After this, how could you go to the
   door of that deceiver Madame Wanton! How is this? O Soul, if you have
   ever known the love of Christ I am sure you will say, "It was better
   with me then than now."

   What can the world afford you comparable to fellowship with Jesus? One
   hour upon His bosom is worth ten thousand years in the palaces and
   courts of the world's wealth and royalty and you know that it is so.
   There is no room to entertain a comparison for a moment--

   "What peaceful hours you once enjoyed, How sweet their memory still But
   they have left an aching void The world can never fill."

   O that your repentance, fixed upon such reasons as these, may be deep!
   May you make a confession of your extreme folly and now fall down
   before God and find mercy!

   To close this point, this repentance was acceptable. It is not often
   that a husband is willing to take back his wife when she has so grossly
   sinned, as the metaphor here implies. And yet observe that God is
   willing to receive the sinner, though his sin is even more aggravated.
   By the mouth of Jeremiah He speaks these words--"Return unto Me, for I
   am married unto you." I do not know anything which should make the
   backslider's heart break like the doctrine of God's immutable love to
   His people! Some say that if we preach that "whom once He loves He
   never leaves, but loves them to the end," it will be an inducement to
   man to sin.

   Well I know man is very vile and he can turn even love itself into a
   reason for sinning, but where there is as much as even one spark of
   Grace, a man cannot do that. A child does not say, "I will offend my
   father because he loves me." It is not even in fallen human nature,
   generally, unless inspired by the devil, to find motives for sin in
   God's love and certainly no backsliding child of God can say, "I will
   continue in sin that Grace may abound." They who do so show that they
   are reprobates and their damnation is just.

   But the backslider who is a child of God at the bottom, will, I think,
   feel no cord so strong to hold him back from sin as this. Backslider, I
   hope it will also be a golden chain to draw you to Christ. Jesus meets
   you, meets you this morning. You were excommunicated. You were driven
   out from among God's people with shame but Jesus meets you, and
   pointing to the wounds which He received in the house of His friends at
   your hands, He nevertheless says, "Return unto Me, for I am married
   unto you." It is a relationship which you have broken and it might
   legally be broken forever if He willed it--but He does not will it--for
   He hates divorce.

   You are married to Jesus. Come back to your first Husband, for He is
   your Husband still! The Fountain which washed you once can wash you
   again. "Though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be as white as
   snow. Though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool." The
   robe of righteousness which covered you once can cover you again!
   Though you have cast it from you with scorn, yet it is yours and the
   Father bids His servants bring forth the best robe and put it on you.
   He says, "Come to Me!" You have forgotten the Lord, but He has not
   forgotten youl You love sin, but He will change your will and set your
   heart upon Himself, for He is determined that you shall be His forever!

   Is not this a soul-melting doctrine? If there is so much as a spark of
   spiritual life in you, I think you will say, "Against such love as this
   I cannot sin! Against such tender mercy I will not rebel--I will return
   unto my first husband, for then it was better with me than now." I do
   not know, but I may be speaking very pointedly and personally to some
   here--I hope I am. I know that the most of you are not in this
   condition and for this I thank my God. I pray you, however, lift up
   your hearts in prayer for those who are and ask my Master that as this
   bow is drawn at a venture He may direct the arrow.

   There are some such here--I know there are. There are some here who
   have come this very morning with no idea that God would meet with them.
   You have put the reins upon your neck and you have given yourselves up.
   The restraints of morality can scarcely bind you and yet once you
   prayed at the Prayer Meeting and sat at the sacramental table and you
   put on the Lord Jesus Christ by profession in Baptism. But oh, what are
   you now? Your life would not bear to be talked of. Your conduct has
   become so gross and vile you might have expected to have heard this
   morning some word that should have cut you off forever from hope! But,
   by God's Grace, instead of it the silver trumpet sounds today with
   notes of love and pity. Return! Return !--Your Husband woos you over
   again--return! For then it was better with you than now.

   V. Not to be longer on the point, let us observe in the fifth place
   that THERE IS AN AWFUL CONTRAST TO ALL THIS. There are some who prosper
   in this world until, like a wide-spread tree, they are cut down and
   cast into the fire. There are backsliders, who, never having had the
   root of the matter in them, go back unto their own ways to the land
   from which they came out and continue there forever. I beseech you
   never trifle with backsliding. I have put God's Free Grace in the
   boldest manner that I could just now, but oh, let me warn any man who
   would pervert that Free Grace into an excuse for sin!

   Let me warn him against playing with backsliding! One man may roll down
   a precipice and may scarcely be injured, but I would not try it, for I
   might break my neck. One man took poison and he was hurried off to the
   hospital and by the use of proper antidotes was spared, but I would not
   advise you to try it--no I would beg you to put it away from you.
   Chosen vessels of mercy, notwithstanding their backslidings, are
   brought back. But ah, remember that nine out of ten of those who
   backslide never were God's people! They go out from us because they
   were not of us and this is the history of their lives and may be the
   history of your life--ah, and may be the history of mine yet!

   They joined the Church. They had been greatly impressed under a sermon.
   They were young, they knew little as yet of the trials of life--being
   in the Church they walked consistently for years. They kept the faith.
   But the Church was cold and they grew cold, too. They neglected weekday
   services. The closet was forsaken. Family prayer was hardly attended
   to. Then they forsook the sanctuary altogether, but they were still
   moral and upright. They began soon to associate with those whom once
   they avoided--their business went on well.

   They had risen from the lowest grade of society to occupy a middle
   position. They still prospered--gold accumulated. They were the
   successful people. There was a worm at the root of it all, it is true,
   but nevertheless it looked so fair and seemed so well. The man did not
   like to remember that he ever had gone to that little Meeting House--he
   felt ashamed that ever he had associated with those whom once he knew
   to be the people of God. He went on still accumulating wealth, but one
   day he was found dead! Shall I pursue his history? In Hell he lifts up
   his eyes in torments forever!

   With this as the special worm that never could die to gnaw his
   conscience--that he did know in his head the way of right-eousness--but
   had turned away from it in his heart!

   In letters of fire he sees written across that burning sky: "YOU KNEW
   YOUR DUTY BUT YOU DID IT NOT. You have come from the cup of the Lord to
   the cup of devils--you turned aside from the people of God to the
   children of Satan! You deliberately chose the evil and you forsook the
   good--you perished not as the ignorant perish, not as they perished who
   were careless from their birth--not as those who were unvisited by
   pangs of conscience, or who knew not the Word! You perished in the
   light of the Gospel, with the sun of mercy shining upon your eyeballs!
   You perished, though you stood, as it were, on the very doorstep of
   Heaven! You drifted back to Hell in the teeth of a tide of mercy."

   "This, I say, may be your case and mine, if we are not really rooted
   and grounded in Christ--we may fall by little and little. We may even
   continue till we die to be Church members and yet backslide in heart by
   slow degrees until we become rotten through and through and God casts
   us on the dunghill. I say by the special and miraculous mercy of God
   His elect will be ingathered, but take heed, Sirs, that you build not
   on your profession, for profession is no proof of election. You must be
   born again and only the man who continues to the end shall be saved.
   May we have such perseverance given us, for His name's sake.

   VI. With this last we conclude--IS NOT THIS SUBJECT A VERY SOLEMN
   WARNING TO THE PEOPLE OF

   GOD? What some do others may do. If one man falls, another may. If one
   professor turned out to be a hypocrite, so may another. If one minister
   reels from the pinnacle of honor and is dashed upon the rocks beneath,
   so may another. I want to make a personal application of this to myself
   and I pray my Brothers in office behind me, venerable though some of
   them are in years, to remember that this may be their case.

   And you, my associates and fellow members, many of you united to the
   Church before I was born, remember that age and habit are no security
   against apostasy! There must be the continual keeping and anointing of
   the Holy Spirit. I beseech you, and here I do beseech myself also, let
   us watch against the beginnings of backsliding. Let us take care of the
   little sins. O let us watch against the little coolnesses of heart.
   Brethren, no man backslides all at once. Few men who profess to be
   saints become outward sinners in one step. It is usually by little and
   by little. I pray you do not forsake the assembling of yourselves
   together!

   Wake up from your coldness in private prayer if this has come over you.
   If your love to Christ has grown cold stay not in this state of danger
   but pray to the Master to inflame your heart again! If any of you have
   in any respect whatever fallen from your first love--if that old
   enthusiasm which was in us as a Church has departed from any of
   you--pray God to give it back to you. If any of you are not bringing
   forth such fruit unto God as you used to do, O be suspicious of
   yourselves! Carnal security may be the Heaven of fools, but it is the
   ruin of Believers--

   "Be watchful, be vigilant, dangers may be, In an hour when all seems
   secure to you"

   Especially at this time when the eyes of the world are fixed upon you
   as a Church and upon me as a witness for God, let us walk carefully. If
   ever I might ask your prayers, no, claim them as my right, it is now! I
   beseech you who love God, ask for me my Lord's upholding Grace that His
   servant may not flinch nor turn his back in the day of battle. Ask for
   yourselves the same, that when the fight shall grow less hot and there
   shall come an hour of calm and quiet thought, I, your pastor and
   yourselves, my fellow soldiers in Christ, may look down the ranks and
   say, "Not one comrade has fallen. The arrows flew thick about them but
   their armor was complete! The enemy was fierce, but the Master gave
   them strength equal to their day. He has kept those whom He gave to us
   and not one of them is lost."

   May it be yours and mine on Heaven's starry steeps to look back upon
   the superlatively glorious Grace which shall have kept us to the end
   and brought us to the land where there shall be no more sin! Let us
   trust the Savior. There is the sinner's hope--there is the saint's
   strength! Let us cling to the Cross again and may Almighty Grace keep
   us there and so glorify itself forever. Amen.

"Thus Saith The Lord:" Or, The Book of Common Prayer Weighed in the Balances of
                                 the Sanctuary

   A Sermon

   (No. 591)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, Spetember 25th, 1864, by the

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "Thus saith the Lord."--Ezekiel 11:15.

   THE WISE MAN saith, "Where the word of a king is, there is power." What
   power must there be where there is the word of the King of kings, who
   ruleth over all! We are not left to conjecture as to the power of the
   divine word, for we know that "By the word of the Lord were the heavens
   made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth." Out of
   nothingness the glorious creation leaped at the bidding of the Most
   High, and when the earth was without form, and void, and darkness was
   upon the face of the deep, there was nothing wanted but that solemn
   voice, "Light be," and straightway light was. God's word was sufficient
   in itself to build the temple of the universe and to finish it from its
   foundations to its pinnacles. That same word upholdeth by its power,
   and ruleth all things by its might. The pillars of heaven stand because
   the divine word hath fixed them upon their bases, nor shall they be
   shaken until that same almighty word shall bid them remove; then as a
   moment's foam dissolves into the wave which bears it and is gone
   forever, so shall the whole creation melt away. His word, which
   created, shall also destroy; but until that word be spoken every atom
   of this world is imperishable. Consider, my brethren, what power is
   concentrated in him who is clothed with a vesture dipped in blood, and
   whose name is "THE WORD OF GOD." With what glorious power our Lord
   Jesus Christ uplifted the burden of our sins, carried the load up to
   the tree, and cast it forever into the Red Sea of his own atoning
   blood! Ye know how he burst the bars of death, tore away the gates of
   the grave, overthrew all the hosts of hell, and dragged the mightiest
   principalities of darkness as captives at his chariot wheels. At this
   day the government is upon his shoulders, and his name is the Mighty
   God, the Everlasting Father. Heaven and earth salute him as the
   Omnipotent Word. He sustains the spiritual life of all his people by
   feeding them upon himself; and he shall in due time perfect his saints,
   and present them without spot before his Father's throne. We ought,
   therefore, to bow with reverence to that which is truly the word of
   God, since it contains within itself the highest degree of power, and
   is ever the way in which divine omnipotence manifests itself.

   It is in the word that we must find wisdom and power, "because the
   foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is
   stronger than men." The faintest whisper of Jehovah's voice should fill
   us with a solemn awe, and command the deepest obedience of our souls.
   Brethren, how careful should we be that we do not set up in God's
   temple anything in opposition to his word, that we do not permit the
   teachings of a creature to usurp the honor due to the Lord alone! "Thus
   saith antiquity," "thus saith authority," "thus saith learning," "thus
   saith experience,"--these be but idol-gods, which defile the temple of
   God; be it yours and mine, as bold iconoclasts, to dash them in pieces
   without mercy, seeing that they usurp the place of the word of God.

   "Thus saith the Lord "--this is the motto of our standard, the war-cry
   of our spiritual conflict,--the sword with which we hope yet to smite
   through the loins of the mighty who rise up against God's truth.
   Nothing shall stand before this weapon in the day when God cometh out
   of his hiding-place; for even at this hour, when "Thus saith the Lord"
   sounds from the trumpet of the Lord's ministers, the hosts of Midian
   begin to tremble; for well they know the might of that terrible
   watchword in days of yore.

   This morning, I shall first endeavor to show, briefly, the value of a
   "Thus saith the Lord;" and then, secondly, I shall, with as much
   calmness of spirit as I can command, request a "Thus faith the Lord"
   for certain things which are received and practiced in the State
   Establishment of our land, and close with a word of personal
   application, beseeching you to seek a "Thus saith the Lord" for any
   hopes which you may entertain of being partakers of the inheritance of
   the saints in light.

   I. LET US CONSIDER THE VALUE OF A "THUS SAITH THE LORD."

   1. Our first observation is that it is the minister's message. If he be
   God's minister, he does not found his teaching upon his own authority,
   for then his message would be only that of himself, and not to be
   esteemed; but he shows the authority of his Master, and none can
   gainsay him. He claims men's attention on the ground that he utters a
   "Thus saith the Lord." No matter how aged he may be, he does not
   proclaim the truth as merely the result of his long investigations or
   his extraordinary experience, but he grounds it upon "Thus saith the
   Lord." So spake the hoary-headed Joshua when for many a year he had
   known the faithfulness of God, and was about to die. He was singing his
   swan-song, preaching his last sermon; but he did not commence it, "Thus
   saith my age," "Thus say I upon mine own authority," but "Thus saith
   the Lord God of Israel." A God-sent minister is the ambassador of the
   Most High, but he has no right to go beyond his commission; and when he
   does so, his office cannot yield him support. The prophets of God did
   not say, "Thus I speak as a prophet," but, "Thus saith the Lord." When
   the prophet came in Gideon's days and spoke to erring Israel, he opened
   his mouth with, "Thus saith the Lord God of Israel." Turn to the pages
   of Isaiah, and mark how frequent he quotes the divine authority; study
   the plaintive words of Jeremiah, and observe how solemnly his prophetic
   woes are prefaced with, "Thus saith the Lord;" and the soaring Ezekiel,
   to whom was given, as it were, six wings, that he might take more lofty
   flights than the eagle knoweth--even he relied not upon the sublimity
   of his language or the glory of his imagery, but found the sinews of
   his strength in "Thus saith the Lord God." This is the trowel and this
   the hammer of God's builders,--this the trumpet of his watchmen and the
   sword of his warriors. Woe to the man who comes in any other name! If
   we, or an angel from heaven, shall preach unto you anything but a "Thus
   saith the Lord," no matter what our character or standing, give no heed
   to us, but cleave unto the truth as it is in Jesus. To the law and to
   the testimony, if we speak not according to this word, it is because
   there is no light in us. That test which we demand to be exercised upon
   others we cheerfully consent to be exercised upon ourselves, praying
   that we may have grace to forsake our errors as we would have other men
   forsake theirs.

   2. "Thus saith the Lord" is the only authority in God church. When the
   tabernacle was pitched in the wilderness, what was the authority for
   its length and breadth? Why was the altar of incense to be placed here,
   and the brazen laver there? Why so many lambs or bullocks to be offered
   on a certain day? Why must the Passover be roasted whole and not
   sodden? Simply and only because God had shown all these things to Moses
   in the holy mount; and thus had Jehovah spoken, "Look that thou make
   them after their pattern, which was showed thee in the mount." It is
   even so in the church at the present day; true servants of God demand
   to see for all church ordinances and doctrines the express authority of
   the church's only Teacher and Lord. They remember that the Lord Jesus
   bade the apostles to teach believers to observe all things whatsoever
   he had commanded them; but he neither gave to them nor to any man power
   to alter his own commands. The Holy Ghost revealed much of precious
   truth and holy precept by the apostles, and to his teaching we would
   give earnest heed; but when men cite the authority of fathers and
   councils and bishops, we give place for subjection? no, not for an
   hour. They may quote Irenaeus or Cyprian, Augustine or Chrysostom; they
   may remind us of the dogmas of Luther or Calvin; they may find
   authority in Simeon, Wesley, or Gill--we will listen to the opinions of
   those great men with the respect which they deserve as men; but having
   so done, we deny that we have anything to do with these men as
   authorities in the church of God: for there nothing has any authority
   but "Thus saith the Lord of Hosts." Yea, if you shall bring us the
   concurrent consent of all tradition--if you shall quote precedents
   venerable with fifteen, sixteen, or seventeen centuries of
   antiquity--we burn the whole as so much worthless lumber, unless you
   put your finger upon the passage of Holy Writ which warrants the matter
   to be of God. You may further plead, in addition to all this venerable
   authority, the beauty of the ceremony, and its usefulness to those who
   partake therein, but this is all foreign to the point; for to the true
   church of God the only question is this: Is there a "Thus saith the
   Lord" for it? And if divine authority be not forthcoming, faithful men
   thrust forth the intruder as the cunning craftiness of men.

   3. "Thus saith the Lord" is the most fitting word of rebuke for erring
   saints. God's people when they err, if they be rebuked, even though it
   should be in the gentlest manner, are too apt to resent the rebuff; but
   when we can come to them with "Thus saith the Lord," if there be a
   spark of spiritual life left, it is sure to catch at this flame. When
   the man of God came to Eli, how Eli's heart trembled when he began,
   "Thus saith the Lord," and described to him the doom of his house,
   because his sons had made themselves vile, and he had not restrained
   them. David the king might have been moved to anger against Nathan for
   that personal parable and pungent application; but his anger was
   stayed, nay, better still, his heart was broken, because the prophet
   could say, "Thus saith the Lord." My dear brethren in Christ, you and I
   have often risen in anger at the intrusive proofs of ignorant men; but
   I hope we have far more often felt the melting power of a "Thus saith
   the Lord." When the heart is right, the word of God sweetly melts us,
   as the breath of the south wind melts the frozen rivers.

   4. "Thus saith the Lord" is the only solid ground of comfort to God's
   people. Where can a child of God find true solace apart from that which
   cometh out of the mouth of the Most High! Truly, "Man doth not live by
   bread alone; but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God
   doth man live;" "Thy words were found, and I did eat them;" "How sweet
   are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!" When
   Nathan came to tell David of the covenant which the Lord would make
   with him and his house, David would scarcely have believed so great a
   mercy to be really his if the prophet had not began with "Thus saith
   the Lord." It was not "Thus saith Nathan," or "Thus do the ancients
   say," but "Thus saith the Lord;" and David's heart was full of holy joy
   when he saw the covenant to be ordered in all things and sure. When
   Hezekiah lay sick unto death, he turned his face to the wall and
   prayed; but there was no comfort to the royal suppliant until the
   prophet came with "Thus saith the Lord;" and when Sennacherib was about
   to besiege Jerusalem, and Lachish had fallen, Hezekiah prayed, and the
   people with him; but oh! they could not think it possible that there
   should be a hook put into the jaw of the mighty Assyrian, and that he
   should be turned back by the way in which he came, till the prophet
   reassured their hearts with a "Thus saith the Lord." Zion's sons and
   daughters feast upon the sure word of their faithful God. Brethren, I
   need not enlarge here, for I hope most of you know the preciousness of
   a divine promise. There is nothing wanted to stay your soul in your
   worst troubles but the Word of God applied with power. God may not seed
   you a friend; he may not raise up a deliverer; but if he shall only
   give you to believe his Word, that shall be enough for you. Martin
   Luther said: "I have covenanted with my Lord that he should not send me
   visions, or dreams, or even angels. I am content with this one gift of
   the Scriptures, which abundantly teaches and supplies all that is
   necessary, both for this life and that which is to come." O Lord, only
   feed me on thy Word, and I will not envy kings their delicacies, nor
   even the angels around thy throne the bread of heaven on which they
   live.

   5. Yet again: "Thus saith the Lord" is that with which we must confront
   the Lords enemies. When Moses went in before Pharaoh, the words which
   he used were not, "The elders of Israel have consulted, and thus have
   they bidden me say," not "Our Father Abraham once said, and his words
   have been handed to us by long tradition "--such talk would have been
   readily resisted; but he confronted the haughty monarch with "Thus
   saith the Lord, Let my people go;" and it was the power of this divine
   word which rained plagues upon the fields of Zoan, and brought forth
   the captives, with silver and gold. Pharaoh might boast, "Who is the
   Lord, that I should obey his voice?" but ere long he knew that
   Jehovah's word was mightier than all the horsemen and chariots of
   Mizraim, and was not to be resisted without terrible defeat. To this
   day, if we would break sinners' hearts, our hammer must be "Thus saith
   the Lord;" and if we would woo them to obedience to King Jesus, our
   reasons must come from his own Word. I have often noticed in
   conversion, that, though sometimes a particular passage of the sermon
   may be quoted by the converted person as the means of enlightenment,
   yet in the majority of cases it is the text, or some passage of
   Scripture, quoted during the sermon, which is blessed to do the work.
   McCheyne says, "Depend upon it, it is God's Word, not our comment upon
   God's Word, that saves souls;" and so it is. Let us use much of
   Scripture, much of the pure silver of sacred revelation, and no human
   alloy. "What is the chaff to the wheat, saith the Lord?"

   6. To close this point. Such an authority has a "Thus saith the Lord,"
   that it is not to be despised without entailing upon the offender the
   severest penalty. Samuel came to Saul with "Thus saith the Lord," and
   bade him destroy the Amalekites. He was utterly to cut them off, and
   not to spare so much as one of them. But Saul saved the best of the
   cattle and the sheep, and brought home Agag; and what was the result?
   His kingdom was taken from him and given to a neighbor of his that was
   better than he; and because he exalted himself beyond measure to do
   otherwise than according to the letter of God's command, he was put
   away forever from having dominion over Israel. And mark this word: if
   any church in Christendom shall continue, after light is given and
   after plain rebuke is uttered, to walk contrary to the word of God, and
   to teach that which is inconsistent with Holy Scripture, as Saul was
   put away from the kingdom, so shall that church be put away from before
   the Lord of Hosts; and if any man, be he who he may, after receiving
   light from on high, continues willfully to shut his eyes, he shall not,
   if an heir of heaven, be rejected from eternal salvation, but he shall
   be cast off from much of the usefulness and comfort which he might
   otherwise have enjoyed. He knew his Master's will, and did it not: he
   shall be beaten with many stripes. He has been as the horse or the mule
   which have no understanding, and his mouth shall be held in with bit
   and bridle. Many sorrows shall be to those who dare to dash themselves
   against the thick bosses of Jehovah's buckler by opposing his "Thus
   saith the Lord." Upon whomsoever this stone shall fall, it shall grind
   him to powder; and whosoever shall fall upon it shall be broken, to his
   own lasting damage. O my brethren! I would that we trembled and stood
   more in awe of God's word. I fear me that many treat the things of God
   as though they were merely matters of opinion, but remember that
   opinion cannot govern in God's house. God's word, not man's opinion,
   claims your allegiance. Remember that although our ignorant conscience
   may not accuse us of error, yet if we walk contrary to God's word, our
   conscientiousness does not screen us from sin; for conscience is not
   the sovereign arbiter of right and wrong, but the plain word of God is
   the rule of equity. I do not sin so foully as if I sinned against my
   conscience, but I still sin, if, having an unenlightened conscience, I
   ignorantly transgress. But if I wilfully keep my conscience in
   darkness, and continue in errors which I might easily know to be such
   by a little thought and searching of God's word, then my conscience can
   offer me no excuse, for I am guilty of blindfolding the guide which I
   have chosen, and then, knowing him to be blindfolded, I am guilty of
   the folly of letting him lead me into rebellion against God. O church
   of God! hear thou the voice of thy great Founder and Lord: "Whosoever,
   therefore shall one of these least commandments, and shall teach men
   so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven." "He that
   hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he
   that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and
   will manifest myself to him." Oh for a stern integrity, that will hold
   the word, and will never depart from it, come what may. This much
   concerning the value of a "Thus saith the Lord."

   II. Dear friends, the second part of our subject may be very
   displeasing to some who have strayed in here, but that I cannot help. I
   do not remember ever asking any one to come and hear me, and therefore,
   as you come of your own wills, when I have any truth to speak, I shall
   not conceal it because you choose to be present. At the present crisis,
   I feel that it is woe unto me if I do not lift up my voice like a
   trumpet, and urge with all my might the necessity of reformation in our
   State Church. I have, moreover, an excellent excuse for the inquiry I
   am about to make; for as I am publicly charged with ignorance, it is at
   once my duty and my privilege to seek instruction of those who claim
   authority to teach. When one is known to be profoundly ignorant, and
   there are certain fathers in the faith who have the power to instruct,
   the least thing that can be allowed us is to ask questions, and the
   smallest boon we can expect is to have them answered by men expressly
   ordained to instruct the ignorant.

   The Rev. W. Goode, the Dean of Ripon, appears to be much better
   acquainted with the extent of my reading and mental acquirements than I
   am myself. He speaks with all the positiveness of a personal
   acquaintance concerning my reputed ignorance, and for my own part I am
   not at all anxious to question so very reverend an authority. He
   writes: "As to that young minister who is now raving against the
   Evangelical clergy on this point, it is to be regretted that so much
   notice has been taken of his railings. He is to be pitied, because his
   entire want of acquaintance with theological literature leaves him
   utterly unfit for the determination of such a question; which is a
   question, not of more doctrine, but of what may be called historical
   theology; and his charges are just a parallel to those which the
   Romanists would bring against himself as well as others for the
   interpretation of the words, This is my body.' But were he a wiser man
   than he is, he would know better what his qualifications are for
   passing Judgment on such a point, and be willing to learn from such
   facts, among others, as the Gorham Judgment and the cases of Mr.
   Maskell and Mr. Mozley, what ground there is for his charges against
   the Evangelical clergy. Let him hold and enforce his own view of
   doctrine as he pleases; but when he undertakes to determine what is the
   exclusive meaning of the Book of Common Prayer, and brings a charge of
   dishonesty against those who take a different view of that meaning from
   what he does, he only shows the presumptuous self-confidence with which
   he is prepared to pronounce judgment upon matters of which he is
   profoundly ignorant. To hold a controversy with him upon the subject
   would be to as little purpose as to attempt to hold a
   logically-constructed argument with a child unacquainted with logical
   terms."

   When this paragraph caught my eye, my heart leaped with joy, for I knew
   that the sinners in Zion were afraid; and I thought I heard a voice
   crying from the Word, "Not many wise men after the flesh, not many
   mighty, not many noble, are called; but God hath chosen the foolish
   things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak
   things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; and base
   things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen,
   yea, and things which are not, to bring to naught things that are: that
   no flesh should glory in his presence." My mind flew back to the valley
   of Elah, and I remembered the words of the old record: "And when the
   Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him; for he was
   but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance. And the Philistine
   said unto David, Am I a dog that thou comest to me with staves? And the
   Philistine cursed David by his gods. And the Philistine said to David,
   Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to
   the beasts of the field." My spirit kindled at these words of the
   boastful champion of yore, and at their modern reproduction by the
   vainglorious divine of Ripon, and the answer of David was in my heart
   as it is even now upon my tongue: "Thou comest to me with a sword and
   with a spear and with a shield; but I come to thee in the name of the
   Lord of Hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.
   This day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand that all the earth
   may know that there is a God in Israel. And all this assembly shall
   know that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear; for the battle is
   the Lord's, and he will give you into our hands." Admitting the witness
   of the venerable dean to be correct, and that "the young minister" is
   inexpert in logic, I am not therefore ashamed; far otherwise, I will
   the rather glory in mine infirmities that the power of Christ may rest
   upon me; "for when I am weak, then am I strong." Take, O ye great ones
   of the earth, every profit that can be made out of your belief in my
   utter total ignorance, and your own profound and extensive learning,
   and then go your ways, and learn what this meaneth: "Thy wisdom and thy
   knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou hast said in thine heart, I
   am, and none else beside me. Therefore shall evil come upon thee: thou
   shalt not know from whence it riseth.. And now at this hour, having
   been condemned as intolerably ignorant, I feel I have the liberty to
   ask just a few explanations of those reverend divines who do know or
   ought to know the grounds of their faith and practice.

   1. I open this little book,--the Prayer-Book, of whose occasional
   services the more I know the less I approve,--and I find in the
   Baptismal Service, that when little children are brought to be
   sprinkled, certain godfathers and godmothers promise for them that they
   shall renounce the devil and all his works, the vain pomp and glory of
   the world, with all covetous desires of the same, etc., and that they
   shall obediently keep all God's holy will and commandments, and walk in
   the same all the days of their life. To me it seems that they might as
   well promise that the infants should grow up with Roman noses, auburn
   hair, and blue eyes; for they are just as able to make them do the one
   as the other. I shall not however intrude my opinion further, but
   simply ask whether there is a "Thus saith the Lord" for any man's
   standing proxy for a babe, and making such promises in its name?--in
   other words, I ask for apostolical, prophetic, or any other form of
   scriptural precept, or precedent, for the use of proxies in baptism.
   True religion is a personal matter--is its first manifestation in
   regeneration to be connected with the impossible promises of others?
   Plain proof-texts are requested for godfathers and godmothers; and such
   important persons deserve to be defended by the clergy, if texts of
   Scripture can be discovered. As I cannot imagine where the texts will
   be found, I must pause till the learned shall produce them. Further, I
   find that these children enter into a covenant by proxy, of which we
   are assured that the promise our Lord Jesus will for his part most
   surely keep and perform; but the children are bound to do their
   part--that part being something more than the gigantic task of keeping
   all the commandments of God. Now I ask for a "Thus saith the Lord" for
   such a covenant as this. I find two covenants in the Word of God: one
   is the covenant of works, "This do, and thou shalt live;" I find
   another, the covenant of grace, which runs only in this wise, "I will
   be their God, and they shall be my people." I find it expressly
   declared that there cannot be a mixture of works and grace; for, says
   Paul, "If by grace, then it is no more of works: otherwise grace is no
   more grace; but if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise
   work is no more work;" and I ask a "Thus saith the Lord" for this
   baptismal covenant, which is nominally of grace, but really of works,
   or at best an unnatural conglomerate of grace and works. I ask those
   who have searched Scripture through, to find me the form or the command
   for any baptismal covenant whatever. It is idle to say that such a
   covenant was allowed among the early Christians; their witness is not
   earlier enough for us: we want a "Thus saith the Lord," and nothing but
   this will justify this pretended covenant.

   We then find that after this covenant has been made, and the water has
   been applied in a manner which we think needs also a "Thus saith the
   Lord" to justify it, it is publicly declared that the babe is
   regenerated,--"Seeing now, dearly beloved brethren that this child is
   regenerated and grafted into the body of Christ's church, let us give
   thanks unto Almighty God for these benefits, and with one accord make
   our prayers unto him, that this child may lead the rest of his life
   according to this beginning." And, again, "We yield thee hearty thanks,
   most merciful Father, that it hath pleased thee to regenerate this
   infant with thy Holy Spirit, to receive him for thine own child by
   adoption, and to incorporate him into thy holy church," etc. We are
   told we do not understand the meaning of "regeneration" as it is used
   in the services of the Anglican Church. The meaning of this passage is
   historical, hypothetical, ecclesiastical, and we know not what. The
   words "to be born again" did not formerly seem to us to be so very
   difficult to understand, nor do they appear so now as they stand in
   Scripture; for we find in them the one regeneration which has renewed
   us in the spirit of our mind, and we cannot consent to use those words
   in any other sense. Well, whether regeneration be or be not a very
   equivocal word, we simply ask, Is there a "Thus saith the Lord" for the
   assertion that a sprinkled infant is therefore regenerate in any sense
   in the world? Will any person find us a text of Scripture?--he shall
   have large rewards from clergymen with uneasy consciences! We put our
   inquiry again in plain terms, Will some one oblige us with a plain
   "Thus saith the Lord" proving that water baptism in any one instance
   makes an unconscious babe a member of Christ and a child of God, in any
   sense which any sane person chooses to attach to those words? Where is
   the passage--where? Echo answers "where?" But this subject you have
   been considering for some time, and are well convinced that the process
   of regenerating babies by occult influences conveyed by water is a
   pure--no, an impure--invention of priest-craft. There is therefore no
   necessity that I enlarge upon a point so well understood.

   2. I have a second question to ask. There is prescribed in the Book of
   Common Prayer a peculiar ceremony called confirmation. I do not
   remember to have read of that in Scripture. I would like to have a
   "Thus saith the Lord" for that rite. As I am ready to yield as far as
   possible, suppose we take it for granted that this ceremony is
   defensible from Holy Writ, I would like to know whether there is any
   "Thus saith the Lord" allowing a person called a bishop to give to the
   assembled youths an assurance of divine favor by laying his hands on
   their heads? The bishop having laid his hands on every head presented
   to him, whether it be gracious or graceless, talks thus in the Collect,
   "Almighty and everliving God, who makest us both to will and to do
   those things that be good and acceptable unto thy divine majesty, we
   make our humble supplications unto thee for these thy servants upon
   whom (after the example of thy holy apostles) we have now laid our
   hands, to certify them (by this sign) of thy favor and gracious
   goodness towards them." Does this mean that the bishop's hand certifies
   the person touched thereby of special divine favor? So it seems to
   teach, as far as I can see. We want, then, a "Thus saith the Lord,"
   authorizing this individual in lawn to exercise the office of an
   apostle! We then desire scriptural warrant permitting him to certify
   these kneeling youths of the enjoyment or possession of any particular
   divine favor by putting his hands on their heads. If this means the
   common goodness of God, the bishop's hands are not needed to certify
   them of that; but as he has already declared in prayer that they were
   regenerated by water and the Spirit, and had been forgiven all their
   sins, it is clear that special favor is intended; we inquire,
   therefore, for his authority for giving these young people a further
   certificate of special divine favor by the imposition of his hands. Why
   his hands? Who is he that he can certify these persons of God's favor
   more than any other man? Where is his scriptural warrant to confer by
   his hands a certificate of grace upon young people who in innumerable
   cases are thoughtless and unconverted, if not profane? We want a "Thus
   saith the Lord" for the whole thing, and then for each item in detail.
   Endless is the task thus proposed to the honest Churchman.

   3. Another matter needs a little clearing up; and, as this Book was set
   forth by learned divines and bishops, I would like a lucid explanation.
   The priest visits a sick man, sits down by his bed-side, reads certain
   prayers, bids the patient remember his baptism, questions him as to his
   creed, gives him good advice about forgiving his enemies and making his
   will, moves him to make a special confession of his sin if he feels his
   conscience troubled with any weighty matter, after which confession the
   Rubric says "the priest shall absolve him" (if he humbly and heartily
   desire it), after this sort. Here is the absolution, and I humbly and
   heartily desire a "Thus saith the Lord" for it: "Our Lord Jesus Christ,
   who hath left power to his church to absolve all sinners who truly
   repent and believe in him, of his great mercy forgive thee thine
   offences; and by his authority committed to me, I absolve thee from all
   thy sins, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
   Ghost." Sir Priest, I want you to give me a plain warrant from God's
   Word for your absolving my dying neighbor at this rate. Who are you
   that you should use such words? The season is solemn: it is the hour of
   death, and the matter is weighty, for it concerns the eternal interests
   of the dying man, and may--nay, will, if you be found to be acting
   presumptuously in this matter--involve your own soul in eternal ruin.
   Whence did you derive your right to forgive that sick man? Might he not
   raise his withered hands and return the compliment by absolving you?
   Are you quite sure as to the committal of divine authority to you? Then
   show me the deed of gift, and let it be clearly of divine origin. The
   apostles were empowered to do many things; but who are you? Do you
   claim to be their successors? Then work miracles similar to theirs;
   take up serpents, and drink deadly things without being harmed thereby;
   prove to us that you have seen the Lord, or even that cloven tongues of
   fire have sat upon each of you. You evangelical clergy, dare you claim
   to be successors of the apostles, and to have power to forgive sins?
   Your Puseyite brethren go the whole length of superstitious pretension;
   but you have too much light to be so superstitious; and yet you do what
   is quite as wicked,--you solemnly subscribe that this absolution is not
   contrary to the Word of God when you know it is? Gorham case, say you.
   I care nothing for your Gorham case: I want a "Thus saith the Lord"
   warranting you to swear to what you know to be false and dangerous. Mr.
   Mozley and Mr. Maskell may give you all the comfort which they can
   afford; but one word of Peter or of Paul would be of more weight in
   this matter than a thousand words from either of them.

   You are aware, perhaps, that it is not every man who is permitted by
   the Established religion to pronounce this absolution. A person called
   a "deacon" is, I am informed, allowed to preach and do a great many
   things, but when he reads the Book of Common Prayer in the daily
   service he must not grant absolution; there is a supernatural something
   which the man has not yet received, for he has only once felt the
   episcopal imposition of hands. We shall see, by-and-by, where absolving
   power comes from. The deacon has attained to one grade of priestcraft,
   but the full vigor of mystic influence rests not upon him. Another
   touch, another subscription, and the keys of St. Peter will swing at
   his girdle; but his time is not yet. I ask him, whether he calls
   himself a deacon or a priest, where he gets a "Thus saith the Lord" for
   this absolution? which, if it be not of God, is a piece of
   impertinence, superstition, blasphemy, and falsehood.

   4. I turn on and find that when the sick dies he is buried in
   consecrated ground; and though he may have cut his throat while under
   delirium tremens, if the jury do not return a verdict of suicide, the
   priest shall say, as he casts earth upon the body, "Forasmuch as it
   hath pleased Almighty God of his great mercy to take unto himself the
   soul of our dear brother here departed, we therefore commit his body to
   the ground,--earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust,--in sure and
   certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life." And again, "We give
   thee hearty thanks for that it hath pleased thee to deliver this our
   brother out of the miseries of this sinful world." And yet again, "We
   meekly beseech thee, O Father, to raise us from he death of sin unto
   the life of righteousness; that when we shall depart this life, we may
   rest in him, as our hope is this our brother doth." We beg a "Thus
   saith the Lord" for burying every baptized thief, harlot, rogue,
   drunkard, and liar who may die in the parish--"in sure and certain hope
   of the blessed resurrection." "Oh! it is commanded by authority." What
   authority? We challenge it, and permit none to pass muster but a "Thus
   saith the Lord." Until clergymen will bring us scriptural warrant for
   uttering falsehoods over a grave, we dare not cease our testimony
   against them. How long will the many godly laymen in that Church remain
   quiet? Why do they not bestir themselves, and demand revision or
   disruption?

   5. Turning a little further on, into a part of the Prayer-Book not much
   frequented by ordinary readers, we come to the "Ordering of Priests,"
   or the way in which priests are made. Why priests? Is one believer more
   a priest than another, when all are styled a royal priesthood? Let that
   pass. Of course, brethren, the priests are made by the bishops, as the
   bishops are made by Lord Palmerston, or Lord Derby, or any other
   political leader who may be in office. The Prime Minister of England is
   the true fountain from whom all bishops flow, and the priests are minor
   emanations branching off from the mitre rather than the crown. Here is
   the way of ordering priests. Let heaven and earth hear this and be
   astonished: "When this prayer is done, the bishop with the priests
   present shall lay their hands severally upon the head of every one that
   receiveth the order of priesthood; the receivers humbly kneeling upon
   their knees, and the bishop saying, Receive the Holy Ghost.'" Listen to
   it, now! Think you behold the scene: a man of God, a bishop whom you
   have been in the habit of considering a most gracious, godly man, and
   such no doubt he may be, in a sort,--think you see him putting his
   hands upon the head of some evangelical man whom you will go and hear,
   or, if you like, upon some young rake fresh from Oxford,--and think you
   hear him say, "Receive the Holy Ghost for the office and work of a
   priest in the church of God, now committed unto thee by the imposition
   of our hands. Whose sins thou dost forgive, they are forgiven, and
   whose sins thou dost retain, they are retained." We want a "Thus saith
   the Lord" for that; for that is putting it rather strongly in the
   popish line, one would think. Is the way of ordering priests in the
   Church of Rome much worse than this? That the apostles did confer the
   Holy Ghost, we never thought of denying; but that Oxford, Exeter, or
   any other occupants of the bench can give the Holy Spirit, needs some
   proof other than their silk aprons or lawn sleeves can afford us. We
   ask, moreover, for one instance in which an apostle conferred upon any
   minister the power to forgive sins, and where it can be found in
   Scripture that any man other than an apostle ever received authority to
   absolve sinners. Sirs, let us say the truth; however much yonder priest
   may pretend at his parishioner's bedside to forgive sin, the man's sins
   are not forgiven; and the troubled conscience of the sinner often bears
   witness to the fact, as the day of judgment and the fearful hell of
   sinners must also bear witness. And what think you, sirs, must be the
   curse that fills the mouth of damned souls, when in another world they
   meet the priest who absolved them with this sham absolution! With what
   reproaches will such deceived ones meet the priest who sent them down
   to perdition with a lie in their right hands! Will they not say to him,
   "Thou didst forgive me all my sins by an authority committed unto thee,
   and yet here am I cast into the pit of hell?" Oh! if I do not clear my
   Soul upon this infamous business, and if the whole Christian church
   does not cleanse herself of it, what guilt will lay upon us! This is
   become a crying evil, and a sin that is not to be spoken of behind the
   door, nor to be handled in gentle language. I have been severe, it is
   said, and spoken harshly. I do not believe it possible to be too severe
   in this matter; but, sirs, if I have been so, let that be set down as
   my sin if you will; but is there any comparison between my fault and
   that of men who know this to be contrary to the Word of God, and yet
   give it their unfeigned assent and consent? or the sin of those who can
   lie unto the Holy Ghost, by pretending to confer Him who bloweth where
   he listeth upon men who as likely as not are as graceless as the very
   heathen? Fresh from the dissipations of college-life, the sinner bows
   before the man in lawn, and rises a full-blown priest, fully able to
   remit or retain sins. After this, how can the priests of the Church of
   England denounce the Roman Catholics? It is so very easy to fume and
   bluster against Puseyites and Papists; but the moment our charity
   begins at home, and we give our Evangelical brethren the same benefit
   which they confer upon the open Romanists, they are incensed beyond
   measure. Yet will we tell them to their faces, that they, despite their
   fair speeches, are as guilty as those whom they denounce; for there is
   as much Popery in this priest-making as in any passage in the
   mass-book. Protestant England! wilt thou long tolerate this blasphemy?
   Land of Wiclif, birthplace of the martyrs of Smithfield, is this long
   to be borne with? I am clear of this matter before the Most High, or
   hope to be, ere I sleep in the grave; and having once sounded the
   trumpet, it hall ring till my lips are dumb. Do you tell me it is no
   business of mine? Is it not the National Church?--does not its sin
   rest, therefore, upon every man and woman in the nation, Dissenter and
   Churchman, who does not shake himself from it by open disavowal? I am
   not meddling with anybody else's church; but the church that claims me
   as a parishioner would compel me, if it could, to pay its church rates,
   and that does take from me my share of tithe every year. I ask the
   sturdy Protestants of England, and especially the laity of the Church
   of England, whether they intend forever to foster such abominations?
   Arise, Britannia! nation of the free, and shake thy garments from the
   dust of this hoary superstition; and as for thee, O Church of England!
   may God bless thee with ministers who will sooner come forth to poverty
   and shame than pervert or assist in perverting the Word of God.

   6. I have not quite done: I have another question to ask. Look at the
   thanksgiving which is offered on the twentieth day of June, on account
   of Her Majesty's accession: in this thanksgiving we very heartily join,
   although we decline to pray by book on the twentieth of June or any
   other day; look at the close that thanksgiving, and you see the name of
   Lord John Russell as a sort of official authority for the prayer! Is
   Earl Russell also among the prophets? And on the other side of the
   page, in order that the Tories may edify the church as well as the
   Whigs, I see the hand of S. H. Walpole. Is he also a governor in
   Christ's church? Hath the Lord given these men power to legislate for
   his church, or sign mandates for her to obey? But what is it all about?
   "Victoria Regina, our will and pleasure is that these four forms of
   prayer," etc. Do you see? here is royal supremacy! Further on, in the
   next page: "Now, therefore, our will and pleasure is," etc. See the
   Preface to the Articles, "Being by God's Ordinance, according to our
   just Title, Defender of the Faith, and Supreme Governor of the Church,
   within these our Dominions;" and again, "We are Supreme Governor of the
   Church of England." This is the way in which your Church bows herself
   before the kingdoms of this world. I demand, earnestly demand, a "Thus
   saith the Lord" for this royal supremacy. If any king, or queen, or
   emperor shall say, in any Christian church, "Our will and pleasure is,"
   we reply, "We have another King,--one Jesus." As to the Queen, honored
   and beloved as she is, she is by her sex incapacitated for ruling in
   the church. Paul decides that point by his plain precept, "I suffer not
   a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in
   silence;" and if a king were in the case, we should say, "We render
   unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things
   which are God's." In civil matters, we cheerfully obey princes and
   magistrates; but if any king, queen, emperor, or what not, usurps power
   in the church of God, we reply, "One is our Master, even Christ, and
   all we are brethren. The crown-rights belong to King Jesus: he alone is
   King in Zion." But I am met at once with the reply, "Well, but Christ
   is the Head of the Established Church, as well as the Queen." I
   remember reading about a three-headed dog which kept the gates of hell,
   but I never dreamed of a two-headed church till I heard of the Anglican
   Establishment. A two-headed church is a monster! The Queen the Head of
   the Church, and King Jesus the Head of the Church, too! Never. Where is
   a "Thus saith the Lord" for this? No man living who calls himself an
   Englishman has a word to say of Her Majesty except that which is full
   of honor and esteem and loyal affection; but the moment we come to talk
   about the church of Christ, whoever shall say, or think, or believe,
   that there is any headship to the church of Christ except the person of
   Christ himself, he knoweth not what he saith nor whereof he affirmeth.
   Our Lord Jesus Christ is the Head over all things to his church, which
   is his body: the fulness of him filleth all in all. Here stand the two
   letters "V. R." at the top of certain mandates, and they mean just
   this: "Our royal authority commands that you shall not believe this,
   and you shall believe that; you shall not pray this, and you shall pray
   that; and you shall pray on such a day," and so on. The church which
   thus bows to authority commits fornication with the kings of the earth,
   and virtually renounces her allegiance to Christ to gain the filthy
   lucre of state endowments. He is the freeman whom the truth makes free,
   and who wears no gilded collar, with a chain hanging therefrom held in
   a royal hand. Remember how the Chancellor laughed to scorn the whole
   bench of bishops, and rightly so; for he who voluntarily makes himself
   a bondman deserves to feel the lash. May the little finger of our state
   grow heavier than the loins of James or Elizabeth, until all good men
   flee from the house of bondage. Servants of God, will ye be servants of
   man? Ye who profess to follow King Jesus and see him crowned with the
   crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, do
   you take off his diadem to put it upon the head of another? No, it
   shall never be. Scotland has repelled the royal intrusion right bravely
   by her sons of the Free Church, who have left all to follow King Jesus.
   Her bush burned in the olden times, but was not consumed; the covenant
   was stained with blood, but it was never slain. Let us revive that
   covenant, and, if need be, seal it with our blood. Let the Church of
   England have what king she pleases, or what prince she pleases for her
   head; but this I know, that there is no "Thus saith the Lord"
   concerning the ecclesiastical supremacy of Victoria Regina, nor the
   authority of Lord John Russell, or S. H. Walpole, or any of that
   company, honorable though they be.

   7. Now once more: one other question. I am profoundly ignorant, and
   have not the power to judge of these things (so am I informed), and
   therefore I would like to ask for a "Thus saith the Lord" for a few of
   the canons;--no, perhaps I had better not read them; they are too
   bad,--they are full of all malice and uncharitableness, and everything
   that cometh of the foul fiend. I will ask whether there can be found
   any "Thus saith the Lord" for this: Canon 10. "Maintainers of
   Schismatics in the Church of England to be censured. Whoever shall
   hereafter affirm that such ministers as refuse to subscribe to the form
   and manner of God's worship in the Church of England, prescribed in the
   Communion-Book, and their adherents, may truly take unto them the name
   of another church not established by law, and dare presume to publish
   it, that this their pretended church hath of long time groaned under
   the burden of certain grievances imposed upon it, and upon the members
   thereof before mentioned, by the Church of England, and the orders and
   constitutions therein by law established, let them be excommunicated,
   and not restored until they repent and publicly revoke such their
   wicked errors." What Scripture warrants one church to excommunicate
   another merely for being a church, and complaining of undoubted
   grievances?

   Canon 11. "Maintainers of Conventicles censured. Whosoever shall
   hereafter affirm or maintain that there are within this realm other
   meetings, assemblies, or congregations of the king's born subjects,
   than such as by the laws of this land are held and allowed, which may
   rightly challenge to themselves the name of true and lawful churches,
   let him be excommunicated, and not restored but by the Archbishop,
   after his repentance and public revocation of such his wicked errors."
   Where doth Holy Scripture authorize the excommunication of every good
   man who is charitable enough to believe that there are other churches
   beside his own? Search ye out of to book of the Lord, and read!

   For very much in this Book of Canons I beg to be informed of a "Thus
   saith the Lord." For matters which do not concern religion and have
   only to do with the mere arrangement of service, we neither ask nor
   expect a divine precept; but upon vital points of doctrine, ceremony,
   or precept, we cannot do without it. Scarcely can any document be more
   inconsistent with Scripture than the Book of Canons, and hence it is
   ever kept in the back ground, because those who know anything about it
   must be ashamed of it. And yet these are Canons of the Church of
   England,--canons which are inconsistent, many of them, with even the
   common rules of our own present enlightened law, let alone the Word of
   God. We ask a "Thus saith the Lord" for them, and we wait until a "Thus
   saith the Lord" shall be found to defend them.

   Now some will say, why do I thus take this matter up and look into it?
   I have already told you the reason, dear friends. There is an
   opportunity for pushing another Reformation given to us just now, of
   which if we do not avail ourselves we shall be very guilty. Some have
   said, "Why not go on preaching the gospel to sinners?" I do preach the
   gospel to sinners, as earnestly as ever I did in my life; and there are
   as many conversions to God as at any former period. This is God's work:
   and beware lest any of you lift a finger against it. The hand of the
   Lord is in this thing, and he that lives shall see it. Let us have our
   prayers, that good may come of this controversy, even though you may
   deplore it. As for anything else that you can do, it shall not turn us
   a hair's-breadth from this testimony to which we feel God has called
   us, though it bringeth upon us every evil that flesh would shrink from.
   The words of Dr. Guthrie are well worth quoting here: "The servant is
   no better than his master; and I do believe, were we more true to God,
   more faithful and honest in opposing the world for its good, we should
   get less smoothly along the path of life, and have less reason to read
   with apprehension these words of Jesus: Woe unto you when all men shall
   speak well of you.' Not less true than shrewd was the remark of a
   Scotch woman respecting one who, just settled in the ministry, had been
   borne to his pulpit amid the plaudits of all the people: If he is a
   faithful servant of the Lord Jesus Christ, he will have all the
   blackguards in the parish on his head before a month is gone.'"

   III. Now, to close, let me say to you, my hearers, have any of you a
   hope of heaven which will not stand the test of "Thus saith the Lord?"
   What are you resting upon? Are you resting upon something which you
   felt when excited at a prayer-meeting or under a sermon? Remember you
   will not have that excitement to bear you up in death, and the religion
   of excitement will not suffice in the day of judgment. Are you building
   upon your own works? Are you depending upon your own feelings? Do you
   rely upon sacraments? Are you placing your trust upon the word of man?
   If so, remember that when God shakes all things he will shake these
   false foundations; but oh! build upon the Word of my Lord and Master;
   trust your soul with Jesus. Hating sin, and clinging to the great
   sinbearer, you shall find in him a rock of refuge which can never,
   never fail you; but I do conjure you, as the Lord liveth, search and
   try yourselves by the Word of God. No doubt there are many among us who
   are not built upon the Rock of Ages, and we may any of us be deceived
   by a mere name to live. Do, then, since the test-day must come,--since
   you must be weighed in the balances,--weigh yourselves now, my hearers;
   and let none of us go down to the chambers of destruction believing
   ourselves to be heirs of heaven, being all the while enemies to the
   Most High God. May the Lord exalt his own Word, and give us a sure
   inheritance in the blessings which it brings. Amen.

                         The True Position Of Assurance

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, OCTOBER 2ND, 1864, BY C, H. SPURGEON, AT
   THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "In whom you also trusted, after that you heard the Word of Truth, the
   Gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that you believed, you
   were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise."

   Ephesians 1:13.

   MANY sincerely seeking souls are in great trouble because they have not
   yet attained to an assurance of their interest in Christ Jesus--they
   dare not take any comfort from their faith because they suppose that it
   has not attained to a sufficient strength. They have believed in the
   Lord Jesus and they have His promise that they shall be saved, but they
   are not content with this--they want to get assurance and then they
   suppose they shall have a better evidence of their salvation than the
   bare word of the Savior.

   Such persons are greatly mistaken. But as that mistake is a very
   painful one, and exercises the most injurious influence upon them, we
   will spend this morning in trying, as God shall help us, to clear up
   their difficulty. We want them to see that if they believe in the Lord
   Jesus Christ, even though they should not have attained to the precious
   Grace of full assurance of faith, yet nevertheless they are saved! And
   being justified by faith, they may rightfully enjoy peace with God
   through Jesus Christ our Lord!

   Their mistake seems to me to be this--they look for ripe fruit upon a
   tree in spring and because that season yields nothing but blossoms,
   they conclude the tree to be barren. They go to the head of a
   river--they find it a little rippling brook, and because it will not
   float a "Great Eastern," they conclude that it will never reach the
   sea, and that, in fact, it is not a true part of the river at all. They
   look upon themselves as being little children and such they are--but
   because they cannot speak plainly on account of having been so newly
   born, they therefore conclude that they are not the children of God at
   all!

   They see strong men in Christ Jesus performing great exploits. And
   because they, as yet, are but young and feeble, they conclude that they
   are not in the family of Grace. They compare themselves with giants in
   the Church of God and then, because they rightly perceive the
   difference between themselves and these mighty ones, they imagine that
   they are not saved--that they cannot be numbered among the faithful and
   have no part nor lot in this matter. They put the last things first.
   They make comforts essentials. They consider that which is the fruit of
   Grace to be the root of Grace. And herein they pierce themselves
   through with many sorrows.

   Perhaps they will not fall into this error again if they get a right
   understanding of the text before us. The Apostle Paul here explains the
   process by which sealing--the sealing of assurance--is obtained. There
   are three steps by which the hallowed elevation is reached. The first
   is hearing--they heard first the preaching of the Word. The second is
   believing. And then, thirdly, "after that you believed, you were sealed
   with the Holy Spirit of promise."

   I. To begin then, faith comes by HEARING. The preaching of the Gospel
   is God's soul-saving ordinance. It has pleased God by the "foolishness
   of preaching" to save them that believe. In every age God raises up men
   who faithfully proclaim His Word and, as he departs, another arrives.
   Elijah ascends to Glory, but his mantle falls upon Elisha. Paul dies
   not until Timothy is in the field. This true Apostolic succession is
   continued evermore, for when we know not where to find ministers, we
   may rest assured that in nooks and corners the Lord is preparing men
   for His work.

   The true preacher has a claim upon men's attention. If God has sent
   him, men should receive him. If he comes as an ambassador from the King
   of kings, let his commission be proved and he has a right to receive
   the careful and prayerful attention of all who come in his way. No,
   more--God's true ambassador not only claims a hearing, but he wins
   it--for there is an attractiveness in his theme which holds men by the
   ears! "I, if I am lifted up," said Christ, "will draw all men unto Me,"
   and among the other drawings there is this peculiar fact that men are
   drawn to hear where Christ is preached!

   He who preaches Christ has golden chains coming from his mouth with
   which he binds men's ears, if not their hearts. They are not all bound
   to salvation, but bound somehow they shall be--the savor shall go forth
   even though it should be a savor of death unto death and not of life
   unto life. The preacher claims a hearing and he wins it! What is that
   message which we are to hear in order to the attaining of faith, and,
   through faith, of full assurance?

   Our text is very expressive, for it tells us, "You heard the Word of
   Truth, the Gospel of your salvation." It is of little use to hear that
   which is not the Word of Truth--no, it is worse than useless--for by
   error we shall soon be misled. And if the preaching is not concerning
   the Word of Truth, even though it should be a word of truth, yet it can
   be of no value to the getting of faith--it must be the Word--the Word
   peculiarly above all others having the Truth of God and substance in
   it. There is no doubt that the expression here is a Hebraism for, "the
   true Word," you heard the true Word.

   O Brothers and Sisters, how joyous it is for us to know God's Word to
   be true! We have proved it in our own souls and thus can bear our
   witness to you concerning it. If we speak not according to the true
   Word of God, reject us, for that which will bless you must have a,
   "Thus says the Lord," to support it and must be based upon the
   Revelation of the Most High--otherwise it cannot be of saving service,
   seeing it is not the Word which is infallibly true!

   No doubt that the expression signifies the highest truth, truth as much
   the truth among other truths, as the Bible is the book above all other
   books. What I must hear for my salvation is not an important doctrine
   which may or may not be believed, but the Word without which men must
   perish in their sins. We may also remind you that the "Word of Truth"
   is a phrase peculiar to the contradistinction to the Law. Compare the
   Revelation of Christ with that of Moses--Moses revealed much Gospel
   Truth, but it was in shadows, not by a plain word of teaching--and
   therefore we now declare that the Law was given by Moses--but Grace and
   Truth came by Jesus Christ.

   Christ is the Substance of all those shadows which Moses had to bring
   before the people's minds. And therefore there is an emphasis about the
   Gospel as being not metaphorical Truth, but solid Truth--the essential
   Truth of God. As the mountain towers high above the surrounding plain,
   so the great Truth that, "God was made flesh and dwelt among us"--the
   faithful saying that, "Jesus Christ came into the world to seek and to
   save sinners"--towers above all other Truths of God and demands our
   first and our best thoughts. And as the sun outshines all other lights,
   even so the manifestation of Truth in the Gospel of Christ excels all
   other Revelations. It is the Word of Truth.

   But the text also adds, "the Gospel"--"the Gospel of your salvation."
   You are to listen to the Gospel--to that which is good news--to a
   something totally new to the world's natural religion--a something
   which came fresh from God--God's great novelty--something good--good in
   the deepest sense--infinitely good--good for your soul's best
   interests--good in answering the craving appetite of your poor hungry
   spirit. It must be good news--it must be evangelical doctrine to which
   you must listen if you would get faith!

   Faith does not come by seeing. Men do not get faith by looking at a
   priest manipulating bread and wine, or sprinkling drops of baptismal
   water. The symbols of the Church of Rome do not beget faith. They may
   beget attention. They may please the fancy and delight the taste, but
   they do not beget the faith of God's elect. It is the Gospel--the
   Gospel preached and heard which does this through the power of the Holy
   Spirit! We do not get faith through ordinances--no matter if God
   Himself prescribed them. They are not the channel through which faith
   comes. The Apostle expressly declares that, "faith comes by hearing and
   hearing by the Word of God."

   It is not through eye-gate, but through ear-gate, that salvation comes
   to us. God may, and doubtless does, infuse Grace into us by channels
   other than the sense of hearing. But, at any rate, the usual way in
   which Grace comes streaming into the soul is by hearing--and that is
   the hearing of the Gospel--not the hearing of tradition! Not the
   hearing of supposition! Not the hearing of poetic imaginations, but the
   hearing of that old evangel, which was first proclaimed by Jesus on the
   Mount and afterwards by His Apostles and to this day is still
   proclaimed with trumpet-tongue by those who know its quickening power!

   You must hear the Gospel--and observe it is called "the Gospel of your
   salvation." You will never get faith, dear Friends, unless you look
   upon the Gospel as the great means of salvation and come earnestly
   enquiring and desiring that it may be made to you the Gospel of your
   salvation! Not of another man's, but of your salvation. I cannot say to
   every unconverted man, "This Gospel will save you," but I can say
   this--if you receive this Gospel, it certainly will--and that the
   moment it is accepted by the heart it is the Gospel of your salvation.

   Reject it--it will be a savor of death unto death to you! But if the
   Holy Spirit shall come with it and command your will and win your
   assent and consent, then it is, indeed, the Gospel of your salvation.
   Are you a sinner? "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners."
   Inasmuch as this is worthy of all acceptance, it is worthy of your
   acceptance and is, in a sense, even now the Gospel of your salvation!
   We know that Christ came to "seek and to save that which was lost." Are
   you lost? Then in a sense it is the Gospel of your salvation, seeing
   that you are lost. If you can grasp that cheering Word with the hand of
   faith, you will say, "Yes, lost as I am, I believe Christ came to save
   the lost and I trust Him alone to save me." Then it is the Gospel of
   your salvation in a very high and special sense, seeing that now you
   have been saved by it!

   The great end, it seems to me, of the preaching of the Gospel is just
   this--the preacher should always be aiming so to preach it that he may
   find out those souls to whom this is the Gospel of their salvation--so
   laboring to bring it home, both by persuading by the terrors of the Law
   and by the love of Jesus! Then men shall--through the Spirit of God
   accompanying the Word--be led, through hearing, to lay hold upon Christ
   and so to be saved! Thus I have set forth what you have to hear.

   May I beg you carefully to judge every preacher, not by his gifts, not
   by his elocutionary powers, not by his status in society, not by the
   respectability of his congregation, not by the prettiness of his
   Church, the grandeur of the ceremonies, or the peculiar beauty of his
   vestments, but by this--does he preach the Word of Truth, the Gospel of
   your salvation? If he does, your sitting under his ministry may prove
   to you the means of getting faith. But if he does not, you cannot
   expect God's blessing, for you are not using God's ordinance but the
   ordinance of man.

   The hearing of the Gospel involves the hearer in responsibility. It is
   a great privilege to hear the Gospel. You may smile and think there is
   nothing very great in it. The damned in Hell know! Oh, what would they
   give if they could hear the Gospel now--if they could come back and
   entertain but a shadow of a hope that they might yet escape from the
   wrath to come? The saved in Heaven estimate this privilege at a high
   rate, for, having obtained salvation and eternal life through the
   preaching of this Gospel, they can never cease to bless their God for
   calling them by His Word of Truth.

   that you knew it! On your dying beds the listening to a Gospel sermon
   will seem another thing than it seems now. Now you may come out of
   curiosity, and go away and forget it. But when grim Death and you shall
   stand face to face, you will find it quite another thing to have had
   God's Word spoken to you and you will hear such a word as this, "You
   stumbled at the Word because you were disobedient and therefore woe has
   come upon you to the uttermost." I must also add that if hearing is
   really so gracious an ordinance, it becomes Christian men and women to
   pray the Lord to send forth laborers into His vineyard--to entreat Him
   to bless all efforts used to train our young ministers for future
   conflict.

   1 beg you not to forget to aid our Pastor's College both with your
   gifts and your prayers! It should bring afresh to the thoughts of all
   of you the duty of praying for those who are engaged in preaching the
   Word, for their preaching is nothing, except as the Spirit goes with
   it. And though, when the Spirit goes with it the shout of the King is
   heard in our camps, let Him withdraw and there is nothing but
   disappointment and dismay in the hosts of God. Pray for us, Brethren!

   We trust we have a good conscience and endeavor to free ourselves of
   the blood of souls. We want our hearers to pray for us and hold up our
   hands as Aaron and Hur held up the hands of Moses on the mount. Be
   diligent in hearing the Word. If you are saved, still listen to it for
   your soul's health. If you are not saved, neglect no opportunities of
   listening. Lie at this pool of Bethesda--who can tell but you may yet
   step in when the angel does move the waters--or Jesus Himself may come
   and walk through those five porches and bid you take up your bed and
   walk?

   Waste no Sunday in going where you cannot hear the Gospel! And when you
   hear the Gospel, hear it with all your ears--give your whole soul to
   it--as the thirsty earth drinks in the descending showers, so drink in
   the Word of God! As new-born babes receive the unadulterated milk of
   the Word, so receive that which is able to save your souls! And through
   hearing may faith come and through faith may you gain the assurance
   which you so earnestly desire.

   II. After hearing came BELIEF. We know that believing does not always
   immediately follow hearing. There is a case told of Mr. Flavel having
   preached a sermon which was blessed to a man, I think eighty-five years
   afterwards, so that the seed may lay long buried in dust! Yet, had not
   that man heard that sermon, speaking after the manner of men, he had
   not received the quickening Word of God!

   You may have heard the Gospel long in vain and it should be to you a
   source of very serious enquiry if you have done so--it should set you
   trembling lest the Word should never be the savor of life unto you. But
   at the same time do not renounce the hearing because up to now you have
   had no blessing, for faith comes by hearing. Continue to listen!
   Continue to search the Word. And if your soul desires faith, God denies
   not faith to any in whom He has really implanted a desire after it.
   Faith will yet, we trust, come while you are hearing. This belief, you
   observe, is called trusting. Kindly look at the verse--"In whom you
   also trusted."

   The translators have borrowed that word, "trusted," very properly, from
   the twelfth verse. Do not, because you see it in italics, think that it
   is not properly there. It is not in the original, but being in the
   twelfth verse it is very rightly understood here. Believing, then, is
   trusting. If you want it summed up in the shortest word, it is just
   this--trusting Christ. A message comes to me upon good authority--I
   believe it. Believing it, I necessarily trust it. My receiving of the
   message is so far good, but the essential act, the act essential to
   salvation is the trusting--the trusting Christ.

   The process of faith may be thus illustrated. You know a friend of
   yours to be perfectly reliable--you are in debt. He tells you that if
   you will trust him to pay the debt, he will give you, on the spot, a
   receipt for it. Now you look at him. You consider his ability to pay
   it. You consider the probability that he means what he is saying.
   Having once made up your mind that he is truthful, you could not then
   say, "I cannot believe you." If you once know that person to be
   truthful, I utterly deny that you can hold any argument about your
   power to believe him!

   So, if Jesus Christ declares that He came into the world to save
   sinners, and, if He tells me, as He does tell me, that "whosever
   believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life"--if I am
   already enabled by God's Spirit to believe in the perfect truthfulness
   of Christ, I should be lying unto my own soul if I said I had not power
   to believe in Him. Understand, power to believe in Christ is the gift
   of the Holy Spirit. But the Holy Spirit has given that power to all men
   who know the perfect truthfulness of Christ.

   It must be so, if you just look at it for a moment--it must be so. If I
   know the perfect truthfulness of a man, I lie if I say to him, "I
   cannot believe you." Why, it follows, as a matter of course that I must
   believe if I am convinced that he is worthy of credit. Just so, when I
   am assured of Christ that His Testimony is worthy of my belief--I have
   no right, then, to plead that I cannot believe Him. Mark, I am only
   speaking to those who have got as far as that and there are hundreds of
   you who have! When you tell me you cannot believe, I reply, "My dear
   Friend, you can believe. In the Holy Spirit's giving you enough
   enlightenment to know that Christ is faithful and true, that
   enlightenment is your power to believe!"

   And this is according to the rules of common sense as well as according
   to the rules of experience. Do not stand, therefore, and say, "I cannot
   believe what Christ says." Do you believe Him to be true? "Yes," you
   say, "I dare not say otherwise." Then you can believe what He says. But
   do you really believe that Christ is true? I fear you do not. I believe
   that John discovered the secret of your unbelief when he said, "He that
   believes not has made God a liar, because he has not believed on His
   Son." That is the bottom line.

   You really think God is a liar! Do you shrink from that charge? Ah, but
   I must bring it against you again, for if you know God to be true, I
   insist upon it and your own reason tells you it is so--that you cannot
   help believing in a person you know to be true! I fear that you are
   making God a liar. And if you deny that charge, then I arrest you at
   the other point at once and demand of you that you do now exercise
   faith and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ! It is trusting Christ that
   saves the soul!

   Now a few remarks about believing. Faith in Christ is the work of God's
   Holy Spirit. In proof of this we have many Scriptures. No man ever did
   yet believe in Christ until the Holy Spirit had quickened him and
   illuminated his understanding so that he perceived the truthfulness of
   Christ's Character and was then led to trust Him. But in the next
   place, although faith is the work of the Spirit, it is the act of man.
   The Holy Spirit does not believe for me--there is nothing for Him to
   believe! Repentance is the work of the Holy Spirit, but the Holy Spirit
   does not repent--He has nothing to repent of. He works in me to will
   and to do, but I will and I do--He does not will nor do what I ought to
   will and do.

   If I have a person here who is ignorant and I teach him--when he
   acquires knowledge, that knowledge is my gift to him and my work in
   him. At the same time he acquires that knowledge himself, and it would
   never have been his if he had not yielded up his faculties to be
   taught. Man believes. And whenever persons say to you, "Well, if it is
   the work of the Holy Spirit, how can it be the duty of man?" remind
   them that while it is the work of the Holy Spirit, it is not the act of
   the Holy Spirit, The Holy Spirit does not believe--it is the man who
   believes.

   The Spirit moves upon us and by His mysterious agency takes away the
   natural unbelief of the soul and then we believe. But man is not
   passive in the act of believing. A dead man does not believe--the man
   is quickened and then his quickened spirit lays hold of the revealed
   Truth of God. Observe this, further, that faith is due to Christ. The
   faithful and true witness demands of me that I should believe what He
   says. Sinner, this is the unkindest cut you can give to Christ-- to
   doubt Him. I tell you that all His sufferings on the tree did not
   insult Him so much as when you say, "I cannot trust You."

   What? Not trust the eternal arm on which the earth hangs? Not trust the
   bleeding hands which have opened the gates of Heaven for the very chief
   of sinners? Not trust the streaming side out of which there gushes
   blood and water to cleanse the guilt and the power of sin? Not trust
   God's own Son, the Mighty God, the Redeemer of Men? It is due to Him
   that you should, with your whole heart, lean upon Him and give Him all
   your confidence. This faith is essential to salvation. Assurance is not
   essential, but no man can be saved unless he trusts in the Lord Jesus
   Christ. You may get to Heaven with a thousand doubts and fears--you may
   get to Heaven without some of those Graces of the Spirit which are the
   ornaments of the Believer's neck! But you cannot get there without the
   life-giving Grace offaith.

   You must have that and so long as you continue to say, "I will not
   trust Christ. I want dreams, visions, experiences, revelations. I want
   terrors of conviction. I want this, I want the other"--so long you shut
   yourself out of peace. Till you set your seal to God's Word, God will
   never set His seal to your faith. Remark, again, this faith is not
   required in any particular degree. In order to salvation, it is not
   declared in Scripture that you are to believe to a certain strength--if
   you have faith as small as a grain of mustard seed--if that is a
   mountain-moving faith, surely it shall be a soul-saving faith!

   Faith is not to be estimated by its quantity but by its quality. If you
   have no more faith than a smoking flax has of fire, yet He will not
   quench you--if you have no more power of faith than a bruised reed has
   of strength, yet He will not break you! If you are not a man, but an
   infant in Grace--no, if you are scarcely a healthy infant, if there is
   but faith in you, though you are cast out as unswaddled and
   unwashed--yet He passes by and looks upon you! Can you but trust Him?
   THAT is the thing. If you do but trust Him as a drowning man clutches a
   rope. If you look to Jesus, as it were, out of the corner of your eye,
   though there are so many tears in your eyes that you cannot see Him so
   completely as you desire--though you cannot see Him at all to your
   comfort--yet you see Him to salvation! If you have received Him, desire
   great faith, but remember that little faith will carry you to Heaven
   through Jesus Christ.

   Observe, further, that this faith is very variable, but it is not
   perishable. Faith may go to an ebb, as the tide does, but it will come
   to a flood again. When faith is at its flood, the man is not,
   therefore, more saved! And when faith is at its ebb, the man is not,
   therefore, less saved! For, after all, salvation does not lie in faith,
   but in Christ. And faith is but the connecting link between the soul
   and Christ. Faith may take Christ up in its arms, like Simeon, and it
   is true faith. But, on the other hand, faith may only venture to touch
   the hem of Jesus' garment and that faith makes men whole.

   Some of us can look the Savior in the face and even kiss Him with the
   kisses of our mouth and others may only venture to come behind Him in
   the throng, all timid and afraid--but faith, if it is faith, let it
   change as it may--still saves. Faith--if it is faith--let it sink as it
   may, never can drown--it may live in the flames, but it shall never be
   burned. He who once gets this incorruptible seed, shall find it lives
   and abides in him forever. This faith is worked in us by the Spirit of
   God, according to the laws of the mind.

   When God works upon matter, He works according to the laws of matter. I
   do not find, apart from miracles, that God violates gravitation--that
   He breaks any of the great laws with which He has stamped matter. And
   when the Spirit of God comes to work on man, He does not break the laws
   with which He regulates the mind. Now, it seems to be one of the laws
   of the mind that a man should believe a thing not by trying to believe
   it, but by force of evidence. If you now sit down, for instance, and
   try to believe in the explosion of the powder magazines yesterday--if
   you have any doubt about it, you may try, as long as you like, to
   believe it--you cannot do it by trying. You must go through another
   process. You cannot pump faith up from your own mind.

   How do I get to believe in the explosion of the powder mills? There are
   certain newspapers--I have confidence in those newspapers and as I read
   the account--I believe it. Or I meet with certain persons who either
   heard the explosion, or saw some of the effects produced thereby and
   now I believe without any effort at all--I cannot help believing!
   Belief comes necessarily from my having confidence in those who tell me
   so. Now, the Spirit of God, when about to produce faith, frequently
   leads men to think about Christ. Christ is set forth before them
   crucified. They perceive that, "Here is a great wonder--God clothed in
   human flesh to suffer for human sin!"

   The mind thinks, "There is something here which meets my conscious
   needs. I can see how God can be just, for He punishes His Son--and how
   He can be gracious, for He forgives sin. I find it stated that if I
   trust myself in this Son of God, who suffered as Man and now pleads His
   infinite merits before the Throne of God--if I trust in Him I shall be
   saved. I cannot trust in Him by simply saying I will try to do it, but
   I look at the Bible--is that true? I look at the thing itself--does it
   look like truth?" I ask friends who have tried and proved it and they
   tell me that they have tasted that He is gracious. Upon this evidence
   and specially upon perceiving the power of this Truth of God in my own
   soul, I believe the Word of God. The Spirit of God, working thus, leads
   me from the evidence given, to believe the testimony borne and I
   believe it.

   Dear Friends, if you want to get faith, it must come through the Spirit
   of God! But it usually comes in this way--if the Word is not blessed to
   you in hearing it and meditating upon it at home--thinking much of
   Christ and His great work--what you have been doing is this--you have
   been thinking of your sins only. What would you think of a judge who
   sat upon a bench and who would listen to all the complaints against a
   criminal, but as soon as the advocate arose to plead his cause, would
   say, "No, I do not intend to listen to that"? You have been doing that.
   Your poor soul stands on trial and you have been listening to the
   accusations of Satan and your own sins!

   And the moment Christ gets up to show you His great Atonement--the
   moment the promise is quoted--you say, "It is presumption for me to
   hope." My dear Friends, it is never presumption to listen to the Truth
   of God. If it is true that in due time Christ died for the ungodly. If
   it is true that he who comes to Him He will in no wise cast out. If it
   is true that He has said, "Though your sins are as scarlet, they shall
   be as white as snow. Though they are red like crimson, they shall be as
   wool." If it is true that He has said, "I have blotted out, as a thick
   cloud, your transgressions and, as a cloud, your sins," why not listen
   to that as well as the other?

   Surely you must look at the fair side as well as the foul. And while
   your ear is hearing of the work of Christ and the promise of God, you
   will be able to cry--

   "I do believe, I must believe, That Jesus died for me.
   "I could not have thought it! Oh, it melts me! I have been trying to
   get a soft heart and could not get it, but I have it now all through
   this. Here have I been hurrying to and fro, looking after faith and
   assurance instead of looking to the Cross for it! But now I see it all
   and I am saved, for I trust in Jesus Christ alone!"

   I have said as much as may be needed this morning upon faith. I have
   tried to be brief upon each point and packed as many things as I could
   into the time. Now we are to have a few words about assurance.

   III. The text says, "You were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise."
   I cannot take the fourteenth verse, except to hint at it--we will try
   and preach on that this evening. Sealing, which is another name for
   assurance, for the witness of the Holy Spirit with our spirit--that we
   are born of God, is evidently distinct from faith. Please observe
   that--for the text says, "After that you believed, you were sealed with
   the Holy Spirit of promise." Believing, then, is not this sealing.

   And assurance, although it is akin to believing, is not believing.
   There is a distinction between the two things. I want you to notice the
   distinction. In faith the mind is active. The text uses verbs which
   imply action--"you trusted," "you believed." But when it comes to
   sealing it uses quite another verb--"you were sealed." I am active in
   believing--I am passive when the Holy Spirit seals me. The witness of
   the Spirit is a something which I receive, but faith is a something
   which I exercise as well as receive. In faith my mind does
   something--in being sealed my faith receives something. If I may say
   so, faith writes out the document--there she labors--but the Holy
   Spirit stamps the seal Himself and there is no hand wanted there except
   His own. He stamps His own impression to make the document valid.
   Notice the difference between the activeness and the passiveness.

   Then, again, man is commanded to believe in Scripture in many
   places--but he never was commanded to be sealed. Faith is a duty as
   well as a privilege, but assurance a privilege only. I never find any
   man exhorted to get the sealing of the Spirit. I believe that every
   Christian should pray for it and seek it, but I know of no command. It
   is a gift, a priceless gift and, unlike faith, it does not constitute a
   subject or command. Again, we read in Scripture that men are saved by
   faith and live by faith, but neither salvation nor living are ever
   imputed to sealing or to assurance. We are not saved by assur-ance--we
   do not even live by assurance. The vital principle is couched in faith.
   That is the shell which holds the kernel of the inner spiritual life.

   I may be saved though I never had assurance. But even if I fancied I
   had assurance, I could not be saved if I had not faith. To faith we say
   salvation is promised, but to assurance such a promise is not given. It
   is clear from the context that assurance follows faith--"after that you
   believed." The Apostle does not say how soon. I believe that many souls
   get full assurance with faith. I have known converts who have been as
   certified of their interest in Christ as though they had been seventy
   years experimentally walking with Him. But, mark you, this is not the
   case always--perhaps not often.

   Brookes gives the case of a Mr. Frogmorton who was one of the most
   valuable ministers of his day, but was thirty-seven years without any
   assurance of his interest with Christ. He trusted Christ, but his
   ministry was always a gloomy one, for he could not read his title clear
   to mansions in the skies. He went to the house of a dear friend, Mr.
   Dodd, to die. Just before he died, the light of Heaven streamed in--he
   not only expressed his full assurance of faith, but triumphed so
   gloriously, that he was the wonder of all round about him!

   He also tells us of one Mr. Glover, who had been for years without
   assurance of his interest in Christ. But when he came to the fire to be
   burnt, just as he saw the stake, he cried, "He is come! He is come!"
   And instead of being heavy of heart as he had been in prison, he went
   to the stake with a light step! Three martyrs were once chained to the
   stake, two of them rejoicing. But one was observed to slip from under
   the chains for a moment and prostrate himself upon the firewood and
   wrestle with God and then coming back to the stake, he said, "The Lord
   has manifested himself to me at the last and now I shall burn bravely."
   And so, indeed, he did, bearing his witness for his Lord and Master.

   So it seems there are some of God's saints who do not get assured till
   even the last moment and I will not say that there are not some of them
   who even, like some children, are put to bed in the dark. Christ went
   up to Heaven in a cloud--Gideon saw the angel ascending in the smoke of
   the incense and many a good man ascends with clouds of darkness round
   about him--but still he goes to Heaven! I hope these cases are very
   few--still we bring them forward to show you that assurance is not to
   be looked for before faith. You might as well look for the pinnacle
   before the foundation, for the cream before the milk, for the apples
   before you plant the tree--for the harvest before you sow the seed.
   Assurance follows faith.

   Observe in the next place--and it is worthy of your notice--that
   assurance is to be found where faith was found. Do observe those two
   words, "in whom"--"in whom you also trusted"--"in whom you were
   sealed." So that as I get my faith out of Christ, so I must get my
   assurance out of Christ. The virtual means of my faith is Christ
   Himself and the virtual means of my assurance must be the same. As I
   think of what He did for me, I believe in Him. As I continue to
   meditate upon that same thing, I have assurance of interest in Him. You
   must feed upon the flesh and blood of Christ if you would grow into
   strong men in Christ Jesus. A touch of Christ will heal you from all
   disease--but you must hold Him fast if you would enjoy spiritual health
   perpetually.

   To believe in Christ will save you from Hell. To be assured of your
   interest in Christ will give you a Heaven upon earth! Do not be content
   with faith--be thankful for it, rejoice in it--but ask to have more.
   And when you want to have more, go to Christ for it--the same fountain
   which first quenched your thirst must be that which shall quench it
   till you are taken up to drink of the River of Life which flows through
   the midst of Paradise--which is no other than the Presence of Christ as
   a refreshment to His people.

   This assurance, like faith, is the work of the Spirit of God. "You were
   sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise." He does this in various ways.
   Sometimes we get the seal of the Spirit through experience. We know
   that God is true because we have proved Him. Sometimes this comes
   through the hearing of the Word--as we listen our faith is confirmed.
   But there is doubtless, besides this, a special and supernatural work
   of the Holy Spirit whereby men are assured that they are born of God.
   You will observe in one place the Apostle says, "The Spirit also bears
   witness with our spirit, that we are born of God," so that there are
   two witnesses--first, our spirit bears witness, that is, by evidences.
   I look at my faith and see myself depending upon Christ and then I
   know, because I love the Brethren and for other reasons, that I am born
   of God.

   Then there comes over and above the witness of evidence, faith and
   feeling--the Spirit Himself bearing witness with our spirit. Have you
   not felt it? I cannot describe this to you, but you who have felt it
   know it. Did you not the other day feel a heavenly calm as you
   meditated upon your state and condition in Christ? You wondered where
   it came from. It was not the result of protracted devotion but it stole
   over you--you knew not how it was--you were bathed in it as in sunlight
   and you rejoiced exceedingly. You rejoiced in Christ--that was your
   basis of confidence, and that confidence came through the Spirit
   bearing witness with your spirit.

   This has occurred sometimes in the midst of sharp conflicts just when
   dark despair seemed ready to overwhelm you. You may have enjoyed this
   comfort under peculiar trials and losses of friends and you may expect
   to have it when you come to die. Then, if ever in your life, you should
   be able to say, "I will fear no evil, for You are with me (in a special
   sense) You are with me." The Holy Spirit, then, must give it to us, and
   we must wait upon Him to set His seal. And so to conclude, this is
   desirable to the highest degree, for it is the earnest of the
   inheritance. It is a part of Heaven on earth to get an assurance worked
   by the Spirit!

   It is not merely a pledge, for a pledge is given back when you get the
   thing itself, but it is an earnest. It is one cluster from the vines of
   Eshcol--one shekel of the eternal wage--money of the Free Grace reward.
   What if I say it is a stray note from the harps of angels? It is a drop
   of the spray from the fountains of life. It is one ingot of gold from
   the pavement of Heaven. It is one ray of heavenly light from the
   eternal Sun of Righteousness. O Christian, if you have ever known
   assurance, you will pant till you have it again! You can never, after
   seeing the sunlight, put up with the candlelight of your doubts and
   fears in the dungeon of despondency.

   But if assurance is gone, still hang onto Jesus--

   "When your eye of faith is dim, Still hold onto Jesus, sink or swim.
   Still at His footstool bow the knee, And Israel's God your peace shall
   be." If you cannot feel His love in your heart, still trust Him! Oh, it
   was grand of Job--"Though He slay me, yet will I trust Him." Truly, the
   vitality of faith is such that if He should spurn me from His
   Presence--if He never gave me another look of love this side of
   Heaven--if He gave me up to the lowest depths and bade all His waves
   and billows go over me, yet is He such a faithful God and so true that
   I dare not even, then, doubt Him. Blind unbelief would do so, but
   victorious faith says, "Never! He cannot lie. Let God be true and every
   man a liar."

   When faith is at her very worst, she is glorious and sparkles like a
   jewel in the dark mine and God will come and take her up out of all the
   depths and set her in His own crown as a precious jewel. "Your faith
   has saved you," says Jesus. No, Lord, it is not faith that has done it,
   it is Yourself. He takes the crown royal of salvation's glory, lifts it
   right off from His own head and puts it on the head of the poor feeble
   woman's faith. "Your faith has saved you: go in peace." And so will God
   do with your tempest-tossed and exercised faith! He will put the crown
   upon it and that faith of yours shall sing in Heaven!

   Do not tell me that we shall have no faith in Heaven--nonsense! "Now
   abides faith, hope, charity, these three. But the greatest of these is
   charity." We shall find faith to be our sweet companion there. Shall I
   not believe God when I get to Heaven? Shall I give up trusting my God
   when I get there? No, I shall trust Him for my resurrection body! I
   shall trust Him for the millennial splendor! I shall trust Him for the
   gathering of the elect! Trust Him for an eternity of bliss! Trust Him
   for my safe standing where He has brought me. And so, happy faith,
   imperishable faith, shall live and reign when sense and sight are gone
   past recall. The Lord give you to hear the Word, to believe in it and
   afterwards to be sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise.

                                Inward Conflicts

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, OCTOBER 9, 1864,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon
   you. What will you see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two
   armies. Song of Solomon 6:13.

   THIS verse is not addressed to the Church in her doubting state, nor
   while seeking her absent Lord, but it refers to her in her very best
   condition--when she has lately come from the enjoyment of fellowship
   with her Divine spouse and when her soul, in consequence is like the
   chariots of Amminadib. Read the context and you will perceive that
   Believers who are rejoicing in the Lord may look upon this text as
   their own. Observe the title of the person addressed--it is a marriage
   name. She has been espoused to Solomon and she has taken his name and
   become Solyma, for such is the best rendering of the word rendered
   Shulamite. This name is appropriate to souls who are united to Christ,
   to those whom Christ has betrothed unto Himself in righteousness, who
   live in union with their Lord.

   You who abide in the Lord Jesus are, by a mysterious bond, made one
   with Christ. And He has conferred upon you His own name--He is Solomon
   and you are Solyma. That is a remarkable expression in the book of
   Jeremiah--"This is her name whereby she shall be called, the Lord our
   Righteousness." One would have thought that such a title was
   incommunicable. But yet so close is the union between Christ and His
   people that the Holy Spirit actually transfers that dignified
   expression, "Lord our Righteousness," to His Israel--His Beloved.

   The title Solyma also signifies both perfection and peace. There is
   perfection in every child of God, but not a perfection in the flesh. We
   are perfect in Christ Jesus! We are complete in Him--spotless, by being
   washed in His blood-- glorious, by being robed in His righteousness.
   Every child of God is right sumptuously arrayed in the wedding dress of
   the Savior's righteousness. We may truly say that, "Solomon in all his
   glory was not arrayed like one of these." Every Believer stands in
   Christ perfectly accepted!

   The sweet name, Solyma, also signifies peace--"Therefore being
   justified by faith, we have peace with God through Jesus Christ our
   Lord." The true heir of Heaven is not at enmity with God, nor at war
   with his own conscience. The silver trumpet has proclaimed an
   everlasting peace. God's sword has been sheathed in the Savior's heart
   and Divine Justice is on the side of the chosen people. The request of
   the text next demands a moment's consideration. It is repeated four
   times. "Return, return, O Solyma. Return, return, that we may look upon
   you." Does not this request proceed from the daughters of Jerusalem who
   desire to behold her beauty?

   Souls that are anxious about their own state may well desire to
   understand the experience of the true child of God. You want to know
   whether you, also, are a Christian, therefore you want to know how
   Christians feel, how they think of Christ, how they are moved by His
   Spirit--what is their appearance when His love is shed abroad in their
   hearts. You anxiously desire to see the true Christian that you may
   measure yourselves and see whether there is the life of God in you.
   These daughters of Jerusalem also desire to look upon her for their own
   delight. For as to gaze upon beauty is exceedingly pleasant--so is it
   specially delightful to the pure in heart to have fellowship with the
   pure in heart--to see the fruits which the Spirit has brought forth. To
   behold the cleanness of the Believer's walk and to know the savor of
   the Believer's conversation.

   No beauty equals the beauty of holiness! Nothing is so lovely as
   uprightness. And therefore we wonder not that four times the request is
   made. Perhaps, too, these daughters wanted to look at her as an example
   to themselves. Saints look upon the beauty of others that they may be
   enabled to emulate their excellencies. Let us read with affectionate
   attention the biographies of holy men that they may be a stimulus to
   ourselves, exciting us to exert ourselves in the Redeemer's cause and
   may afford us some hope that the highest Christian attainments are not
   altogether beyond our reach. I think this is the reason why the
   daughters of Jerusalem said, "Return, return, O Solyma"--they would
   comfort themselves by seeing whether they are like she is.

   They would delight themselves by beholding her perfections. They would
   also stir up their own souls by seeing her example. The rest of the
   text, you will observe, may be considered two ways--either the spouse
   asks the question, which is the most probable. She says, "What shall
   you see in Solyma?" She thinks that there is no beauty in her, nothing
   in her that anyone should delight, or fix his eyes upon her, or derive
   any profit from regarding her. "Why," she says, "all that You will see
   in me is a company of two armies--a conflict between good and evil. If
   You look upon me You see nothing but good and evil fighting together,
   darkness and light contending. I am not worth Your looking at."

   And so she would gladly veil her face and go away if it were not for
   the earnest request which seems to hold her fast--or as some think,
   this question is asked by bystanders and is answered by the daughters
   of Jerusalem--"What shall you see in the Shulamite?" the giddy crowd
   enquires. And instructed Believers cry, "We shall see in her the
   concurrence of two triumphant armies returning as choristers with music
   and with dancing, from the field of battle! We shall see in her the
   King immortal, invisible, with all His hosts of Grace! We shall see in
   her the purified soul co-working with the glorious Savior! We shall see
   in the Christian Church the activity of sanctified manhood, combined
   with the majestic power of Deity residing within."

   This is what she might not say of herself. But what they would see in
   her. Observe, then, the two meanings and let us dismiss the second
   until another occasion. There is in every Christian a sweet composition
   of Christ's power and of the activity of his own soul. There is the
   power of God and there is the creature himself made willing in the day
   of God's power. There is in the Christian, God working in him to will
   and to do of His own good pleasure and the man himself working out his
   own salvation with fear and trembling. In the Christian Church there is
   man working for God and God working in man--and all this in such a
   joyful manner as to be rather resembling the triumph of returning
   conquerors than the going forth to fight of those who make war. What
   shall we see in Solyma? We shall see the blessed confluence of the two
   great armies of sanctified humanity and of God made flesh!

   But we are now coming to take the text in the first sense--the Church
   blushingly declares that there is nothing to be seen in her except
   conflict, turmoil, the wrestling of two great powers--two mighty armies
   contending for the mastery. Upon this point may God give us light for
   the comfort of many who are passing through this stage of Christian
   experience.

   I. We shall, at the outset, this morning, first call upon you who know
   the Lord to OBSERVE THE FACT OF THE TWO ARMIES IN EVERY CHRISTIAN. This
   is very evident, but to aid your reflections let me remind you
   throughout this very book you see traces of it. This Canticle is a
   marriage song--it therefore speaks less of the battlefield than some
   other portions of Scripture, for at the marriage feast allusions to
   trial and to warfare ought to be few.

   Yet, that the Church is not altogether sanctified is clear if you note
   such passages as the fifth verse of the first chapter. "I am black,"
   she says, "but lovely, O you daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of
   Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon." She is black--here is her natural
   state--here we have the manifestation of her continued depravity of
   heart. "I am black, but lovely"--here is her spiritual condition--the
   Spirit of God has clothed her with beauteous graces--Christ has washed
   her and made her fair in His sight. "I am like the tents of Kedar," she
   says, "the smoke-dried curtains of those Arab wanderers who dwelt in
   this country set forth my sinfulness."

   And yet in Christ she compares herself to those embroidered curtains,
   heavy with gold and silver threads which hang about the throne of
   Solomon. In the third chapter she plainly proves that she is not always
   enjoying fellowship, but is in a mixed condition. "By night on my
   bed"--here is her slothfulness--"I sought Him whom my soul loves"--here
   is her activity. "I sought Him"--here is her desire--"but I found Him
   not"--here is her sad experience of His absence. Then in the fifth
   chapter, the second verse, there is a singular commixture. "I sleep"--I
   am sluggish, cold, dead, lethargic-- "but my heart wakes"--the inward
   principle is still vital, still panting after something better.

   We find her in the third verse making vain excuses for not opening to
   her Lord. But before long you come to the fifth verse and you find her
   opening to her Beloved, though her Beloved has withdrawn--refusing but
   soon complying. The two natures battling. The one fast closing the door
   and the other opening it and seeking the Beloved with tearful
   complaint. Throughout the Song there is always this mixture. But, as I
   have said, we cannot expect to find much of this in a nuptial ode.

   Turn, therefore, to the great Book of battle songs, the book of Psalms,
   and here you have in almost every Psalm indications of the complexity
   of the Christian character. So strange are some of the Psalms that it
   has been well said they might have been written rather by two persons
   than by one. David will begin out of the very depths calling unto God
   and then he will end with all the jubilant notes of a conqueror leading
   captivity captive. I shall not have time to refer to many passages, but
   the forty-second Psalm will strike you where the one David seems to be
   reasoning with another David.

   "Why are you cast down, O my Soul? And why are you disquieted within
   me? Hope you in God: for I shall yet praise Him." And the next Psalm is
   much to the same effect. Perhaps, however, the most eminent and
   striking paradox of the whole is the seventy-third Psalm, the
   twenty-second verse, There he says of himself, "So foolish was I and
   ignorant: I was as a beast before You." He could not go further than
   that, surely, in a description of himself. "Nevertheless, I am
   continually with You: You have held me by my right hand. You shall
   guide me with Your counsel and afterward receive me to Glory. Whom have
   I in Heaven but You? And there is none upon earth that I desire beside
   You."

   Heavy as a stone he lies embedded in the mire and yet all of a sudden
   he takes wings to himself and outstrips the eagle's flight as he loses
   himself in the splendor of the Sun of Righteousness, mounting so high
   as to be entirely lost to all but God! David's experience, as we find
   it pictured to us in the Psalms, is but our own, written out in large
   capital letters! And here we see what strange incongruities, what
   marvelous paradoxes are found in men. If we need still further
   instruction upon this matter, let me refer you to the Epistles of our
   Apostle Paul.

   I read in your hearing just now that extraordinary passage in the
   seventh of Romans. How could there have been more graphically described
   than we have there, the war and the contention which is always going on
   between the old nature and the Divine life which God has implanted
   within us? To the like effect is the seventeenth verse of the fifth
   chapter of the Galatians, where he says, "For the flesh lusts against
   the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the
   one to the other: so that you cannot do the things that you would."

   We are carnal and yet spiritual--lost in self yet saved in Christ. We
   are all imperfections and yet perfect-- incomplete in all things and
   yet complete in everything! Strange contradictions, but yet most
   strangely true! Another evidence of this matter is the concurrent
   experience of saved souls. I thought of just taking down at random
   biographies from my library shelves and writing out passages, but I had
   scarcely time for that. In truth you have but to read the truthful life
   of any Christian man and you soon find that he is not all Spirit but
   also flesh--not all renewed nature but still compassed with infirmity.

   We have whole volumes upon this subject. There is "Bunyan's Holy War,"
   describing God's conquest of the town of Mansoul and its subsequent
   attacks by sins lurking within and foes storming without. Sable's book,
   "The Soul's Conflict," contains a mass of experimental knowledge. But
   you will perhaps feel more pleased if I give you, instead of word
   prose, one or two expressions in the form of rhyme which will show you
   that our hymn-writers--they that should be among the more joyous of the
   Christian Church--have been compelled, sometimes, to sing paradoxes
   concerning themselves.

   Ralph Erskine has left us that strange work, "The Believer's Riddle,"
   the greatest riddle that was ever written, a perfect maze to all but
   those who have the clue within. He says--

   "My heart's a mirror, dim and bright, A compound strange of day and
   night, Of dung and diamonds, dross and gold, Of summer's heat and
   winter's cold." Hart, whose hymns come, indeed, from the heart--rightly
   named was he--in his hymn called "The Paradox," says--

   "How strange is the course that a Christian must steer,
   How perplexed is the path he must tread.
   The hope of his happiness rises from fear,
   And his life he receives from the dead.
   His fairest pretensions must wholly be waved,
   And his best resolutions be crossed.
   Nor can he expect to be perfectly sa ved
   Till he finds himself utterly lost.
   When all this is done and his heart is assured,
   Of the total remission of sins
   When his pardon is signed and his peace is procured,
   From that moment his conflict begins."

   We have that hymn of Newton's, which you will find in your Rippon's
   Selection--

   "I would, but cannot sing,
   I would, but cannot pray," and so on. Still more remarkable is that
   hymn--
   "I asked the Lord that I might grow
   In faith and love and every Grace.
   Might more of His salvation know,
   And seek more earnestly His face."

   But I need not repeat it, because you have it in your books.

   You will there find that instead of God's working in the way in which
   he expected, the singer was made to feel the hidden evils of his heart
   and so he was humbled and brought in true penitence nearer to God.
   Cowper thus sings of himself in a hymn which is also in your book--

   "The Lord will happiness Divine
   On contrite hearts bestow.
   Then tell me, gracious God, is mine
   A contrite heart or no?
   I sometimes think myself inclined
   To love You, if I could.
   But often feel another mind,
   Averse to all that's good.
   My best desires are faint and few,
   I gladly would strive for more!
   But, when I cry,
   'My strength renew,'

   Seem weaker than before.

   O make this heart rejoice or ache!

   Decide this doubt for me;

   And, if it is not broken, break,

   And heal it, if it be."

   Thus, if time did not fail us, we might go through all those men who
   have at any time served the Church of God and say of them all that they
   have experienced, felt and confessed a struggle and a conflict between
   what God has implanted and what nature has left in them. Nor do I
   think, dear Friends, that we ought at all to wonder at this. It sounds
   strange in the carnal ear, but we ought not to marvel, for this is only
   according to the analogy of nature. If you look abroad, you will
   discern everywhere contending forces--and out of these contending
   forces the rule of nature comes.

   See yonder orbs--moved by a mysterious impulse they seek to fly off
   into space--but the sun holds them by invisible bands. The bands of the
   sun's attraction would draw them at once into his heat, but on the
   other hand the centrifugal force would drive them far away into distant
   space! Between these two they keep the circular orbit which God has at
   present appointed. So we have a corrupt nature within us which would
   drive us to sin and on the other hand the Divine power within would
   draw us into perfect conformity and union with Christ! Between those
   two forces the Christian life becomes much what it is.

   Observe how in this word death and life are contending together. Death
   crowds his graves, but Life wins the victory. Death may toll the knell
   and this is his note of triumph. But every cry of every new-born infant
   is another shout of the battle of life in which Life still claims to be
   victorious! Look at your own persons and in your own bodies you see
   this duplex action. You breathe, but the same lungs which receive the
   fresh, pure air, give forth the noxious vapor. There is scarcely an
   organ of the body which is without an apparatus for the secretion of an
   injurious substance and its expulsion.

   The brightest eye that ever swam in light casts forth some defilement.
   The skin, if it is healthful, has a part of its functions to throw off
   from us that which would certainly breed disease. There is going on in
   every human body a strange conflict between life and death. And every
   moment our life stands, as it were, in the center of two great armies
   who are contending whether we should be the prey of the worm, or should
   still continue to breathe!

   Do you wonder, therefore, if the whole world of nature is, or has
   fallen into this state that man, the little world, should be the same?
   Wonder or not, certain it is that it is so. And let those who have been
   staggered because they have felt a battle within, from this time forth
   rather rejoice because this is the path which all the people of God
   have trod before!

   II. Now concerning THE ORIGIN OF THIS CONFLICT. There is but a slight
   battle in an unrenewed man. There is a sort of conflict of a minor kind
   between conscience and his grosser passions. Even Ovid could speak of
   this and several heathen writers confess a war within. But there is no
   conflict to any high degree in the ungodly man because, while the armed
   strong man keeps his house, his goods are at peace.

   While there is one master, a man may cheerfully serve him. But in the
   moment of regeneration, a new master comes into the house--a stronger
   than he has come and He will bind the strong man! And after many
   conflicts, He will cast him out forever and get that house to be in his
   own possession. The new nature which God implants in His people is
   directly the opposite of the old one. As the old nature comes of Satan,
   being defiled and depraved by the Fall, so the new nature comes direct
   from Heaven, pure and without spot.

   As the old nature is sin, is essentially sin, so the new nature is
   essentially Divine Grace--it is a living and incorruptible seed which
   lives and abides forever--a seed which cannot sin because it is born of
   God. When these two, therefore, come into conflict, it is as when fire
   and water meet--either the one or the other must die. There can be no
   truce, no parley. The two are deadly foes. The life of the one is the
   death of the other. The strength of the one the weakness of the other.

   Now the old nature has been there beforehand. It is like a tree well
   rooted--it has been there twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, or sixty years
   according to the date of conversion--and it is not easily torn up by
   its roots. Even when Grace comes into the heart and makes sin fall, as
   Dagon did before the ark of God, yet is it true of sin as it was of
   Dagon--the stump is left and there is still enough vitality in that old
   stump to breed pain and confusion without limit. The reigning power of
   sin falls dead the moment a man is converted, but the struggling power
   of sin does not die until the man dies.

   Bunyan said that unbelief had as many lives as a cat and sin has the
   same vitality. Until we are wrapped in our winding-sheets, we shall
   never have that black thread of depravity drawn out from us. It will,
   it must continue to be there till God shall sanctify us--spirit, soul
   and body--and take us Home. Remember how pure the new life is which God
   has given you! It is from God Himself--an emanation from His Spirit as
   pure as Deity! And think how sinful, on the other hand, is your corrupt
   nature! Can it be possible that these two should be at peace? Can two
   walk together except they are agreed?

   Can these two principles, which are entirely opposed to one another, by
   any chance live at peace? It cannot be! And even if it could be, there
   are allies without who will never be quiet! There is Satan, who will
   never rest from stirring up our corruptions. And on the other hand
   there is the Holy Spirit, who will never pause in the putting forth of
   His Divine power till all evil is cast out, root and branch. Since
   these two must fight--the Spirit of God and the spirit of evil--so the
   two principles within which are their children must continue in
   conflict till our dying day.

   Here, then, is the source of this conflict. O my dear Hearers, some of
   you do not know anything about this! Remember, you are in the gall of
   bitterness if you do not. If you are all one way, then you are all the
   wrong way. If there is in you no conflict, it is because there is no
   Divine power there to drive the Evil One out. The more of these wars
   and fights you feel, the more have you cause to thank God and take
   courage! The battle is not yours, but God's. You are not alone in this
   warfare--you shall overcome, as thousands have done before you--through
   the blood of the Lamb!

   III. This brings us to a third reflection. Let us for a moment consider
   THE REALITY OF THIS CONFLICT. The warfare in the Christian mind is not
   a thing of imagination, it is most true and real. If you want proof of
   it you must pass through it. Did you ever kneel down in an agony of
   spirit, resisting some furious temptation from within? Some of us know
   what it is to feel the cold sweat running down our brows when we have
   to fight against ourselves in fearful struggles against black thoughts
   of unbelief.

   Perhaps it may be that the base heart within has even doubted the
   existence of God and dared to prompt us to defy the Deity. And we have
   loathed that thought and hated it so much that our whole spirit was put
   to the utmost stretch of tension in order to win a victory over
   ourselves. You must, if you are at all subject to strong emotions, have
   felt that this struggle was a terrible fact. To you there could be no
   doubt about it, for your whole soul felt it--your heart was like a
   field which is torn up and soaked with blood by the fury of battle.
   There is a frightful reality in this conflict when we remember how some
   Christians fall during it and sin gets the mastery.

   Remember, sin may win a battle, but it cannot win the campaign. What?
   Were there no corruptions in David? What do you think made him sin with
   Bathsheba? Was there no corrupt heart left in Noah when he was naked to
   his shame? Was there no corruption in Lot when he sinned in the cave?
   Why, those black things which have stained the character of these holy
   men throughout all time prove to us how dreadful must be the power of
   sin and how mighty must be the power which keeps sin down!

   Remember what the joy of a Christian is when he feels that he has
   triumphed over sin. Ah, there is something real here! If the daughters
   of Jerusalem praised David when he came back with Goliath's head, so do
   all our powers bless and praise God when he gives us the neck of our
   spiritual enemies. Like the songsters of old, we sing, "O my Soul, you
   have trod down strength." These are no fictions or imaginations of a
   poetic and fevered brain--he that has once been along the road to
   Heaven knows that above all things the traveler has need to be on the
   watch against himself.

   IV. In the fourth place, let us notice THE CHANGES WHICH TAKE PLACE IN
   THIS WARFARE. The conflict in a Christian is not always carried on with
   the same fury. There is always war, but there is not always battle. The
   flesh always hates the Spirit and the Spirit is always the opponent of
   the flesh. But they are not always fighting, and when they fight it is
   not always with the same fury. You ask why? Well, sometimes the flesh
   is not so powerful as at other times. There are moments when, if sin
   were in the Christian's way, the flesh would not choose it.

   I may not be able to tell you exactly why, but certain it is that
   partly from changes of body and also from certain phenomena of mind,
   there are seasons when the propensities to evil, though still as evil,
   are not so vigorous as they were--their strength is awful, but it
   sleeps. The young lion is ever a lion. But its claws are concealed and
   it plays like a lamb. The raging sea is not always in tempest, yet
   tempests sleep in its waves. Perhaps there is more to be dreaded in the
   quietness of our depravity than in the raging of it--for sometimes it
   is the treacherous calm which the Christian ought to fear more than the
   storm.

   Again, it is quite certain that the Spirit's work within us is not
   always equally active. The Spirit of God is always in a Christian--He
   dwells in the Believer as in a temple. "My Spirit will I not utterly
   take from him," is true of every saint. But yet you must know that your
   faith is often weak--that your love is not always like a flame of fire.
   You cannot pray at all times as you wished, Ah, Brethren, we can
   sometimes dash along in service like the chariots of Amminadib, but at
   other times the wheels are taken off and we drag the chariots heavily
   like Pharaoh in the midst of the Red Sea! A change, then, in the flesh,
   or a change in the spirit, may produce a diversity in the present form
   of the conflict.

   It is always there, but not always the same. I suppose that when it is
   most furious the reason of its fury may be sought for in the strength
   of both sides. I do not think that when the flesh is strong and the
   spirit is weak that there is much conflict--then, there is rather a
   speedy defeat. But when the Spirit of God is gloriously at work in our
   souls--when faith is vigorous, when hope is bright, when love is
   flaming, and when, at the same time the corrupt powers put forth all
   their might--then it is that the conflict is stern.

   Some Christians do not enter into this state of strong conflict for two
   reasons--they are men of weak passions and Divine Grace in them is at a
   low ebb. But when a man is endowed with a strong mental nature and the
   Spirit is also vigorous within him, then there will be a contest
   something like the combat of two Samsons fighting and struggling
   together as to who shall get the victory. Ah, Brethren, these things
   may change, as I have said, but the war is never over! Do not any of
   you say, "I shall never be tempted again."

   Gray-headed Brethren, do not think that the old man in you is dead! If
   professors fall into grave sin and dishonor the Church, they are as
   often old men as young men. No, I think I may say that they are more
   often elder men than younger ones. It is sad it should be so, but it is
   so. And there is many a professor who has stood well for forty years,
   but makes a fool of himself at the last. And though he has been honored
   in God's Church, yet he leaves a blot upon his name and the godly say
   in a whisper, "No doubt he was a child of God, but it is best that he
   should be dead, for in his old age he fell into sin."

   No, we shall never be out of gunshot of the devil till we have crossed
   the river of death. Our carnal minds are like a powder magazine--there
   only needs the spark. And ah, what an explosion there would be with any
   of us! May the Lord keep the sparks away. Let us be very vigilant and
   very careful. There is an enemy behind every hedge. There is a foe
   waiting for us at every step. And before this Sunday's hallowed hours
   may be over, you and I may have slipped and have fallen into sin to our
   own perpetual hurt and hindrance, unless almighty Grace shall
   intervene.

   V. A few words now upon THE EFFECTS OF THIS CONFLICT. Some will say,
   "But why does not God remove out of the Christian the old nature?" Some
   uninstructed Christians even think that in conversion the Lord turns
   the old nature into a new one, which is very far from the fact. The old
   nature remains in the Christian. It has received a blow which will
   ultimately be its death, but it still lives and the new nature in the
   Christian comes to struggle with it for the mastery.

   But why is this? Well, we cannot tell you. Such a question reminds us
   of the Negro's enquiry to the minister--"You say that God is Omnipotent
   and therefore He is greater than Satan?" "Yes." Then why does not God
   kill the devil and have done with him?" We believe God to be as morally
   Omnipotent as He is physically Omnipotent. And if He willed it, we do
   not doubt but that evil of every form and shape might disappear out of
   the universe. Why, then, does He permit it? Ah, why? But there we leave
   it. Be amazed at the mystery if you will, but do not question God nor
   cast the blame of sin upon His holy Character.

   There it is, He suffers sin to remain in the universe and after all we
   can say, we observe the fact--but the reason we cannot tell. Still I
   think we may in some respects see how sin is overruled in the
   Christian. Sin remaining in the Believer drives him humbly to confess
   his own nothingness, excludes all boasting from his tongue, compels him
   to trust in his God, takes away from him his propensity to trust in
   himself, leads him to value the precious blood which cleanses him, to
   prize the Holy Spirit who sanctifies him, to rejoice in the
   faithfulness and patience and long-suffering of God who still continues
   to be gracious to him! And oh, what songs will the man of God sing when
   he gets to Heaven!

   How much sweeter will be the music because of the conflict! How much
   more glorious the victory because of the warfare! If I could be totally
   delivered from sin, root and branch, I certainly would. But yet am I
   conscious that no Christian would glorify God so much in Heaven as he
   now does if there were not sin to be contended with. A creature that
   could not sin could scarcely show forth much of the praise of God by
   its holiness. But that the creature can sin, no, that there is a strong
   drawing towards sin and yet the Divine Grace keeps a man from it and
   sanctifies him even to perfection--why this will make the song come
   swelling up of, "Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!"

   If no adversaries had been tolerated, then no victories could have been
   won. If there were no temptations for us to struggle with, then there
   would have been no elbow room for our faith, no power for the display
   of the bare arm of God. Doubtless it is best as it is and when the
   winding up of the chapter comes, perhaps we shall see that our
   committed sins have been made the means of saving us from other sins
   which would have been our ruin. Many Believers would have grown too
   proud to be borne with if some infirmity had not plucked the plume from
   their helmets and made them mourn with brokenness of heart before God.

   God can bring good out of evil by His overruling Grace, while on the
   other hand our good works have often been the greatest curse we have
   ever had. Good works have puffed us up and so have led us into
   pride--while our sins, though pulling us down, have, through almighty
   Grace, led us to make men work for eternity.

   VI. I want your attention to the last point, which is, THE CONCLUSION
   OF IT ALL. This contest--is it forever to continue? Shall we forever
   tremble in the balances? Will there be no valley of decision where our
   souls may take their rest? Yes, Brethren, the fight will soon be over
   and the victory is guaranteed and glorious! Yes, even at the present
   day, the Christian is making progress.

   I do not admire the term "progressive sanctification," for it is
   unwarranted by Scripture. But it is certain that the Christian does
   grow in Grace. And though his conflict may be as severe on the last day
   of his life as in the first moment of conversion, yet he does advance
   in Grace and all his imperfections and his conflicts within cannot
   prove that he has not made progress. Let me show you this. You know
   that at certain periods in your children's history they pass through
   diseases incidental to childhood. Here is your babe of a month old and
   there is your child of three or four years.

   This child of three or four years of age is suffering from some of
   those complaints incidental to infancy. It is not in such good health
   as your child of a month old. It is far weaker and its life seems far
   more in danger. Yet you will not say that there is no progress, for
   this child of three years old has passed through three years of its
   difficulties and hazards, which this little one, newly-born, has yet to
   encounter. We all know that there are certain growing pains which the
   lad feels when he is verging out into his manhood, but these pains do
   not prove a want of strength, but the very reverse--the muscles are
   being braced and the sinews are being strengthened.

   Stand by the seashore when the tide is coming up. There rolled up a big
   wave. Just mark the place in the sand. For the next few minutes there
   is no wave that comes up so high as that--no, some waves that suck back
   the rest and you might even think the sea was retiring! Is there,
   therefore, no progress made? Why, Friend, you will see in a moment, if
   you will but wait! Another great wave will come sweeping up, far
   outstripping the one that we marked just now. And when you shall come
   back in an hour's time and the sea has come to the fullness of its
   strength, you will see that the receding of any one individual wave is
   no mark of its retrogression. You have but to mark the whole sea and
   take time in which to examine it and then you discover there has been
   progress and that progress has been effected by alternate advance and
   retreat.

   Along the coast of Essex the sea is greatly encroaching upon the land
   and every time we go to some of the watering places, we perceive that
   the cliff has fallen, hundreds or thousands of tons have been carried
   away. And yet if you are there at a tide which has gone far out, you
   will often think, "Why, surely the land is gaining on the sea! I never
   walked out so far as this before. I never saw these rocks exposed and
   dry before." Well, it is a strangely low tide. But at the same time ask
   the old fisherman who has lived there all his days and he will tell you
   that his mother was married out in a Church which stood where that ship
   is floating, far out to sea and that all the intervening soil has been
   washed away!

   He recollects when this place, which is now a footpath on the cliffs
   brink, was a quarter of a mile inland--and then you understand that
   though on any one occasion the land may apparently have gained, yet, on
   the whole, there has been a progress in the sea. And so it is with
   spiritual life. There are times when it seems as if sin had gained upon
   you and you were going back in spiritual things. There is cause for
   alarm, but not despair! There is a cause for watchfulness, but not for
   terror--go to the Lord and pray to Him to send a mightier wave of His
   Irresistible Grace--that your soul may be filled with all the fullness
   of God.

   The day is often gloomy at eleven o'clock, but that is no proof that
   you are not getting towards noon. Many a cold wind howls over the days
   of March and April, colder than there might have been at Christmas--but
   that is no proof that you are not getting on to summer. There may come
   a frosty night in May, nipping the flowers, but that is no proof that
   the frost is all coming back again. So you may feel within yourself
   such things as cause you to bow your head in sorrow and to cry out to
   God in grief! But even these things shall but speed you on your way
   towards your desired haven. The battle will certainly end right.

   Just anticipate for a moment the glory of the victory! You shall be
   free from sin one day! You shall be perfect, even as your Father who is
   in Heaven is perfect! You shall wave the palm branch, and wave it the
   more joyously because you had to contend with flesh and blood and with
   spiritual wickedness! You shall join the eternal song and it shall roll
   up to the Throne of God all the more gloriously because you have--

   "To wrestle hard as we do now, With sins and doubts and fears." Come,
   anticipate that triumph and pluck up courage! Go forth, all you
   servants of God, as Barak went against Sisera, and the day shall come
   when your foes shall be swept away! That river of death shall do for
   your enemies what the Kishon did for Jabin--it shall sweep them away
   forever! Standing by the Red Sea of the atoning sacrifice, you shall
   sing unto the Lord who has triumphed gloriously and cast the horse and
   the rider into the depths of the sea.

   I have preached, this morning, especially for the comfort of those who
   are thus exercised and who are saying, "If it is so, why am I thus?"
   You will now see that instead of having cause for distress in all these
   conflicts, you have only a reason to come to Christ again. Come to
   Jesus again! Look up to Him once more and take Him today to be your
   Savior and your All. Put your case into His hands! Trust Him and you
   shall be more than conquerors through Him who loved you. Trust Him!
   Trust Him now and we will meet in Heaven at last to sing His praises
   forever! Amen.

                              An Awful Premonition

   A SERMON DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE,
   NEWINGTON.

   "Assuredly I say unto you, there are some standing here who shall not
   taste of death till they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom."
   Matthew 16:28.

   I must confess that I have frequently read this verse with but a vague
   sense of its profound impressiveness and I have passed it over rapidly
   because I did not understand it clearly. Though well acquainted with
   the usual interpretations, none of them had ever satisfied my mind. It
   seemed to me as if the text had awakened surprise without suggesting a
   simple obvious meaning, and therefore the good commentators had
   invented explanations and offered suggestions widely different one from
   another, but all equally obscure and improbable. Lately, however, in
   reading a volume of sermons by Bishop Horseley, I have met with a view
   altogether new of the passage which I firmly believe to be the correct
   one.

   Though I do not suppose I shall carry the judgment of all of you with
   me, yet I shall do my best to bring out of it that terrible
   denunciation which I believe the Savior has here left on record. With
   His own Cross and passion in view, He was admonishing His disciples to
   steadfastness, appealing to them at any sacrifice to take up their
   cross and follow Him. Then portraying the inestimable value of the soul
   and reflecting on the horror of the soul being lost--a doom, the full
   force of which would be impossible to comprehend until He should come
   in the Glory of His Father, with all His holy angels-- He stopped
   short, looked upon some of the company and said in words like these,
   "There are certain persons standing here who shall never taste of death
   till they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom."

   Now what did He mean by this? Obviously it is either a marvelous
   promise to some who were His disciples, indeed, or else it is a portent
   of woe to others who should die in their sins. How do the popular
   interpretations of our learned expositors look at it? Some say it
   refers to the Transfiguration and it certainly is remarkable that the
   account of the Transfiguration immediately follows this verse both in
   Mark and in Luke, as well as in this record of Matthew. But can you,
   for a moment, bring your minds to believe that Christ was describing
   His Transfiguration when He spoke of "the Son of Man coming in His
   kingdom"?

   Can you see any connection between the Transfiguration and the
   preceding verse, which says, "For the Son of Man shall come in the
   Glory of His Father with His angels. And then He shall reward every man
   according to His works"? We grant you that Christ was in His Glory upon
   Mount Tabor, but He did not there "reward every man according to his
   works," nor is it fair to call that a "coming" of the Son of Man at
   all! He did not "come" on Mount Tabor, for He was on the earth already.
   And it is a misuse of language to construe that into an advent.
   Besides, where would be the occasion for such a solemn
   prefix--"Assuredly I say unto you"?

   Does it not raise expectation merely to cause disappointment if He
   intended no more than this--"There are some standing here who shall see
   Me transfigured"? That scene took place six days afterwards. The next
   verse tells you so, "And after six days Jesus takes Peter, James and
   John, his brother, and brings them up into an high mountain apart."
   Why, the majesty of the prediction which carries our thoughts forward
   to "the last things" in the world's history makes us shrink from
   accepting an immediate fulfillment of it all! I cannot imagine,
   therefore, that the Transfiguration is in the slightest degree referred
   to here--and I do not think that anyone would have thought of such a
   thing unless he had been perplexed and utterly nonplussed for an
   explanation.

   And again--though it seems almost incredible--Dr. Gill endorses this
   view, and moreover says that it also refers to the descent of the Holy
   Spirit. At this I am staggered! How any man can find an analogy with
   Pentecost in the connection here I cannot understand! Pentecost took
   place six months after this event and why Jesus Christ should say,
   "Assuredly I say unto you there are some standing here who will live
   six months," I really cannot comprehend! It seems to me that my Master
   did not waste people's time by talking such platitudes. Who, that reads
   this passage, can think it has any reference to the descent of the Holy
   Spirit?--"For the Son of Man shall come in the Glory of His Father with
   His angels. And then shall He reward every man according to his works."

   Did Christ come at Pentecost in the Glory of His Father? Was there any
   company of angels at Pentecost? Did He then reward every man according
   to his works? Scarcely can the descent of the Holy Spirit, or the
   appearance of cloven tongues, like as of fire, be called the "coming of
   the Son of Man in the Glory of His Father with His angels, to give
   every man according to his works" without a gross misuse of our mother
   tongue, or a strange violation of symbolic imagery. Both these
   constructions, however, which I now mention, have now been given up as
   unsatisfactory by those modern students who have thought most carefully
   upon the subject.

   The third still holds its ground and is currently received, though I
   believe it to be quite as far from the Truth of God as the others. Will
   you carefully read the chapter through at your leisure and see if you
   can find anything about the siege of Jerusalem in it? Yet this is the
   interpretation that finds favor at the present time! Some persons were
   standing there who would be alive when Jerusalem should be destroyed by
   the Romans!! Nothing, surely, could be more foreign to the entire scope
   of our Lord's discourse, or the narrative of the Evangelists. There is
   not the slightest shadow of a reference to the siege of Jerusalem!

   It is the coming of the Son of Man which is here spoken of, "in the
   glory of His Father with His angels, to reward men according to their
   works." Whenever Jesus spoke of the siege of Jerusalem and of its
   coming, he was known to say, "Assuredly I say unto you, this generation
   shall not pass till all these things are fulfilled," but He never
   singled out some few persons and said to them, "Assuredly I say unto
   you, there are some standing here which shall not taste of death till
   the city of Jerusalem is besieged and destroyed."

   If a child were to read this passage I know what he would think it
   meant--he would suppose Jesus Christ was to come and there were some
   standing there who should not taste of death until really and literally
   He did come. This, I believe, is the plain meaning. "Well," says one,
   "I am surprised! Do you think, then, that this refers to the Apostle
   John?" No--by no means. The fable passed current, you know, that John
   was to live till Christ came again. But John himself repudiated it. For
   at the end of his Gospel, he says, "Then went this saying abroad among
   the Brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not
   unto him, He shall not die, but, If I will that he tarry till I come,
   what is that to you?"

   This, you see, was putting a suppositions case and in no sense the
   language of prediction. Now, dear Brethren, if you are so far convinced
   of the unreasonableness of each of these efforts to solve the
   difficulty by feigning a sense, I shall hope to have your minds in
   readiness for that explanation which appears to me to harmonize with
   every requirement. I believe the "coming" here spoken of, is the coming
   of the Son of God to judgment at the last great and terrible assize,
   when He shall judge the righteous and separate the wicked from among
   them. The next question is--"Of whom were the words spoken?"

   Are we warranted in supposing that our Lord intended this sentence as a
   gracious promise, or a kindly expectation that He would kindle in the
   breast of His disciples? I suppose not. To me it appears to have no
   reference whatever to any man who ever had Grace in his soul--such
   language is far more applicable to the ungodly than the wicked. It may
   well have been aimed directly at those followers who should apostatize
   from the faith, grasp at the world, shrink at the Cross, endeavor to
   save their lives but really lose them and barter their souls. At the
   glorious appearing of Christ there are some who will taste death, but
   will they be the righteous? Surely, my dear Friends, when Christ comes,
   the righteous will not die!

   They will be caught up with the Lord in the air. His coming will be the
   signal for the resurrection of all His saints. But mark you, at the
   time of His coming, the men who have been without God and without
   Christ, will begin, for the first time, to "taste of death." They
   passed the first stage of dissolution when the soul quitted the body,
   but they have never known the "taste of death." Till then, they will
   not have known its tremendous bitterness and its awful horror. They
   will never drink of the wormwood and the gall, so as really to "taste
   of death," till the Lord shall come.

   This tasting of death here may be explained and I believe it is to be
   explained by a reference to the second death, which men will not taste
   of till the Lord comes. And what a dreadful sentence that was, when the
   Savior said--perhaps singling out Judas as He spoke--"Assuredly I say
   unto you, there are some standing here who shall never know what that
   dreadful word 'death' means, till the Lord shall come. You think that
   if you save your lives, you escape from death.

   Ah, you do not know what death means! The demise of the body is but a
   prelude to the perdition of the soul. The grave is but the porch of
   death--you will never understand the meaning of that terrible word till
   the Lord comes."

   This can have no reference to the saints, because in the eighth chapter
   of John and the fifty-first verse, you find this passage--"Verily,
   verily, I say unto you, If a man keeps My sayings, he shall never see
   death. Then said the Jews unto Him, Now we know that you have a devil.
   Abraham is dead and the Prophets. And you say, If a man keeps My
   sayings, he shall never taste of death." No righteous man, therefore,
   can ever "taste of death."

   He will fall into that deep oblivious sleep in which the body sees
   corruption. But that is another and a very different thing from the
   bitter cup referred to as tasting of death. When the Holy Spirit wanted
   an expression to set forth what was the equivalent for the Divine
   wrath, what expression was used? "Christ, by the Grace of God, tasted
   death for every man." The expression, "to taste of death," means the
   reception of that true and essential death, which kills both the body
   and the soul in Hell forever. The Savior said then, as He might say, I
   fear, if He stood in this pulpit tonight--"Assuredly I say unto you,
   there are some standing here which shall not taste of death till they
   see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom."

   If this is the meaning and I hold that it is in keeping with the
   context, it explains the verse, sets forth the reason why Christ
   bespoke breathless attention with the word "assuredly," answers both
   the grammar and the rhetoric and is not by any argument that I have
   ever heard of to be repudiated. If this is so, what thrilling
   denunciations are contained in my text! O, may the Holy Spirit deeply
   affect our hearts and cause our souls to thrill with its solemnity!
   What thoughts it stirs up! Compared with the doom which will be
   inflicted upon the ungodly at the coming of Christ, the death of nature
   is nothing.

   We go farther--compared with the doom of the wicked at the coming of
   Christ, even the torments of souls in a separate state are scarcely
   anything. The startling question then comes up--"Are there any sitting
   or standing here who will have to taste of death when the Lord comes?"

   I. THE SINNER'S DEATH IS BUT A FAINT PRESAGE OF THE SINNER'S DOOM AT
   THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN IN HIS GLORY. Let me endeavor to show the
   contrast. We can make but little comparison between the two in point of
   time. Many men meet with their death so suddenly that it can scarcely
   involve any pain to them. They are crushed, perhaps, by machinery. A
   shot sends them to find a grave upon the battlefield, or they may be
   speedily poisoned.

   If they are for hours, or days, or weeks, or months, upon the bed of
   sickness, yet the real work of dying is but short. It is more a weary
   sort of living than an actual sense of dying while hope lingers though
   even in fitful dreams. Dying is but the work of a moment--if it shall
   be said to last for hours, yet the hours are brief. Misery may count
   them long, but oh, with what swift wings do they fly! To die, to fall
   asleep, to suffer--it may be but a pin's prick--and then to have passed
   away from the land of the living to the realm of shades!

   But oh, the doom which is to be brought upon the wicked when Christ
   comes! This is a death which never dies. Here is a heart palpitating
   with eternal misery. Here is an eye never filmed by the kind finger of
   generous forgetfulness. Here will be a body never to be stiffened in
   apathy--never to be laid quietly in the grave--never rid of keen pangs,
   wearing disease and lingering wretchedness! To die, I say, is nature's
   kind release--it brings ease. It comes to a man, for this world, at
   least, a farewell to his woes and griefs.

   But there shall be no ease, no rest, no pause in the destination of
   impenitent souls. "Depart, you cursed," shall ever ring along the
   endless aisles of eternity. The thunderbolt of that tremendous word
   shall follow the sinner in his perpetual flight from the Presence of
   God--from its baleful influence he shall never be able to escape--no,
   never! A million years shall make not so much difference to the
   duration of his agony as a cup of water taken from the sea would to the
   volume of the ocean. No, when millions of years told a million times
   shall have rolled their fiery orbits over his poor tormented head, he
   shall be no nearer to the end than he was at first.

   Talk of Death! I might even paint him as an angel when once I think of
   the terrors of the wrath to come. Soon come, soon gone, is Death. That
   sharp scythe gives but one cut and down falls the flower and withers in
   the heat of the sun. But eternity, eternity, eternity! Who shall
   measure its wounds? Who shall fathom the depths of the gashes? When
   eternity wields the whip, how dreadfully will it fall! When eternity
   grasps the sword, how deep shall be the wounds, how terrible its
   killing!--

   "To linger in eternal pain,
   Yet death forever fly."

   You are afraid of death, Sinner? You are afraid of death? Were you
   wise, you would be ten thousand times ten thousand times more afraid of
   the coming and the judgment of the Son of Man! In point of loss there
   is no comparison. When the sinner dies it is not tasting of death in
   its true sense, for what does he lose? He loses wife and children and
   friends. He loses all his dainty bits and his sweet draughts. Where now
   are his violin and his lute? Where now the merry dance and the joyful
   company? For him no more pleasant landscape nor gliding stream. For him
   no more light of the sun by day, nor light of moon and stars by night.
   He has lost, at one stroke, every comfort and every hope.

   But then the loss, as far as death is concerned, is but a loss of
   earthly things--the loss of temporal and temporary comforts--and he
   might put up with that. It is wretched enough to lose these, but let
   your imagination follow me, faint as is my power to describe the
   everlasting and infinite loss of the man who is found impenitent at the
   last great Judgment Day. What does he lose then? The harps of Heaven
   and the songs. The joys of God's Presence and the light. The jasper sea
   and the gates of pearl. He has lost peace and immortality and the crown
   of life.

   No, he has lost all hope--and when a man has lost that, what remains
   for him? His spirit sinks with a terrible depression, more frightful
   than a maniac ever knew in his wildest moods of grief. His soul sinks
   never to recover itself into the depths of dark despair, where not a
   ray of hope can ever reach him. Lost to God! Lost to Heaven! Lost to
   time! Lost to the preaching of the Gospel! Lost to the invitation of
   mercy! Lost to the prayers of the gracious! Lost to the Mercy Seat!
   Lost to the blood of sprinkling! Lost to all hope of every sort--lost,
   lost, forever! Compared with this loss the losses of death are nothing,
   and well might the Savior say that lost spirits shall not even "taste
   of death" until He shall come and they shall receive their sentence.

   Neither does death bear any comparison with the last judgment in point
   of terror. I do not like to paint the terrors of the deathbed of
   unrepentant men. Some, you know, glide gently into their graves. It is,
   in fact, the mark of the wicked that they have no bands in their
   death--their strength is firm. They are not troubled like other men
   are. Like the sheep they are laid in the grave. A peaceful death is no
   sign of Grace. Some of the worst of men have died with a smile upon
   their countenance to have it changed for one eternal weeping. But there
   are more men of other exquisite sensibility, instructed men, who cannot
   die like brutes--and they have alarms and fears and terrors when they
   are on their deathbeds.

   Many an atheist has cried to God under dying pangs and many an Infidel
   who up to then could brag and speak high things against God, has found
   his cheek turn pale and his throat grow hoarse when he has come there.
   Like the mariner, the boldest man in that great storm reels to and fro
   and staggers like a drunken man and is at his wits' ends--for he finds
   that it is no child's play to die. I try sometimes to picture that hour
   when we shall perhaps be propped up in bed, or lying down with pillows
   round about us, and diligently watched. And as they hush their
   footfalls and gaze anxiously on, there is a whisper that the solemn
   time has come and then there is a grappling of the strong man with the
   stronger than he.

   Oh, what must it be to die without a Savior! To die in the dark without
   a light except the lurid glare of the wrath to come! Horrors there are,
   indeed, around the deathbed of the wicked! But these are hardly
   anything compared with the terrors of the Day of Judgment! When the
   sinner wakes from his bed of dust, the first object he will see will be
   the Great White Throne and the Judge seated upon it--the first sound
   that will greet his ears will be the trumpet sounding--

   "Come to judgment, come to judgment, Come to judgment, Sinner, come."

   He will look up and there will be the Son of Man on His judgment
   throne--the King's officers arranged on either side--the saints on His
   right hand and angels round about. Then the books will be opened. What
   creeping horror will come upon the flesh of the wicked man! He knows
   his turn will arrive in a moment. He stands expecting it. Fear takes
   hold upon him while the eyes of the Judge look him through and through
   and he cries to the rocks to hide him and the mountains to fall upon
   him! Happy would he be now to find a friendly shelter in the grave, but
   the grave has burst its doors and can never be closed upon him again.
   He would even be glad to rush back to his former state in Hell, but he
   cannot!

   The judgment has come, the assize is set--again the trumpet rings--

   "Come to judgment, come to judgment, Come to judgment, come away." And
   then the book is opened and the dread sentence is pronounced. And, to
   use the words of Scripture, "Death and Hell are cast into the lake of
   fire. This is the second death. And whoever was not found written in
   the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire." The man never knew
   what death was before. The first death was but a flea-bite! This is
   death, indeed. The first death he might have looked back upon as a
   dream, compared with this tasting of death now that the Lord has come!

   From what we can gleam darkly from hints of Scripture, the pains of
   death are not at all comparable to the pains of the judgment at the
   second advent. Who will speak in a depreciating manner of the pains of
   death? If we should attempt to do so, we know that our hearts would
   contradict us. In the shades of night, when deep sleep falls upon men,
   you sometimes suddenly awake. You are alarmed. The terror by night has
   come upon you. You expect--you hardly know what it is--but you are half
   afraid that you are about to die. You know how the cold sweat comes
   upon the brow. You may have a good hope through Grace, but the very
   thought of death brings a peculiar pang.

   Or when death has really come in view, some of us have marked with
   terrible grief the sufferings of our dearest friends. We have heard the
   eye-strings break. We have seen the face all pallid and the cheek all
   hollow and sunken. We have sometimes seen how every nerve has become a
   road for the hot feet of pain to travel on and how every vein has been
   a canal of grief. We have marked the pains, and moans, and groans, and
   dying strife that frightens the soul away. These, however, are common
   to man. Not so the pangs which are to be inflicted both on body and
   soul at the coming of the Son of God!

   They are such that I cast a veil over them, fearful of the very
   thought! Let the Master's words suffice--"Fear Him who is able to cast
   both body and soul into Hell; yes, I say unto you, fear Him." Then the
   body in all the parts shall suffer. The members which were once
   instruments of unrighteousness shall now be instruments of suffering.
   And the mind, the major sinner, shall be also the greater sufferer. The
   memory, the judgment, the understanding, the will, the imagination and
   every power and passion of the soul will become a deep lake of anguish.
   But I spare you these things! Oh, spare yourselves! God alone knows
   with what pain I have talking about these horrors!

   Were it not that they must be spoken of, or else I must give my account
   at the Day of Judgment as a faithless servant. Were it not that I speak
   of them in mercy to your souls, poor Sinners, I would gladly forget
   them altogether, seeing that my own soul has a hope in Him who saves
   from the wrath to come. But as long as you will not have mercy upon
   yourselves, we must lay this axe at your root--so long as you will make
   a mockery of sin and set at nothing the terrors of the world to
   come--we must warn you of Hell.

   If it is hard to talk of these things, what must it be to endure them?
   If a dream makes you quiver from head to foot, what must it be to
   endure really and in person, the wrath to come? O Souls, were I to
   speak as I ought, my knees would knock together with trembling! Were
   you to feel as you should, there would not be an unconverted man among
   you who would not cry, "Sir, what must I do to be saved?" I do beseech
   you to remember that death, with all its pangs, is but a drop in a
   bucket compared with the deep, mysterious, fathomless, shoreless sea of
   grief you must endure forever at the coming of the Lord Jesus unless
   you repent!

   Death makes great discoveries. The man thought himself wise, but Death
   draws the curtain and he sees written up in large letters--"You fool!"
   He said he was prudent, for he hoarded up his gold and silver and kept
   the wages of the laborer. But now he finds that he has made a bad
   bargain while the question is propounded to him--"What does it profit
   you, to have gained the world and to have lost your soul?" Death is a
   great revealer of secrets. Many men are not believers at all until they
   die. But Death comes and makes short work with their skepticism. It
   gives but one blow upon the head of doubt and all is done. The man
   believes then, only he believes too late!

   Death gives to the sinner the discovery that there is a God--an angry
   God--and punishment is wrapped up in the wrath to come. But how much
   greater the discoveries that await the Day of Judgment! What will the
   sinner see then? He will see the Man who was crucified sitting upon His
   Throne. He will hear how Satan has been defeated in all his craftiest
   undertakings. Read from those mysterious books, the secrets of all
   hearts shall then be revealed. Then men shall understand how the Lord
   reigned supremely even when Satan roared most loudly--how the mischief
   and the folly of man did but, after all, bring forth the great purposes
   of God.

   All this shall be in the books and the sinner shall stand there
   defeated, terribly defeated, beaten at every point-- baffled, foiled,
   stultified in every act and every purpose by which he thought to do
   well for himself. Yes, and utterly confused in all the hostility and
   all the negligence of his heart towards the living and true God who
   would, and who did rule over him. Too late he will discover the
   preciousness of the blood he despised--the value of the Savior he
   rejected--the glory of the Heaven which he lost and the terror of the
   Hell to which he is sentenced! How wise, how dreadfully wise will he be
   when fully aware of his terrible and eternal destruction! Thus sinners
   shall not taste of death in the real meaning of the term until the Lord
   shall come.

   II. Still further--IN THE STATE OF SEPARATE SPIRITS THEY HAVE NOT FULLY
   TASTED OF DEATH, NOR WILL THEY DO SO UNTIL CHRIST COMES. The moment
   that a man dies, his spirit goes before God. If without Christ, that
   spirit then begins to feel the anger and the wrath of God. It is as
   when a man is taken before a magistrate. He is known to be guilty and
   therefore he is remanded and put in prison till his trial shall come.
   Such is the state of souls apart from the body--they are spirits in
   prison--waiting for the time of their trial.

   There is not, in the sense in which the Romanist teaches it, any
   purgatory! Yet there is a place of waiting for lost spirits which is in
   Scripture called, "Hell," because it is one room in that awful prison,
   in which must dwell forever spirits that die finally impenitent and
   without faith in Christ. But those of our departed countrymen and
   fellow citizens of earth who die without Christ have not yet fully
   tasted of death, nor can they until the advent of the Lord. Just
   consider why not. Their bodies do not suffer. The bodies of the wicked
   are still the prey of the worm--still the atoms are the sport of the
   winds and are traversing their boundless cycles and must do so until
   they are gathered up into the body again, at the trump of the
   archangel--at the voice of God.

   The ungodly know that their present state is to have an end at the
   Judgment, but after the Judgment their state will have no end. It is
   then to go on and on and on, forever and forever, unchanged and
   unchangeable. Now there may be half a hope, an anticipation of some
   change, for change brings some relief. But to the finally damned--upon
   whom the sentence has been pronounced--there is no hope even of a
   change. Forever and forever shall there be the same ceaseless wheel of
   misery!

   The ungodly, too, in their present state, have not as yet been put to
   the shame of a public sentence. They have, as it were, merely been cast
   into prison, the facts being too clear to admit of any doubt as to the
   sentence. And they are their own tormentors, vexing and paining
   themselves with the fear of what is yet to come. They have never yet
   heard that dreadful sentence--"Depart, you cursed, into everlasting
   fire, prepared for the devil and his angels." I was struck, while
   studying this subject, to find how little is said about the pains of
   the lost while they are merely souls and how much is said concerning
   them when the Lord comes.

   You have that one parable of the rich man and Lazarus and there it
   speaks of the soul being already tormented in the flame. But if you
   turn to the thirteenth chapter of Matthew and read the parable of the
   tares, you will find it is at the end of the world that the tares are
   to be cast into the fire. Then comes the parable of the dragnet. It is
   when the dispensation comes to an end that the net is to be dragged to
   shore and then the good are to be put in vessels and the bad cast away.
   And then the Lord says, "The Son of Man shall send forth His angels and
   they shall gather out of His kingdom all things that offend, and them
   which do iniquity. And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there
   shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth."

   That memorable description in Matthew of those of whom He said, "I was
   hungry and you gave me no meat. I was thirsty and you gave me no
   drink," is described as happening when, the "Son of Man shall come in
   His glory and all His holy angels with Him." The Apostle Paul, too,
   tells us plainly in the Epistle to the Thessalonians that the wicked
   are to be destroyed at His coming by the brightness of His power. The
   recompense of the ungodly, like the reward of the righteous, is
   anticipated now--but the full reward of the righteous is to be at His
   coming. They are to reign with Christ. Their fullness of bliss is to be
   given them when the King Himself in His glory shall sit upon His
   Throne. So, too, the wicked have the beginning of their heritage at
   death, but the dread fullness of it is to be hereafter.

   At the present moment, death and Hell are not yet cast into the lake of
   fire. Death is still abroad in the world slaying men. Hell is yet
   loose. The devil is not yet chained, but still does he go about the
   "dry places, seeking rest and finding none." At the last day, at the
   coming of Christ, "death and Hell shall be cast into the lake of fire."
   We do not understand the symbol. But if it means anything, one would
   think it must mean this--that at that day the scattered powers of evil,
   which are to be the tormentors of the wicked, but which have up to now
   been wandering up and down throughout the world, shall all be collected
   together--and then, indeed, shall it be that the wicked shall begin to
   "taste of death" as they have never tasted of it before!

   My soul is bowed down with terror while I speak these words to you! I
   scarcely know how to find suitable words to express the weight of
   thought which is upon me. My dear Hearers, instead of speculating upon
   these matters, let us try to shun the wrath to come. And what can help
   us to do that better than to weigh the warning words of a dear and
   loving Savior when He tells us that at His coming such a gloom shall
   pass upon impenitent souls, that compared with it, even death itself
   shall be as nothing?

   Christians, by the faith of their risen Lord, swallow death in victory.
   But if you die impenitent, you swallow death in ignorance. You do not
   feel its bitterness now. But, oh, that bitter pill has yet to work its
   way and that fierce draught has yet to be drained even to the dregs,
   unless you repent! And now, does not the meditation of these terrors
   prompt A QUESTION. Jesus said--"Assuredly I say unto you, there are
   some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the Son
   of Man coming in His kingdom." Are there any standing or sitting here
   who shall not taste of death till then?

   In that little group addressed by the Savior stood Judas. He had been
   trusted by His Master and he was an Apostle. But after all he was a
   thief and a hypocrite. He, the son of perdition, would not taste of
   death till Christ should come in His kingdom. Is there a Judas here? I
   look into your faces and many of you are members of this Church and
   others of you, I doubt not, are members of other Christian
   Churches--but are you sure that you have made sound work of it? Is your
   religion genuine? Do you wear a mask, or are you an honest man?

   O Sirs, try your own hearts and since you may fail in the trial, ask
   the Lord to search you! For as the Lord my God lives, unless you thus
   search yourselves and find that you are in the right, you may come
   presumptuously to sit at the Lord's Table. Though with a name to live,
   you may be among His people here, but you will have to taste of death
   when the Lord comes. You may deceive us, but you cannot deceive Him!
   The preacher reflects that he himself may be mistaken. That he himself
   may be self-deceived. If it is so, may the Lord open my eyes to know
   the worst of my own state! Will you put up this prayer for yourselves,
   professors? Do not be too bold, you who say you are Christ's--never be
   satisfied till you are quite sure of it. And the best way to be sure is
   to go again just as you went at first and lay hold on eternal life
   through the power of the blessed Spirit and not by any strength of your
   own.

   No doubt, however, there stood in that little throng around the Savior
   some who were careless sinners. He knew that they had been so during
   the whole of His teaching and that they would be so still, and
   therefore they would taste of death at His coming. Are there not some
   careless persons come in here tonight? I mean you who never think about
   religion, who generally look upon Sunday as a day of pleasure, or who
   loll about in your shirtsleeves nearly all the day. You who look upon
   the very name of religion as a bugbear to frighten children with--who
   mock God's servants and despise the very thought of earnestly seeking
   after the Most High.

   Oh, will you, will you be among the number of those who taste of death
   when the Son of Man shall come in His kingdom? Oh, must I ring your
   death knell tonight? Must my warning voice be lost upon you? I beseech
   you to recollect that you must either turn or burn! I beseech you to
   remember this--"Let the wicked forsake his ways and the unrighteous man
   his thoughts. And let him turn unto the Lord and He will have mercy
   upon him. And to our God, for He will abundantly pardon." By the wounds
   of Jesus, Sinner, stop and think! If God's dear Son was slain for human
   sin, how terrible must that sin be! And if Jesus died, how base are you
   if you are disobedient to the doctrine of faith! I pray you, if you
   think of your body, give some thought to your soul! "Why do you spend
   money for that which is not bread? And labor for that which satisfies
   not?" Hearken diligently unto Jehovah's Word and eat of that which is
   good, real, and substantial food. Come to Jesus and your soul shall
   live!

   And there are some here of another class--Bethsaida sinners, Capernaum
   sinners! I mean some of you who constantly occupy these pews and stand
   in yonder area and sit in yonder gallery Sunday after Sunday. The same
   eyes look down on me week after week. The same faces salute me often
   with a smile when Sunday comes and I pass you journeying to this, the
   Tabernacle of your worship. And yet how many of you are still without
   God and without Christ? Have I been unfaithful to you? If I have,
   forgive me and pray to God both for me and for yourselves that we may
   mend our ways.

   But if I have warned you of the wrath to come, why will you choose to
   walk in the path which leads to it? If I have preached to you Christ
   Jesus, how is it that His charms move you not and that the story of His
   great love does not bring you to repentance? O that the Spirit of God
   would come and deal with you, for I cannot! My hammer breaks not your
   flinty hearts, but God's arm can do it and O, may He turn you yet! Of
   all sinners over whom a minister ought to weep, you are the worst--for
   while the careless perish you perish doubly!

   You know your Master's will and yet you do it not. You see Heaven's
   gate set open and yet you will not enter. Your vicious free will ruins
   you! Your base and wicked love of self and sin destroys you! "You will
   not come unto Me that you might have life," said Christ. You are so
   vile that you will not turn even though Jesus should woo you. I pray
   you let the menace of judgment to come contained in my text stir you
   now if you have never been stirred before! May God have pity on you
   even if you will have no pity upon yourselves.

   Perhaps among that company there were some who held the Truth of God,
   but who held it in licentiousness--and there may be such here present.
   You believe in the doctrine of election. So do I. But then you make it
   a cloak for your sin! You hold the doctrine of the perseverance of the
   saints, but you still persevere in your iniquity. Oh, there is no way
   of perishing that I know of worse than perishing by making the
   Doctrines of Grace an excuse for one's sins! The Apostle has well said
   of such that their damnation is just--it is just to any man, but to a
   seven-fold degree is it just to such as you are! I would not have you
   forget the doctrine, nor neglect it, nor despise it--but I do beseech
   you do not prostitute it--do not turn it to the vile purposes of making
   it pander to your own carnal ease.

   Remember, you have no evidence of election except you are holy and you
   have no right to expect you will be saved at the last unless you are
   saved now. A present faith in a present Savior is the test. O that my
   Master would bring some of you to trust Him tonight! The plan of
   salvation is simple--trust Christ and you are saved! Rely upon Him and
   you shall live! This faith is the gift of God, but remember that though
   God gives it, He works in you to will and to do of His own good
   pleasure. God does not believe for you. The Holy Spirit does not
   believe for you--you must believe, or else you will be lost!

   And it is quite consistent with the fact that it is the gift of God, to
   say that it is also the act of man. You must, poor Soul, be led to
   trust the Savior, or into Heaven you can never enter. Is there one here
   who says, "I desire to find the Savior tonight"? Go not to your bed
   until you have sought Him and seek Him with sighs and with tears. I
   think this is a night of Divine Grace. I have preached the Law and the
   terrors of the Lord to you, but it will be a night of Grace to the
   souls of some of you! My Master does but kill you that He may make you
   alive! He does but wound you that He may make you whole!

   I feel a sort of inward whisper in my heart that there are some of you
   who even now have begun your flight from the wrath to come. Where do
   you flee? Fly to Jesus! Hurry, Sinner, hurry! I trust you will find Him
   before you retire to your beds, or if you lie tossing there in doubt
   and fear, then may He manifest Himself to you before the morning light.
   I think I would freely give my eyes if you might but see Christ! And I
   would willingly give my hands if you might but lay hold on Him! Do, I
   beseech you, put not from you this warning, but let it have its proper
   work upon you and lead you to repentance!

   May God save you and may the prayer we have already offered this
   evening be answered, that the company of you may be found among His
   elect at His right hand. To that end let us pray. Our Father, save us
   with Your great salvation. We will say unto God, do not condemn us!
   Deliver us from going down to the pit, for You have found the ransom.
   May we not be among the company that shall taste of death when the Son
   of Man shall come. Hear us, Jesus, through Your blood. God be merciful
   to us sinners. Amen.

                          Barabbas Preferred To Jesus

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, OCTOBER 16, 1864,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now
   Barabbas was a robber."

   John 18:40.

   THE custom of delivering a prisoner upon the day of the Passover was
   intended, no doubt, as an act of grace on the part of the Roman
   authorities towards the Jews. And by the Jews it may have been accepted
   as a significant compliment to their Passover. Since on that day they,
   themselves, were delivered out of the land of Egypt, they may have
   thought it to be most fitting that some imprisoned person should obtain
   his liberty. There was no warrant, however, in Scripture for this--it
   was never commanded by God--and it must have had a very injurious
   effect upon public justice. The ruling authority would discharge a
   criminal, quite irrespective of his crimes or of his
   repentance--letting him loose upon soci-ety--simply and only because a
   certain day must be celebrated in a peculiar manner.

   Since some one prisoner must be delivered on the paschal day, Pilate
   thinks that he has now an opportunity of allowing the Savior to escape
   without at all compromising his character with the authorities of Rome.
   He asks the people which of the two they will prefer, a notorious thief
   then in custody, or the Savior. It is probable that Barabbas had been
   up, till that moment, obnoxious to the crowd. And yet, notwithstanding
   his former unpopularity, the multitude, instigated by the priests,
   forget all his faults and prefer him to the Savior!

   Who Barabbas was, we cannot exactly tell. His name, as you, in a moment
   will understand, even if you have not the slightest acquaintance with
   Hebrew, signifies "his father's son." "Bar" signifying "son," as when
   Peter is called Simon Barjona, son of Jonah. The other part of his
   name, "Abbas," signifying "father"--"Abba" being the word which we use
   in our filial aspirations, "Abba Father." Barabbas, then, is the "son
   of his father," and some mystics think that there is an imputation
   here, that he was particularly and specially a son of Satan. Others
   conjecture that it was an endearing name and was given him because he
   was his father's darling, an indulged child. His father's boy, as we
   say.

   And these writers add that indulged children often turn out to be
   imitators of Barabbas and are the most likely persons to become
   injurious to their country, griefs to their parents and curses to all
   about them. If it is so, taken in connection with the case of Absalom
   and especially of Eli's sons, it is a warning to parents that they err
   not in excessive indulgence of their children.

   Barabbas appears to have committed at least three crimes--he was
   imprisoned for murder, for sedition and for felony--a sorry combination
   of offenses, certainly. We may well pity the sire of such a son. This
   wretch is brought out and set in competition with Christ! The multitude
   are appealed to. Pilate thinks that from the sense of shame they really
   cannot possibly prefer Barabbas. But they are so bloodthirsty against
   the Savior and are so moved by the priests, that with one
   consent--there does not appear to have been a single objecting voice,
   nor one hand held up to the contrary--with a marvelous unanimity of
   vice, they cry, "Not this man, but Barabbas!"

   Though they must have known, since he was a notable well-known
   offender, that Barabbas was a murderer, a felon and a traitor, they
   still preferred him. This fact is very significant. There is more
   teaching in it than at first sight we might imagine. Have we not here,
   first of all, in this act of the deliverance of the sinner and the
   binding of the innocent, a sort of type of that great work which is
   accomplished by the death of our Savior? You and I may fairly take our
   stand by the side of Barabbas. We have robbed God of His Glory! We have
   been seditious traitors against the government of Heaven--if he who
   hates his brother is a murderer, we also have been guilty of that sin.

   Here we stand before the Judgment Seat. The Prince of Life is bound for
   us and we are allowed to go free. The Lord delivers us and acquits us,
   while the Savior, without spot or blemish, or shadow of a fault, is led
   forth to Crucifixion. Two birds were taken in the rite of the cleansing
   of a leper. The one bird was killed and its blood was poured into a
   basin. The other bird was dipped in this blood and then, with its wings
   all crimson, it was set free to fly into the open field.

   The bird slain well pictures the Savior and every soul that has, by
   faith, been dipped in His blood flies upward towards Heaven singing
   sweetly in joyous liberty--owing its life and its liberty entirely to
   Him who was slain!

   It comes to this--Barabbas must die or Christ must die--you, the sinner
   must perish, or Christ Immanuel, the Immaculate, must die. He dies that
   we may be delivered! Oh, have we all a participation in such a
   deliverance today? And though we have been robbers, traitors, and
   murderers, can we rejoice that Christ has delivered us from the curse
   of the Law, having been made a curse for us?

   The transaction has yet another voice. This episode in the Savior's
   history shows that in the judgment of the people, Jesus Christ was a
   greater offender than Barabbas. And, for once, I may venture to say
   that vox populi, (the voice of the people), which in itself was a most
   infamous injustice--if it is read in the light of the imputation of our
   sins to Christ-- was vox Dei, (the voice of God)! Christ, as He stood
   covered with His people's sins, had more sin laid upon Him than that
   which rested upon Barabbas. In Him was no sin--He was altogether
   incapable of becoming a sinner--holy, harmless and undefiled is Christ
   Jesus! But He takes the whole load of His people's guilt upon Himself
   by imputation and as Jehovah looks upon Him, He sees more guilt lying
   upon the Savior than even upon this atrocious sinner, Barabbas.

   Barabbas goes free--innocent--in comparison with the tremendous weight
   which rests upon the Savior. Think, Beloved, then, how low your Lord
   and Master stooped to be thus numbered with the transgressors. Watts
   has put it strongly, but, I think, none too strongly--

   "His honor and His breath Were taken both away, Joined with the wicked
   in His death, And made as vile as they."

   He was so, in the estimation of the people and before the bar of
   justice--for the sins of the whole company of the faithful were made to
   meet upon Him. "The Lord has laid upon Him the iniquity of us all."
   What that iniquity must have been no heart can conceive, much less can
   any tongue tell! Measure it by the griefs He bore and then, if you can
   guess what these were, you can form some idea of what must have been
   the guilt which sunk Him lower before the bar ofjustice than even
   Barabbas himself.

   Oh, what condescension is here! The Just One dies for the unjust! He
   bears the sin of many and makes intercession for the transgressors.
   Yet, again, there seems to me to be a third lesson before I come to
   that which I want to enforce from the text. Our Savior knew that His
   disciples would in all ages be hated by the world far more than outward
   sinners. Full often the world has been more willing to put up with
   murderers, thieves, and drunkards, than with Christians. And it has
   fallen to the lot of some of the best and most holy of men to be so
   slandered and abused that their names have been cast out as evil,
   scarcely worthy to be written in the same list with criminals.

   Now Christ has sanctified these sufferings of His people from the
   slander of their enemies by bearing just such sufferings Himself, so
   that, my Brethren, if you or I should find ourselves charged with
   crimes which we abhor--if our heart should be ready to burst under the
   accumulation of slanderous venom--let us lift up our head and feel that
   in all this we have a Comrade who has true fellowship with us, even the
   Lord Jesus Christ who was rejected when Barabbas was selected! Expect
   no better treatment than your Master! Remember that the disciple is not
   above his Lord. If they have called the Master of the house Beelzebub,
   much more will they call them of His household. And if they prefer the
   murderer to Christ, the day may not be distant when they will prefer
   even a murderer to you.

   These things seem to me to lie upon the surface--I now come to our more
   immediate subject. First, we shall consider the sin as it stands in
   evangelical history. Secondly, we shall observe that this is the sin of
   the whole world. Thirdly, that this sin we ourselves were guilty of
   before conversion. And fourthly, that this is, we fear, the sin of very
   many persons who are here this morning--we shall talk with them and
   expostulate, praying that the Spirit of God may change their hearts and
   lead them to accept the Savior.

   I. A few minutes may be profitably spent in CONSIDERING, THEN, THE SIN
   AS WE FIND IT IN THIS HISTORY. They preferred Barabbas to Christ. The
   sin will be more clearly seen if we remember that the Savior had done
   no ill. No law, either of God or man, had He broken. He might truly
   have used the words of Samuel--"Behold, here I am: witness against me
   before the Lord and before His anointed: whose ox have I taken? Or
   whose ass have I taken? Or whom have I defrauded? Whom have I
   oppressed? Or of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind my eyes?
   And I will restore it to you."

   Out of that whole assembled crowd there was not one who would have had
   the presumption to accuse the Savior of having done him damage. So far
   from this they could but acknowledge that He had only conferred great
   temporal blessings upon them! O ravening multitude, has He not fed you
   when you were hungry? Did He not multiply the loaves and fishes for
   you? Did He not heal your lepers with His touch? Did He not cast out
   devils from your sons and daughters? Raise up you paralytics? Give
   sight to your blind and open the ears of your deaf? For which of these
   good works do you conspire to kill Him?

   Among that assembled multitude there were, doubtless, some who owed to
   Him priceless gifts and yet, though all of them His debtors if they had
   known it, they clamor against Him as though He were the worst trouble
   of their lives--a pest and a pestilence to the place where He dwelt.
   Was it His teaching that they complained of? Where did His teaching
   offend against morality? Where against the best interests of man? If
   you observe the teaching of Christ there was never any like it, even
   judged of by how far it would subserve human welfare. Here was the sum
   and substance of His doctrine, "You shall love the Lord your God with
   all your heart and your neighbor as yourself."

   His precepts were of the mildest form. Did He bid them draw the sword
   and expel the Roman, or ride on in a ruthless career of carnage and
   rapine? Did He stimulate them to let loose their unbridled passions?
   Did He tell them to seek, first of all, their own advantage and not to
   care for their neighbor's needs? No! Every righteous State must own Him
   to be its best pillar, and the commonwealth of manhood must acknowledge
   Him to be its conservator. And yet, for all this, there they are,
   hounded on by their priests, seeking His blood and crying, "Let Him be
   crucified! Let Him be crucified!"

   His whole intent, evidently, was their good. What did He preach for? No
   selfish motive could have been urged. Foxes had holes and the birds of
   the air had nests, but He had not where to lay His head. The charity of
   a few of His disciples kept Him from absolute starvation! Cold
   mountains and the midnight air witnessed the fervor of His lonely
   prayers for the multitudes who now are hating Him. He lived for
   others--they could see this. They could not have observed Him during
   the three years of His ministry without saying, "Never lived there such
   an unselfish soul as this." They must have known, the most of them--and
   the rest might have known, had they enquired ever so little--that He
   had no object whatever in being here on earth except that of seeking
   the good of men.

   For which of these things do they clamor that He may be crucified? For
   which of His good works, for which of His generous words, for which of
   His holy deeds will they fasten His hands to the wood and His feet to
   the tree? With unreasonable hatred, with senseless cruelty they only
   answer to the question of Pilate--"Why, what evil has He done?"-- with,
   "Let Him be crucified! Let Him be crucified!"

   The true reason of their hate, no doubt, lay in the natural hatred of
   all men to perfect goodness. Man feels that the presence of goodness is
   a silent witness against his own sin and therefore he longs to get rid
   of it. To be too holy in the judgment of men is a great crime, for it
   rebukes their sin. If the holy man has not the power of words, his very
   life is one loud witness-bearing for God against the sins of His
   creatures. This inconvenient protesting led the wicked to desire the
   death of the Holy and Just One.

   Besides, the priests were at their backs. It is a sad and lamentable
   thing, but it is often the case that the people are better than their
   religious teachers. At the present moment the laity of the Church of
   England, as a whole, have honest consciences and would have their
   Prayer Book revised tomorrow if their voices could be heard. But their
   clerics care far too little about the Truth of God and are not very
   particular how they swear, or with whom they associate. So long as
   their Church can be kept together, Father Ignatius shall be heard in
   their assemblies, although Christ's call to the Church to purify
   herself, awakens only resentment and ill-will.

   No matter that the throats of certain clergymen were exercised in
   hissing for a moment at the apparition of the bold Anglican monk--he is
   one of themselves, a brother of their own order--and their Church is
   responsible for all that he does. Let them come out and separate
   themselves and then we shall know that they abhor this modern popery.
   But so long as they sit in the same assembly and are members of the
   same Church, the sin is theirs, and we shall not cease to denounce both
   it and them!

   If Evangelical clergymen remain in communion with Papists, now that
   they come out in their full colors, I will cease to say that they
   violate their consciences, but I shall doubt whether they have any
   consciences at all! Brethren, it is still the case that the people are
   better than their teachers. This people would not have crucified Christ
   had not the clergy of the day, the priests, the endowed ministers,
   cried out, "Let Him be crucified!" He was the Dissenter, the heretic,
   schis- matic, the troubler in Israel. He it was who cried aloud against
   the faults of their establishment! He it was who could not be put
   down--the ignorant man from Galilee who would continue to clamor
   against them! The mischief-maker and therefore, "Let Him be crucified!
   Let Him be crucified!" Anything is good enough for the man who talks
   about reform and advocates changes in established rules.

   No doubt bribery also was used in this case. Had not Rabbi Simon paid
   the multitude? Was there not a hope of some feast, after the Passover
   was over, to those who would use their throats against the Savior?
   Beside, there was the multitude going that way. And so if any had
   compassion they held their tongue. Often they say that, "Discretion is
   the better part of valor," and truly there must be many valorous men,
   for they have much of valor's better part, discretion. If they did not
   join in the shout, yet at least they would not disturb the others and
   so there was but one cry, "Away with Him! Away with Him! It is not fit
   that He should live."

   What concentrated scorn there is in this fortieth verse! It is not,
   "this Jesus." They would not foul their mouths with His name, but this
   fellow--"this devil," if you will. To Barabbas they give the respect of
   mentioning his name! But "this"--whom they hate so much--they will not
   even stoop to mention. We have looked, then, at this great sin as it
   stands in history.

   II. But now let us look, in the second place, AT THIS INCIDENT AS
   SETTING FORTH THE SIN WHICH HAS

   BEEN THE GUILT OF THE WORLD IN ALL AGES, AND WHICH IS THE WORLD'S GUILT
   NOW. When the Apostles went forth to preach the Gospel and the Truth of
   God had spread through many countries, there were severe edicts passed
   by the Roman Emperors. Against whom were these edicts framed? Against
   the foul offenders of that day?

   It is well known that the whole Roman Empire was infested with vices
   such as the cheek of modesty would blush to hear named. The first
   chapter of the Epistle to the Romans is a most graphic picture of the
   state of society throughout the entire Roman dominions. When severe
   laws were framed, why were they not proclaimed against these atrocious
   vices? It is scarcely fit that men should go unpunished who are guilty
   of crimes such as the Apostle Paul has mentioned, but I find no edicts
   against these things--I find that they were borne with and scarcely
   mentioned with censure.

   But burning, dragging at the heels of wild horses, the sword,
   imprisonment, tortures of every kind were used against whom, do you
   think? Against the innocent, humble followers of Christ, who, so far
   from defending themselves, were willing to suffer all these things and
   presented themselves like sheep at the shambles, willing to endure the
   butcher's knife! The cry of the world, under the persecutions of
   Imperial Rome, was, "Not Christ, but Sodomites and murderers and
   thieves--we will bear with any of these--but not with Christ! Away with
   His followers from the earth!"

   Then the world changed its tactics. It became nominally Christian and
   Antichrist came forth in all its blasphemous glory. The Pope of Rome
   put on the triple crown and called himself the Vicar of Christ. Then
   came in the abomination of the worship of saints, angels, images and
   pictures. Then came the mass and I know not what, of detestable error.
   And what did the world say? "Popery forever!" Down went every knee and
   every head bowed before the sovereign representative of Peter at Rome!
   The Church of Rome was equal in sin to Barabbas.

   No! I do but compliment Barabbas when I mention him in the same breath
   with many of the popes, for their character was foul and black through
   and through, till even those who superstitiously looked upon them as
   infallible in their office could not defend their personal characters.
   The world chose the harlot of Rome and she who was drunk with the wine
   of her abominations had every eye to gaze upon her with admiration! And
   Christ's Gospel was forgotten--buried in a few old books and almost
   extinguished in darkness.

   Since that day the world has changed its tactics yet again. In many
   parts of the earth Protestantism is openly acknowledged and the Gospel
   is preached, but what then? Then comes in Satan and another Barabbas,
   the Barabbas of mere ceremonialism and mere attendance at a place of
   worship is set up. "Yes, we are orthodox, so orthodox, so sound! Yes,
   we are religious, strictly religious! We attend our meeting house, or
   go to our Church. We are never absent. We attend every form." But you
   have no vital godliness--you have not been born again--you have not
   passed from death unto life! "That is all right! This will do! So long
   as we are as good as our neighbors and keep the outward rite, the
   inward does not matter."

   This which is a foul robbery of God's Glory, this which murders men's
   souls, is the Barabbas of the present age! An outward name to live is
   set up and is received by those who are dead and many of you now
   present are quite easy and content though you have never felt the
   quickening Spirit of God--though you have never been washed in the
   atoning blood--yet you are satisfied because you take a seat in some
   place of worship! You give your guinea, your donation to an hospital,
   or your subscription to a good object, forgetting and not caring to
   remember that all the making clean of the outside of the cup and the
   platter will never avail, unless the inward nature is renewed by the
   Spirit of the living God!

   This is the great Barabbas of the present age and men prefer it before
   the Savior! That this is true--that the world really loves sin better
   than Christ--I think I could prove clearly enough by one simple fact.
   You have observed sometimes Christian men are inconsistent, have you
   not? The inconsistency was nothing very great if you had judged them
   according to ordinary rules of conduct. But you are well aware that a
   worldly man might commit any sin he likes without much censure. But if
   the Christian man commits ever so little, then hands are held up and
   the whole world cries, "Shame!"

   I do NOT want to have that altered! But I do want just to say
   this--"There is Mr. So-and-So, who is known to live a fast, wicked,
   evil life. Well, I do not see that he is universally avoided and
   reprobated, but on the contrary he is tolerated by most and admired by
   some. But suppose a Christian man, a well-known professor, to have
   committed some fault which, compared with this, were not worth
   mentioning--then what is done? "Oh, publish it! Publish it! Have you
   heard what Mr. So-and-So did? Have you heard of this hypocrite's
   transgression?" Well, what was it? You look at it. It is wrong, it is
   very wrong--but compared with what you say about it, it is nothing at
   all.

   The world, therefore shows by the difference between the way in which
   it judges the professedly religious man and that with which it judges
   its own, that it really can tolerate the most abandoned, but cannot
   tolerate the Christian. Of course, the Christian never will be
   altogether free from imperfections. The world's enmity is not against
   the Christian's imperfections evidently, because they will tolerate
   greater imperfections in others! The objection must therefore be
   against the man--against the profession which he has taken up and the
   course which he desires to follow! Watch carefully, Beloved, that you
   give them no opportunity! When you see that the slightest mistake is
   laid hold of and exaggerated, in this you see a clear evidence that the
   world prefers Barabbas to the followers of the Lord Jesus Christ.

   Now the world will change its various modes of dealing, but it will
   never love the Church better than it does now. We do not expect to see
   the world lifted up to become more and more absorbed into the Church,
   The union of the world with the Church was never the object of our
   religion. The object of Christ is to gather to Himself a people from
   among men. It is not the lifting up of all, but the calling out of
   some--the making of men to differ, the manifestation of His special and
   discriminating Grace--the gathering together of a people whom He has
   formed for Himself.

   In this process morality is promoted and men are civilized and
   improved. But this is only indirectly God's object and not His
   immediate end. The immediate end of the Gospel is the salvation of the
   people whom He has ordained unto eternal life and who, therefore, in
   due season are led to believe in Him. The world, to the end of the
   chapter, will be as much at enmity with true Believers as ever it was.
   "You are not of the world, therefore the world hates you." This will be
   as true when Christ shall come as at the present moment. Let us expect
   it! And when we meet with scorn and persecution, let us not be
   surprised as though some strange thing had happened to us.

   III. I come in the third place, and O for some assistance from on high,
   to observe that THE SIN OF PREFERRING

   BARABBAS TO CHRIST WAS THE SIN OF EVERY ONE OF US BEFORE OUR
   CONVERSION. Will you turn over the leaves of your diary, now, dear
   Friends, or fly upon the wings of memory to the hole of the pit where
   you were lifted? Did you not, O you who live close to Christ, did you
   not once despise Him? What company did you like best? Was it not that
   of the frivolous, if not that of the profane?

   When you sat with God's people, their talk was very tedious. If they
   spoke of Divine realities and of experimental subjects, you did not
   understand them, you felt them to be troublesome. I can look back upon
   some whom I know now to be most venerable Believers, whom I thought to
   be a gross nuisance when I heard them talk of the things of God! What
   were our thoughts about? When we had time for thinking, what were our
   favorite themes? Not much did we meditate upon eternity. Not much upon
   Him who came to deliver us from the misery of Hell's torments. Brothers
   and Sisters, His great love with which He loved us was never laid to
   heart by us as it should have been.

   No, if we read the story of the Crucifixion, it had no more effect upon
   our mind than a common tale. We knew not the beauties of Christ! We
   thought of any trifle sooner than of Him. And what were our pleasures?
   When we had what we called a day's enjoyment, where did we seek it? At
   the foot of the Cross? In the service of the Savior? In communion with
   Him? Far from it! The further we could remove from godly associations
   the better pleased we were. Some of us have to confess with shame that
   we were never more in our element than when we were without a
   conscience--when conscience ceased to accuse us and we could plunge
   into sin with riot.

   What was our reading then? Any book sooner than the Bible--and if there
   had lain in our way anything that would have exalted Christ and
   extolled Him in our understandings--we would have put the book away as
   much too dry to please us. Any three-volume heap of nonsense, any light
   literature--no, perhaps, even worse--would have delighted our eyes and
   our heart. But thoughts of His eternal delight towards us--thoughts of
   His matchless passion and His Glory now in Heaven never came across our
   minds, nor would we endure those who would have led us to such
   meditations!

   What were our aspirations then? We were looking after business, aiming
   at growing rich, famous for learning or admired for ability. SELF was
   what we lived for! If we had some regard for others and some desire to
   benefit our race, self was at the bottom of it all. We did not live for
   God--we could not honestly say, as we woke in the morning, "I hope to
   live for God today." At night we could not look back upon the day and
   say, "We have this day served God." He was not in our thoughts! Where
   did we spend our best praise? Did we praise Christ? No! We praised
   cleverness and when it was in association with sin, we praised it none
   the less.

   We admired those who could most fully minister to our own fleshly
   delights and felt the greatest love to those who did us the worst
   injury. Is not this our confession as we review the past? Have I not
   read the very history of your life? I know I have of my own. Alas, for
   those dark days in which our besotted soul went after any evil, but
   would not follow after Christ! It would have been the same today with
   us if almighty Grace had not made the difference. We may as well expect
   the river to cease to run to the sea as expect the natural man to turn
   from the current of his sins! As well might we expect fire to become
   water, or water to become fire as for the unrenewed heart ever to love
   Christ!

   It was mighty Grace which made us seek the Savior. And as we look back
   upon our past lives, it must be with mingled feelings of gratitude for
   the change and of sorrow that we should have been so grossly foolish as
   to have chosen Barabbas and have said of the Savior, "Let Him be
   crucified!"

   IV. And now I shall come to the closing part of the sermon which is
   THAT THERE ARE DOUBTLESS MANY

   HERE WHO THIS DAY PREFER BARABBAS TO OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST. Let me
   first state your case, dear

   Friends. I would describe it honestly, but at the same time so describe
   it that you will see your sin in it. And while I am doing so, my object
   will be to reason with you, and pray the Lord may change your will.

   There are many here, I fear, who prefer sin to Christ. I may say,
   without making a guess I know that there are those here who would long
   ago have been followers of Christ, but that they preferred drunkenness.
   It is not often, it is not every day, it is not even every week--but
   there are occasions when they feel as if they must go into company--and
   as a sure result they return home intoxicated. They are ashamed of
   themselves--they have expressed as much as that. They have even gone so
   far as to pray to God for Divine Grace to overcome their habit. But
   after being the subject of convictions for years, they have up to now
   made no advance.

   It did seem once as if they had conquered it. For a long time there was
   an abstinence from the fault, but they have gone back to their folly.
   They have preferred the bestial degrading vice--did I say bestial? I
   insult the beasts!--for beasts are not guilty of such a vice as this!
   The drunk prefers this degrading vice to Christ Jesus. There stands
   drunkenness, I see it mirrored before me with all its folly, its
   witlessness, its greed and filth. But the man chooses all that, and
   though he has known by head knowledge something concerning the beauty
   and excellency of Christ, he virtually says of Jesus, "Not this man,
   but drunkenness!"

   Then there are other cases where a favorite lust reigns supreme in
   their hearts. The men know the evil of the sin and they have good cause
   to know it. They know also something of the sweetness of religion, for
   they are never happier than when they come up with God's people. And
   they go home sometimes from a solemn sermon, especially if it touches
   their vice, and they feel, "God has spoken to my soul today and I am
   brought to a standstill." But for all that, the temptation comes again
   and they fall as they have fallen before. I am afraid there are some of
   you whom no arguments will ever move. You have become so set on this
   mischief that it will be your eternal ruin.

   But oh, think! How will this look when you are in Hell--"I preferred
   that foul Barabbas of lust to the beauties and perfections of the
   Savior who came into the world to seek and to save that which was
   lost!" And yet this is the case, not of some, but of a great multitude
   who listen to the Gospel and yet prefer sin to its saving power. There
   may be some here, too, of another class, who prefer gain. It has come
   to this--if they become truly the Lord's people, they cannot do in
   trade what they now think their trade requires them to do. If they
   become really and genuinely Believers, they must, of course, become
   honest! But their trade would not pay, they say, if it were conducted
   upon honest principles! Or it is such a trade and there are some few
   such, as ought not to be conducted at all, much less by Christians.

   Here comes the turning point--shall I take the gold, or shall I take
   Christ? True, it is cankered gold, and gold on which a curse must come.
   It is the fool's pence--it may be it is gain that is extorted from the
   miseries of the poor-- money that would not ever stand the light
   because it is not fairly come by. Perhaps it is money that will burn
   its way right through your souls when you get upon your deathbeds. But
   yet men who love the world, say, "No, not Christ, give me a full purse
   and away with Christ."

   Others, less base or less honest, cry, "We know His excellence! We wish
   we could have Him, but we cannot have Him on terms which involve the
   renunciation of our dearly-beloved gain." "Not this Man, but Barabbas."
   Others say, "I would gladly be a Christian, but then I should lose so
   many of my acquaintances and friends. For the matter of what it comes
   to, my friends are not much good to me--they are such friends as are
   fondest when I have most money to spend with them. They are friends who
   praise me most when I am often at the ale-house--when I am seen
   plunging deepest into their vices. I know they do me mischief, but,"
   says the man, "I could not venture to oppose them. One of them has such
   a glib tongue and he can make such telling jokes! I could not bear to
   have him down upon me. And there is another, I have heard him give
   Christians such stinging names and point at their faults in such a
   sarcastic manner--I could not run the gauntlet of his tongue! And
   therefore, though I gladly would be a Christian, yet I will not."

   That is the way you prefer to be a serf, a slave, to the tongue of the
   scorner sooner than be a free man and take up the Cross and follow
   Christ! You prefer, I say, not merely by way of allegory, but as matter
   offact--you prefer Barabbas to the Lord Jesus Christ! I might thus
   multiply instances but the same principle runs through them all. If
   anything whatever keeps you back from giving your heart to the Lord
   Jesus Christ, you are guilty of setting up an opposition candidate to
   Christ in your soul and you are choosing, "not this Man, but Barabbas."

   Let me occupy a few minutes with pleading Christ's cause with you. Why
   is it that you reject Christ? Are you not conscious of the many good
   things which you receive from Him? You would have been dead if it had
   not been for Him! No, worse than that, you would have been in Hell! God
   has sharpened the great axe. Justice, like a stern woodman, stood with
   the axe uplifted, ready to cut you down as a cumberer of the ground. A
   hand was seen stopping the arm of the Avenger and a voice was heard
   saying, "Let it alone, till I dig about it and feed it."

   Who was it that appeared just then in your moment of extremity? It was
   no other than that Christ, of whom you think so little, that you prefer
   drunkenness or vice to Him! You are this day in the House of God
   listening to a discourse which I hope is sent from Him. You might have
   been in Hell--think one moment of that--shut out from hope, enduring in
   body and soul unutterable pangs. That you are not there should make you
   love and bless Him who has said, "Deliver him from going down into the
   pit." Why will you prefer your own gain and self-indulgence to that
   blessed One to whom you owe so much?

   Common gratitude should make you deny yourself something for Him who
   denied Himself so much that He might bless you. Do I hear you say that
   you cannot follow Christ because His precepts are too severe? In what
   respect are they too severe? If you, yourself, were set to judge them,
   what is the point with which you would find fault? They deny you your
   sins? They deny you your miseries! They do not permit you, in fact, to
   ruin yourself. There is no precept of Christ which is not for your good
   and there is nothing which He forbids you which He does not forbid on
   the principle that it would harm you to indulge in it.

   But suppose Christ's precepts to be ever so stern--is it not better
   that you should put up with them than be ruined? The soldier submits
   implicitly to the captain's command because he knows that without
   discipline there can be no victory and the whole army may be cut in
   pieces if there is a want of order. When the sailor has risked his life
   to penetrate through the thick ice of the north, we find him consenting
   to all the orders and regulations of authority and bearing all the
   hardships of the adventure because he is prompted by the desire of
   assisting in a great discovery, or stimulated by a large reward.

   And surely the little self-denials which Christ calls us to will be
   abundantly recompensed by the reward He offers! And when the soul and
   its eternal interests are at stake, we may well put up with these
   temporary inconveniences if we may inherit eternal life! I think I hear
   you say that you would be a Christian, but there is no happiness in it.
   I would not tell you a falsehood on this point. I would speak the truth
   if it were so, but I do solemnly declare that there is more joy in the
   Christian life than there is in any other form of life! If I had to die
   like a dog and there were no hereafter, I would prefer to be a
   Christian! You shall appeal to the very poorest among us--to those who
   are most sick and most despised and they will tell you the same.

   There is not an old country woman shivering in her old ragged red cloak
   over a handful of fire, full of rheumatism, with an empty cupboard and
   an aged body who would change with the very highest and greatest of you
   if she had to give up her religion! No, she would tell you that her
   Redeemer was a greater comfort to her than all the luxuries which could
   be heaped upon the table of Dives. You make a mistake when you dream
   that my Master does not make His disciples blessed. They are a blessed
   people who put their trust in Christ!

   Still, I think I hear you say, "Yes, this is all very well, but still I
   prefer present pleasure." Do you not, in this, talk like a child? No!
   Like a fool! For what is present pleasure? How long does that word
   "present" last? If you could have ten thousand years of merriment I
   might agree with you in a measure, but even there I should have but
   short patience with you, for what would be ten thousand years of sin's
   merriment compared with millions upon millions of years of sin's
   penalty? Why, at the longest, your life will be but very short. Are you
   not conscious that time flies more hurriedly every day? As you grow
   older, do you not seem as if you had lived a shorter time instead of
   longer? Perhaps if you could live to be as old as Jacob, you would say,
   "Few and evil have my days been, for they appear fewer as they grow
   more numerous."

   You know that this life is but a span and is soon over. Look at the
   graveyards! See how they are crowded with green mounds. Remember your
   own companions--how one by one they have passed away. They were as firm
   and strong as you, but they have gone like a shadow that declines. Is
   it worthwhile to have this little space of pleasure and then to lie
   down in eternal pain? I pray you answer this question! Is it worth
   while to choose Barabbas for the sake of the temporary gain he may give
   you and give up Christ and so renounce the eternal treasures ofjoy and
   happiness which are at His right hand forevermore?

   I wish that I could put these questions before you as they ought to be
   put. It needs the earnest seraphic voice of Whitfield, or the pleading
   tongue of Richard Baxter to plead with you! But yet I think I talk to
   rational men. And if it is a matter of arithmetic, it shall need no
   words of mine. I will not ask you to take your life at the longest that
   you expect it to be--at eighty, say--crowd it full of all the pleasures
   you can imagine. Suppose yourself in good health! Dream yourself to be
   without business cares, with all that heart can wish! Go and sit upon
   the throne of Solomon if you will, and yet what will you have to say
   when it is all over? Looking back upon it, can you make more of it than
   Solomon did, when he said, "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity. All is
   vanity and vexation of spirit"?

   When you have cast up that sum, may I ask you to calculate how much you
   will have gained, if, in order to possess this vanity, you have
   renounced eternal happiness and have incurred everlasting woe? Do you
   believe the Bible? You say, "Yes." Well, then, it must be so. Many men
   profess to be Believers in Scripture and yet, when you come to the
   point as to whether they believe in eternal woe and eternal joy, there
   is a kind of something inside which whispers, "That is in the Book--but
   still it is not real, it is not true to us." Make it true to yourselves
   and when you have done it and have clearly proved that you must be in
   happiness or woe--and that you must here either have Barabbas for your
   master, or have Christ for your Lord--then, I say, like sane men, judge
   which is the better choice and may God's mighty Grace give you
   spiritual sanity to make the right choice!

   But this I know, you will never make the right choice unless that
   mighty Spirit who alone leads us to choose the right and reject the
   wrong, shall come upon you and lead you to fly to a Savior's wounds! I
   need not, I think, prolong the service now, but I hope you will prolong
   it at your own houses by thinking of the matter. And may I put the
   question personally to all of you separate--whose are you? On whose
   side are you? There are no neuters. There are no betweenites--you
   either serve Christ or Belial! You are either with the Lord or with His
   enemies! Who is on the Lord's side this day? Who? Who is for Christ and
   for His Cross? For His blood and for His Throne?

   Who, on the other hand, are His foes? As many as are not for Christ are
   numbered with His enemies. Be not so numbered any longer, for the
   Gospel comes to you with an inviting voice--"Believe in the Lord Jesus
   Christ and you shall be saved." God help you to believe and cast
   yourself upon Him now. And if you trust Him, you are saved now and you
   shall be saved forever! Amen.

                              Praying And Waiting

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, OCTOBER 23, 1864 BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the
   Son of God; that you may know that you have eternal life and that you
   may believe on the name of the Son of God. And this is the confidence
   that we have in Him, that, if we ask anything according to His will, He
   hears us: and if we know that He hears us, whatever we ask, we know
   that we have the petitions that we desired of Him." 1 John 5:13-15.

   THE beloved Apostle John here addresses himself to those who have
   believed on the Son of God. And having himself ascended the high hill
   of fellowship with Jesus, he labors to conduct his fellow Believers up
   three glorious ascents of the mount of God. I think I see before me now
   three shining ladders and with the Glory of God reflected from his
   brow, I see John, like an angel of God, conducting the Lord's Jacobs up
   the glittering rounds. The first ascent he would have them take is from
   faith to the full assurance of faith.

   He writes to them as Believers and he says, "These things have I
   written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that you
   may know that you have eternal life." As Believers, they had eternal
   life, for, "He that believes on the Son of God has everlasting life,"
   and shall never come into condemnation. Yes, "He that lives and
   believes in Christ, though he were dead, yet should he live." But it is
   one thing to have eternal life and another thing to know that we have
   eternal life.

   In the third verse of the second chapter of this very Epistle, this
   Apostle draws a distinction between knowing Christ and knowing that we
   know Him, for he writes, "Hereby we do know that we know Him, if we
   keep His Commandments." A man may know Christ in his heart and yet at
   certain seasons, through weakness ofjudgment or stress of temptations,
   he may be cast into doubts as to whether he has any saving knowledge of
   the Lord Jesus at all. But he alone is happy, who, building upon the
   sure foundation of God's promise, gives all diligence to make his
   calling and election sure and enjoys an assured confidence of his
   interest in Christ.

   I know there are some who do not like us to draw any distinction
   between faith and assurance. But the more I think upon the subject the
   more I am compelled to do it--not for the encouragement of
   unbelief--but for the consolation of those weaklings of the flock who,
   upon another ground must be rejected altogether since their trembling
   faith has never, as yet, ripened into assurance. Believers who have
   observed their own experience must have noticed that even when they can
   cast themselves in all simplicity upon Christ Jesus and consequently
   have a right to be confident of their own safety-- yet even then they
   cannot at all times enjoy the comfortable persuasion of security
   because their minds are distracted and Satan has gained an advantage
   over them.

   They trust their God, but it is with something of the spirit of Job
   when he said, "Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him." The shadow
   of the dark thought that perhaps you may prove an apostate darkens your
   path and you cling to the Lord, not with a joyful assurance which can
   say, "He is mine," but with that desperate faith which cries, "I must
   believe, for otherwise there is nothing before me but destruction!" "To
   whom shall I go but unto You, for You have the words of eternal life!"

   Even the strongest of saints must be led, I think, in their experience
   to observe that while always believing they are not always assured.
   This must certainly be the case with the weaker ones and the beginners.
   I know faith is a sureness concerning the Truth of God. I cheerfully
   accept the definition. But I must bid you observe that there is a
   difference between being sure of the Truth of God and being sure that I
   am a partaker of Divine Life. I come to Christ not knowing whether He
   died especially for me, or not. But I trust in Him as the Savior of
   sinners--this is faith. And having trusted in Him I discover that I
   have a particular and special interest in the merit of His blood and in
   the love of His heart--this is rather assurance than faith.

   Although assurance will grow out of faith and that is scarcely faith
   which does not lead to assurance, yet the two are not identical. You
   may believe in Christ and have eternal life and still be in doubt about
   it. You ought not to be, but still you may fall into such a state. The
   Apostle desires that if you believe, you may come to a still higher
   state and may infallibly and joyfully know that you have eternal life.
   O Brethren, do not fear to mount this ladder! The steps are very easy--
   just continue to believe as you have believed! Receive the Word of God
   as it stands--you need no other ground of assurance but that which is
   written there--and the Spirit shall enable you to see your own title,
   sealed and sure. Continue to rest in Jesus and you shall find that in
   Him, as you have attained faith, so in Him you shall also obtain an
   assurance of faith. Here is the first heavenly staircase.

   The Apostle desires to lead the disciples up a second ascent. Observe
   it. "And this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask
   anything according to His will, He hears us." From the assurance of our
   interest in Christ the next step is to a firm belief in the power of
   prayer, in the fact that God does regard your prayer. And this you can
   hardly get unless you have attained to an assurance of your own
   interest in Him. Belief in the prevalence of my prayer, to a great
   extent, must depend upon my conviction of my interest in Christ. For
   instance, here is Paul's argument--"He that spared not His own Son, but
   delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give
   us all things?"

   I must therefore be sure that God has given me Christ. And if He has
   given Christ to me, then I know that He will give me all things. But if
   I have any doubt about Christ's being mine and about my being the
   receiver of God's unspeakable gift in Christ, I cannot reason as the
   Apostle did and I cannot, therefore, have that confidence that my
   prayer is heard. Again, God's fatherhood is another ground of our
   confidence in prayer. "If you, then, being evil, know how to give good
   gifts unto your children, how much more shall your heavenly Father give
   the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?"

   But if I am not clear that God is my Father. If I have not the spirit
   of Adoption, then I cannot come to God with this confidence that He
   will give me my desire. My sonship being assured, I am confident that
   my Father knows what I have need of and will hear me. But my sonship
   being in dispute, my power in prayer vanishes--I cannot hope to
   prevail. Besides, the man who has faith in Christ and knows himself to
   be saved has already received answers to prayer! And answers to prayer
   are some of the best supports to our faith as to the future success of
   our petitions. "Because He has inclined His ear unto me, therefore will
   I call upon Him as long as I live." But if I have no reason to conclude
   that God has heard my prayer for forgiveness--if I am in doubt as to
   whether my first cries have ever reached His ear and obtained an
   answer-- how can I come with confidence?

   No, Brothers and Sisters, seek in the first place, since you have
   believed in Jesus, to get the witness within you that you are born of
   God. Then go from this gracious ascent to the next--knowing and being
   assured that He hears us always because we do the things which are
   pleasing in His sight and plead the name of our Lord Jesus Christ who
   is All in All to us. If you have climbed this second ascent, and I hope
   there are many here who have, the third is not difficult. It is to go
   from your belief that God hears prayer to a conviction that when you
   have prayed you have the petitions that you have desired of Him.

   In other words, to ascend from a solemn conviction of the usefulness of
   prayer to a particular and special belief that in your own case, when
   you have desired anything of God in prayer through Jesus Christ, you
   have obtained the answer! Not that you have had the particular mercy at
   once given into your hands--for there is much that is really ours
   which, nevertheless, is not at present in our sensible possession--and
   yet is truly ours. We have Heaven, but we have it not in enjoyment as
   of yet. And so we may have answers to our prayers and yet, as far as
   our sense is concerned, we may not have received anything. We have it,
   but we see it not. It is ours, but our God sees fit to reserve it for a
   season for a further trial of our faith.

   If a man had nothing more than he could see--there are many of you here
   who have possessions across the sea, or ships far off upon the
   water--and if you had only what you can see just now, your estates
   would be sorely diminished! So we may have the answers to many of our
   prayers--really have the answers--and yet for the present those
   answers, like a ship upon a long voyage, may not yet have returned. Yet
   we have the answer as the merchant has the ship which is as much his
   upon the Atlantic as when it shall lie alongside his wharf. May we,
   dear Friends, obtain the gracious position of knowing that having
   sought the Lord in prayer through Jesus Christ, we have the petitions
   which we desired of Him!

   I want, this morning, as God may help me, to strengthen our dear
   Brethren to look for answers to prayer. Seeing that you have the
   promise of an answer to prayer and that the answer must come to you,
   look for it! Unless you believe that you have the answer in reality,
   you are not likely to watch for its appearance. But if you have come so
   far as to believe that you have the answer, I do now earnestly urge you
   to look for it and rejoice.

   First, let me explain explanation. Secondly, let us say something in
   the praise of this believing in our answer to prayer, commendation.
   Thirdly, let us rebuke some who do not like to have their prayers
   answered--here we have rebuke. And then, fourthly, let us stir you up
   to exercise this gracious privilege which is your undoubted right as
   the children of God--this is exhortation.

   I. EXPLANATION--and let the explanation be taken from instances in Holy
   Writ. Elijah bowed his knee on the top of Carmel and prayed to God for
   rain. For three years there had not been a single drop descending upon
   Israel. He pleads, and having finished his intercession, he says to his
   servant, "Go and look from the top of Carmel towards the sea." He did
   not think it sufficient to have prayed--he believed that he had the
   petition which he desired of God and therefore he sent his servant to
   see. The answer which was brought back was not encouraging. But he said
   to his servant, "Go again seven times," and seven times that servant
   went.

   Elijah does not appear to have staggered in his faith--he believed he
   had the petition and therefore expected soon to see it--since seeing is
   often a blessed reward of believing. He sent his servant till at last
   he brought back the news, "There is a little cloud the size of a man's
   hand." Quite enough for Elijah's faith. He acts upon the belief that he
   has the petition, though not a drop of rain has fallen. He goes down to
   tell Ahab to make ready his chariot that the rain not stop him--in the
   full and firm conviction that as certainly as he had asked--so surely
   would the rain descend!

   David is another case in point. Let me quote but this one expression,
   "In the morning will I direct my prayer unto You and will look up." As
   men take an arrow from the quiver, so David takes his prayer. He fits
   it to the string and bends the bow by vehemence of desire and then he
   takes aim--he directs his prayer to God. He is not shooting to the
   right hand or to the left, but upwards to his God he points his
   polished shaft. Not to those who will afterwards read the Psalm. Not to
   those who are listening to his voice--he directs it to Heaven. And
   having done so, draws the bow with all his strength and away flies the
   arrow.

   Anxious to know how it speeds, he looks up to see whether the Lord
   accepts his desires and continues to look up to see whether a gracious
   answer is returned. This is what I mean by the Christian's knowing he
   has an answer to his petition and waiting and watching till it comes.
   Take the case of Samson, poor, strong, yet weak Samson--as strong in
   faith as he was in body. After his hair had grown again he is brought
   forth to make sport for the Philistines and he prays to God to
   strengthen him but this once.

   Mark how he believed he had the petition--for he said to the man who
   conducted him blindfolded into the Philistine's temple, "Put me near
   the two pillars whereon the house does lean." And why does he seek to
   stand there? Because he believes he has his petition. Having taken up
   his position, he grasps the two pillars and bows himself with all his
   might. Why? Why does he strain himself so? Is it possible that he hopes
   to move those mighty columns from their bases? Yes, it is not only
   possible, but certain that he will work wonders, for he believes that
   he has his petition from his God!

   See how in the strength of his belief he pulls down the temple of Dagon
   about the heads of the worshippers and proves the power of believing
   supplication! Something of that kind of spirit I want Believers to
   experience--to know that their prayer is heard and then to act upon the
   conviction that it is so. Take again, the case of Hannah, a woman of a
   sorrowful spirit. She prayed without an audible voice, only her lips
   moved. As soon as Eli told her that God had heard the prayer, observe
   the change which was worked in her, "Then was her countenance no more
   sad."

   Why, Hannah, why do you smile? You have not yet seen your husband. You
   have no signs that God has visited you and granted the desire of your
   heart! No, but the Man of God has said it and that is enough for her!
   The wrinkles disappear from her brow and the tears from her eyes--you
   ask her why and she says, "I have the petition that I desired of God: I
   asked in faith and the Lord has been pleased to hear my prayer."

   A yet more wonderful instance is that of Jacob, who not only believes
   in the utility of prayer but he will not let the Angel depart till he
   wins His blessing. This was going farther--not only believing that
   there was a blessing and that prayer could get it, but a determination
   not to cease prayer till he had some visible token that he had obtained
   it! Here was strong faith! The case may be exceptional and especially
   when we pray for temporal mercies I do not think we have any right to
   give the Lord such a time and to say we will not rise from our knees
   till the favor is bestowed. That might be presumption rather than
   faith.

   But there are times when mercies are so necessary and when we are so
   clear that our prayer is according to God's will--when the prayer is so
   evidently indicted upon our heart by the Holy Spirit that we may even
   say unto the Covenant Angel, "I will not leave this closet till You
   give me Your answer. I will never cease to pray till You deign to
   smile--I will not let You go unless You bless me." I have to complain
   of myself and I suppose you have to complain in the same manner that so
   much of our prayer is lacking here. We do not send the servant to look
   to the sea. We do not let our countenance grow glad when we have poured
   out our hearts before God--

   "At His feet we groan, yet bring our wants away."

   This is base and wicked of us! O that we had true faith--the real faith
   which would honor God and comfort ourselves by believing that we have
   the petition which we have desired of Him. So much by way of
   explanation.

   II. We come now to COMMENDATION. Let me commend the habit of expecting
   an answer to prayer and looking for it for many reasons. I will but
   give you an outline of them. By this means you put an honor upon God's
   ordinance of prayer. He who prays without expecting to receive a return
   mocks at the Mercy Seat of God. That Mercy Seat was made of gold, of
   pure gold, as if to show its preciousness to all true Believers. And,
   by not expecting to receive anything of God, you in effect despise the
   Throne of Grace.

   Let me ask you, of what use can the Mercy Seat be if God has said,
   "Seek you My face" in vain? If no answers come to supplication, then
   supplication is a vain waste of time! You play with prayer when you do
   not expect an answer! You are not treating it in an earnest, solemn and
   devout manner. You are trifling with it. Little children get their bows
   and shoot their arrows--they care not where, up into the air, to the
   east, or to the west--it is nothing to them. But men in sober fight
   take their aim and watch their arrows. You are but playing with God's
   ordinances of prayer, if, when you pray you are careless about results.

   The truly prayerful man is resolved in his own soul that he must have
   the answer. He feels his need of it! He sees God's promise. His heart
   is stirred to earnestness and he cannot be satisfied to go away without
   some token for good. You would not treat the Mercy Seat as though it
   were a place for boys to play at! You would honor it, would you not?
   You would not be among those of whom the Prophet said, "You have
   snuffed at it," and said, "What a weariness it is." No, but you would
   make the place where God meets with His people glorious. You would take
   your shoes off because it is holy ground. But you cannot do this except
   you believe that prayer has power in it and know that you have the
   petitions which you ask of Him.

   Such a spirit, in the next place, having honored prayer, also honors
   God's attributes. To believe that the Lord will hear my prayer is honor
   to His truthfulness. He has said that He will and I believe that He
   will keep His Word. It is honorable to His power. I believe that He can
   make the Word of His mouth stand fast and steadfast. It is honorable to
   His love. The larger things I ask, the more do I honor the liberality,
   Grace and love of God in asking such great things. It is honorable to
   His wisdom, for if I ask what He has told me to ask and expect Him to
   answer me, I believe that His Word is wise and may safely be kept. If
   you would dishonor every attribute of God, pray with unbelief. But if,
   on the contrary, you would put a crown on the head of Him who has saved
   you and who is the God of your salvation, believe that if you ask He
   will give and if you knock He will open unto you!

   Again, to believe that God hears prayer and to look for an answer is
   truly to reverence God Himself. If I stand side by side with a friend
   and I ask him a favor and when he is about to reply to me I turn away
   and open the door and go to my business, why what an insult is this! It
   is not always considered courteous if you do not answer a person. But
   it is always discourteous if, after having asked a question, you do not
   wait for the answer. If I send a petition to a man's door and then
   having earnestly asked, or pretended to ask earnestly, I am utterly
   careless about the answer, I have not treated the man respectfully. If
   that person should send me a letter in return to my request and I
   should not even take the trouble to open it, how could I provoke him
   worse?

   So you first ask God to grant you a favor and then you do not stop to
   get it. And when He sends it, you receive it as a matter of course and
   do not praise it as a gracious answer to your supplication. Christian
   Brother, let me commend to you the gracious art of believing in the
   success of your prayers--because in this way you will help to insure
   your own success. A beggar knocks at your door. He wants charity. He
   has a firm belief that you will give it to him. The door does not open
   to him the first time--he knows you have seen him and that you
   understand his wants--he therefore knocks again. He is so confident of
   your generosity that he continues waiting at your doorstep.

   You, at first, take little notice of him--you are busy with other
   matters. You come again to the window and you say, "What, is he still
   there?" Perhaps even then you are called away by urgent business and
   you attend to it rather than to him. But coming once more to the door,
   there he stands! "Why, then," you say to him, "you shall have your
   desire." And your hand is in your pocket to give him the relief he
   wants. It is even so with our God. When He sees us wait upon Him He
   will not permit us to wait without receiving the reward.

   "He will strengthen your heart. Wait, I say, on the Lord." Merely to
   knock at Mercy's door without waiting for a reply is but like the
   runaway knocks of idle boys in the street--you cannot expect an answer
   to such prayers! Stand upon your watchtower and--

   "Hear what God the Lord will speak-- For He will speak peace unto His
   people, And to His saints-- But let them not turn again to folly."

   Furthermore, thus to believe in the result of prayer tries and
   manifests faith. Perhaps nine prayers out of ten which we offer might
   have been as well not offered for any good which they have done to us.
   Am I too severe? I mean our hurried morning prayers when business is
   calling us away. I mean our sleepy evening prayers when we are scarcely
   half awake. I mean those formal petitions, (I am not speaking of those
   who use a book, for you can be quite as formal without a book as
   with)--those formal petitions in which you have only expressed godly
   opinions without feeling godly emotions, passed over holy words without
   their really coming from your hearts.

   But, Brethren, when we pray and expect the answer, this is a sure token
   that our prayer has not been a mere formality. Then Faith lays hold
   upon God and she waits. Patience stands by her side, knowing that the
   windows of Heaven, however fast they may be closed, will open soon and
   God's right hand will scatter His liberality upon waiting souls. So
   Faith waits and watches and waits and watches again. This is the reason
   why the glorious doctrine of the Second Advent has such a blessed
   effect on some of God's people. It exercises their faith and brings
   hope into the field.

   And so answers to faith exercises our watching faith and trains our
   hope to look up. The devil says, "Surely God will never hear your
   prayer." You answer, "I have the petition and am waiting till He puts
   it into my hand--it is up there, labeled for me and set aside in the
   treasury for me and I shall have it. I am waiting till the time comes
   when I may safely receive that which is mine even now." So the flesh
   whispers, "It is in vain," but Faith says, "No, prayer is blessed,
   prayer is God's Spirit returning where it came and it will never fail."

   "But how can such a sinner as you are hope to succeed with God,"
   whispers Unbelief? But Faith, like Abraham, considers not its own body,
   though dead, neither the deadness of Sarah's womb, but staggers not at
   the promise through unbelief--it keeps on waiting till it gets its
   reward! Such a habit, moreover, helps to bring out our gratitude to
   God. None sing so sweetly as those who get answers to prayer! Oh, some
   of you would give my Master sweet songs if you did but notice when He
   hears you!

   But perhaps the Lord may drop an answer to your prayer and you merely
   cry, "It is a fortunate circumstance," and God gets no praise for it.
   But if, instead, you had been watching for it and seen it come, you
   would fall on your knees in holy gratitude and say--

   "I love the Lord--He heard my cries, And pitied every groan-- Long as I
   live, when troubles rise, I'll hasten to His Throne."

   Let me add this would make your faith grow, would make your love burn,
   and every Grace would be put in active exercise if, believing in the
   power of prayer, you watched for the answer and when the answer came
   went with a song of praise to the Savior's feet!

   I will not say more, lest by multiplying commendations I rather weaken
   the force of what I say. I could not praise this habit too much. The
   man whom God has taught to pray believingly has all God's treasures at
   his command. You have the privy key of Jehovah's secret cabinet. You
   are rich to all the extents of bliss. You have about you the
   Omnipotence of God for you have power to move the arm that moves the
   world! He who lacks this mercy is but weak and poverty-stricken, but he
   who has gained it is one of the mightiest in God's Israel and will do
   great exploits.

   III. Having thus spoken by way of commendation, we pause awhile and
   turn to speak by way of REBUKE. But it shall be such a gentle rebuke as
   shall not break the head. I am not just now speaking to those who never
   pray at all--let me, however, solemnly remind them that prayerless
   souls are Christ-less souls and will be lost souls before long. Nor am
   I speaking to those of you who merely prattle through a form of
   prayer--I give you but this one word: remember that God will not
   forever be mocked by you and that your prayers are numbered with your
   sins--you do but insult the Majesty of Heaven while you pretend to
   worship Him.

   I am communing this morning with those persons to whom John wrote--you
   who believe on the name of the Son of God. You who believe in the
   efficacy of prayer. How is it that you do not expect an answer? I think
   I hear you say, "One reason is my own unworthiness. How can I think
   that God will hear such prayers as mine? I am fickle as the wind that
   blows and full of infirmities. I am one of the meanest of His sheep. If
   I were one of His ministers I would believe that my prayer was heard.
   But I am the least in Israel and my father's house is all unknown. I do
   serve God sometimes a little, but oh, how little! And even that little
   is marred with selfishness! I am the very worst in the whole family.
   How can I think that my prayer will be heard?"

   Brothers and Sisters, let me remind you that it is not the person who
   prays that commends the prayer to God, but the fervency of the prayer
   in the virtue of the Great Intercessor. Why do you think the Apostle
   wrote these words--"Elijah was a man of like passions with us"? Why was
   that statement made? Why, precisely to meet the case of those who say,
   "My prayer is not heard because I have such-and-such faults." Here is a
   case in point with yours--"Elijah was a man of like passions with us,"
   and yet he prays earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not--so
   that the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man is not prevented
   in its acceptance before high Heaven by the infirmity of the person who
   offers it.

   "Yes," you say, "but, Sir, you do not know the particular state of mind
   I have been in when I have prayed. I am so fluttered and worried and
   vexed and troubled that I cannot expect my prayer, offered in such a
   state of mind, to prevail with God." Did you ever read the
   thirty-fourth Psalm and carefully consider where David was when his
   prayer had such good speed with God? He says, "O magnify the Lord with
   me and let us exalt His name together. I sought the Lord and He heard
   me and delivered me from all my fears." This poor man cried and the
   Lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles.

   Now where do you think David prayed that prayer which God thus heard?
   Read the heading of the Psalm--"A Psalm of David, when he changed his
   behavior before Abimelech, who drove him away and he departed." You
   remember what he did? He played the madman and let his spit run down
   his beard. He acted the fool and was never more a fool, except once,
   than he was then! And yet even then, in his fool's play, God heard his
   prayer! There is something very teaching here. Child of God, though you
   may have gone ever so far astray and played the fool, let not this keep
   you back from the Mercy Seat! It was built on purpose for unworthy
   sinners to come to. You are such. If God only heard you in your good
   times, why then, you would perish!

   The gates of His Grace are open at night as well as at day and
   black-handed saints may come and find mercy as well as those who have
   kept their garments white. Do not, I pray you, get into the ill habit
   of judging that your prayers are not heard because of your failings in
   spirit. "But," says a third, "it is not merely that I do not so much
   doubt the efficacy of prayer on account of myself, but my prayers
   themselves are such poor things! I cannot! I cannot get the groan out
   of my heart before God. I would not ask to pray a happy prayer. If I
   could but pray an utterly wretched prayer. If my heart would but ache I
   would be content, but I cannot get to God. I do not know how to lay
   hold upon Him and wrestle with Him, and therefore I cannot expect to
   prevail."

   Dear Brothers and Sisters, this is your sin as well as your infirmity!
   Be humbled and pray God to make you like the importunate widow, for
   only so will you prevail. But at the same time let me remind you that
   if your prayers are sincere it shall often happen that even their
   weakness shall not destroy them. When Christ was asleep in the ship His
   disciples came to Him and said, "Master, care you not that we perish?"
   And He rebuked them--"O you of little faith, why do you doubt?" But He
   did not refuse to hear their cry for all that! For He rebuked the winds
   and the waves and there was a great calm. He may rebuke the unbelief of
   your prayer and yet in infinite mercy He may exceed His promise!

   There is no promise that He will hear unbelieving prayers. And he who
   wavers must not expect to receive anything-- but the Lord may go beyond
   His Word and give us mercies notwithstanding that fault. And all other
   failings He graciously overlooks and receives our prayers through Jesus
   Christ. Let your sense of the poverty of your prayers lead you to abhor
   your faults--but not to abhor praying. Let it make you long to pray
   better--but never cause you to doubt that if you can, with true
   fervency, come to God through Jesus Christ your Lord, your prevailing
   is not a matter of hope but a matter of certainty--your success is as
   absolutely sure as the laws of Nature.

   Further, I have no doubt many of God's people cannot think their
   prayers will be heard because they have had, as yet, such very few
   manifest replies. I saw the other day a greyhound chasing a hare. The
   moment the hare ran through the hedge out of the greyhound's sight, the
   race was over, for he could not follow where he could not see. The true
   hound hunts by scent--but the greyhound only by sight. Now there are
   some Christians too much like the greyhound. They only follow the Lord
   as far as they can see His manifest mercy. But the true child of God
   hunts by faith and when he cannot see the mercy, he scents it and still
   pursues it till at last he lays hold upon it!

   Why, Man, you say you have had no answers! How do you know that? God
   may have answered you though you have not seen the answer. "I am
   heard," says good Ralph Erskine--

   "I'm heard when answered soon or late, Yes, heard when I no answer get!
   Yes, kindly answered when refused, And treated well when harshly used."

   This is a riddle, but it is a fact. God has not promised to give you
   the particular mercy in kind, but He will give it to you somehow or
   other. If I pay my debts in gold no man can blame me because I do not
   pay them in silver. And if God gives you spiritual mercies in
   abundance, instead of temporal, He has heard your prayer. You may pray,
   like Paul, thrice, that the thorn in the flesh may be taken away from
   you--God's answer is given, and it is, "My Grace is sufficient for
   you." Christ prayed that God might hear Him, He was heard in that He
   feared, but He had not the cup taken from Him.

   No, but He had an angel to comfort and strengthen Him. And this was, in
   Truth, an answer though not such as the prayer seemed to require. You
   have had an answer and if God has heard you but once, pluck up courage
   and go again! Many do not pray expecting an answer because they pray in
   such a sluggish spirit. Begging is a hard trade--a man that succeeds in
   it must throw his heart into it--and so is praying. If you want to win,
   you must pray hard. They called some of the early Christians on the
   Continent, "Beg-hards," because they did pray hard to God. And none can
   prevail but those who pray hard. Slothful souls may not expect an
   answer.

   Then there are so many, again, who pray in a legal spirit. Why do you
   pray? Because it is my duty? Children of God know it is their duty to
   pray, but they pray because they believe in the efficacy of prayer! I
   should not expect God to hear me because the clock struck such and I
   began to pray from a sense of duty. No, I must go, not because the
   clock strikes, but because my heart wants to pray. A child does not cry
   because the time to cry has come, nor does a sick man groan because it
   is the hour of groaning--they cry and groan because they cannot help
   it. When the new-born nature says, "Let us draw near unto God," then is
   the time and the place.

   A legal spirit would prevent our expecting answers to prayer.
   Inconsistencies after prayer and a failure to press our suit will bring
   us to doubt the power of prayer. If we do not plead with God again and
   again, and again, we shall not keep up our faith that God hears us.
   "Oh," says one, "we have no time to pray at that rate." What do you do
   with your time? It caused Domitian to be greatly despised when it was
   reported that he spent hours in killing flies. It was told, to the
   discredit of Artaxerxes, that he spent whole days in making handles for
   knives!

   What shall be thought of us, when we confess that we have no time to
   pray--but there is time for trifles! Princes of the blood royal and yet
   no time to be at court? Kings of a Divine race and yet no time to put
   on your crowns and wear your robes of State? Time to play with toys and
   roll in the dust with the beggars of earth, but no time to sit upon the
   Throne of Glory and to offer the sacrifice of praise unto the Most
   High? Shame on such Christians! May God give us true shame for this and
   from this day forward may we be much in prayer and expect gracious
   answers.

   IV. Alas, this morning time rebukes me, but eternity commends, and
   therefore I shall go on just a few minutes longer and that by way of
   EXHORTATION. Dear Friends, let us believe in God's answering prayer! I
   mean those of us who have believed in Jesus. And because we have God's
   promise for it. Hear what He says, "You shall make your prayer unto Him
   and He shall hear you." Know that the Lord has set apart him that is
   godly for Himself--the Lord will hear when I call upon Him. "He shall
   call upon Me, and I will answer him."

   "Call upon Me in the day of trouble and I will deliver you and you
   shall glorify Me." "It shall come to pass that before they call I will
   answer. And while they are yet speaking, I will hear." "All things
   whatever you shall ask in prayer, believing, you shall receive."
   "Everyone that asks receives. And he that seeks finds. And to him that
   knocks it shall be opened." "Whatever you shall ask in My name, that
   will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son." "If you shall
   ask anything in My name, I will do it." "And whatever we ask we receive
   of Him because we keep His Commandments and do those things that are
   pleasing in His sight."

   How is it possible after this that God should refuse to hear us? Is He
   a God and can He lie? Have we promise upon promise and will He break
   them all? God forbid, Brethren! If there is a God and if this Book is
   His Word, if God is true, prayer must be answered. And let us, on our
   knees, go to the sacred engagement as to a work of real efficacy.
   Again, prayer must be answered because of the Character of God our
   Father. Will He let His children cry and not hear them? He hears the
   young ravens and will He not hear His own people? He is a God of Love.
   Would you let your sick child lie and pine and not go in to answer its
   groanings?

   Will a God of Love close His ears against His people's cries? Do you
   think He will let the tears stream down your cheeks when you are
   petitioning and not put them into His bottle? Oh, remember His loving
   kindness and you cannot, I think, doubt that He hears prayer! A God
   that hears prayer--this is His memorial throughout all generations. Do
   not rob Him of His Character by distrusting Him! Then think of the
   efficacy of the blood of Jesus. When you pray, it is the blood that
   speaks. Every drop of Jesus' blood cries, "Father, hear him! Father,
   hear him! Hear the sinner's cry!" That blood was sprinkled on the Mercy
   Seat that the Mercy Seat might be an efficacious Mercy Seat for you! Do
   not doubt the blood of Christ!

   What? Can He die and yet that blood have no more efficacy in it than
   the blood of bulls or of goats? You will not think this. Then do not
   doubt that prayer prevails! Think, again, that Jesus pleads. He points
   to the wound upon His breast and spreads His pierced hands. Shall the
   Father deny the Son? Shall prayers offered by Christ be cast out from
   Heaven's register? Oh, these things must not--cannot be! Besides, the
   Holy Spirit Himself is the Author of your prayers. Will God incite the
   desire and then not hear it? Shall there be a schism between the Father
   and the Holy Spirit? You will not dream of such a thing!

   Oh, believe me when I review my own personal experience during the
   fifteen years that I have known something of the Savior! It leads me to
   feel that it is as certain that God hears prayer as that twice two make
   four! As certain as that the rock, falling by the law of gravitation,
   seeks the earth. We have not the time to give instances in proof but I
   hope your own experience furnishes them. May I beseech you by the love
   you bear to Jesus, do Him the honor of believing in the prevalence of
   His plea! By the light and life you have received of the Holy Spirit,
   do not discredit Him by thinking He can teach you to pray a prayer that
   will not be accepted before God!

   Let us as a Church pray more. O that the Spirit of prayer would come
   down upon us! Let us expect greater blessings! I was led forth in
   prayer this morning beyond the usual limits. I do not know how the time
   fled, but I do know that we have the petitions. Let us stand on our
   watchtower and look. Let us meet again and again at special meetings
   and let us cry mightily unto the Most High, pouring out our hearts like
   water before Him and He will open the windows of Heaven and give us
   greater blessings than we have ever had before--great as those already
   received have been!

   This very afternoon let the season of prayer begin and let it be well
   sustained. It is to Believers that these words are spoken. May God lead
   you who are not Believers to trust in Jesus. Amen.

                            Preparation for Revival

   A Sermon

   (No. 597)

   Delivered on Sunday October 30th, 1864 by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "Can two walk together, except they be agreed?"--Amos 3:3.

   THE BELIEVER IS AGREED with God. The war between the most holy God and
   his offending creatures is over in the case of bloodwashed sinners; not
   suspended by a truce, but ended for ever by a peace which passeth all
   understanding. The believer is fully agreed with God concerning the
   divine law: he confesses that "the law is holy, and just, and good": he
   would not have it altered if he could. He rejoices in the way of God's
   testimonies more than in all riches; yea, in his precepts doth he take
   delight, praying evermore, "O let me not wander from thy commandments."
   He joyfully acknowledges that the Judge of all the earth rules mankind
   by a law in which there is no injustice, by statutes which subserve the
   best interests of the governed, while they secure the glory of the
   great Governor. The Christian "consents unto the law that it is good."
   He is agreed with God, moreover, that a breach of the law should be
   visited with penalty: he would be unwilling that sin should go
   unpunished. He feels that the sanctions of law, however terrible, are
   absolutely necessary, and required to be severe. Above all, he is
   agreed with God in that great atonement for sin which God himself has
   ordained and provided in the person of Jesus Christ. Gazing upon the
   matchless sacrifice of Calvary, while the Lord is content, the believer
   is satisfied; where God finds satisfaction for his injured honour, the
   believer finds the noblest object of admiration and adoration. Thou
   lovest Golgotha, O thou Judge of the earth; and thy people are
   perfectly agreed with thee in this. Henceforth the Christian is at one
   with God in his love of holiness: he delights in the law of God after
   the inward man. Sin, which is abhorrent to the Most High, is obnoxious
   to the Christian in that measure in which he is enlightened and
   conformed unto the image of Christ. Great God, thou hast unsheathed thy
   sword, and bathed it in heaven, for the destruction of all evil, and
   thy redeemed are on thy side, abhorring that which is evil, and
   resolving to fight under thy command till the last sin shall be cut
   off. Thou hast uplifted thy banner because of the truth, and around thy
   standard the soldiers of the cross are rallying; for thy battle, O Most
   High, is the battle of the Church; thy foes are our foes, and thy
   friends are the excellent of the earth, in whom is all our delight.

   I trust that most of us who are here met in the name of Jesus, feel a
   deep, sincere, and constant agreement with God. We have been guilty of
   murmuring at his will; but yet our newborn nature evermore at its core
   and center knoweth that the will of the Lord is wise and good; and we
   therefore bow our heads with reverent agreement, and say, "Not as I
   will, but as thou wilt." "The will of the Lord be done." Our soul, when
   through infirmity she is tempted to rebellion, nevertheless struggles
   after complete resignation of her wishes and desires to the will of the
   Most High. We do not covet the life of self-will, but we sigh after the
   spirit of self-denial; yea, of self-annihilation, that Christ may live
   in us, and that the old Ego, the carnal I, may be altogether slain. I
   would be as obedient to my God as are those firstborn sons of light,
   his messengers of flaming fire. As the mercury feels the mysterious
   changes of the air, and sensitively moves in accordance with the
   atmosphere, so would I being surrounded by my God, evermore perceive
   his wish and will, and move at once in obedience thereto. Our strength
   shall be perfect when we have no independent will, but move and act
   only as we are moved and acted on by our gracious God. I hope that at
   this hour we can truly say, that notwithstanding our many sins, we do
   love the Lord our God; and if we could have our will this morning, we
   would follow his commands without the slightest departure from the
   narrow path. We are in heart agreed with God.

   The text reminds us that this agreement gives us power to walk with
   God. May we be enabled to claim this privilege which divine grace has
   bestowed on us: power to walk with God in daily, habitual, friendly,
   intimate, joyous communion. Believer, you can walk with God this very
   day. He is as near to thee as he was to Abraham beneath the oak at
   Mamre, or Moses at the back of the desert. He is as willing to show
   thee his love as he was to reveal himself to Daniel on the banks of
   Ulai, or to Ezekiel by the streams of Chebar. Thou hast no greater
   distance this day between thee and thy God, than Jacob had when he laid
   hold upon the angel and prevailed. He is thy father, as truly as he was
   the father of the people whom he covered by day with a cloud, and
   cheered by night with a pillar of fire; and though no Shekinah lights
   up a golden mercy-seat, yet the throne of grace is quite as glorious
   and even more accessible than in the days of old. He shall hide thee in
   his pavilion, as he did his servant David; yea, in the secret of the
   tabernacle shall be thy hiding-place. Enoch's privilege was not
   peculiar to him; it is thy birthright: claim it. Noah's high honour of
   walking with God was not reserved for him alone; it belongs to thee
   also, shut in as thou art in the ark of the covenant, and saved from
   the deluge of divine wrath. It should be the Christian's delight to be
   always with his God; walking with him in unbroken fellowship. Enoch did
   not take a turn or two with God, as Matthew Henry observes, but he
   walked with him four hundred years. O that we might cease to be with
   our God as wayfaring men who tarry but for a night: may we dwell in
   God, and may he dwell in us. Walking implies action; and our actions
   should always be in the Lord. The Christian, whatsoever he eateth, or
   drinketh, or doeth, should do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving
   thanks unto God and the Father by him. Walking has in it the thought of
   progress; but all our progress should be with God. As we are rooted and
   grounded in Christ, so we must ask to grow up in him; ever abiding in
   our highest moments with God, and never imagining or conceiving any
   progress which shall remove us from humble confidence in him. Beloved
   brother in the Lord, it may be that thy heart is agreed with God, and
   yet thou hast lost for a time thy walking with him; be not at ease in
   thy soul till thou hast regained it. Search thine own heart by the
   light of the Word and of the Holy Spirit; and when thou knowest thyself
   to be agreed with God, through Him who is our peace, hesitate not to
   draw near with holy confidence to thy Father and thy God,
   notwithstanding all thy past wanderings; for he welcomes thee to walk
   with him, seeing that thou art agreed.

   At this season we, as a Church, have had our hearts set upon a revival
   of religion in our midst. Many of us will be greatly and grievously
   disappointed if such a revival shall not take place. We have felt moved
   to cry for it; I think I may say we have been almost unanimously thus
   moved. Already there are signs that God is visiting us in a very
   remarkable manner, but our souls are set upon a greater work than we
   have ever seen. Now, dear friends, we need as the first and most
   essential thing in this matter, that God should walk with us. In vain
   we shall struggle after revival unless we have his presence. If, then,
   we desire to have his presence with us, we must see to it that we are
   perfectly agreed with him both in the design of the work, and in the
   method of it; and I desire this morning to stir up your pure minds to
   heart-searching and vigilant self-examination, that every false way may
   be purged from us, since God will not walk with us as a Church, unless
   we be agreed with him.

   The first remark, then, of this morning, is simply this,--we desire in
   this matter to walk together with God; but, in the second place, if we
   would have him with us we must be agreed with him; and therefore,
   thirdly, we desire to purge ourselves of everything which would mar our
   perfect agreement with God, and so prevent his coming to our aid. I do
   ask the prayers of God's people that he may enable me to speak to
   profit this morning, for if ever I felt my own unfitness to edify the
   saints, I do so just now: I will even confess that if I could have had
   my own choice, I should have left it to some one else to address you
   this morning. My harp is out of tune, and the strings are all loosened,
   but the chief musician understands his instruments, and knows how to
   get music out of us, and in answer to prayer he will doubtless sustain
   us and give you a blessing.

   I. Let us, first, AVOW OUR DESIRE THAT IN OUR PRESENT EFFORT WE MAY
   WALK WITH GOD; otherwise our strivings after revival will be very
   wearisome.

   I know of nothing more saddening than to attend a prayer-meeting where
   the devotion is forced, and the fervour laborious; where brethren puff
   and strain like engines with a load behind them too heavy for them to
   drag. It is painful to detect an evident design to get up an
   excitement, and wind up the people to the proper pitch; when the
   addresses are adapted to foster hotheadedness, and the prayers to beget
   superstition. God's true saints cannot but feel that to gain the graces
   of the Spirit by fleshly vehemence is sad work. They retire from such a
   meeting, and they say, "How different is this from occasions when God's
   Spirit has been really at work with us!" Then, like a ship with her
   sails filled with a fair wind, floating majestically along without
   tugging and straining, the Church, borne onward with the breath of the
   divine Spirit, with a full tide of heaven's grace, speeds on her
   glorious way. "If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence,"
   was the request of Moses; and I think we may rather deprecate than
   desire a revival if God's presence be not in it. Lord, let us stay as
   we are, crying and groaning to see better days, rather than permit us
   to be puffed up with the notion of revival without thine own power in
   it; let us have no special prayer-meetings merely for the sake of them;
   but let us, O let us receive special blessings as the result of prayer:
   if thou dost not intend to help us now let us weep in secret, but let
   us not rejoice in a mere name if the substance be lacking. During a
   course of meetings by which we desire to excite the hearts of believers
   to a deeper interest in spiritual things; if there be not a gracious
   power in them, you will soon perceive a dulness, a flagging, a
   heaviness, a weariness stealing over the assembly; the numbers will
   decline, the prayers will become less fervent, and the whole thing will
   degenerate into a hollow sham or a mournful monotony. To come up from
   the wilderness is hard climbing unless we lean on our beloved. O thou
   who art our beloved and adorable Lord, lest our souls grow weary in
   well-doing, and faint for heaviness, be pleased to let us enjoy
   communion with thyself.

   Not only is there weariness in our own attempts, but they always end in
   disappointment, unless God walketh with us. Ye may pray, and pray, and
   pray, but there shall be no conversions, no sense of quickening, until
   the Spirit's working be distinctly recognized. The minister shall be
   just as much a preacher of the mere letter as ever he was; the Church
   officers shall be as formal and official as ever they were; the Church
   members shall be as inconsistent and as indifferent as they were wont
   to be; the congregation shall be as uninterested and as unmoved as they
   were in the worst times, except the Spirit of God work with us. In this
   thing we may quote the words of the psalmist, "Except the Lord build
   the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the Lord keep the
   city, the watchman waketh but in vain. It is vain for you to rise up
   early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth
   his beloved sleep." O friends, it is well to have a holy industry and a
   devout perseverance; it is well to strain every nerve, and put forth
   every effort; but all this must end in the most sorry, heart-sickening
   failure, unless the Lord rend the heavens and come down. I am telling
   you what you all do know, and what I trust you feel, but it is what we
   are constantly forgetting; for many are they that go a warfare at their
   own charges, and so become both bankrupt and defeated; and many be they
   who would build God's house simply by stress of human effort, but they
   fail, because God is not there to give them success.

   Yet more; supposing that in this our attempt at revival, we should not
   be favoured with the presence of God; then prayer will be greatly
   dishonoured. I take it, that when a Church draws near to God in special
   prayer, asking any mercy, if she does not receive that mercy on account
   of some disagreement with God, then her belief in prayer is, for the
   future, greatly weakened; and this is a most serious evil, for it
   loosens the girdle of the loins of God's saints. Anything which makes
   men doubt the efficacy of prayer, is an injury to their spirituality;
   and thus upon the largest scale God's Church will suffer loss if her
   prayers shall remain unanswered. We must go on; it would be ruin to
   forbear or to turn our backs. As a Church, we must now conquer or die.
   How can I again stir you up to supplication, if on this occasion your
   prayers should be in vain? I shall come into this pulpit with but a
   faint heart to speak of my Master's faithfulness if he does not give
   you evidences of it. Ah! my brethren, when you are lifting up your
   voices in intercession, I cannot expect to mark your earnestness nor to
   behold your faith, unless that faith shall be confirmed just now by a
   shower of divine mercy. To the world at large the non-hearing of prayer
   would be a ready argument, either against the existence of God, or else
   against the reality of his promise. I hope such a thing as this will
   not occur. "Aha! aha!" saith the enemy, "see what has come of it all!
   The people cried, but they cried in vain. They met in large numbers;
   they approached the mercy-seat with tears and groans, but no result has
   come of it; there have been no more conversions than before, and God's
   strength has not been put forth." Would you desire that such a calamity
   as this should occur. The true soldiers of the cross in our Israel
   would almost as soon lay down their necks, as that God's honour should
   thus be attainted in the presence of his foes.

   Moreover, every attempt at revival of religion which proves a
   failure,--and fail it must without the presence of God,--leaves the
   Church in a worse condition than it was before; because, if it should
   prove a failure, from the want of any stir at all; then God's people
   fall back into their former lethargy, with an excuse for continuing in
   it; or if a false stir be made, a reaction follows of a most injurious
   character. I suppose the worst time in the Christian Church is
   generally that which follows the excitement of a revival; and if that
   revival has had no reality in it, the mischief which is done is awful
   and incalulable. If no excitement shall come at all, the mischief is
   still as great; God's people, being disappointed, have little heart to
   listen to further exhortations to future zealous action, become
   contented with their Laodicean lukewarmness, and it becomes impossible
   to bestir them again. If a revival should apparently have success and
   yet God be not in it, perhaps this is even worse. The wild-fire and
   madness of some revivals have been a perfect disgrace to the common
   sense of the age, let alone the spirituality of the Church. I know, and
   speak not without book, when I declare that some churches have been
   seriously deteriorated and permanently injured by large admissions of
   excited but unconverted persons; so that the only thing a fresh pastor
   could do was to begin afresh, and purge the church book throughout,
   sweeping off scores of carnal persons; the beginning anew being almost
   hopeless, because, after the paroxysm of passion about religion has
   passed, there follows a season in which religion is treated with
   indifference, if not with disdain. I had rather see a Church asleep,
   than see it awake into the fever of fanaticism: better that she should
   lie still than do mischief. O dear friends, we have felt in our souls,
   not that we may have revival, but that we must have it; and when we
   think of the incalculable damage that shall be done to us all if the
   Lord does not visit us, I am sure we must again draw near to the angel
   and wrestle afresh, with this determination, that we will not let him
   go unless he bless us.

   We may be confirmed in our anxious desire to have the Lord walking with
   us in this thing, when we consider the blessings which are sure to flow
   from his presence. Ah! what holy quickening shall come upon every one
   of us. The preacher will not have to lament that he has so little power
   in prayer; both alone and in your presence he shall be strengthened to
   intercede as an angel of God. You shall not have to mourn that the
   service lacks its former sweetness. You will feel the blessedness you
   knew when first you saw the Lord. You will not have to mourn that you
   are cold and dead, that your songs languish, and that your prayers
   expire; instead thereof, every action shall be fraught with vigour,
   every thought shall glow with earnestness, every word shall be clothed
   with divine power. Let God arise; and doubts and fears shall betake
   themselves to their hiding-places, as the bats conceal themselves at
   the rising of the dawn. Let the Lord visit you; and difficulties which
   frown like Alps, will sink to plains. Let him arise; and all your
   enemies shall flee before you, as the smoke before the wind; the
   heavens shall drop with showers of mercy; and even your sins and all
   the guilt thereof, shall shake as Sinai shook at the presence of the
   God of Israel. A Church with God's presence in it is holy, happy,
   united, earnest, laborious, successful; fair as the moon before the
   Lord, and clear as the sun in the eyes of men, she is terrible as an
   army with banners to her enemies.

   If God shall be pleased to be with his Church, then direct good shall
   visit our congregation. We used to say at Park Street, that there were
   not many seat-holders unconverted. The like is to a great extent true
   here. The immense increase of our Church gives us the hope that the day
   will come when there will not be a single seat unoccupied by a
   believer: but it is not the case yet. I suppose the Church is about
   half the congregation now. There are some, however, that from the very
   first have listened; but so far as salvation is concerned, they have
   listened in vain: they have been moved to tears, they have made good
   resolutions; but after ten or eleven years of ministry, they are just
   where they were, except that they have accumulated fresh guilt. Some
   desire to be Christians, but they harbour some darling lust. We know
   some who used to feel under the Word, but do not feel now. The voice
   which once was like a trumpet, now lulls them to sleep. Some have made
   a compromise; and one day they will serve God and another day they will
   serve their sins; like the Samaritans who feared the Lord and served
   other gods. Now let our cries be heard for the Master's presence, and
   we shall soon see these brought in; hearts of stone shall be turned to
   flesh; the iron of the Word shall break the northern iron and steel;
   Jehovah Jesus shall ride victoriously through those gates which have
   been barred against him, and there shall be shouting in heaven because
   the Lord hath gotten him the victory.

   Wider blessings will follow. A Church is never blessed alone. If any
   one Church shall stand in the vigour of piety, other Churches shall
   take example therefrom, and make an advance towards a better state.
   Here we have around us many Churches, hills which God has blessed; but
   they, like ourselves, have a tendency to slumber. Let God pour out his
   Spirit here, and the shower will not be confined to these fields, but
   will drop upon other pastures, and they shall rejoice on every side.
   Our testimony for God rings through this land; from one end of it to
   the other. Our ministry is not hidden under a bushel nor confined to a
   few. Tens of thousands listen every week to our word; and if the Lord
   shall be pleased to bless it, then shall it be as ointment poured
   forth, to load the moral atmosphere with a savour of Christ crucified.
   One nation cannot feel the power of God without communicating some of
   its blessing to another. The Atlantic cannot divide: no tongue or
   language can separate us. If God bless France or Switzerland, the
   influence shall be felt upon the Continent; if he should bless our
   island, all the whole earth must feel the power thereof. Therefore do
   we feel encouraged mightily to pray. O, my brethren, the world grows
   old; man's faith is getting weary of long waiting; the false prophets
   begin again to appear, and cry lo here, and lo there; but the Lord must
   come; of this are we confident: in such an hour as we think not, he may
   appear. How would we have him find us at his coming? Would we have him
   find his servants sleeping? his stewards wasting his goods? his
   vinedressers with neglected vines? his soldiers with swords rusted into
   their scabbards? No, we would have him find us watching, standing upon
   the watch-tower, feeding his sheep, tending his lambs, succouring the
   needy, comforting the weary, helping the oppressed. Gird up your loins
   then, I pray you, as men that watch for their Lord. If my words could
   have the power in them which I feel they lack, I would stir you up,
   dear brethren and sisters, to seek unto the mighty God of Jacob, that
   when the Son of Man cometh, if he find no faith upon the earth
   elsewhere, at least he may find it in you: if zeal shall be extinct in
   every other place, at least may he find one live coal yet glowing in
   your bosom. For this we want his presence, for without it we can do
   nothing.

   II. This brings me, in the second place, to observe, that IF WE WOULD
   HAVE THE PRESENCE OF GOD, IT IS NECESSARY THAT WE SHOULD BE AGREED WITH
   HIM.

   We must be agreed with God as to the end of our Christian existence.
   God hath formed us for himself, that we may show forth his praise. The
   main end of a Christian man is, that having been bought with precious
   blood, he may live unto Christ, and not unto himself. O brethren! I am
   afraid we are not agreed with God in this. I must say it, painful
   though it be, there are many professors, and there are some in this
   Church, who at least appear to believe that the main end of their
   Christian existence is to get to heaven, to get as much money as they
   can on earth, and to leave as much as they can to their children when
   they die; I say, "to get to heaven," for they selfishly include that as
   one of the designs of divine grace; but I question, if it were not for
   their happiness to go to heaven, whether they would care much about
   going, if it were only for God's glory; for their way of living upon
   earth is always thus: "What shall I eat? what shall I drink?
   wherewithal shall I be clothed?" Religion never calls out their
   thoughtfulness. They can judge, and weigh, and plot, and plan to get
   money, but they have no plans as to how they can serve God. The cause
   of God is scarcely in their thoughts. They will pinch and screw to see
   how little they can contribute in any way to the maintenance of the
   cause of truth, or to the spread of the Redeemer's kingdom; they will
   so far condescend to consider religion, as to think how they can
   profess it in the most economical manner, but nothing more. You will
   not hear me speak so foolishly and madly, as if I thought that it were
   not just and laudable in a man to seek to make money to supply the
   wants of his family, or even to provide for them on his own decease;
   such a thing is just and right: but whenever this gets to be the main
   thought; and I am persuaded it is the leading thought of too many
   professors, such men forget whose they are, and whom they serve; they
   are living to themselves; they have forgotten who it is that has said,
   "Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as with silver and
   gold." Oh! I pray God that I may feel that I am God's man, that I have
   not a hair on my head which is not consecrated, nor a drop of my blood
   which is not dedicated to his cause; and I pray, brethren and sisters,
   that you may feel the same; that selfishness may clean die out of you;
   that you may be able to say without any straining of the truth, "I have
   nothing to care for, nor to live for in this world, but that I may
   glorify God, and spread forth the savour of my Saviour's name." We
   cannot expect the Master's blessing till we are agreed about this. This
   is God's will: is it our will to-day? I know I have around me many
   faithful hearts, who will say, "My desire is, that whether I live or
   die, Christ may be glorified in me": if we be all of that mind, God
   will walk with us; but every one who is of another mind, and of a
   divided heart, is a hindrance and an injury to us in our progress. It
   would be no loss to lose such persons, but a spiritual benefit to the
   entire cause, if this dead lumber were cast out. When the body gets a
   piece of rotten bone into it, it never rests, till, with pain, it casts
   out the dead thing: and so with the Church; the Church may be increased
   by dead members, but when she begins to get vigorous and full of life,
   her first effort is with much pain, perhaps with much marring of her
   present beauty, to cause the dead substance to come forth; and if this
   should be the case, though we shall pity those who are cast forth, yet
   for our own health's sake, we may thank God and take courage.

   If we would have God with us we must be agreed as to the real
   desirableness and necessity of the conversion of souls. God thinks
   souls to be very precious, and his own words are, "As I live, saith the
   Lord, I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, but had rather
   that he should turn unto me and live." Are we agreed with God in that?
   Our God thinks souls to be so precious, that if a man could gain the
   whole world and lose his soul, he would be a loser. Are we agreed with
   him there? In the person of Christ, our God wept over Jerusalem;
   watered with tears that city which must be given up to the flames. Have
   we tears, too? have we compassion, too? When God thinks of sinners it
   is in this wise: "How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I
   deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set
   thee as Zeboim?" Can we bemoan sinners in that way? Do we stir our
   souls to an agony of grief because men will turn from God and will
   wilfully perish in their sin? If, on the contrary, you and I selfishly
   say, "We are safe, it does not matter to us whether others are brought
   to know Christ," we are not agreed, God will not work with us; and such
   of you as feel this indifferentism, this cursed lethargy, are our bane,
   our burden, our hindrance. God forgive you, and stir you up to feel
   that your heart will not rest unless poor sinners are plucked as brands
   from the burning. Are we agreed here?

   If we would have the Lord with us, in the next place, we must be agreed
   as to the means to be used in revival. We are agreed that the first
   means is the preaching of Christ. We do not want any other doctrine
   than that we have received-- Christ lifted up upon his cross, as the
   serpent was lifted up upon the pole. This is the remedy which we, in
   this house of prayer, believe in. Let others choose sweet music, or
   pictures, or vestments, or baptismal water, or confirmation, or human
   rites; we abhor them, and pour contempt upon them; as for us, our only
   hope lies in the doctrine of a substitute for sinners, the great fact
   of the atonement, the glorious truth that Christ Jesus came into the
   world to seek and to save sinners. I think we are agreed with God in
   this, that the preaching of Christ is the way by which believers shall
   be saved. God's great agency is the Holy Spirit. We are agreed,
   brethren, that we do not want sinners to be converted by our
   persuasion, we do not want them brought into the Church by excitement;
   we want the Spirit's work, and the Spirit's work alone. I would not
   bend my knee once in prayer, much less day by day, to win a mere
   excitement; we have done without it, and we shall do without it by the
   grace of God; but I would give mine eyes, if I might but know that the
   Holy Spirit himself would come forth, and show what divinity can do in
   turning hearts of stone to flesh. In this thing, I think , that we are
   agreed with God. But God's way of blessing the Church is by the
   instrumentality of all her members. The multitude must be fed, but it
   must not be by Christ's hand alone, "He gave the bread to the
   disciples, and the disciples, to the multitude." Are you all agreed
   here? I am afraid not. Many of you are engaged in works of usefulness,
   and I will make this my boast this day, that I had never thought that I
   should meet with a people so apostolic in their zeal as the most of you
   have been. I have marvelled, and my heart has rejoiced when I have seen
   what self-sacrifice some of the poorest among you have made for Christ;
   what zeal, what enthusiasm you have manifested in the spreading abroad
   of the Saviour's name. But still there are some of you who are doing
   nothing whatever, you have a name to live, but I fear that you are
   dead; you are very seldom at a prayer-meeting--even some Church members
   and persons whom I know are not kept at home by business, but by sheer
   indifference to the cause of God. Some of you are never provoked to
   zeal and to good works. That you come and listen to us, is something;
   and for what you do we are grateful; but for what you do not do, over
   this we mourn, because we fear that we are restrained in our efforts
   for the spread of the Saviour's kingdom, because as a Church we are not
   agreed in God's plan; and we shall be restrained until every man in the
   Church can say, "I will consecrate myself this day unto the Lord of
   hosts; if there is anything to be done, be it to be a door-keeper in
   the house of God, here am I.

   "There's not a lamb among his flock,

   I would disdain to feed;

   There's not a foe before whose face

   I'd fear his cause to plead."

   Yet again, dear friends, are we agreed this day as to our utter
   helplessness in this work? I caught a good sentence the other day.
   Speaking with a Wesleyan minister, I said to him, "Your denomination
   during the past year did not increase: you have usually had a large
   increase to your numbers. You were never so rich as now; your ministers
   were never so well educated; you never had such good chapels as now,
   and yet you never had so little success. What are you doing?--knowing
   this to be the fact, what are you doing? How are the minds of your
   brethren exercised with regard to this?" He comforted me much by the
   reply. He said, "It has driven us to our knees: we thank God that we
   know our state and are not content with it. We have had a day of
   humiliation, and I hope," he said, "some of us have gone low enough to
   be blessed." There is a great truth in that last sentence, "low enough
   to be blessed," I do fear me that some of us never do go low enough to
   be blessed. When a man says, "Oh! yes, we are getting on very well, we
   do not want any revival that I know of," I fear me he is not low enough
   to be blessed; and when you and I pray to God with pride in us, with
   self-exaltation, with a confidence in our own zeal, or even in the
   prevalence of our own prayers of themselves, we have not come low
   enough to be blessed. An humble Church will be a blessed Church; a
   Church that is willing to confess its own errors and failures, and to
   lie at the foot of Christ's cross, is in a position to be favoured of
   the Lord. I hope we are agreed, then, with God, as to our utter
   unworthiness and helplessness, so that we look to him alone.

   I charge you all to be agreed with God in this thing, that if any good
   shall be done, any conversions shall occur, all the glory must be given
   to him. Revivals have often been spoiled, either by persons boasting
   that such-and-such a minister was the means of them, or else, as in the
   case of the North of Ireland, by boasting that the work was done
   without ministers. That revival, mark you, was stopped in its very
   midst and seriously damaged by being made a kind of curiosity, and a
   thing to be gazed at and to be wondered at by persons both at home and
   abroad. God does not care to work for the honour of men, either of
   ministers or of laymen, or of Churches either; and if we should say,
   "Ah! well, I should like to see the presence of God with us that we may
   have many conversions, and put it in the Magazine, and say, that is how
   things are done at the Tabernacle," why we should not have a blessing
   that way. Crowns! crowns! crowns! but all for thy head Jesu! laurels
   and wreaths! but none for man, all for him whose own right hand and
   whose holy arm hath gotten him the victory. We must all be agreed on
   this point, and I hope we are.

   3. And now to conclude. LET US PUT AWAY ALL THOSE THINGS WHICH OFFEND
   OUR GOD.

   Before God appeared upon Mount Sinai, the children of Israel had to
   cleanse themselves for three days. Before Israel could take possession
   of the promised rest of Canaan, Joshua had to see to it that they were
   purified by the rite of circumcision. Whenever God would visit his
   people, he always demands of them some preparatory purging, that they
   may be fit to behold his presence; for two cannot walk together, unless
   that which would make them disagree be purged out. A few suggestions
   then, as to whether there is anything in us with which God cannot
   agree. Here I cannot preach to you indiscriminately, but put the task
   into the hand of each man to preach to himself. In the days of the
   great weeping, we read that every man wept apart and his wife apart,
   the son apart, and the daughter apart, all the families apart. So it
   must be here. Is there pride in me? Am I puffed up with my talent, my
   substance, my character, my success? Lord purge this out of me, or else
   thou canst not walk with me, for none shall ever say that God and the
   proud soul are friends: he giveth grace to the humble; as for the
   proud, he knoweth them afar off, and will not let them come near to
   him. Am I slothful? do I waste hours which I might usefully employ?
   Have I the levity of the butterfly, which flits from flower to flower,
   but drinks no honey from any of them? or have I the industry of the
   bee, which, wherever it lights, would find some sweet store for the
   hive? Lord, thou knowest my soul, thou understandest me. Am I doing
   little where I might do much? Hast thou had but little reaping for much
   sowing? Have I hid my talent in a napkin? Have I spent that talent for
   myself, instead of spending it for thee? Slothful souls cannot walk
   with God. "My Father worketh," saith Jesus, "and I work"; and you who
   stand in the market-place idle, may stand there with the devil, but you
   cannot stand there with God. Let every brother who is guilty of this,
   purge away his sloth.

   Or am I guilty of worldliness. This is the crying sin of many in the
   Christian Church. Do I put myself into association with men who cannot
   by any possibility profit me? Am I seen where my Master would not go?
   Do I love amusements which cannot afford me comfort when I reflect upon
   them; and which I would never indulge in, if I thought that Christ
   would come while I was at them? Am I worldly in spirit as to fashion?
   Am I as showy, as volatile, as frivolous as men and women of the world?
   If so, if I love the world, the love of the Father is not in me;
   consequently he cannot walk with me, for we are not agreed.

   Again, am I covetous? do I scrape and grind? is my first thought, not
   how I can honour God, but how I can accumulate wealth? When I gain
   wealth, do I forget to make use of it as a steward? If so, then God is
   not agreed with me; I am a thief with his substance; I have set myself
   up for a master instead of being a servant, and God will not walk with
   me till I begin to feel that this is not my own, but his; and that I
   must use it in his fear.

   Again, am I of an angry spirit? Am I harsh towards my brethren? Do I
   cherish envy towards those who are better than myself, or contempt
   towards those who are worse off? If so, God cannot walk with me, for he
   hates envy, and all contempt of the poor is abhorrent to him. Is there
   any lust in me? Do I indulge the flesh? Am I fond of carnal indulgences
   by which my soul suffers? If so, God will not walk with me; for
   chambering, and wantonness, and gluttony, and drunkenness, separate
   between a believer and his God: these things are not convenient to a
   Christian. Before the great feast of unleavened bread, a Jewish parent
   would sweep out every piece of leaven from his house; and so anxious
   would he be, and so anxious is the Jew at the present day, that he take
   a candle and sweeps out every cupboard, no matter though there may have
   been no food put in there at any time, he is afraid lest by accident a
   crumb may be somewhere concealed in the house; and so, from the garret
   to the cellar, he clears the whole house through, to purge out the old
   leaven. Let us do so. I cannot think you will do so as the effect of
   such poor words as mine; but if my soul could speak to you, and God
   blessed the utterance, you would. For my own part, I cry unto my
   Master, that if there be anything that can make me more fit to be the
   messenger of God to you and to the sons of men, however painful might
   be the preparatory process, he would graciously be pleased not to spare
   me of it. If by sickness, if by serious calamities, if by slander and
   rebuke, more honour can be brought to him, then hail! and welcome! all
   these things; they shall be my joy; and to receive them shall be
   delight. I pray you, utter the same desire: "Lord, make me fit to be
   the means of glorifying thee."

   "The dearest idol I have known,

   Whate'er that idol be;

   Help me to tear it from its throne,

   And worship only thee."

   What! do you demur? Do you want for ever to go on in the old
   dead-and-alive way in which the Churches are just now? Do you feel no
   sacred passion stirring your breast to anguish for the present, and to
   hope for the future? O ye cravens, who dread the battle, slink to your
   beds; but ye who have your Master's spirit in you, and would long to
   see brighter and better days, lift up your heads with confidence in him
   who will walk with us if we be agreed.

   My text has a main bearing upon the unconverted: I think of preaching
   from it this evening to those who are not agreed with God, and who
   cannot walk with him. I pray that they may be reconciled unto God by
   the death of his Son; and the most likely means to accomplish this,
   will be by your earnest and fervent prayers. O Lord, hear and answer
   for Jesus' sake. Amen.

   [Mr. Spurgeon's Sermon on "Baptismal Regeneration" has now reached the
   180th thousand; it is felt to be important that it should be still more
   widely circulated, and friends are urged to make an earnest effort to
   scatter it far and wide.]

                                  Two Visions

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 6, 1864,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "I saw by night and behold a Man riding upon a red horse and He stood
   among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom and behind Him were
   there red horses, speckled and white. Then said I, O my Lord, what are
   these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will show you
   what these are, And the Man that stood among the myrtle trees answered
   and said, These are they whom the Lord has sent to walk to and fro
   through the earth. And they answered the Angel of the Lord that stood
   among the myrtle trees and said, We have walked to and fro through the
   earth and behold, all the earth sits still and is at rest. Then the
   Angel of the Lord answered and said, O Lord of Hosts, how long will You
   not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which
   You have had indignation these threescore and ten years? And the Lord
   answered the angel that talked with me with good words and comfortable
   words. So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry you,
   saying, Thus says the Lord of Hosts; Iam jealous for Jerusalem and for
   Zion with a great jealousy. And I am very sorely displeased with the
   heathen that are at ease: for I was but a little displeased and they
   helped forward the affliction.

   Therefore thus says the Lord; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies:
   My house shall be built in it, says the Lord of Hosts and a line shall
   be stretched forth upon Jerusalem. Cry yet, saying, Thus says the Lord
   of hosts: My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad. And
   the Lord shall yet comfort Zion and shall yet choose Jerusalem. Then
   lifted I up my eyes and sa w and behold four horns. And I said unto the
   angel that talked with me, What are these? And he answered me, These
   are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem. And the
   Lord showed me four carpenters. Then said I, What come these to do? And
   He spoke, saying, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so
   that no man did lift up his head: but these are come to scatter them,
   to cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up their horn over
   the land of Judah to scatter it."

   Zechariah 1:8-21.

   THIS is a somewhat dark and mysterious passage. And if we should ask
   many a reader, "Do you understand what you are reading?" he would be
   compelled to reply as did the Ethiopian eunuch, "How can I, except some
   man should guide me?" Although there are some portions of the Word of
   God which are hard to be understood--by far the greater portion of
   Scriptures which are at first perplexing--will open up if we will
   carefully peruse them and prayerfully ask the illumination of God's
   Holy Spirit.

   We should seek to know all of God's Word which can be known. You will
   perceive that the Prophet Zechariah himself was not content with
   beholding the two visions described in this passage, but had to ask, in
   the ninth verse, "O my Lord, what are these?" And then, again, in the
   nineteenth verse, "What are these?" Nor did he cease his enquiries! In
   the twenty-first verse he says, "What come these to do?" If the seer of
   the vision asked for an interpretation, much more may you and I.

   He was not idly curious, but reverently teachable--let us imitate his
   holy diligence in desiring to learn. Be it remembered that God's Word
   is never out of date. It is not like an almanac which is useful this
   year, but which will be mere waste paper the next. It always stands
   good. And the promise of God, when once fulfilled, are still valid for
   another fulfillment. Unlike a check, which being once paid, ceases to
   be of any force, the promises of God have a perpetual value in them!
   And if we can lay hold upon them by faith, having once drawn upon the
   great bank of Divine Mercy, we may go again with the same word and get
   as much from the liberal hand of God as we did before.

   Let us come, then, with reverent attention to this passage hoping that
   God will instruct us in its meaning and help us to grasp its promises
   and win a new fulfillment. The two visions before us describe the
   condition of Israel in Zechariah's day. But being interpreted in their
   aspect towards us, they describe the Church of God as we find it just
   now in the world. You notice that the first vision opens with a view of
   the Church of God. It is described as a myrtle grove flourishing in a
   valley.

   The Church of God is hidden, unobserved, secreted as in a valley. The
   careless gazer doesn't see her. She courts no honor--she comes not with
   observation. The Church has endured neglect and shame from the time of
   the Cross until now--her day of glory is to come at the manifestation
   of the Lord from Heaven, but at present--

   "It is no surprising thing
   That we should be unknown.
   The Jewish world knew not their King,
   God's everlasting Son."

   When Christ came, despised and rejected of men, His Glory had not
   broken forth--He was like the sun in a mist. The Church is like her
   Head--she has a glory, but it is hidden from carnal eyes--persecutions,
   sins, infirmities and reproaches surround her. The time of her breaking
   forth in all her glory is not yet come.

   She lies in the valley where none but a keen observer can discover her.
   You must see the towering mountains, but only a careful eye can
   discover this myrtle grove. Historians write the records of empires,
   but they take slight notice of the true Church of God. An historian who
   should pen the tale of English history might, now and then, come across
   the Church--but it would usually be the political establishment which
   arrogates that title and not the spiritual and separated host of the
   faithful in Christ Jesus--for they are not of the world, even as their
   Lord was not of the world.

   "My kingdom is not of this world," is still most solemnly true. Perhaps
   the position of these myrtles in the valley may indicate the gloom
   which at seasons falls upon the Church--when she is in spiritual
   darkness, when no present favor is shown her by her God in
   Providence--when her pastors weep that their flocks are scattered by
   persecution and her ministers lament that their testimony is neglected.
   They cry, "Who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the
   Lord revealed?" Then Zion is under a cloud--the myrtle grove is
   overshadowed and darkened.

   But I think there is here the idea of tranquil security--the myrtle
   grove in the valley is still and calm, while the storm sweeps over the
   mountain summits. Tempests spend their force upon the craggy peaks of
   the Alps, but down there, where the stream flows which makes glad the
   city of God, the myrtles flourish by the still waters, all unshaken by
   the impetuous wind. How great is the inward tranquility of God's
   Church! She may be hunted upon the mountains, but in peace her martyrs
   possess their souls. She may hide herself in the catacombs of Rome, but
   the memorials upon the old slabs assure us that in the catacombs men
   lived in hallowed peace, and died in joy!

   God's Church in the valley has a peace which the world gives not and
   which, therefore, it cannot take away. It is the peace of God which
   passes all understanding. It keeps the hearts and minds of God's
   people. Is there not also in the metaphor a peaceful, perpetual growth?
   The myrtle sheds not her leaves, she is always green. And the Church,
   in her worst time, still has a blessed verdure of Grace about her! No,
   she has sometimes exhibited most verdure when her winter has been
   sharpest. God's Church has prospered most when her adversities have
   been most severe.

   The myrtle was the emblem of peace and a significant token of victory.
   Were not the brows of conquerors bound with myrtle and with laurel? Is
   not the Church of God, despite the neglect which she suffers from men
   and the occasional gloom which she endures through God's Providence,
   still a victor? May not her saints, as they die, be laid in the grave
   with the myrtle wreath upon them? Is not every Christian more than a
   conqueror through Him that loved him? Living in peace, do not the
   saints fall asleep in triumph?

   You can readily picture to yourselves that quiet, calm, yet somewhat
   somber grove of myrtles. And forget not that in the midst of these
   myrtles, the Glory of the myrtle grove stands--the Son of Man! Oh, it
   is ever the Church's Glory that the Savior is present with her. "Where
   two or three are met together in My name, there am I in the midst of
   them." Here is the Church's strength! Here is her assurance of victory,
   the terror of her enemies, the confidence of her friends! If the

   Church is likened to golden candlesticks, John saw one like unto the
   Son of Man walking in the midst of them. And if she is a myrtle grove,
   then the Man upon the red horse is never absent from her, but stands in
   the midst!

   He is the wall of fire round about the Church and the Glory in the
   midst of her evermore. For the comfort of God's people, let us closely
   view this vision. You say, O son of man, feeble and full of unbelief,
   that God's Church will become extinct, that Popery will devour her and
   infidelity will eat her as does a canker. You fear that the banner of
   the Truth of God will be dashed to the ground and that the enemies of
   the Lord will win the victory. Cast away your fear! Your God appears
   unto you this day and in the visions of His servant Zechariah, He
   reassures you and speaks "good words and comfortable words unto you."

   I. Observe THE LORD JESUS ENGAGED AS THE GREAT DEFENDER OF HIS CHURCH.
   Behold a Man riding upon a red horse. This same Man is called an Angel
   of the Lord. Christ shows Himself among His people as a Man, since He
   is the Head of the new race of men. As Adam was the man, the
   representative man to the whole of fallen humanity, so Jesus stands
   forth the second Adam, the representative Man of twice-born and
   blood-bought humanity. Out of love to His people He became one flesh
   with them and is now most truly called, "The Man Christ Jesus." He is
   not ashamed to call them Brethren.

   Once professors forgot the Godhead of Jesus--we are more likely to
   overlook His true and real Manhood. Bone of our bone is He--flesh of
   our flesh. In no respects different from the rest of men, save only
   that no sin has ever tainted His Nature. He feels as we feel. He thinks
   as we think--He once suffered and died, even as other men. O Church of
   God, rejoice! The glorious Man who is "God over all," is ever in your
   midst! He never forgets you! He never forsakes you! He abides with His
   people after a spiritual sort, forever! And never is this Covenant Head
   separated from His body the Church.

   Inasmuch as He is also called an angel, this may suggest to us the
   doctrine that Christ is in a sense the Head of angels, as well as men.
   What if I were to surmise--and it were no new thought of mine, but one
   which many have indulged-- what if I were to suggest, not as a matter
   of doctrine, but only as a subject for thought--that the same great
   work which redeemed us who were fallen creatures, may have established
   the elect angels, so that they can never fall? I know not how it is
   that the angels have become consolidated in perfection so that they
   cannot now sin, unless it is through the virtue of the Savior.

   Could they have been so created? A moral agent must necessarily have
   the power to sin--if it had no power to sin, it would need no Law. But
   for God to create a creature beyond all Law, to say the least, would be
   unsafe--it were, in fact, to set up other gods--for a creature that
   knew no Law would be a rival to the Godhead! But so long as a creature
   is under Law, it may offend and so fall. How, then, came the angels in
   such a condition that they cannot sin? Is it not that they are now
   removed by a special act of Grace from under the Law and put into a
   condition of gracious permanence such as Law could never give them? And
   was this act of Grace the result of that great transaction upon
   Calvary?

   Is this one part of the Apostle's meaning when he says, "By Him all
   things consist"? Was there in the Atonement a virtue which has
   established the elect angels forever in perfect holiness so that they
   should never sin? Why is it that other creatures beside men join in the
   song? (Rev. 5:9, 10). "You are worthy to take the Book and to open the
   seals thereof: for You were slain and have redeemed US to God by Your
   blood, out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation. And have
   made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the
   earth."

   Why did the cherubic emblems stand upon the Mercy Seat and why were
   they made part and parcel of it, if not to show that while man bends as
   a sinner before that Mercy Seat and receives pardon, angels stand as
   sinless beings, looking down upon that Mercy Seat which is the
   groundwork of their eternal safety? It seems to me to magnify the
   greatness of the Atonement that it affected Heaven as well as earth and
   that throughout all the principalities and powers there would be a
   reason why they should bow with holy gratitude before Jesus the Lord,
   seeing that He has redeemed them from future falling by His precious
   blood.

   Whether this is so or not, certainly Jesus is the true Archangel--He is
   the Head of principalities and powers, as well as the Head of redeemed
   men. He is called "the Angel of the Covenant," as God's messenger sent
   forth to fulfill God's will in Covenant purposes to His children. Oh,
   this is the joy of the Church, that Jesus the Man, Jesus the Angel, is
   ever in her midst! He is represented as riding upon a horse. This is to
   show His swiftness. He flies upon the wings of the wind to defend His
   people.

   An ordinary commander cannot be in two places at once--and while the
   right wing has victory under his leadership, the left may be broken.
   But our Savior rides swiftly as the flashes of thought along the whole
   ranks, cheers them all on, and secures to every warrior the ultimate
   victory! Riding on the horse is a symbol of His zeal. He comes with all
   His power and might, flying with all speed so that none of His people
   should perish. He shows Himself strong on behalf of them that serve Him
   and is jealous for them with a fervent jealousy.

   But why a red horse? Does this describe His Atonement? Does this
   picture His sufferings? Is it His own blood with which the horse is
   covered? Or is he bespattered with the blood of his foes slain in
   battle? "The Lord is a man of war: the Lord is His name." He comes from
   Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah, glorious in His apparel,
   traveling in the greatness of His strength because He has trod the
   winepress of wrath and trod His foes in His fury. Does this manifest
   the terror, the strength, the majesty of Him whose name is "the Lion of
   the tribe of Judah"?

   The day is coming when He will ride on His white horse and go forth
   conquering and to conquer. But today it is the red horse--for His
   Church still suffers--still is she stained with the blood of
   persecution. John says that when he saw the Son of Man, "His feet were
   like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace," and so is it
   still with our Lord--His head is glorious in Heaven, but His feet, we
   that have fallen upon these evil days, glow still in the furnace! As
   far as earth is concerned, then, the fitting picture of Christ is the
   Man upon the red horse in the midst of the myrtle trees. Rejoice, O you
   people of God, that Jesus is in the midst of His saints with His sword
   girt upon His thigh!

   II. I take you a step farther. For the comfort of God's people we have
   not only Christ engaged, but we see THE

   WHOLE ANGELIC HOST READY TO DO US SERVICE. Observe that behind the Man
   on the red horse was a company of horses--of course these were not
   horses without riders, for they are represented as speaking. The Church
   of God has the angels of Heaven to be her protectors. These angels are
   described as mounted, to represent their swiftness--"He makes His
   angels spirits, His ministers a flame of fire."

   You perceive also the strength of the horse mingled with its
   swiftness--what God bids His messengers perform, they do. Who can stay
   their hand! He gives them a charge and girds them with His own power.
   Zeal quickens every step of these burning ones. Standing with wings
   outstretched, they wait upon the Divine will. And when the command is
   given, no eagle cleaves the air so swiftly as the holy ones. They
   appear to be of different sorts. There are those who are commissioned
   for vengeance--these ride upon the red horses of God's tremendous
   wrath. Who knows how often and how terribly angels may have struck
   through the loins of kings! An angel slew Sennacherib's host. Was it
   not an angel that struck Herod? Has not God still upon His red horses,
   angels that shall speedily make an end of the Church's proudest
   persecutors?

   Then there are those on the white horses that come to bless God's
   saints. Was it not such a spirit that delivered Peter from prison and
   cheered the heart of Paul in the stormy night? Who knows how often they
   strengthen the faint and comfort the broken-hearted? They are ever
   ascending and descending upon that ladder which Jacob saw. Some come to
   curse the wicked, but as many come to bless the righteous. As for the
   speckled or bay horses--these are the mingled circumstances in which
   you see both the mercy and judgment of God--angels are not strangers to
   these, for God employs them upon many occasions.

   What part do angels take in the protection of the Church? I suppose it
   would be very difficult to describe precisely how they act. But that
   they do work for us is most certainly a Scriptural doctrine. They are
   represented as guarding the Lord's people. "He shall give His angels
   charge over you, to keep you in all your ways. They shall bear you up
   in their hands, lest you dash your foot against a stone." "The angel of
   the Lord encamps round about them that fear Him." Have we not some
   reason to believe that angels inject comforting thoughts into our
   minds? When Christ was in the garden, there appeared unto Him an angel
   strengthening Him. May it not be that those warm thoughts which come
   welling up in our minds, as we think, spontaneously, have been
   suggested by angels?

   We are prone to ascribe our temptations to the devil--how is it we do
   not ascribe some of our excellent comforts to the work of angels? Are
   those bad spirits to have the monopoly of dealing with us? Are they to
   be the only spiritual agents? God forbid! Doubtless, as bad ones would
   cast us down from the pinnacle where we stand, so these good ones would
   bear us up! May there not be going on in the air strange battles
   between the demons and the spirits of light? Is the case mentioned in
   Jude the only one in which an angel has contended with the devil? Are
   there no combats such as that described by Daniel in his tenth chapter,
   where Gabriel and Michael seem to be both engaged against a prince of
   the power of the air?

   May it not be that bright angelic squadrons are holding strange fights
   with hosts of demons while the Word is preached, contending for and
   against that glorious Truth which is the power of God unto salvation?
   We know not what spiritual agencies are continually at work. But that
   they are at work is clear enough in the Word of God. Spenser was no
   dreamer when he sang--

   "How oft do they their silver bowers leave To come to succor us that
   succor need! How oft do they with golden pinions clea ve The flitting
   skies, like flying squadrons Against foul fiends to aid us militant!
   They for us fight, they watch and duly ward, And their bright squadrons
   round about us plant. And all for love and nothing for reward-- O why
   should heavenly God to men have such regard?"

   Brethren, may not angels also operate upon the wicked? Is it not
   possible that the strong restraints which sometimes come upon ungodly
   men and the singular thoughts which make them, like Balaam, speak what
   they do not mean and say a good word where they would curse--is it not
   possible that these may be caused by the suggestions of angels? At any
   rate these bright spirits rejoice to minister to the heirs of
   salvation.

   Courage! Courage! Warriors of the Cross! March on to victory, for I
   hear the wings of angels flying at your side! Strike, for angelic
   swords are drawn! Sound your clarions, for the trumpeters of God are
   near. Behold the mountain is full of horses of fire and chariots of
   fire round about the Church of God--more are they that are for us than
   all they that are against us! We are come unto an innumerable company
   of angels, all of whom salute us as fellow soldiers in the host of God.
   Here let us pause and bless the Grace which makes ten thousand times
   ten thousand angels the allies of the warriors of the Cross.

   III. As you read on, you will perceive another ground of comfort to
   those of you who are alarmed for the Church of God. WE HAVE THE WHOLE
   OF PROVIDENCE ENGAGED UPON OUR SIDE. Thus it is written, "These are
   they whom the Lord has sent to walk to and fro through the earth." They
   gave the result of their reconnoiter--they said, "We have walked to and
   fro through the earth and behold, all the earth sits still and is at
   rest." According to the first chapter of the book of Ezekiel, the four
   living creatures, whom I take to represent angels, always co-worked
   with the wheels.

   The mysterious agency of angels is at work together and in unison with
   the great work of Providence. Whatever may be occurring, great or
   small, is certainly happening for the good of God's Church and for the
   propagation of God's Truth. How singularly does God, in political
   events, prepare men's minds for the particular phase which His Church
   assumes! There was perfect peace over the whole world at the time when
   Christ was put to death. The whole world was subject to one dominion,
   so that the Apostle Paul and his coadjutors could preach everywhere the
   unsearchable riches of Christ.

   I cannot go into the question this morning. But every Christian student
   of history knows that the circumstances of the outward world have ever
   been arranged by God so as to prepare the way for the advance of His
   great cause. How strangely Providence works to spread the Truth of God.
   They said of Martin Luther's writings, that they were scattered by
   angels. No such distributors were employed. But still they were
   scattered so widely that it was a perfect mystery how it was done.
   There was scarcely a little peddler who went about with jewels who did
   not somewhere in his stock keep a copy of the Word of God or Luther's
   Psalms.

   It was said that in England, out of every three persons you met with in
   the road, though they might be but peasants breaking stones, there
   would be one of the three a Wickliffe--for Wickliffe's translation of
   the New Testament spread marvelously--though it was continually hunted
   after and burnt when discovered. You will find, if I am not mistaken,
   that soon God will scatter broadcast over all lands those testimonies
   which are most clear and most full of Christ! He will do it in such a
   way that our societies will have to hold up their hands in amazement
   and say, "We cannot tell how this was done."

   God finds a market for his wares--he needs not to advertise them. God
   Himself, who revealed His Truth, will incline men's minds to procure
   the Truth. Then how singularly does God work in Providence to prepare
   individuals for His Truth! How many a man has come into this Tabernacle
   with a heart as much prepared for the particular sermon to be delivered
   as it possibly could be so that he has said that the preacher must have
   been told what his feelings were for the Word had come so pointedly
   home! It was nothing but God in Providence plowing the field for the
   seed!

   How often can we see God opening the doors of nations to missionaries!
   It was marvelous that China should become accessible after being shut
   up so many years. And whatever may be said concerning our treatment of
   the Japanese, (and we are not among those who would vindicate or defend
   any tyranny on the part of the strong), yet Japan must be opened and
   the Gospel of God must be preached there!

   For every nation that shuts her gates against the Truth of God shall
   find God's battering ram shake the nation to its foundations sooner
   than His Word shall be shut out. Courage, warriors of the Cross! Christ
   is with you as your Captain! Sound your trumpets and advance to battle!
   If Christ and His angels and the Providence of God all work with you,
   who can be against you?--

   "When He makes bare His arm, What shall His work withstand? When He His
   people's cause defends, Who, who shall stay His hand?"

   IV. I come now to point out to you something equally interesting and
   even more comfortable in this vision. We have here AN INTERCEDING
   SAVIOR. The twelfth verse--"Then the Angel of the Lord answered and
   said, O Lord of Hosts, how long will You not have mercy on Jerusalem
   and on the cities of Judah, against which You have had indignation
   these threescore and ten years?" That same Christ, who is on earth in
   spirit, on the red horse, is in Heaven in Person, pleading before the
   Throne of God.

   Let me not talk coldly upon this, but carry up your hearts to Heaven. I
   think I see Him, the Angel of the Covenant-- He pleads--He pleads for
   mercy. Mercy that sent Him to earth--mercy is His petition now. He
   pleads for present mercy. His cry is, "How long? Eighteen hundred years
   is it since My blood was offered and yet My kingdom has not come! Lo,
   nearly two thousand years have rolled away and yet Antichrist is not
   slain, but Satan's seat is still upon the seven hills! How long? How
   long? How long?"

   Observe the objects of His intercession. He pleads for Jerusalem and
   Judah. "I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which
   You have given Me." With what pleading power He points to His wounds
   and declares Himself to be no other than that mighty One who discharged
   the Father's will and bore the whole of Divine wrath! And must He not
   prevail? Church of God, if you can be rejected, yet He cannot be! Shall
   the Darling of the Father receive no answer to His cry? Does He plead
   for us and shall we be afraid? No! In the name of Him who lives and
   loves and pleads before the Eternal Throne, let us set up our banner!
   For God has given the victory into our hands in answer to the pleadings
   of His Son.

   V. Nor is this all--observe that WE HAVE IN THIS VISION A GRACIOUS
   God--for as soon as the plea was put up, the Lord answered the Angel
   that talked with Him, "with good words and comfortable words." O Zion,
   there are good things in store for you! Church of God, your time of
   travail shall soon be over and your children shall be brought forth!
   Your captivity shall end and the day of manifestation shall appear.
   Bear patiently the rod for a season and under the darkness still trust
   in God, for He has not forgotten you. "Can a woman forget her sucking
   child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yes,
   they may forget, yet will I not forget you. Behold, I have engraved you
   upon the palms of My hands. Your walls are continually before Me."

   God loves the Church with a love too deep for human imagination to
   understand--He loves her with all His infinite heart. Therefore be of
   good courage, she cannot need anything, to whom God speaks "good words
   and comfortable words." What these comfortable words are the Prophet
   goes on to tell us--"I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a
   great jealousy." You perceive He loves her so much that He cannot bear
   she should go astray to others. And when she has done so, He cannot
   endure that she should suffer too much or too heavily. He will not have
   His enemies afflict her-- He is displeased with them because they
   increase her affliction.

   When God seems most to leave His Church, yet His heart is very warm
   towards her. It is remarkable that whenever God uses a rod to chasten
   His servants, He always breaks it--as if He loathed the rod which gave
   His children pain. As soon as ever God struck Israel, whether by
   Moabite, or Midianite, Babylonian, Persian, Assyrian, Greek, or
   Roman--in every case He broke the rod in pieces as soon as He had used
   it, for He is loath to vex His people. He feels the smart far more than
   His people. "As a father pities his children, so the Lord pities them
   that fear Him," and the rod cuts Him more than it cuts His Church.

   Let us be of good courage! God has not forgotten us. You may belong to
   a part of the Church which is in great obscurity, but He has not
   forgotten it. You may think that the Lord has passed you by, but He has
   not--He that counts the stars and calls them all by name has no limit
   to His understanding and no measure to His knowledge! He binds up the
   broken in heart and heals their wounds. And He knows your case and
   state as much and as perfectly as if you were the only creature He had
   ever made, or the only saint He had ever loved!

   VI. We must now consider the second vision of Zechariah, prophetic of
   SUITABLE INSTRUMENTALITY. It was dark and as the Prophet looked into
   the air with wonder, the Rider on the red horse melted away and the
   myrtle grove disappeared. The horses, too--whether bay, or red, or
   white--with their angelic riders, were gone. Instead of these, he saw
   in the sky four terrible horns. They were pushing this way and that
   way, dashing down the strongest and the mightiest.

   And the Prophet naturally asked, "What are these?" The answer was,
   "These are the horns which have scattered Israel." He saw before him a
   representation of those powers which had oppressed the Church of God.
   There were four of them, for the Church is attacked on all sides. Well
   might the Prophet have felt dismayed. But all of a sudden there
   appeared before him four carpenters. He asked, "What shall these do?"
   The original may as well be translated four blacksmiths. Perhaps the
   better way would be to make it four workmen. If they were carpenters,
   they were doubtless armed with their saws--or if blacksmiths they came
   with their heavy hammers. "What shall these do?"

   Why, these are the men whom God has found to break those horns to
   pieces and scattered or frightened the powers which wield them.
   Brethren, God will always find men for His work. If He requires
   carpenters, He has only to call for them and there they are. If
   blacksmiths shall be better, "He creates the smith that blows the coals
   in the fire." You look upon the scarcity of ministers--it is true there
   is a great lack of faithful servants of God. But remember, you have but
   to pray that He would thrust forth more laborers into His vineyard and
   the thing is done!

   God always knows where to find men for His work. And He finds men at
   the right time. The Prophet did not see the carpenters first, when
   there was nothing to do, but first the horns and then the carpenters.
   Of late, there has been a great increase of infidelity--infidelity of
   the worst kind--that lying infidelity which swears that it believes the
   Articles of the Christian faith and wears a miter, or a priest's frock,
   and believes nothing of the kind. Well, I suppose, any lie may find
   fitting refuge beneath the wings of the Anglican Establishment!

   What solemn criminality must belong to those who utter falsehood in the
   name of the Holy Spirit, and, acting in the office of priests, justify
   the wicked for a reward! To say in God's name what I know to be untrue
   is a crime which transcends in infamy all other crimes of mankind--I
   will not even exclude murder--if it is upon provocation. For to murder
   souls deliberately by teaching a lie is as great a crime as to slay a
   man in haste. Let me give an instance of how our State Church sins
   against morality and Scripture--it is taken from last week's paper:

   "One of the most shocking scenes that ever occurred in connection with
   the prize ring, took place in Sheffield yesterday (Sunday). A number of
   young men and youths, frequenters of some of the lowest brothels and
   beerhouses in the town, agreed to meet in the Old Park Wood and fight
   for a sum of money. One pair of boxers set to and fought for an hour.
   And then the arena was cleared for another couple, two young men named
   Dawes and Home. They fought for twenty minutes and Dawes received a
   heavy blow on the jugular. He was placed on his second's knee. Time was
   called, amidst much shouting and yelling. He got up and advanced to
   meet his antagonist but had not gone a yard before he reeled, fell and
   died instantly."

   A few graphic lines from The Sheffield Daily Telegraph will describe
   the burial of this unhappy youth--"The remains of Dawes (who was killed
   in a prize fight on Sunday morning), were interred yesterday afternoon
   at the general cemetery. A heterogeneous multitude--old and young of
   both sexes from the squalling cherub in arms, to the decrepit
   hag--thronged the sacred edifice. Still more numerous, ill-mannered and
   ill-conditioned was the throng who clustered around the
   grave--pig-headed and bull-necked young fellows, mostly under twenty
   years of age who must have been the representatives of the 'P.R.' in
   Sheffield. The Service for the Dead was performed by the Rev. G.
   Sandford and at its conclusion the rabble departed."

   Did this clergyman give God hearty thanks that it had pleased Him to
   deliver this brother out of the miseries of this sinful world? Did he
   pray the Father to raise the bystanders from their death in sin unto
   the life of righteousness, that when they shall depart this life, they
   may rest in Him, "as our hope is this, our Brother, does"? I am called
   uncharitable for denouncing this infamy. I beg to offer apologies. I
   have said I cannot understand how Evangelical clergymen can bring their
   conscience to perform such enormities. I apologize--I apologize
   altogether. I will not say again, "I wonder how they can bring their
   consciences to it"--for when men act thus, I believe they have no
   consciences at all!

   Thus far I apologize, but no further. Conscience must be seared
   utterly, if not extinct, when the man can stand there, dressed in the
   habit of a priest of God and say over a sinner who has died in the very
   act of sin, that he buries him in sure and certain hope of the
   resurrection to eternal life! Let these men find a trade where
   truthfulness is not essential to success. But for them to stand as
   teachers and claim to be successors of the Apostles is an evil which
   might stir the very stones of the street to cry out against them!

   But for the putting down of these giant evils, God will find men at the
   right time and as this evil seems to have mounted to the very highest
   pitch, He will find somewhere a hand to scatter this horn. Observe,
   again, He finds enough men. He did not find three carpenters, but four.
   There were four horns and there must be four smiths and each smith must
   take his proper place. And then He finds the right men--not four
   gentlemen with pens to write--not four architects to draw plans, but
   four mechanics to do rough work! He who wants to open an oyster, must
   not use a razor--there needs less of daintiness and more of force. For
   some works Providence does not find gentlemen to cut off the horns, but
   carpenters.

   The work needs a man who, when he has his work to do, puts his whole
   strength into it and beats away with his hammer, or cuts through the
   wood that lays before him with might and main. Rest assured, you who
   tremble for the ark of God, that when the horns grow troublesome, the
   carpenters will be found. You need not fret concerning the weakness of
   the Church of God at any moment! There may be growing up in the chimney
   corner the man who will shake the nations! Chrysostoms may come forth
   from our Ragged Schools and Augustines from the thickest darkness of
   London's poverty!

   The Lord knows where to find His servants--they may be in the
   Universities of Cambridge or Oxford, or possibly in the peasant's hut.
   He has but to hold up His finger and as Luther and Melanethon and
   Calvin and Zwingle and Bucer and Farrell and multitudes of the same
   kind were found--and as in modern times on the continent, Haldane was
   the means of calling forth Malan and Gaussen and Vinet and D'Aubigne
   and the whole company of the Monods and multitudes of faithful servants
   to bring back the Helvetian and Gallic Churches to their
   allegiance--so, let God but find one man at first to bear the brunt and
   they come! They come, an exceeding great army!

   Be it ours to deliver the Word and leave the results with God. And His
   army, though it may now be hidden, shall stand forth ready for the
   battle. God has in ambush a multitude of mighty men and at His word
   they shall be ready for the battle--for the battle is the Lord's--and
   He shall deliver the enemy into our hands. These two visions seem to me
   to be full of comfort to the true Church of God. Let us abide then,
   dear Friends, faithful to Christ, faithful to His Word and who knows
   what may come?

   But if we are God's enemies, let us fear and tremble, for the angels on
   the black horses shall be our destruction. And as God is strong to
   defend His people, so is He strong and swift to slay His enemies.
   Beware, you who forget God, lest He tear you in pieces and there be
   none to deliver you. Fly to Jesus, trust Him and live!

                   The Certainty And Freeness Of Divine Grace

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 13, 1864, BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT
   THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me; and him that comes to
   Me I will in no wise cast out."

   John 6:37.

   LET it be forevermore remembered that the words of Jesus Christ are
   full of Truth and Grace. And that in each of these two sentences,
   whether we perceive the fact or not, there is the surest Truth and the
   freest Grace. There will be some who from the peculiarity of their
   minds, will prize most the first sentence. They will say, as they read
   these words, "All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me"--why, here
   is high doctrine! Here is the security of the Covenant, the purpose of
   God effectually carried out! Here is the Truth of God which we love and
   the Grace in which we glory."

   Other Brethren, overlooking the first sentence lest it should raise
   questions too hard to be answered, will rather grasp at the second
   sentence, "Him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out." "Why,"
   they say, "here is universality of description! Here is a freeness of
   invitation! Here is a gracious overflow of liberality--this is good
   free Gospel, indeed!" And they will therefore fall to proclaiming the
   second sentence to the neglect of the first.

   But, Brothers and Sisters, let us not sin by setting one Scripture
   against another, or attempting to divide the living child of
   Revelation. It is one and it is alike glorious in all its parts. You
   who love to hear the Gospel preached to sinners do not be afraid of the
   doctrines of Sovereign Grace! And you who love Sovereign Grace but
   cannot well hear doctrine too high for your taste, do not be afraid of
   the free invitations of the Gospel and the wide door which Jesus opens
   for needy sinners in many passages of Scripture!

   Let us receive all Truth and let us be willing to learn every lesson
   which the Lord has written, remembering that if we cannot as yet
   reconcile Truths of God, there is the promise--"What I do you know not
   now; but you shall know hereafter." If we could know everything, we
   would be gods! Being mortals, some things must be unknown to us. Let us
   know our ignorance and despair of becoming infallible and thus we shall
   be in the path to true wisdom! But, if we boast of our wisdom, we shall
   be on the high road to great folly.

   Let us consider the text carefully. And as it divides into two
   branches, let us view them one by one. Here we have Grace and Truth
   triumphant in specialty. And, secondly, we have Grace and Truth
   triumphant in liberality. May God help us to handle these so that much
   instruction may flow from them.

   I. In the first sentence, we have GRACE TRIUMPHANT IN SPECIALTY--

   "All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me." I would bring out the
   meaning of this passage by a few observations.

   1. You perceive here that the Lord Jesus leads us up to the original
   position of all things--for since a people were given to Him by the
   Father, it is clear that they must first have been in the Father's
   hands. All men, then, are naturally, from the beginning, in the hands
   of the Father. And so it should be, for He has fashioned them all and
   made them for His pleasure. God, absolutely considered, created all
   things and His kingdom rules over all. Having a right to make laws, to
   issue rewards, or to threaten with punishments at His own pleasure,
   Jehovah sits upon His Throne, judging rightly. The elect were specially
   in the hands of the Father for He had chosen them.

   The choice is ever described as being with the Father--"I thank You, O
   Father, Lord of Heaven and earth, because You have hid these things
   from the wise and prudent and have revealed them unto babes. Even so,
   Father: for so it seemed good in Your sight." They belong to the
   Father, then, as Creator, as Governor and as the source and fountain of
   election. How often do Believers forget the part which the Father has
   in their salvation. And yet He is the basis and prompter of it all.
   Remember, Beloved, that He who first of all chose you was no other than
   our Father who is in Heaven. And though our Lord Jesus Christ undertook
   your cause, yet it was because the Father, first of all, out of His
   great love, gave you to His Son. Forget not the Father's Grace and
   cease not to sing of His love--

   "'Twas with an everlasting love That God His o wn elect embraced Before
   He made the worlds above, Or earth on her huge columns placed. Long
   before the sun's refulgent ray Primeval shades of darkness drove, They
   on His sacred bosom lay, Loved with an everlasting love."

   2. The Savior then proceeds to inform us of a great transaction. He
   says that the Father gave His people to the Son and put them into the
   hands of Christ--the God-man Mediator. As Jesus is God, these people
   always were His own. But as Mediator, He received them from the hands
   of the Father. Here was the Father's condescension in noticing us at
   all and in bestowing us upon the Son--here was the Son's infinite mercy
   and compassion, in accepting such poor souls as we are at the Father's
   hands and counting us to be His precious jewels, His peculiar portion.
   The persons referred to as being given by the Father are not all men,
   although, it is true that the Father has delivered all things into
   Jesus' hands and He has power over all flesh.

   We must always interpret one passage of Scripture by another. And the
   thirty-ninth verse of this chapter very clearly interprets the
   thirty-seventh--"And this is the Father's will which has sent Me, that
   of all which He has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it
   up again at the last day." The given ones, it is clear, are by
   appointment delivered from being lost and appointed to a glorious
   resurrection which is not true of any but the chosen. In the tenth
   chapter we find the same explained thus in the twenty-seventh
   verse--"My sheep hear My voice and I know them, and they follow Me: and
   I give unto them eternal life. And they shall never perish, neither
   shall any man pluck them out of My hands. My Father, which gave them to
   Me, is greater than all. And no man is able to pluck them out of my
   Father's hands."

   And if this should not explain the matter sufficiently, we have it
   again in our Lord's prayer in the seventeenth chapter, sixth verse--"I
   have manifested Your name unto the men which You gave me out of the
   world: Yours they were and You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your
   word." So you see that the persons given were His own sheep. They are
   brought to know the voice of the Good Shepherd and to follow Him. They
   are in His hands and there they are safely kept beyond all fear of
   harm. Jesus manifests the Father's name unto them and they learn to
   keep the Father's word.

   This does not respect any gift of all men which the Father has made to
   the Son--though in a certain sense all men have been given to Christ in
   order that they may be the unconscious instruments of His Glory, though
   not saved by His redemption. They are, even as His enemies, compelled
   to do His pleasure, though they shall never be lifted up to the
   adoption of children, nor to the dignity of being Brethren of the Lord.

   We see, then, that there was a certain period when the eternal God gave
   into the hands of the Mediator a multitude which no man can number,
   whom He had chosen from among men to be His choice and peculiar
   treasure. The text speaks in the present tense. But then the
   thirty-eighth verse speaks in the past tense. And the passages we have
   been reading to you all have it in the past--therefore understand that
   the gift of the elect to Christ was performed in the past--before the
   skies were stretched abroad or the mountains lifted their heads to the
   clouds God had given a people to Christ.

   But the deed may well be said to be performed in the present, since
   with God there is no time and what He did yesterday, He does today, and
   will do forever. Moreover, in a certain sense Christ does receive from
   His Father's hand His people in time as well as in eternity--the Father
   giving by effectual calling in time, the very people whom once He gave
   in secret Covenant in eternity. We are, by the words of our text,
   admitted into one of the secrets of the Divine council chamber and
   rejoice as we perceive that the chosen ones belonging to the Father
   were transferred by Him into the hands of the Mediator.

   3. Further proceeding, Jesus assures us that this transaction in
   eternity involves a certain change in time. "All that the Father gives
   Me shall come to Me." They may be living in sin and they may continue
   so to do twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy years--but before
   their time shall come to die, they shall be brought to Christ! To come
   to Christ signifies to turn from sin and to trust Christ. Coming to
   Christ is a leaving of all false confidences, a renouncing of all love
   of sin and a looking to Jesus as the solitary pillar of our confidence
   and hope.

   Now every soul whom God the Father gave to Jesus must do this and this
   is the token by which the secretly chosen are known--they openly choose
   Christ because the Father has secretly chosen them. You can never know
   your election by any other means. That you are not one of His sheep
   will be proved by your continuance in unbelief. But if humbly and
   hopefully you come to Jesus and make Him all your salvation and your
   desire, let no doctrine of election alarm or keep you back--you are one
   of His, for this is the seal which He sets upon His sheep. In due time
   they hear His voice, are led by Him into the green pastures of Grace,
   follow Him through life and are brought by Him at last to the hilltops
   of Glory!--

   "There is a period known to God, When all His sheep, redeemed by blood,
   Shall leave the hateful ways of sin,
   Turn to the fold and enter in.
   At peace with Hell, with God at war,
   In sin's dark maze they wander far,
   Indulge their lusts and still go on
   As far from God as sheep can run.
   But see how Heaven's indulgent care
   Attends their wanderings here and there
   Still hard at heel wherever they stray,
   With pricking thorns to hedge their way.
   Glory to God, they never shall rove
   Beyond the limits of His love.
   Fenced with Jehovah'sshallsand wills,
   Firm as the everlasting hills
   The appointed time rolls on apace,
   Not to propose, but call by Grace,
   To change the heart, renew the will,
   And turn the feet to Zion's hill."

   4. Observe, yet further, that in the words of our text, Jesus hints at
   a power possessed by Him to constrain the wanderers to return. He says,
   "All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me." Oh, the power and
   majesty which rest in the words "shall come." He does not say they have
   power to come. He does not say they may come if they will, but they
   "shall come." There is no, "if," no "but," no "perhaps," no condition
   whatsoever! It is put down as an unconditional and absolute purpose of
   God and will of Christ that all whom the Father gave to Him shall come.
   "Well," says one, "but does Christ force any man to be saved?" I answer
   "No," in the sense in which the question is asked. No man was ever
   taken to Heaven by the ears or dragged there by the hair of his head!
   But, at the same time, the Lord Jesus does, by His messengers, His
   Word, and His Spirit, sweetly and graciously compel men to come in that
   they may eat of His marriage-supper.

   And this He does, mark you, not by any violation of the free will or
   free agency of man! God never treats man as though he were a brute. He
   does not drag him with cart ropes--He treats men as men. And when He
   binds them with cords, they are the cords of love and the bands of a
   man. I may exercise power over another's will and yet that other man's
   will may be perfectly free because the constraint is exercised in a
   manner accordant with the laws of the human mind. If I show a man that
   a certain line of action is much for his advantage, he feels bound to
   follow it, but he is perfectly free in so doing. If man's will were
   subdued or chained by some physical process--if man's heart should, for
   instance, be taken from him and be turned round by a manual
   operation--that would be altogether inconsistent with human freedom, or
   indeed, with human nature.

   And yet I think some few people imagine that we mean this when we talk
   of constraining influence and Divine Grace! We mean nothing of the
   kind! We mean that Jehovah Jesus knows how, by irresistible arguments
   addressed to the understanding--by mighty reasons appealing to the
   affections and by the mysterious influence of His Holy Spirit operating
   upon all the powers and passions of the soul--to subdue the whole man,
   that whereas it was once rebellious it becomes obedient! Whereas it
   stood stoutly against the Most High, it throws down the weapons of its
   rebellion and cries, "I yield! I yield! Subdued by Sovereign love and
   by the enlightenment which You have bestowed upon me, I yield myself to
   Your will!"

   The weapons are not carnal, but mighty, through God, to the pulling
   down of strongholds. They are the invincible artillery of the love of
   Christ and the sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God! Of this
   teaching no Arminian should complain when he remembers the strong
   expressions used in Wesley's hymns! Let me quote an instance--

   "O my God, what must I do?
   You alone the way can show.
   You can save me in this hour,
   I have neither will nor power!
   God, if over all You are
   Greater than my sinful heart,
   All Your power on me be shown,
   Take away the heart of stone.
   Take away my darling sin,
   Make me willing to be clean.
   Make me willing to receive
   All Your goodness waits to give!
   Force me, Lord, with all to part,
   Tear these idols from my heart!
   Now Your love almighty show,
   Make even me a creature new.
   Jesus, mighty to renew,
   Work in me to will and do.
   Turn my nature's rapid tide,
   Stem the torrent of my pride!
   Stop the whirlwind of my will,
   Speak and bid the sun standstill.
   Now Your love almighty show,
   Make even me a creature new.
   Arm of God, Your strength put on,
   Bow the heavens and come down!
   All my unbelief overthrow,
   Lay the aspiring mountain low!
   Conquer Your worst foe in me,
   Get Yourself the victory!
   Save the vilest of the race,
   Force me to be saved by Grace."

   There is an influence put forth by the Holy Spirit which makes men
   willing in the day of God's power. And every soul that is numbered in
   the Covenant of Grace shall. Let the devil do his worst and let the
   human will do its utmost and let temptations strain themselves to the
   last degree of intensity--they shall, I say, in obedience to Divine
   decree, be brought to the foot of the Cross, to cry, "What must I do to
   be saved?"

   5. And to conclude our remarks upon this first sentence, the Savior
   declares that there is no exception to this rule of Grace. He says,
   "All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me." Not some of them, but
   all! Not all but one or two, but every one! Each one in particular and
   the whole collectively. It will be found when the archangel's trumpet
   shall ring through earth and Heaven, that every soul whom God ordained
   to eternal life has attained that eternal life to God's praise and
   honor! And when the census shall be read of all the children of the
   living God, not one of the blood-bought and blood-washed shall be
   absent--they shall all come to Christ in Heaven as they all come to
   Christ on earth.

   Now, albeit that some stumble at this doctrine, here is the greatest
   possible comfort to the preacher of the Word. Day after day we proclaim
   our Master's Truth and yet to a great extent we have to cry--"Who has
   believed our report? And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?" So
   many are stony-hearted. So many resist the invitations of the Gospel.
   So many turn a deaf ear to the warnings of almighty mercy--what then?
   Have we sown in vain? Have we labored for nothing? No, verily, in no
   way! The purpose of God is certainly fulfilled in every jot and tittle
   and the Master's will is definitely and in every point accomplished!

   Therefore we labor with no broken heart and we preach with no coward
   spirit in this matter. You, O proud and haughty sinners, may resist
   Him. But if you will not come, others shall--you are bid to come to the
   wedding. And if you will not come, the highways and the hedges shall
   find Him guests. His table shall not be empty. Think not that the blood
   of Christ shall be shed in vain! You may count it an unholy thing, but
   there are myriads who shall be washed in it and who shall rejoice in
   its power to cleanse. You may put from you the kingdom of Heaven and
   count yourselves unworthy of it--if it is a "savor of death unto death"
   to you--yet it shall be a "savor of life unto life" to others!

   The great plans of Sovereign mercy shall not be thwarted by the enmity
   of man! Jehovah shall yet in the end get the victory. All ages shall
   crown His head with fresh honors when they see how, despite all the
   enmity of the human heart-- its treachery and its hardness--that His
   purpose did stand and He did all His pleasure and displayed the bounty
   of His Grace as He would, according to the good pleasure of His own
   will.

   You will see, then, that this first sentence, if we understand it at
   all, involves, first, the doctrine of election--there are some whom the
   Father gave to Christ. It involves, next, the doctrine of effectual
   calling--those who are given must and shall come--however stoutly they
   may set themselves against it, they shall be brought out of darkness
   into God's marvelous light, And it also teaches us, and here I leave
   the first sentence, the indispensable necessity of faith--for even
   those who are given to Christ are not saved except they come to Jesus.
   Even they must come, for there is no other way to Heaven but by the
   Door, Christ Jesus.

   I must not expect, whoever I may be, that I shall be saved by my
   morality! I must not reckon to enter Heaven by my integrity or my
   generosity! All that the Father gives to our Redeemer must come to Him.
   Therefore none can come to Heaven except they come to Christ. And it
   becomes indispensably requisite for princes and for peasants, for sages
   and for savages, for the polite and for the uneducated, for the most
   virtuous and the most vile to come just as they are and accept the
   mercy of God which is freely presented to them in the Person of Christ
   Jesus. And, mark, by this shall those be known whom God has
   chosen--that they do willingly and joyfully accept Christ Jesus and
   come to Him with simple and unfeigned faith, resting upon Him as all
   their salvation and all their desire!

   Some of you do not like this doctrine. Well, I cannot help that. I find
   it in the Scriptures and I preach it. There is the text--to me it means
   nothing if it does not mean what I have now stated. It is as plain and
   expressive as the Saxon language employed in it could possibly make it.
   Do not kick at the doctrine because you do not like it! If it is taught
   in Scripture, like it or not like it, receive it. Perhaps however, it
   does some people good to grow angry over a doctrine for they would
   never think of it at all if they did not! And while this doctrine, like
   an arrow in a wound, rankles and frets them, it nevertheless is the
   means of making them consider spiritual things and so they are brought
   to Jesus.

   I believe this is one of the virtues of this doctrine--that it excites
   people's prejudices and they grow vexed. But since they cannot get rid
   of it, it follows them--they dream of it, they argue about it--and at
   last there is a joint in the harness through which the good Word of the
   Gospel cuts its way and they come to receive Christ in the fullness and
   plenitude of His mercy.

   II. In the second sentence we have GRACE TRIUMPHANT IN ITS
   LIBERALITY--"Him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out."

   1. Please observe the liberality of the character--it is "him that
   comes"--there is no description given whatever, except, "him that
   comes." It means the rich man, the poor man, the great man, the obscure
   man, the moral man, the debauchee, those who have sunken into the worst
   of crimes and those who have mounted to the best of virtues. Those who
   are next akin to devils and those who seem, by the correctness of their
   lives to be somewhat like angels are all included-- "him, him"! "Him
   that comes!" "What him?" says John Bunyan. "Why," says he, answering
   his own question, "any him in all the world that comes to Christ shall
   be in no wise cast out."

   "Him that comes." To come, as I have explained before, is to leave
   something and to go to something. There is motion. We leave all other
   grounds of trust and we take Christ to be our solitary hope. We come to
   His blood to be washed, to His righteousness to be cleansed, to His
   wounds to be healed, to His life for life eternal and to His death for
   the death of our sins. We come to Jesus for everything! And the promise
   is that any man who comes, whoever he may be, shall find that he is not
   cast out. "But suppose," says one, "that the poor condemned wretch
   should come who has committed a foul and cruel murder?" Well, if he
   comes, he shall not be cast out!

   If in addition to murder, or without murder, he should have been guilty
   of uncleanness impossible to describe-- suppose he to have wallowed in
   it year after year and to have brought himself to such a state that he
   is scarcely fit to be touched with a pair of tongs! Suppose he to be
   such an outcast that he is only fit to be swept into some back corner
   in Hell. Well, what then? If he comes to Christ, he shall not be cast
   out! I like to put it in such a light that he who deems himself to have
   gone furthest into sin may yet see that this text sets a door wide open
   whereby he may come for mercy!

   It says, "him that comes," and this shuts out no comer. John Newton was
   a blasphemer of so gross a kind that even the sailors in the vessel in
   a storm said that they should never get to port with such a sinner as
   John Newton on board! But he came to Christ and was not cast out! He
   lived to preach the Word of God! John Bunyan was so foul a blasphemer
   that even a woman of the street, who passed him by and heard him swear,
   said that he was enough to corrupt the whole parish. And he was
   astonished that a woman of so bad a character should so rebuke him!

   John Bunyan came to Jesus and he was not cast out! He lived to have the
   honor of suffering for his Master and to be the winner of multitudes of
   souls. Saul of Tarsus had stained himself with the blood of saints! He
   was a very wolf after Christ's sheep! He was not satisfied with
   worrying them in his own land, so he obtained power to persecute them
   in Damascus. But when he fell upon his face and cried for mercy he was
   not cast out! Manasseh was blood-red with the murder of God's Prophets.
   It is said that he cut the Prophet Isaiah in two with a saw. And yet,
   when out of the low dungeon he cried for mercy, he was not cast out!

   So that any kind of "him," though he may have been a persecutor even
   unto blood--though he may have been exceedingly mad against God till he
   could not speak without blasphemies against the name of Christ--though
   he hated everything which is good and despised everything held precious
   by believing men and women--yet if he comes to Christ, he shall not be
   cast out! Every man, woman and child in this Tabernacle this morning is
   included in such a word as this, if he comes to Christ! That is the
   point--if you come to Christ, no matter what your past character may
   have been, nor yet what your present feelings may be, "him that comes
   to Me I will in no wise cast out." I thank God for so generous a
   liberality as that!

   2. Then the next point of liberality is in the coming. Please notice
   it. "Him that comes to Me." Here is no adjective to qualify it--here is
   no adverb to set out the manner. It is, "him that comes to Me." That is
   the point, "to Me." We must come to Jesus as crucified and bearing our
   sin. We must come to Christ as pleading before the Throne of God and
   see the acceptance of our prayers there. It is not coming to Baptism!
   It is not coming to the Lord's Supper! It is not coming to the Church.
   It is not coming to worship--it is coming to Christ! "Him that comes to
   Me."

   Take heed that you do not come elsewhere--for if you rest short of
   anything but Christ--you rest short of the promise. But, O Soul, if you
   build on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness. If you touch
   the hem of His garment. If you look out of self entirely to Him--then
   rest assured of this--there is no other qualification to your coming
   but that you come to HIM!

   Some come to Christ at once. The very first time they hear the Gospel,
   they lay hold of it and are saved. They are not cast out. Some are
   months in coming--they go from strength to strength in this matter and
   their faith is a thing of long growth. Well, they shall not be cast
   out! Some come running! Some come walking! Some come creeping on all
   fours! Some have to get others to carry them, as that man did who was
   borne of four! But so long as they do but come, He does not cast them
   out! Some feel as if all their bones were broken and they can only
   writhe into His Presence, as it were, wriggle themselves to the Mercy
   Seat all full of aches, pains, woes, doubts, fears, whispers,
   distrusts, bad habits and sins. But if they do but come, they shall not
   be cast out!

   One man comes with a long prayer. Another comes with nothing but two
   words. One comes with many tears. Another could not shed a tear if it
   would save his soul, but he groans. Another can scarcely groan, but his
   heart feels as if it would burst. One has intense conviction, another
   has very little of it. One is shaken over Hell's mouth, another is
   attracted by the beauties of the Savior. One has to be thundered at as
   from the top of Sinai, another is but beckoned and His willing heart
   runs to Calvary. But, however you come, Sinner, He will not cast you
   out if you come to Him--that is the point!

   Do not waste time questioning what your experience is, or raising the
   point of how you came or when you came-- for here it stands, "him that
   comes to Me"--not him that comes in this way, or that way, but, "him
   that comes to Me"!

   Oh, the liberality of this precious verse! It shuts me in, it does not
   shut you out poor Sinner--"him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast
   out."

   3. Observe the liberality of the time. "Him that comes." It does not
   say when. He may be seventy--if he comes he is not cast out! He may be
   but seven--and, thank God there have been many boys and girls who have
   come even at that age--but He will not cast them out! Your candle may
   be little more than a snuff, but He will not quench it. Or it may be
   but newly lit--He will accept either. The full-blown rose or the flower
   in the bud shall alike be received by His gracious hand!

   Some came to Jesus when He was on earth--He did not cast them out. A
   long file of sinners saved by Grace has been streaming up from the
   Cross to the Throne ever since then and not one of them has ever been
   rejected! We have fallen upon 1864, and the year is almost spent, yet,
   think not that we have come to the dregs of Christ's mercy! Do not
   imagine that, because time grows old, Christ's love grows decrepit! Ah,
   no! He will not cast us out in 1864 any more than He did the thief who
   looked to Him upon the Cross and found mercy that day! What a blessed
   thing it is that there is no limit as to time!

   I was remarking to myself the other day that the most of the
   conversions which occur in our place of worship are among new
   people--persons who come in once or twice and perhaps before they have
   heard a dozen sermons God blesses them. While those who have been
   hearing us for seven or eight years are not converted in anything like
   the same proportion. It is a very sad reflection, but still I couple
   with it this thought--"Well, if they have not come yet, still it is not
   too late. If they have been invited to come for seven, eight, nine,
   ten, twenty years--and oh, there are some of you who have heard the
   Gospel ever since you were children--yet it does not say that you shall
   be shut out because you come so late, but, "him that comes"!

   You may have turned a deaf ear until you are now growing gray. You may
   have despised Christ times without number--He waited to be
   gracious--with outstretched arms He bade His minister woo you to come
   to Him, but you would not come! But still, if now, by Grace, you are
   led to come, He will not cast you out! At the last moment of life, if
   you come, He will not cast you out. And now this morning--God make it
   an auspicious hour to you--come and try Him this hour, it is just
   twenty minutes past noon, but you will find if you come that He will
   not cast you out, for the gates of the City of Mercy are never shut!

   4. Further, notice that there is no limit as to the duration of the
   promise. I mean, He does not merely say, "I will not cast you out when
   you have come," but, "I will NEVER cast you out." The original reads,
   "I will not, not cast you out," or, "I will never, never cast you out."
   The text means that Christ will not at first reject a Believer. And
   that as He will not do it at first, so He will not to the last. If I
   come to Christ today, He will accept me. And He accepts me in that act
   forever--He will never cast me out!

   Suppose the Believer sins after coming? "If any man sin we have an
   Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous." Suppose that
   Believers backslide? "I will heal their backsliding, I will love them
   freely: for My anger is turned away from him." But Believers may fall
   under temptation. "God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be
   tempted above that you are able. But will, with the temptation, also
   make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it." But the
   Believer may fall into sin as David did! Yes, but He will "Purge them
   with hyssop and they shall be clean. He will wash them and they shall
   be whiter than snow,"

   From all their iniquities will He cleanse them--

   "Once in Christ, in Christ forever, Nothing from His love can sever,"
   and that doctrine this text teaches most expressly--"him that comes to
   Me I will never, never cast out." He will never suffer one who has once
   been grasped in His hands to be wrested from them! No member of
   Christ's body can ever be cut off, or else Christ would be mutilated.
   No sheep of His flock shall ever be torn by the lion--He will rend the
   lion and, as David did, He will take the lamb out of the jaws of the
   lion and out of the paws of the bear. "I give unto My sheep," says He,
   "eternal life. And they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck
   them out of My hands."

   What do you say to this, Sinner? Is not this a precious mercy--that if
   you come to Christ you do not come to One who will treat you well a
   month or two and then send you packing about your business, but will
   receive you and make you His child and you shall abide forever, no
   longer receiving the spirit of bondage again to fear, but the spirit of
   adoption whereby you shall cry, Abba, Father? Oh, the Grace of this
   passage! Would I had an angel's tongue to set it forth!

   5. Still we have not exhausted it. Something of the liberality of this
   passage is to be found in its certainty. "Him that comes to me I will
   in no wise cast out." It is not a hope as to whether Christ will accept
   you--it is a CERTAINITY! Oh, if there were only half a shadow of a hope
   that the Lord Jesus would have mercy upon such a poor worm as I am,
   would I not go into His Presence hoping against hope? If it were a case
   of sink or swim, yet, since I could lose nothing by trusting Him, I
   would gladly do it, as the hymn puts it--

   "I can but perish if I go! I am resolved to try! For if I stay away, I
   know I must forever die."

   But, dear Friends, we must not put it in that way, or at least, only
   for the sake of bringing out a thought--for there is no "but" about
   it--you cannot perish if you go! O, try at once and you will find that
   him that comes in no wise can be cast out! We sometimes sing--

   "Venture on Him, venture wholly, Let no other trust intrude," but there
   is no venture in the case--it is an absolute certainty. Merchants will
   often speculate at a high figure. But there is no speculation here. We
   drink the medicine which the physician gives us in the hope that it may
   cure--but this will cure--here is water that will quench your thirst!
   Here is a balm that will heal your wounds--"him that comes" He will
   receive--"He will in no wise cast out."

   What a hammer that word "no wise" is with which to smash your fears to
   pieces. "Perhaps," says one, "He will reject me because I do not repent
   enough"--"in no wise." "Perhaps He will reject me because I have been
   so long coming"--"in no wise." "But He will reject me because I do not
   pray aright"--"in no wise." You cannot mention any shape or form of a
   fear which this does not slay upon the spot--"I will in no wise cast
   out." I say again, I wish I had an angel's tongue to put the liberality
   of this before you. The devil, I know, will be suggesting twenty
   reasons why you should not come--let this one reason why you should
   come be enough to answer all of his--that Jesus says, "I will in no
   wise cast out him that comes."

   6. I must conclude by observing that there is great liberality in the
   text, if you notice its personality. Reading over this verse carefully
   I observed that in the first sentence, where everything was special,
   Jesus used a large word and He said, "All that the Father gives Me
   shall come." But in the second sentence, which is general, He uses a
   little word, a word which can mean only one and He says "him." There is
   a personality here--"him that comes." It does not say they that come,
   but "him that comes." Why? Why, because sinners want personal comfort!
   They need something that will suit their case. Do you see, Sinner, He
   does not take men in the lump, but He picks you out as if you were the
   only sinner in the world! He says to you, "him that comes to Me I will
   in no wise cast out"!

   Had he put it in the plural, you might say, "Ah, but He did not think
   of me." But now He has put it so that it just fits your case. This is
   no medicine in the bottle of which many may drink, but here is a glass
   set for you! It is not a cordial which may be passed round the table,
   but it is put at your place! Drink and be satisfied--"him that comes."
   Lord, does "him" mean me?" Yes, it means you, if you will come. Come
   now! Put your trust in Jesus. What do you say? I hope the Spirit is
   speaking to you in these words of mine! And if He speaks to you as I
   speak to you, then shall it be well with you. Sinner, come!

   There is a dying Savior! He died in the place of sinners. In the place
   of what sinners? Why, of all sinners who trust Him. Will you trust Him?
   Is it a hard thing to trust God to save you? To trust God who became
   man and so proved His love to you? To trust Him? "Why," says one, "that
   is simple enough," but that is all the plan of salvation. When I am
   preaching from such a text as this I feel as if I have no scope for
   metaphors and figures and illustrations--I do not need any--because
   this saving Truth of God must always he proclaimed as plainly as
   possible! And then if souls are saved by it, it is not the excellency
   of words, but the Truth itself which shall get the honor.

   Now, do you see it, Soul? If you do, I am content--if you trust Christ
   to save you, you shall not be cast out! You have come to Him! Your
   coming to Him proves that the Father gave you to Him! You are saved!
   You are one of His chosen! You shall never be cast out! Your Heaven is
   secure! You shall sit at the right hand of God and sing the new song,
   as surely as they do now, who, white-robed, are hymning the Redeemer's
   praise! This is not an affair of months and weeks, is it? It does not
   need a moment--to look, is the work of an instant. But the moment that
   faith is exercised, perfect pardon is given! There is no sin in God's
   book against a soul that trusts Christ and there never can be--

   "There's pardon for transgressions past,
   It matters not how black their cast!
   And, O my Soul, with wonder view,
   For sins to come, here's pardon too."

   What? Are there none who will accept this? Are there none here who say,
   "I will trust my soul in Jesus' hands"? What? Will you build on your
   own righteousness? Ah, Fools! To pile up the sand which the next tide
   must sweep away! What? Do you despise the mercy of my God? Will you
   turn away from the bleeding wounds of His own dear Son? What? Is
   forgiveness not worth your having? Is God's free mercy a thing to be
   scoffed at? O Heavens, hear and be astonished! O Earth, hear and be
   amazed! God sends the Gospel unto men, but they refuse it! That Gospel
   says unto them, "Come now and let us reason together, says the Lord:
   though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though
   they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool."

   But though God calls, they refuse and will have none of His Words! May
   His mighty Spirit come and make a difference in some of you and bring
   you now to the foot of the Savior's Cross to look up! Do nothing else
   but look up! And looking there you shall never perish, but have eternal
   life! May the Master bless these words, feeble of themselves and only
   mighty because of the Truth they convey, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

                The Centurion--Or An Exhortation To The Virtuous

   A SERMON DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE,
   NEWINGTON.

   "And when they came to Jesus, they besought Him instantly, saying, That
   he was worthy for whom He should do this: for he loves our nation and
   he has built us a synagogue. Then Jesus went with them. And when He was
   now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying
   unto Him, Lord, trouble not Yourself: for I am not worthy that You
   should enter under my roof: why neither thought I myself worthy to come
   unto You: but say in a word and my servant shall be healed. For I also
   am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers and I say unto
   one, Go and he goes. And to another, Come and he comes. And to my
   servant, Do this and he does it. When Jesus heard these things, He
   marveled at him and turned Him about and said unto the people that
   followed Him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not
   in Israel." Luke 7:4-9.

   THIS Centurion certainly had a high reputation. Two features of
   character blend in him which do not often meet in such graceful
   harmony. He won the high opinion of others and yet he held a low
   estimation of himself. There are some who think little of themselves.
   And they are quite correct in their feelings as all the world would
   endorse the estimate of their littleness. Others there are who think
   great things of themselves--but the more they are known the less they
   are praised--and the higher they carry their heads the more the world
   laughs them to scorn!

   Nor is it unusual for men to think great things of themselves because
   the world commends or flatters them. They robe themselves with pride
   and cloak themselves with vanity because they have by some means,
   either rightly or wrongly, won the good opinion of others. There are
   very few who have the happy combination of the text. The elders say of
   the centurion that he is worthy. But he says of himself, "Lord, I am
   not worthy!" They commend him for building God a house. But he thinks
   that he is not worthy that Christ should come under the roof of his
   house. They plead his merit. But he pleads his demerit.

   Thus he appeals to the power of Christ apart from anything that he felt
   in himself or thought of himself. O that you and I might have this
   blessed combination in ourselves! To win the high opinion of others, so
   far as it can be gained by integrity, by uprightness and by decision of
   character and yet at the same time to walk humbly with our God! Now
   there are three things I shall speak about tonight and may God make
   them profitable. First, here is a high character. Secondly, here is
   deep humility. And, thirdly, here is, notwithstanding that deep
   humility, a very mighty faith.

   I. To begin, then, dear Friends, here is A HIGH CHARACTER. Let us
   thoroughly appreciate it and give it a full measure of commendation.
   When preaching Jesus Christ to the chief of sinners, we have sometimes
   half dreamed that some who are moral and upright might think themselves
   excluded--they ought not to think so, nor is it fair for them to draw
   such an inference. We have heard the whisper of some who have said they
   could almost wish that they had been more abandoned and dissolute in
   the days of their unregeneracy so they might have a deeper repentance
   and be witnesses of a more palpable and thorough change and that they
   might never have cause to doubt of the triumph of Grace in their
   experience!

   We have even heard some say, "I could have wished that I had groveled
   in the very mire of sin--not that I love it-- on the contrary, I loathe
   it. But because had I then to be rescued from such a course of life,
   the change would be so manifest and apparent that I should never dare
   to ask myself whether I was a changed man or not. I should feel it and
   see it in my daily course and conversation." Dear Friends, if anything
   we have ever said should have led you into this mistake we are sorry
   for it--it was never our intention. While we would open the gates of
   mercy so wide that the greatest blas- phemer, the most unchaste and the
   most debauched may not be without hope--yet we never want to shut those
   gates in the face of such as have been brought up in a godly
   manner--those who through the Providence of God and the checks of
   education have been kept from the grosser vices.

   On the contrary, we thought that when we opened it for the worst there
   would be room for the best! And if Noah's ark took in the unclean,
   certainly the clean would not be afraid to enter. If Jesus Christ was
   able to cure those who were far gone in sickness, you might infer that
   He would certainly be able to heal those who, though they were sick,
   might not be so far advanced in disease! Besides, a little reflection
   may suggest to you that the penitence of contrite Believers is not
   regulated by the extent of their crimes against what you call the moral
   code. It is one thing to estimate sin by its apparent turpitude and
   another and an infinitely better thing to have the eyes of the
   understanding enlightened--to see sin in its infinite malignity as it
   appears in the light of heavenly purity and perfection which proceeds
   from the Throne of God, or as it is reflected from Mount Calvary where
   the amazing Sacrifice of Christ was offered.

   What? Do you think the whitewashed sepulcher of a Pharisee's heart is
   less loathsome to the Almighty than the open pollution of a Magdalene's
   life? Or, in the matter of experience, could the recollection of a
   thousand debaucheries give such a melting sense of contrition as a
   sight of the Crucified One? O Friends, let me remind you of the words
   of Jesus, "When He"--the Spirit of Truth--"is come, He will reprove the
   world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment: of sin, because they
   believe not on Me."

   That one sin of unbelief is such a concentration of all wickedness that
   it could outweigh the crimes of Sodom and Gomorrah and make them more
   excusable in the Day of Judgment than the men of Capernaum who saw the
   mighty works of Christ and did not repent! That one sin of unbelief is
   so heinous that the groans of the whole creation were but pitiful sighs
   to deplore it! And rivers of tears were but a weak tribute to lament
   it. However, as mistakes do arise and misapprehensions will take place,
   let us have a few words concerning a high character in the sight of
   men. Such a character among your fellow creatures may be gained in any
   situation.

   The centurion was a soldier--a profession of life not altogether the
   most favorable for moral excellence--though there have been in the army
   some of the brightest saints that ever lived. He was a soldier,
   moreover, in a foreign country--not the place where he was likely to
   win esteem. He was there as one of the representatives of a power which
   had conquered Judea and had treated it with great cruelty. Yet,
   notwithstanding the prejudices of race and nationality, this man's
   kindness of disposition and goodness of conduct had won for him the
   esteem of others.

   Moreover, being a commander of soldiers, he, naturally, would be blamed
   for every act of violence committed by his soldiers. Whatever might be
   done by his hundred men would be laid to the captain, so that his was a
   condition of peculiar difficulty and yet, notwithstanding this, the
   elders said, "He is worthy." Let none of you despair! Wherever you may
   be placed, a noble character may be earned. You may serve God in the
   most menial capacity but you may compel your very foes to admit your
   excellence! You may stand without blame before men and you may walk so
   uprightly before God that those who watch for your stumbling may bite
   their lips with disappointment--while they shall not have a single word
   to say against you except it is about the religion of your God and
   King.

   Let no man, wherever he may be thrown--though he is surrounded by those
   who tempt him--despair, especially if the Grace of God is in him. Let
   him pray like Joab that he may have favor in the eyes of his Master and
   expect to win it. This centurion must have been a man of sterling
   worth. He was not merely quiet and inoffensive like some men who are as
   dull as they are harmless. Though a high character may be won, it
   cannot be won without being earned. Men do not get character among
   their fellows by indolence and listlessness, or by pretensions and
   talk. Action! Action!--this is what the world wants!

   And there is more truth than we have dreamed of in Nelson's
   opinion--"England expects every man to do his duty." Certainly men will
   not speak well of you unless you do well. This centurion did so, for
   you will observe that they said he was worthy--which must have
   signified that he was just in his dealings and generous in his
   habits--or they would not have thought him worthy. It would appear,
   too, that his private temperament as well as his public spirit
   contributed to the estimation in which he was held. You will notice in
   the circumstances which bring him before us, how his tender feelings
   and his intense anxiety were drawn out on behalf, not of a child, but
   of a servant--perhaps of a slave!

   And then we might have thought it had been enough to have said that the
   man was highly valued by his master--but the expression is one of
   fondness--he was, "dear unto him." The fidelity of the servant may be
   implied, but it is the amiability of the master which is most prominent
   and chiefly arrests our attention. Nor need we overlook the fact that
   Matthew lays an emphasis upon the servant being, "at home," under his
   master's roof. We know that the Romans were not remarkable for the
   kindness they showed to their dependants--often they were merely looked
   upon as slaves.

   Why, in our own days and in the midst of our boasted civilization, when
   Christianity has exerted a salutary influence upon all our social
   relations, I suppose it is not uncommon for a domestic servant to go
   home to her parents' house in the case of sickness. It is not every
   good man among us, I fear, whose gentleness would equal that of the
   centurion in the love which he bears to his servant and the comfort he
   provided for him in his own house!

   Next to this you will observe his generosity. It is not, my dear
   Friends, by occasional deeds of showy luster but by the habitual
   practice of lovely virtues that a worthy character is built up. A
   thousand kindnesses may be nestling beneath the soil like the
   many-fibred root of a gigantic tree, when it is said, "He loves our
   nation," and then the conspicuous fruit appears in its season--"He has
   built us a synagogue." This example of liberality is spoken of as a
   mere supplement. The Jewish elders do not say, "He loves our nation"
   for--but they say, "he loves our nation and he has built us a
   synagogue." This last was a visible token of innumerable good offices
   which had already won their secret esteem before it bloomed in an open
   reputation.

   I have heard all sorts of men praised and I have noted the qualities
   which win the plaudits of the crowd. Even the high and haughty have
   some to praise them. But I think I never heard a niggardly man praised,
   or one who was perpetually guilty of meanness. Let him have whatever
   virtues he may, if he lack liberality, few, if any, will speak well of
   him. Let me commend liberality to the Christian--in all his actions and
   benevolence--in all his thoughts. This may sound commonplace, but I am
   persuaded that the little tricks in trade--those little savings of the
   pence, those sharp dealings--are just the things which bring religion
   into disrepute. It were infinitely better that the Christian should pay
   too much than too little. He had better be blamed for an excess of
   generosity than take credit to himself for a rigid stinginess.

   Rather let him become, now and then, the dupe of an imposter than shut
   up the heart of his compassion against his fellow man. I would seek,
   Christian man, to win a noble character. I cannot see how you can do so
   except you should put generosity into the scale and enroll it in the
   list of your virtues. A high character, when earned, is very useful. I
   am saying this because some might imagine that in the preaching of the
   Gospel we put the base and the wicked before those who have walked
   uprightly. A good character, a good reputation in the esteem of men,
   when earned, may win for us as it did for this centurion, kind
   thoughts, kind words, kind acts, kind prayers.

   There is many a man who will pray for you if he sees you walk
   uprightly. Yes, and your very adversary who would otherwise have cursed
   you, will find the curse trembling on his tongue. Though he would
   gladly scorn, yet does he bate his breath, abashed at your
   excellencies. Let the Christian labor so to live that he shall not lack
   a friend. "Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of
   unrighteousness," is one of Christ's own precepts. If to stoop, to
   cringe, to lie, wins you friends, do not do it! But if with uprightness
   before God you can still mingle such affection and such generosity
   towards men that you shall win their support, do it, I pray you. The
   time may come when their sympathy shall befriend you.

   But remember, and here I close this point, however good your character
   or however excellent your reputation, not one word of this is ever to
   be mentioned before the Throne of the Most High. Job could say when he
   was talking with his adversaries, "I am not wicked." He could boast in
   his excellencies, as he did. But in the Presence of God how he changed
   his note--"Now my eyes see You: why I abhor myself and repent in dust
   and ashes." Coming before the Lord, we must all come as sinners. When
   on your knees you have nothing to boast of more than the worst rogue or
   the man who has sinned against his country's laws. There, at the foot
   of the Cross, one needs the cleansing blood as much as the other. At
   mercy's gate we must alike knock and we must be fed by the same
   generous hand. There are no degrees here--we enter by the same door. We
   come to the same Savior.

   And we shall ultimately--Glory be to His name!--sit together in the
   same Heaven whether we have earned a good reputation or not! Whether we
   have crept into Heaven, as the thief did at the eleventh hour, or
   through forty and five years of public service earned the applause of
   men, as did Caleb the son of Jephunneh--

   "Nothing in my hand I bring, Simply to Your Cross I cling," must be the
   common footing and the like confession of both before the God of Mercy.
   Thus much by way of tribute to the high character of the centurion and
   the high motives to emulate it.

   II. Secondly, in the centurion we see coupled with this high and noble
   repute, DEEP HUMILIATION OF SOUL. "I am not worthy that You should
   enter under my roof." Humility, then, it appears, may exist in any
   condition. There are some men who are too mean to be humble. Do you
   understand me? They are too crouching, crawling, sneaky and abject to
   be humble. When they use humble words, they disgrace the words they
   use! You perceive at once that it is rather a rise than a stoop for
   them to be humble.

   How could it be otherwise? It certainly is not for the least vermin
   that creep the earth to talk about humility. They must be low--it is
   their proper place. Such the creatures who cringe and fawn--"Whatever
   you please, Sir," "Yes," "No," in the same breath. They have not a soul
   within them that would be worth the notice of a sparrow hawk. They are
   too little to be worthy of observation yet they say they are humble! A
   man, to be humble, needs to have a soul--to stoop, you must have some
   elevation to stoop from. You must have some real excellence within you
   before you can really understand what it is to renounce merit.

   Had the centurion been unworthy, had he been ungenerous and an
   oppressor, he would have spoken the truth when he said, "I am not
   worthy that You should enter under my roof." But there would have been
   no true humility in what he said. It was because of his excellence, as
   acknowledged by others, that he could be humble in the modesty of his
   opinion of himself. We have heard of a certain monk who, professing to
   be humble, said he had broken all God's Commandments. He said he was
   the greatest sinner in the world--he was as bad as Judas. Somebody
   said, "Why tell us that? We have all of us thought that a long time!"
   Straightway the holy man grew red in the face and struck the accuser
   and asked him what he had ever done to deserve such an accusation!

   We know some of that kind--they will use the words of humility, appear
   very contrite and perhaps even at Prayer Meetings you would think them
   the meekest and most broken-hearted of men--but if you were to take
   them at their word, straightway they would tell you they use the
   language as some ecclesiastical personages do, in a non-natural sense!
   They do not quite mean what they were supposed to mean, but something
   very different. That is not humility--it is a kind of mock-modesty
   which hankers after applause and holds out specious words as a bait for
   the trap of approbation.

   Our centurion was truly humble. This a man may be, though possessing
   the highest excellence and standing in the most eminent position. I
   believe, in my soul, that no man had truer humility in him than John
   Knox and yet John Knox never cringed and never bowed. When Luther dared
   the thunders of the Vatican, no doubt many said how self-conceited,
   egotistical and proud he was. But for all that, God knew how humbly
   Martin Luther walked with Him. When Athana-sius stood up and said, "I,
   Athanasius, against the world," it had the ring of pride about it--but
   there was true and sound humility before God in it--because he seemed
   to say, "What am I? Not worthy of taking care of. And therefore I do
   not use the deceptions of cowardice for my own personal safety. Let the
   world do what it will to me, God's Truth is infinitely more precious
   than I am and so I give myself up as an offering upon its altar."

   True humility will agree with the highest chivalry in maintaining
   Divine Truth and with the boldest assertion of what one knows in his
   own conscience to be true. Though it may be the lot of Christians to be
   thought proud, let it never be true or capable of being substantiated
   concerning them. The centurion, though worthy, was still humble. His
   friends and neighbors gauged him by what he said and what he did. He
   asked them to go for him, seeing he was not worthy. Then, finding that
   they asked too great a gift, he comes to stop them--"I am not worthy
   that You should enter under my roof."

   You need not tell people that you are humble. You have no occasion to
   advertise that you have genuine humility-- let it discover itself as
   spice does, by its perfume--or as fire, by its burning. If you live
   near to God and if your humility is of the right kind it will tell its
   own tale before long. But the place where humility does speak out is at
   the Throne of Grace. Beloved, there are some things we would confess of
   ourselves before God which we would not confess before men. There is an
   attitude of prostration at the Throne of the Most High which will never
   be so gracefully or graciously taken as by that man who would spurn to
   prostrate himself before his fellows.

   That is not true humility which bends the knee at the tyrant's
   throne--that is true humility which, having bearded the tyrant to his
   face, goes down on its knees before the God of Heaven--bold as a lion
   before men, but meek as a lamb before Jehovah! The true man, whom God
   approves, will not--dares not--turn aside the love he bears his
   sovereign Lord when he faces men. But when he is alone with his Maker
   he veils his face with something better than the wings of angels!

   Wrapped all over with the blood and righteousness of Jesus Christ, he
   rejoices with fear and trembling that he is justified from all things.
   Yet, conscious of the total defilement of his nature, with deep
   prostration of soul he uses the leper's cry, "Unclean! Unclean!
   Unclean!" Thus does he fix all his hope upon that cleansing blood and
   depends alone on that meritorious obedience of Jesus upon which every
   sanctified Believer exclusively relies. Seek, then, as much as lies in
   you, that high character which the Christian should maintain among men.
   But with it always blend that true humility which comes of the Spirit
   of God and ever behooves us in the Presence of the Lord.

   III. The main thing I am aiming at, because, after all, the most
   practical, lies in my third point. However deep our humility, however
   conscious we may be of our own undeservedness, WE SHOULD NEVER DIMINISH
   OUR FAITH IN GOD. Observe the confession--"I am not worthy that You
   should enter under my roof." What then will be the inference? "I fear,
   therefore, my servant will not be healed"? No, no! But--"Say in a Word
   and my servant shall be healed"!

   It is all a mistake that great faith implies pride. Beloved, the
   greater the faith, the deeper the humility. These are brothers, not
   foes. The more the Glories of God strike your eyes, the humbler you
   will lie in conscious abasement but the higher you will rise in
   importunate prayer! Let us take this principle and endeavor to apply it
   to a few cases. I say that a deep sense of our own nothingness is not
   to prevent our having strong faith. We will take a few instances. There
   is a minister here who has been preaching the Word of God--he has so
   proclaimed it that God has been pleased to own it in some degree.

   But, it may be, he has stirred up strife. He has caused, I know not
   what amount of turmoil and of noise, as the faithful servant of God
   will in his measure. And now, coming before God, he is asking that a
   greater blessing than ever may rest upon his labors. But something
   checks his tongue. He remembers his many infirmities. He remembers,
   perhaps, how slack he is in his private devotions and how cold he is in
   his pleading with the sons of men. He has before Him the promise, "My
   Word shall not return unto Me void." But for all that, he is so
   conscious that he does not deserve the honor of being useful that he is
   half afraid to pray as he should pray and to believe as he should
   believe.

   Dear Brother, may I press upon you the case of the centurion? It is
   right for you--it is right for me, to say, "Lord, I am not worthy to be
   made the spiritual parent of one immortal soul." It is right for me to
   feel that it is too great an honor to be permitted to preach the Truth
   of God at all and almost too high a thing for such a sinner to have any
   jewels to present to the Redeemer to fix in His crown! But, oh, we must
   not from this infer that He will not fulfill His promise to us and hear
   our prayers! "Lord, speak in a Word and, feeble though the instrument
   may be, the congregation shall be blessed! Say but the Word and the
   marvelous testimony, though marred with a thousand imperfections, shall
   yet be 'quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword.' "

   Let this comfort and cheer any desponding pastor--let him take heart
   from this and learn that it is not himself to whom he is look to, but
   that he is to look to God. And that it is not his own arm upon which he
   is to depend, but the promise of God and the strong arm of the Most
   High. Or, am I addressing some Brother or Sister in a somewhat similar
   perplexity of mind? In your private life, dear Friend, you have laid
   upon your heart some of your relatives and neighbors who are very dear
   to you.

   Or perhaps, you teach a class in the Sunday school, or possibly you
   have a larger class of adults and sometimes Satan will be very busy
   with you. The more useful you are, the more busy he will be. And he
   will say to you, "What are you, that you should ever hope to see
   conversions? Other men and women have had them, but they were better
   than you are-- they had more talent. They had more ability. They served
   God better. And God gave them a greater reward. You must not hope to
   see your children saved! You cannot expect it. How should such teaching
   as yours ever be useful?"

   Friend, you are right in saying, "Lord, I am not worthy that you should
   enter under my roof." The more you can feel that, the more hopeful
   shall I be of your success! You are right in feeling that David is not
   fit to meet the giant and that the stones out of the brook are scarcely
   fit weapons for such a warfare. But, oh, do not push the right into a
   wrong! Do not, therefore, mistrust your God! No matter what a fool you
   may be--God has confused wise things by the foolish long before now. No
   matter how weak you are--God has brought down the mighty by weak
   instrumentalities often enough before this time!

   Have hope in Him and tonight in your prayers, when you have made your
   confessions, do not let your faith fail you, but say, "Lord, say in a
   Word and my class shall be blessed! Say in a Word and those stubborn
   boys and girls, those to whom I have talked so often, who seem to be
   none the better--shall be saved." Have faith in God, beloved fellow
   work- ers! The result of all, under God, must rest with your faith! If
   you believe for little success, you shall have little success. But if
   you can believe for great things and expect great things, you shall
   certainly find your Master's Words fulfilling your desire!

   Do I now also address parents here who have been praying for their
   children? Or a husband who has been pleading for his wife? Or a wife
   who has been making intercession for her husband? God only knows what
   heart-rending prayers are often heard in families where only a part is
   saved! Ah, what grief is it to a truly godly father to see his sons and
   daughters still heirs of wrath! And what a pang to know that the
   partner of your bosom must be separated from you forever by the stroke
   of death! I marvel not that you pray for your friends! Should I not
   marvel at you if you did not? And now, when you have been praying
   lately, a sense of your unworthiness has almost stopped you. And
   though, perhaps, there has been no public sin about you--before others
   you could have defended yourself--you have said in private, "Lord, I am
   not worthy of this blessing."

   You have said, "Lord, my children are not saved because my example is
   not as good as it should be. My conversation is not as upright as it
   should be." You have felt, as I have sometimes, that there was no
   creature in the whole world so little and no man loved of God in all
   the world that was so great a wonder of ingratitude as you are. I say
   it is right that you should feel this--but do not let this stop your
   prayers! Offer your request! Depend upon the blood of Christ for its
   plea and upon the intercession of Christ for its prevalence! Do not be
   afraid!

   An evil hand drops a letter into the post office, but the blackness of
   that hand will not hinder the dispatch of it. There is a stamp upon it
   and it will go. And your black hand drops a prayer before Christ's
   feet, but that black hand will not stop its being heard, for there is a
   stamp upon it--Jehovah Jesus' blood! It may be blotted and misspelled
   and there may be many blurs all over it, but do not be afraid, for God
   knows His Son's signature and that will give a worth to your prayers.
   It is the bloody signature of Him whose hand was nailed to the Cross
   that will carry the day with God. Therefore do not, I pray you, give
   place to fear--your prayers shall return into your bosom with an answer
   of peace.

   "Well, but," says one, "I have prayed so long." Ah, Brother, do not,
   "limit the Holy One of Israel." Sister, do not let your doubts prevail.
   Renew your appeal to Jesus, "Say in a Word--only say one Word." It is
   all done if He shall speak! Darkness fled before Him in the primeval
   chaos and order followed confusion. Do you think, if He shall say, "Let
   there be light" in a dark heart, that there shall not be light there?
   Angels fly at His bidding--at His Presence the rocks melt and the hills
   dissolve--Sinai is altogether on a smoke. And when He comes forth,
   dressed in the robes of salvation, there are no impossibilities with
   Him. He can win and conquer to your heart's best desire. Therefore be
   humble, but be not unbelieving.

   By your leave, I shall now turn the principle of my text to an account
   in another way. Concerning yourselves, Friends, what are the mercies
   which you want? If every man could write down his own peculiar prayer,
   what a variety we should have upon the paper as it just went round the
   front row of that gallery. If it went round to all, it would not be
   like Jeremiah's roll, written within and without with lamentations, but
   it would be filled within and without with many petitions! But now just
   imagine what your own case is and the case of others and let us apply
   this principle to it--we are utterly unworthy to obtain the temporal or
   spiritual mercy which, it may be, we are now seeking--we may feel this,
   but in asking anything for ourselves we must still ask in faith in
   God--in His promise and in His Grace--and we shall prevail.

   This blessed principle may be turned to all sorts of uses. Whatever
   your desire may be, only believe and it shall be granted unto you if it
   is a desire in accordance with His will and in accordance with the
   promises of His Word--or else God's Word is not true. Be humble about
   it, but do not be doubtful about it. The case I have in my mind's eye
   is this-- there is an unsaved soul here tonight. It happens to be one
   whose character has been morally admirable. Nobody finds any fault with
   you, and, as I said before, you almost wish they could! You cannot
   feel, as some do, the terrors of the Lord. Your heart is not broken
   with conviction as the hearts of some are, but there is this desire in
   it, "Lord, save me, or I perish!"

   Now, dear Friend, it is well that you should feel that there is nothing
   in you to commend you to Christ. I am glad that you feel this. Though
   before the eyes of men and even of your own parents there is nothing
   which can cause you a blush, I am glad that you feel that before God
   you have nothing whatever to boast of. I think I see you now--you are
   saying, "My Church goings, my Chapel goings, I do not trust in them--I
   would not give up attendance at the means of

   Grace, but, Sir, I have no reliance upon all this. As for my Baptism,
   or my confirmation, or my taking the sacrament, I know that all this
   has nothing whatever in it which can save my soul. And though I love
   God's ordinances, yet I cannot trust in them. Sir, I have fed the poor.
   I have taught the ignorant. In my measure I would do anything to assist
   those who need my aid. But I do solemnly renounce all this as a ground
   of trust. I have nothing of which to glory."

   Well now, dear Friend, there remains only one thing to give you perfect
   peace tonight! And may the Master give you that one thing! Lift up this
   prayer to Him, "Say in a Word and I shall be made whole." Christ can do
   it! The offering is made. The precious blood is spilt. There is an
   almighty efficacy in it--He can put away your sin. Christ lives to
   intercede before the Throne and "is able also to save them to the
   uttermost that come unto God by Him." Doubt not, then, but now,
   trusting yourself with Jesus Christ, remember you are saved!

   I am not now looking for the vilest of the vile. How many times have we
   said from this place that none are excluded? None but those who exclude
   themselves. No mountains of sin nor height of vileness can shut a man
   out of Heaven if he believes in Jesus--but just now we are after you. I
   know you are a numerous class. You are, in some respects, our dear
   Friends. And though not of us, you hover round us. If there is anything
   to be done for the cause of God, you are, perhaps, first in it. And yet
   you, yourselves, are not saved! I cannot bear the thought of your being
   cast away--to be so near the gates of Heaven and yet to be shut out
   after all! Why should it be? The voice speaks to you now--the Spirit of
   the living God speaks through that voice.

   There is life in a look for you as well as for the chief of sinners!
   Without the strong convictions, without the terrors of conscience,
   without a sense of any aggravated crimes--if you rest on Jesus, you are
   saved! There is no amount of sin specified there. You are lost in the
   Fall--wholly lost--even if you had no sin of your own. But your own
   actual sin has irretrievably ruined you apart from the Grace of Christ.
   You know this and to an extent you feel it. You will feel it all the
   more when you have believed in Jesus. But now the one message of mercy
   is, "Believe and you shall live." I feel as if I cannot get at you. My
   soul will not go out as I desire and yet you know that I am talking
   about you and about your case.

   When we are firing our shots at sin we hardly ever strike you. You have
   become so used to our appeals that there seems no likelihood of our
   getting at you. Oh, there are some of you whom I would not find fault
   with if I could. You make your mother glad with your industry. You make
   your sister's heart rejoice at your many virtues. But yet there is one
   thing which you lack! Remember that when the strength of a chain is to
   be measured, it is measured at its one weakest link. If you have that
   one weak link, the vital union is snapped.

   You may have anything and everything else, but you will be only a child
   of nature and not a living son! I am only telling you over and over
   Truths of God which you have known for many years. You will not dispute
   these things. And sometimes you feel an earnestness about your eternal
   portion, though, like so many others, you are putting off and putting
   off. But death will not put off! The Judgment Day will not be postponed
   for you. O may you be brought in now! What a happy Church we should be
   if such as you should be brought in. We rejoice over the chief of
   sinners--we make the place ring when the prodigals come in. But elder
   Brother, why will you not come in?

   You who have not been standing all the day in the market idle, but only
   the first hour--say not, no man has hired you. O come in, that the
   house of mercy may be filled! God grant the desire of our hearts and to
   His name shall be the praise. Amen and Amen.

                    A Solemn Enquiry Concerning Our Families

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 20, 1864, BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT
   THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE NEWINGTON.

   "And the men said unto Lot, have you here any besides? Son-in-law and
   your sons, and your daughters and whatever you ha ve in the city, bring
   them out of this place."

   Genesis 19:12.

   THE angelic messengers of mercy were not only earnest to bring Lot out
   of the city, but in their great kindness they reminded him of an
   important matter which, in the alarm of the tumult without and in the
   surprise of their fearful tidings, he might possibly have forgotten.
   They suggested to his distracted heart a loving care for his relatives
   and friends. His wife and his two daughters were already with him in
   the house, but he had two sons-in-law to whom his daughters were
   espoused, if not married. And the angels suggest to him to make an
   effort to rescue these, also, from the destruction which awaited the
   filthy city.

   In the perturbation of mind which is so usual in the renewed heart at
   first, it is no marvel if a man should be so taken up with thoughts of
   his own safety as to forget the welfare of others. Therefore I see a
   wisdom in the saying of the Apostle Paul to the trembling jailer,
   "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved, and your
   house." The jailer's question was personal and confined to
   himself--"Sirs, what must I do to be saved?" In this we judge him
   not--for his own conversion must be the object of the deepest and most
   earnest thoughts of a convicted sinner. But Paul's answer was large and
   liberal--"You shall be saved, and your house."

   There may be some here who have but lately passed from darkness to
   light. In the fear lest you should be mistaken, or in the joy of your
   new-found comfort, it may be you have scarcely begun to think of your
   wife, your children, or your relatives--is it not time to begin at
   once? Let this text come, this morning, fresh out of Holy Scripture as
   though it dropped anew from the angel's tongue--"Have you here any
   besides?" You are yourself privileged by Sovereign Mercy and singled
   out for safety--have you here in the land of sin any besides? Have you
   not some unconverted kinsfolk, some unsaved relative, some who are
   written in your family register but who are not written in the Lamb's
   Book of Life?

   Come, Friend, think about this and give heed to the question, "Have you
   here any besides?" My heart is in a blaze with love to souls this
   morning and if there are no others who care for the salvation of their
   fellow men, I can truly say I agonize for conversions! Forgive me--in
   my excitement my thoughts should seem tame and feeble, for I have
   passed out of the realm of thoughts and am under the absolute dominion
   of my feelings. Come, Holy Spirit, come and aid my tongue which is all
   too feeble to express the language of my inmost heart!

   I. We would observe, first, that such a question as this APPEALS TO OUR
   NATURAL AFFECTIONS. Surely, unless we have lost manhood, we love our
   kindred and desire their good! We have not yet become like the
   ostriches in the wilderness which care not for their young. Our flesh
   has not congealed into marble, nor are our hearts become like
   millstones. We have a very tender concern for those united to us by
   ties of nature and esteem them as parts of ourselves. What parent is
   not glad to see his children in good health? We will watch with them
   all through the weary night when they are ill and can we not pray for
   them when they are sick with sin?

   It is a singular mercy when our children are born to us without
   deformity and in full possession of every sense. And it is a great
   blessing when a man can look round upon a numerous household and see
   them all full of cheerfulness and hope. Do we care for their bodily
   welfare and shall we neglect to pray that their souls may prosper? Can
   we see the deformity of sin without tears? Can we remark the blindness
   of our children towards Divine things? Can we observe how deaf they are
   to the admonitions of mercy? Can we discover clearly the depravity of
   their nature without deep grief and regret? We hasten to the best
   physicians when we see anything amiss and we spare no cost for their
   recovery.

   Shall we ever be at peace, or know what rest means concerning them
   until we see their eyes open and the light of Jesus streaming into
   their souls--until we know that their tongues are loosed to tell of
   God's mercy towards them--until there is formed in them a new heart and
   a right spirit? We are anxious to see in our children a due share of
   intelligence. We are very quick to notice any signs of it. And perhaps
   we are over anxious to remark upon their shrewdness and good sense--it
   is an overwhelming sorrow to a parent to discover weakness or
   imbecility of mind in his offspring.

   But what shall we say if we cannot perceive any knowledge of Christ in
   our children? Shall the folly of their hearts cause us no anxiety? Does
   it give us no concern if they put bitter for sweet and sweet for
   bitter, darkness for light and light for darkness? Do we seek to have
   them educated in the various arts and sciences and not desire that they
   should comprehend with all saints the love of Christ which passes all
   knowledge? One thing is necessary--all the rest may have a temporary
   necessity, but the one thing--acceptance in Christ and faith in Jesus
   is absolutely necessary! Can we be content when we see them neatly
   dressed, strongly framed and progressing in their learning, while their
   souls are not clothed with Christ's righteousness and they are ignorant
   of the power of Divine love?

   Can we rest content while their souls are not trained for God, not
   tutored for Heaven, not educated for eternity? Why, common sense
   teaches our natural affection that the first thought should be the
   training of the soul and the highest desire of our spirits should be
   that they may live before God, whatever may become of them in their
   education as to the things of time and sense. It is only natural that
   we should care for the prosperity of our friends and children. We are
   grieved if we hear that they meet with any accident. If losses and
   calamities befall them, I trust we know how to weep with them that
   weep. We would sooner bear pain ourselves than that they should suffer.
   We have often felt our own cross to be very light, if we have thereby
   lifted a cross from the shoulders of those dear to us.

   But can we think of their sinning against God and abiding under the
   anger of the Most High without any emotion? Above all, can we
   contemplate for an instant their death and their appearance before God
   unpardoned--their condemnation and their eternal doom--without a horror
   taking hold upon us? My friend, my sister, my wife, my child in Hell!
   How can I bear the dreadful thought? Mother, if your child were running
   in the streets and there were a fear that yonder wheel would go over it
   and crush it, your heart would be in your mouth! Can you see your child
   in danger of eternal destruction without your bosom heaving high with
   fond maternal anxiety?

   If I saw my friend upon the edge of a precipice I would rush to his
   rescue. And can I be silent when I see so many whom I love walking upon
   the verge of eternal ruin, utterly unconcerned about their souls?
   Natural affection, which makes us care for our children and friends
   that they may prosper, will, if it is rightly trained, make us far more
   earnest for their salvation from the wrath to come. If there are any
   who are professedly Christians who nevertheless have no sort of
   interest in the welfare of their children, I only utter what I believe
   to be the solemn truth when I say that their profession is a mistake,
   if not an hypocrisy--they had better give it up! If you care not for
   the souls of others, you do not know the value of your own!

   God's people are a tender-hearted people. Like their Savior, they
   cannot look upon Jerusalem without weeping over it--they cannot view
   with complacency the destruction of any, much less can they be careless
   concerning the condition of those who spring from their own loins--who
   are united to them by ties of blood! Like Doddridge, we dare say in the
   sight of God, that we love the souls of men--

   "My God, I feel the mournful scene.
   My heart yearns over dying men!
   And gladly my pity would reclaim,
   And snatch the firebrands from the flame."

   I set you down as nearer akin to a devil than to a saint if you can go
   your way and look into the face of your friend or child and know him to
   be on the downward road and yet never pray for him nor use any means
   for his conversion. May God grant that no doctrinal belief may ever dry
   up the milk of human kindness in our souls!

   Certainly the doctrines of Divine Grace, such as election and effectual
   redemption, will not do so. Error may petrify, but the Truth of God
   melts. May we feel that no dogma can be Scriptural which is not
   consistent with a sincere love to men. Truth must be consistent with
   its Author's Character. And He who has revealed saving Truth is the God
   of Love-- no, He is Love itself! And that cannot be true which
   naturally and legitimately would lead men to be unloving! May we be
   such parents, such brothers, such sisters, such children that it shall
   be the first anxiety of our spirits that our children, our parents, our
   husband, our wife, our friends, our brothers and sisters should be
   brought to partake with us of the things of God!

   I do think that the query which is suggested this morning, "Have you in
   Sodom any besides?" is one which forcibly appeals to the natural
   affections while it does no violence to the judgment. I shall hope,
   therefore, that in such a congregation as the present, where there are
   so many loving hearts, my question will drop like a spark upon dry
   tinder to set the soul on fire or melt into the soul as a snowflake
   into the sea, to increase the flood of holy earnestness. My own heart
   is stirred in its inmost depths by the enquiry and I cannot but hope
   that yours will be also. You who are friends, I now pray you show
   yourselves friendly. Parents, be parents, indeed. Brothers, act a true
   fraternal part. Sisters, let your tender love find a fitting channel.
   Husbands and wives, let your conjugal union awaken you to most tender
   emotions. Let every fond relationship stir us to care for others while
   the enquiry is made, "Have you here any besides?"

   II. In the second place, the question is one which AROUSES HOLY
   SOLICITUDE. Shall I stop a moment while you think over the roll of your
   friends and kinsfolk? "Have you here any besides?" Are they all saved?
   Are you quite sure that all of them are rejoicing in Christ Jesus and
   are washed in His blood? Mother, it was such a comfort to you when your
   first-born was added to the Church. And what a joy when your fair
   daughters subscribed with their hand to the name of Jesus! Are there
   not others who are strangers to the commonwealth of Israel?

   Brother, it has been a great delight to you to see your brother saved.
   Your heart has swollen high with holy joy to know that a sister has
   passed from death unto life. But there are others of the family--are
   they all converted? Are there not some still in the gall of bitterness
   and in the bonds of iniquity--concerning whom even in the judgment of
   charity you are compelled to say, "Lord, have mercy upon them, for they
   have no mercy upon themselves"? Have you no tears for the unsaved ones?
   No prayers for those who abide under the wrath of God? In your house
   you have seen your servants saved. And next to the salvation of one's
   children, there is no greater mercy than to see one's servants walking
   in the faith--but are all of your servants saved?

   Is there not one in the house with you who still has not given her
   heart to Christ? You are happy, my Brother, thrice happy, if while I
   suggest this question you can read down the whole list with sparkling
   eyes and say, "Yes, I can say, like Noah, they are all with me in the
   ark--my wife and my sons and my sons' wives with them, they are all
   secure--and though the deluge sweep over the whole world, in that
   Covenant Ark of salvation, with my whole household, I hope to float in
   safety."

   But it is not so, I am afraid, with the most of us. We have an Esau as
   well as a Jacob, an Ishmael as well as an Isaac. To provoke you to
   earnest solicitude this morning, let me remind you of times when we
   should be anxious about our friends and children. When first we
   ourselves look to Christ, we should care for others. Oh, what a joy it
   is to feel the burden rolling from our shoulders--to be able to say
   with holy delight--"Great God, I'm saved! The chief of sinners is at
   last at peace with You! Your enemy is reconciled, my sin is covered, my
   iniquity is cast into the depths of the sea." What should be the next
   thought? If this is so sweet to me, there are my sin-burdened
   relatives--O God, bring them to know this blessedness!

   If I leap at the sound of Jesus' name and find it blessed to know that
   sin is forgiven, O my God, let others whom I love be set free and be
   enabled to triumph in justification through the blood of Jesus Christ!
   We would not eat our morsel alone lest it grow stale through our
   selfishness. The woods drops with honey--we cannot eat it all--let us
   call others to taste its sweetness. I think, dear Friends, there can be
   no better season than the first blush of your newborn piety in which to
   cry unto the Most High with strong crying and tears, that He would be
   pleased to pluck others, as He has done yourselves, like firebrands
   from the flame. "In the morning sow your seed."

   Then there are times of Christian enjoyment. When we have been sitting
   round the table of our dying Lord, we have been made to feast at the
   banquet of wine with King Jesus--the banner over us has been love and
   His fruit has been sweet unto our taste. But while we were downstairs
   at the table, did we not think of those upstairs among the spectators?
   Will not our hearts wing their flight with anxious desires towards
   loved ones who cannot unite with us? Do we not hope that before long
   they will sit side by side with us? Let us remember those at home this
   morning--at home, did I say? Alas, some are worse than at home for they
   are now where we were once, spending the Sunday in sin--finding their
   pleasures anywhere but in the things of God!

   A warm fire and a happy family gathering may well make us think of
   those shivering in the cold outside--I charge you, Believer, forget not
   your poor unconverted children. Let your highest and most rapt moments
   of communion with Christ be just the times when your soul shall speak
   to God as Abraham talked to his Father and his Friend and pleaded for
   the sinners of Sodom. I think when we are downcast, when our soul is
   filled with bitter trouble, then also is an appropriate season to pray
   for others. God turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his
   friends, and he may turn our captivity when we do the same. Why, if I
   who have an interest in Christ, yet feel so desponding, what must be
   the wretchedness of those who have no Christ to go to?

   If we who live on the bread of Heaven, yet complain that our spirit
   oftentimes sinks within us, what must be the failings of heart--the
   horror of great darkness--which those must experience who feed upon the
   wind and would gladly fill their bellies with the husks which the swine
   eat? Let your own grief help you to arrive at some knowledge of the
   griefs of unconverted souls and go to the Throne of Grace on their
   account. It may also help to stimulate this holy solicitude to think of
   how we shall feel in regard to our children and friends when they come
   to lie sick. They will be sick as well as others. And when they are in
   jeopardy of their lives and the physician tells us that their existence
   trembles in the scale, how shall we feel, then?

   Can we gaze upon their pallid countenances without bitter reproaches
   for our past indifference? I am afraid I cannot say I have had a sick
   friend concerning whom I could feel that I had done all I ought to have
   done. I do not know whether you have--happy are you if you feel quite
   guiltless. When we have seen our friends on their beds of languishing,
   have we not thought, "Ah, would to God we had over again the occasions
   and opportunities of talking to them on Divine things, for now they are
   so racked with pain, so distracted with many thoughts that there is
   scarcely room to sow the good seed, because of the many thorns." O that
   the harvest may not be past and the summer ended before we begin our
   sowing!

   Fools lose the spring and then lament in the time of harvest. May
   Heaven save us from the fool's lament. And what will you think if your
   children should die unconverted--your wife, your husband, your friend?
   To lose our loved ones is one of the sore, though common troubles of
   life. But oh, it can be little trouble to send on those who are ripe
   for Glory! Go where Glory waits you--we would not detain you here! To
   think that while we are weeping here they are singing around the
   eternal Throne wipes the tears from our eyes! But what must it be to
   bury them without "a sure and certain hope of a glorious resurrection"?

   To put the body under the sod with this dread thought upon us, that,
   "we sorrow as those that have no hope"? It is the death of death to
   fear that our friends have not escaped the second death. Must you not
   confess, this morning, that if some of your kinsfolk were to die as
   they are, you could not, unless you were to stultify your own
   conscience, entertain anything like a sure hope of their entering into
   eternal life? Now, as you would wish you had prayed for them, as you
   would wish you had labored with them, when they are dead, so do now!
   While there is an opportunity, avail yourself of it for fear you should
   have to mourn with briny tears that the soul has gone, and that you
   have never rendered it any help. Before the sun goes down forever, use
   its light. It is vain to warn after the ship is wrecked. Hell will
   never give up its prey--nor will your tears mitigate the fury of its
   fires. It is now or never. Lord, make it now!

   Think again, how you would care for your friends if you were, yourself,
   this morning very near death. O my Hearers, I sometimes think of the
   time when I shall lie a-dying--when all alone my spirit must cross the
   black brook of Kedron and leave the city of our solemnities for the
   other side of Jordan. Then such thoughts as these will surely steal
   over me-- "O that I might preach to this people again! O that I had the
   opportunity of addressing those thousands once more that I might preach
   in real earnest and not talk away the time! O that I might deal with
   their souls, as if they really were immortal and there were a judgment
   to come! O that I might set before them life and death, Hell and Heaven
   and plead with them, knowing the terrors of the Lord."

   I can scarcely tell you what must be the sorrow of a dying man at the
   end of an unfaithful ministry. Then shall every wasted opportunity
   stuff his pillow with thorns. There shall be no sleep for that aching
   head, no rest for those weary eyes--he has damned the souls of men by
   his carelessness and sloth and now he must give his account. He is
   haunted by grim forebodings of wrath to come and knows not where to
   turn for comfort. He has insulted Heaven and played into the hands of
   Hell. What will be your thought, my Hearers, if in your narrower sphere
   you shall have been unfaithful?

   There on the sick bed, though the comforts of complete forgiveness may
   take away from you the sting of death, which is sin, yet even the blood
   of Christ will not be able to remove those solemn heart-moving regrets
   which shall be suggested by a lively remembrance that you had
   opportunities of doing good and wasted them! And now that you are
   dying, but leaving unconverted children behind you--dying and the wife
   is still unsaved--dying, and your father still lives to whom you might
   have spoken of the way of God, but who now has no loving child to care
   about his soul!

   As you must die, Believers, seek to live like dying men and labor for
   your sons and daughters and kinsfolk as those who must soon leave them
   and have no other opportunities of doing them good. You cannot come
   back from Heaven! If you have neglected a duty, you cannot leave Heaven
   to perform it. If there is one thing that can make an angel in Heaven
   envy a man on earth, it is his power to intercede for sinners, to
   preach, to woo and to win souls. If there is one thing which a
   glorified saint before the Throne of God might wish to come to earth
   for, it is surely this--that he might speak to impenitent brothers,
   that he might weep over unconverted friends and perhaps bring them to
   repentance. "Work while it is called today, for the night comes wherein
   no man can work."

   III. And now we turn, seeking the same earnest object, to the third
   point of our discourse. Such a question as this is calculated to EXCITE
   US TO ANXIOUS EFFORT for mere solicitude without effort is not genuine.
   A man must not pretend that he cares for the souls of others so long as
   he leaves one stone unturned which might be the means of blessing them.
   It seems to me, then, that if we are in a right state of heart this
   morning, one of the first things we shall do will be to tell those dear
   to us of their danger.

   I think 1 see Lot going out that night. No very safe place, the streets
   of Sodom, especially after that wretched scene which had been enacted
   at his own door--a miracle had rescued him. But yet with his life in
   his hand, the good old man goes to the door of his sons-in-law.
   Affection is not always so strong towards sons-in-law as towards those
   who are of our own blood. Still he goes with all solemnity of feeling,
   knowing that he, himself, should be rescued, but trembling lest these
   sons-in-law should refuse the invitation to escape with him.

   The good old man finds his way through the winding streets of Sodom and
   begins to knock at the door with a resolute hand. They look down from
   the top of the house. "That is the voice of old Lot," says one, "what
   is he doing, disturbing our comfortable slumber?" They have but little
   love for him. They have put on some pretense of affection that they
   might win his daughters, but Sodomites cannot have much love for
   righteous men. And consequently they have no care for Lot. "What does
   the old fellow want at this time of night?" they say. "Why cannot he
   keep seasonable hours? Besides, what a disturbance there was at his own
   door just now! Does he not know better than to knock at our door, when
   he so resolutely shut his own to protect two tramping strangers? What
   does he want?"

   He cries to them, "My sons, this city is to be burned with fire in the
   morning! Come, get up and flee with me, for the two men who came to me
   were angels sent from God to rescue me and they have bid me seek you.
   Come with me!" "Ah," they say. "What next? Old Lob--that is your name,
   Lob, instead of Lot--go your way and talk about your silly dreams to
   men of softer brains and not to us." "No," says he, "it is even so, by
   the love you bear my daughters, bear with me. If it is not so it will
   not matter, you can return. But if it is so, think what it will be to
   be destroyed with fire and brimstone out of Heaven! I pray you, come."

   But they scoff at him--they tell him he is only mocking them--that he
   has some motive for wishing to get them into the street and they bid
   him go. And with an aching heart the poor old man goes back, feeling
   something more than Isaiah's grief--"Who has believed our report? And
   to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?" Yet as he fled out of Sodom,
   if the sight of his daughters reminded him of their husbands, he would
   think, "I am clear of their blood. I did plead with them. I did exhort
   them to escape. And if they would not, why, they would not--and the sin
   lies at their own door."

   It will be some comfort to the Christian, if the worst should come to
   worst, that he has warned the ungodly. Let us tell them of their danger
   and never cease to warn until they cease to sin. Having so done, it is
   the duty of every Christian to tell his friend the remedy. Plain
   speaking about Christ is the ordinary means of bringing sinners to
   repentance. Those ministers most useful in soul-seeking are those who
   put the doctrine of simple faith in the Atonement in the clearest
   light. Let not your friend perish through ignorance. Tell him that
   whoever comes unto Christ He will in no wise cast out-- that there is
   life in a look at the Crucified Savior! Tell him that whoever believes
   that Jesus is the Christ is born of God. Preach no salvation by
   works--but preach faith and works only as the fruit of faith.

   And let the doctrine that Christ came to seek and to save that which
   was lost be clearly set before your friend's eyes. Remember, it is not
   enough coldly to warn them of danger and doctrinally to teach the
   remedy. There are many who will go so far. But I hold, my Brothers and
   Sisters, that we are bound to use a constraint with our friends. Do not
   misunderstand me--only a loving and a tender constraint, such as these
   angels used with Lot. Press them, plead with them, take them by the
   hand. Some are afraid to do this. They fear that they should be doing
   the Spirit's work. My dear Brother, that is the reason why I do it, for
   I know the Spirit of God works by means and I am in hopes that He will
   use me to do His own work.

   "Well, but we cannot bring them to Christ," says one. That is true and
   that is false. That is true--you cannot, unless God is with you. But
   instrumentality is the ordinary method by which God accomplishes His
   purpose and therefore you may be enabled to bring sinners to Jesus. I
   do not, when I plead with sinners, plead as though I pleaded, or as
   though there were anything in my pleading which could do them good! I
   plead, as Paul says, "As though God did beseech you by us." This is the
   position the Christian parent should take up, the position of God
   pleading with men, "As though God did beseech you by us." Not man
   seeking to win a soul, but the Son of Man coming to seek and to save
   that which was lost.

   Do not be afraid, dear Friends, that you will ever violate the doctrine
   of election or predestination by the most solemn determination you can
   make in the sight of God that you will wrestle and weep and agonize to
   bring your children to Himself. Rightly understood, this doctrine is an
   incentive to duty and never an opiate for sloth. "Compel them to come
   in," is the Savior's own command. I remember an old man who was a
   nursing father to all the young men in the parish where he lived. This
   one thing he used to do--there was scarcely a lad whom he would not
   know and speak to and there was a time with most of the lads when he
   specially sought to see them decided.

   Suppose one of them was going away to London? He would be sure to ask
   him to have a cup of tea with him. "You are going away, John," he would
   say, "I should not like you to go without spending an evening with me."
   If it was a fine sunshiny evening, he would say, "You know I have often
   talked to you about the things of God and I am afraid that as yet there
   has been no impression produced. You are going to London and will meet
   with many temptations and I fear you may fall into them. I should like
   to pray with you once before you go. Let us walk down the field
   together."

   There was a tree, an old oak tree in a solitary place, where he would
   say, "To help you to remember my words better, we will pray under this
   tree." The young and the old knelt together and the old man poured out
   his soul before God. And when he had wrestled with God and talked with
   his young friend, he would say, "Now, when I am dead and gone and you
   will perhaps come back to the place where you lived when a youth--let
   that tree be a witness between God and your soul that here I wrestled
   with you. And if you forget God and do not give your heart to Christ,
   let that tree stand to accuse your conscience till it yields to the
   entreaties of Divine love."

   Now here was a using of what I have styled constraint. But it is not a
   constraint, you see, such as the Papist would use. And as for physical
   force, of course that is never to be used--but the constraint of
   spiritual force, Divine love and earnestness. May I ask whether we have
   all done our duty in this matter? Here stands one who has not. And if
   every Christian here who has something to repent of in this matter were
   to stand up, I question, Brothers and Sisters, whether many of us dare
   keep our seats.

   Ah, if they perish, we cannot say that we wept after them! Whitfield
   could say to his congregations often, "Ah, if you are lost, it is not
   for want of weeping after, not for want of my groans and tears." But I
   am afraid if our children were lost, or our brothers and sisters were
   lost, we could not say so much as that. May God forgive the past and
   may He help us in the future. And from this time forth may we resolve
   as in the presence of the flowing wounds of Christ and as He enables us
   we will--

   "Tell to sinners round,
   What a dear Savior we have found,
   Point them to the redeeming blood,
   And say, 'Behold the way to God.'"

   IV. And now I shall not weary you, I trust, if I continue a little
   longer. It seems to me that our text FOSTERS A VERY CHEERING HOPE. It
   says, "Have you here any besides?," as much as if it would say, "Hope
   for them all. Why should they not all be brought out of Sodom? Why
   should one be left behind?" That was a grand saying of Moses when
   Pharaoh said, "Go, serve the Lord. Only let your flocks and your herds
   be stayed: let your little ones also go with you. And Moses said, You
   must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice
   unto the Lord our God. Our cattle also shall go with us. There shall
   not an hoof be left behind"--the smallest lamb, or the meanest
   goat--they shall all come out.

   So it is glorious when in strength of faith the father of the family
   can feel that he will give the Master no rest till they are all saved.
   Not leaving William out, nor omitting Mary. Not saying, "Well, thank
   God, I am blessed above the aver- age--the most of my children are
   converted and if one shall perish, I must bear with it as a cross." No!
   But saying in your soul with humble boldness--

   "Lord, I will not let You go, Till a blessing You bestow upon every
   child of my loins, upon every brother and every sister and every
   relative." I say the text fosters a hope that you may yet see them all
   brought to Jesus!

   I stayed some few months ago with a Brother in Christ in a certain town
   in the midland counties. I might mention his name if I could, He is the
   banker of the town. I was delighted when staying there, to hear a story
   from his own lips which is also printed and worthy of your careful
   perusal. His wife, a godly woman, had been exercised with many thoughts
   for her husband and children. She did not live to see her prayers
   answered. She fell asleep, but with a good hope that yet her husband
   and her children would join her in the skies.

   She said that her husband would experience a bad trial, but that it
   would be greatly blessed to him and so it turned out. Our esteemed
   friend, that excellent man of God, Mr. Denham Smith, went to preach in
   the town and the gentleman went to hear him. He did not go with any
   desire for conversion--he knew not its value--he merely went to hear
   Mr. Smith as a person well known as an evangelist. The Word, through
   Divine Grace, pierced his heart and about the same time it also reached
   the heart of one of his daughters. He was under deep distress of mind
   but through the simple teaching of our friend, Mr. Smith, he was led to
   rest upon Jesus and cast his anchor in the blessed anchorage of the
   Atonement.

   His daughter, about the same time, through the united prayers of her
   newly-converted father and Mr. Smith, was brought into perfect peace.
   He thought, "This is a happy season--two of my sons are out on
   business, but I will send for them to come home." They were brought
   home--they were asked to go and hear Mr. Smith. One of them found the
   Savior. The other remained indifferent. The three converted ones began
   to pray for the others and, to make the story--a blessed story--very
   short, there were six in the household, sons and daughters, they were
   all saved, father included!

   They had but three domestic servants--Mr. Smith visited them a second
   time. It had been a subject of prayer that the three servants might be
   saved and they were so and are now a whole family walking in the Truth
   of God! Such an instance as this in a somewhat large family should
   excite the desire of all Christian parents, that they may have the same
   blessing! Of course we cannot expect it where there are very little
   children. But we can expect, we ought to expect family conversions. And
   in answer to prayer we may have it where the children are come to an
   age in which they are capable of understanding the things of God and
   knowing the Truth as it is in Christ Jesus. I know that many of you
   feel your eyes watering at the thought of being able to say, "Here am
   I, and the children You have given me, for I have no greater joy than
   this--to see my children walking in the Truth."

   Do not think that the conversion of children is a thing unusual or
   suspicious--look for it and believe in it. You cannot change their
   hearts, or give them Divine life --it is beyond your power. But it is
   not beyond the power of your God. And God will refuse His children
   nothing if they do but know how to plead His promise and ask in faith,
   doubting nothing. Only let us feel more about this and I am persuaded
   we shall see better times with regard to our young people. I am
   resolved, in connection with this Church, as soon as I can get over my
   many present engagements in the country, in Scotland and so on, that we
   will devote ourselves to looking more directly and personally after our
   young people.

   We must have special meetings with them. The pastor must commune with
   them. The elders and deacons must meet them. We must be seeking to
   bring in more souls. God has dealt very graciously with this Church and
   for eleven years there has been one long revival. But I want to see
   greater things than these. I believe that the prayers of the last three
   weeks are being heard. Last Friday I met with many of my Brethren, the
   ministers of London, in this place, to pray. We did pray. Our hearts
   were knit together in holy love and we prayed for our Churches and
   congregations and pleaded with God that He would make us better
   ministers and help us to be free from the blood of our hearers.

   And I expect in answer to the prayers of my Brethren that we shall get
   a blessing. Moreover we have all been pleading--may I not say all? We
   have been crying, "Will You not revive us again that Your people may
   rejoice in You?" But we must use the means. I must ask my dear Friends
   who love the Lord who are scattered about the Tabernacle to begin from
   this time forward to look after those who sit near them, to look after
   those who sit in the pews with them. Put questions to them and endeavor
   gently to lead them to the Savior. Instead of one address from this
   pulpit, make it a thousand addresses from Christians round about!

   Let me give you the nail and the hammer by preaching the sermon--but
   YOU--as agents in the hands of the Holy Spirit, labor to drive home the
   Word. And if I can get all of you who love the Lord into a thoroughly
   warm and earnest state, I am persuaded the great things we have seen
   are only the beginning of greater things to come! We are on the
   threshold of an era of mercy! We have journeyed to the edge of a long
   stretch of glorious sunlight, emerging out of the shadows into the
   serene clear shining of Jehovah's face. We shall see these galleries
   and these aisles and this vast area full of Believers yet! We shall see
   the Word of God running, having free course, and being glorified! But
   we must, dear Friends, be stirred up to holy action for it.

   V. Alas, I must conclude! Conclude, too, with a very dark and gloomy
   thought. The text SUGGESTS A VERY SOLEMN FEAR, namely, that there may
   be some in our households who will not be saved. Ah, young men and
   women! Ah, you who are fathers of Christian children, but not converted
   yourselves! You who are godless daughters and unre-generate sons of
   Christian people--you are lost now and you may be lost forever! Lot's
   sons-in-law were consumed and why not you? Saved shall the Patriarch
   be, but not saved the Patriarch's son, except he shall flee out of
   Sodom!

   Beware! No kinship can save you! You may be allied to a race of saints,
   but, being yourself a sinner, your pedigree cannot save you.
   Unconverted souls, flee away, I pray you! And may God's Grace direct
   you to the Rock of Ages split for you. Hide yourself in the cracks
   there and let your soul find peace through Jesus the Savior. May God
   bless these feeble words of mine to every soul here, for Jesus' sake.
   Amen.

                          The Smoke Of Their Torments

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY EVENING, NOVEMBER 20, 1864, BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT
   THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he had stood
   before the Lord. Then he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah and to ward
   all the land of the plain; and he saw, and behold, the smoke of the
   country went up as the smoke of a furnace. "

   Genesis 19:27,28.

   EARLY in the morning Abraham sought that favored spot where but
   yesterday God had been pleased to manifest Himself and where he had
   been favored with a season of extraordinary communion. Where should the
   Believer go, but to that choice place, dear to his heart, where he has
   communed with the Lord?--

   "Who that knows the worth of prayer, But wishes to be often there?"

   It is a high privilege, the highest which mortals can enjoy, to talk
   with God, to plead with Him, to use arguments and to prevail. Such
   Divine Grace had Abraham found. No marvel that he goes back to the
   place where God had thus drawn near to him. Doubtless one reason why he
   rose early and went to the place and looked towards Sodom was an
   anxious desire to know how his prayers had speeded.

   You remember he put a last "perhaps" to the Lord--"Perhaps ten shall be
   found there, And He said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake." He
   hopes, perhaps, that he need not go any further. He stops, for he feels
   sure in his heart that there must be ten righteous there! He turns his
   eyes to the quarter of the horizon where Sodom and Gomorrah should
   stand. So, when you have prayed, look out for answers. Elijah said to
   his servant, "Go and look towards the sea"--so say to your hopes--"Go
   and look towards the sea." If you have asked for rain, expect a cloud.
   If you have sought mercy, expect that God will stretch out His hand and
   bestow it upon you.

   But God does not always answer His children's prayers just as they
   would desire. Besides, His children are sometimes slack in asking and
   therefore they do not get what they desire. So Abraham, as he looked
   towards Sodom--instead of seeing the verdant well-watered plain and the
   roofs and spires of the city, saw nothing but black smoke and a lurid
   glare going up to Heaven like the smoke of a furnace.

   It is remarkable that he does not appear to have observed the storm as
   it came down from Heaven! From this fact we may infer how rapid the
   destruction of the cities must have been! God rained fire out of Heaven
   upon Sodom--it seems to have been done in a moment. The whole plain was
   destroyed. And all that Abraham saw after he rose up, which was
   probably just at sunrise, was merely the smoke that followed the
   conflagration.

   So does God drive His enemies away. As wax is melted before the fire,
   as the smoke is driven before the wind, so does the enemy perish before
   the breath of God when He comes forth out of His hiding place to punish
   sin. Can you now picture to yourselves the reverent Patriarch, as he
   leans upon his staff and looks with wondering gaze towards the smoking
   furnace? What must have been his thoughts? What a spectacle for him to
   gaze upon--from the very spot where he had held communion with God!

   Perhaps he could not have looked upon it from any other spot. He would
   have been too much afraid, too full of trembling. But there he felt
   safe. Standing where the Lord had talked with him he felt secure. And
   he could look even into that gruesome glare and that terrible blackness
   without dismay.

   And now I want to summon you, my dear Christian Friends, to the scene
   of your own most hallowed privileges--to the spot, as it were, on which
   Divine Grace has been shown most clearly to your souls and
   intercessions have been poured out most freely from your hearts. From
   there I would have you lift up your eyes. To what, do you ask, would I
   draw your attention? Ah, then I want you to look upon the smoke of the
   torments of lost spirits. I want believing eyes to gaze upon that
   place, "where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched."

   Only mind that you stand in the place where God has communed with you,
   beneath the Cross, where the blood shall drop upon you and you shall
   feel the sense of pardoned sin! From no other place can we view the
   wrath of God with proper and profitable emotions. But standing there
   our spirits shall be chastened, our souls comforted and with tears
   standing in our eyes--tears of gratitude and contrition--we shall
   venture to look upon that dark and terrible gulf where the wicked lie
   and shall derive some profit from the sight, even as Abraham doubtless
   did.

   First, then, tonight, let me suggest the emotions which should be
   awakened in the Christian's spirit when he takes a view of the wrath to
   come. Secondly, let me gather up some lessons which God teaches to His
   people and to the world from the doom of the wicked. And then, in
   closing, let me turn your eyes another way to a yet more awful display
   of Divine vengeance--even more awful, I say--than that which is to be
   perceived in Tophet, where lost souls are shut up.

   I. WITH WHAT EMOTIONS OUGHT WE TO GAZE UPON THE TORMENTS OF UNGODLY AND
   IMPENITENT SOULS? Certainly it should always be with an humble
   submission to the Divine will. The assurance that God is just, even in
   the midst of His hot displeasure, must ever be cherished. The Judge of
   all the earth cannot but do right. Though He is terrible and dreadful
   in His anger, as a consuming fire, yet is He still our God forever and
   ever, full of goodness and full of Truth.

   There is a deep-seated unbelief among Christians just now, about the
   eternity of future punishment. It is not outspo-ken--in many cases it
   is whispered--and it frequently assumes the shape of a spirit of
   benevolent desire that the doctrine may be disproved. I fear that at
   the bottom of all this there is a rebellion against the dread
   Sovereignty of God. There is a suspicion that sin is not, after all, so
   bad a thing as we have dreamed. There is an apology, or a lurking wish
   to apologize for sinners who are looked upon rather as objects of pity
   than as objects of indignation and really deserving the punishment
   which they have willfully brought upon themselves.

   I am afraid it is the old nature in us putting on the specious garb of
   charity which thus leads us to discredit a fact which is as certain as
   the happiness of Believers. Shake the foundations upon which the
   eternity of Hell rests and you have shaken Heaven's eternity, too.
   "These shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous
   into life eternal." There is precisely the same word in the original.
   We have it translated a little more strongly in our version, but the
   word stands the same. And if the one is not eternal, the other is not!

   Brethren, this is a fearful thing. Who can meditate upon the place
   appointed for the wicked without a shudder? Ungodly men seem to think
   we like to preach upon these topics. Far, far is it from being the
   case. I have had to censure myself of late for scarcely having preached
   at all upon them. They fancy that Christian men can look with
   complacency upon the torment of the lost, imagining themselves to be
   safe! They know not what they say. The very reverse of such a spirit is
   common among us.

   We shudder so much at the thought of men being cast away forever and
   horror takes so strong a hold upon us that if we could doubt it, we
   would. And if we could disprove it altogether, we feel we should be
   glad. But we dare not attempt the task because we know that it were to
   impugn the sentence of the Almighty and provoke a quarrel against the
   Most High. Great Judge of all! You shall trample upon Your enemies in
   the day of Your wrath! Yet shall You be as glorious in that act as when
   You pardon sin and pass by transgression. Christian, look there and, as
   you look, rebel not, but say, "True and righteous are You, O God. Let
   Your name be honored evermore!"

   Surely, too, another emotion, which a glance towards the dreary doom of
   the ungodly can never fail to prompt, is that of gratitude. "And why am
   I not there? They gnaw their fire-tormented tongues in vain--and why am
   I not there? Did they sin? I have sinned. Did they curse God and die?
   I, too, have cursed God. And it was a marvel that I did not die."--

   "Oh, were it not for Grace Divine, That late so dreadful had been
   mine."

   Some of you who were accustomed to frequent the ale house, whose voices
   were loud in the lascivious song, who polluted eventide with sin and
   spoiled the day with your ungodliness--thank God that you have been
   washed in the precious blood of Jesus--for as you read the list of the
   lascivious and so on, you are compelled to say, "Such were some of us.
   But we are washed, but we are sanctified, but we are justified in the
   name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God."

   Let the depths of Hell constrain you to heights of gratitude. And let
   the wailing and the gnashing of teeth which come up from there appeal
   to your lips, your heart, your very bowels and all that is within
   you--for the music of thank- fulness that you have escaped. Should
   there not also here be deep feelings of humility? Look to the hole of
   the pit where you were lifted and the rock where God has hewn you! What
   those sinners were, such were you!

   There was nothing in you that would carry you to Heaven, but everything
   that would have carried you down to Hell. You are a brand plucked from
   the burning--you would have burned in that fire as well as others! And
   can you lift up your head, man, and boast of yourself and say, "O God,
   I thank You that I am not as other men"? No, not if you are in your
   senses. But humbled and yet thankful, you will go your way with a
   subdued heart, looking upon others with pity and with love and
   anxiously desiring to pluck them, also, from the flames and guide their
   feet into the way of peace.

   And there is another sensation which must go through every nerve--and
   the thought will sometimes blanch our cheeks with terror--lest we also
   should go there. I think a glance of the eye towards the smoke of
   Gehenna would always prompt a holy jealousy over one's own heart and a
   diligent watchfulness of one's own walk. What do you say to this,
   professor? You see the smoke going up forever--what if you should go
   there after all? Remember, it is one thing to profess to be a Christian
   and quite another thing to be truly converted. You may go to the gates
   of Heaven by profession--but there is a back door to Hell.

   High professor, take care. If your wings are made of wax they will
   melt. And the higher they soar, the greater your fall will be. It will
   be a dreary day for any of us if we have to go from the pulpit to
   perdition, from the Lord's Table to communion with devils and from
   drinking the cup in which we commemorate the sacrifice of Christ to the
   drinking of the cup of trembling--in which the dregs of God's wrath are
   to be found. If I must perish, I would rather perish as an
   openly-avowed sinner than as a hypocrite--for the doom of a man who has
   made a fair show in the flesh and a fine pretense of godliness must be
   increased by the loss which he suffers--the hopes which are
   disappointed--the professions which have turned out to be lies.

   Members of this Church, I speak to you hoping that you will put the
   question among yourselves, "Is it I, Lord? Is it I?" My fellow laborers
   in this Church, deacons and elders, let us search ourselves! Let not
   your gray heads exempt you from the duty of self-examination. Let not
   your office screen you from the suspicion that, after all, you may be
   deceived. Come, let us go together as if we never went before to the
   Cross of Jesus! Let us look up to Him as He hangs bleeding there and if
   up to this moment we never have been saved, let us say, "Jesus, accept
   us now."--

   "A guilty, weak and helpless worm,
   On Your kind arm I fall--
   Be You my strength and righteousness,
   My Jesus and my All."

   These at least are some of the feelings with which we, like Abraham,
   standing in the place where God has communed with us, may look towards
   Sodom and see the smoke going up as the smoke of a furnace. We shall
   pause awhile and then notice the teaching which seems to come from the
   dreadful doctrine of the wrath to come.

   II. Look, Christian, if you can look and see there THE EVIL OF SIN. Are
   you startled? That is the true harvest of the sowing of iniquity. Come,
   Sinner, I charge you look at it. This is what sin brings forth--this is
   the full-grown child. You have dandled it on your knee. You have kissed
   and fondled it--see what it comes to. Hell is but sin full-grown, that
   is all. You played with that young lion--see how it ravishes and how it
   tears in pieces now that it has come to its strength. Did you not smile
   at the azure scales of the serpent? See its poison! See to what its
   stings have brought those who have never looked to the brazen serpent
   for healing!

   Next time the enemy says to you, "Is it not a little one?" answer him,
   "Behold how great a matter a little fire kindles." Remind him that the
   mustard is the smallest among seeds but yet it grows to a great tree.
   Is it so? Do you account for sin as a peccadillo, a flaw scarcely to be
   noticed, a mere joke, a piece of fun? But see the tree which springs
   from it! There is no joke there--no fun in Hell. Fools make a mockery
   of sin, which is but an egg. But when the egg is hatched and the bird
   full-fledged, they will find that they must laugh on the other side of
   their mouths, if they laugh at all.

   My God, from this day forward help me to see through the thin curtain
   which covers up sin and whenever Satan tells me that such-and-such a
   thing is for my pleasure, let me remember the pain of that penalty
   wrapped up in it! When he tells me that such a thing is for my profit,
   let me know that it can never profit me to gain the whole world and
   lose my own soul! Let me feel it is no sport to sin, for only a madman
   would scatter firebrands and death and say it is sport.

   You did not know that sin was so evil. Some of you will never know how
   evil it is till the sweetness of honey has passed from your mouth and
   the bitterness of death preys at your organs! You will count it
   harmless till you are hopelessly stricken with its sting. What? Is
   there no way to teach you the evil of sin but to cast you into Hell to
   learn the lesson? There you cannot profit but only perish by the
   knowledge acquired too late! O that you were wise, you thoughtless
   ones, and looking at the smoke of the ruin of others would learn how
   dreadful is that sin which will before long ruin you, as it has already
   ruined them!

   Do you think that God struck Sodom and that He will not strike you?
   Drunkard, swearer, shall Gomorrah perish and shall you escape? No! He
   is the same God today to punish sin as He was then. I say see the
   blackness of your sin by the light of Hell's fire and as the smoke goes
   up forever, ask yourself will you sin when such is the inevitable
   result? Will you dwell with sin if this involves dwelling with
   tormenting fire? This doctrine I would to God we could learn in our
   hearts! It is hard for me to preach it! It is harder, still, for you to
   learn it! But none ever know the love of Christ till they know
   something of the evil of sin.

   As the Christian, with downcast and blushing face looks to the place
   where their worm dies not and their fire is not quenched, he is
   awe-struck with the justice of God. What? Is God so just as this? He
   swears, "As I live, says the Lord, I ha ve no pleasure in the death of
   him that dies, but had rather that he should turn unto Me and live." He
   is a God so good that He delights in mercy and never is His soul more
   glad than when He passes by transgression, iniquity and sin and
   receives His Eph-raims to His bosom.

   Butis this God so severely just? Shall men, made in His own image, be
   broken by Him as with a rod of iron? WillHe consign them to that
   Tophet, the pile where there is fire and much wood?Shall the ire of the
   Almighty be the flame that kindles it? Can He be a God of love and yet
   treat sinners thus? Then how awfullyjust must God be! How stern this
   attribute of unimpeachable justice! Some talk of God as though mercy
   were the sole quality of the Divine Character and He had no other
   attribute. But the God of Scripture is to be adored in every attribute
   by which He is revealed.

   "God is Love." But know, too, that His justice shall beam forth with
   ineffable splendor when He whets His glittering sword and says, "Ah, I
   will ease Me of My adversaries and avenge Me of My enemies." My God,
   when He came on Sinai, touched the mountains and they smoked! Coals of
   fire went before Him. He did ride upon the wings of the wind! Thick
   darkness was round about Him. His voice was thunder and He spoke in
   lightning. Even Moses did exceedingly fear and quake. What will He be
   when He comes to punish for offenses if He is thus dreadful when He
   comes merely to give the Law?

   May you never know the weight of the eternal arm when it shall come
   down upon a guilty conscience. May we never feel in body and in soul
   how strict, how severe, how unflinching is that mighty God who has
   unsheathed His sword forever and bathed it in Heaven and made this as
   His solemn oath that He will by no means spare the guilty, but will cut
   them off root and branch and destroy them forever! Admire the justice
   of God. Muse upon it much. Think with what solemn pomp it shall be
   vindicated.

   Oh, what a holocaust of victims shall burn forever in attestation of
   His majesty! Let your soul be humbled! Boast no more! Bow at His feet!
   Submit yourself to Him! "Kiss the Son, lest He be angry, and you perish
   from the way, when His wrath is kindled but a little."

   Another lesson now comes to us and one which I hope will be more
   pleasing and affect some minds that may not be moved by what we have,
   up to now, said. Looking at the destruction of the wicked, this
   reflection crosses our minds. We, His people, have been redeemed from
   destruction! What a price must that have been which redeemed us from
   such woe and rescued us from such a place of torment! You have learned
   from this pulpit the doctrine of Substitution, how the Lord Jesus
   Christ took the sins of His people and stood to suffer in their place.
   We do not say that Christ endured the Hell of His people--the precise
   torment which His people ought to have suffered--but we do say upon
   Scriptural warrant that Christ endured a pain and agony which was
   tantamount and accepted by God as the proper substitution for all the
   griefs which were due to the sins of His people.

   Who can form an idea of what the torment of one soul must be that is
   cast away forever? Not, remember, the torment of an hour, a day, a
   month, a year, a century, a thousand years, but forever--FOREVER! You
   cannot measure that. But you will have to multiply that by ten thousand
   times ten thousand when you remember that Jesus laid down His life for
   many and gave Himself a ransom for His sheep. Nor are these a few, but
   a great multitude which no man can number. Well did the Psalmist say,
   as he typified the Messiah, "All Your waves and Your billows are gone
   over Me." One soul that is lost cannot feel all the waves and billows,
   but Jehovah Jesus did!

   None but a God could bear what He endured. Beneath that ocean of
   tremendous fire the mighty Substitute bowed His majestic head--that
   very head which Heaven worshipped and which is crowned with everlasting
   splendor--bowed himself in the great Baptism of almighty wrath that the
   waves of swelling grief might roll over it. Yes, every wave and every
   drop of every wave of Divine wrath that was due to His people! Think,
   think, Christian, as you hear that solemn trampling, as you hear the
   wailing of the lost, as your eyes seek to penetrate that land of death,
   as your whole soul is alarmed with gloomy forebodings of that
   wrath--think what must have been in the tremendous cup--the Hells of
   all His people, not actually, but virtually condensed into the pangs of
   an hour!

   He did but drink it and all His veins were flushed with hot blood.
   Every nerve became a high road for the hot chariots of pain to drive
   along. He cried, "If it is possible, let this cup pass from Me." It was
   not possible! He set it to His lips. He drank, He drank right on. His
   back was scourged, but still He drank. His head was pierced with the
   crown of thorns, but He took not away His lips.

   The spittle flowed down His cheeks. They were black with the bruising
   of mailed fists. Reproach had broken His heart and shame had covered
   His face--but on, still on He drank. They pierced His hands and His
   feet. They offered Him vinegar. They tore away His clothes. They
   stripped Him naked! They left Him without a comforter. Devils
   surrounded Him with mockery and men with scorn. But on, still on, He
   drank! O blessed Savior! Till at last He had swallowed every bitter
   drop--and turning the chalice upside down, not so much as one black
   drop trembled on its brim, for--

   "At one tremendous draught of love, He drained destruction dry."

   For every one of His people He exhausted the cup and there was not a
   pang, nor a grief, nor a penal groan left for any one of His elect. He
   suffered, the Just for the unjust, that He might bring them to God!

   Here is a plummet to fathom the depths of the Savior's griefs. But who
   can throw the lead and who can tell when it strikes the bottom! God
   only knows the griefs of His dear Son. Even lost spirits can scarcely
   guess it. And oh, as you look into that smoke, ascending forever and
   ever, say, "Hallelujah, Jesus! For You have redeemed us unto God by
   Your blood and we shall reign with You forever and ever."

   That fearful vision which beclouds my eyes and makes them feel heavy at
   the same time presses upon me with a tremendous weight while I mention
   another Truth of God. Behold here the solemnity of the Gospel ministry,
   the responsibility of those who listen to it and the need there is for
   earnestness in handling Divine things! Have I to deal with immortal
   souls? Then let me not trifle. Have I to talk with men who must spend
   eternity in Heaven or in Hell? Then wake up, sluggish flesh and bear
   not down my spirit! And you, my Soul, be stirred up to the highest
   degree of intensity of love, and of earnest devotedness that men may
   be, by some means, or by any means, brought to escape from the wrath to
   come!

   I would to God I could preach as Baxter did! That man, the victim of
   many diseases, but sane and healthy in his mind, said he never came to
   his pulpit without tears and his knees knocking together, for he had to
   speak for God with men who must soon appear before His bar and he,
   himself, must appear there, too, to give an account of his preaching to
   them. O Sirs, it is perhaps but a matter of amusement for some of you
   to come on a Sunday evening into this place, or any other. But believe
   us, it is no matter of amusement for us who have to preach to you!

   We would not have accepted our office if it had not been thrust upon
   us! Woe is unto us if we preach not the Gospel! But if we do preach the
   Gospel, still terrors seize hold upon us, for our heart is ready to
   break when we think how the multitude reject that Gospel and go their
   way to their farms and their merchandise and will not come to the
   Gospel-supper to be fed. Preaching will seem dreadful work to the
   preacher when he comes to die if he has not been faithful. And it will
   not seem slight work to you when you come to die, if you have heard in
   vain! What would you give for another Sunday, for another invitation to
   hear those faithful sermons once more--to be moved by Divine love once
   more?

   What would you give when inexorable death shall tell you that your
   hour-glass is empty, that your candle is burnt out and that your soul
   must speed its way to stand before God? My Brothers in the faith, with
   what earnestness should this alarm you! You are dealing, remember
   again, with souls that must sink to Hell unless they find mercy in
   Christ Jesus. It is said that when Michelangelo painted his celebrated
   picture of the resurrection, he went by permission to the graveyard and
   took out the newly-buried dead and piled up the corpses by his bedside.
   He then slept in the midst of them that he might get his mind into
   something like a proper frame for picturing the horrors of that
   tremendous day.

   I would not have you do such a thing as that. But living as you do in
   the midst of lost souls, I pray and beseech you to realize the prospect
   of their speedy perdition as a vivid fact. As you go to your bed,
   remember the despair and the dismay of those who dared to live in sin
   and have already died without hope. I think you will, then, be in a
   proper frame to paint that life-picture which I hope each and all of us
   have set our hearts upon--of the conversion of the souls of many by our
   means. Oh, we are not alive, we are half dead!

   Whitfield could say, "When I think of these things, I wish I could
   stand upon the top of every hackney coach in London and preach to the
   passersby." We do not preach as if we meant it! I am afraid that we
   make Infidels by our lethargy and that you Christian people help to
   prevent the usefulness of the Word of God by the apparent indifference
   with which you treat eternal things. If Hell is a fiction, say so, and
   honestly play the Infidel. But if it is real and you believe it, wake
   up, you that so believe, and leave no stone unturned, no means untried
   by which through the power of the Holy Spirit sinners may be saved!

   Pledge yourselves this night, as with your hands upon the horns of the
   altar! Pledge yourselves as you sit in the place where God has often
   met with you that from this hour you will seek, God helping you, to
   love your neighbor as yourself and prove your love by pitying
   earnestness in seeking his salvation. That Truth seems to be written
   clearly enough in letters of fire in the midst of the smoke that comes
   up from the desolation of lost souls. And yet it is not merely
   preaching, important as that is. It is not merely warning our friends
   and our neighbors, though we should never lose an opportunity of
   telling them of their danger with more feeling than mere fidelity can
   inspire--yes, with that repeated earnestness which deep convictions
   from the very Word of the Lord and strong affection for the souls of
   men alone can prompt.

   Let me entreat you--consider the use that Abraham made of that
   extraordinary Revelation, "Shall I hide from Abraham," said the Lord,
   "the things which I do?" "And shall I cease to use the precious
   opportunity of pleading for my neighbors?" appears to have been the old
   Patriarch's spontaneous thought. My poor brother! Ah, poor Lot! His
   wife! His daughters! The city with its inhabitants! A thousand thoughts
   of melting pity come rushing up at once. He does not stand mute with
   astonishment. He immediately opens his heart with intercessions and
   fills his mouth with arguments!

   Oh Brothers and Sisters! That is just such a response to the secret of
   the Lord which He shows to His servants, as you should have always
   ready at hand. You need not wait for an opportunity! You have it now!
   Pray, pray, pray--pray without ceasing! Let the breath of prayer be
   fervent with heat. Let the prayer be so eager that it repeats itself,
   as Abraham's did, each time waxing hotter, drawing nearer, growing more
   bold--till you verily tremble at the venture! "Who can tell?" This we
   know, we are in no danger of offending God by crying for mercy, even
   when we see the two-edged sword flaming from His mouth! You have no
   cause to lay limits upon your importunity or to check the rising
   passion of your vehement desire. Prayer is a fire that needs stirring.
   And intercession is a holy wrestling in which practice alone can make
   you adept.

   Christians! Some of you may look at a doomed Sodom with other eyes than
   Abraham did. Lot is called a righteous man. And he was vexed with the
   filthy conversation of the wicked. He frowned at the men of Sodom and
   expostulated with them and wished that sinners would restrain their
   follies and not go to quite such lengths in sin. That is the sort of
   man Lot was. Have I not many a Lot before me now? The father of the
   faithful went a great deal beyond this. He lived far away from the
   scenes of vice and the haunts of impiety. I suppose he did not think it
   necessary to sleep a night in that cage of uncleanness, that he might
   familiarize himself with the profane customs of the people.

   He stood on hallowed ground, and prayed with a tender heart. He
   interceded with God! He multiplied his intercessions. Every time he
   prayed and with each fresh note of prayer his spirit grew more ardent.
   Impressed with God's severity, he takes courage from His goodness. Here
   is a fitting example for us! It is an example which I know will not be
   lost on some of you. The courage that can rebuke man must come from the
   strength that takes hold upon God. When your face shines like an angel
   with the radiance that the Mercy Seat reflects upon it, then it shall
   come to pass that the scorner will not be able to resist the wisdom or
   the spirit by which you speak!

   Oh how dreadful the jeopardy of the souls of unconverted men and women!
   Jonathan Edwards was once called upon to preach a sermon quite
   unexpectedly. I believe he had the habit of holding his manuscript
   close to his eyes, a most ungainly and apparently most inappropriate
   mode of uttering a discourse. He read it word for word. But as he read
   it, terror took hold upon his congregation! Weeping and sobbing were
   heard on every side, for the Holy Spirit was with him and each word
   came with power upon their souls.

   I cannot speak such language as he used. But if I could, I might be the
   means of making some feel in what a state of jeopardy they now are. You
   stand over the mouth of Hell upon a single plank and that plank is
   rotten! You hang over the jaws of perdition by a solitary rope and the
   strands of that rope are snapping, one by one. Frailer than the
   spider's web is your life and yet that is the only thing which divides
   you from a world of despair! The slightest insect commissioned by

   God's Providence may end your unhappy life. You know not where, or
   when, or how disease may overtake you. Death often floats in the
   atmosphere of the House of God. He may be looking through those stony
   eye sockets now!

   The skeleton monarch may be looking at and marking you as his prey.
   Could Xerxes stand here tonight, could he have a little Christianity
   mingled with his philosophy, then doubtless the tears he wept as he saw
   his army and remembered that in fifty years all would be dead, were
   nothing to those he would weep as he remembered that thousands this day
   found within the walls of Churches and Chapels and tens of thousands
   who are not found in any sanctuary, within less time than that will not
   only be dead but damned!

   Here is, indeed, subject for mourning, lamentation and woe. You stand
   upon the brink of that precipice and yet you play! You have heard the
   story of the monarch tyrant who invited one to a feast. When he came,
   the table was loaded with dainties and there was his chair on which he
   must sit, but just above him hung a sword suspended by a single hair.
   "Why do you not eat, Man? Is not the wine rich and rare? Fill your bowl
   and quaff it merrily." But he looks up. "Why do you not help yourself
   to all those dainty cakes which make the table groan. Why, Man, what
   ails you?" He looks up. And right wise is he in looking up, for on that
   hair his life depends.

   Would that you were as wise as he, for you will go your way and eat the
   fat and drink the sweet, but you forget that hair, that sword. The
   sword of Damocles could only kill the body, but this sword will kill
   both soul and body and kill them both forever--and but a hair keeps it
   from you now.

   III. I am weary with my picture. I am weary with looking into that
   thick darkness. Let me turn your eyes another way. Would you be saved?
   See yonder little hill outside Jerusalem's streets? God has become Man.
   He is bearing sin upon His shoulders. Here He comes all faint and weary
   with a ponderous beam upon His back. He struggles on. They remove the
   load a moment. But they force Him on with spears and goads and He, all
   willingly, leads the van. They come outside the city and while the
   sobbing daughters of Jerusalem stand looking on, they fling Him back
   upon the transverse piece of wood.

   I see the rough executioners, each man taking hold of a hand or of a
   foot, holding the nail in his mouth a moment till he gets that blessed
   palm all ready and then with his hammer driving in the nails through
   the hands and feet of the Son of God! He is fastened to the wood. They
   roughly lift up the Cross. A place has been dug for it. They dash it
   down. That jar has dislocated all His bones. What pain He endures in
   that moment when He is lifted up between earth and Heaven! And now He
   has a long season of suffering before Him. They sit down. They mock
   Him. They point to His wounds, scoff at His prayers, gloat their eyes
   upon His miseries.

   It is the Son of God suffering there. He shrieks "I thirst!" and they
   give Him vinegar to drink. He cries, "My God, My God, why have You
   forsaken Me?" Heaven is black above His head. Fever comes on--His
   tongue cleaves to the roof of His mouth--that mouth becomes hot as an
   oven. Blood comes streaming down from all His pores. Why do I picture
   this? Why, here is your salvation! You must have an interest in the
   sufferings of that Man, or you must suffer for yourself forever. Would
   you not desire to have Him as your Substitute? Then remember, whoever
   believes in Him is not condemned!

   Can you believe in Him now? To believe on Him is to trust Him. Will you
   trust yourself with Jesus? Now, if you do trust, your sins are
   forgiven! Your soul is accepted! Your eternal state is blessed and you
   are delivered from the wrath to come! Go your way at peace with God and
   at rest in your conscience and rejoice forevermore! May the Master
   bless even my feebleness tonight to your profit and may we meet in
   Heaven to His praise. Amen.

                 Delivered On Sunday Morning, December 4, 1864,

   BY C, H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "For He says, I have heard You in a time accepted and in the day of
   salvation have I succored You: behold, nowis the accepted time; behold,
   nowis the day of salvation." 2 Corinthians 6:2.

   WE frequently hear the question discussed as to which are the best
   times. Some are perpetually singing the praises of the "good old
   times," though, if one reads the pages of history it does not appear
   that the old times deserve any very special praise--unless oppression,
   ignorance, persecution and abundant suffering deserve to be the theme
   of song! It is the common habit of the fathers, with tears in their
   eyes, to say, "The former days were better than these." But we have the
   wisdom of Solomon on our side when we tell them they do not enquire
   wisely concerning this. "Do not say, Why were the former days better
   than these? For you do not enquire wisely concerning this" (Eccl.
   7:10).

   There are others who are always boasting of the present eventful
   period. There was none like it--this is the era of invention and of
   progress, the age of liberty and of light--when slavery must cast away
   her fetters and superstition must hide herself among her congenial
   associates--the moles and bats. But I cannot perceive that this century
   is so much the age of gold as to need very enthusiastic praises. Its
   greatest virtues are counterbalanced by greater sins. And the progress
   which has been made towards liberty has scarcely kept pace with its
   advance towards licentiousness--the barriers have been broken down, it
   is true--but in some places the bulwarks have fallen, too.

   Many there are with bright eyes looking forward to the future and their
   declaration is that the "good time is coming," if we but "wait a little
   longer"--if we will but look ahead, till this beast shall have been
   slain, that vial shall have been poured out and the other seal shall
   have been broken--then it is that we shall arrive at halcyon times! We
   agree with these watchful waiters--the age of gold is yet to come. The
   Advent is the world's best and brightest hope, insomuch that every
   lover of his kind may importunately cry out, "Come quickly! Yes, come
   quickly, Lord Jesus!"

   But there is one thought which should not leave us when talking about
   times and seasons, namely, that now, now, just now, this present flying
   moment--that second which is being recorded by the ticking of yonder
   clock--is the only time which we have to work with! I can do nothing
   with the days that are past. I can do nothing with the days future--
   though I reach out towards them--I cannot improve them. The past and
   present are fields far beyond the reach of my culture. I can neither
   plow nor sow the future, nor can I prune and correct the past. For
   practical purposes, the only time I have is that which is just now
   passing.

   Did I say I had it? While I said I had it, it is gone like the meteor
   which dashes adown the sky, or the eagle which flies afar, or the swift
   ships which disappear beyond the horizon! Time present is the only time
   I may ever have. Before any future shall have become present, I may be
   merged in eternity. As far as I know, this day may be the end of my
   life's career and when yonder sun sinks to his rest, I may sink to my
   rest also, so far as time is concerned. If there is more time allotted
   to me, yet it will never come to me in any other guise and form than as
   time present. I call it future now, but when I get, say, to 1866, or
   1880, it will be just like these moments--it will be to me present
   then--and consequently, for practical purposes, however much we may
   speculate upon the past or the future, the present moment is the only
   time we have, may have, or ever can have!

   And it becomes important that all our thoughts should be centered upon
   it if we would make our calling and election sure. Our text directs us
   to that solemn employment and it does so by a very telling argument.
   You perceive that our text is a quotation. How ought we to value the
   Old Testament! If inspired men of God, who spoke by the Holy Spirit
   quoted the Old Testament, how valuable must its bejeweled sentences be!
   The Apostle here quotes from the forty-ninth chapter of Isaiah, the
   eighth verse. In that passage the Lord God is speaking to the Messiah,
   speaking to our Lord Jesus Christ and He says to Him, "In an acceptable
   time have I heard You and in a day of salvation have I helped You."

   The first part, then, of this verse is a quotation from Isaiah. The
   second part of the verse is Paul's commentary upon the
   passage--"Behold, now is the accepted time." He takes his text from the
   Old Testament, but he gives us a New Testament sermon upon it. Let us
   try, if we can, to catch the Apostle's meaning. When Paul was reading
   in Isaiah, he perceived that the Lord Jehovah had expressly said to
   him, "Whom man despises, to Him whom the nation abhors (and who is this
   but the Lord Jesus?) in an acceptable time have I heard You."

   Jesus' sighs and tears and bloody sweat in the garden of Gethsemane did
   not fall unheeded. Like the blood of Abel, they cried from the ground
   and were heard acceptably above. An answer was given--this was plainly
   proved by the descent of the angel to strengthen the Savior. So the
   prophetic words add, "In a time accepted and in the day of salvation
   have I succored You." The Apostle infers from this that inasmuch as God
   has accepted Christ, the representative of His people, He has thereby
   ushered in an era of acceptance. Acceptance given to the Savior is, in
   the Apostle's view, acceptance given to sinners.

   Inasmuch as Christ is heard--He prayed not for Himself, but for
   us--there is, therefore, an accepted time for us begun and commenced
   from the day when Christ went up to the tree, stretched His hands to
   the nails, bowed His head to death and said, "It is finished."
   Paraphrase the text thus--"I have heard Jesus, the Surety, in an
   acceptable time. In the day of salvation have I succored Him, the
   mighty Savior. And therefore to you, My people, to you, poor lost and
   wandering sinners, to you, now is the accepted time. Now is the day of
   salvation."

   If Christ had not died, there had never been a day of salvation. If
   Christ had not been heard and accepted, an accepted time could never
   have come to us! But since He, man's representative, has obtained favor
   in the eyes of God and through His complete work has forever settled
   that favor upon Himself, there is favor in the heart of God to those
   whom Christ represented--even to those transgressors for whom He makes
   intercession!

   We shall now take the text, as God may help us, using it, first, to
   look at the now of Believers. Then, at the now of sinners. And after
   this taking wing from the text, we shall offer a few reflections upon
   now in Heaven. And close with a few solemn thoughts upon now in Hell.

   I. First, then, NOW, WITH THE BELIEVER. With him, "Now is the accepted
   time; behold, now is the day of salvation." As a Believer, it is well
   for the Christian to live in the present. I say, as a Believer, for,
   alas, there is a temptation to make our faith a thing of the past. It
   is nearly sixteen years since I first looked to the Crucified Redeemer
   and was lightened and my face was not ashamed. Is there a temptation in
   me to say the faith which I exercised in Christ in my youthful days has
   saved me, and therefore I am now in a different position from what I
   was then and need not feel now as I did at first?

   If there is such a temptation, let me shake it off as a man would shake
   off the deadly sleep of frozen climates. Let me, this morning, feel
   myself to be still just what I was--a loathsome sinner, undeserving,
   ill-deserving, Hell-deserving. And what then? Why, let me, then, this
   morning stand where I stood in the first moment of my salvation--at the
   foot of the Savior's Cross and look up and view the flowing of His
   soul-redeeming blood, with Divine assurance, knowing He has made my
   peace with God. At this moment, my dear Brothers and Sisters, your
   proper standing is as a sinner saved by blood, looking up to those dear
   wounds from which your pardon streamed.

   Have you had many virtues since then? Has the Grace of God led you on
   to add to your faith, courage? And to your courage, experience? And to
   your experience, brotherly kindness? And to brotherly kindness,
   charity? Yet, for all this, your safest, happiest, holiest, best
   position is at the foot of the Cross--with none of these things in your
   hand as the price of your salvation, but looking to your Redeemer--who
   alone has found a ransom for you. Since the day of your espousals you
   have committed many sins--dare you look at them without trembling? How
   often have we grieved our Lord? Our love to Him? Shall we dare call it
   love? Our faith in Him, how mixed with unbelief! Our zeal, how dashed
   with selfishness! Our humility, how stained with pride! Our patience,
   how spoiled with murmuring!

   Our every good thing is marred and rendered worthless! What a crop of
   weeds the soil of our heart has produced! When we look within we see,
   "The spirit that dwells in us lusts to envy," and every unclean bird
   seeks a lodging place in our hearts as in a grove of vanities--what
   shall we do? Why, come just now with all these sins and wash once more
   in that fountain which has lost none of its fullness! And feel the
   power of that precious blood which has not diminished one whit in its
   efficacy! I know the temptation is to climb to some higher room, but
   let us be warned by the nonsuccess of the boasting Pharisee and taught
   by the justification of the humble publican, still to cry, "God be
   merciful to me a sinner."

   Beware of trying to live before God as a minister. Brother minister,
   this is poor living--to live officially, to go to the closet or come
   into God's House merely as holding a certain profession! Oh, this is
   starving work! If your tendency is to live as Church members, if not
   altogether as worldly men, rouse yourselves from it, I pray you, and
   confess with Paul, "And the life which I now live in the flesh I live
   by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me."

   The proper place of a Christian is never to get one inch beyond this--a
   monument of Grace--a sinner saved by blood. I live in Jesus, on Jesus,
   for Jesus, with Jesus and hope soon to be perfectly conformed to His
   likeness. Let me remember that if there could be a moment in which my
   soul might stand out of Christ--no longer leaning upon Him and no
   longer covered with His righteousness--that very moment I must be
   condemned! For there is no condemnation only to them that are in Christ
   Jesus. But there is a terrible condemnation against every soul that is
   out of Him.

   Have you climbed so high that you have towered above the place of the
   poor thief? Come back again, Brother, for you have climbed to a
   dangerous altitude and maybe you shall find it a gallows where Haman
   was hanged and you shall hang with him. Or have you dived so deep in a
   sense of your own depravity, that you have forgotten to rest on Jesus
   Christ as able, still, to save you? My Brother, look up from the hole
   of the pit, for in it there is no water and you will perish there with
   a grievous famine.

   O, then, away with all but Jesus! None but Jesus--this must be our
   watchword at the gates of death and we must enter Heaven with it! As we
   have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so must we walk in Him--He must be
   Alpha and Omega, Beginning and End, Author and Finisher, First and
   Last. As Believers, let us by God the Holy Spirit's Grace keep our
   trust just where it was at first--in Him whom God has set forth to be a
   Propitiation for our sins!

   Take the word "now," again, and look at the Christian as a professor.
   Now you are in the House of God, my dear Friends and you remember that
   you profess to be followers of Christ. Now, therefore, you sing in holy
   hymns of praise and join in solemn prayers to God as Christians should
   do in the worship of God. Tomorrow morning, some of you, perhaps, will
   be at Copenhagen Fields' Market, some of you at Newgate Market, others
   of you will be lighting the fire in your master's house, others seeing
   to your numerous families, others taking down the shop shutters--will
   you then remember, dear Friends, that now, where you are then --you are
   a Christian?

   You are not to say, "I was a Christian yesterday," but "now, now I am
   not a Christian." A customer will come in. The temptation will be,
   perhaps, to take more than you ought to do. Will you please remember,
   "Now I am a child of God"? not, "yesterday, when I was listening to Mr.
   Spurgeon at the Tabernacle," but now! When you are in the market, there
   will be much to plague and vex you and perhaps you will think, "I
   cannot enjoy the Presence of God here." Oh, but my dear Brothers and
   Sisters, "now is the accepted time." Buying sheep, selling bullocks,
   using the hammer, snipping with the scissors, working at the plow,
   tending your sheep--now, now, NOW is the day of salvation--you are
   still a Christian--therefore act as a Christian!

   But you are much plagued and vexed. Somebody teases you, things go
   wrong--what could be a better stop to that little rising passion, what
   could keep the naughty spirit under control better than to
   remember--"Now, now I am a Christian--even now." A true Christian
   cannot shake off his character. He is really what he is--he always must
   be a Christian. I heard the other day of a certain Scotch moderate
   minister, who being much provoked by a person in his parish, said, "If
   I were not a minister, I would give you a sound thrashing, Sir." And
   when he was further irritated, he took off his coat and said, "There is
   the minister--there he lies." He was then in his shirt sleeves--"There
   is the minister and I am only So-and-So and will give you your due."
   And he proceeded at once to give the man a sound thrashing.

   It is just possible the man may have deserved it. That is not my point.
   But if a man can say, "There lies the minister," or, when you take off
   your coat tonight, if you can say, "There lies the member of the
   Church." If you, good women, when you take off your gowns, can say, as
   you hang up your best attire in the wardrobe, "There goes the
   Christian," then you have no religion at all, you have none whatever
   worth having! You have the faith of devils that will damn you, but not
   the faith of Christians that will save you!

   It is not a religious coat, but a renewed heart--I pray you keep this
   at all times on your mind--"Now I am accepted. Now I am saved--how can
   such a man as I do such a thing? How, then, can I do this great
   wickedness and sin against God?" Mordecai once wore the king's robe,
   but he soon took it off because he was not really a king. And thus do
   many act who wear the garb of religion in the House of God, but cast it
   off when they go home. When Lord Burleigh, Queen Elizabeth's counselor,
   reached his home he was so little pleased with the cares of State, that
   taking off his robe, he threw it down, saying, "Lay there, Lord
   Chancellor." Ah, how irksome must some men's religion be to them and
   how cheerfully would they lay aside its restraints! But you who are
   really the Lord's, will, I trust, feel your faith to be your constant
   help and your profession your perpetual honor. You will not, you cannot
   sin, because you are born of God.

   Suppose a Brother has his pen in his hand and is going to write what we
   sometimes call a nasty letter--now suppose an angel should whisper in
   his ear as he is writing, "Now, now, you are one of God's chosen. You
   have been washed in the precious blood of Christ and now you profess to
   be a member of His body, a king and a priest unto God." Why, I think he
   would throw the pen away and tear the paper up. Or, just when you are
   about to proceed to extremities with some poor soul who asks your
   mercy, if you could remember that you are now, even now, an heir of
   Heaven, I think you would say, "Lord, give me Grace to act according to
   my profession and not to stain the character I have assumed." Let "now"
   stay upon your mind with regard to your profession and the duty which
   it brings.

   Dear Friends, let me comfort your hearts by the remembrance that now,
   as a child of God, you are a possessor of present privileges. I do not
   know what your frame of mind may be this morning. You may have been
   very much tempted, you may feel, through some sickness of body,
   anything but cheerful. But if you believe in Christ, remember now you
   are a son of God and though it does not yet appear what you shall be,
   yet when He shall appear, you shall be like He, for you shall see Him
   as He is.

   At this very moment, I, a Believer in Christ, am completely
   pardoned--no spot of sin remains on me if I believe in Jesus. White as
   the newly-fallen snow is every soul that has been washed in the
   precious blood. Think of this delightful Truth of God, desponding
   Christian, and let your countenance be sad no more! Your eye of faith
   is dim, your evidences are very slender, your graces are at a low ebb,
   but you are completely forgiven, absolved and acquitted at this moment,
   if your soul rests upon the Rock of Ages! You are completely justified
   at this moment, despite your sins. Wearing your Savior's righteousness,
   you stand all beauteous in the eyes of God at this very moment--the
   words of Solomon to the spouse are the words of Christ to you though
   you are vexed with a thousand cares--"You are all fair My love: there
   is no spot in you."

   Covered with His righteousness and washed in His blood, even the pure
   and holy eyes of God can find no fault in you, and, as a consequence of
   this, you are this moment accepted! "He has not beheld iniquity in
   Jacob, neither has He seen perverseness in Israel." "Who shall lay
   anything to the charge of God's elect?" God does not look upon you with
   any anger. Though your heart may be struggling and tormented with sin,
   yet if you are resting upon God's Son, the love of God is flowing out
   to you in a stream which never can be stopped. Think of this sweet
   thought and let your soul be filled with the perfume of it! Loved of
   God now, the object of the almighty affection of the Blessed One are
   you NOW.

   No, more than this, you are not only accepted--you are in union with
   Christ now. Beloved Believer, can you realize it? You are a member of
   His body, of His flesh and of His bones! There is a vital union at this
   instant between you and the Lord of Glory! The life-blood flows from
   Him, the Head, to you. And at this moment, whether in your worst state
   of feeling or your best, you are now one with Jesus, by eternal
   union--ONE! I would to God we realized our present privileges! We are
   thinking about the Heaven that is to come and forgetting the Heaven
   below. The first we should do--but the second we should not leave
   undone. The men of Divine Grace find that the fruits of Paradise hang
   over the wall and they begin to pluck and eat them before they pass the
   gates of pearl. Come, Christian, "Now is the accepted time; behold, now
   is the day of salvation." Since Jesus is accepted, so you are even now.
   Live upon your present privileges and be glad!

   Remember that wherever there is present privilege there is also a
   present duty to be performed and so I touch a string which I made to
   sound just now. Since "now is the accepted time" with sinners, now is
   the accepted time for you to work, O Christian. I know what you intend
   to do--you have vast plans and machinery. My Brother, I do not care
   what you mean to do tomorrow, but I do care about what you intend to do
   today. Oh, those daydreams of ours! We are always intending in a year
   or two's time to be such valorous defenders of the faith, such good
   soldiers of Christ, such good winners of souls!

   My dear Brothers and Sisters, what are you doing now? There flies that
   moment! What does it bear upon its wings? Another drop of the stream of
   time is passed away--what action of yours is reflected on its crystal
   surface? Are you doing anything now? "I do not know," says one, "I do
   not know that I can do anything just now. When the service is bro- ken
   up, I may get home and then try to do something." I would pray you
   remember that, "now is the accepted time," and therefore seek now to
   get your heart warm. And when the service is over, think you hear the
   now, and begin to speak to those in the pew, or on the way home talk to
   any person you may meet with. And then, tomorrow, do not say, "Sunday
   is over and I cannot do any good on the week-day," but think you hear
   the clarion sound of this word now!

   You have a sister unsaved, pray for her now. You have a brother
   unconverted, write to him if you cannot speak to him and do it now.
   There is a court, a blind alley, which needs visiting. A dying man who
   needs instruction--do it now. Do you feel you have a talent? Use it
   now. You think you will have a better sphere in ten years' time? I pray
   you get a sphere now, for now is the day of salvation! I say again, I
   do not care what you do with your tomorrow. If you will but give God
   your now, your tomorrows will be all right. For duty, then, let the
   Christian prize the "now."

   One more thought. The Christian remembers that now he may die. What is
   his prospect now? Let him take courage. If his Lord should come now, he
   has his loins girt about and his lamp well trimmed and he is ready to
   enter into the supper. He will not be overtaken as by a thief, but his
   Lord, when He comes, shall find him watching--and should death come
   before the Advent, then he can say, "Now shall I enter into my rest.
   Now shall I see the face of my Lord Jesus without a veil to hide Him
   and I shall be with Him supremely blest."

   The glorious Advent or the bliss of Heaven is your prospect now! Not
   that you will go to Heaven if you die in twenty years' time--but if you
   die now--if the hand of death should take you in the street, or you
   should feel its numbing influence while you are in the pew! Now the
   celestial band shall bear you to the sublimities of Glory and introduce
   you to the Presence of Him whom you love! Now, Christian, rejoice, now
   labor, now live at the foot of the Savior's Cross!

   II. May the Master give us power on the second point to deal with "NOW"
   AS IT RESPECTS THE SINNER. The great mischief of most men is that they
   procrastinate. It is not that they resolve to be damned, but that they
   resolve to be saved tomorrow. It is not that they reject Christ
   forever, but that they reject Christ today. And truly they might as
   well reject Him forever, as continue perpetually to reject Him "now."

   Sinner, let me put your "now" before you as a man. You must soon pass
   away and be forgotten, like the flowers that withered in autumn and the
   insects which flitted through the summer hours. Now, then, is your time
   to think about eternity and to prepare yourself to meet your God. "See
   to your business first, James," said a careful father--"get a good
   trade and after that, look to your religion." There spoke a FOOL who
   knew not that infinite Wisdom has commanded, "Seek you first the
   kingdom of God and His righteousness. And all these things shall be
   added unto you." Would you give God the tail end of your life? Take
   care lest you have no old age at all! For many candles are blown out as
   soon as lit.

   Would you, as a lamb, be Satan's? And when you are withered and worn
   out, shall the lean skeleton of tottering weakness be brought and laid
   upon the altar? Be it not so! Let your flower be plucked in the bud and
   put into the hand of Jesus. God grant you Grace to seek Him in the days
   of your youth, for the promise is, "They that seek Me early shall find
   Me." As a man, I charge you, since there is only a "day of salvation"
   before the sun goes down and the black night of eternal ruin shall come
   upon you, lay hold upon the hope that is set before you!

   As a sinner, I also address you concerning this "now." Now is the day
   of salvation--you need it now. God is angry with you now. You are
   condemned already! It is not only the torment of Hell you have to
   dread, but if you have your senses, you would tremble at your present
   state. Now without God. Now without hope. Now an alien from the
   commonwealth of Israel! Now dead in trespasses and sins. Now in danger
   of the wrath to come! You need a Savior this morning, young man! Young
   woman, I do not charge you to store up medicine against the maladies of
   twenty years from now--it is the sickness of today of which I would
   gladly have you cured this very morning! It is not to look after a
   danger which shall press upon you when you grow old that I exhort you,
   but now you are on the brink of the precipice!

   Now, therefore, you need to be saved! And here comes the beauty of my
   text--as a sinner under the Gospel, I pray you to remember--"Now is the
   accepted time"! The most of my unconverted hearers do not believe this.
   I know what you are saying. You say, "I have had a great many thoughts
   about religion." But why do you not believe in Christ now? "Well," you
   say, "I will endeavor to think seriously of it." But what will be the
   result of your thinking? After you have thought ever so much, do you
   imagine you will think yourself into salvation? If the Gospel command
   were, "Think and be saved," I would cheerfully allow you a month's
   thinking. But the command is, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ," and,
   "Now is the accepted time."

   "But, Sir, I do not think such things should be done in a hurry." A
   hurry? What does David say? "I made haste and delayed not to keep Your
   commandments." A hurry? When a man is on the edge of damnation and on
   the borders of the grave? Do not talk of hurry, Sir--when it is a case
   of life and death. Let us fly swift as a flash of lightning. "Well, but
   I do not feel prepared." Do you think that disobeying God will make you
   more prepared? If you have lived a month without believing, you have
   lived a month in sin! Do you think when you have sinned more, you will
   be better prepared to obey the command which comes to you, "Believe now
   in the Lord Jesus Christ"? "Yes, but my heart feels so hard."

   Dear Friend, do you think you will be able to soften it between this
   and next week, or next month, or next year? Is there anything in the
   Word of God which leads you to believe that you can, in any way, soften
   your own heart? Is not this a mighty work of Grace? And when the text
   says, "Now is the accepted time," does not this suppose that even if
   you have a hard heart, still it is true that NOW is the accepted time?
   "Well, but," says one, "I do not feel convicted enough." That is to
   say, dear Friend, you do not think that "now is the accepted time." You
   think that another time when you get more convicted will be the
   accepted time.

   Here is a quarrel between God and you. He says "Now," you say, "No, no,
   it cannot be true! When I am more convicted, then will be the time." My
   dear Friend, are you not altogether mistaken? The likelihoods are that
   you never will be more convicted than now, if you are brought now to
   think upon these things. Your heart will certainly grow harder in the
   course of time--softer, never! I never heard the case of a man whose
   heart was made softer by delay. "Yes, but I should like to get home and
   pray." My text does not say it will be the accepted time when you get
   home and pray. It says, "Now!" And as I find you are "now" in this pew,
   "now" is the accepted time. If you trust Christ now, you will be
   ac-cepted--if now you are enabled to throw yourself simply into the
   hands of Christ--now is the accepted time between God and you.

   "Well," says another, "it does seem strange to think that I shall be
   saved this morning--there must be a little time occupied in it,
   surely?" The text says, "Now is the accepted time," it does not say,
   "There is an accepted time lasting through a period of weeks or months
   in which we pump ourselves up into a state of Grace." No! "Now," in a
   moment, acceptance is given. "But do you really mean it" says one,
   "that I, as I am, trusting Christ this morning, without any previous
   preparation whatever, shall be accepted?" My dear Friend, it is not
   what I mean--it is what the Scripture means. "Now is the accepted time;
   behold, now is the day of salvation." The moment a sinner trusts in
   Christ, he is saved and if you trust Him now, it is the day of
   salvation to you!

   Will you kindly look at that text--just open your Bibles now and look
   at it--you especially who are unconverted-- whether my hearers or
   readers! It has two fingerposts to point to it--two beholds. "Behold,
   now is the accepted time." Now, stop and look at that. Do you believe
   it? Say, "Yes," or "No." There is another "Behold." "Behold, now is the
   day of salvation." Do you believe that? I have asked you to look at the
   text, because I want you to look in its face and, if you dare, say,
   "That is a lie"--no, you do not dare say that! Then if you do not dare
   to say so, away must go, in a single moment, all those excuses which
   you make about a hard heart, not being convicted enough, praying,
   reading, preparing, and so on.

   Now, just as the clock ticks, not as an event to take place during a
   quarter of an hour, but in a moment the whole thing is done--"Now is
   the day of salvation." And what do you say to this? Does God the Holy
   Spirit now lead your soul to say, "Gracious Lord, I trust my soul with
   You now"? Oh, it is all done! Fly up to Heaven, angels! Bear the
   tidings! Tell the spirits who look down, anxiously watching for the
   spreading kingdom of the Savior, that another heir of Glory is born,
   another prodigal has returned to his Father's house! Now! Now! Now! O
   God, let conquering Grace get the victory!

   How my soul has longed over this text! And now when I get at it, I
   cannot handle it as I would. But, if I might, I would gladly take some
   of you by the hand--think that I have your hand now--and I would put
   this to you! I may never have another opportunity of preaching this
   text in your ears, for you may be gone before there is another season
   to hear. "Will you be made whole?" "Can you believe?" "If you can
   believe, all things are possible to him that believes." Old Na-bal said
   to David, "There are many servants nowadays that break away every man
   from his master." A bad old fellow, but he spoke a good sentence there
   without knowing it. Are there not some here who will break away from
   their old master?

   Are there not some who would gladly be servants of Christ and no longer
   servants of Satan? O Souls, if God has made you willing to break with
   Satan, to lay hold on Christ, this is not a day in which Christ will
   deny you, for He has expressly said He will accept you now, for, "Now
   is the accepted time." But, Sir, I am a harlot steeped up to the throat
   in vice." Still, "Now is the accepted time." Ah, but I have grown gray,
   Sir. I am seventy or eighty and have lived in sin all these years."
   Yes, but. "Now is the accepted time." Do you believe it or not? "Oh, I
   have refused the invitation a thousand times over." Yes, but still,
   still the abundant Grace of God says, "Now, is the accepted time." I
   would to God some of you would decide this very morning, this very
   morning in your pew where you are now sitting. Now, O Spirit of the
   living God, waken those whom You have chosen and set apart unto eternal
   life.

   I have not time now to dwell on the other two points. We will merely,
   therefore, hint at them.

   III. Now IN HEAVEN! Can you think of it? NOW in Heaven! They now
   delight in the society of Christ. They are now blest with communion
   with all the glorified spirits. They are now resting from their labors,
   their toils, their sufferings. They are now full of joys, while with
   their golden harps they sing. They are just now satisfied with the
   favor and full of the goodness of the Lord. They are now knowing what
   they knew not here, knowing even as they are known.

   They are now more than conquerors, waving their palm branches. They are
   now safely shut in from all fear of danger. They are now perfect,
   without taint of sin or remnant of corruption. They are now supremely
   blest. I merely point the finger where my wing cannot carry me and
   where my eyes cannot see. Such are your friends who have departed. Your
   wife is there now. Your little infant children are there. Your brother
   is there, your grandsire is there and we, if we should now die, blessed
   be the name of God, many of us should know what they know and taste
   what they enjoy in an instant!

   IV. But this is a dreary thought--Now IN HELL! Some of my hearers who
   listened to me last year and in the years that are past, are
   now--NOW--in Hell! Now, where no hope can come! Now, where no Gospel
   shall ever be preached! Now, where they bitterly regret their wasted
   Sabbaths and despised opportunities! Now, where memory holds a dreadful
   reign, reminding them of all their sins! Now, "Where their worm dies
   not, and the fire is not quenched"--where they gnaw their
   fire-tormented tongues in vain! Now, where God's fury is manifested to
   the full in Tophet's hideous fire!

   Now, where devils, once their tempters, become their tormentors! Now,
   where sinners who kept jovial company, help to increase the doleful
   misery of sighs and groans and weeping and gnashing of teeth! Now,
   accursed of God, accursed forever and ever! And within a moment, that
   may be the lot of every sinner here! Within the twinkling of an eye,
   there is not a man or woman among us out of Christ who may not know
   this. One drop of blood goes wrong--a thousand chances, as we say--may
   cause it and Hell is your portion.

   Every anatomist knows that hundreds of times in an hour, through the
   internal economy of the human frame, our life is in danger. No, there
   is not a second in which it is not so. "Great God! On what a feeble
   thread hang everlasting things!"--

   "Our life contains a thousand springs, And dies if one is gone. Strange
   that a harp of a thousand strings Should keep in tune so long."

   While we are in this danger, we are passing on to our doom--

   "We nightly pitch our moving tent A day's march nearer home." But where
   is that home to be with you unconverted ones?

   When the express trains first began to run to Scotland there was seen
   at the station, one evening, a gentleman tall and thin, whose cheek had
   the consumptive mark upon it. The porters asked him several questions
   about his luggage, of which there was a good deal. And when he had been
   asked several times by different persons, another came up and said,
   "Where are you going, Sir?" Being of short temper and in great haste,
   he said, "To Hell!" A servant of Christ passed by that moment and heard
   the answer. He sought to get in the same carriage and did so, but at
   the other end of it.

   Now this gentleman was talking very freely to different persons upon
   common topics and the man thought, "I will get a word in if I can." So
   he joined in the general tenor of the conversation till they alighted
   at a refreshment station, when, taking the opportunity, he said to the
   gentleman, "When do you expect to get to the end of your journey?"
   "Oh," said he, "I am going to cross at such-and-such a town by the boat
   tonight and hope to get to my journey's end about twelve o'clock
   tomorrow morning."

   The man said, "I think you misunderstand my question. You said when the
   porter asked you just now where you were going, that you were going to
   a very different place." "Ah, yes, I remember I did," said the
   gentleman, "but I am sometimes very hasty." The other said to him, "Was
   it true? Are you going to Hell? If so, when do you expect to get
   there?" And he began to talk to him about that sickness which he could
   see so certainly in his cheeks and warned him that unless he sought
   another road and fled to Christ, the only Refuge, he would certainly
   reach that dreadful end.

   There are some in this place, who if they were labeled this morning as
   to where they are going, would have to be directed "to Hell." You know
   that this is the case! And when will you get to your journey's end?
   Some here may live another fifty years. I pray God that that question
   of mine may haunt you and if it is never blessed to you before, may it
   be then--"When will you yet to your journey's end? When will you arrive
   in Hell?"

   This morning some of you may, in your hearts, say, "I am journeying
   there, but, by the Grace of God, I have come to a dead halt and not
   another inch will I go! Lord, make me ready to go to Heaven! Give me
   Grace now to trust the Savior that I may live." May God bless these
   feeble words of mine to His glory and your profit. Amen.

                        The Man With The Measuring Line

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 11, 1864, BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT
   THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "I lifted up my eyes again and looked and behold a man with a measuring
   line in his hand. So I said, Where are you going? And he said to me, To
   measure Jerusalem, to see what is its width and what is the length. And
   there was the angel who talked with me, going out; and another angel
   was coming out to meet him, who said to him, "Run, speak to this young
   man, saying, 'Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls
   because of the multitude of men and livestock in it. For I,' says the
   Lord, 'will be a wall of fire around her and I will be the glory in her
   midst.'" Zechariah 2:1-5.

   IT is evident that this vision and prophecy graciously reveal the
   future history of Jerusalem. You may spiritualize, if you will, and say
   that Jerusalem signifies the Church--but I pray you not forget the
   literal meaning of such words as these in the twelfth verse--"The Lord
   shall take possession of Judah as His inheritance in the holy land and
   will again choose Jerusalem." Jerusalem is spoken of and Jerusalem is
   meant. A man with a measuring line is about to measure the length and
   breadth of the city. He appears to be interrupted in his work by
   another angel who foretells that so greatly shall Jerusalem extend that
   she will be as a town without walls, for the number of men and
   livestock that shall be in it.

   This prophecy has not as yet been fulfilled--it may have had some
   partial fulfillment in those times of peace before the coming of the
   Savior, but even then Jerusalem was surrounded by a triple wall. And
   though it is true that there was a large suburban population, yet the
   city was not then, "as towns without walls," nor was the Glory of God
   in the midst of her in any eminent degree. I believe this passage
   refers to a happy and glorious future yet to come when the city of
   Jerusalem shall have no walls, except the protection of the Lord, but
   shall be extended far and wide.

   The Jewish people and their royal city shall remain the center of the
   manifestations of Divine Glory, just as the city of London still
   remains the center of the metropolis. But the nations of the earth
   shall be joined unto the Lord so that while Jerusalem remains the city
   of the Great King, the faithful among the people of all nations shall
   be, as it were, a suburban population to the chosen city and the
   kingdom of Messiah shall extend far and wide. Jerusalem will be rebuilt
   in more than her former splendor. The Jews will be restored to their
   own land. And Messiah will reign as a prince of the house of David.

   We cannot understand many portions of Scripture except upon this
   belief. If it is so, it appears according to this prophecy that God
   shall be the protection of this great city and the glory in the midst
   of her. All her sons shall be gathered from their distant wandering
   places. And where they have associated themselves with Antichrist, they
   shall hear the voice which says, "Deliver yourself, O Zion, that dwell
   with the daughter of Babylon." Christ Himself shall fulfill His
   promise, "Lo, I come." The nations shall be judged. God shall shake His
   hands over all lands and give them as a spoil to His people. Zion shall
   sing and rejoice--her Lord and King shall dwell in the midst of
   her--many nations shall join themselves to Jehovah and He, from shore
   to shore, shall reign while all flesh is silent before Him because He
   is raised up out of His holy habitation.

   I am not given to prophesying and I fear that the fixing of dates and
   periods has been exceedingly injurious to the whole system of
   pre-millennial teaching. But I think I clearly see in Scripture that
   the Lord Jesus Christ will come--so far I go and take my stand--that He
   will come personally to reign upon this earth. At His coming it appears
   clear to me that He will gather together the Jewish people. Jerusalem
   shall become the metropolis of the new empire which shall then extend
   from pole to pole, from the river even to the ends of the earth. If
   this is a correct interpretation of prophecy, you may read the whole of
   this chapter through and understand it--you have the key to every
   sentence! Without such a belief I see not how to interpret the
   Prophet's meaning.

   Dear Friends, we may sometimes refresh our minds with a prospect of the
   kingdom which is soon to cover all lands and make the sun and moon
   ashamed by its superior glory! We are not to indulge in prophesies as
   some do, making them their spiritual food, their meat and drink. But
   still we may take them as choice morsels and special delicacies set
   upon the table. They are condiments which may often give a sweeter
   taste, or, if you will, a greater pungency and savor to other
   doctrines. Prophetic views light up the crown of Jesus with a superior
   splendor.

   They make His Manhood appear illustrious as we see Him still in
   connection with the earth--to have a kingdom here as well as there--to
   sit upon a throne here as well as in yonder skies! To subdue His
   adversaries even upon this Aceldama, as in the realm of spirits! To
   make even this poor earth upon which the trail of the serpent is so
   manifest a place where the Glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all
   flesh shall see it together. If our view of prophecy is the correct
   one, it seems to be in perfect harmony with all the doctrines of the
   Gospel.

   God certainly did elect His people the Jews. He made a Covenant with
   His servant Abraham and although you will remind us that this was only
   a temporal covenant, I would remind you that it was the type of the
   spiritual one and it would be an unhappy reflection for us if the
   typical Covenant should prove to be only temporary as well as temporal!
   If that came to an end and if God cast away, in any sense, the people
   whom He did foreknow, it might foretell to us the ill foreboding that
   perhaps He might cast away His spiritual seed also--and that those who
   were chosen as the spiritual seed of Abraham might yet be cut off from
   the olive into which they had been grafted. If the natural branches are
   cast away forever, why not the grafted branches, too?

   But here is our joy--the God who swore unto His servant Abraham that to
   him and to his seed would He give the land forever has not gone back
   from His word--they shall possess the land. Their feet shall joyously
   tread its fruitful acres yet again. They shall sit, every man, under
   his own vine and under his own fig tree and none shall make them
   afraid. And so the spiritual seed to whom the spiritual heritage is
   given as by a Covenant of Salt shall also possess their heritage
   forever and of their rightful portion no robber shall despoil them.

   Now, I think it cannot be said that I have avoided the immediate
   meaning of the passage before us and that I have selected the vision as
   a text merely to accommodate it to my own purpose. You have now before
   you the intention and mind of the Spirit of God, so far as I am able to
   perceive it. And having spoken thus far upon it, I now feel at liberty
   to interpret the vision in what is commonly called a more spiritual
   sense, begging you, however, not to think that I make the spiritual
   sense override the sense I have already given, for the mind of the
   Spirit in the passage is ever to be respected far beyond any human
   accommodation.

   And though the accommodation may seem to be less historical and more
   suitable for Sunday food to the people of God, yet remember God's sense
   stands first and our sense is only to be regarded and respected as it
   stands in harmony with other portions of Holy Writ. My heart is so
   taken up with the present state of my Church and congregation that I
   feel moved to use my text in its application to us and I think it may
   well bear such an application. May God teach it and bless it to us!

   First, dear Friends, I want you to lift up your eyes with Zechariah and
   see the man with the measuring line. Secondly open your ears with
   Zechariah and hear the voice of the prophesying angel. And then,
   thirdly, I want you to go your ways and publish abroad the commands of
   this angel.

   I. First, then, LET US SEE THE MAN WITH THE MEASURING LINE IN HIS HAND.
   All Zechariah's visions are remarkably simple. They are not like
   Isaiah's when he saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted
   up. Nor or they like Ezekiel's when he beheld living creatures with
   four faces and wheels full of eyes. Zechariah had not imagination
   enough to be capable of beholding with due appreciation visions so
   complicated and mysterious. He was not the proper instrument of God for
   the Revelation of these more mysterious matters. But the Lord had a
   place for him and a vision for him, too.

   How sweet to be a servant of God in any position! He sees simply a man,
   an ordinary architect, going forth with a measuring line to measure the
   city of Jerusalem--a very simple sight--and without any stretch of the
   imagination you can all picture the man with his line. If this man in
   the text is to be viewed as an angel, commissioned by God to take
   measurements of that city, he would be sure to do it accurately and his
   measurements would be instructive, could he re- veal them to us. Since
   they are hidden from our eyes, let it be enough for us to perceive that
   the city has measurements-- has a settled length and breadth--and that
   the measurements can be taken and that we have Divine authority for
   asserting that they have been taken.

   This leads us to contemplate the doctrine of predestinating love, with
   its line of Divine Grace, and its plans of wisdom. God's city of
   Jerusalem is not to be built haphazardly. The line marks out and
   measures how long the wall shall be and where the corner shall be
   placed. And how far the other wall shall be carried and where it shall
   come to an end. The towers are counted, the bulwarks are considered.
   Every single item and particular of the sacred architecture of the
   Church of God is written down in the decree of the Most High. Every man
   has his plan and shall not the Most High God?

   He is esteemed to be a simpleton who begins to erect a building with no
   sort of idea how it will look at the end! Who, but a fool waits till
   the topstone is brought out before he conceives in his mind any sort of
   idea of what the building will be like? You would never employ a person
   without foresight as an architect. And if a man were foolish enough to
   do this with his own building, all who heard of it would make it the
   theme of laughter.

   It cannot be supposed, therefore, to be so with God! Your belief in His
   wisdom supposes that He has a plan, no, necessitates that there should
   be a design in the Divine mind! Moreover, you cannot separate the
   thought of Omniscience from God. If God is Omniscient, He knows the end
   from the beginning. He sees in its appointed place not merely the
   cornerstone which He has laid in fair colors--in the blood of His dear
   Son--but He beholds in their ordained position each of the chosen
   stones taken out of the quarry of nature and polished by His Grace! He
   sees the whole from corner to cornice, from base to roof, from
   foundation to pinnacle.

   He has in His mind a clear knowledge of every stone which shall be laid
   in its prepared space and how vast the edifice shall be and when the
   topstone shall be brought forth with shouts of, "Grace! Grace unto it!"
   Deny the decree of election and what do you see? You see the work of
   Grace without God's superintendence in it. What would creation be if
   God had not been absolutely present there? Can we conceive of a single
   creature formed without the creating purpose of God? Is there a fish in
   the sea, or a fowl in the air which was left to chance for its
   creation? No! In every bone, joint and muscle, sinew, gland and blood
   vessel you mark the Presence of God working everything according to the
   design of infinite Wisdom.

   Shall God be present in creation, ruling over all and not in Grace?
   Shall Grace be left in a state of chaos while creation is ordered by
   the Most High? Look at Providence! Who knows not that not a sparrow
   falls to the ground without your Father? Even the hairs of your head
   are all numbered. Every dark and bending line meets in the center of
   your love. It is our joy to believe that the measuring line is used in
   our trials and our troubles. If He ordained the number ten, who can
   make it eleven? If He filled the cup but half-full, even Satanic agency
   cannot fill it to the brim. God weighs the mountains of our griefs in
   scales and the hills of our tribulation in balances.

   And shall there be a God in Providence and not in Grace? What? Shall He
   ride in the chariot of the clouds and put a bit into the mouth of the
   tempest and rein in the wild steeds of the storm and yet shall He leave
   the greater work of His Grace--His third dominion, the grandest and the
   best--to the will of man, to the fickle choice of the creature? Shall
   He make the glorious salvation of Jesus an unsettled thing to be kicked
   about as a football by the free agency of man? Shall Divinity stand as
   lacquer to the creature's changeful choice? Never! He will have mercy
   on whom He will have mercy! He will have compassion on whom He will
   have compassion!

   And at the last it shall be seen that in every chosen vessel of mercy
   Jehovah did as He willed with His own. And in every separate instance
   of salvation and in every part and portion of the work of Grace the
   Lord reigned as King forever and did as He willed and glorified His own
   name. I see a man with a measuring line and I rejoice to see him and
   thank God that it is written, "The foundation of God stands sure,
   having this seal, The Lord knows them that are His." It is just
   possible that the man in the text was nothing but a man. At any rate,
   we may often see apparitions of men with measuring lines. And while I
   have an intense reverence to the angel with the measuring line, I must
   confess an entire dislike to the man with the measuring line.

   How often, Brethren, have we seen men with the measuring line
   endeavoring to estimate the length and breadth of God's true Church?
   Some of them take a very long line and they begin to calculate how many
   Protestants, Roman Catholics, and members of the Greek Church there may
   be throughout the world. Then they write down all these millions as
   being Christians! Now, we beg to differ from the estimate--how we wish
   we could agree with it!

   Glad enough should we be to hope that these were all true members of
   the Church of God! But when we remember the errors with which one
   section of the Church is polluted almost beyond hope. When we remark
   the absence of all spirituality in others. When we see how the mass of
   nominal Christians are living without God and without Christ. When we
   reflect upon the many criminals, harlots and open sinners who would,
   according to this rule, be called Christians, we beg to remind the man
   with the measuring line, "They are not all Israel which are of Israel"!
   And although they may all lie upon the threshing floor, "What is the
   chaff to the wheat? says the Lord." The field is the world, but among
   the wheat many tares are growing--multitudes are gathered here, not in
   the valley of decision, but in the plains of outward profes-sion--and a
   separating day must come!

   If we were to measure in this way, we should certainly be deluded--we
   should find Christians whom we could not trust! Christians who did not
   know their creed! Christians who did not rejoice in the name of
   Christ--Christians without faith, without hope and strangers to the
   commonwealth of Israel! Christians merely in name cannot be Christians,
   for, "Except a man is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."
   "He that believes on Him is not condemned: but he that believes not is
   condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only
   begotten Son of God."

   Again, I very frequently see another man with a measuring line. He is
   of a very sad countenance and looks out upon the universe through blue
   spectacles. He will never fall into the error of the first man but
   delights in the opposite extreme. "Oh," he says, as he wrings his hands
   in a kind of delicious misery, "the people of God are a handful, a
   remnant, a child might write them." He likes right well that hymn--

   "Dear Shepherd, of Your chosen few, Your former mercies here renew." He
   wishes his minister to preach from, "Fear not, little flock." Or this
   one, "Strait is the gate and narrow is the way, which leads unto life
   and few there are that find it." Sometimes Despondency takes the shape
   of a man's fearing that he himself shall not enter--now there is
   something humble about that and therefore it is bearable--but in
   frequent instances, Despondency is married to Pride and then it is not
   despondency about themselves, but about all the rest of the human
   family. They are doubtless the men and "wisdom will die with them."

   They hear of backsliders and they conclude that all professors will
   backslide. They have read a story of some famous minister who stained
   his character and they believe that all ministers are mere pretenders.
   They hear of Mr. Liberal, who was noted for his generosity and for his
   zeal in the cause of Christ and yet he turned out to be generous with
   other men's money and to be thought little better than a thief. And
   Despondency shakes her head and says, "I told you so--all men are
   liars." "Lord! Are there few who shall be saved?" is the constant
   question of Despondency.

   And every day she lives, she keeps making the measuring line a little
   shorter till perhaps the day will come when Despondency shall prophesy
   the destruction of the Christian faith, the return of the Papacy and
   the outpouring of the vials and say, "The faithful fail from among men,
   Zion is under a cloud." A day of clouds and of thick darkness, is the
   only description of the present age which this spirit allows to be
   correct. Perhaps Despondency herself may die in the dark, believing
   that she is not included in the line of the Covenant of Grace.

   Well, now, I must confess I am thankful that God has not set our
   desponding brother to measure His Zion! I am grateful that He is
   pleased to keep that in His own hands, or it might be woe forever to
   many of the brightest of the Lord's people. Certain men occasionally
   come across my path who carry a measuring line which was originally
   made either by one called Mr. False Experience or Mr. Proud Experience.
   These Brethren will not believe any to be Christians who have not
   experienced precisely the same emotions, doubts, fears, trembling,
   horrors, terrors, ecstasies, delights or raptures which they themselves
   have felt!

   They get hold of every Christian professor and they do with him as
   Procrustes did with men in his day--they take him into their bedchamber
   and there is their bed of experience--the exact length that it should
   be. If the Brother to be judged is not long enough to reach from head
   to foot, then they have a rack ready for him and they will pull his
   limbs a little. Or, if he should happen to be rather longer than
   themselves, then their pride is more aggrieved, still, and it is likely
   enough that a sharp two-edged sword of censure will take off his head
   so as to accommodate him to the length of the couch.

   Perhaps you know certain professors of this kind and if you live in
   their midst the only path of wisdom will be to hold your peace. They
   are supposed to have received information by special revelation from on
   high that their particular rut and that rut alone, leads to the land
   where sorrow is unknown. See them put on their spectacles and sit as a
   sort of jury to investigate a candidate for Church membership. This
   poor young man only professes to have been converted some three months.
   If they entertain his case at all it is with the decided determination
   ultimately to reject him. Thus they begin with him, "Have you ever
   experienced such-and-such law-work in your soul? Were you ever led to
   curse God and to feel the awful corruptions of your nature, tempting
   you to blaspheme the Holy Spirit?"

   The poor young man can only say he knows himself to be a sinner lost by
   nature and saved by Grace through faith in Christ. They shake their
   heads and tell him it is a mere natural, notional faith. As he has not
   known the law-work which they have known, he is of no good whatever.
   They pretend to hope for him but they mean all the while that they do
   not believe in him an atom.

   Another class of emotional religionists steer by another star. They
   question the enquirer from another catechism, "Have you been carried up
   to the third Heaven, like Paul? Can you say, 'Whether in the body, or
   out of the body, I cannot tell, God knows' "? Such Brethren sometimes
   will put such questions as this--"Do you feel any pleasure whatever
   when you are with your friends? Can you take a walk in the fields and
   find enjoyment in the singing of birds and in the foliage of the
   trees?" And if you answer, "Yes, thank God, I can," ah, they are
   sickened at you! You are not spiritually-minded, if you can look at
   works of art and admire them. If you can view the works of God in
   creation and feel any pleasure they are astonished at you and think you
   carnal!

   As for themselves, they have attained to such a superfine degree of
   spirituality that they have purified all the common sins out of
   themselves as well as the "sense." Dr. Watts says--

   "May purge ourselves from sense and sin, As Christ the Lord is pure."

   He meant by "sense" feeling, mere carnal feeling. But I am afraid that
   some have really purged themselves from sense in the ordinary
   acceptance of the term and might very well claim that their
   spirituality was not at all akin to worldly wisdom, for it is
   remarkably akin to absurdity and cant. Now, I thank God that the
   measuring line is not in the hands of the experimentalists and bless my
   Master that it is written, "Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ
   is born of God." And, "We know that we have passed from death unto life
   because we love the Brethren."

   I have also seen the measuring line in the hands of
   others--Doctrinalists. Yes. And their line has five marks which were
   originally made by John Calvin. And if your opinions do not square
   exactly to the standard, you are cut off from all part and lot in the
   blessings of vital godliness. Zion is certainly built according to the
   arrangement of the five points and therefore if any Brother or Sister
   does not comprehend and receive them all, he is not a weak Believer,
   but according to the measuring line of our rigid friends, he is not a
   Believer at all!

   You know, Brethren, that there is no soul living who holds more firmly
   to the Doctrines of Grace than I do and if any man asks me whether I am
   ashamed to be called a Calvinist, I answer, I wish to be called nothing
   but a Christian. But if you ask me do I hold the doctrinal views which
   were held by John Calvin, I reply, I do in the main hold them and
   rejoice to avow it. But, my dear Friends, far be it from me even to
   imagine that Zion contains none within her walls but Calvinistic
   Christians--or that there are none saved who do not hold our views.
   Most atrocious things have been spoken about the character and
   spiritual condition of John Wesley, the modern prince of Arminians. I
   can only say concerning him, that while I detest many of the doctrines
   which he preached, yet for the man himself I have a reverence second to
   no Wesleyan.

   And if there were wanted two Apostles to be added to the number of the
   twelve, I do not believe that there could be found two men more fit to
   be so added than George Whitfield and John Wesley. The character of
   John Wesley stands beyond all imputation for self-sacrifice, zeal,
   holiness and communion with God. He lived far above the ordinary level
   of common Christians and was one of whom the world was not worthy. I
   believe there are multitudes of men who cannot see these Truths of God,
   or, at least cannot see them in the way in which we put them, who
   nevertheless have received Christ into their hearts and are as dear to
   the heart of the God of Grace as the soundest Calvinist out of Heaven.

   I thank God we do not believe in the measuring line of any form of
   bigotry. I remember meeting with one who knew, yes, he knew how many
   children of God there were in the parish where he lived--there were
   exactly five. I was curious to know their names, and much to my
   amusement he began by saying, "There is myself." I stopped him at this
   point, with the query whether he was quite sure about the first one.
   Since then, his character has gone I know not where, but cer- tainly he
   will get on better without it than with it! Yet he was the first on his
   own list and a few others of his own black sort made up the five.

   There were in the other places of worship to which he did not go, men
   whose characters for integrity and uprightness, yes, and for
   spirituality and prayerfulness, would have been degraded by being put
   into comparison with him. And yet he, he was set as judge in Israel and
   was to know exactly how many people of God were in the village! Oh, I
   bless God that we have learned to have very little respect for the
   vision of the man with the measuring line! When we see an angel with
   it, if such is the intention of the vision, we are glad enough. "The
   Lord knows them that are His." But when we see a man with it, we tell
   him that he must give us a warrant from God and show us how he is to
   know the elect by any other method than that laid down in
   Scripture--"By their fruits you shall know them"!

   Notice that this vision soon departed. The Prophet does not seem to
   have dwelt long upon it. Almost as soon as it appeared it disappeared.
   Perhaps it is not a good thing for the people of God at any time to be
   much engaged in numbering the people. It is a question what was the
   particular sin of David in numbering the people. I will not enter into
   it just now, but I do fear that it is hard for us to number the people
   at any time without committing a sin--either the greatness of their
   number may lift us up and inflate us with pride or the littleness of
   their number may make us despond and doubt the strength of God.

   The vision of the man with the measuring line is only to be looked upon
   for a moment and then it may depart. We therefore ask you to close your
   eyes to that and open your ears to the voice of that Covenant angel,
   who, interrupting the man, began to tell Zechariah good things
   concerning times to come.

   II. From my text it appears, dear Friends, THAT WE ARE TO LOOK FOR A
   GREAT EXTENSION OF THE KINGDOM OF CHRIST. I hope we are to look for it
   now. Jerusalem shall be inhabited "as towns without walls." There are
   those in this place who remember when, if you crossed Blackfriars
   Bridge, you scarcely saw a house--as soon as you had crossed the bridge
   from London you were in the country at once. They still survive among
   us to see how this great city has not only swollen to this district,
   but has gone right on for miles and threatens to absorb mile after mile
   of the country.

   Such an extension we are to expect in Christ's Church. It began with
   twelve Apostles. It was soon swollen to some four hundred Brethren. It
   was increased by three thousand more at the day of Pentecost. There
   were added afterwards to the Church daily of such as should be saved.
   The Gospel was preached throughout all regions. The children of God
   were found in Athens and Corinth, in Derbe and Lystra--from all parts
   of the earth the elect were gathered in. The kingdom extended. The
   Gospel was preached in Spain as well as Italy. It passed on to Gaul, it
   came to Great Britain. In these after days it still continues to
   spread.

   A new world has been discovered, the religion of Jesus has been carried
   there. The emigrants who are peopling great islands of the southern
   seas bear with them the religion of Jesus Christ. Everywhere the
   kingdom grows. There is, as it were, a little core and center of
   Believers from among the Jewish people--but all around these there
   spreads a vast multitude of whom I might almost say that no man can
   number them. In our portion of Christ's Church it has been upon a small
   scale the same. Beginning with but a handful of men, God has been
   pleased to add hundred after hundred till He has extended our number to
   a great host.

   But I do trust that what it is now is only the nucleus around which
   there is to be built a yet mightier Church. I would to God that now He
   might open the windows of Heaven and pour us out a blessing and so
   multiply us that the present thousands of this Church might be
   altogether lost in the numbers yet added. Truly, I would not ask it for
   this Church alone, but that other Churches all around may derive health
   from our prosperity--that God may raise up out of our loins Churches
   which shall be our sons and daughters--which shall again beget
   spiritual children, so that the kingdom of Christ may come and His name
   be exalted in the land! We are to look for an extension.

   I want to encourage our elders and deacons and all our Brothers and
   Sisters to be looking for it. We have prayed for God's blessing--if
   ever a people prayed, we have. There has been an earnestness, I am
   sure, about the most of the Brethren here which cannot be without its
   reward. We have pleaded the name of Jesus even unto tears and God does
   not answer prayer if He does not send us a blessing! We have used His
   Son's name. We have pleaded His own promise. We have asked in faith,
   nothing doubting--and the blessing must come! Let us look for it and as
   sure as ever effect follows cause, so surely must we receive an
   extension of this Church!

   It appears from the vision that the supply for all the number shall be
   as great as is required. "Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without
   walls for the multitude of men and livestock in it." The livestock are
   the provisions for the population. What is to be done with so large a
   Church? How are the converts to be seen after? How are the members to
   be fed with spiritual food? "As your day, so shall your strength be."
   Whatever provision the Church shall want, God will give it.
   Jehovah-Jireh is His name! This city of London has not overgrown its
   supplies--while we may be astonished at the population, we may be
   equally astonished at the provision.

   It shall be so in the kingdom of Grace. God will raise up in the midst
   of any growing Church the proper men to look after the converts and see
   to their spiritual health. We have no need to be under any alarm in
   this respect--"All needful Grace will God bestow." Other friends are
   afraid that if there is so large an extension of the Church there will
   be many added to it who are not Believers and that consequently the
   Church may be increased, but not really strengthened. That too, is
   supplied in the text. "I, says the Lord, will be a wall of fire round
   her," both to keep out her enemies and to protect her from the incoming
   of false friends.

   It is the Church's duty to see to it that she admits not unworthy
   persons knowingly, but her best guard is the Presence of God. It is
   written, "Of the rest no man dared join himself unto them." You
   remember the death of Ananias and Sapphira? It came in opportunely,
   just at the time when the Church was rapidly increased. That solemn
   judgment set a wall of fire round about the Church so that ungodly
   persons dared not hypocritically come to be united with them. And so
   will God do to His Church now.

   The traveler, when he wishes to keep out the wild beasts, makes a ring
   of fire and then the lion is shut out. And God makes a ring of fire
   round His Church and the enemy is kept at a distance. China is said to
   be protected by a wall of stone. Old England is shielded by her wooden
   walls. But the Church of God has a better wall, still, for she has the
   Divine wall of fire! Her enemies cannot break through this to destroy
   the meanest of her citizens and her false friends shall say to
   themselves, "Who among us can dwell with the eternal burnings?" And so
   they shall keep back from a Church which is visibly sheltered and
   protected by the Presence of the Most High.

   Observe, dear Friends, while the Church is thus supplied and thus
   protected, she does not lack for glory. Her glory, however, does not
   lie in her numbers, nor in the provision made for them, but in the
   Presence of God. "I will be the glory in her midst." Let us never cease
   to pray for this. Let the Church distinctly recognize that the Holy
   Spirit is in the midst of the Church now. When we sing--"Come, Holy
   Spirit, heavenly Dove," we mean rightly enough. But the words must not
   be understood to mean that the Spirit of God is not here--for He is in
   the midst of His Church always and He dwells among His people as the
   Shekinah in the temple! And your bodies are the temples of the Holy
   Spirit--God dwells in you!

   Our prayer must be, "You that dwell between the cherubim, shine forth!
   Stir up Your strength and come and save us." The glory of a Church does
   not lie in the architecture of the place where she meets, nor in the
   eloquence of her minister, nor in the greatness of her number, nor the
   abundance of her wealth, nor the profundity of her learning. It lies in
   her God. "Let God arise, let His enemies be scattered." O God, when You
   went forth before Your people, when You marched through the wilderness,
   the earth shook! The heavens also dropped at the Presence of God--even
   Sinai itself was moved at the Presence of God, the God of Israel. Here,
   then, lies the Church's best hope! Let her make this the grand object
   of her prayer--that the Lord may be the glory in her midst!

   To close up this point let us observe that doubtless at such seasons,
   Divine love shall be very sweetly enjoyed among all the members. For
   the eighth verse says--though I do not intend to push our
   investigations further than the text-- "He that touches you, touches
   the apple of My eye." We never know so much of our nearness and
   dearness to God as when we, in common with the rest of God's people,
   are visited with the joy of His Presence. How differently things look
   in the sunshine from the way in which they appear without it! Ride
   along this land of ours when the rain is pouring down, or the mists
   have gathered and what a dull, dreary wilderness it seems.

   And these London streets! What a settlement for convicts they appear in
   the midst of our thick fogs! But let the sun shine forth as it did this
   morning! Let the mists be scattered, and then even the leafless trees
   have a golden light upon them and all nature rejoices and the meanest
   and poorest landscape becomes, after its sort, sublime! So when our
   hearts are dull and heavy and the Church of God is in the same state,
   how poor everything appears! But when the Lord shines forth and the Sun
   of Righteousness arises with healing in His wings, then the Doctrines
   of Grace, how precious! Then the ministry of the Gospel, how effectual!
   Then the means of Grace, how dear! The people of God, how estimable!
   The things of God, how delightful!

   O that we may have this! We have a right to expect it! We do not
   deserve it, but God has promised it! Let us give Him no rest till we
   have it! Stop your measuring, O Despondency! Stop your measuring, O
   Bigotry! Stop your censures, you who cut off the people of God and
   hearken while the angel prophesies that the kingdom of Christ shall
   grow and increase, till, like a city without walls, Jerusalem shall
   have for her glory the Presence of the Lord--and for her boundary
   nothing but the will of the Most High!

   III. I close with a few words on the third point and but a few. Where
   is this increase to come from, this great increase? It is to come from
   two sources indicated in the sixth and seventh verses. MULTITUDES ARE
   TO COME OUT OF THE WORLD. "Up, up! Flee from the land of the north,
   says the Lord, for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the
   Heaven, says the Lord." God's chosen people are scattered here and
   there. There are many of them in this assembly of whom we know
   nothing--but God knows them. The preaching of the Gospel is a message
   to you to come forth!

   That message is this: "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall
   be saved." It comes to every soul among you with this commanding, but
   most consoling word, "He that believes and is baptized shall be saved."
   My Hearers, you know what believing means. It is simply trusting upon
   what Christ has done for sinners. "Now is the accepted time, now is the
   day of salvation." If you now trust Him, your many sins shall be
   forgiven you! You are a child of God and an heir of Heaven if you but
   trust Him!

   Like prodigals you may have spent all your substance--spiritual hunger
   may have seized upon you--you would gladly fill your belly with the
   vain pleasures of the world, but you cannot. The Holy Spirit whispers
   in your heart, "Arise and go to your Father." Obey that heavenly
   whisper and though you are as yet a great way off, yet your Father sees
   you! He runs to meet you as you are! He falls upon your neck and kisses
   you, just as you are, undeserving and sinful. He cries to His servants,
   "Bring forth the best robe and put it on him." Will you trust that
   Father's love? Will you confide in it as it is set forth in the
   bleeding sacrifice of the Lord Jesus?

   It is from you, O unconverted men and women, that we expect the
   greatest increase through the Spirit's power. We are looking for it and
   praying for it. I hope that the people of God this morning will be
   looking after you and when this sermon is done I hope they will speak
   with you, or if they cannot do so, at least pray for you. "Up, up, come
   forth"-- twice the shout is given--as if you were slumberers and needed
   to be awakened. "Up, everyone that thirsts, come to the waters." Here
   there are two "ups," as if you should be called with vehemence, with
   earnestness, with pleading--"Come forth!" The year is almost over--I
   pray God that a new year may not be begun by you in sin, but may God
   begin with you at the fall of the year and bring you now to know His
   power to save.

   There is another class from which the Church is to get this increase,
   indicated in the next verse, "Deliver yourself O Zion, that dwell with
   the daughter of Babylon." There is a large number of this second class
   in this congregation. There are a number of you who believe in Christ
   but you dwell with the daughter of Babylon. If a census were taken of
   Christians according to the Church roll--and I do not know that it
   could be taken better by mortal man--then you must be put down as being
   of the world. When the Lord's Supper is spread and the Savior says, "Do
   this in remembrance of Me," you go away, or stay in the galleries.

   You practically say to the Lord Jesus, "Lord, I will not do this in
   remembrance of You. I feel myself justified in disobeying Your command.
   I believe I have a valid reason for not doing what Your loving lips
   request me to do." I do not know if I put it in that shape that you
   will quite agree with your own assertion, because how can a man really
   have a justifiable reason for not doing what the Lord Jesus Christ
   expressly tells him to do? That word "separation" needs to ring in the
   ears of Christians, "Come out from among them and be you separate, says
   the Lord and touch not the unclean thing."

   Though this is to be done practically by your actions, yet first and
   foremost it should be done by a distinct avowal of your Lord Jesus
   Christ and that avowal should be by Baptism and union with the Church.
   May God bless these remarks both to saints and sinners, for Jesus'
   sake. Amen.

                           Good Works In Good Company

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 18, 1864, BY C, H. SPURGEON, AT
   THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Come, my Beloved, let us go forth to the field. Let us lodge in the
   villages. Let us get up early to the vineyards. Let us see if the vine
   has budded, whether the grape blossoms are open and the pomegranates
   are in bloom. There will I give You my love. The mandrakes give off a
   fragrance, and at our gates are pleasant fruits, all manner new and
   old, which I have laid up for You, O my Beloved." Song of Solomon
   7:11-13.

   THE daughters of Jerusalem had been praising the Church as the fairest
   among women. They spoke of her with admiring appreciation, extolling
   her from head to foot. She wisely perceived that it was not easy to
   bear praise, and therefore she turned aside from the virgins to her
   Lord, making her boast not of her own loveliness, but of her being
   affianced to her beloved--"I am my Beloved's and His desire is toward
   me."

   Solomon has said, in his Book of Proverbs, "As the fining pot for
   silver and the furnace for gold so is a man to his praise," meaning to
   teach us that praise is a serious ordeal. Very many men can bear
   censure and abuse, for their spirit rises so superior to it all that
   they are even profited thereby. But to be flattered, or even duly
   honored, is not so easy a thing to endure. The sun's warm beams made
   the traveler unbind his coat when the wind made him wrap it the more
   closely about him--the warmth of praise may make us relax our
   integrity--unless we are very watchful.

   How many have been foolish enough, when standing upon a pinnacle, to
   look down and admire their own elevation and then their brain has
   reeled and they have fallen to their own shameful ruin? If we must at
   any time listen to the praises of our virtues. If we have served God so
   that the Church recognizes and rewards our usefulness, it is well for
   us to listen just as long as we are obliged to do, but no longer. And
   then let us turn aside at once to something more practical and more
   healthful to our own spirits.

   The spouse seems abruptly to break off from listening to the song of
   the virgins and turns to her own husband-Lord, communion with whom is
   ever blessed and ever profitable. She says to Him, "Come, my Beloved,
   let us go forth into the field." To lodge in communion with Christ is a
   certain cure for every ill. Whether it is the bitterness of woe, or the
   overindulgence of earthly delight, close fellowship with the Lord Jesus
   will take the gall from the one and the satiety from the other. Live
   near to Jesus, Christian, and it is matter of secondary importance
   whether you live on the mountain of honor or in the valley of
   humiliation.

   Live near to Jesus and the glowing coals of the furnace cannot consume
   you, nor the chill blasts of wintry affliction destroy you. Living near
   to Jesus you are covered with the wings of God and underneath you are
   the everlasting arms. If you read the three verses before us with
   attention, you will see that the Church all through anxiously desires
   fellowship with her Lord. It is, "Come with me," "let us." She will do
   nothing except as she is near to her beloved and in the enjoyment of
   His company.

   I think she desires three things in her words. First, she desires to
   practice self-examination--she would go and see whether the vine
   flourishes and whether the tender grape blossoms appear. But it is
   self-examination with Him. She desires next to go into active
   service--it is to this end that she would lodge in the villages and go
   among the tender plants, that she may labor there, but it is with
   Him--"Let us go!" "Come with me!" In the third place, she has a store
   of fruits laid up for Him. Some things done and some things
   doing--things old and new--but they are all for Him and she will not
   mention them except for Him, much less bring them out for them to be
   enjoyed by a rival. "They are laid up for You, O my Beloved."

   Let us try to make a personal matter of the text, this morning, and may
   God hear the desire of our hearts that we may have true fellowship with
   His own dear Son.

   I. First, then, IS THE MATTER OF SELF-EXAMINATION. This is a most
   desirable and important business, but every Believer should desire to
   have communion with Christ while he is attending to it.
   Self-examination is of the utmost importance. No trader who would wish
   to succeed would neglect to keep his books. No farmer who wishes to
   prosper would be careless as to the state of his fields. No
   flock-master who would see his herds abundantly increase would leave
   his servants to care for them and fail to tend them with a watchful
   eye. If you would have your business prosper, see to it carefully
   yourself.

   In soul-business it is of no use taking anything for granted where
   there are so many temptations to self-deception in our own
   hearts--where so many around us are deceived and are willing to help us
   to be deceived, too. And where Satan sedulously and craftily seeks to
   cry to us, "Peace, peace," where there is no peace--it is of the first
   and last importance that we should search ourselves whether we are in
   the faith and whether, being in the faith, our graces are growing, our
   faith increasing, and our love deepening.

   Well does the spouse suggest that she should see whether the vine
   flourishes, whether the tender grape blossoms have appeared and the
   pomegranates budded forth--our spiritual vineyard needs perpetual
   watchfulness. While you are attending to this important business, see
   to it at the same time that you keep up your communion with Christ, for
   you will never know so well the importance of self-examination as when
   you see Him! Mark Him there--fastened to the accursed tree--wearing the
   crown of thorns all set with ruby drops of His own blood! Look at His
   griefs--if repenting tears do not blind you! Behold His awful agonies!
   Gaze into that visage more marred than that of any man and stay awhile
   and listen to the heart-rending shriek, "Eloi! Eloi! Lama sabachthani?"
   And did Christ suffer all this that souls might be saved?

   Then surely, my Soul, it should be your chief business to see that you
   have an interest in Him. What? Shall I miss that which is purchased
   with such a price? When such a crimson stream from Christ's own heart
   flows to cleanse away sin, shall I think it a matter of no account
   whether I am cleansed or not? When that head which once was reverenced
   by angels, is now crowned with the thorns of mockery and cruelty, shall
   I not use all the thoughts of my head and brain to find out whether I
   am one with Christ, and a partaker of His passion? That cannot be a
   little heritage which Christ has purchased with such agonies--let me
   fear lest I should lose it!

   That cannot be a slight evil which cost my Savior such griefs--let me
   search myself to see whether I am delivered from it. I am sure,
   Beloved, you cannot have a better candle to look into the secret
   recesses of your soul than a candle lit at the fire of Jesus' love.
   Know His love for you and all His griefs on your behalf and you will
   charge your own heart after this fashion--"See to it that you make sure
   work as to your interest in Jesus--that you are really one with Him. Be
   sure that your faith in Him is genuine and that you shall be found in
   Him in peace at the day of His appearing."

   Self-examination, however, is very laborious work--the text hints at
   it. It does not say, "Let us go," but "Let us get up." Self-examination
   is ever up-hill work. It is by no means a pleasant task. It is one from
   which flesh recoils, for the flesh cries, "Let well enough alone! You
   are easy and comfortable! You have a hope which affords you much
   solace--do not dig too deep--the house stands well enough just as it
   is! Be not too anxious about the foundation--rest assured that it is
   all right--you would not have all these joys and present comforts if
   you had built upon sand."

   We need to school ourselves to perform a duty so irksome. But, Beloved,
   if we attempt to examine this, feeling that Christ is with us and that
   we are having communion with Him, we shall forget all the labor of the
   deed. There I see Him in the garden, sweating great drops of blood in
   prayer! Can I view Him prostrate on that cold winter's night (when the
   ground was hard with frost), so burning with His soul's travail that
   huge clots of blood-red gore are falling upon the frozen earth? And
   shall I think any toil too great to make sure of my interest in Him?

   Does He, when the cup is put to Him, say, "Not as I will, but as You
   will," and drink it up with resignation? And shall the far less bitter
   cup of self-examination, which is so much for my good, be refused by
   me? No, Savior of the world, I have not yet resisted unto blood
   striving against sin. But if it must be, if all my powers and members
   must be made to bleed, if my poor heart must be crushed as in a mortar,
   then let it be so that I may but be found one with You, washed in Your
   blood and covered with Your righteousness! Keep close to the Savior and
   the difficulties of self-examination will vanish and the labor will
   become light.

   Self-examination should always be very earnest work. The text says,
   "Let us get up early." It has been well observed that all men in
   Scripture who have done earnest work rose up early to do it. The dew of
   the morning, before the smoke and dust of the world's business have
   tainted the atmosphere, is a choice and special season for all holy
   work. In this passage getting up early signifies that the Church felt
   she must give her best hour to this necessary work. And as the work
   might be long, she gets up early that she may have a long day before
   her--that before the sun goes down she may have examined every vine and
   looked to every pomegranate and examined all the mandrakes of the
   garden.

   So must we set to work earnestly about self-examination. This is not
   child's play. If you would find out the trickery of your deceitful
   heart you must be very careful and watchful. If you would know on what
   foundation your hope is built, it is a laborer's work to dig out the
   rubbish and to find out where the foundation is laid. He who has to
   prove the title-deeds of his estate does not always find it an easy
   business--there are many manuscripts through which he must wade and
   numerous title-deeds to be read, verified and collated before the case
   will be clear.

   And so it must be with you. The great matter, "Do I believe in Jesus,"
   needs no hours of deliberation, for if I do not, I will now begin
   again. But to know the growing state of one's graces is not so easy.
   After all, you may be deceived. Therefore come to it with a soul all
   glowing with zeal, saying, in earnest prayer, "Search me, O God and
   know my heart: try me and know my thoughts: and see if there are any
   wicked ways in me and lead me in the way everlasting." Now I think
   there is nothing which can make you do this earnest work so well as to
   say to your Master and your Lord, "Lord, come with me." "While we
   examine ourselves, abide with us to help us in the work."

   I cannot be careless when I hear Christ say, "My meat and My drink is
   to do the will of Him that sent Me." I cannot be careless in my own
   Christian career when I see Him straining every nerve that He may run
   the race and win the crown for me! When I see Him sitting yonder, above
   all principalities and powers, pleading for my soul with never-ceasing
   intercession, I cannot be dull and sluggish! Wake up, you drowsy
   powers! Be stirred up, you sleeping passions, to examine yourselves
   anxiously and carefully, since Christ, for Zion's sake does not hold
   His peace and for Jerusalem's sake does not rest!

   And yet again, self-examination, it seems to me (I may be wrong), is
   not the simple work that some people think, but is beset with
   difficulties. I do believe that the most of self-examinations go on a
   wrong principle. You take Moses with you when you examine yourself and
   consequently you fall into despair. He who looks at his own character
   and position from a legal point of view will not only despair when he
   comes to the end of his reckoning, but he will be a wise man if he
   despairs not at the beginning! If we are to be judged on the footing of
   the Law, there shall no flesh living be justified. The very brightest
   members of Christ's family--those who wear the most of the Savior's
   image and honor Him best among men--may well shrink from the place
   where even Moses did "exceedingly fear and quake."

   O Brothers and Sisters, remember to take Jesus with you and not Moses,
   lest you dishonor the Grace of God and harbor suspicion against the
   faithfulness of God when you ought rather to have suspected yourself If
   I take Jesus with me, see on what different principles the examination
   is carried on! I do not ask, "Am I perfect?" That question Moses would
   suggest--"Am I perfect in myself?" But I ask, "Am I perfect in Christ
   Jesus?" That is a very different matter. I do not put it thus, "Am I
   without sin, naturally?" but thus--"Have I been washed in the fountain
   opened for sin and for uncleanness?"

   It is not, "Am I in myself well-pleasing to God?" but it is, "Am I
   accepted in the Beloved?" The Christian man sometimes looks at his
   evidences and grows ashamed of them and alarmed concerning his own
   salvation. "Why," says he, "my faith has unbelief in it! It is not able
   to save me!" Suppose he had looked at the Object of his faith instead
   of his faith? Then he would have said, "There is no failure in Him and
   therefore I am safe!" He looks at his hope--"Why," he says, "my very
   hope is marred and dimmed by an anxious carefulness about present
   things! How can I be accepted?" Yes, but if he had looked at the ground
   of his hope he would have seen that the promises of God stand sure and
   that whatever our hope may be, that promise never fails!

   Then he looks at his love--"Oh," he says, "surely I am condemned, for
   my love is so cold!" But if he had looked at Christ's love, he would
   have said "No, I shall never be condemned--for many waters cannot
   quench His love--neither can the floods drown it and, loving me as He
   does, He will never condemn me, nor cast me away." I do not want you to
   look at Christ so as to think less of your sin, but to think more of
   it! You can never see sin to be so black as when you see the suffering
   which Christ endured on its behalf--and I do desire, dear Friends, that
   you never look at sin apart from the

   Savior. If you gaze at the disease and forget the remedy, you will be
   driven to despair. If you look at the gathering gangrene and forget the
   all-gracious Surgeon who is able to remove it, you may well lie down
   and die!

   If you see your own emptiness and poverty and forget His fullness, you
   will never glorify His name. If you are lost in a sense of your own
   corruptions and forget the eternal glory which belongs to you in
   Christ, so that you are even now raised up together and made to sit
   together in heavenly places in Him--I say, if you forget this
   Grace-given brightness and only remember your native blackness--your
   spirit will turn aside from the path of faith and you will hang your
   harp upon the willows and fail to glorify your God.

   Examine yourselves, but let it be in the light of Calvary--not by the
   blazing fires of Sinai's lightning, but by the milder radiance of the
   Savior's griefs. Am I resting upon You, Son of God? Are Your wounds my
   hiding place? Have Your nails nailed me to Your Cross? Has Your spear
   pierced my heart and broken it with grief for sin? And am I now
   crucified with You to the world, buried with You to the power of sin,
   risen with You to newness of life and, like Yourself, waiting for the
   day of manifestation when sin, death and Hell shall be trod under foot
   and You shall be All in All? Come, let us look to the vines and
   pomegranates, but let us make sure that our Crucified Lord accompanies
   us! Otherwise we shall do the work amiss.

   It appears, from the words of the spouse, that the work of
   self-examination should be carried on in detail, if it is to be of real
   service. It is written, "Let us see if the vine has budded, whether the
   grape blossoms are opened and the pomegranates are in bloom." We must
   not take a general view of the garden, but particularize and give
   special attention to each point. If a candle is guarded on all sides,
   if there is but one place left open, the wind will find it out and blow
   out the light. So in self-examination, if we find ourselves right in
   many points, it is not enough--we must seek to be right in all points.

   The main thing is your faith. Is that faith simple? Does it depend upon
   Jesus only? Is it real? Is it an active, living faith? Does it work by
   love? Does it purify the soul? When you have examined faith, you may
   possibly make a mistake. Therefore go on to see what your love is. Do
   you love the Savior? Can you truly say, "The very thought of You fills
   my breast with rapture"? Can you hear the music of His name without
   feeling your blood leap in your veins? Oh, if you can, I think, dear
   Friend, you have reason for grave questioning. Try your active
   graces--go from one to the other and search them all. The worm may be
   at the root just in that part of the soil where you have not upturned
   the sod.

   One leak may sink a ship, therefore search well the vessel before you
   launch her upon the stormy deep. It is little by little that
   backsliders fall--even Judas does not betray his Master with a kiss at
   first. Men are schooled in the downward road. Let us be particularly
   anxious, therefore, that we do not fall little by little. And let us
   watch that we do not suffer small sins to get force and head, till,
   like little sparks, they have kindled a great fire!

   If you wish to be exact in prying into every part and corner you cannot
   do better than take Jesus with you. Tempted in all points like we are,
   He will know all the points in which we are tempted. And, while we are
   earnestly examining, His gracious finger will point out the spots where
   our weakness may lie and we shall thus fulfill the prayer we have often
   prayed--"Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me and know my
   thoughts: and see if there are any wicked ways in me and lead me in the
   way everlasting."

   When boys are at school and have to learn to write, every schoolmaster
   knows that at the first line they keep their eye upon the copy at the
   top. The next line they look at their own writing and their penmanship
   is not quite so good. And the next line they probably look at the last
   they have written and so they write worse and worse as they reach the
   bottom of the page because they have been imitating themselves and
   copying their own writing! It is well for the Christian if he does not
   fall into this mistake. He must keep his eyes upon his great Exemplar,
   not upon himself! He will be far more likely to see his own faults by
   looking to Christ than by looking at any of his own attainments.

   What a delightfully white thing this snow is! When it has newly fallen,
   take the whitest linen you may have ever seen and put it down--you will
   find it looks positively yellow by the side of it. Take the fairest
   sheet of paper that ever came from the mill and compare it. It does not
   look white at all. There is no whiteness, that I know of, which can at
   all emulate the heavenly whiteness of snow. So, if I put my character
   side by side with another man's, I may say of it, "It will bear
   comparison," but if I put it by the side of Christ's perfections--since
   His whole life is like the pure and spotless snow--I discover at once
   my own failures and spots.

   Oh, to have our great Pattern ever before our eyes! Jesus should not be
   a Friend who calls upon us now and then, but one with whom we walk
   forevermore. You have a difficult road to travel--see, O traveler to
   Heaven, that you go not without your Guide. You have to pass through
   the fiery furnace--enter it not, unless like Shadrach, Meshach and
   Abed-nego, there is a fourth with you like unto the Son of Man! You
   have to storm the Jericho of your own deceptions-- attempt not the
   scaling until, like Joshua, you have seen the Captain of the Lord's
   host with his sword drawn in his hand.

   You have to meet the Esau of your many temptations--meet him not until
   at Jabbok's brook you have laid hold of the angel and wrestled with him
   and prevailed. In every case, in every condition, you need Jesus! But
   most of all, when you come to deal with your own heart's eternal
   interests, O, keep close to Him! Lean your head upon His bosom! Ask to
   be refreshed with the spiced wine of His pomegranates and then there
   shall be no fear but that you shall be found of Him at the last,
   without spot, wrinkle, or any such thing. Seeing you have lived with
   Him and lived in Him here, you shall live with Him forever.

   II. THE CHURCH WAS ABOUT TO ENGAGE IN EARNEST LABOR and desires her
   Lord's company. It is the business of God's people to be trimmers of
   God's vines. Like our first parents, we are put into the garden of the
   Lord for usefulness. Observe that the Church, when she is in her right
   mind, in all her many labors desires to retain and cheerfully to enjoy
   communion with Christ. Some persons imagine that one cannot serve
   Christ actively and yet have fellowship with Him. I think they are very
   much mistaken.

   I confess it is very easy to get into Martha's position and to be
   cumbered with much serving. You may have to preach here and there so
   many times a week--to attend committees, to visit sick people and to do
   so many other things that you may really, unless you are
   careful--fritter away your own inward life in outward exercises. You
   may have to complain with the spouse, "They made me keeper of the
   vineyards, but my own vineyard have I not kept." I do not think,
   however, that there is any reason why this should be the case except
   through our own folly. Certain is it that a person may do nothing at
   all and yet grow quite as lifeless in spiritual things as those who are
   most busy.

   Mary was not praised for sitting still. No, but for sitting still at
   Jesus' feet! And so Christians are not to be praised if they neglect
   duties merely because they live in retirement and keep much at home--it
   is not sitting, I say, but sitting at Jesus' feet. Had Martha been
   sitting still, or had Mary been sitting anywhere else, I doubt not that
   the Master would have given a word of rebuke! He would never have said
   that mere sitting still was choosing the good part. Indeed, I know some
   of you who are none the better for doing nothing, but a great deal the
   worse! Those who do nothing grow sour and are always willing to find
   fault with the way in which others serve Christ.

   Do not think, therefore, that mere activity is, in itself, an evil--I
   believe it is a blessing. Taking a survey of Christ's Church you will
   find that those who have most fellowship with Christ are not the
   persons who are recluses or hermits-- who have much time to spend with
   themselves--but they are the useful indefatigable laborers who are
   toiling for Jesus and who in their toil have Him side by side with
   them. They are workers together with God. Let me, then, try to press
   this lesson upon you--that when we as a Church and each of us as
   individuals have anything to do for Christ--we must do it in communion
   with Him.

   We come up to His House and why do we come? It is said that among
   Church people the prayers are the main thing and among Dissenters the
   sermon. I believe that in both cases this would be a fault. Praying
   should not eclipse preaching! To preach or to listen to preaching is as
   true an act of worship as to pray. We never worship God better than
   when we hear His Word, reverently receive it and are moved thereby to
   love and gratitude. To hear preaching is, in a sense, praying, since
   the true effect of all preaching that is worth listening to draws us
   into a spirit of devotion and makes us ready for prayer and every other
   form of worship.

   But why do we come here? I am afraid there are some who come merely
   because it is the time to come--because the hour of worship has come
   round. And others come only because a certain preacher happens to stand
   upon the platform. Ah, this is not how God's own beloved ones come up
   to His House! They desire to meet with Him. Their prayer, as they tread
   the hallowed courts of God's House will be, "My heart and my flesh
   cries out for the living God." There is no hymn sung so well as when we
   really do praise Jesus in it. No prayer is so true as that prayer which
   really comes to the Mercy Seat and spreads itself before the All-Seeing
   God. There is no preaching like that which is full of Christ, which
   gives forth a savor of His good ointments.

   Worship is not to be commended because of the glorious swell of a
   Gregorian chant, or because of the equally majestic volume of sound
   which this great assembly may send forth from that sweet instrument,
   the human voice. A service is not to be commended because of the
   eloquence of the preacher or because of the display of learning which
   he is able to make in expounding his discourse. No, to the Christian it
   is, "Was the Master there?" The question on Sunday morning is, "What do
   you think, will He come up to the feast?" Coming to the Lord's Table,
   the child of God's business is not so much with the bread and the wine,
   as with His blood and with His flesh. May I feed on Him? May I see Him?
   And if I get to Him, then it is well with me.

   If I have then to serve God in the public engagements of His House, let
   me say, "Come, my Beloved, let us get up to the vineyards." You have
   other service to do, dear Friends. This afternoon many of you will be
   occupied with your Sunday school classes. There will be a knot of lads
   or girls around you. You will, perhaps, be conducting classes of
   hundreds of young men and young women. This evening, again, many will
   be occupied in preaching, or you will be engaged at home with your own
   children. Oh, how blessed it is to go to the classes, or into the
   pulpit, having the Master with you! It sometimes happens to the
   preacher that he is like the butcher at the block--he has a cleaver in
   his hand and cuts off large pieces of meat as food for those
   present--but he himself gets none.

   But it is otherwise with him when he has his Master with him! Then,
   whether the rest of the assembly are fed or not, certainly he himself
   is satisfied as with marrow and with fatness. After what a blessed sort
   the teacher can teach when the love of God is shed abroad in his heart!
   You will bear with the rudeness of those boys--you will put up with the
   inattention of those girls! You will not be angry at the folly of that
   youth--you will not forget to be in earnest with that poor
   wanderer--when Jesus Christ stands by your side!

   A vision of the Crucified, my Brethren, is that which we want! When we
   are toiling in His harvest field and sit down to wipe the sweat from
   our brow, we grow very weary. The harvest is plenteous, but the
   laborers are few--we feel that the edge of our sickle is growing very,
   very blunt and we wish we could lie down under the spreading tree from
   the heat of the sun and toil no longer. But just then we see the
   Crucified One coming forward with His mighty sickle and we mark the
   drops of blood streaming from His brow and see the nail prints in the
   hands with which He grasps the sickle.

   We see how He toils and how He labors! With what an awful love He
   sacrifices Himself--He has stripped off His very garments--and in all
   the nakedness of self-denial He gives Himself up that He may save
   others while Himself He cannot save. Then we pluck up our hearts again
   and take our sickle in the hands which once did hang down, saying,
   "Jesus, I will never be weary, for You were not weary. And when I shall
   be faint awhile, I will see You, whose meat and drink it was to do Your
   Father's will and I will make it my meat and my drink to serve You."
   Surely you cannot do God's work so well as when you have Jesus Christ
   with you!

   But it is possible, dear Friends, that some of you may be engaged in
   the service of winning for God some one soul. I know those who have one
   soul laid upon their heart. Perhaps it is the most solemn work under
   Heaven to have to pray for one soul. I have so many to look after that
   I cannot but feel I may rightly excuse myself from any very sedulous
   attention to one. But there are some of you who have only one person to
   look after--one child, one friend, one soul. You tried to talk to that
   one person the other day--you burst into tears when you heard the
   answer you received. You have been praying for months, but instead of
   seeing any answer to your prayer the person prayed for is growing
   worse! You are sure that he is never more vile than when you are most
   earnest.

   Friend, I should not wonder if Satan should whisper to you, "Give it
   up!" But let me, I pray you, urge you never to do so. And if you want
   something that will make you never to give up praying for that soul,
   see yonder, the eternal Son of God! He came into this world to save
   such a sinner as you yourself are! And you can never think you are
   doing anything too hard when trying to save your fellow man from
   destruction. O for a vision of the Savior's face covered with the
   spittle! See Him marred and bruised by the rough Roman soldiers! Behold
   Him as His back smarts beneath the thongs of the cruel whips! See Him
   as Pilate brings Him forth and cries, "Ecce homo."

   Mark Him as He treads the Via Dolorosa! See Him while they lift Him up
   on high and dislocate His bones! Why, what is all that you can endure
   compared with this? When your soul swells with fearful grief you do not
   feel such grief as this! You do but sip at the cup which the Savior
   drained to the dregs! You do but feel a scratch from those nails which
   went right through His hands! You do not have but for a moment a flesh
   wound from that spear which pierced His heart!

   Courage, solitary laborer--let Christ's griefs solace you. Come with
   me, my Beloved! Come with me, my Lord! And my toil shall be easy.

   There are some Christians engaged in works of heroism, works of
   peculiar daring for Christ. I should not like to be misunderstood, but
   I really think that amid the gross darkness of the Popish Church there
   have been some who have caught the true idea of Christian life far
   better than the most of us. Let me tell you what I mean. There have
   been some who have denied themselves all the comforts of life and have
   lived in suffering and poverty out of love to Jesus and from a sincere
   desire to benefit their fellow men.

   There have been produced in that Church men whose passionate love no
   labor or persecution could extinguish. They have fed the poor and
   nourished the sick. And women who have gone into the hospitals among
   diseases the most contagious and have risked life and lost life for the
   sake of nursing the sick. There are those living at this present moment
   upon the tops of such mountain passes as St. Bernard and the Simplon,
   spending the prime of their life in seclusion in inhospitable
   frost--where somebody must live--but where nobody ever would live if it
   were not for the sake of religion. They are there simply that they may
   serve the poor weary traveler when he comes wading through the snow, or
   is likely to be lost in a snow storm.

   No man shall take precedence of me in my abhorrence of the thrice
   accursed doctrines of the harlot of Rome! But from our enemies it is
   right to learn--and I do learn and would teach this--that self-denial
   and consecration are among the highest of the Christian virtues. I
   would to God that our people had the spirit of self-consecration in
   proportion to the light which they enjoy. I would to God we had true
   Sisters of Mercy who devoted themselves to going from house to house
   among the sick. We have some--but we need more--more who would be
   hospital nurses and who would count it but a small sacrifice even if
   they gave up themselves for the good of others.

   Missionaries we need who will face the malaria and deadly fever--our
   societies cry out for such--but very few are coming forward. We need
   men of substance who would take their substance and go out with it to a
   foreign land to evangelize. We need men who having prospered in
   business who would now count it an honor to spend the rest of their
   days in some new and special work of charity or piety. Oh, when I see
   the Savior in all His agonies doing so much for us I cannot but think
   that we as a Christian people do next to nothing for Him!

   There are no stakes of Smithfield now, thank God. There are no dungeons
   of the Lollard's Tower. No crowns of martyrdom for suffering brows--but
   there are still special spheres of labor where we could make the name
   of Christ illustrious. Let me hold up for your imitation some in modern
   times, who by works of faith and labors of love, have made us feel that
   the old spirit of Christianity is not dead. Our beloved friend, Mr.
   George Muller, of Bristol, for instance. There burns a holy
   devotedness, an intensity of faith, a fervor of perseverance which I
   would to God we all possessed! May we have more of this and so by
   keeping close to Jesus we shall produce better fruits, richer clusters
   and more luscious grapes than are commonly produced upon those vines
   which are in a less happy part of the vineyard.

   III. And now let me close by remaking that according to the text, THE
   CHURCH DESIRES TO GIVE TO CHRIST ALL THAT SHE PRODUCES. She has "all
   manner of pleasant fruits," both, "new and old," and they are laid up
   for her Beloved. We have some new fruits. This morning I hope we feel
   new life, new joy, new gratitude--we wish to make new resolves and
   carry them out by new labors. Our heart goes up in new prayers and our
   soul is pledging herself to new efforts.

   But we have some old things, too. There is our first love--a choice
   fruit that is! And Christ delights in it. There is our first
   faith--that simple faith by which, having nothing, we became possessors
   of all things! There is our joy when first we knew the Lord--let us
   revive it. How happy we were then, when the candle of the Lord shone
   round about us! Old things? Why we have the old remembrance of the
   promises. How faithful has God been! In that sickness of ours, how
   softly did He make our bed! In those deep waters, how placidly did He
   buoy us up! In that flaming furnace, how graciously did He deliver us
   so that not even the smell of fire passed upon us. Old fruits, indeed!
   We have many of them, for His mercies have been more than the hairs of
   our head.

   Old sins we must regret, but then we have had repentances, which He has
   given us, by which we have wept our way to the Cross and learned the
   merit of His blood. We have fruits, this morning, both new and old. But
   here is the point-- they are all to be for Christ. Do you not, after
   doing good service, detect yourself whispering, "I have done that
   well"? You intended that nobody should know it. You tried to do it as a
   secret act of devotion. You were half inclined to tell somebody when it
   was done, and though it came out, you say it was by accident. But you
   had a finger in that accident and you did not altogether regret that
   you had some of the honor of it.

   Do you not find when you are really serving your Master that if
   somebody does not pat you on the back, you grow cold? I know some
   Sunday school teachers, who, if they are looked after and encouraged,
   can do well, but who, if they have no encouragement, could not keep on
   in their work. Oh, it is so easy for us to preach when there are many
   souls being fed under us and the Master honors us in the eyes of men!
   Would it be quite as easy to serve Him without honor? I have known
   Brethren who have met with a little bad feeling among their people.
   Perhaps they have not always been able to keep their temper--and they
   have run away from their charge--left the sheep in the wilderness
   because in their inmost heart they were serving themselves, at least to
   a degree.

   Truly, Beloved, those are the best and most acceptable services in
   which Christ is the solitary aim of the soul--and His Glory without any
   mixture whatever is the end of all our efforts. Let your many fruits be
   laid up only for your Beloved--bring them forth when He is with
   you--bless His name for them. Put jewels into His crown, but never say,
   "Unto me be honor and unto my name be praise," but, "Sing unto Jesus,
   and to Jesus only be Glory while Heaven endures." O that strangers to
   Jesus would believe our testimony concerning Him!

   We are asked, sometimes for proofs of our religion. There is one proof
   which we defy anyone to contradict and this is the intense joy which
   the love of Christ gives to us. We are not fools, and I may add we are
   not dishonest--our witness is that there is a joy in love to Christ and
   in the enjoyment of His Presence! A joy which could not possibly have
   come to us from any but a Divine source!

   We do not speak because we have not tried other joys--some of us have
   had our fill of them. We can say of some that their sweet is soon lost
   in bitterness. Of others that they stale upon our taste. But communion
   with Christ has no aftertaste in it. It never grows stale. It is a sun
   without spots! It is a moon which never wanes! It is an ocean which
   never ebbs--it is a river which flows on forever--it is all Heaven and
   all bliss! Oh, if you did but know it you would never doubt again--your
   soul would rest implicitly upon Christ, whom God has set forth to be
   the Propitiation for sin! And, remember, if you rest upon Him and trust
   Him, you are saved and shall be with Him, where He is, to behold His
   Glory forevermore! May God bless these words for Jesus' sake. Amen.

                                  Mary'S Song

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 25, 1864, BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT
   THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And Mary said, My soul does magnify the Lord, and my spirit has
   rejoiced in God my Savior.'"

   Luke 1:46, 47.

   MARY was on a visit when she expressed her joy in the language of this
   noble song. It were well if all our social communion were as useful to
   our hearts as this visit was to Mary. "Iron sharpens iron, so a man
   sharpens the countenance of his friend." Mary, full of faith, goes to
   see Elizabeth, who is also full of holy confidence and the two are not
   long together before their faith mounts to full assurance and their
   full assurance bursts forth in a torrent of sacred praise!

   This praise aroused their slumbering powers and instead of two ordinary
   village women, we see before us two prophetesses and poetesses upon
   whom the Spirit of God abundantly rested. When we meet with our
   kinsfolk and acquaintance, let it be our prayer to God that our
   communion may be not only pleasant, but profitable. Let us pray that we
   may not merely pass away time and spend a pleasant hour, but may
   advance a day's march nearer Heaven and acquire greater fitness for our
   eternal rest!

   Observe, this morning, the sacred joy of Mary that you may imitate it.
   This is a season when all men expect us to be joyous. We compliment
   each other with the desire that we may have a "Merry Christmas." Some
   Christians who are a little squeamish do not like the word "merry." It
   is a right good old Saxon word, having the joy of childhood and the
   mirth of manhood in it. It brings before one's mind the old song of the
   midnight peal of bells, the holly and the blazing log.

   I love it for its place in that most tender of all parables, where it
   is written, that, when the long-lost prodigal returned to his father
   safe and sound, "They began to be merry." This is the season when we
   are expected to be happy. And my heart's desire is that in the highest
   and best sense, you who are Believers may be "merry."

   Mary's heart was merry within her--but here was the mark of her joy--it
   was all holy merriment, it was every drop of it sacred mirth. It was
   not such merriment as worldlings will revel in today and tomorrow, but
   such merriment as the angels have around the Throne of God, where they
   sing, "Glory to God in the highest," while we sing, "On earth peace,
   goodwill towards men." Such merry hearts have a continual feast.

   I want you, you children of the bride-chamber, to possess today and
   tomorrow, yes, all your days, the high and consecrated bliss of Mary
   that you may not only read her words but use them for yourselves, ever
   experiencing their meaning--"My soul does magnify the Lord and my
   spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior." Observe, first, that she sings.
   Secondly, she sings sweetly. Thirdly, shall she sing alone?

   I. First observe that MARY SINGS. Her subject is a Savior. She hails
   the Incarnate God. The long expected Messiah is about to appear. He for
   whom Prophets and princes waited long is now about to come--to be born
   of the virgin of Nazareth. Truly there was never a subject of sweeter
   song than this--the stooping down of Godhead to the feebleness of
   manhood! When God manifested His power in the works of His hands the
   morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy. But
   when God manifests Himself, what music shall suffice for the grand
   Psalm of adoring wonder?

   When wisdom and power are seen, these are but attributes. But in the
   Incarnation it is the Divine Person which is revealed wrapped in a veil
   of our inferior clay--well might Mary sing when earth and Heaven even
   now are wondering at the condescending Grace! Worthy of peerless music
   is the fact that "the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us." There is
   no longer a great gulf fixed between God and His people. The humanity
   of Christ has bridged it over. We can no more think that God sits on
   high indifferent to the wants and woes of men--for God has visited us
   and come down to the lowliness of our estate.

   We no longer need bemoan that we can never participate in the moral
   glory and purity of God, for if God in Glory can come down to His
   sinful creature, it is certainly less difficult to bear that creature,
   blood-washed and purified, up that starry way that the redeemed one may
   sit down forever on His Throne. Let us dream no longer in somber
   sadness that we cannot draw near to God so that He will really hear our
   prayer and pity our necessities seeing that Jesus has become bone of
   our bone and flesh of our flesh! He was born a babe as we are born,
   living a man as we must live, bearing the same infirmities and sorrows
   and bowing His head to the same death.

   O, can we not come with boldness by this new and living way and have
   access to the Throne of the heavenly Grace, when Jesus meets us as
   Immanuel, God with us? Angels sung, they scarcely knew why. Could they
   understand why God had become Man? They must have known that here was a
   mystery of condescension. But all the loving consequences which the
   Incarnation involved, even their acute minds could scarcely have
   guessed!

   But we see the whole and comprehend the grand design most fully. The
   manger of Bethlehem was big with Glory-- in the Incarnation was wrapped
   up all the blessedness by which a soul, snatched from the depths of
   sin, is lifted up to the heights of Glory. Shall not our clearer
   knowledge lead us to heights of song which angelic guesses could not
   reach? Shall the lips of cherubs move to flaming sonnets and shall we,
   who are redeemed by the blood of the Incarnate God, be treacherously
   and ungratefully silent?--

   "Did archangels sing Your coming?
   Did the shepherds learn their ways?
   Shame would cover me ungrateful,
   Should my tongues refuse to praise."

   This, however, was not the full subject of her holy hymn. Her peculiar
   delight was not that there was a Savior to be born, but that He was to
   be born of her! Blessed among women was she and highly favored of the
   Lord. But we can enjoy the same favor--no, we must enjoy it--or the
   coming of a Savior will be of no benefit to us. Christ on Calvary, I
   know, takes away the sin of His people. But none would have ever known
   the virtue of Christ upon the Cross unless they have the Lord Jesus
   formed in them as the hope of Glory!

   The stress of the virgin's canticle is laid upon God's special Grace to
   her. Those little words, the personal pronouns, tell us that it was
   truly a personal affair with her. "My soul does magnify the Lord and my
   spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior." The Savior was peculiarly and in
   a special sense, hers. She sung no "Christ for all," but "Christ for
   me," as her glad subject! Beloved, is Christ Jesus in your heart? Once
   you looked at Him from a distance and that look cured you of all
   spiritual diseases, but are you now living upon Him, receiving Him into
   your very vitals as your spiritual meat and drink?

   In holy fellowship you have oftentimes fed upon His flesh and been made
   to drink of His blood. You have been buried with Him in Baptism unto
   death. You have yielded yourselves a sacrifice to Him and you have
   taken Him to be a sacrifice for you. You can sing of Him as the spouse
   did, "His left hand is under my head and His right hand does embrace
   me. . . My beloved is mine and I am His: He feeds among the lilies."

   This is a happy style of living and anything short of this poor slavish
   work, oh, you can never know the joy of Mary unless Christ becomes
   truly and really yours! But oh, when He is yours, yours within,
   reigning in your heart! Yours controlling all your passions! Yours
   changing your nature, subduing your corruptions, inspiring you with
   hallowed emotions! When He is yours within, a joy unspeakable and full
   of Glory--oh, then you can sing, you must sing--who can restrain your
   tongue? If all the scoffers and mockers upon earth should bid you hold
   your peace, you must sing--your spirit must rejoice in God your Savior!

   We should miss much instruction if we overlooked the fact that the
   choice poem before us is a hymn of faith. As yet there was no Savior
   born, nor, as far as we can judge had the virgin any evidence such as
   carnal sense required to make her believe that a Savior would be born
   of her. How can this thing be, was a question which might very
   naturally have suspended her song until it received an answer
   convincing to flesh and blood. But no such answer had been given. She
   knew that with God all things are possible. She had His promise
   delivered by an angel and this was enough for her--on the strength of
   the Word which came forth from God her heart leaped with pleasure and
   her tongue glorified His name! When I consider what it is which she
   believed and how unhesitatingly she received the Word, I am ready to
   give her, as a woman, a place almost as high as that which Abraham
   occupied as a man!

   And if I dare not call her the mother of the faithful, at least let her
   have due honor as one of the most excellent of the mothers in Israel.
   The benediction of Elizabeth, Mary right well deserved, "Blessed is she
   that believes." To her the "sub- stance of things hoped for" was her
   faith and that was also her "evidence of things not seen." She knew, by
   the Revelation of God, that she was to bear the promised Seed who
   should bruise the serpent's head. But other proof she had none.

   This day there are those among us who have little or no conscious
   enjoyment of the Savior's Presence. They walk in darkness and see no
   light. They are groaning over inbred sin and mourning because
   corruptions prevail. Let them now trust in the Lord and remember that
   if they believe on the Son of God, Christ Jesus is within them. And by
   faith they may right gloriously chant the hallelujah of adoring love.
   Though the sun gleam not forth today, the clouds and mists have not
   quenched his light.

   And though the Sun of Righteousness shines not on you at this instant,
   yet He keeps His place in yonder skies and knows no variableness,
   neither shadow of a turning. If with all your digging the well springs
   not up, yet there abides a constant fullness in that deep which
   crouches beneath in the heart and purpose of a God of Love. What, if
   like David, you are much cast down, yet like he can you say unto your
   soul, "Hope in God, for I shall yet praise Him for the help of His
   countenance."

   Be glad then with Mary's joy--it is the joy of a Savior completely
   hers--but evidenced to be so, not by sense, but by faith. Faith has its
   music as well as sense, but it is of a more Divine sort--if the food on
   the table make men sing and dance, feastings of a more refined and
   ethereal nature can fill Believers with a hallowed plenitude of
   delight! Still listening to the favored virgin's canticle, let me
   observe that her lowliness does not make her stay her song. No, it
   imports a sweeter note into it--"For He has regarded the low estate of
   His handmaiden."

   Beloved Friend, you are feeling more intensely than ever the depth of
   your natural depravity. You are humbled under a sense of your many
   failings. You are so dead and earth-bound even in this House of Prayer
   that you cannot rise to God. You are heavy and sad, even while our
   Christmas carols have been ringing in your ears. You feel yourself to
   be today so useless to the Church of God, so insignificant, so utterly
   unworthy, that your unbelief whispers, "Surely, surely, you have
   nothing to sing for."

   Come, my Brother, come my Sister, imitate this blessed virgin of
   Nazareth and turn that very lowliness and meanness which you so
   painfully feel into another reason for unceasing praise! Daughters of
   Zion, sweetly say in your hymns of love, "He has regarded the low
   estate of His handmaiden." The less worthy I am of His favors, the more
   sweetly will I sing of His Grace! What if I am the most insignificant
   of all His chosen? Then will I praise Him who with eyes of love has
   sought me out and set His love upon me. "I thank You, O Father, Lord of
   Heaven and earth, that while You have hid these things from the wise
   and prudent, You have revealed them unto babes: even so, Father, for so
   it seemed good in Your sight."

   I am sure, dear Friends, the remembrance that there is a Savior and
   that this Savior is yours, must make you sing. And if you set side by
   side with it the thought that you were once sinful, unclean, vile,
   hateful and an enemy to God-- then your notes will take yet a loftier
   flight and mount to the third heavens to teach the golden harps the
   praise of God!

   It is right well worthy of notice that the greatness of the promised
   blessing did not give the sweet songster an argument for suspending her
   thankful strain. When I meditate upon the great goodness of God in
   loving His people before the earth was, in laying down His life for us,
   in pleading our cause before the Eternal Throne, in providing a
   paradise of rest for us forever--the black thought has troubled
   me--"Surely this is too high a privilege for such an insect of a day as
   this poor creature, man."

   Mary did not look at this matter unbelievingly--although she
   appreciated the greatness of the favor--she did but rejoice the more
   heartily on that account. "For He that is mighty has done to me great
   things." Come, Soul, it is a great thing to be a child of God, and your
   God does great wonders--therefore be not staggered through
   unbelief--but triumph in your adoption, great mercy though it is. Oh,
   it is a mighty mercy, higher than the mountains, to be chosen of God
   from all eternity, but it is true that even so are His redeemed chosen
   and therefore sing of it!

   It is a deep and unspeakable blessing to be redeemed with the precious
   blood of Christ, but you are so redeemed beyond all question. Therefore
   doubt not, but shout aloud for gladness of heart! It is a rapturous
   thought that you shall dwell above and wear the crown and wave the palm
   branch forever. Let no mistrust interrupt the melody of your Psalm of
   expectation, but--

   "Loud to the praise of love Divine, Bid every string awake.'

   What a fullness of the Truth of God is there in these few words--"He
   that is mighty has done to me great things." It is a text from which a
   glorified spirit in Heaven might preach an endless sermon!

   I pray you, lay hold upon the thoughts which I have in this poor way
   suggested to you and try to reach where Mary stood in holy exultation.
   The Grace is great, but so is its Giver. The love is infinite, but so
   is the heart from which it wells up. The blessedness is unspeakable,
   but so is the Divine Wisdom which planned it from of old. Let our
   hearts take up the Virgin's Magnificat and praise the Lord right
   joyously at this hour.

   Still further, for we have not exhausted the strain, the holiness of
   God has sometimes dampened the ardor of the Believer's joy. But not so
   in Mary's case. She exults in it--"And holy is His name." She weaves
   even that bright attribute into her song. Holy Lord! When I forget my
   Savior, the thought of Your purity makes me shudder! Standing where
   Moses stood upon the holy mountain of Your law, I do exceedingly fear
   and quake. To me, conscious of my guilt, no thunder could be more
   dreadful than the seraph's hymn of, "Holy! Holy! Holy! Lord God of
   Sabaoth." What is Your holiness but a consuming fire which must utterly
   destroy me--a sinner?

   If the heavens are not pure in Your sight and You charged your angels
   with folly, how much less, then, can You bear with vain, rebellious man
   that is born of woman? How can man be pure and how can Your eyes look
   upon him without consuming him quickly in Your anger? But, O Holy One
   of Israel, when my spirit can stand on Calvary and see Your holiness
   vindicate itself in the wounds of the Man who was born at Bethlehem,
   then my spirit rejoices in that glorious holiness which was once her
   terror!

   Did the thrice holy God stoop down to man and take man's flesh? Then
   there is hope, indeed! Did a holy God bear the sentence which His own
   Law pronounced on man? Does that holy God Incarnate now spread His
   wounded hands and plead for me? Then, my Soul, the holiness of God
   shall be a consolation to you. Living waters from this sacred well I
   draw. And I will add to all my notes of joy this one, "and holy is His
   name." He has sworn by His holiness and He will not lie. He will keep
   His Covenant with His Anointed and His seed forever.

   When we take to ourselves the wings of eagles and mount towards Heaven
   in holy praise, the prospect widens beneath us--even so as Mary poises
   herself upon the poetic wings, she looks down the long aisles of the
   past and beholds the mighty acts of Jehovah in the ages long back. Mark
   how her strain gathers majesty. It is rather the sustained flight of
   the eagle-winged Ezekiel, than the flutter of the timid dove of
   Nazareth.

   She sings, "His mercy is on them that fear Him from generation to
   generation." She looks beyond the captivity to the days of the
   kings--to Solomon, to David--along through the Judges into the
   wilderness, across the Red Sea to Jacob, to Isaac, to Abraham and
   onward, till, pausing at the gate of Eden, she hears the sound of the
   promise, "The Seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head." How
   magnificently she sums up the book of the wars of the Lord and
   rehearses the triumphs of Jehovah, "He has showed strength with His
   arm. He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts."

   How delightfully is mercy intermingled with judgment in the next canto
   of her Psalm--"He has put down the mighty from their seats and exalted
   them of low degree. He has filled the hungry with good things, and the
   rich He has sent empty away." My Brothers and Sisters, let us, too,
   sing of the past, glorious in faithfulness, fearful in judgment,
   teeming with wonders! Our own lives shall furnish us with a hymn of
   adoration. Let us speak of the things which we have made touching the
   King.

   We were hungry and He filled us with good things. We crouched upon the
   dunghill with the beggar and He has enthroned us among princes. We have
   been tossed with tempest, but with the Eternal Pilot at the helm, we
   have known no fear of shipwreck. We have been cast into the burning
   fiery furnace, but the Presence of the Son of Man has quenched the
   violence of the flames. Proclaim to all, O you daughters of music, the
   long tale of the mercy of the Lord to His people in the generations
   long departed!

   Many waters could not quench His love, neither could the floods drown
   it! Persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, sword--none of these have
   separated the saints from the love of God which is in Christ our Lord.
   The saints beneath the wings of the Most High have been ever safe! When
   most molested by the enemy they have dwelt in perfect peace--"God is
   their refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble."

   Plowing at times the blood red wave, the ship of the Church has never
   swerved from her predestined path of progress. Every tempest has
   favored her--the hurricane which sought her ruin has been made to bear
   her the more swiftly onward. Her flag has braved, these 1800 years, the
   battle and the breeze and she fears not what may yet be before her.
   But, lo, she nears the haven! The day is dawning when she shall bid
   farewell to storms. The waves already grow calm beneath her. The
   long-promised rest is near at hand--her Jesus Himself meets
   her--walking upon the waters!

   She shall enter into her eternal haven and all who are on board shall,
   with their Captain, sing of joy and triumph and victory through Him who
   has loved her and been her Deliverer! When Mary thus tuned her heart to
   glory in her God for His wonders in the past, she particularly dwelt
   upon the note of election. The highest note in the scale of my praise
   is reached when my soul sings, "I love Him because He first loved me."
   Well does Kent put it--

   "A monument of Grace, A sinner saved by blood. The streams of love I
   trace, Up to the fountain, God. And in His mighty breast I see, Eternal
   thoughts of love to me." We can scarcely fly higher than the source of
   love in the mount of God. Mary has the doctrine of election in her
   song--"He has put down the mighty from their seats and exalted them of
   low degree. He has filled the hungry with good things. And the rich He
   has sent empty away." Here is distinguishing Grace, discriminating
   regard! Here are some suffered to perish! Here are others, the least
   deserving and the most obscure, made the special objects of Divine
   affection! Do not be afraid to dwell upon this high doctrine, Beloved
   in the Lord. Let me assure you that when your mind is most heavy and
   depressed you will find this to be a bottle of richest cordial.

   Those who doubt these doctrines, or who cast them into the cold shade,
   miss the richest clusters of Eshcol. They lose the wines on the lees
   well refined, the fat things full of marrow. But you who by reason of
   years have had your senses exercised to discern between good and
   evil--you know that there is no honey like this--no sweetness
   comparable to it! If the honey in Jonathan's woods when but touched,
   enlightened the eyes to see, this is honey that will enlighten your
   heart to love and learn the mysteries of the kingdom of God!

   Eat and fear not overindulgence! Live upon this choice dainty and fear
   not that you shall grow weary of it for the more you know, the more you
   will want to know. The more your soul is filled, the more you will
   desire to have your mind enlarged that you may comprehend more and more
   the eternal, everlasting, discriminating love of God!

   But one more remark upon this point. You perceive she does not finish
   her song till she has reached the Covenant. When you mount as high as
   election, tarry on its sister mount, the Covenant of Grace. In the last
   verse of her song, she sings, "As He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham
   and to his seed forever." To her, that was the Covenant. To us who have
   clearer light, the ancient Covenant made in the council chamber of
   eternity is the subject of the greatest delight. The Covenant with
   Abraham was in its best sense only a minor copy of that gracious
   Covenant made with Jesus, the Everlasting Father of the faithful,
   before the blue heavens were stretched abroad.

   Covenant engagements are the softest pillows for an aching head.
   Covenant engagements with the Surety, Christ Jesus, are the best props
   for a trembling spirit!--

   "His oath, His Covenant, His blood, Support me in the raging flood.
   When every earthly prop gives way, This still is all my strength and
   stay." If Christ did swear to bring me to Glory and if the Father swore
   that He would give me to the Son to be a part of the infinite reward
   for the travail of His soul, then, my Soul, till God Himself shall be
   unfaithful, till Christ shall cease to be the Truth, till God's eternal
   council shall become a lie and the red roll of His election shall be
   consumed with fire, you are safe! Rest, then, in perfect peace, come
   what will! Take your harp from the willows and never let your fingers
   cease to sweep it to strains of richest harmony. O for Grace from first
   to last to join the Virgin in her song!

   II. Secondly, SHE SINGS SWEETLY. She praises her God right heartily.
   Observe how she plunges into the midst of the subject. There is no
   preface, but "My soul does magnify the Lord and my spirit has rejoiced
   in God my Savior." When some people sing, they appear to be afraid of
   being heard. Our poet puts it--

   "With all my powers of heart and tongue I'll praise my Maker in my
   song.
   Angels shall hear the notes I raise,
   Approve the song and join the praise."

   I am afraid angels frequently do not hear those poor, feeble, dying
   whispers which often drop from our lips merely by force of custom.

   Mary is all heart! Evidently her soul is on fire! While she muses, the
   fire burns. Then she speaks with her tongue. May we, too, call home our
   wandering thoughts and wake up our slumbering powers to praise
   redeeming love. It is a noble word that she uses here--"My soul does
   magnify the Lord." I suppose it means, "My soul does endeavor to make
   God great by praising Him." He is as great as He can be in His
   Being--my goodness cannot extend to Him. But yet my soul would make God
   greater in the thoughts of others and greater in my own heart.

   I would give the train of His Glory a wider sweep. The light which He
   has given me I would reflect. I would make His enemies His friends. I
   would turn hard thoughts of God into thoughts of love. "My soul would
   magnify the Lord." Old Trapp says, "My soul would make greater room for
   Him." It is as if she wanted to get more of God into her, like
   Rutherford, when he says, "Oh, that my heart were as big as Heaven,
   that I might hold Christ in it," and then he stops himself--"But Heaven
   and earth cannot contain Him. Oh, that I had a heart as big as seven
   heavens, that I might hold the whole of Christ within it."

   Truly this is a larger desire than we can ever hope to have gratified!
   Yet still our lips shall sing, "My soul does magnify the Lord." Oh, if
   I could crown Him! If I could lift Him higher! If my burning at the
   stake would but add a spark more light to His Glory, happy would I be
   to suffer! If my being crushed would lift Jesus an inch higher, happy
   were the destruction which should add to His Glory! Such is the hearty
   spirit of Mary's song!

   Again, her praise is very joyful--"My spirit has rejoiced in God my
   Savior." The word in the Greek is a remarkable one. I believe it is the
   same word which is used in the passage, "Rejoice you in that day and
   leap for joy." We used to have an old word in English which described a
   certain exulting dance, "a galliard." That word is supposed to have
   come from the Greek word used here. It was a sort of leaping dance. The
   old commentators call it a "levalto." Mary, in effect, declares, "My
   spirit shall dance like David before the ark, shall leap, shall spring,
   shall hound, shall rejoice in God my Savior."

   When we praise God it ought not to be with dolorous and doleful notes.
   Some of my Brethren praise God always on the minor key, or in the deep,
   deep bass--they cannot feel holy till they have the horrors. Why cannot
   some men worship God except with a long face? I know them by their very
   walk as they come to worship--what a dreary pace it is! How solemnly
   proper and funereal, indeed! They do not understand David's Psalm--

   "Up to her courts with joys unknown, The sacred tribes repair."

   No, they come up to their Father's house as if they were going to jail
   and worship God on Sunday as if it were the most doleful day in the
   week!

   It is said of a certain Highlander, when the Highlanders were very
   pious, that he once went to Edinburgh and when he came back again he
   said he had seen a dreadful sight on Sunday--he had seen people at
   Edinburgh going to Church with happy faces! He thought it wicked to
   look happy on Sunday--and that same notion exists in the minds of
   certain good people hereabouts. They fancy that when the saints get
   together they should sit down and have a little comfortable misery but
   little delight.

   In truth, moaning and pining is not the appointed way for worshipping
   God. We should take Mary as a pattern. All the year round I recommend
   her as an example to fainthearted and troubled ones. "My spirit has
   rejoiced in God my Savior." Cease from rejoicing in sensual things and
   with sinful pleasures have no fellowship--for all such rejoicing is
   evil-- but you cannot rejoice too much in the Lord! I believe that the
   fault with our public worship is that we are too sober, too cold, too
   formal. I do not exactly admire the ravings of our Primitive-Methodist
   friends when they grow wild. But I should have no objection to hear a
   hearty, "Hallelujah! "now and then.

   An enthusiastic burst of exultation might warm our hearts. The shout of
   "Glory!" might fire our spirits. This I know--I never feel more ready
   for true worship than when I am preaching in Wales--when the throughout
   whole sermon, the preacher is aided rather than interrupted by shouts
   of "Glory to God!" and "Bless His name!" Why, then, one's blood begins
   to glow and one's soul is stirred up! This is the true way of serving
   God with joy! "Rejoice in the Lord always. And again I say, Rejoice."
   "My spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior."

   She sings sweetly, in the third place, because she sings confidently.
   She does not pause while she sings to questions herself, "Have I any
   right to sing?" but no, "My soul does magnify the Lord and my spirit
   has rejoiced in God my Savior. For He has regarded the low estate of
   His handmaiden." "IF" is a sad enemy to all Christian happiness--"but,"
   "perhaps," "doubt," "surmise," "suspicion"--these are a race of
   highwaymen who waylay poor timid pilgrims and steal their spending
   money! Harps soon get out of tune and when the wind blows from the
   doubting quarter, the strings snap by the wholesale.

   If the angels of Heaven could have a doubt, it would turn Heaven into
   Hell. "If you are the Son of God," was the dastardly weapon wielded by
   the old enemy against our Lord in the wilderness. Our great foe knows
   well what weapon is the most dangerous. Christian, put up the shield of
   faith whenever you see that poisoned dagger about to be used against
   you!

   I fear that some of you foster your doubts and fears. You might as well
   hatch young vipers and foster the cockatrice. You think that it is a
   sign of Divine Grace to have doubts, whereas it is a sign of infirmity!
   It does not prove that you have no Grace when you doubt God's promise,
   but it does prove that you need more--for if you had more Grace, you
   would take God's Word as He gives it and it would be said of you as of
   Abraham, that, "he staggered not at the promise of God through
   unbelief, being fully persuaded that what He had promised He was able
   also to perform."

   God help you to shake off your doubts! Oh, these are devilish things!
   Is that too hard a word? I wish I could find a harder! These are
   felons. These are rebels, who seek to rob Christ of His Glory. These
   are traitors who cast mire upon the escutcheon of my Lord. Oh, these
   are vile traitors--hang them on a gallows, high as Haman's--cast them
   to the earth and let them rot like carrion, or bury them with the
   burial of an ass. Abhorred of God are doubts--abhorred of men let them
   be! They are cruel enemies to your souls! They injure your usefulness,
   they despoil you in every way. Smite them with the sword of the Lord
   and of Gideon! By faith in the promise seek to drive out these
   Canaanites and possess the land. O you men of God, speak with
   confidence and sing with sacred joy!

   There is something more than confidence in her song. She sings with
   great familiarity, "My soul does magnify the Lord and my spirit has
   rejoiced in God my Savior. For He that is mighty has done to me great
   things. And holy is His name." It is the song of one who draws very
   near to her God in loving intimacy. I always have an idea, when I
   listen to the reading of the Liturgy, that it is a slave's worship. I
   do not find fault with its words or sentences, perhaps of all human
   compositions the Liturgical service of the Church of England is, with
   some exceptions, the noblest.

   But it is only fit for slaves, or at the best for subjects. The whole
   service through one feels that there is a boundary set round about the
   mountain, just as at Sinai. Its Litany is the wail of a sinner and not
   the happy triumph of a saint! The service genders unto bondage and has
   nothing in it of the confident spirit of adoption. It views the Lord
   afar off, as One to be feared rather than loved and to be dreaded
   rather than delighted in. I have no doubt it suits those whose
   experience leads them to put the Ten Commandments near the communion
   table for they hereby evidence that their dealings with God are still
   on the terms of servants and not of sons.

   For my own part I want a form of worship in which I may draw near to my
   God and come even to His feet, spreading my case before Him and
   ordering my cause with arguments--talking with Him as a friend talks
   with his friend, or a child with its father--otherwise the worship is
   of little worth to me. Our Episcopalian friends, when they come here,
   are naturally struck with our service as being irreverent because it is
   so much more familiar and bold than theirs. Let us carefully guard
   against really deserving such a criticism and then we need not fear it.
   A renewed soul yearns after that very communion which the formalist
   calls irreverent!

   To talk with God as my Father--to deal with Him as with one whose
   promises are true to me and to whom I, a sinner washed in blood and
   clothed in the perfect righteousness of Christ may come with boldness,
   not standing afar off--I say this is a thing which the outer-court
   worshipper cannot understand. There are some of our hymns which speak
   of Christ with such familiarity that the cold critic says, "I do not
   like such expressions, I could not sing them." I quite agree with you,
   Sir Critic, that the language would not befit you, a stranger.

   But a child may say a thousand things which a servant must not. I
   remember a minister altering one of our hymns--

   "Let those refuse to sing Who never knew our God. But fa vorites of the
   hea venly King
   May speak their joys abroad."

   He sung it--"But subjects of the heavenly King." Yes. And when he sang
   it, I thought, "That is right. You are singing what you feel--you know
   nothing of discriminating Grace and special manifestations and
   therefore you keep to your native level, "subjects of the heavenly
   King." But oh, my heart wants a worship in which I can feel and express
   the feeling that I am a favorite of the heavenly king and therefore can
   sing His special love, His manifested favor, His sweet relationships,
   His mysterious union with my soul!

   You never get right till you ask the question, "Lord, how is it that
   You will manifest Yourself unto us and not unto the world?" There is a
   secret which is revealed to us and not to the outside world--an
   understanding which the sheep receive and not the goats. I appeal to
   any of you who during the week are in an official position--a judge,
   for instance. You have a seat on the bench and you wear no small
   dignity when you are there. When you get home there is a little fellow
   who has very little fear of Your Judgeship, but much love for your
   person! He climbs your knee. He kisses your cheek and says a thousand
   things to you which are meet and right enough as they come from
   him--but which you would not tolerate in court from any living man.

   The parable needs no interpretation. When I read some of the prayers of
   Martin Luther they shock me, but I argue with myself thus--"It is true
   I cannot talk to God in the same way as Martin, but then perhaps Martin
   Luther felt and realized his adoption more than I do and therefore was
   not less humble because he was more bold. It may be that he used
   expressions which would be out of place in the mouth of any man who had
   not known the Lord as he had."

   Oh my Friends, sing this day of our Lord Jesus as One near to us! Get
   close to Christ! Read His wounds! Thrust your hand into His side! Put
   your finger into the print of the nails and then your song shall win a
   sacred softness and melody not to be gained elsewhere. I must close by
   observing that while her song was all this, yet how very humble it was
   and how full of gratitude. The Papist calls her, "Mother of God," but
   she never whispers such a thing in her song. No, it is "God my Savior,"
   just such words as the sinner who is speaking to you might use, and
   such expressions as you sinners who are hearing me can use, too.

   She needs a Savior. She feels it. Her soul rejoices because there is a
   Savior for her. She does not talk as though she could commend herself
   to Him, but she hopes to stand accepted in the Beloved. Let us, then,
   take care that our familiarity has always blended with it the lowliest
   prostration of spirit when we remember that He is God over all, blessed
   forever and we are nothing but dust and ashes! He fills all things and
   we are less than nothing and vanity.

   III. The last thing was to be SHALL SHE SING ALONE? Yes, she must, if
   the only music we can bring is that of carnal delights and worldly
   pleasures. There will be much music tomorrow which would not chime in
   with hers. There will be much mirth tomorrow and much laughter and I am
   afraid the most of it would not accord with Mary's song. It will not
   be, "My soul does magnify the Lord and my spirit has rejoiced in God my
   Savior."

   We would not stop the play of the animal spirits in young or old. We
   would not abate one jot of your relish of the mercies of God, so long
   as you break not His command by wantonness, or drunkenness, or
   excess--but still, when you have had the most of this bodily exercise,
   it profits little--it is only the joy of the fleeting hour and not the
   happiness of the spirit which abides. And therefore Mary must sing
   alone, as far as you are concerned.

   The joy of the table is too low for Mary. The joy of the feast and the
   family grovels when compared with hers, but shall she sing alone?
   Certainly not, if this day any of us by simple trust in Jesus can take
   Christ to be our own! Does the Spirit of God this day lead you to say,
   "I trust my soul on Jesus?" My dear Friend, then you have conceived
   Christ--after the mystical and best sense of that word--Christ Jesus is
   conceived in your soul! Do you understand Him as the Sin-Bearer, taking
   away transgression? Can you see Him bleeding as the Substitute for men?

   Do you accept Him as such? Does your faith put all her dependence upon
   what He did, upon what He is, upon what He does? Then Christ is
   conceived in you and you may go your way with all the joy that Mary
   knew! And I was half ready to say, with something more--for the natural
   conception of the Savior's holy body was not one-tenth so meet a theme
   for congratulation as the spiritual conception of the holy Jesus within
   your heart when He shall be in you the Hope of Glory.

   My dear Friend, if Christ is yours, there is no song on earth too high
   or too holy for you to sing! No, there is no song which thrills from
   angelic lips, no note which thrills Archangel's tongues in which you
   may not join! Even this day the holiest, the happiest, the most
   glorious of words and thoughts and emotions belong to you. Use them!
   God help you to enjoy them. And His be the praise, while yours is the
   comfort evermore. Amen.
