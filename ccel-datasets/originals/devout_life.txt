Preface by the Author

   DEAR reader, I request you to read this Preface for your own
   satisfaction as well as mine.

   The flower-girl Glycera was so skilled in varying the arrangement and
   combination of her flowers, that out of the same kinds she produced a
   great variety of bouquets; so that the painter Pausias, [1] who sought
   to rival the diversity of her art, was brought to a standstill, for he
   could not vary his painting so endlessly as Glycera varied her
   bouquets. Even so the Holy Spirit of God disposes and arranges the
   devout teaching which He imparts through the lips and pen of His
   servants with such endless variety, that, although the doctrine is ever
   one and the same, their treatment of it is different, according to the
   varying minds whence that treatment flows. Assuredly I neither desire,
   nor ought to write in this book anything but what has been already said
   by others before me. I offer you the same flowers, dear reader, but the
   bouquet will be somewhat different from theirs, because it is
   differently made up.

   Almost all those who have written concerning the devout life have had
   chiefly in view persons who have altogether quitted the world; or at
   any rate they have taught a manner of devotion which would lead to such
   total retirement. But my object is to teach those who are living in
   towns, at court, in their own households, and whose calling obliges
   them to a social life, so far as externals are concerned. Such persons
   are apt to reject all attempt to lead a devout life under the plea of
   impossibility; imagining that like as no animal presumes to eat of the
   plant commonly called Palma Christi, so no one who is immersed in the
   tide of temporal affairs ought to presume to seek the palm of Christian
   piety.

   And so I have shown them that, like as the mother-of-pearl lives in the
   sea without ever absorbing one drop of salt water; and as near the
   Chelidonian Isles springs of sweet water start forth in the midst of
   the ocean; [2] and as the firemoth [3] hovers in the flames without
   burning her wings; even so a true stedfast soul may live in the world
   untainted by worldly breath, finding a well-spring of holy piety amid
   the bitter waves of society, and hovering amid the flames of earthly
   lusts without singeing the wings of its devout life. Of a truth this is
   not easy, and for that very reason I would have Christians bestow more
   care and energy than heretofore on the attempt, and thus it is that,
   while conscious of my own weakness, I endeavour by this book to afford
   some help to those who are undertaking this noble work with a generous
   heart.

   It is not, however, my own choice or wish which brings this
   Introduction before the public. A certain soul, abounding in
   uprightness and virtue, some time since conceived a great desire,
   through God's Grace, to aspire more earnestly after a devout life, and
   craved my private help with this view. I was bound to her by various
   ties, and had long observed her remarkable capacity for this
   attainment, so I took great pains to teach her, and having led her
   through the various exercises suitable to her circumstances and her
   aim, I let her keep written records thereof, to which she might have
   recourse when necessary. These she communicated to a learned and devout
   Religious, who, believing that they might be profitable to others,
   urged me to publish them, in which he succeeded the more readily that
   his friendship exercised great influence upon my will, and his judgment
   great authority over my judgment.

   So, in order to make the work more useful and acceptable, I have
   reviewed the papers and put them together, adding several matters
   carrying out my intentions; but all this has been done with scarce a
   moment's leisure. Consequently you will find very little precision in
   the work, but rather a collection of well-intentioned instructions,
   explained in clear intelligible words, at least that is what I have
   sought to give. But as to a polished style, I have not given that a
   thought, having so much else to do.

   I have addressed my instructions to Philothea, [4] as adapting what was
   originally written for an individual to the common good of souls. I
   have made use of a name suitable to all who seek after the devout life,
   Philothea meaning one who loves God. Setting then before me a soul, who
   through the devout life seeks after the love of God, I have arranged
   this Introduction in five parts, in the first of which I seek by
   suggestions and exercises to turn Philothea's mere desire into a hearty
   resolution; which she makes after her general confession, by a
   deliberate protest, followed by Holy Communion, in which, giving
   herself to her Saviour and receiving Him, she is happily received into
   His Holy Love. After this, I lead her on by showing her two great means
   of closer union with His Divine Majesty; the Sacraments, by which that
   Gracious Lord comes to us, and mental prayer, by which He draws us to
   Him. This is the Second Part.

   In the Third Part I set forth how she should practise certain virtues
   most suitable to her advancement, only dwelling on such special points
   as she might not find elsewhere, or be able to make out for herself. In
   the Fourth Part I bring to light the snares of some of her enemies, and
   show her how to pass through them safely and come forth unhurt. And
   finally, in the Fifth Part, I lead her apart to refresh herself and
   take breath, and renew her strength, so that she may go on more bravely
   afterwards, and make good progress in the devout life.

   This is a cavilling age, and I foresee that many will say that only
   Religious and persons living apart are fit to undertake the guidance of
   souls in such special devout ways; that it requires more time than a
   Bishop of so important a diocese as mine can spare, and that it must
   take too much thought from the important duties with which I am
   charged.

   But, dear reader, I reply with S. Denis that the task of leading souls
   towards perfection appertains above all others to Bishops, and that
   because their Order is supreme among men, as the Seraphim among Angels,
   and therefore their leisure cannot be better spent. The ancient Bishops
   and Fathers of the Primitive Church were, to say the least, as devoted
   to their duties as we are, yet they did not refuse to undertake the
   individual guidance of souls which sought their help, as we see by
   their epistles; thereby imitating the Apostles, who, while reaping the
   universal world-harvest, yet found time to gather up certain individual
   sheaves with special and personal affection. Who can fail to remember
   that Timothy, Titus, Philemon, Onesimus, Thekla, Appia, were the
   beloved spiritual children of S. Paul, as S. Mark and S. Petronilla
   were of S. Peter (for Baronius and Galonius have given learned and
   absolute proof that S. Petronilla was not his carnal but spiritual
   daughter). And is not one of S. John's Canonical Epistles addressed to
   the "elect lady" whom he loved in the faith?

   I grant that the guidance of individual souls is a labour, but it is a
   labour full of consolation, even as that of harvesters and
   grape-gatherers, who are never so well pleased as when most heavily
   laden. It is a labour which refreshes and invigorates the heart by the
   comfort which it brings to those who bear it; as is said to be the case
   with those who carry bundles of cinnamon in Arabia Felix. It is said
   that when the tigress finds one of her young left behind by the hunter
   in order to delay her while he carries off the rest of her cubs, she
   takes it up, however big, without seeming over-weighted, and speeds
   only the more swiftly to her lair, maternal love lightening the load.
   How much more readily will the heart of a spiritual father bear the
   burden of a soul he finds craving after perfection-- carrying it in his
   bosom as a mother her babe, without feeling weary of the precious
   burden?

   But unquestionably it must be a really paternal heart that can do this,
   and therefore it is that the Apostles and their apostolic followers are
   wont to call their disciples not merely their children, but, even more
   tenderly still, their "little children."

   One thing more, dear reader. It is too true that I who write about the
   devout life am not myself devout, but most certainly I am not without
   the wish to become so, and it is this wish which encourages me to teach
   you. A notable literary man has said that a good way to learn is to
   study, a better to listen, and the best to teach. And S. Augustine,
   writing to the devout Flora, [5] says, that giving is a claim to
   receive, and teaching a way to learn.

   Alexander caused the lovely Campaspe, [6] who was so dear to him, to be
   painted by the great Apelles, who, by dint of contemplating her as he
   drew, so graved her features in his heart and conceived so great a
   passion for her, that Alexander discovered it, and, pitying the artist,
   gave him her to wife, depriving himself for love of Apelles of the
   dearest thing he had in the world, in which, says Pliny, he displayed
   the greatness of his soul as much as in the mightiest victory. And so,
   friendly reader, it seems to me that as a Bishop, God wills me to frame
   in the hearts of His children not merely ordinary goodness, but yet
   more His own most precious devotion; and on my part I undertake
   willingly to do so, as much out of obedience to the call of duty as in
   the hope that, while fixing the image in others' hearts, my own may
   haply conceive a holy love; and that if His Divine Majesty sees me
   deeply in love, He may give her to me in an eternal marriage. The
   beautiful and chaste Rebecca, as she watered Isaac's camels, was
   destined to be his bride, and received his golden earrings and
   bracelets, and so I rely on the boundless Goodness of my God, that
   while I lead His beloved lambs to the wholesome fountain of devotion,
   He will take my soul to be His bride, giving me earrings of the golden
   words of love, and strengthening my arms to carry out its works,
   wherein lies the essence of all true devotion, the which I pray His
   Heavenly Majesty to grant to me and to all the children of His Church
   -- that Church to which I would ever submit all my writings, actions,
   words, will and thoughts.

     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER I. What true Devotion is.

   YOU aim at a devout life, dear child, because as a Christian you know
   that such devotion is most acceptable to God's Divine Majesty. But
   seeing that the small errors people are wont to commit in the beginning
   of any under taking are apt to wax greater as they advance, and to
   become irreparable at last, it is most important that you should
   thoroughly understand wherein lies the grace of true devotion;--and
   that because while there undoubtedly is such a true devotion, there are
   also many spurious and idle semblances thereof; and unless you know
   which is real, you may mistake, and waste your energy in pursuing an
   empty, profitless shadow. Arelius was wont to paint all his pictures
   with the features and expression of the women he loved, and even so we
   all colour devotion according to our own likings and dispositions. One
   man sets great value on fasting, and believes himself to be leading a
   very devout life, so long as he fasts rigorously, although the while
   his heart is full of bitterness;--and while he will not moisten his
   lips with wine, perhaps not even with water, in his great abstinence,
   he does not scruple to steep them in his neighbour's blood, through
   slander and detraction. Another man reckons himself as devout because
   he repeats many prayers daily, although at the same time he does not
   refrain from all manner of angry, irritating, conceited or insulting
   speeches among his family and neighbours. This man freely opens his
   purse in almsgiving, but closes his heart to all gentle and forgiving
   feelings towards those who are opposed to him; while that one is ready
   enough to forgive his enemies, but will never pay his rightful debts
   save under pressure. Meanwhile all these people are conventionally
   called religious, but nevertheless they are in no true sense really
   devout. When Saul's servants sought to take David, Michal induced them
   to suppose that the lifeless figure lying in his bed, and covered with
   his garments, was the man they sought; and in like manner many people
   dress up an exterior with the visible acts expressive of earnest
   devotion, and the world supposes them to be really devout and
   spiritual-minded, while all the time they are mere lay figures, mere
   phantasms of devotion.

   But, in fact, all true and living devotion presupposes the love of
   God;--and indeed it is neither more nor less than a very real love of
   God, though not always of the same kind; for that Love one while
   shining on the soul we call grace, which makes us acceptable to His
   Divine Majesty;--when it strengthens us to do well, it is called
   Charity;--but when it attains its fullest perfection, in which it not
   only leads us to do well, but to act carefully, diligently, and
   promptly, then it is called Devotion. The ostrich never flies,--the hen
   rises with difficulty, and achieves but a brief and rare flight, but
   the eagle, the dove, and the swallow, are continually on the wing, and
   soar high;--even so sinners do not rise towards God, for all their
   movements are earthly and earthbound. Well-meaning people, who have not
   as yet attained a true devotion, attempt a manner of flight by means of
   their good actions, but rarely, slowly and heavily; while really devout
   men rise up to God frequently, and with a swift and soaring wing. In
   short, devotion is simply a spiritual activity and liveliness by means
   of which Divine Love works in us, and causes us to work briskly and
   lovingly; and just as charity leads us to a general practice of all
   God's Commandments, so devotion leads us to practise them readily and
   diligently. And therefore we cannot call him who neglects to observe
   all God's Commandments either good or devout, because in order to be
   good, a man must be filled with love, and to be devout, he must further
   be very ready and apt to perform the deeds of love. And forasmuch as
   devotion consists in a high degree of real love, it not only makes us
   ready, active, and diligent in following all God's Commands, but it
   also excites us to be ready and loving in performing as many good works
   as possible, even such as are not enjoined upon us, but are only
   matters of counsel or inspiration. Even as a man just recovering from
   illness, walks only so far as he is obliged to go, with a slow and
   weary step, so the converted sinner journeys along as far as God
   commands him but slowly and wearily, until he attains a true spirit of
   devotion, and then, like a sound man, he not only gets along, but he
   runs and leaps in the way of God's Commands, and hastens gladly along
   the paths of heavenly counsels and inspirations. The difference between
   love and devotion is just that which exists between fire and
   flame;--love being a spiritual fire which becomes devotion when it is
   fanned into a flame;--and what devotion adds to the fire of love is
   that flame which makes it eager, energetic and diligent, not merely in
   obeying God's Commandments, but in fulfilling His Divine Counsels and
   inspirations.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER II. The Nature and Excellence of Devotion.

   THOSE who sought to discourage the Israelites from going up to the
   Promised Land, told them that it was "a land which eateth up the
   inhabitants thereof;" [7] that is, that the climate was so unhealthy
   that the inhabitants could not live long, and that the people thereof
   were "men of a great stature," who looked upon the new-comers as mere
   locusts to be devoured. It is just so, my daughter, that the world runs
   down true devotion, painting devout people with gloomy, melancholy
   aspect, and affirming that religion makes them dismal and unpleasant.
   But even as Joshua and Caleb protested that not only was the Promised
   Land a fair and pleasant country, but that the Israelites would take an
   easy and peaceful possession thereof, so the Holy Spirit tells us
   through His Saints, and our Lord has told us with His Own Lips, that a
   devout life is very sweet, very happy and very loveable.

   The world, looking on, sees that devout persons fast, watch and pray,
   endure injury patiently, minister to the sick and poor, restrain their
   temper, check and subdue their passions, deny themselves in all sensual
   indulgence, and do many other things which in themselves are hard and
   difficult. But the world sees nothing of that inward, heartfelt
   devotion which makes all these actions pleasant and easy. Watch a bee
   hovering over the mountain thyme;--the juices it gathers are bitter,
   but the bee turns them all to honey,--and so tells the worldling, that
   though the devout soul finds bitter herbs along its path of devotion,
   they are all turned to sweetness and pleasantness as it treads;--and
   the martyrs have counted fire, sword, and rack but as perfumed flowers
   by reason of their devotion. And if devotion can sweeten such cruel
   torments, and even death itself, how much more will it give a charm to
   ordinary good deeds? We sweeten unripe fruit with sugar, and it is
   useful in correcting the crudity even of that which is good. So
   devotion is the real spiritual sweetness which takes away all
   bitterness from mortifications; and prevents consolations from
   disagreeing with the soul: it cures the poor of sadness, and the rich
   of presumption; it keeps the oppressed from feeling desolate, and the
   prosperous from insolence; it averts sadness from the lonely, and
   dissipation from social life; it is as warmth in winter and refreshing
   dew in summer; it knows how to abound and how to suffer want; how to
   profit alike by honour and contempt; it accepts gladness and sadness
   with an even mind, and fills men's hearts with a wondrous sweetness.

   Ponder Jacob's ladder:--it is a true picture of the devout life; the
   two poles which support the steps are types of prayer which seeks the
   love of God, and the Sacraments which confer that love; while the steps
   themselves are simply the degrees of love by which we go on from virtue
   to virtue, either descending by good deeds on behalf of our neighbour
   or ascending by contemplation to a loving union with God. Consider,
   too, who they are who trod this ladder; men with angels' hearts, or
   angels with human forms. They are not youthful, but they seem to be so
   by reason of their vigour and spiritual activity. They have wings
   wherewith to fly, and attain to God in holy prayer, but they have
   likewise feet wherewith to tread in human paths by a holy gracious
   intercourse with men; their faces are bright and beautiful, inasmuch as
   they accept all things gently and sweetly; their heads and limbs are
   uncovered, because their thoughts, affections and actions have no
   motive or object save that of pleasing God; the rest of their bodies is
   covered with a light shining garment, because while they use the world
   and the things of this life, they use all such purely and honestly, and
   no further than is needful for their condition--such are the truly
   devout. Believe me, dear child, devotion is the sweetest of sweets, the
   queen of virtues, the perfection of love. If love is the milk of life,
   devotion is the cream thereof; if it is a fruitful plant, devotion is
   the blossom; if it is a precious stone, devotion is its brightness; if
   it is a precious balm, devotion is its perfume, even that sweet odour
   which delights men and causes the angels to rejoice.

CHAPTER III. Devotion is suitable to every Vocation and Profession.

   WHEN God created the world He commanded each tree to bear fruit after
   its kind; [8] and even so He bids Christians,--the living trees of His
   Church,--to bring forth fruits of devotion, each one according to his
   kind and vocation. A different exercise of devotion is required of
   each--the noble, the artisan, the servant, the prince, the maiden and
   the wife; and furthermore such practice must be modified according to
   the strength, the calling, and the duties of each individual. I ask
   you, my child, would it be fitting that a Bishop should seek to lead
   the solitary life of a Carthusian? And if the father of a family were
   as regardless in making provision for the future as a Capucin, if the
   artisan spent the day in church like a Religious, if the Religious
   involved himself in all manner of business on his neighbour's behalf as
   a Bishop is called upon to do, would not such a devotion be ridiculous,
   ill-regulated, and intolerable? Nevertheless such a mistake is often
   made, and the world, which cannot or will not discriminate between real
   devotion and the indiscretion of those who fancy themselves devout,
   grumbles and finds fault with devotion, which is really nowise
   concerned in these errors. No indeed, my child, the devotion which is
   true hinders nothing, but on the contrary it perfects everything; and
   that which runs counter to the rightful vocation of any one is, you may
   be sure, a spurious devotion. Aristotle says that the bee sucks honey
   from flowers without damaging them, leaving them as whole and fresh as
   it found them;--but true devotion does better still, for it not only
   hinders no manner of vocation or duty, but, contrariwise, it adorns and
   beautifies all. Throw precious stones into honey, and each will grow
   more brilliant according to its several colour:--and in like manner
   everybody fulfils his special calling better when subject to the
   influence of devotion:--family duties are lighter, married love truer,
   service to our King more faithful, every kind of occupation more
   acceptable and better performed where that is the guide.

   It is an error, nay more, a very heresy, to seek to banish the devout
   life from the soldier's guardroom, the mechanic's workshop, the
   prince's court, or the domestic hearth. Of course a purely
   contemplative devotion, such as is specially proper to the religious
   and monastic life, cannot be practised in these outer vocations, but
   there are various other kinds of devotion well-suited to lead those
   whose calling is secular, along the paths of perfection. The Old
   Testament furnishes us examples in Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, David,
   Job, Tobias, Sarah, Rebecca and Judith; and in the New Testament we
   read of St. Joseph, Lydia and Crispus, who led a perfectly devout life
   in their trades:--we have S. Anne, Martha, S. Monica, Aquila and
   Priscilla, as examples of household devotion, Cornelius, S. Sebastian,
   and S. Maurice among soldiers;--Constantine, S. Helena, S. Louis, the
   Blessed Amadaeus, [9] and S. Edward on the throne. And we even find
   instances of some who fell away in solitude,--usually so helpful to
   perfection,--some who had led a higher life in the world, which seems
   so antagonistic to it. S. Gregory dwells on how Lot, who had kept
   himself pure in the city, fell in his mountain solitude. Be sure that
   wheresoever our lot is cast we may and must aim at the perfect life.

CHAPTER IV. The Need of a Guide for those who would enter upon and advance in
the Devout Life.

   WHEN Tobias was bidden to go to Rages, he was willing to obey his
   father, but he objected that he knew not the way;--to which Tobit
   answered, "Seek thee a man which may go with thee:" [10] and even so,
   daughter, I say to you, If you would really tread the paths of the
   devout life, seek some holy man to guide and conduct you. This is the
   precept of precepts, says the devout Avila,--seek as you will you can
   never so surely discover God's Will as through the channel of humble
   obedience so universally taught and practised by all the Saints of
   olden time. When the blessed Teresa read of the great penances
   performed by Catherine of Cordova, she desired exceedingly to imitate
   them, contrary to the mind of her Confessor, who forbade her to do the
   like, and she was tempted to disobey him therein. Then God spoke to
   Teresa, saying, "My child, thou art on a good and safe road:--true,
   thou seest all this penance, but verily I esteem thy obedience as a yet
   greater virtue:"--and thenceforth S. Teresa so greatly loved the virtue
   of obedience, that in addition to that due to her superiors, she took a
   vow of special obedience to a pious ecclesiastic, pledging herself to
   follow his direction and guidance, which proved an inexpressible help
   to her. And even so before and after her many pious souls have
   subjected their will to God's ministers in order the better to submit
   themselves to Him, a practice much commended by S. Catherine of Sienna
   in her Dialogues. The devout Princess S. Elisabeth gave an unlimited
   obedience to the venerable Conrad; and one of the parting counsels
   given by S. Louis to his son ere he died was, "Confess thyself
   often,--choose a single-minded, worthy confessor, who is able wisely to
   teach thee how to do that which is needful for thee." [11] "A faithful
   friend," we are told in Holy Scripture, "is a strong defence, and he
   that hath found such an one hath found a treasure;" [12] and again: "A
   faithful friend is the medicine of life; and they that fear the Lord
   shall find him." [13] These sacred words have chiefly reference, as you
   see, to the immortal life, with a view to which we specially need a
   faithful friend, who will guide us by his counsel and advice, thereby
   guarding us against the deceits and snares of the Evil One:--he will be
   as a storehouse of wisdom to us in our sorrows, trials and falls; he
   will be as a healing balm to stay and soothe our heart in the time of
   spiritual sickness,--he will shield us from evil, and confirm that
   which is good in us, and when we fall through infirmity, he will avert
   the deadly nature of the evil, and raise us up again.

   But who can find such a friend? The Wise Man answers:--"He that feareth
   the Lord:" [14] that is to say, the truly humble soul which earnestly
   desires to advance in the spiritual life. So, daughter, inasmuch as it
   concerns you so closely to set forth on this devout journey under good
   guidance, do you pray most earnestly to God to supply you with a guide
   after His Own Heart, and never doubt but that He will grant you one who
   is wise and faithful, even should He send you an angel from Heaven, as
   He sent to Tobias.

   In truth, your spiritual guide should always be as a heaven-sent angel
   to you;--by which I mean that when you have found him, you are not to
   look upon him, or trust in him or his wisdom as an ordinary man; but
   you must look to God, Who will help you and speak to you through this
   man, putting into his heart and mouth that which is needful to you; so
   that you ought to hearken as though he were an angel come down from
   Heaven to lead you thither. Deal with him in all sincerity and
   faithfulness, and with open heart; manifesting alike your good and your
   evil, without pretence or dissimulation. Thus your good will be
   examined and confirmed, and your evil corrected and remedied;--you will
   be soothed and strengthened in trouble, moderated and regulated in
   prosperity. Give your guide a hearty confidence mingled with sacred
   reverence, so that reverence in no way shall hinder your confidence,
   and confidence nowise lessen your reverence: trust him with the respect
   of a daughter for her father; respect him with the confidence of a son
   in his mother. In a word, such a friendship should be strong and sweet;
   altogether holy, sacred, divine and spiritual. And with such an aim,
   choose one among a thousand, Avila says;--and I say among ten thousand,
   for there are fewer than one would think capable of this office. He
   must needs be full of love, of wisdom and of discretion; for if either
   of these three be wanting there is danger. But once more I say, ask
   such help of God, and when you have found it, bless His Holy Name; be
   stedfast, seek no more, but go on simply, humbly and trustfully, for
   you are safe to make a prosperous journey.

CHAPTER V. The First Step must be Purifying the Soul.

   "THE flowers appear on the earth," [15] says the Heavenly Bridegroom,
   and the time for pruning and cutting is come. And what, my child, are
   our hearts' flowers save our good desires? Now, so soon as these begin
   to appear, we need the pruning-hook to cut off all dead and superfluous
   works from our conscience. When the daughter of a strange land was
   about to espouse an Israelite, the law commanded her to put off the
   garment of her captivity, to pare her nails, and to shave her head;
   [16] even so the soul which aims at the dignity of becoming the spouse
   of Christ, must put off the old man, and put on the new man, forsaking
   sin: moreover, it must pare and shave away every impediment which can
   hinder the Love of God. The very first step towards spiritual health is
   to be purged from our sinful humours. S. Paul received perfect
   purification instantaneously, and the like grace was conferred on S.
   Magdalene, S. Catherine of Genoa, S. Pelagia, and some others, but this
   kind of purgation is as miraculous and extraordinary in grace as the
   resurrection of the dead in nature, nor dare we venture to aspire to
   it. The ordinary purification, whether of body or soul, is only
   accomplished by slow degrees, step by step, gradually and painfully.

   The angels on Jacob's ladder had wings, yet nevertheless they did not
   fly, but went in due order up and down the steps of the ladder. The
   soul which rises from out of sin to a devout life has been compared to
   the dawn, which does not banish darkness suddenly, but by degrees. That
   cure which is gradually effected is always the surest; and spiritual
   maladies, like those of the body, are wont to come on horseback and
   express, while they depart slowly and on foot. So that we must needs be
   brave and patient, my daughter, in this undertaking. It is a woeful
   thing to see souls beginning to chafe and grow disheartened because
   they find themselves still subject to imperfection after having made
   some attempt at leading a devout life, and well-nigh yielding to the
   temptation to give up in despair and fall back; but, on the other hand,
   there is an extreme danger surrounding those souls who, through the
   opposite temptation, are disposed to imagine themselves purified from
   all imperfection at the very outset of their purgation; who count
   themselves as full-grown almost before they are born, and seek to fly
   before they have wings. Be sure, daughter, that these are in great
   danger of a relapse through having left their physician too soon. "It
   is but lost labour to rise up early and late take rest," unless the
   Lord prosper all we do.

   The work of the soul's purification neither may nor can end save with
   life itself;--do not then let us be disheartened by our
   imperfections,--our very perfection lies in diligently contending
   against them, and it is impossible so to contend without seeing them,
   or to overcome without meeting them face to face. Our victory does not
   consist in being insensible to them, but in not consenting to them. Now
   to be afflicted by our imperfections is certainly not to consent
   thereto, and for the furtherance of humility it is needful that we
   sometimes find ourselves worsted in this spiritual battle, wherein,
   however, we shall never be conquered until we lose either life or
   courage. Moreover, imperfections and venial sins cannot destroy our
   spiritual life, which is only to be lost through mortal sin;
   consequently we have only need to watch well that they do not imperil
   our courage. David continually asks the Lord to strengthen his heart
   against cowardice and discouragement; and it is our privilege in this
   war that we are certain to vanquish so long as we are willing to fight.

CHAPTER VI. The First Purification, namely, from Mortal Sin.

   THE first purification to be made is from sin;--the means whereby to
   make it, the sacrament of penance. Seek the best confessor within your
   reach, use one of the many little books written in order to help the
   examination of conscience. [17] Read some such book carefully,
   examining point by point wherein you have sinned, from the first use of
   your reason to the present time. And if you mistrust your memory, write
   down the result of your examination. Having thus sought out the evil
   spots in your conscience, strive to detest them, and to reject them
   with the greatest abhorrence and contrition of which your heart is
   capable;--bearing in mind these four things:--that by sin you have lost
   God's Grace, rejected your share in Paradise, accepted the pains of
   Hell, and renounced God's Eternal Love. You see, my child, that I am
   now speaking of a general confession of your whole life, which, while I
   grant it is not always necessary, I yet believe will be found most
   helpful in the beginning of your pursuit after holiness, and therefore
   I earnestly advise you to make it. Not unfrequently the ordinary
   confessions of persons leading an everyday life are full of great
   faults, and that because they make little or no preparation, and have
   not the needful contrition. Owing to this deficiency such people go to
   confession with a tacit intention of returning to their old sins,
   inasmuch as they will not avoid the occasions of sin, or take the
   necessary measures for amendment of life, and in all such cases a
   general confession is required to steady and fix the soul. But,
   furthermore, a general confession forces us to a clearer selfknowledge,
   kindles a wholesome shame for our past life, and rouses gratitude for
   God's Mercy, Which has so long waited patiently for us;--it comforts
   the heart, refreshes the spirit, excites good resolutions, affords
   opportunity to our spiritual Father for giving the most suitable
   advice, and opens our hearts so as to make future confessions more
   effectual. Therefore I cannot enter into the subject of a general
   change of life and entire turning to God, by means of a devout life,
   without urging upon you to begin with a general confession.

   Communion" (Masters), "Manual for Confession," "Repentance," (Rev. T.
   T. Carter), "Hints to Penitents" (Palmer), Brett's "Guide to Faith and

   Soul," etc.

CHAPTER VII. The Second Purification, from all Sinful Affections.

   ALL the children of Israel went forth from the land of Egypt, but not
   all went forth heartily, and so, when wandering in the desert, some of
   them sighed after the leeks and onions,--the fleshpots of Egypt. Even
   so there are penitents who forsake sin, yet without forsaking their
   sinful affections; that is to say, they intend to sin no more, but it
   goes sorely against them to abstain from the pleasures of sin;--they
   formally renounce and forsake sinful acts, but they turn back many a
   fond lingering look to what they have left, like Lot's wife as she fled
   from Sodom. They are like a sick man who abstains from eating melon
   when the doctor says it would kill him, but who all the while longs for
   it, talks about it, bargains when he may have it, would at least like
   just to sniff the perfume, and thinks those who are free to eat of it
   very fortunate. And so these weak cowardly penitents abstain awhile
   from sin, but reluctantly;--they would fain be able to sin without
   incurring damnation;--they talk with a lingering taste of their sinful
   deeds, and envy those who are yet indulging in the like. Thus a man who
   has meditated some revenge gives it up in confession, but soon after he
   is to be found talking about the quarrel, averring that but for the
   fear of God he would do this or that; complaining that it is hard to
   keep the Divine rule of forgiveness; would to God it were lawful to
   avenge one's self! Who can fail to see that even if this poor man is
   not actually committing sin, he is altogether bound with the affections
   thereof, and although he may have come out of Egypt, he yet hungers
   after it, and longs for the leeks and onions he was wont to feed upon
   there! It is the same with the woman who, though she has given up her
   life of sin, yet takes delight in being sought after and admired. Alas!
   of a truth, all such are in great peril.

   Be sure, my daughter, that if you seek to lead a devout life, you must
   not merely forsake sin; but you must further cleanse your heart from
   all affections pertaining to sin; for, to say nothing of the danger of
   a relapse, these wretched affections will perpetually enfeeble your
   mind, and clog it, so that you will be unable to be diligent, ready and
   frequent in good works, wherein nevertheless lies the very essence of
   all true devotion. Souls which, in spite of having forsaken sin, yet
   retain such likings and longings, remind us of those persons who,
   without being actually ill, are pale and sickly, languid in all they
   do, eating without appetite, sleeping without refreshment, laughing
   without mirth, dragging themselves about rather than walking briskly.
   Such souls as I have described lose all the grace of their good deeds,
   which are probably few and feeble, through their spiritual languor.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VIII. How to effect this Second Purification.

   THE first inducement to attain this second purification is a keen and
   lively apprehension of the great evils resulting from sin, by means of
   which we acquire a deep, hearty contrition. For just as contrition, (so
   far as it is real,) however slight, when joined to the virtue of the
   Sacraments, purges away sin; so, when it becomes strong and urgent, it
   purges away all the affections which cling around habits of sin. A
   moderate, slight hatred makes men dislike its object and avoid his
   society; but when a violent, mortal hatred exists, they not only abhor
   and shun the person who excites it, but they loathe him, they cannot
   endure the approach of his relations or connexions, nor even his
   likeness or anything that concerns him. Just so when a penitent only
   hates sin through a weakly although real contrition, he will resolve to
   avoid overt acts of sin; but when his contrition is strong and hearty,
   he will not merely abhor sin, but every affection, every link and
   tendency to sin. Therefore, my daughter, it behoves us to kindle our
   contrition and repentance as much as we possibly can, so that it may
   reach even to the very smallest appearance of sin. Thus it was that the
   Magdalen, when converted, so entirely lost all taste for her past sin
   and its pleasures, that she never again cast back one thought upon
   them; and David declared that he hated not only sin itself, but every
   path and way which led thereto. This it is which is that "renewing of
   the soul" which the same Prophet compares to the eagle's strength. [18]

   Now, in order to attain this fear and this contrition, you must use the
   following meditations carefully; for if you practise them stedfastly,
   they (by God's Grace) will root out both sin and its affections from
   your heart. It is to that end that I have prepared them: do you use
   them one after another, in the order in which they come, only taking
   one each day, and using that as early as possible, for the morning is
   the best time for all spiritual exercises;--and then you will ponder
   and ruminate it through the day. If you have not as yet been taught how
   to meditate, you will find instructions to that purpose in the Second
   Part.

CHAPTER IX. FIRST MEDITATION.

   Of Creation.

   Preparation.

   1. PLACE yourself in the Presence of God. 2. Ask Him to inspire your
   heart.

   Considerations.

   1. Consider that but a few years since you were not born into the
   world, and your soul was as yet non-existent. Where wert thou then, O
   my soul? the world was already old, and yet of thee there was no sign.

   2. God brought you out of this nothingness, in order to make you what
   you are, not because He had any need of you, but solely out of His
   Goodness.

   3. Consider the being which God has given you; for it is the foremost
   being of this visible world, adapted to live eternally, and to be
   perfectly united to God's Divine Majesty.

   Affections and Resolutions.

   1. Humble yourself utterly before God, saying with the Psalmist, O
   Lord, I am nothing in respect of Thee--what am I, that Thou shouldst
   remember me? O my soul, thou wert yet lost in that abyss of
   nothingness, if God had not called thee forth, and what of thee in such
   a case?

   2. Give God thanks. O Great and Good Creator, what do I not owe Thee,
   Who didst take me from out that nothingness, by Thy Mercy to make me
   what I am? How can I ever do enough worthily to praise Thy Holy Name,
   and render due thanks to Thy Goodness?

   3. Confess your own shame. But alas, O my Creator, so far from uniting
   myself to Thee by a loving service, I have rebelled against Thee
   through my unruly affections, departing from Thee, and giving myself up
   to sin, and ignoring Thy Goodness, as though Thou hadst not created me.

   4. Prostrate thyself before God. O my soul, know that the Lord He is
   thy God, it is He that hath made thee, and not thou thyself. O God, I
   am the work of Thy Hands; henceforth I will not seek to rest in myself,
   who am nought. Wherein hast thou to glory, who art but dust and ashes?
   how canst thou, a very nothing, exalt thyself? In order to my own
   humiliation, I will do such and such a thing,--I will endure such
   contempt:--I will alter my ways and henceforth follow my Creator, and
   realise that I am honoured by His calling me to the being He has given;
   I will employ it solely to obey His Will, by means of the teaching He
   has given me, of which I will inquire more through my spiritual Father.

   Conclusion.

   1. Thank God. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and praise His Holy Name with
   all thy being, because His Goodness called me forth from nothingness,
   and His Mercy created me.

   2. Offer. O my God, I offer Thee with all my heart the being Thou hast
   given me, I dedicate and consecrate it to Thee.

   3. Pray. O God, strengthen me in these affections and resolutions. Dear
   Lord, I commend me, and all those I love, to Thy neverfailing Mercy.
   OUR FATHER, etc.

   At the end of your meditation linger a while, and gather, so to say, a
   little spiritual bouquet from the thoughts you have dwelt upon, the
   sweet perfume whereof may refresh you through the day.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER X. SECOND MEDITATION

   Of the End for which we were Created.

   Preparation.

   1. PLACE yourself before God. 2. Ask Him to inspire your heart.

   Considerations.

   1. God did not bring you into the world because He had any need of you,
   useless as you are; but solely that He might show forth His Goodness in
   you, giving you His Grace and Glory. And to this end He gave you
   understanding that you might know Him, memory that you might think of
   Him, a will that you might love Him, imagination that you might realise
   His mercies, sight that you might behold the marvels of His works,
   speech that you might praise Him, and so on with all your other
   faculties.

   2. Being created and placed in the world for this intent, all contrary
   actions should be shunned and rejected, as also you should avoid as
   idle and superfluous whatever does not promote it.

   2. Consider how unhappy they are who do not think of all this,--who
   live as though they were created only to build and plant, to heap up
   riches and amuse themselves with trifles.

   Affections and Resolutions.

   1. Humble yourself in that hitherto you have so little thought upon all
   this. Alas, my God, of what was I thinking when I did not think of
   Thee? what did I remember when I forgot Thee? what did I love when I
   loved Thee not? Alas, when I ought to have been feeding on the truth, I
   was but filling myself with vanity, and serving the world, which was
   made to serve me.

   2. Abhor your past life. I renounce ye, O vain thoughts and useless
   cogitations, frivolous and hateful memories: I renounce all worthless
   friendships, all unprofitable efforts, and miserably ungrateful
   self-indulgence, all pitiful compliances.

   3. Turn to God. Thou, my God and Saviour shalt henceforth be the sole
   object of my thoughts; no more will I give my mind to ideas which are
   displeasing to Thee. All the days of my life I will dwell upon the
   greatness of Thy Goodness, so lovingly poured out upon me. Thou shalt
   be henceforth the delight of my heart, the resting-place of all my
   affections. From this time forth I will forsake and abhor the vain
   pleasures and amusements, the empty pursuits which have absorbed my
   time;--the unprofitable ties which have bound my heart I will loosen
   henceforth, and to that end I will use such and such remedies.

   Conclusion.

   1. Thank God, Who has made you for so gracious an end. Thou hast made
   me, O Lord, for Thyself, that I may eternally enjoy the immensity of
   Thy Glory; when shall I be worthy thereof, when shall I know how to
   bless Thee as I ought?

   2. Offer. O Dearest Lord, I offer Thee all my affections and
   resolutions, with my whole heart and soul.

   3. Pray. I entreat Thee, O God, that Thou wouldest accept my desires
   and longings, and give Thy Blessing to my soul, to enable me to fulfil
   them, through the Merits of Thy Dear Son's Precious Blood shed upon the
   Cross for me. OUR FATHER, etc. Gather your little spiritual bouquet.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XI. THIRD MEDITATION.

   Of the Gifts of God.

   Preparation.

   1. PLACE yourself in the Presence of God. 2. Ask Him to inspire your
   heart.

   Considerations.

   1. Consider the material gifts God has given you--your body, and the
   means for its preservation; your health, and all that maintains it;
   your friends and many helps. Consider too how many persons more
   deserving than you are without these gifts; some suffering in health or
   limb, others exposed to injury, contempt and trouble, or sunk in
   poverty, while God has willed you to be better off.

   2. Consider the mental gifts He has given you. Why are you not stupid,
   idiotic, insane like many you wot of? Again, God has favoured you with
   a decent and suitable education, while many have grown up in utter
   ignorance.

   3. Further, consider His spiritual gifts. You are a child of His
   Church, God has taught you to know Himself from your youth. How often
   has He given you His Sacraments? what inspirations and interior light,
   what reproofs, He has given to lead you aright; how often He has
   forgiven you, how often delivered you from occasions of falling; what
   opportunities He has granted for your soul's progress! Dwell somewhat
   on the detail, see how Loving and Gracious God has been to you.

   Affections and Resolutions.

   1. Marvel at God's Goodness. How good He has been to me, how abundant
   in mercy and plenteous in loving-kindness! O my soul, be thou ever
   telling of the great things the Lord has done for thee!

   2. Marvel at your own ingratitude. What am I, Lord, that Thou
   rememberest me? How unworthy am I! I have trodden Thy Mercies under
   foot, I have abused Thy Grace, turning it against Thy very Self; I have
   set the depth of my ingratitude against the deep of Thy Grace and
   Favour.

   3. Kindle your gratitude. O my soul, be no more so faithless and
   disloyal to thy mighty Benefactor! How should not my whole soul serve
   the Lord, Who has done such great things in me and for me?

   4. Go on, my daughter, to refrain from this or that material
   indulgence; let your body be wholly the servant of God, Who has done so
   much for it: set your soul to seek Him by this or that devout practice
   suitable thereto. Make diligent use of the means provided by the Church
   to help you to love God and save your soul. Resolve to be constant in
   prayer and seeking the Sacraments, in hearing God's Word, and in
   obeying His inspirations and counsels.

   Conclusion.

   1. Thank God for the clearer knowledge He has given you of His benefits
   and your own duty.

   2. Offer your heart and all its resolutions to Him.

   3. Ask Him to strengthen you to fulfil them faithfully by the Merits of
   the Death of His Son. OUR FATHER, etc. Gather the little spiritual
   bouquet.

CHAPTER XII. FOURTH MEDITATION.

   On Sin.

   Preparation.

   1. PLACE yourself in the Presence of God. 2. Ask Him to inspire your
   heart.

   Considerations.

   1. Consider how long it is since you first began to commit sin, and how
   since that first beginning sin has multiplied in your heart; how every
   day has added to the number of your sins against God, against yourself
   and against your neighbour, by deed, word, thought and desire.

   2. Consider your evil tendencies, and how far you have followed them.
   These two points will show you that your sins are more in number than
   the hairs of your head, or the sand on the seashore.

   3. Apart from sin, consider your ingratitude towards God, which is in
   itself a sin enfolding all the others, and adding to their enormity:
   consider the gifts which God has given you, and which you have turned
   against the Giver; especially the inspirations you have neglected, and
   the promptings to good which you have frustrated. Review the many
   Sacraments you have received, and see where are their fruits. Where are
   the precious jewels wherewith your Heavenly Bridegroom decked you? with
   what preparation have you received them? Reflect upon the ingratitude
   with which, while God sought to save you, you have fled from Him and
   rushed upon destruction.

   Affections and Resolutions.

   1. Humble yourself in your wretchedness. O my God, how dare I come
   before Thine Eyes? I am but a corrupt being, a very sink of ingratitude
   and wickedness. Can it be that I have been so disloyal, that not one
   sense, not one faculty but has been sullied and stained;--not one day
   has passed but I have sinned before Thee? Was this a fitting return for
   all my Creator's gifts, for my Redeemer's Blood?

   2. Ask pardon;--throw yourself at the Lord's Feet as the prodigal son,
   as the Magdalene, as the woman convicted of adultery. Have mercy, Lord,
   on me a sinner! O Living Fountain of Mercy, have pity on me, unworthy
   as I am.

   3. Resolve to do better. Lord, with the help of Thy Grace I will never
   again give myself up to sin. I have loved it too well;--henceforth I
   would abhor it and cleave to Thee. Father of Mercy, I would live and
   die to Thee.

   4. In order to put away past sin, accuse yourself bravely of it, let
   there not be one sinful act which you do not bring to light.

   5. Resolve to make every effort to tear up the roots of sin from your
   heart, especially this and that individual sin which troubles you most.

   6. In order to do this, resolve stedfastly to follow the advice given
   you, and never think that you have done enough to atone for your past
   sin.

   Conclusion.

   1. Thank God for having waited till now for you, and for rousing these
   good intentions in your heart. 2. Offer Him all your heart to carry
   them to good effect. 3. Pray that He would strengthen you.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XIII. FIFTH MEDITATION.

   Of Death.

   Preparation.

   1. PLACE yourself in the Presence of God. 2. Ask His Grace. 3. Suppose
   yourself to be on your deathbed, in the last extremity, without the
   smallest hope of recovery.

   Considerations.

   1. Consider the uncertainty as to the day of your death. One day your
   soul will quit this body--will it be in summer or winter? in town or
   country? by day or by night? will it be suddenly or with warning? will
   it be owing to sickness or an accident? will you have time to make your
   last confession or not? will your confessor or spiritual father be at
   hand or will he not? Alas, of all these things we know absolutely
   nothing: all that we do know is that die we shall, and for the most
   part sooner than we expect.

   2. Consider that then the world is at end as far as you are concerned,
   there will be no more of it for you, it will be altogether overthrown
   for you, since all pleasures, vanities, worldly joys, empty delights
   will be as a mere fantastic vision to you. Woe is me, for what mere
   trifles and unrealities I have ventured to offend my God? Then you will
   see that what we preferred to Him was nought. But, on the other hand,
   all devotion and good works will then seem so precious and so
   sweet:--Why did I not tread that pleasant path? Then what you thought
   to be little sins will look like huge mountains, and your devotion will
   seem but a very little thing.

   3. Consider the universal farewell which your soul will take of this
   world. It will say farewell to riches, pleasures, and idle companions;
   to amusements and pastimes, to friends and neighbours, to husband, wife
   and child, in short to all creation. And lastly it will say farewell to
   its own body, which it will leave pale and cold, to become repulsive in
   decay.

   4. Consider how the survivors will hasten to put that body away, and
   hide it beneath the earth--and then the world will scarce give you
   another thought, or remember you, any more than you have done to those
   already gone. "God rest his soul!" men will say, and that is all. O
   death, how pitiless, how hard thou art!

   5. Consider that when it quits the body the soul must go at once to the
   right hand or the left. To which will your soul go? what side will it
   take? none other, be sure, than that to which it had voluntarily drawn
   while yet in this world.

   Affections and Resolutions.

   1. Pray to God, and throw yourself into His Arms. O Lord, be Thou my
   stay in that day of anguish! May that hour be blessed and favourable to
   me, if all the rest of my life be full of sadness and trial.

   2. Despise the world. Forasmuch as I know not the hour in which I must
   quit the world, I will not grow fond of it. O dear friends, beloved
   ones of my heart, be content that I cleave to you only with a holy
   friendship which may last for ever; why should I cling to you with a
   tie which must needs be broken?

   I will prepare for the hour of death and take every precaution for its
   peaceful arrival; I will thoroughly examine into the state of my
   conscience, and put in order whatever is wanting.

   Conclusion.

   Thank God for inspiring you with these resolutions: offer them to His
   Majesty: intreat Him anew to grant you a happy death by the Merits of
   His Dear Son's Death. Ask the prayers of the Blessed Virgin and the
   Saints. OUR FATHER, etc.

   Gather a bouquet of myrrh.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XIV. SIXTH MEDITATION.

   On Judgment.

   Preparation.

   1. PLACE yourself in the Presence of God. 2. Intreat Him to inspire
   you.

   Considerations.

   1. When the time comes which God has appointed for the end of this
   world, and after many terrible signs and warnings, which will overwhelm
   men with fear,--the whole earth will be destroyed, and nothing then
   left.

   2. Afterwards, all men, save those already risen, shall rise from the
   dead, and at the voice of the Archangel appear in the valley of
   Jehoshaphat. But alas, with what divers aspects! for some will be
   glorious and shining, others horrible and ghastly.

   3. Consider the majesty with which the Sovereign Judge will appear
   surrounded by all His Saints and Angels; His Cross, the Sign of Grace
   to the good and of terror to the evil, shining brighter than the sun.

   4. This Sovereign Judge will with His awful word, instantly fulfilled,
   separate the evil and the good, setting the one on His Right Hand, the
   other on His Left--an eternal separation, for they will never meet
   again.

   5. This separation made, the books of conscience will be opened, and
   all men will behold the malice of the wicked, and how they have
   contemned God; as also the penitence of the good, and the results of
   the grace they received. Nothing will be hid. O my God, what confusion
   to the one, what rejoicing to the other! Consider the final sentence of
   the wicked. "Depart from Me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared
   for the devil and his angels." Dwell upon these awful words. "Go," He
   says--for ever discarding these wretched sinners, banishing them for
   ever from His Presence. He calls them "cursed:" O my soul, what a
   curse: a curse involving all other maledictions, all possible evil, an
   irrevocable curse, including all time and eternity; condemning them to
   everlasting fire. Think what that eternity of suffering implies.

   6. Then consider the sentence of the good. "Come," the Judge says--O
   blessed loving word with which God draws us to Himself and receives us
   in His Bosom. "Blessed of My Father"--O blessing above all blessings!
   "inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world."
   O my God, and that Kingdom will know no end!

   Affections and Resolutions.

   1. Tremble, my soul, at the thought. O God, who will be my stay in that
   hour when the pillars of the earth are shaken?

   2. Abhor your sins, which alone can cause you to be lost when that
   fearful day comes. Surely I will judge myself now, that I be not
   judged;--I will examine my conscience, accuse, condemn, punish myself,
   that the Judge may not condemn me then. I will confess my faults, and
   follow the counsels given me.

   Conclusion.

   Thank God for having given you means of safety in that terrible Day,
   and time for repentance. Offer Him your heart, and ask for grace to use
   it well. OUR FATHER, etc.

   Gather your bouquet.

CHAPTER XV. SEVENTH MEDITATION.

   Of Hell.

   Preparation.

   1. PLACE yourself in God's Presence.2. Humble yourself, and ask His
   Aid.3. Picture to yourself a dark city, reeking with the flames of
   sulphur and brimstone, inhabited by citizens who cannot get forth.

   Considerations.

   1. Even so the lost are plunged in their infernal abyss;--suffering
   indescribable torture in every sense and every member; and that because
   having used their members and senses for sin, it is just that through
   them they should suffer now. Those eyes which delighted in impure
   vicious sights, now behold devils; the ears which took pleasure in
   unholy words, now are deafened with yells of despair;--and so on with
   the other senses. 2. Beyond all these sufferings, there is one greater
   still, the privation and pain of loss of God's Glory, which is for ever
   denied to their vision. If Absalom cared not to be released from exile,
   if he might not see his father's face, [19] how much sorer will it be
   to be deprived for ever of the blessed vision of God?

   3. Consider how insupportable the pains of Hell will be by reason of
   their eternal duration. If the irritating bite of an insect, or the
   restlessness of fever, makes an ordinary night seem so long and
   tedious, how terrible will the endless night of eternity be, where
   nought will be found save despair, blasphemy and fury!

   Affections and Resolutions.

   1. Read the Prophet's descriptions of the terrors of the Lord, [20] and
   ask your soul whether it can face them--whether you can bear to lose
   your God for ever?

   2. Confess that you have repeatedly deserved to do so. Resolve
   henceforth to act differently, and to rescue yourself from this abyss.
   Resolve on distinct definite acts by which you may avoid sin, and
   thereby eternal death.

   Give thanks, offer yourself, pray.

CHAPTER XVI. EIGHTH MEDITATION.

   On Paradise.

   Preparation.

   1. PLACE yourself in the Presence of God.2. Invoke His Aid.

   Considerations.

   1. Represent to yourself a lovely calm night, when the heavens are
   bright with innumerable stars: add to the beauty of such a night the
   utmost beauty of a glorious summer's day,--the sun's brightness not
   hindering the clear shining of moon or stars, and then be sure that it
   all falls immeasurably short of the glory of Paradise. O bright and
   blessed country, O sweet and precious place!

   2. Consider the beauty and perfection of the countless inhabitants of
   that blessed country;--the millions and millions of angels, Cherubim
   and Seraphim; the glorious company of Apostles, martyrs, confessors,
   virgins, and saints. O blessed company, any one single member of which
   surpasses all the glory of this world, what will it be to behold them
   all, to sing with them the sweet Song of the Lamb? They rejoice with a
   perpetual joy, they share a bliss unspeakable, and unchangeable
   delights.

   3. Consider how they enjoy the Presence of God, Who fills them with the
   richness of His Vision, which is a perfect ocean of delight; the joy of
   being for ever united to their Head. They are like happy birds,
   hovering and singing for ever within the atmosphere of divinity, which
   fills them with inconceivable pleasures. There each one vies without
   jealousy in singing the praises of the Creator. "Blessed art Thou for
   ever, O Dear and Precious Lord and Redeemer, Who dost so freely give us
   of Thine Own Glory," they cry; and He in His turn pours out His
   ceaseless Blessing on His Saints. "Blessed are ye,--Mine own for ever,
   who have served Me faithfully, and with a good courage."

   Affections and Resolutions.

   1. Admire and rejoice in the Heavenly Country; the glorious and blessed
   New Jerusalem.

   2. Reprove the coldness of your own heart for having hitherto so little
   sought after that glorious abode. Why have I so long lingered
   indifferent to the eternal happiness set before me? Woe is me that, for
   the sake of poor savourless earthly things, I have so often forgotten
   those heavenly delights. How could I neglect such real treasures for
   mere vain and contemptible earthly matters?

   3. Aspire earnestly after that blessed abode. Forasmuch, O Dear Lord,
   as Thou hast been pleased to turn my feet into Thy ways, never will I
   again look back. Go forth, my soul, towards thy promised rest, journey
   unweariedly to that hoped-for land; wherefore shouldest thou tarry in
   Egypt?

   4. Resolve to give up such and such things, which hinder you on the
   way, and to do such others as will help you thitherwards.

   Give thanks, offer, pray.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XVII. NINTH MEDITATION.

   On the Choice upon to you between Heaven and Hell.

   Preparation.

   1. PLACE yourself in the Presence of God.2. Humble yourself before Him,
   and ask His inspiration.

   Considerations.

   1. Imagine yourself alone with your good angel in an open plain, as was
   Tobit on his way to Rages. Suppose the Angel to set before you
   Paradise, full of delights and joys; and on the other hand Hell, with
   all its torments. Contemplate both, kneeling in imagination before your
   guardian Angel. Consider that you are most truly standing between Hell
   and Paradise, and that both the one and the other are open to receive
   you, according to your own choice.

   2. Consider that the choice you make in this life will last for ever in
   the next.

   3. Consider too, that while both are open to receive you according to
   your choice, yet God, Who is prepared to give the one by reason of His
   Justice, the other by reason of His Mercy, all the while desires
   unspeakably that you should select Paradise; and your good Angel is
   urging you with all his might to do so, offering you countless graces
   on God's part, countless helps to attain to it.

   4. Consider that Jesus Christ, enthroned in Heaven, looks down upon you
   in loving invitation: "O beloved one, come unto Me, and joy for ever in
   the eternal blessedness of My Love!" Behold His mother yearning over
   you with maternal tenderness--" Courage, my child, do not despise the
   Goodness of my Son, or my earnest prayers for thy salvation." Behold
   the Saints, who have left you their example, the millions of holy souls
   who long after you, desiring earnestly that you may one day be for ever
   joined to them in their song of praise, urging upon you that the road
   to Heaven is not so hard to find as the world would have you think.
   "Press on boldly, dear friend,"--they cry. "Whoso will ponder well the
   path by which we came hither, will discover that we attained to these
   present delights by sweeter joys than any this world can give."

   The Choice.

   1. O Hell, I abhor thee now and for ever; I abhor thy griefs and
   torments, thine endless misery, the unceasing blasphemies and
   maledictions which thou pourest out upon my God;--and turning to thee,
   O blessed Paradise, eternal glory, unfading happiness, I choose thee
   for ever as my abode, thy glorious mansions, thy precious and abiding
   tabernacles. O my God, I bless Thy Mercy which gives me the power to
   choose--O Jesus, Saviour, I accept Thine Eternal Love, and praise Thee
   for the promise Thou hast given me of a place prepared for me in that
   blessed New Jerusalem, where I shall love and bless Thee for ever.

   2. Dwell lovingly upon the example set before you by the Blessed Virgin
   and the Saints, and strive to follow where they point you. Give
   yourself up to your guardian Angel, that he may be your guide, and gird
   up your courage anew to make this choice.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XVIII. TENTH MEDITATION.

   How the Soul chooses the Devout Life.

   Preparation.

   1. PLACE yourself in the Presence of God.2. Humble yourself before Him,
   and ask His Aid.

   Considerations.

   1. Once more imagine yourself in an open plain, alone with your
   guardian Angel, and represent to yourself on the left hand the Devil
   sitting on a high and mighty throne, surrounded by a vast troop of
   worldly men, who bow bareheaded before him, doing homage to him by the
   various sins they commit. Study the countenances of the miserable
   courtiers of that most abominable king:--some raging with fury, envy
   and passion, some murderous in their hatred;--others pale and haggard
   in their craving after wealth, or madly pursuing every vain and
   profitless pleasure;--others sunk and lost in vile, impure affections.
   See how all alike are hateful, restless, wild: see how they despise one
   another, and only pretend to an unreal self-seeking love. Such is the
   miserable reign of the abhorred Tyrant.

   2. On the other hand, behold Jesus Christ Crucified, calling these
   unhappy wretches to come to Him, and interceding for them with all the
   Love of His Precious Heart. Behold the company of devout souls and
   their guardian Angels, contemplate the beauty of this religious
   Kingdom. What lovelier than the troop of virgin souls, men and women,
   pure as lilies:--widows in their holy desolation and humility; husbands
   and wives living in all tender love and mutual cherishing. See how such
   pious souls know how to combine their exterior and interior duties;--to
   love the earthly spouse without diminishing their devotion to the
   Heavenly Bridegroom. Look around--one and all you will see them with
   loving, holy, gentle countenances listening to the Voice of their Lord,
   all seeking to enthrone Him more and more within their hearts.

   They rejoice, but it is with a peaceful, loving, sober joy; they love,
   but their love is altogether holy and pure. Such among these devout
   ones as have sorrows to bear, are not disheartened thereby, and do not
   grieve overmuch, for their Saviour's Eye is upon them to comfort them,
   and they all seek Him only.

   3. Surely you have altogether renounced Satan with his weary miserable
   troop, by the good resolutions you have made;--but nevertheless you
   have not yet wholly attained to the King Jesus, or altogether joined
   His blessed company of devout ones:--you have hovered betwixt the two.

   4. The Blessed Virgin, S. Joseph, S. Louis, S. Monica, and hundreds of
   thousands more who were once like you, living in the world, call upon
   you and encourage you.

   5. The Crucified King Himself calls you by your own name: "Come, O my
   beloved, come, and let Me crown thee!"

   The Choice.

   1. O world, O vile company, never will I enlist beneath thy banner; for
   ever I have forsaken thy flatteries and deceptions. O proud king,
   monarch of evil, infernal spirit, I renounce thee and all thy hollow
   pomp, I detest thee and all thy works.

   2. And turning to Thee, O Sweet Jesus, King of blessedness and of
   eternal glory, I cleave to Thee with all the powers of my soul, I adore
   Thee with all my heart, I choose Thee now and ever for my King, and
   with inviolable fidelity I would offer my irrevocable service, and
   submit myself to Thy holy laws and ordinances.

   3. O Blessed Virgin Mother of God, you shall be my example, I will
   follow you with all reverence and respect.

   O my good Angel, bring me to this heavenly company, leave me not until
   I have reached them, with whom I will sing for ever, in testimony of my
   choice, "Glory be to Jesus, my Lord!"
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XIX. How to make a General Confession.

   SUCH meditations as these, my daughter, will help you, and having made
   them, go on bravely in the spirit of humility to make your general
   confession;--but I entreat you, be not troubled by any sort of
   fearfulness. The scorpion who stings us is venomous, but when his oil
   has been distilled, it is the best remedy for his bite;--even so sin is
   shameful when we commit it, but when reduced to repentance and
   confession, it becomes salutary and honourable. Contrition and
   confession are in themselves so lovely and sweet-savoured, that they
   efface the ugliness and disperse the ill savour of sin. Simon the leper
   called Magdalene a sinner, [21] but our Lord turned the discourse to
   the perfume of her ointment and the greatness of her love. If we are
   really humble, my daughter, our sins will be infinitely displeasing to
   us, because they offend God;--but it will be welcome and sweet to
   accuse ourselves thereof because in so doing we honour God; and there
   is always somewhat soothing in fully telling the physician all details
   of our pain.

   When you come to your spiritual father, imagine yourself to be on Mount
   Calvary, at the Feet of the Crucified Saviour, Whose Precious Blood is
   dropping freely to cleanse you from all your sin. Though it is not his
   actual Blood, yet it is the merit of that outpoured Blood which is
   sprinkled over His penitents as they kneel in Confession. Be sure then
   that you open your heart fully, and put away your sins by confessing
   them, for in proportion as they are put out, so will the Precious
   Merits of the Passion of Christ come in and fill you with blessings.

   Tell everything simply and with straightforwardness, and thoroughly
   satisfy your conscience in doing so. Then listen to the admonitions and
   counsels of God's Minister, saying in your heart, "Speak, Lord, for Thy
   servant heareth." It is truly God to Whom you hearken, forasmuch as He
   has said to His representatives, "Whoso heareth you, heareth Me." [22]
   Then take the following protest, as a summary of your contrition,
   having carefully studied and meditated upon it beforehand: read it
   through with as earnest an intention as you can make.

CHAPTER XX. A hearty Protest made with the object of confirming the Soul's
resolution to serve God, as a conclusion to its acts of Penitence.

   I, THE undersigned,--in the Presence of God and of all the company of
   Heaven, having considered the Infinite Mercy of His Heavenly Goodness
   towards me, a most miserable, unworthy creature, whom He has created,
   preserved, sustained, delivered from so many dangers, and filled with
   so many blessings: having above all considered the incomprehensible
   mercy and loving-kindness with which this most Good God has borne with
   me in my sinfulness, leading me so tenderly to repentance, and waiting
   so patiently for me till this--(present) year of my life,
   notwithstanding all my ingratitude, disloyalty and faithlessness, by
   which I have delayed turning to Him, and despising His Grace, have
   offended Him anew: and further, remembering that in my Baptism I was
   solemnly and happily dedicated to God as His child, and that in
   defiance of the profession then made in my name, I have so often
   miserably profaned my gifts, turning them against God's Divine
   Majesty:--I, now coming to myself prostrate in heart and soul before
   the Throne of His Justice, acknowledge and confess that I am duly
   accused and convicted of treason against His Majesty, and guilty of the
   Death and Passion of Jesus Christ, by reason of the sins I have
   committed, for which He died, bearing the reproach of the Cross; so
   that I deserve nothing else save eternal damnation.

   But turning to the Throne of Infinite Mercy of this Eternal God,
   detesting the sins of my past life with all my heart and all my
   strength, I humbly desire and ask grace, pardon, and mercy, with entire
   absolution from my sin, in virtue of the Death and Passion of that same
   Lord and Redeemer, on Whom I lean as the only ground of my hope. I
   renew the sacred promise of faithfulness to God made in my name at my
   Baptism; renouncing the devil, the world, and the flesh, abhorring
   their accursed suggestions, vanities and lusts, now and for all
   eternity. And turning to a Loving and Pitiful God, I desire, intend,
   and deliberately resolve to serve and love Him now and eternally,
   devoting my mind and all its faculties, my soul and all its powers, my
   heart and all its affections, my body and all its senses, to His Will.
   I resolve never to misuse any part of my being by opposing His Divine
   Will and Sovereign Majesty, to which I wholly immolate myself in
   intention, vowing ever to be His loyal, obedient and faithful servant
   without any change or recall. But if unhappily, through the promptings
   of the enemy, or human infirmity, I should in anywise fail in this my
   resolution and dedication, I do most earnestly resolve by the grace of
   the Holy Spirit to rise up again so soon as I shall perceive my fall,
   and turn anew, without any delay, to seek His Divine Mercy. This is my
   firm will and intention,--my inviolable, irrevocable resolution, which
   I make and confirm without any reserve, in the Holy Presence of God, in
   the sight of the Church triumphant, and before the Church militant,
   which is my mother, who accepts this my declaration, in the person of
   him who, as her representative, hears me make it. Be pleased, O
   Eternal, All-Powerful, and All-Loving God,--Father, Son, and Holy
   Spirit, to confirm me in this my resolution, and accept my hearty and
   willing offering. And inasmuch as Thou hast been pleased to inspire me
   with the will to make it, give me also the needful strength and grace
   to keep it. O God, Thou art my God, the God of my heart, my soul, and
   spirit, and as such I acknowledge and adore Thee, now and for all
   eternity. Glory be to Jesus. Amen.

CHAPTER XXI. Conclusion of this First Purification.

   HAVING made this resolution, wait attentively, and open the ears of
   your heart, that you may in spirit hear the absolution which the Lord
   of your soul, sitting on the throne of His Mercy, will speak in Heaven
   before the Saints and Angels when His Priest absolves you here below in
   His Name. Be sure that all that company of blessed ones rejoice in your
   joy, and sing a song of untold gladness, embracing you and accepting
   you as cleansed and sanctified. Of a truth, my daughter, this is a
   marvellous deed, and a most blessed bargain for you, inasmuch as giving
   yourself to His Divine Majesty, you gain Him, and save yourself for
   eternal life. No more remains to do, save to take the pen and heartily
   sign your protest, and then hasten to the Altar, where God on His side
   will sign and seal your absolution, and His promise of Paradise, giving
   Himself to you in His Sacrament, as a sacred seal placed upon your
   renewed heart. And thus, dear child, your soul will be cleansed from
   sin, and from all its affections. But forasmuch as these affections are
   easily rekindled, thanks to our infirmity and concupiscence (which
   maybe mortified, but which can never be altogether extinguished while
   we live), I will give you certain counsels by the practice of which you
   may henceforth avoid mortal sin, and the affections pertaining thereto.
   And as these counsels will also help you to attain a yet more perfect
   purification, before giving them, I would say somewhat concerning that
   absolute perfection to which I seek to lead you.

CHAPTER XXII. The Necessity of Purging away all tendency to Venial Sins.

   AS daylight waxes, we, gazing into a mirror, see more plainly the soils
   and stains upon our face; and even so as the interior light of the Holy
   Spirit enlightens our conscience, we see more distinctly the sins,
   inclinations and imperfections which hinder our progress towards real
   devotion. And the selfsame light which shows us these blots and stains,
   kindles in us the desire to be cleansed and purged therefrom. You will
   find then, my child, that besides the mortal sins and their affections
   from which your soul has already been purged, you are beset by sundry
   inclinations and tendencies to venial sin; mind, I do not say you will
   find venial sins, but the inclination and tendency to them. Now, one is
   quite different from the other. We can never be altogether free from
   venial sin,--at least not until after a very long persistence in this
   purity; but we can be without any affection for venial sin. It is
   altogether one thing to have said something unimportant not strictly
   true, out of carelessness or liveliness, and quite a different matter
   to take pleasure in lying, and in the habitual practice thereof. But I
   tell you that you must purify your soul from all inclination to venial
   sin;--that is to say, you must not voluntarily retain any deliberate
   intention of permitting yourself to commit any venial sin whatever. It
   would be most unworthy consciously to admit anything so displeasing to
   God, as the will to offend Him in anywise. Venial sin, however small,
   is displeasing to God, although it be not so displeasing as the greater
   sins which involve eternal condemnation; and if venial sin is
   displeasing to Him, any clinging which we tolerate to mortal sin is
   nothing less than a resolution to offend His Divine Majesty. Is it
   really possible that a rightly disposed soul can not only offend God,
   but take pleasure therein?

   These inclinations, my daughter, are in direct opposition to devotion,
   as inclinations to mortal sin are to love:--they weaken the mental
   power, hinder Divine consolations, and open the door to
   temptations;--and although they may not destroy the soul, at least they
   bring on very serious disease. "Dead flies cause the ointment to send
   forth a stinking savour," says the Wise Man. [23] He means that the
   flies which settle upon and taste of the ointment only damage it
   temporarily, leaving the mass intact, but if they fall into it, and die
   there, they spoil and corrupt it. Even so venial sins which pass over a
   devout soul without being harboured, do not permanently injure it, but
   if such sins are fostered and cherished, they destroy the sweet savour
   of that soul--that is to say, its devotion. The spider cannot kill
   bees, but it can spoil their honey, and so encumber their combs with
   its webs in course of time, as to hinder the bees materially. Just so,
   though venial sins may not lose the soul, they will spoil its devotion,
   and so cumber its faculties with bad habits and evil inclinations, as
   to deprive it of all that cheerful readiness which is the very essence
   of true devotion; that is to say, if they are harboured in the
   conscience by delight taken therein. A trifling inaccuracy, a little
   hastiness in word or action, some small excess in mirth, in dress, in
   gaiety, may not be very important, if these are forthwith heeded and
   swept out as spiritual cobwebs;--but if they are permitted to linger in
   the heart, or, worse still, if we take pleasure in them and indulge
   them, our honey will soon be spoilt, and the hive of our conscience
   will be cumbered and damaged. But I ask again, how can a generous heart
   take delight in anything it knows to be displeasing to its God, or wish
   to do what offends Him?

CHAPTER XXIII. It is needful to put away all Inclination for Useless and
Dangerous Things.

   SPORTS, balls, plays, festivities, pomps, are not in themselves evil,
   but rather indifferent matters, capable of being used for good or ill;
   but nevertheless they are dangerous, and it is still more dangerous to
   take great delight in them. Therefore, my daughter, I say that although
   it is lawful to amuse yourself, to dance, dress, feast, and see seemly
   plays,--at the same time, if you are much addicted to these things,
   they will hinder your devotion, and become extremely hurtful and
   dangerous to you. The harm lies, not in doing them, but in the degree
   to which you care for them. It is a pity to sow the seed of vain and
   foolish tastes in the soil of your heart, taking up the place of better
   things, and hindering the soul from cultivating good dispositions. It
   was thus that the Nazarites of old abstained not merely from all
   intoxicating liquors, but from grapes fresh or dried, and from vinegar,
   not because these were intoxicating, but because they might excite the
   desire for fermented liquors. Just so, while I do not forbid the use of
   these dangerous pleasures, I say that you cannot take an excessive
   delight in them without their telling upon your devotion. When the stag
   has waxed fat he hides himself amid the thicket, conscious that his
   fleetness is impaired should he be in need to fly: and so the human
   heart which is cumbered with useless, superfluous, dangerous clingings
   becomes incapacitated for that earnest following after God which is the
   true life of devotion. No one blames children for running after
   butterflies, because they are children, but is it not ridiculous and
   pitiful to see full-grown men eager about such worthless trifles as the
   worldly amusements before named, which are likely to throw them off
   their balance and disturb their spiritual life? Therefore, dear child,
   I would have you cleanse your heart from all such tastes, remembering
   that while the acts themselves are not necessarily incompatible with a
   devout life, all delight in them must be harmful.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXIV. All Evil Inclinations must be purged away.

   FURTHERMORE, my daughter, we have certain natural inclinations, which
   are not strictly speaking either mortal or venial sins, but rather
   imperfections; and the acts in which they take shape, failings and
   deficiencies. Thus S. Jerome says that S. Paula had so strong a
   tendency to excessive sorrow, that when she lost her husband and
   children she nearly died of grief: that was not a sin, but an
   imperfection, since it did not depend upon her wish and will. Some
   people are naturally easy, some oppositions; some are indisposed to
   accept other men's opinions, some naturally disposed to be cross, some
   to be affectionate--in short, there is hardly any one in whom some such
   imperfections do not exist. Now, although they be natural and
   instinctive in each person, they may be remedied and corrected, or even
   eradicated, by cultivating the reverse disposition. And this, my child,
   must be done. Gardeners have found how to make the bitter almond tree
   bear sweet fruit, by grafting the juice of the latter upon it, why
   should we not purge out our perverse dispositions and infuse such as
   are good? There is no disposition so good but it may be made bad by
   dint of vicious habits, and neither is there any natural disposition so
   perverse but that it may be conquered and overcome by God's Grace
   primarily, and then by our earnest diligent endeavour. I shall
   therefore now proceed to give you counsels and suggest practices by
   which you may purify your soul from all dangerous affections and
   imperfections, and from all tendencies to venial sin, thereby
   strengthening yourself more and more against mortal sin. May God give
   you grace to use them.

 PART II. CONTAINING SUNDRY COUNSELS AS TO UPLIFTING THE SOUL TO GOD IN PRAYER
                         AND THE USE OF THE SACRAMENTS.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER I. The Necessity of Prayer.

   1. PRAYER opens the understanding to the brightness of Divine Light,
   and the will to the warmth of Heavenly Love--nothing can so effectually
   purify the mind from its many ignorances, or the will from its perverse
   affections. It is as a healing water which causes the roots of our good
   desires to send forth fresh shoots, which washes away the soul's
   imperfections, and allays the thirst of passion.

   2. But especially I commend earnest mental prayer to you, more
   particularly such as bears upon the Life and Passion of our Lord. If
   you contemplate Him frequently in meditation, your whole soul will be
   filled with Him, you will grow in His Likeness, and your actions will
   be moulded on His. He is the Light of the world; therefore in Him, by
   Him, and for Him we shall be enlightened and illuminated; He is the
   Tree of Life, beneath the shadow of which we must find rest;--He is the
   Living Fountain of Jacob's well, wherein we may wash away every stain.
   Children learn to speak by hearing their mother talk, and stammering
   forth their childish sounds in imitation; and so if we cleave to the
   Savior in meditation, listening to His words, watching His actions and
   intentions, we shall learn in time, through His Grace, to speak, act
   and will like Himself. Believe me, my daughter, there is no way to God
   save through this door. Just as the glass of a mirror would give no
   reflection save for the metal behind it, so neither could we here below
   contemplate the Godhead, were it not united to the Sacred Humanity of
   our Saviour, Whose Life and Death are the best, sweetest and most
   profitable subjects that we can possibly select for meditation. It is
   not without meaning that the Saviour calls Himself the Bread come down
   from Heaven;--just as we eat bread with all manner of other food, so we
   need to meditate and feed upon our Dear Lord in every prayer and
   action. His Life has been meditated and written about by various
   authors. I should specially commend to you the writings of S.
   Bonaventura, Bellintani, Bruno, Capilla, Grenada and Da Ponte. [24]

   3. Give an hour every day to meditation before dinner;--if you can, let
   it be early in the morning, when your mind will be less cumbered, and
   fresh after the night's rest. Do not spend more than an hour thus,
   unless specially advised to do so by your spiritual father.

   4. If you can make your meditation quietly in church, it will be well,
   and no one, father or mother, husband or wife, can object to an hour
   spent there, and very probably you could not secure a time so free from
   interruption at home.

   5. Begin all prayer, whether mental or vocal, by an act of the Presence
   of God. If you observe this rule strictly, you will soon see how useful
   it is.

   6. It may help you to say the Creed, Lord's Prayer, etc., in Latin, but
   you should also study them diligently in your own language, so as
   thoroughly to gather up the meaning of these holy words, which must be
   used fixing your thoughts steadily on their purport, not striving to
   say many words so much as seeking to say a few with your whole heart.
   One Our Father said devoutly is worth more than many prayers hurried
   over.

   7. The Rosary is a useful devotion when rightly used, and there are
   various little books to teach this. It is well, too, to say pious
   Litanies, and the other vocal prayers appointed for the Hours and found
   in Manuals of devotion,--but if you have a gift for mental prayer, let
   that always take the chief place, so that if, having made that, you are
   hindered by business or any other cause from saying your wonted vocal
   prayers, do not be disturbed, but rest satisfied with saying the Lord's
   Prayer, the Angelic Salutation, and the Creed after your meditation.

   8. If, while saying vocal prayers, your heart feels drawn to mental
   prayer, do not resist it, but calmly let your mind fall into that
   channel, without troubling because you have not finished your appointed
   vocal prayers. The mental prayer you have substituted for them is more
   acceptable to God, and more profitable to your soul. I should make an
   exception of the Church's Offices, if you are bound to say those by
   your vocation--in such a case these are your duty.

   9. If it should happen that your morning goes by without the usual
   meditation, either owing to a pressure of business, or from any other
   cause, (which interruptions you should try to prevent as far as
   possible,) try to repair the loss in the afternoon, but not immediately
   after a meal, or you will perhaps be drowsy, which is bad both for your
   meditation and your health. But if you are unable all day to make up
   for the omission, you must remedy it as far as may be by ejaculatory
   prayer, and by reading some spiritual book, together with an act of
   penitence for the neglect, together with a stedfast resolution to do
   better the next day.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [24] S. Bonaventura, Louis of Grenada, and Da Ponte's works are still
   available and are admirable helps to meditation. Among more modern
   works might be suggested Isaac Williams on the Passion, Avrillon's Lent
   Guide, &c. &c.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER II. A short Method of Meditation. And first, the Presence of God, the
First Point of Preparation.

   IT may be, my daughter, that you do not know how to practise mental
   prayer, for unfortunately it is a thing much neglected now-adays. I
   will therefore give you a short and easy method for using it, until
   such time as you may read sundry books written on the subject, and
   above all till practice teaches you how to use it more perfectly. And
   first of all, the Preparation, which consists of two points: first,
   placing yourself in the Presence of God; and second, asking His Aid.
   And in order to place your self in the Presence of God, I will suggest
   four chief considerations which you can use at first.

   First, a lively earnest realisation that His Presence is universal;
   that is to say, that He is everywhere, and in all, and that there is no
   place, nothing in the world, devoid of His Most Holy Presence, so that,
   even as birds on the wing meet the air continually, we, let us go where
   we will, meet with that Presence always and everywhere. It is a truth
   which all are ready to grant, but all are not equally alive to its
   importance. A blind man when in the presence of his prince will
   preserve a reverential demeanour if told that the king is there,
   although unable to see him; but practically, what men do not see they
   easily forget, and so readily lapse into carelessness and irreverence.
   Just so, my child, we do not see our God, and although faith warns us
   that He is present, not beholding Him with our mortal eyes, we are too
   apt to forget Him, and act as though He were afar: for, while knowing
   perfectly that He is everywhere, if we do not think about it, it is
   much as though we knew it not. And therefore, before beginning to pray,
   it is needful always to rouse the soul to a stedfast remembrance and
   thought of the Presence of God. This is what David meant when he
   exclaimed, "If I climb up to Heaven, Thou art there, and if I go down
   to hell, Thou art there also!" [25] And in like manner Jacob, who,
   beholding the ladder which went up to Heaven, cried out, "Surely the
   Lord is in this place and I knew it not" [26] meaning thereby that he
   had not thought of it; for assuredly he could not fail to know that God
   was everywhere and in all things. Therefore, when you make ready to
   pray, you must say with your whole heart, "God is indeed here."

   The second way of placing yourself in this Sacred Presence is to call
   to mind that God is not only present in the place where you are, but
   that He is very specially present in your heart and mind, which He
   kindles and inspires with His Holy Presence, abiding there as Heart of
   your heart, Spirit of your spirit. Just as the soul animates the whole
   body, and every member thereof, but abides especially in the heart, so
   God, while present everywhere, yet makes His special abode with our
   spirit. Therefore David calls Him "the Strength of my heart;" [27] and
   S. Paul said that in Him "we live and move and have our being." [28]
   Dwell upon this thought until you have kindled a great reverence within
   your heart for God Who is so closely present to you.

   The third way is to dwell upon the thought of our Lord, Who in His
   Ascended Humanity looks down upon all men, but most particularly on all
   Christians, because they are His children; above all, on those who
   pray, over whose doings He keeps watch. Nor is this any mere
   imagination, it is very truth, and although we see Him not, He is
   looking down upon us. It was given to S. Stephen in the hour of
   martyrdom thus to behold Him, and we may well say with the Bride of the
   Canticles, "He looketh forth at the windows, shewing Himself through
   the lattice." [29]

   The fourth way is simply to exercise your ordinary imagination,
   picturing the Saviour to yourself in His Sacred Humanity as if He were
   beside you just as we are wont to think of our friends, and fancy that
   we see or hear them at our side. But when the Blessed Sacrament of the
   Altar is there, then this Presence is no longer imaginary, but most
   real; and the sacred species are but as a veil from behind which the
   Present Saviour beholds and considers us, although we cannot see Him as
   He is.

   Make use of one or other of these methods for placing yourself in the
   Presence of God before you begin to pray;--do not try to use them all
   at once, but take one at a time, and that briefly and simply.

     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER III. Invocation, the Second Point of Preparation.

   INVOCATION is made as follows: your soul, having realised God's
   Presence, will prostrate itself with the utmost reverence,
   acknowledging its unworthiness to abide before His Sovereign Majesty;
   and yet knowing that He of His Goodness would have you come to Him, you
   must ask of Him grace to serve and worship Him in this your meditation.
   You may use some such brief and earnest words as those of David: "Cast
   me not away from Thy Presence, and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me."
   [30] "Shew me Thy Ways, O Lord, and teach me Thy paths." [31] "Give me
   understanding, and I shall keep Thy Law: yea, I shall keep it with my
   whole heart." [32] "I am Thy servant, O grant me understanding." [33]
   Dwell too upon the thought of your guardian Angel, and of the Saints
   connected with the special mystery you are considering, as the Blessed
   Virgin, S. John, the Magdalene, the good thief, etc., if you are
   meditating in the Passion, so that you may share in their devout
   feelings and intention,--and in the same way with other subjects.

     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER IV. The Third Point of Preparation, representing the Mystery to be
meditated to Your Imagination.

   FOLLOWING upon these two ordinary points, there ere is a third, which
   is not necessary to all meditation, called by some the local
   representation, and by others the interior picture. It is simply
   kindling a vivid picture of the mystery to be meditated within your
   imagination, even as though you were actually beholding it. For
   instance, if you wish to meditate upon our Lord on His Cross, you will
   place yourself in imagination on Mount Calvary, as though you saw and
   heard all that occurred there during the Passion; or you can imagine to
   yourself all that the Evangelists describe as taking place where you
   are. In the same way, when you meditate upon death, bring the
   circumstances that will attend your own vividly to mind, and so of
   hell, or any subjects which involve visible, tangible circumstances.
   When it is a question of such mysteries as God's Greatness, His
   Attributes, the end of our creation, or other invisible things, you
   cannot make this use of your imagination. At most you may employ
   certain comparisons and similitudes, but these are not always
   opportune, and I would have you follow a very simple method, and not
   weary your mind with striving after new inventions. Still, often this
   use of the imagination tends to concentrate the mind on the mystery we
   wish to meditate, and to prevent our thoughts from wandering hither and
   thither, just as when you shut a bird within a cage, or fasten a hawk
   by its lures. Some people will tell you that it is better to confine
   yourself to mere abstract thought, and a simple mental and spiritual
   consideration of these mysteries, but this is too difficult for
   beginners; and until God calls you up higher, I would advise you, my
   daughter, to abide contentedly in the lowly valley I have pointed out.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER V. Considerations, the Second Part of Meditation.

   AFTER this exercise of the imagination, we come to that of the
   understanding: for meditations, properly so called, are certain
   considerations by which we raise the affections to God and heavenly
   things. Now meditation differs therein from study and ordinary methods
   of thought which have not the Love of God or growth in holiness for
   their object, but some other end, such as the acquisition of learning
   or power of argument. So, when you have, as I said, limited the efforts
   of your mind within due bounds,--whether by the imagination, if the
   subject be material, or by propositions, if it be a spiritual
   subject,--you will begin to form reflections or considerations after
   the pattern of the meditations I have already sketched for you. And if
   your mind finds sufficient matter, light and fruit wherein to rest in
   any one consideration, dwell upon it, even as the bee, which hovers
   over one flower so long as it affords honey. But if you do not find
   wherewith to feed your mind, after a certain reasonable effort, then go
   on to another consideration,--only be quiet and simple, and do not be
   eager or hurried.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VI. The Third Part of Meditation, Affections and Resolutions.

   MEDITATION excites good desires in the will, or sensitive part of the
   soul,--such as love of God and of our neighbour, a craving for the
   glory of Paradise, zeal for the salvation of others, imitation of our
   Lord's Example, compassion, thanksgiving, fear of God's wrath and of
   judgment, hatred of sin, trust in God's Goodness and Mercy, shame for
   our past life; and in all such affections you should pour out your soul
   as much as possible. If you want help in this, turn to some simple book
   of devotions, the Imitation of Christ, the Spiritual Combat, or
   whatever you find most helpful to your individual wants.

   But, my daughter, you must not stop short in general affections,
   without turning them into special resolutions for your own correction
   and amendment. For instance, meditating on Our Dear Lord's First Word
   from the Cross, you will no doubt be roused to the desire of imitating
   Him in forgiving and loving your enemies. But that is not enough,
   unless you bring it to some practical resolution, such as, "I will not
   be angered any more by the annoying things said of me by such or such a
   neighbour, nor by the slights offered me by such an one; but rather I
   will do such and such things in order to soften and conciliate them."
   In this way, my daughter, you will soon correct your faults, whereas
   mere general resolutions would take but a slow and uncertain effect.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VII. The Conclusion and Spiritual Bouquet.

   THE meditation should be concluded by three acts, made with the utmost
   humility. First, an act of thanksgiving;--thanking God for the
   affections and resolutions with which He has inspired you, and for the
   Mercy and Goodness He has made known to you in the mystery you have
   been meditating. Secondly, an act of oblation, by which you offer your
   affections and resolutions to God, in union with His Own Goodness and
   Mercy, and the Death and Merits of His Son. The third act is one of
   petition, in which you ask God to give you a share in the Merits of His
   Dear Son, and a blessing on your affections and resolutions, to the end
   that you may be able to put them in practice. You will further pray for
   the Church, and all her Ministers, your relations, friends, and all
   others, using the Our Father as the most comprehensive and necessary of
   prayers.

   Besides all this, I bade you gather a little bouquet of devotion, and
   what I mean is this. When walking in a beautiful garden most people are
   wont to gather a few flowers as they go, which they keep, and enjoy
   their scent during the day. So, when the mind explores some mystery in
   meditation, it is well to pick out one or more points that have
   specially arrested the attention, and are most likely to be helpful to
   you through the day, and this should be done at once before quitting
   the subject of your meditation.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VIII. Some Useful Hints as to Meditation.

   ABOVE all things, my daughter, strive when your meditation is ended to
   retain the thoughts and resolutions you have made as your earnest
   practice throughout the day. This is the real fruit of meditation,
   without which it is apt to be unprofitable, if not actually
   harmful--inasmuch as to dwell upon virtues without practising them
   lends to puff us up with unrealities, until we begin to fancy ourselves
   all that we have meditated upon and resolved to be; which is all very
   well if our resolutions are earnest and substantial, but on the
   contrary hollow and dangerous if they are not put in practice. You must
   then diligently endeavour to carry out your resolutions, and seek for
   all opportunities, great or small. For instance, if your resolution was
   to win over those who oppose you by gentleness, seek through the day
   any occasion of meeting such persons kindly, and if none offers, strive
   to speak well of them, and pray for them.

   When you leave off this interior prayer, you must be careful to keep
   your heart in an even balance, lest the balm it has received in
   meditation be scattered. I mean, try to maintain silence for some brief
   space, and let your thoughts be transferred gradually from devotion to
   business, keeping alive the feelings and affections aroused in
   meditation as long as possible. Supposing some one to have received a
   precious porcelain vessel, filled with a most costly liquid, which he
   is going to carry home; how carefully he would go, not looking about,
   but watching stedfastly lest he trip or stumble, or lest he spill any
   of the contents of his vessel. Just so, after meditation, do not allow
   yourself forthwith to be distracted, but look straight before you. Of
   course, if you meet any one to whom you are bound to attend, you must
   act according to the circumstances in which you find yourself, but even
   thus give heed to your heart, so as to lose as little as possible of
   the precious fruits of your meditation. You should strive, too, to
   accustom yourself to go easily from prayer to all such occupations as
   your calling or position lawfully require of you, even although such
   occupations may seem uncongenial to the affections and thoughts just
   before forming part of your prayer. Thus the lawyer should be able to
   go from meditation to his pleading, the tradesman to his business, the
   mistress of a family to the cares of her household and her wifely
   duties, so calmly and gently as not to be in any way disturbed by so
   doing. In both you are fulfilling God's Will, and you should be able to
   turn from one to the other in a devout and humble spirit.

   It may be that sometimes, immediately after your preparation, your
   affections will be wholly drawn to God, and then, my child, you must
   let go the reins, and not attempt to follow any given method; since,
   although as a general rule your considerations should precede your
   affections and resolutions, when the Holy Spirit gives you those
   affections at once, it is unnecessary to use the machinery which was
   intended to bring about the same result. In short, whenever such
   affections are kindled in your heart, accept them, and give them place
   in preference to all other considerations. The only object in placing
   the affections after the points of consideration in meditation, is to
   make the different parts of meditation clearer, for it is a general
   rule that when affections arise they are never to be checked, but
   always encouraged to flow freely. And this applies also to the acts of
   thanksgiving, of oblation and petition, which must not be restrained
   either, although it is well to repeat or renew them at the close of
   your meditation. But your resolutions must be made after the
   affections, and quite at the end of your meditation, and that all the
   more because in these you must enter upon ordinary familiar subjects
   and things which would be liable to cause distractions if they were
   intruded among your spiritual affections.

   Amid your affections and resolutions it is well occasionally to make
   use of colloquies, and to speak sometimes to your Lord, sometimes to
   your guardian Angel, or to those persons who are concerned in the
   mystery you are meditating, to the Saints, to yourself, your own heart,
   to sinners, and even to the inanimate creation around, as David so
   often does in the Psalms, as well as other Saints in their meditations
   and prayers.

CHAPTER IX. Concerning Dryness in Meditation.

   SHOULD it happen sometimes, my daughter, that you have no taste for or
   consolation in your meditation, I entreat you not to be troubled, but
   seek relief in vocal prayer, bemoan yourself to our Lord, confess your
   unworthiness, implore His Aid, kiss His Image, if it be beside you, and
   say in the words of Jacob, "I will not let Thee go, except Thou bless
   me;" or with the Canaanitish woman, "Yes, Lord, I am as a dog before
   Thee, but the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's
   table."

   Or you can take a book, and read attentively till such time as your
   mind is calmed and quickened; or sometimes you may find help from
   external actions, such as prostrating yourself folding your hands upon
   your breast, kissing your Crucifix,--that is, supposing you are alone.
   But if, after all this, you are still unrelieved, do not be disturbed
   at your dryness, however great it be, but continue striving after a
   devout attitude in God's Sight. What numbers of courtiers appear a
   hundred times at court without any hope of a word from their king, but
   merely to pay their homage and be seen of him. Just so, my daughter, we
   ought to enter upon mental prayer purely to fulfil our duty and testify
   our loyalty. If it pleases God's Divine Majesty to speak to us, and
   discourse in our hearts by His Holy Inspirations and inward
   consolations, it is doubtless a great honour, and very sweet to our
   soul; but if He does not vouchsafe such favours, but makes as though He
   saw us not,--as though we were not in His Presence,--nevertheless we
   must not quit it, but on the contrary we must remain calmly and
   devoutly before Him, and He is certain to accept our patient waiting,
   and give heed to our assiduity and perseverance; so that another time
   He will impart to us His consolations, and let us taste all the
   sweetness of holy meditation. But even were it not so, let us, my
   child, be satisfied with the privilege of being in His Presence and
   seen of Him.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER X. Morning Prayer.

   BESIDES your systematic meditation and your other vocal prayers, there
   are five shorter kinds of prayer, which are as aids and assistants to
   the great devotion, and foremost among these is your morning prayer, as
   a general preparation for all the day's work. It should be made in this
   wise.

   1. Thank God, and adore Him for His Grace which has kept you safely
   through the night, and if in anything you have offended against Him,
   ask forgiveness.

   2. Call to mind that the day now beginning is given you in order that
   you may work for Eternity, and make a stedfast resolution to use this
   day for that end.

   3. Consider beforehand what occupations, duties and occasions are
   likely this day to enable you to serve God; what temptations to offend
   Him, either by vanity, anger, etc., may arise; and make a fervent
   resolution to use all means of serving Him and confirming your own
   piety; as also to avoid and resist whatever might hinder your salvation
   and God's Glory. Nor is it enough to make such a resolution,--you must
   also prepare to carry it into effect. Thus, if you foresee having to
   meet some one who is hottempered and irritable, you must not merely
   resolve to guard your own temper, but you must consider by what gentle
   words to conciliate him. If you know you will see some sick person,
   consider how best to minister comfort to him, and so on.

   4. Next, humble yourself before God, confessing that of yourself you
   could carry out nothing that you have planned, either in avoiding evil
   or seeking good. Then, so to say, take your heart in your hands, and
   offer it and all your good intentions to God's Gracious Majesty,
   entreating Him to accept them, and strengthen you in His Service, which
   you may do in some such words as these: "Lord, I lay before Thee my
   weak heart, which Thou dost fill with good desires. Thou knowest that I
   am unable to bring the same to good effect, unless Thou dost bless and
   prosper them, and therefore, O Loving Father, I entreat of Thee to help
   me by the Merits and Passion of Thy Dear Son, to Whose Honour I would
   devote this day and my whole life."

   All these acts should be made briefly and heartily, before you leave
   your room if possible, so that all the coming work of the day may be
   prospered with God's blessing; but anyhow, my daughter, I entreat you
   never to omit them.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XI. Evening Prayer and Examination of Conscience.

   AS I have counselled you before your material dinner to make a
   spiritual repast in meditation, so before your evening meal you should
   make at least a devout spiritual collation. Make sure of some brief
   leisure before suppertime, and then prostrating yourself before God,
   and recollecting yourself in the Presence of Christ Crucified, setting
   Him before your mind with a stedfast inward glance, renew the warmth of
   your morning's meditation by some hearty aspirations and humble
   upliftings of your soul to your Blessed Saviour, either repeating those
   points of your meditation which helped you most, or kindling your heart
   with anything else you will.

   As to the examination of conscience, which we all should make before
   going to bed, you know the rules:

   1. Thank God for having preserved you through the day past.

   2. Examine how you have conducted yourself through the day, in order to
   which recall where and with whom you have been, and what you have done.

   3. If you have done anything good, offer thanks to God; if you have
   done amiss in thought, word, or deed, ask forgiveness of His Divine
   Majesty, resolving to confess the fault when opportunity offers, and to
   be diligent in doing better.

   4. Then commend your body and soul, the Church, your relations and
   friends, to God. Ask that the Saints and Angels may keep watch over
   you, and with God's Blessing go to the rest He has appointed for you.
   Neither this practice nor that of the morning should ever be omitted;
   by your morning prayer you open your soul's windows to the sunshine of
   Righteousness, and by your evening devotions you close them against the
   shades of hell.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XII. On Spiritual Retirement.

   THIS is a matter, dear daughter, to which I am very anxious to win your
   attention, for in it lies one of the surest means of spiritual
   progress. Strive as often as possible through the day to place yourself
   in God's Presence by some one of the methods already suggested.
   Consider what God does, and what you are doing;--you will see His Eyes
   ever fixed upon you in Love incomparable. "O my God," you will cry out,
   "why cannot I always be looking upon Thee, even as Thou lookest on me?
   why do I think so little about Thee? O my soul, thy only resting-place
   is God, and yet how often dost thou wander?" The birds have nests in
   lofty trees, and the stag his refuge in the thick coverts, where he can
   shelter from the sun's burning heat; and just so, my daughter, our
   hearts ought daily to choose some resting-place, either Mount Calvary,
   or the Sacred Wounds, or some other spot close to Christ, where they
   can retire at will to seek rest and refreshment amid toil, and to be as
   in a fortress, protected from temptation. Blessed indeed is the soul
   which can truly say, "Thou, Lord, art my Refuge, my Castle, my Stay, my
   Shelter in the storm and in the heat of the day."

   Be sure then, my child, that while externally occupied with business
   and social duties, you frequently retire within the solitude of your
   own heart. That solitude need not be in any way hindered by the crowds
   which surround you--they surround your body, not your soul, and your
   heart remains alone in the Sole Presence of God. This is what David
   sought after amid his manifold labours;--the Psalms are full of such
   expressions as "Lord, I am ever with Thee. The Lord is always at my
   right hand. I lift up mine eyes to Thee, O Thou Who dwellest in the
   heavens. Mine eyes look unto God."

   There are few social duties of sufficient importance to prevent an
   occasional retirement of the heart into this sacred solitude. When S.
   Catherine of Sienna was deprived by her parents of any place or time
   for prayer and meditation, Our Lord inspired her with the thought of
   making a little interior oratory in her mind, into which she could
   retire in heart, and so enjoy a holy solitude amid her outward duties.
   And henceforward, when the world assaulted her, she was able to be
   indifferent, because, so she said, she could retire within her secret
   oratory, and find comfort with her Heavenly Bridegroom. So she
   counselled her spiritual daughters to make a retirement within their
   heart, in which to dwell. Do you in like manner let your heart withdraw
   to such an inward retirement, where, apart from all men, you can lay it
   bare, and treat face to face with God, even as David says that he
   watched like a "pelican in the wilderness, or an owl in the desert, or
   a sparrow sitting alone upon the housetop." [34] These words have a
   sense beyond their literal meaning, or King David's habit of retirement
   for contemplation;--and we may find in them three excellent kinds of
   retreats in which to seek solitude after the Saviour's Example, Who is
   symbolised as He hung upon Mount Calvary by the pelican of the
   wilderness, feeding her young ones with her blood. [35] So again His
   Nativity in a lonely stable might find a foreshadowing in the owl of
   the desert, bemoaning and lamenting: and in His Ascension He was like
   the sparrow rising high above the dwellings of men. Thus in each of
   these ways we can make a retreat amid the daily cares of life and its
   business.

   When the blessed Elzear, Count of Arian-enProvence, had been long
   separated from his pious and beloved wife Delphine, she sent a
   messenger to inquire after him, and he returned answer, "I am well,
   dear wife, and if you would see me, seek me in the Wounded Side of our
   Dear Lord Jesus; that is my sure dwelling-place, and elsewhere you will
   seek me in vain." Surely he was a true Christian knight who spoke thus.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [34] Ps. cii. 6, 7.

   [35] The Egyptians used the pelican as a symbol of parental devotion;
   and among the early Christians, as may be seen in the Catacombs, it was
   employed to shadow forth the deep mysteries of Christ's love. On many a
   monumental brass, church window, or chalice of old time, occurs this
   device, with the motto, "Sic Christus dilexit nos." "Thus hath Christ
   loved us." And so Saint Thomas in his Eucharistic Hymn "Adoro Te
   devote,"--"Pie Pelicane, Jesu Domine, Me immundum munda, Tuo
   sausguine!"
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XIII. Aspirations, Ejaculatory Prayer and Holy Thoughts.

   WE retire with God, because we aspire to Him, and we aspire in order to
   retire with Him; so that aspiration after God and spiritual retreat
   excite one another, while both spring from the one Source of all holy
   thoughts. Do you then, my daughter, aspire continually to God, by
   brief, ardent upliftings of heart; praise His Excellence, invoke His
   Aid, cast yourself in spirit at the Foot of His Cross, adore His
   Goodness, offer your whole soul a thousand times a day to Him, fix your
   inward gaze upon Him, stretch out your hands to be led by Him, as a
   little child to its father, clasp Him to your breast as a fragrant
   nosegay, upraise Him in your soul as a standard. In short, kindle by
   every possible act your love for God, your tender, passionate desire
   for the Heavenly Bridegroom of souls. Such is ejaculatory prayer, as it
   was so earnestly inculcated by S. Augustine upon the devout Proba; and
   be sure, my daughter, that if you seek such nearness and intimacy with
   God your whole soul will imbibe the perfume of His Perfections. Neither
   is this a difficult practice,--it may be interwoven with all our duties
   and occupations, without hindering any; for neither the spiritual
   retreat of which I have spoken, nor these inward upliftings of the
   heart, cause more than a very brief distraction, which, so far from
   being any hindrance, will rather promote whatever you have in hand.
   When a pilgrim pauses an instant to take a draught of wine, which
   refreshes his lips and revives his heart, his onward journey is nowise
   hindered by the brief delay, but rather it is shortened and lightened,
   and he brings it all the sooner to a happy end, pausing but to advance
   the better.

   Sundry collections of ejaculatory prayer have been put forth, which are
   doubtless very useful, but I should advise you not to tie yourself to
   any formal words, but rather to speak with heart or mouth whatever
   springs forth from the love within you, which is sure to supply you
   with all abundance. There are certain utterances which have special
   force, such as the ejaculatory prayers of which the Psalms are so full,
   and the numerous loving invocations of Jesus which we find in the Song
   of Songs. Many hymns too may be used with the like intention, provided
   they are sung attentively. In short, just as those who are full of some
   earthly, natural love are ever turning in thought to the beloved one,
   their hearts overflowing with tenderness, and their lips ever ready to
   praise that beloved object; comforting themselves in absence by
   letters, carving the treasured name on every tree;--so those who love
   God cannot cease thinking of Him, living for Him, longing after Him,
   speaking of Him, and fain would they grave the Holy Name of Jesus in
   the hearts of every living creature they behold. And to such an outpour
   of love all creation bids us--nothing that He has made but is filled
   with the praise of God, and, as says S. Augustine, everything in the
   world speaks silently but clearly to the lovers of God of their love,
   exciting them to holy desires, whence gush forth aspirations and loving
   cries to God. St. Gregory Nazianzen tells his flock, how, walking along
   the seashore, he watched the waves as they washed up shells and sea
   weeds, and all manner of small substances, which seemed, as it were,
   rejected by the sea, until a return wave would often wash part thereof
   back again; while the rocks remained firm and immoveable, let the waves
   beat against them never so fiercely. And then the Saint went on to
   reflect that feeble hearts let themselves be carried hither and thither
   by the varying waves of sorrow or consolation, as the case might be,
   like the shells upon the seashore, while those of a nobler mould abide
   firm and immoveable amid every storm;--whence he breaks out into
   David's cry, "Lord, save me, for the waters are gone over my soul;
   deliver me from the great deep, all Thy waves and storms are gone over
   me;" for he was himself then in trouble by reason of the ungodly
   usurpation of his See by Maximus.

   When S. Fulgentius, Bishop of Ruspe, heard Theodoric, King of the
   Goths, harangue a general assembly of Roman nobles, and beheld their
   splendour, he exclaimed, "O God, how glorious must Thy Heavenly
   Jerusalem be, if even earthly Rome be thus!" [36] And if this world can
   afford so much gratification to mere earthly lovers of vanity, what
   must there be in store hereafter for those who love the truth?

   "If thus Thy lower works are fair,--If thus Thy glories gild the spanOf
   ruined earth and guilty man,--How glorious must the mansions beWhere
   Thy redeemed dwell with Thee!"

   We are told that S. Anselm of Canterbury, (our mountains may glory in
   being his birthplace [37] ) was much given to such thoughts. On one
   occasion a hunted hare took refuge from imminent death beneath the
   Bishop's horse, the hounds clamouring round, but not daring to drag it
   from its asylum, whereat his attendants began to laugh; but the great
   Anselm wept, saying, "You may laugh forsooth, but to the poor hunted
   beast it is no laughing matter; even so the soul which has been led
   astray in all manner of sin finds a host of enemies waiting at its last
   hour to devour it, and terrified, knows not where to seek a refuge, and
   if it can find none, its enemies laugh and rejoice." And so he went on
   his way, sighing.

   Constantine the Great wrote with great respect to S. Anthony, at which
   his religious expressed their surprise. "Do you marvel," he said, "that
   a king should write to an ordinary man? Marvel rather that God should
   have written His Law for men, and yet more that He should have spoken
   with them Face to face through His Son." When S. Francis saw a solitary
   sheep amid a flock of goats; "See," said he to his companion, "how
   gentle the poor sheep is among the goats, even as was Our Lord among
   the Pharisees;" and seeing a boar devour a little lamb, "Poor little
   one," he exclaimed, weeping, "how vividly is my Saviour's Death set
   forth in thee!"

   A great man of our own day, Francis Borgia, then Duke of Candia, was
   wont to indulge in many devout imaginations as he was hunting. "I used
   to ponder," he said, "how the falcon returns to one's wrist, and lets
   one hood its eyes or chain it to the perch, and yet men are so perverse
   in refusing to turn at God's call." St. Basil the Great says that the
   rose amid its thorns preaches a lesson to men. "All that is pleasant in
   this life" (so it tells us mortals) "is mingled with sadness--no joy is
   altogether pure--all enjoyment is liable to be marred by regrets,
   marriage is saddened by widowhood, children bring anxiety, glory often
   turns to shame, neglect follows upon honour, weariness on pleasure,
   sickness on health. Truly the rose is a lovely flower," the Saint goes
   on to say, "but it moves me to sadness, reminding me as it does that
   for my sin the earth was condemned to bring forth thorns."

   Another devout soul, gazing upon a brook wherein the starlit sky of a
   calm summer's night was reflected, exclaims, "O my God, when Thou
   callest me to dwell in Thy heavenly tabernacles, these stars will be
   beneath my feet; and even as those stars are now reflected here below,
   so are we Thy creatures reflected above in the living waters of Thy
   Divine Love." So another cried out, beholding a rapid river as it
   flowed, "Even thus my soul will know no rest until it plunge into that
   Divine Sea whence it came forth!" S. Frances, as she knelt to pray
   beside the banks of a pleasant streamlet, cried out in ecstasy, "The
   Grace of my Dear Lord flows softly and sweetly even as these refreshing
   waters" And another saintly soul, looking upon the blooming orchards,
   cried out, "Why am I alone barren in the Church's garden!" So S.
   Francis of Assisi, beholding a hen gathering her chickens beneath her
   wings, exclaimed, "Keep me, O Lord, under the shadow of Thy Wings" And
   looking upon the sunflower, he ejaculated, "When, O Lord, will my soul
   follow the attractions of Thy Love?" [38] And gathering pansies in a
   garden which are fair to see, but scentless, [39] "Ah," he cried out,
   "even so are the thoughts of my heart, fair to behold, but without
   savour or fruit!"

   Thus it is, my daughter, that good thoughts and holy aspirations may be
   drawn from all that surrounds us in our ordinary life. Woe to them that
   turn aside the creature from the Creator, and thrice blessed are they
   who turn all creation to their Creator's Glory, and make human vanities
   subservient to the truth. "Verily," says Saint Gregory Nazianzen, "I am
   wont to turn all things to my spiritual profit."

   Read the pious epitaph written for S. Paula by S. Jerome; it is
   marvellous therein to see how she conceived spiritual thoughts and
   aspirations at every turn.

   Now, in the practice of this spiritual retreat and of these ejaculatory
   prayers the great work of devotion lies: it can supply all other
   deficiencies, but there is hardly any means of making up where this is
   lacking. Without it no one can lead a true contemplative life, and the
   active life will be but imperfect where it is omitted: without it rest
   is but indolence, labour but weariness,--therefore I beseech you to
   adopt it heartily, and never let it go.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [36] Was it in imitation of this that the hymn was written?

   [37] S. Anselm was born at Aosta in Piedmont, A.D. 1033.

   [38] Moore has preserved the graceful imagery of the sunflower,
   anciently called "tourne-soleil" (as by S. Francis here). "Oh the heart
   that once truly loved, never forgets, But as truly loves on to the
   close, As the sunflower turns to her God when he sets The same look
   which she turned when he rose."

   [39] "Pensees." This play on words is common--as Ophelia says in
   Hamlet, Act iv. sc. 5: "There is pansies--that's for thoughts." But the
   name of this pretty viola is really derived from panacea, signifying
   all-heal, just as Tansy is derived from Athanasia, i.e. immortelle or
   everlasting. Its other name of heart's-ease also refers to the potent
   virtues ascribed to it of old. Cawdray, in his Treasurie of Similies,
   London, 1609, says: "As the herb Panax or Panace hath in it a remedy
   against all diseases, so is the Death of Christ against all sin
   sufficient and effectual." In the preface to our English Bible of 1611,
   the translators speak of "Panaces, the herb that is good for all
   diseases."
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XIV. Of Holy Communion, and how to join in it.

   1. SO far I have said nothing concerning the Sun of all spiritual
   exercises, even the most holy, sacred and Sovereign Sacrifice and
   Sacrament of the Eucharist,--the very centre point of our Christian
   religion, the heart of all devotion, the soul of piety;--that Ineffable
   Mystery which embraces the whole depth of Divine Love, by which God,
   giving Himself really to us, conveys all His Graces and favours to men
   with royal magnificence.

   2. Prayer made in union with this Divine Sacrifice has untold power;
   through which, indeed, the soul overflows with heavenly grace, and
   leaning on her Beloved, becomes so filled with spiritual sweetness and
   perfume, that we may ask in the words of the Canticles: "Who is this
   that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with
   myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the merchant? " [40]

   3. Strive then to your utmost to be present every day at this holy
   Celebration, in order that with the priest you may offer the Sacrifice
   of your Redeemer on behalf of yourself and the whole Church to God the
   Father. Saint Chrysostom says that the Angels crowd around it in
   adoration, and if we are found together with them, united in one
   intention, we cannot but be most favourably influenced by such society.
   Moreover, all the heavenly choirs of the Church triumphant, as well as
   those of the Church militant, are joined to our Dear Lord in this
   divine act, so that with Him, in Him, and by Him, they may win the
   favour of God the Father, and obtain His Mercy for us. How great the
   blessing to my soul to contribute its share towards the attainment of
   so gracious a gift!

   4. If any imperative hindrance prevents your presence at this sovereign
   sacrifice of Christ's most true Presence, at least be sure to take part
   in it spiritually. If you cannot go to Church, choose some morning hour
   in which to unite your intention to that of the whole Christian world,
   and make the same interior acts of devotion wherever you are that you
   would make if you were really present at the Celebration of the Holy
   Eucharist in Church.

   5. In order to join in this rightly, whether actually or mentally, you
   must give heed to several things: (1) In the beginning, and before the
   priest goes up to the Altar, make your preparation with his--placing
   yourself in God's Presence, confessing your unworthiness, and asking
   forgiveness. (2) Until the Gospel, dwell simply and generally upon the
   Coming and the Life of our Lord in this world. (3) From the Gospel to
   the end of the Creed, dwell upon our Dear Lord's teaching, and renew
   your resolution to live and die in the faith of the Holy Catholic
   Church. (4) From thence, fix your heart on the mysteries of the Word,
   and unite yourself to the Death and Passion of our Redeemer, now
   actually and essentially set forth in this holy Sacrifice, which,
   together with the priest and all the congregation, you offer to God the
   Father, to His Glory and your own salvation. (5) Up to the moment of
   communicating, offer all the longings and desires of your heart, above
   all desiring most earnestly to be united for ever to our Saviour by His
   Eternal Love. (6) From the time of Communion to the end, thank His
   Gracious Majesty for His Incarnation, His Life, Death, Passion, and the
   Love which He sets forth in this holy Sacrifice, intreating through it
   His favour for yourself, your relations and friends, and the whole
   Church; and humbling yourself sincerely, devoutly receive the blessing
   which our Dear Lord gives you through the channel of His minister. If,
   however, you wish to follow your daily course of meditation on special
   mysteries during the Sacrifice, it is not necessary that you should
   interrupt yourself by making these several acts but it will suffice
   that at the beginning you dispose your intention to worship and to
   offer the holy Sacrifice in your meditation and prayer; since every
   meditation includes all the abovenamed acts either explicitly or
   implicitly.

CHAPTER XV. Of the other Public Offices of the Church.

   FURTHERMORE, my daughter, you should endeavour to assist at the
   Offices, Hours, Vespers, etc., as far as you are able, especially on
   Sundays and Festivals, days which are dedicated to God, wherein we
   ought to strive to do more for His Honour and Glory than on others. You
   will greatly increase the fervour of your devotion by so doing, even as
   did S. Augustine, who tells us in his Confessions, that in the early
   days of his conversion he was touched to the quick, and his heart
   overflowed in happy tears, when he took part in the Offices of the
   Church. [41] Moreover (let me say it here once for all), there is
   always more profit and more consolation in the public Offices of the
   Church than in private acts of devotion, God having willed to give the
   preference to communion in prayer over all individual action. Be ready
   to take part in any confraternities and associations you may find in
   the place where you are called to dwell, especially such as are most
   fruitful and edifying. This will be pleasing to God; for although
   confraternities are not ordained, they are recommended by the Church,
   which grants various privileges to those who are united thereby. And it
   is always a work of love to join with others and take part in their
   good works. And although it may be possible that you can use equally
   profitable devotions by yourself as in common with others,--perhaps
   even you may like doing so best,--nevertheless God is more glorified
   when we unite with our brethren and neighbours and join our offerings
   to theirs.

   I say the same concerning all public services and prayers, in which, as
   far as possible, each one of us is bound to contribute the best example
   we can for our neighbour's edification, and our hearty desire for God's
   Glory and the general good of all men.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [41] "Nor was I sated in those days with the wondrous sweetness of
   considering the depth of Thy counsels concerning the salvation of
   mankind. How did I weep, in Thy hymns and canticles, touched to the
   quick by the voices of Thy sweet-attuned church The voices flowed into
   mine ears, and the truth distilled into my heart, whence the affections
   of my devotion overflowed, and tears ran down, and happy was I
   therein."--conf. bk. ix. 14.

CHAPTER XVI. How the Saints are united to us.

   INASMUCH as God continually sends us inspirations by means of His
   Angels, we may fitly send back our aspirations through the same
   channel. The souls of the holy dead, resting in Paradise, who are, as
   our Lord Himself has told us, "as the Angels in Heaven," [42] are also
   united to us in their prayers. My child, let us gladly join our hearts
   with these heavenly blessed ones; for even as the newly-fledged
   nightingale learns to sing from the elder birds, so by our sacred
   communing with the Saints we shall learn better to pray and sing the
   praises of the Lord. David is continually uniting his prayers with
   those of all the Saints and Angels.

   Honour, revere and respect the Blessed Virgin Mary with a very special
   love; she is the Mother of our Sovereign Lord, and so we are her
   children. Let us think of her with all the love and confidence of
   affectionate children; let us desire her love, and strive with true
   filial hearts to imitate her graces.

   Seek to be familiar with the Angels; learn to realise that they are
   continually present, although invisible. Specially love and revere the
   Guardian Angel of the Diocese in which you live, those of the friends
   who surround you, and your own. Commune with them frequently, join in
   their songs of praise, and seek their protection and help in all you
   do, spiritual or temporal.

   That pious man Peter Faber, the first companion of Saint Ignatius, and
   the first priest, first preacher and first theological teacher of the
   Company of the Jesuits, who was a native of our Diocese, [43] once
   passing through this country on his way from Germany, (where he had
   been labouring for God's Glory,) told how great comfort he had found as
   he went among places infested with heresy in communing with the
   guardian Angels thereof, whose help had often preserved him from
   danger, and softened hearts to receive the faith. He spoke with such
   earnestness, that a lady who, when quite young, heard him, was so
   impressed, that she repeated his words to me only four years ago, sixty
   years after their utterance, with the utmost feeling. I had the
   happiness only last year of consecrating an altar in the place where it
   pleased God to give that blessed man birth, the little village of
   Villaret, amid the wildest of our mountains.

   You will do well to choose out for yourself some individual Saint,
   whose life specially to study and imitate, and whose prayers may be
   more particularly offered on your behalf. The Saint bearing your own
   baptismal name would seem to be naturally assigned to you.

CHAPTER XVII. How to Hear and Read God's Word.

   CULTIVATE a special devotion to God's Word, whether studied privately
   or in public; always listen to it with attention and reverence, strive
   to profit by it, and do not let it fall to the ground, but receive it
   within your heart as a precious balm, thereby imitating the Blessed
   Virgin, who "kept all these sayings in her heart." [44] Remember that
   our Lord receives our words of prayer according to the way in which we
   receive His words in teaching.

   You should always have some good devout book at hand, such as the
   writings of S. Bonaventura, Gerson, Denis the Carthusian, Blosius,
   Grenada, Stella, Arias, Pinella, Da Ponte, Avila, the Spiritual Combat,
   the Confessions of S. Augustine, S. Jerome's Epistles, or the like; and
   daily read some small portion attentively, as though you were reading
   letters sent by the Saints from Paradise to teach you the way thither,
   and encourage you to follow them. Read the Lives of the Saints too,
   which are as a mirror to you of Christian life, and try to imitate
   their actions according to your circumstances; for although many things
   which the Saints did may not be practicable for those who live in the
   world, they may be followed more or less. Thus, in our spiritual
   retreats we imitate the solitude of the first hermit, S. Paul; in the
   practice of poverty we imitate S. Francis, and so on. Of course some
   Lives throw much more light upon our daily course than others, such as
   the Life of Saint Theresa, which is most admirable, the first Jesuits,
   Saint Charles Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan, S. Louis, S. Bernard, S.
   Francis, and such like. Others are more the subjects of our admiring
   wonder than of imitation, such as S. Mary of Egypt, S. Simeon Stylites,
   S. Catherine of Genoa, and S. Catherine of Sienna, S. Angela, etc.,
   although these should tend to kindle a great love of God in our hearts.

CHAPTER XVIII. How to receive Inspirations.

   BY inspirations I mean all drawings, feelings, interior reproaches,
   lights and intuitions, with which God moves us, preventing our hearts
   by His Fatherly love and care, and awakening, exciting, urging, and
   attracting them to goodness, to Heavenly love, to good resolutions, in
   short, to whatever tends to our eternal welfare. This it is of which we
   read in the Canticles, when the Bridegroom knocks at the door, awakens
   His beloved, calls upon her, seeks her, bids her eat of His honey,
   gather the fruit and flowers of His garden, and let Him hear her voice,
   which is sweet to Him. [45]

   Let me make use of an illustration of my meaning. In contracting a
   marriage, the bride must be a party to three separate acts: first, the
   bridegroom is proposed to her; secondly, she entertains the proposal;
   and thirdly, she gives her consent. Just so when God intends to perform
   some act of love in us, by us, and with us; He first suggests it by His
   inspiration; secondly, we receive that inspiration; and thirdly, we
   consent to it: for, like as we fall into sin by three steps,
   temptation, delectation, and consent, so there are three steps whereby
   we ascend to virtue; inspiration, as opposed to temptation; delectation
   in God's inspiration, as opposed to that of temptation; and consent to
   the one instead of to the other. Were God's inspirations to last all
   our lives, we should be nowise more acceptable to Him, unless we took
   pleasure therein; on the contrary, we should rather offend Him as did
   the Israelites, of whom He says that they "grieved Him for forty years
   long, refusing to hear His pleadings, so that at last" I "sware in My
   wrath that they should not enter into My rest." [46] And (to recur to
   my first illustration) one who has long been devoted to his lady-love,
   would feel greatly injured if, after all, she would not consent to the
   alliance he seeks.

   The delight we take in God's inspirations is an important step gained
   towards His Glory, and we begin at once to please Him thereby; for
   although such delectation is not the same thing as a full consent, it
   shows a strong tendency thereto; and if it is a good and profitable
   sign when we take pleasure in hearing God's Word, which is, so to say,
   an external inspiration, still more is it good and acceptable in His
   Sight when we take delight in His interior inspirations. Such is the
   delight of which the Bride says, "My soul melted within me when my
   Beloved spake." [47] And so, too, the earthly lover is well satisfied
   when he sees that his lady-love finds pleasure in his attentions.

   But, after all, consent only perfects the good action; for if we are
   inspired of God, and take pleasure in that inspiration, and yet,
   nevertheless, refuse our consent to His inspiration, we are acting a
   very contemptuous, offensive part towards Him. We read of the Bride,
   that although the voice of her Beloved touched her heart, she made
   trivial excuses, and delayed opening the door to Him, and so He
   withdrew Himself and "was gone." [48] And the earthly lover, who had
   long sought a lady, and seemed acceptable to her, would have the more
   ground for complaint if at last he was spurned and dismissed, than if
   he had never been favourably received.

   Do you, my daughter, resolve to accept whatever inspirations God may
   vouchsafe you, heartily; and when they offer themselves, receive them
   as the ambassadors of your Heavenly King, seeking alliance with you.
   Hearken gently to their propositions, foster the love with which you
   are inspired, and cherish the holy Guest. Give your consent, and let it
   be a full, loving, stedfast consent to His holy inspirations; for, so
   doing, God will reckon your affection as a favour, although truly we
   can confer none upon Him. But, before consenting to inspirations which
   have respect to important or extraordinary things, guard against
   self-deception, by consulting your spiritual guide, and let him examine
   whether the inspiration be real or no; and that the rather, because
   when the enemy sees a soul ready to hearken to inspirations, he is wont
   to set false delusions in the way to deceive it,--a snare you will not
   fall into so long as you humbly obey your guide.

   Consent once given, you must carefully seek to produce the intended
   results, and carry out the inspiration, the crown of true virtue; for
   to give consent, without producing the result thereof, were like
   planting a vine without meaning it to bear fruit. All this will be
   greatly promoted by careful attention to your morning exercises, and
   the spiritual retirement already mentioned, because therein you learn
   to carry general principles to a special application.

CHAPTER XIX. On Confession.

   OUR Saviour has bequeathed the Sacrament of Penitence and Confession to
   His Church, [49] in order that therein we may be cleansed from all our
   sins, however and whenever we may have been soiled thereby. Therefore,
   my child, never allow your heart to abide heavy with sin, seeing that
   there is so sure and safe a remedy at hand. If the lioness has been in
   the neighbourhood of other beasts she hastens to wash away their scent,
   lest it should be displeasing to her lord; and so the soul which has
   ever so little consented to sin, ought to abhor itself and make haste
   to seek purification, out of respect to His Divine Gaze Who beholds it
   always. Why should we die a spiritual death when there is a sovereign
   remedy available?

   Make your confession humbly and devoutly every week, and always, if you
   can, before communicating, even although your conscience is not
   burdened with mortal sin; for in confession you do not only receive
   absolution for your venial sins, but you also receive great strength to
   help you in avoiding them henceforth, clearer light to discover your
   failings, and abundant grace to make up whatever loss you have incurred
   through those faults. You exercise the graces of humility, obedience,
   simplicity and love, and by this one act of confession you practise
   more virtue than in any other.

   Be sure always to entertain a hearty sorrow for the sins you confess,
   however small they are; as also a stedfast resolution to correct them
   in future. Some people go on confessing venial sins out of mere habit,
   and conventionally, without making any effort to correct them, thereby
   losing a great deal of spiritual good. Supposing that you confess
   having said something untrue, although without evil consequences, or
   some careless words, or excessive amusement;--repent, and make a firm
   resolution of amendment: it is a mere abuse to confess any sin
   whatever, be it mortal or venial, without intending to put it
   altogether away, that being the express object of confession.

   Beware of unmeaning self-accusations, made out of a mere routine, such
   as, "I have not loved God as much as I ought; I have not prayed with as
   much devotion as I ought; I

   have not loved my neighbour as I ought; I have not received the
   Sacraments with sufficient reverence;" and the like. Such things as
   these are altogether useless in setting the state of your conscience
   before your Confessor, inasmuch as all the Saints in Paradise and all
   men living would say the same. But examine closely what special reason
   you have for accusing yourself thus, and when you have discovered it,
   accuse yourself simply and plainly of your fault. For instance, when
   confessing that you have not loved your neighbour as you ought, it may
   be that what you mean is, that having seen some one in great want whom
   you could have succoured, you have failed to do so. Well then, accuse
   yourself of that special omission: say, "Having come across a person in
   need, I did not help him as I might have done," either through
   negligence, or hardness, or indifference, according as the case may be.
   So again, do not accuse yourself of not having prayed to God with
   sufficient devotion; but if you have given way to voluntary
   distractions, or if you have neglected the proper circumstances of
   devout prayer--whether place, time, or attitude--say so plainly, just
   as it is, and do not deal in generalities, which, so to say, blow
   neither hot nor cold.

   Again, do not be satisfied with mentioning the bare fact of your venial
   sins, but accuse yourself of the motive cause which led to them. For
   instance, do not be content with saying that you told an untruth which
   injured no one; but say whether it was out of vanity, in order to win
   praise or avoid blame, out of heedlessness, or from obstinacy. If you
   have exceeded in society, say whether it was from the love of talking,
   or gambling for the sake of money, and so on. Say whether you continued
   long to commit the fault in question, as the importance of a fault
   depends greatly upon its continuance: e.g., there is a wide difference
   between a passing act of vanity which is over in a quarter of an hour,
   and one which fills the heart for one or more days. So you must mention
   the fact, the motive and the duration of your faults. It is true that
   we are not bound to be so precise in confessing venial sins, or even,
   technically speaking, to confess them at all; but all who aim at
   purifying their souls in order to attain a really devout life, will be
   careful to show all their spiritual maladies, however slight, to their
   spiritual physician, in order to be healed.

   Do not spare yourself in telling whatever is necessary to explain the
   nature of your fault, as, for instance, the reason why you lost your
   temper, or why you encouraged another in wrong-doing. Thus, some one
   whom I dislike says a chance word in joke, I take it ill, and put
   myself in a passion. If one I like had said a stronger thing I should
   not have taken it amiss; so in confession, I ought to say that I lost
   my temper with a person, not because of the words spoken so much as
   because I disliked the speaker; and if in order to explain yourself
   clearly it is necessary to particularize the words, it is well to do
   so; because accusing one's self thus simply one discovers not merely
   one's actual sins, but one's bad habits, inclinations and ways, and the
   other roots of sin, by which means one's spiritual Father acquires a
   fuller knowledge of the heart he is dealing with, and knows better what
   remedies to apply. But you must always avoid exposing any one who has
   borne any part in your sin as far as possible. Keep watch over a
   variety of sins, which are apt to spring up and flourish, often
   insensibly, in the conscience, so that you may confess them and put
   them away; and with this view read Chapters VI., XXVII., XXVIII.,
   XXIX., XXXV. and XXXVI. of Part III., and Chapter VII. of Part IV.,
   attentively.

   Do not lightly change your Confessor, but having chosen him, be regular
   in giving account of your conscience to him at the appointed seasons,
   telling him your faults simply and frankly, and from time to time--say
   every month or every two months, show him the general state of your
   inclinations, although there be nothing wrong in them; as, for
   instance, whether you are depressed and anxious, or cheerful, desirous
   of advancement, or money, and the like.

CHAPTER XX. Of Frequent Communion.

   IT is said that Mithridates, King of Pontus, who invented the poison
   called after him, mithridate, so thoroughly impregnated his system with
   it, that when eventually he tried to poison himself to avoid becoming
   the Romans' slave, he never could succeed. The Saviour instituted the
   most holy Sacrament of the Eucharist, really containing His Body and
   His Blood, in order that they who eat it might live for ever. And
   therefore whosoever receives it frequently and devoutly, so strengthens
   the health and life of his soul, that it is hardly possible for him to
   be poisoned by any evil desires. We cannot be fed by that Living Flesh
   and hold to the affections of death; and just as our first parents
   could not die in Paradise, because of the Tree of Life which God had
   placed therein, so this Sacrament of Life makes spiritual death
   impossible. The most fragile, easily spoilt fruits, such as cherries,
   apricots, and strawberries, can be kept all the year by being preserved
   in sugar or honey; so what wonder if our hearts, frail and weakly as
   they are, are kept from the corruption of sin when they are preserved
   in the sweetness ("sweeter than honey and the honeycomb") of the
   Incorruptible Body and Blood of the Son of God. O my daughter, those
   Christians who are lost will indeed have no answer to give when the
   Just Judge sets before them that they have voluntarily died the
   spiritual death, since it was so easy for them to have preserved life
   and health, by eating His Body which He gave them for that very end.
   "Miserable men!" He will say, "wherefore would ye die, with the Bread
   of Life itself in your hands?"

   As to daily Communion, I neither commend nor condemn it; but with
   respect to communicating every Sunday, I counsel and exhort every one
   to do so, providing the mind has no attachment to sin. So says S.
   Augustine, and with him I neither find fault nor unconditionally
   commend daily Communion, leaving that matter to the discretion of every
   person's own spiritual Guide; as the requisite dispositions for such
   frequent Communion are too delicate for one to advise it
   indiscriminately. On the other hand, these very special dispositions
   may be found in sundry devout souls, and therefore it would not be well
   to discourage everybody. It is a subject which must be dealt with
   according to each individual mind; it were imprudent to advise such
   frequent Communion to all, while, on the other hand, it would be
   presumptuous to blame any one for it, especially if he therein follows
   the advice of some wise director. Saint Catherine of Sienna, when
   blamed for her frequent Communions, under the plea that Saint Augustine
   neither commended nor condemned daily Communion, replied gently, "Well,
   then, since Saint Augustine does not condemn it, neither, I pray you,
   do you condemn it, and I shall be content." But Saint Augustine
   earnestly exhorts all to communicate every Sunday. And as I presume, my
   daughter, that you have no attachment either to mortal or venial sins,
   you are in the condition which Saint Augustine requires; and if your
   spiritual Father approves, you may profitably communicate more
   frequently. Nevertheless, there are various hindrances which may arise,
   not so much from yourself, as from those among whom you live, which may
   lead a wise director to tell you not to communicate so often. For
   instance, if you are in a position of subjection, and those whom you
   are bound to obey should be so ignorant or so prejudiced, as to be
   uneasy at your frequent Communions, all things considered, it may be
   well to show consideration for their weakness, and to make your
   Communion fortnightly; only, of course, where there is no possible way
   of overcoming the difficulty otherwise. But one cannot give any general
   rule on such a point, each person must follow the advice of their own
   spiritual Guide; only this much I will say, that monthly Communions are
   the very fewest which any one seeking to serve God devoutly can make.

   If you are discreet, neither father nor mother, husband nor wife, will
   ever hinder you from communicating frequently, and that because on the
   day of your Communion you will give good heed always to be more than
   usually gentle and amiable towards them, doing all you can to please
   them, so that they are not likely to prevent your doing a thing which
   in nowise inconveniences themselves, unless they were most particularly
   unreasonable and perverse, in which case, as I have said, your Director
   might advise you to yield. There is nothing in the married life to
   hinder frequent Communion. Most certainly the Christians of the
   Primitive Church communicated daily, whether married or single. Neither
   is any malady a necessary impediment, except, indeed, anything
   producing constant sickness.

   Those who communicate weekly must be free from mortal sin, and also
   from any attachment to venial sin, and they should feel a great desire
   for Communion; but for daily Communion people should furthermore have
   conquered most of their inclinations to evil, and no one should
   practise it without the advice of their spiritual Guide.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXI. How to Communicate.

   BEGIN your preparation over-night, by sundry aspirations and loving
   ejaculations. Go to bed somewhat earlier than usual, so that you may
   get up earlier the next morning; and if you should wake during the
   night, fill your heart and lips at once with sacred words wherewith to
   make your soul ready to receive the Bridegroom, Who watches while you
   sleep, and Who intends to give you countless gifts and graces, if you
   on your part are prepared to accept them. In the morning rise with
   joyful expectation of the Blessing you hope for, and (having made your
   Confession) go with the fullest trust, but at the same time with the
   fullest humility, to receive that Heavenly Food which will sustain your
   immortal life. And after having said the sacred words, "Lord, I am not
   worthy," do not make any further movement whatever, either in prayer or
   otherwise, but gently opening your mouth, in the fulness of faith,
   hope, and love, receive Him in Whom, by Whom, and through Whom, you
   believe, hope, and love. O my child, bethink you that just as the bee,
   having gathered heaven's dew and earth's sweetest juices from amid the
   flowers, carries it to her hive; so the Priest, having taken the
   Saviour, God's Own Son, Who came down from Heaven, the Son of Mary, Who
   sprang up as earth's choicest flower, from the Altar, feeds you with
   that Bread of Sweetness and of all delight. When you have received it
   kindle your heart to adore the King of our Salvation, tell Him of all
   your own personal matters, and realise that He is within you, seeking
   your best happiness. In short, give Him the very best reception you
   possibly can, and act so that in all you do it may be evident that God
   is with you. When you cannot have the blessing of actual Communion, at
   least communicate in heart and mind, uniting yourself by ardent desire
   to the Life-giving Body of the Saviour.

   Your main intention in Communion should be to grow, strengthen, and
   abound in the Love of God; for Love's Sake receive that which Love
   Alone gives you. Of a truth there is no more loving or tender aspect in
   which to gaze upon the Saviour than this act, in which He, so to say,
   annihilates Himself, and gives Himself to us as food, in order to fill
   our souls, and to unite Himself more closely to the heart and flesh of
   His faithful ones.

   If men of the world ask why you communicate so often, tell them that it
   is that you may learn to love God; that you may be cleansed from
   imperfections, set free from trouble, comforted in affliction,
   strengthened in weakness. Tell them that there are two manner of men
   who need frequent Communion--those who are perfect, since being ready
   they were much to blame did they not come to the Source and Fountain of
   all perfection; and the imperfect, that they may learn how to become
   perfect; the strong, lest they become weak, and the weak, that they may
   become strong; the sick that they may be healed, and the sound lest
   they sicken. Tell them that you, imperfect, weak and ailing, need
   frequently to communicate with your Perfection, your Strength, your
   Physician. Tell them that those who are but little engaged in worldly
   affairs should communicate often, because they have leisure; and those
   who are heavily pressed with business, because they stand so much in
   need of help; and he who is hard worked needs frequent and substantial
   food. Tell them that you receive the Blessed Sacrament that you may
   learn to receive it better; one rarely does that well which one seldom
   does. Therefore, my child, communicate frequently,--as often as you
   can, subject to the advice of your spiritual Father. Our mountain hares
   turn white in winter, because they live in, and feed upon, the snow,
   and by dint of adoring and feeding upon Beauty, Goodness, and Purity
   itself in this most Divine Sacrament you too will become lovely, holy,
   pure.

        PART III. CONTAINING COUNSELS CONCERNING THE PRACTICE OF VIRTUE.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER I. How to select that which we should chiefly Practise.

   THE queen bee never takes wing without being surrounded by all her
   Subjects; even so Love never enters the heart but it is sure to bring
   all other virtues in its train; marshalling and employing them as a
   captain his soldiers; yet, nevertheless, Love does not set them all to
   work suddenly, or equally, at all times and everywhere. The righteous
   man is "like a tree planted by the water side, that will bring forth
   his fruit in due season;" [50] inasmuch as Love, watering and
   refreshing the soul, causes it to bring forth good works, each in
   season as required. There is an old proverb to the effect that the
   sweetest music is unwelcome at a time of mourning; and certain persons
   have made a great mistake when, seeking to cultivate some special
   virtue, they attempt to obtrude it on all occasions, like the ancient
   philosophers we read of, who were always laughing or weeping. Worse
   still if they take upon themselves to censure those who do not make a
   continual study of this their pet virtue. S. Paul tells us to "rejoice
   with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep;" [51] and
   Charity is patient, kind, liberal, prudent, indulgent.

   At the same time, there are virtues of universal account, which must
   not only be called into occasional action, but ought to spread their
   influence over everything. We do not very often come across
   opportunities for exercising strength, magnanimity, or magnificence;
   but gentleness, temperance, modesty, and humility, are graces which
   ought to colour everything we do. There may be virtues of a more
   exalted mould, but at all events these are the most continually called
   for in daily life. Sugar is better than salt, but we use salt more
   generally and oftener. Consequently, it is well to have a good and
   ready stock in hand of those general virtues of which we stand in so
   perpetual a need.

   In practising any virtue, it is well to choose that which is most
   according to our duty, rather than most according to our taste. It was
   Saint Paula's liking to practise bodily mortifications with a view to
   the keener enjoyment of spiritual sweetness, but obedience to her
   superiors was a higher duty; and therefore Saint Jerome acknowledges
   that she was wrong in practising excessive abstinence contrary to the
   advice of her Bishop. And the Apostles, whose mission it was to preach
   the Gospel, and feed souls with the Bread of Life, judged well that it
   was not right for them to hinder this holy work in order to minister to
   the material wants of the poor, weighty as that work was also. [52]
   Every calling stands in special need of some special virtue; those
   required of a prelate, a prince, or a soldier, are quite different; so
   are those beseeming a wife or a widow, and although all should possess
   every virtue, yet all are not called upon to exercise them equally, but
   each should cultivate chiefly those which are important to the manner
   of life to which he is called.

   Among such virtues as have no special adaptation to our own calling,
   choose the most excellent, not the most showy. A comet generally looks
   larger than the stars, and fills the eye more; but all the while comets
   are not nearly so important as the stars, and only seem so large to us
   because they are nearer to us than stars, and are of a grosser kind. So
   there are certain virtues which touch us very sensibly and are very
   material, so to say, and therefore ordinary people give them the
   preference. Thus the common run of men ordinarily value temporal
   almsgiving more than spiritual; and think more of fasting, exterior
   discipline and bodily mortification than of meekness, cheerfulness,
   modesty, and other interior mortifications, which nevertheless are far
   better. Do you then, my daughter, choose the best virtues, not those
   which are most highly esteemed; the most excellent, not the most
   visible; the truest, not the most conspicuous.

   It is well for everybody to select some special virtue at which to aim,
   not as neglecting any others, but as an object and pursuit to the mind.
   Saint John, Bishop of Alexandria, saw a vision of a lovely maiden,
   brighter than the sun, in shining garments, and wearing an olive crown,
   who said to him, "I am the King's eldest daughter, and if thou wilt
   have me for thy friend, I will bring thee to see His Face." Then he
   knew that it was pity for the poor which God thus commended to him, and
   from that time he gave himself so heartily to practise it, that he is
   universally known as Saint John the Almoner. Eulogius Alexandrinus
   desired to devote himself wholly to God, but he had not courage either
   to adopt the solitary life, or to put himself under obedience, and
   therefore he took a miserable beggar, seething in dirt and leprosy, to
   live with him; and to do this more thoroughly, he vowed to honour and
   serve him as a servant does his lord and master. After a while, both
   feeling greatly tempted to part company, they referred to the great
   Saint Anthony, who said, "Beware of separating, my sons, for you are
   both near your end, and if the Angel find you not together, you will be
   in danger of losing your crowns."

   Saint Louis counted it a privilege to visit the hospitals, where he
   used to tend the sick with his own royal hands. Saint Francis loved
   poverty above all things, and called her his lady-love. Saint Dominic
   gave himself up to preaching, whence his Order takes its name. [53]
   Saint Gregory the Great specially delighted to receive pilgrims after
   the manner of faithful Abraham, and like him entertained the King of
   Glory under a pilgrim's garb. Tobit devoted himself to the charitable
   work of burying the dead. Saint Elizabeth, albeit a mighty princess,
   loved above all things to humble herself. When Saint Catherine of Genoa
   became a widow, she gave herself up to work in an hospital. Cassian
   relates how a certain devout maiden once besought Saint Athanasius to
   help her in cultivating the grace of patience; and he gave her a poor
   widow as companion, who was cross, irritable, and altogether
   intolerable, and whose perpetual fretfulness gave the pious lady
   abundant opportunity of practising gentleness and patience. And so some
   of God's servants devote themselves to nursing the sick, helping the
   poor, teaching little children in the faith, reclaiming the fallen,
   building churches, and adorning the altar, making peace among men.
   Therein they resemble embroidresses who work all manner of silks, gold
   and silver on various grounds, so producing beautiful flowers. Just so
   the pious souls who undertake some special devout practice use it as
   the ground of their spiritual embroidery, and frame all manner of other
   graces upon it, ordering their actions and affections better by means
   of this their chief thread which runs through all.

   "Upon Thy Right Hand did stand the Queen in a vesture of gold wrought
   about with divers colours." [54]

   When we are beset by any particular vice, it is well as far as possible
   to make the opposite virtue our special aim, and turn everything to
   that account; so doing, we shall overcome our enemy, and meanwhile make
   progress in all virtue. Thus, if I am beset with pride or anger, I must
   above all else strive to cultivate humility and gentleness, and I must
   turn all my religious exercises,--prayer, sacraments, prudence,
   constancy, moderation, to the same object. The wild boar sharpens its
   tusks by grinding them against its other teeth, which by the same
   process are sharpened and pointed; and so when a good man endeavours to
   perfect himself in some virtue which he is conscious of specially
   needing, he ought to give it edge and point by the aid of other
   virtues, which will themselves be confirmed and strengthened as he uses
   them with that object. It was so with Job, who, while specially
   exercising the virtue of patience amid the numberless temptations which
   beset him, was confirmed in all manner of holiness and godly virtues.
   And Saint Gregory Nazianzen says, that sometimes a person has attained
   the height of goodness by one single act of virtue, performed with the
   greatest perfection; instancing Rahab as an example, who, having
   practised the virtue of hospitality very excellently, reached a high
   point of glory. [55] Of course, any such action must needs be performed
   with a very exceeding degree of fervour and charity.

CHAPTER II. The same Subject continued.

   SAINT AUGUSTINE says very admirably, that beginners in devotion are
   wont to commit certain faults which, while they are blameable according
   to the strict laws of perfection, are yet praiseworthy by reason of the
   promise they hold forth of a future excellent goodness, to which they
   actually tend. For instance, that common shrinking fear which gives
   rise to an excessive scrupulosity in the souls of some who are but just
   set free from a course of sin, is commendable at that early stage, and
   is the almost certain forerunner of future purity of conscience. But
   this same fear would be blameable in those who are farther advanced,
   because love should reign in their hearts, and love is sure to drive
   away all such servile fear by degrees.

   In his early days, Saint Bernard was very severe and harsh towards
   those whom he directed, telling them, to begin with, that they must put
   aside the body, and come to him with their minds only. In confession,
   he treated all faults, however small, with extreme severity, and his
   poor apprentices in the study of perfection were so urged onwards, that
   by dint of pressing he kept them back, for they lost heart and breath
   when they found themselves thus driven up so steep and high an ascent.
   Therein, my daughter, you can see that, although it was his ardent zeal
   for the most perfect purity which led that great Saint so to act, and
   although such zeal is a great virtue, still it was a virtue which
   required checking. And so God Himself checked it in a vision, by which
   He filled S. Bernard with so gentle, tender, and loving a spirit, that
   he was altogether changed, blaming himself heavily for having been so
   strict and so severe, and becoming so kindly and indulgent, that he
   made himself all things to all men in order to win all.

   S. Jerome tells us that his beloved daughter, S. Paula, was not only
   extreme, but obstinate in practising bodily mortifications, and
   refusing to yield to the advice given her upon that head by her Bishop,
   S. Epiphanius; and furthermore, she gave way so excessively to her
   grief at the death of those she loved as to peril her own life.
   Whereupon S. Jerome says: "It will be said that I am accusing this
   saintly woman rather than praising her, but I affirm before Jesus, Whom
   she served, and Whom I seek to serve, that I am not saying what is
   untrue on one side or the other, but simply describing her as one
   Christian another; that is to say, I am writing her history, not her
   panegyric, and her faults are the virtues of others." He means to say
   that the defects and faults of S. Paula would have been looked upon as
   virtues in a less perfect soul; and indeed there are actions which we
   must count as imperfections in the perfect, which yet would be highly
   esteemed in the imperfect. When at the end of a sickness the invalid's
   legs swell, it is a good sign, indicating that natural strength is
   returning, and throwing off foul humours; but it would be a bad sign in
   one not avowedly sick, as showing that nature was too feeble to
   disperse or absorb those humours.

   So, my child, we must think well of those whom we see practising
   virtues, although imperfectly, since the Saints have done the like; but
   as to ourselves we must give heed to practise them, not only
   diligently, but discreetly, and to this end we shall do well strictly
   to follow the Wise Man's counsel, [56] and not trust in our own wisdom,
   but lean on those whom God has given as our guides. And here I must say
   a few words concerning certain things which some reckon as virtues,
   although they are nothing of the sort--I mean ecstasies, trances,
   rhapsodies, extraordinary transformations, and the like, which are
   dwelt on in some books, and which promise to raise the soul to a purely
   intellectual contemplation, an altogether supernatural mental altitude,
   and a life of pre-eminent excellence. But I would have you see, my
   child, that these perfections are not virtues, they are rather rewards
   which God gives to virtues, or perhaps, more correctly speaking, tokens
   of the joys of everlasting life, occasionally granted to men in order
   to kindle in them a desire for the fulness of joy which is only to be
   found in Paradise. But we must not aspire to such graces, which are in
   nowise necessary to us in order to love and serve God, our only lawful
   ambition. Indeed, for the most part, these graces are not to be
   acquired by labour or industry, and that because they are rather
   passions than actions, which we may receive, but cannot create.
   Moreover, our business only is to become good, devout people, pious men
   and women; and all our efforts must be to that end. If it should please
   God further to endow us with angelic perfection, we should then be
   prepared to become good angels; but meanwhile let us practise, in all
   simplicity, humility and devotion, those lowly virtues to the
   attainment of which our Lord has bidden us labour,--I mean patience,
   cheerfulness, self-mortification, humility, obedience, poverty,
   chastity, kindness to our neighbour, forbearance towards his failings,
   diligence, and a holy fervour. Let us willingly resign the higher
   eminences to lofty souls. We are not worthy to take so high a rank in
   God's service; let us be content to be as scullions, porters,
   insignificant attendants in His household, leaving it to Him if He
   should hereafter see fit to call us to His own council chamber. Of a
   truth, my child, the King of Glory does not reward His servants
   according to the dignity of their office, but according to the humility
   and love with which they have exercised it. While Saul was seeking his
   father's asses, he found the kingdom of Israel: [57] Rebecca watering
   Abraham's camels, became his son's wife: [58] Ruth gleaning after Boaz'
   reapers, and lying down at his feet, was raised up to become his bride.
   [59] Those who pretend to such great and extraordinary graces are very
   liable to delusions and mistakes, so that sometimes it turns out that
   people who aspire to be angels are not ordinarily good men, and that
   their goodness lies more in high-flown words than in heart and deed.
   But we must beware of despising or presumptuously condemning anything.
   Only, while thanking God for the pre-eminence of others, let us abide
   contentedly in our own lower but safer path,--a path of less
   distinction, but more suitable to our lowliness, resting satisfied that
   if we walk steadily and faithfully therein, God will lift us up to
   greater things.

CHAPTER III. On Patience.

   "YE have need of patience, that, after ye have done the Will of God, ye
   might receive the promise," says Saint Paul; [60] and the Saviour said,
   "In your patience possess ye your souls." [61] The greatest happiness
   of any one is "to possess his soul;" and the more perfect our patience,
   the more fully we do so possess our souls. Call often to mind that our
   Saviour redeemed us by bearing and suffering, and in like manner we
   must seek our own salvation amid sufferings and afflictions; bearing
   insults, contradictions and troubles with all the gentleness we can
   possibly command. Do not limit your patience to this or that kind of
   trial, but extend it universally to whatever God may send, or allow to
   befall you. Some people will only bear patiently with trials which
   carry their own salve of dignity,--such as being wounded in battle,
   becoming a prisoner of war, being ill-used for the sake of their
   religion, being impoverished by some strife out of which they came
   triumphant. Now these persons do not love tribulation, but only the
   honour which attends it. A really patient servant of God is as ready to
   bear inglorious troubles as those which are honourable. A brave man can
   easily bear with contempt, slander and false accusation from an evil
   world; but to bear such injustice at the hands of good men, of friends
   and relations, is a great test of patience. I have a greater respect
   for the gentleness with which the great S. Charles Borromeo long
   endured the public reproaches which a celebrated preacher of a reformed
   Order used to pour out upon him, than for all the other attacks he bore
   with. For, just as the sting of a bee hurts far more than that of a
   fly, so the injuries or contradictions we endure from good people are
   much harder to bear than any others. But it is a thing which very often
   happens, and sometimes two worthy men, who are both highly
   well-intentioned after their own fashion, annoy and even persecute one
   another grievously.

   Be patient, not only with respect to the main trials which beset you,
   but also under the accidental and accessory annoyances which arise out
   of them. We often find people who imagine themselves ready to accept a
   trial in itself who are impatient of its consequences. We hear one man
   say, "I should not mind poverty, were it not that I am unable to bring
   up my children and receive my friends as handsomely as I desire." And
   another says, "I should not mind, were it not that the world will
   suppose it is my own fault;" while another would patiently bear to be
   the subject of slander provided nobody believed it. Others, again,
   accept one side of a trouble but fret against the rest--as, for
   instance, believing themselves to be patient under sickness, only
   fretting against their inability to obtain the best advice, or at the
   inconvenience they are to their friends. But, dear child, be sure that
   we must patiently accept, not sickness only, but such sickness as God
   chooses to send, in the place, among the people, and subject to the
   circumstances which He ordains;--and so with all other troubles. If any
   trouble comes upon you, use the remedies with which God supplies you.
   Not to do this is to tempt Him; but having done so, wait whatever
   result He wills with perfect resignation. If He pleases to let the evil
   be remedied, thank Him humbly; but if it be His will that the evil grow
   greater than the remedies, patiently bless His Holy Name.

   Follow Saint Gregory's advice: When you are justly blamed for some
   fault you have committed, humble yourself deeply, and confess that you
   deserve the blame. If the accusation be false, defend yourself quietly,
   denying the fact; this is but due respect for truth and your
   neighbour's edification. But if after you have made your true and
   legitimate defence you are still accused, do not be troubled, and do
   not try to press your defence--you have had due respect for truth, have
   the same now for humility. By acting thus you will not infringe either
   a due care for your good name, or the affection you are bound to
   entertain for peace, humility and gentleness of heart.

   Complain as little as possible of your wrongs, for as a general rule
   you may be sure that complaining is sin; [62] the rather that self-love
   always magnifies our injuries: above all, do not complain to people who
   are easily angered and excited. If it is needful to complain to some
   one, either as seeking a remedy for your injury, or in order to soothe
   your mind, let it be to some calm, gentle spirit, greatly filled with
   the Love of God; for otherwise, instead of relieving your heart, your
   confidants will only provoke it to still greater disturbance; instead
   of taking out the thorn which pricks you, they will drive it further
   into your foot.

   Some people when they are ill, or in trouble, or injured by any one,
   restrain their complaints, because they think (and that rightly) that
   to murmur betokens great weakness or a narrow mind; but nevertheless,
   they exceedingly desire and maneuvre to make others pity them, desiring
   to be considered as suffering with patience and courage. Now this is a
   kind of patience certainly, but it is a spurious patience, which in
   reality is neither more nor less than a very refined, very subtle form
   of ambition and vanity. To them we may apply the Apostle's words, "He
   hath whereof to glory, but not before God." [63] A really patient man
   neither complains nor seeks to be pitied; he will speak simply and
   truly of his trouble, without exaggerating its weight or bemoaning
   himself; if others pity him, he will accept their compassion patiently,
   unless they pity him for some ill he is not enduring, in which case he
   will say so with meekness, and abide in patience and truthfulness,
   combating his grief and not complaining of it.

   As to the trials which you will encounter in devotion (and they are
   certain to arise), bear in mind our dear Lord's words: "A woman, when
   she is in travail, hath sorrow, because her hour is come; but as soon
   as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish,
   for joy that a child is born into the world." [64] You, too, have
   conceived in your soul the most gracious of children, even Jesus
   Christ, and before He can be brought forth you must inevitably travail
   with pain; but be of good cheer, for when these pangs are over, you
   will possess an abiding joy, having brought such a man into the world.
   And He will be really born for you, when He is perfected in your heart
   by love, and in your actions by imitating His life.

   When you are sick, offer all your pains and weakness to our Dear Lord,
   and ask Him to unite them to the sufferings which He bore for you. Obey
   your physician, and take all medicines, remedies and nourishment, for
   the Love of God, remembering the vinegar and gall He tasted for love of
   us; desire your recovery that you may serve Him; do not shrink from
   languor and weakness out of obedience to Him, and be ready to die if He
   wills it, to His Glory, and that you may enter into His Presence.

   Bear in mind that the bee while making its honey lives upon a bitter
   food: and in like manner we can never make acts of gentleness and
   patience, or gather the honey of the truest virtues, better than while
   eating the bread of bitterness, and enduring hardness. And just as the
   best honey is that made from thyme, a small and bitter herb, so that
   virtue which is practised amid bitterness and lowly sorrow is the best
   of all virtues.

   Gaze often inwardly upon Jesus Christ crucified, naked, blasphemed,
   falsely accused, forsaken, overwhelmed with every possible grief and
   sorrow, and remember that none of your sufferings can ever be compared
   to His, either in kind or degree, and that you can never suffer
   anything for Him worthy to be weighed against what He has borne for
   you.

   Consider the pains which martyrs have endured, and think how even now
   many people are bearing afflictions beyond all measure greater than
   yours, and say, "Of a truth my trouble is comfort, my torments are but
   roses as compared to those whose life is a continual death, without
   solace, or aid or consolation, borne down with a weight of grief
   tenfold greater than mine."

CHAPTER IV. On Greater Humility.

   ELISHA bade the poor widow "borrow vessels, even empty vessels not a
   few, and pour oil into all those vessels;" [65] and so in order to
   receive God's Grace in our hearts, they must be as empty vessels--not
   filled with self-esteem. The swallow with its sharp cry and keen glance
   has the power of frightening away birds of prey, and for that reason
   the dove prefers it to all other birds, and lives surely beside
   it;--even so humility drives Satan away, and cherishes the gifts and
   graces of the Holy Spirit within us, and for that reason all the
   Saints--and especially the King of Saints and His Blessed Mother--have
   always esteemed the grace of humility above all other virtues.

   We call that vainglory which men take to themselves, either for what is
   not in them, or which being in them is not their own, or which being in
   them and their own yet is not worthy of their self-satisfaction. For
   instance, noble birth, favour of great men, popular applause, all these
   are things nowise belonging to ourselves, but coming from our
   forefathers, or the opinion of others. Some people are proud and
   conceited because they ride a fine horse, wear a feather in their hat,
   and are expensively dressed, but who can fail to see their folly, or
   that if any one has reason to be proud over such things, it would be
   the horse, the bird, and the tailor! Or what can be more contemptible
   than to found one's credit on a horse, a plume, or a ruff? Others again
   pride themselves upon their dainty moustaches, their well-trimmed beard
   or curled hair, their white hands, or their dancing, singing and the
   like: but is it not a petty vanity which can seek to be esteemed for
   any such trivial and frivolous matters? Then again, some look for the
   world's respect and honour because they have acquired some smatterings
   of science, expecting all their neighbours to listen and yield to them,
   and such men we call pedants. Others make great capital of their
   personal beauty, and imagine that every one is lost in admiration of
   it; but all this is utterly vain, foolish and impertinent, and the
   glory men take to themselves for such matters must be called vain,
   childish and frivolous.

   You may test real worth as we test balm, which is tried by being
   distilled in water, and if it is precipitated to the bottom, it is
   known to be pure and precious. So if you want to know whether a man is
   really wise, learned, generous or noble, see if his life is moulded by
   humility, modesty and submission. If so, his gifts are genuine; but if
   they are only surface and showy, you may be sure that in proportion to
   their demonstrativeness so is their unreality. Those pearls which are
   formed amid tempest and storm have only an outward shell, and are
   hollow within; and so when a man's good qualities are fed by pride,
   vanity and boasting, they will soon have nothing save empty show,
   without sap, marrow or substance.

   Honour, rank and dignity are like the saffron, which never thrives so
   well as when trodden under foot. Beauty only attracts when it is free
   from any such aim. Self-conscious beauty loses its charm, and learning
   becomes a discredit and degenerates into pedantry, when we are puffed
   up by it.

   Those who are punctilious about rank, title or precedence, both lay
   themselves open to criticism and degradation, and also throw contempt
   on all such things; because an honour which is valuable when freely
   paid, is worthless when sought for or exacted. When the peacock opens
   his showy tail, he exhibits the ugliness of his body beneath; and many
   flowers which are beautiful while growing, wither directly we gather
   them. And just as men who inhale mandragora from afar as they pass,
   find it sweet, while those who breathe it closely are made faint and
   ill by the same, so honour may be pleasant to those who merely taste it
   as they pass, without seeking or craving for it, but it will become
   very dangerous and hurtful to such as take delight in and feed upon it.

   An active effort to acquire virtue is the first step towards goodness;
   but an active effort to acquire honour is the first step towards
   contempt and shame. A well-conditioned mind will not throw away its
   powers upon such sorry trifles as rank, position or outward forms--it
   has other things to do, and will leave all that to meaner minds. He who
   can find pearls will not stop to pick up shells; and so a man who aims
   at real goodness will not be keen about outward tokens of honour.
   Undoubtedly every one is justified in keeping his own place, and there
   is no want of humility in that so long as it is done simply and without
   contention. Just as our merchant-ships coming from Peru with gold and
   silver often bring apes and parrots likewise, because these cost but
   little and do not add to the weight of a cargo, so good men seeking to
   grow in grace can take their natural rank and position, so long as they
   are not engrossed by such things, and do not involve themselves in
   anxiety, contention or ill-will on their account. I am not speaking
   here of those whose position is public, or even of certain special
   private persons whose dignity may be important. In all such cases each
   man must move in his own sphere, with prudence and discretion, together
   with charity and courtesy.

CHAPTER V. On Interior Humility.

   TO you however, my daughter, I would teach a deeper humility, for that
   of which I have been speaking is almost more truly to be called worldly
   wisdom than humility. There are some persons who dare not or will not
   think about the graces with which God has endowed them, fearing lest
   they should become self-complacent and vain-glorious; but they are
   quite wrong. For if, as the Angelic Doctor says, the real way of
   attaining to the Love of God is by a careful consideration of all His
   benefits given to us, then the better we realise these the more we
   shall love Him; and inasmuch as individual gifts are more acceptable
   than general gifts, so they ought to be more specially dwelt upon. Of a
   truth, nothing so tends to humble us before the Mercy of God as the
   multitude of His gifts to us; just as nothing so tends to humble us
   before His Justice as the multitude of our misdeeds. Let us consider
   what He has done for us, and what we have done contrary to His Will,
   and as we review our sins in detail, so let us review His Grace in the
   same. There is no fear that a perception of what He has given you will
   puff you up, so long as you keep steadily in mind that whatever is good
   in you is not of yourself. Do mules cease to be clumsy, stinking beasts
   because they are used to carry the dainty treasures and perfumes of a
   prince? "What hast thou that thou didst not receive? Now, if thou didst
   receive it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?" [66]
   On the contrary, a lively appreciation of the grace given to you should
   make you humble, for appreciation begets gratitude. But if, when
   realising the gifts God has given you, any vanity should beset you, the
   infallible remedy is to turn to the thought of all our ingratitude,
   imperfection, and weakness. Any one who will calmly consider what he
   has done without God, cannot fail to realise that what he does with God
   is no merit of his own; and so we may rejoice in that which is good in
   us, and take pleasure in the fact, but we shall give all the glory to
   God Alone, Who Alone is its Author.

   It was in this spirit that the Blessed Virgin confessed that God had
   done "great things" to her; [67] only that she might humble herself and
   exalt Him. "My soul doth magnify the Lord," she said, by reason of the
   gifts He had given her.

   We are very apt to speak of ourselves as nought, as weakness itself, as
   the offscouring of the earth; but we should be very much vexed to be
   taken at our word and generally considered what we call ourselves. On
   the contrary, we often make-believe to run away and hide ourselves,
   merely to be followed and sought out; we pretend to take the lowest
   place, with the full intention of being honourably called to come up
   higher. But true humility does not affect to be humble, and is not
   given to make a display in lowly words. It seeks not only to conceal
   other virtues, but above all it seeks and desires to conceal itself;
   and if it were lawful to tell lies, or feign or give scandal, humility
   would perhaps sometimes affect a cloak of pride in order to hide itself
   utterly. Take my advice, my daughter, and either use no professions of
   humility, or else use them with a real mind corresponding to your
   outward expressions; never cast down your eyes without humbling your
   heart; and do not pretend to wish to be last and least, unless you
   really and sincerely mean it. I would make this so general a rule as to
   have no exception; only courtesy sometimes requires us to put forward
   those who obviously would not put themselves forward, but this is not
   deceitful or mock humility; and so with respect to certain expressions
   of regard which do not seem strictly true, but which are not dishonest,
   because the speaker really intends to give honour and respect to him to
   whom they are addressed; and even though the actual words may be
   somewhat excessive, there is no harm in them if they are the ordinary
   forms of society, though truly I wish that all our expressions were as
   nearly as possible regulated by real heart feeling in all truthfulness
   and simplicity. A really humble man would rather that some one else
   called him worthless and good-for-nothing, than say so of himself; at
   all events, if such things are said, he does not contradict them, but
   acquiesces contentedly, for it is his own opinion. We meet people who
   tell us that they leave mental prayer to those who are more perfect,
   not feeling themselves worthy of it; that they dare not communicate
   frequently, because they do not feel fit to do so; that they fear to
   bring discredit on religion if they profess it, through their weakness
   and frailty; while others decline to use their talents in the service
   of God and their neighbour, because, forsooth, they know their
   weakness, and are afraid of becoming proud if they do any good
   thing,--lest while helping others they might destroy themselves. But
   all this is unreal, and not merely a spurious but a vicious humility,
   which tacitly and secretly condemns God's gifts, and makes a pretext of
   lowliness while really exalting self-love, self-sufficiency, indolence,
   and evil tempers. "Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God; ask it either
   in the depth or in the height above." [68] So spake the prophet to King
   Ahaz; but he answered, "I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord."
   Unhappy man! he affects to show exceeding reverence to God, and under a
   pretence of humility refuses to seek the grace offered by the Divine
   Goodness. Could he not see that when God wills to grant us a favour, it
   is mere pride to reject it, that God's gifts must needs be accepted,
   and that true humility lies in obedience and the most literal
   compliance with His Will! Well then, God's Will is that we should be
   perfect, uniting ourselves to Him, and imitating Him to the utmost of
   our powers. The proud man who trusts in himself may well undertake
   nothing, but the humble man is all the braver that he knows his own
   helplessness, and his courage waxes in proportion to his low opinion of
   himself, because all his trust is in God, Who delights to show forth
   His Power in our weakness, His Mercy in our misery. The safest course
   is humbly and piously to venture upon whatever may be considered
   profitable for us by those who undertake our spiritual guidance.

   Nothing can be more foolish than to fancy we know that of which we are
   really ignorant; to affect knowledge while conscious that we are
   ignorant is intolerable vanity. For my part, I would rather not put
   forward that which I really do know, while on the other hand neither
   would I affect ignorance. When Charity requires it, you should readily
   and kindly impart to your neighbour not only that which is necessary
   for his instruction, but also what is profitable for his consolation.
   The same humility which conceals graces with a view to their
   preservation is ready to bring them forth at the bidding of Charity,
   with a view to their increase and perfection; therein reminding me of
   that tree in the Isles of Tylos, [69] which closes its beautiful
   carnation blossoms at night, only opening them to the rising sun, so
   that the natives say they go to sleep. Just so humility hides our
   earthly virtues and perfections, only expanding them at the call of
   Charity, which is not an earthly, but a heavenly, not a mere moral, but
   a divine virtue; the true sun of all virtues, which should all be ruled
   by it, so that any humility which controverts charity is unquestionably
   false.

   I would not affect either folly or wisdom; for just as humility deters
   me from pretending to be wise, so simplicity and straightforwardness
   deter me from pretending to be foolish; and just as vanity is opposed
   to humility, so all affectation and pretence are opposed to honesty and
   simplicity. If certain eminent servants of God have feigned folly in
   order to be despised by the world, we may marvel, but not imitate them;
   for they had special and extraordinary reasons for doing extraordinary
   things, and cannot be used as a rule for such as we are. When David
   [70] danced more than was customary before the Ark of the Covenant, it
   was not with the intention of affecting folly, but simply as expressing
   the unbounded and extraordinary gladness of his heart. Michal his wife
   reproached him with his actions as folly, but he did not mind being
   "vile and base in his own sight," but declared himself willing to be
   despised for God's Sake. And so, if you should be despised for acts of
   genuine devotion, humility will enable you to rejoice in so blessed a
   contempt, the cause of which does not lie with you.

CHAPTER VI. Humility makes us rejoice in our own Abjection.

   BUT, my daughter, I am going a step further, and I bid you everywhere
   and in everything to rejoice in your own abjection. Perhaps you will
   ask in reply what I mean by that. In Latin abjection means humility,
   and humility means abjection, so that when Our Lady says in the
   Magnificat that all generations shall call her blessed, because God
   hath regarded the low estate of His handmaiden, [71] she means that He
   has accepted her abjection and lowliness in order to fill her with
   graces and favours. Nevertheless, there is a difference between
   humility and abjection; for abjection is the poverty, vileness and
   littleness which exist in us, without our taking heed to them; but
   humility implies a real knowledge and voluntary recognition of that
   abjection. And the highest point of humility consists in not merely
   acknowledging one's abjection, but in taking pleasure therein, not from
   any want of breadth or courage, but to give the more glory to God's
   Divine Majesty, and to esteem one's neighbour more highly than one's
   self. This is what I would have you do; and to explain myself more
   clearly, let me tell you that the trials which afflict us are sometimes
   abject, sometimes honourable. NOW many people will accept the latter,
   but very few are willing to accept the former. Everybody respects and
   pities a pious hermit shivering in his worn-out garb; but let a poor
   gentleman or lady be in like case, and they are despised for it,--and
   so their poverty is abject. A religious receives a sharp rebuke from
   his superior meekly, or a child from his parent, and every one will
   call it obedience, mortification, wisdom; but let a knight or a lady
   accept the like from some one, albeit for the Love of God, and they
   will forthwith be accused of cowardice. This again is abject suffering.
   One person has a cancer in the arm, another in the face; the former
   only has the pain to bear, but the latter has also to endure all the
   disgust and repulsion caused by his disease; and this is abjection. And
   what I want to teach you is, that we should not merely rejoice in our
   trouble, which we do by means of patience, but we should also cherish
   the abjection, which is done by means of humility. Again, there are
   abject and honourable virtues; for the world generally despises
   patience, gentleness, simplicity, and even humility itself, while, on
   the contrary, it highly esteems prudence, valour, and liberality.
   Sometimes even there may be a like distinction drawn between acts of
   one and the same virtue--one being despised and the other respected.
   Thus almsgiving and forgiveness of injuries are both acts of charity,
   but while every one esteems the first, the world looks down upon the
   last. A young man or a girl who refuses to join in the excesses of
   dress, amusement, or gossip of their circle, is laughed at and
   criticised, and their self-restraint is called affectation or bigotry.
   Well, to rejoice in that is to rejoice in abjection. Or, to take
   another shape of the same thing. We are employed in visiting the
   sick--if I am sent to the most wretched cases, it is an abjection in
   the world's sight, and consequently I like it. If I am sent to those of
   a better class, it is an interior abjection, for there is less grace
   and merit in the work, and so I can accept that abjection. If one has a
   fall in the street, there is the ridiculous part of it to be borne, as
   well as the possible pain; and this is an abjection we must accept.
   There are even some faults, in which there is no harm beyond their
   abjection, and although humility does not require us to commit them
   intentionally, it does require of us not to be disturbed at having
   committed them. I mean certain foolish acts, incivilities, and
   inadvertencies, which we ought to avoid as far as may be out of
   civility and decorum, but of which, if accidentally committed, we ought
   to accept the abjection heartily, out of humility. To go further
   still,--if in anger or excitement I have been led to use unseemly
   words, offending God and my neighbour thereby, I will repent heartily,
   and be very grieved for the offence, which I must try to repair to the
   utmost; but meanwhile I will accept the abjection and disgrace which
   will ensue, and were it possible to separate the two things, I ought
   earnestly to reject the sin, while I retained the abjection readily.

   But while we rejoice in the abjection, we must nevertheless use all due
   and lawful means to remedy the evil whence it springs, especially when
   that evil is serious. Thus, if I have an abject disease in my face, I
   should endeavour to get it cured, although I do not wish to obliterate
   the abjection it has caused me. If I have done something awkward which
   hurts no one, I will not make excuses, because, although it was a
   failing, my own abjection is the only result; but if I have given
   offence or scandal through my carelessness or folly, I am bound to try
   and remedy it by a sincere apology. There are occasions when charity
   requires us not to acquiesce in abjection, but in such a case one ought
   the more to take it inwardly to heart for one's private edification.

   Perhaps you will ask what are the most profitable forms of abjection.
   Unquestionably, those most helpful to our own souls, and most
   acceptable to God, are such as come accidentally, or in the natural
   course of events, because we have not chosen them ourselves, but simply
   accepted God's choice, which is always to be preferred to ours. But if
   we are constrained to choose, the greatest abjections are best; and the
   greatest is whatever is most contrary to one's individual inclination,
   so long as it is in conformity with one's vocation; for of a truth our
   self-will and self-pleasing mars many graces. Who can teach any of us
   truly to say with David, "I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of
   my God, than to dwell in the tents of ungodliness"? [72] None, dear
   child, save He Who lived and died the scorn of men, and the outcast of
   the people, in order that we might be raised up. I have said things
   here which must seem very hard to contemplate, but, believe me, they
   will become sweet as honey when you try to put them in practice.

CHAPTER VII. How to combine due care for a Good Reputation with Humility.

   PRAISE, honour, and glory are not bestowed on men for ordinary, but for
   extraordinary virtue. By praise we intend to lead men to appreciate the
   excellence of certain individuals; giving them honour is the expression
   of our own esteem for them; and I should say that glory is the
   combination of praise and honour from many persons. If praise and
   honour are like precious stones, glory is as an enamel thereof. Now, as
   humility forbids us to aim at excelling or being preferred to others,
   it likewise forbids us to aim at praise, honour, and glory; but it
   allows us to give heed, as the Wise Man says, to our good name, and
   that because a good name does not imply any one particular excellence,
   but a general straightforward integrity of purpose, which we may
   recognise in ourselves, and desire to be known as possessing, without
   any breach of humility. Humility might make us indifferent even to a
   good reputation, were it not for charity's sake; but seeing that it is
   a groundwork of society, and without it we are not merely useless but
   positively harmful to the world, because of the scandal given by such a
   deficiency, therefore charity requires, and humility allows, us to
   desire and to maintain a good reputation with care.

   Moreover, just as the leaves of a tree are valuable, not merely for
   beauty's sake, but also as a shelter to the tender fruit, so a good
   reputation, if not in itself very important, is still very useful, not
   only as an embellishment of life, but as a protection to our virtues,
   especially to those which are weakly. The necessity for acting up to
   our reputation, and being what we are thought to be, brings a strong
   though kindly motive power to bear upon a generous disposition. Let us
   foster all our virtues, my daughter, because they are pleasing to God,
   the Chief Aim of all we do. But just as when men preserve fruits, they
   do not only conserve them, but put them into suitable vessels, so while
   Divine Love is the main thing which keeps us in the ways of holiness,
   we may also find help from the effects of a good reputation. But it
   will not do to be over-eager or fanciful about it. Those who are so
   very sensitive about their reputation are like people who are
   perpetually physicking themselves for every carnal ailment; they mean
   to preserve their health, but practically they destroy it; and those
   who are so very fastidious over their good name are apt to lose it
   entirely, for they become fanciful, fretful, and disagreeable,
   provoking ill-natured remarks.

   As a rule, indifference to insult and slander is a much more effectual
   remedy than resentment, wrath, and vengeance. Slander melts away
   beneath contempt, but indignation seems a sort of acknowledgment of its
   truth. Crocodiles never meddle with any but those who are afraid of
   them, and slander only persists in attacking people who are disturbed
   by it.

   An excessive fear of losing reputation indicates mistrust as to its
   foundations, which are to be found in a good and true life. Those towns
   where the bridges are built of wood are very uneasy whenever a sign of
   flood appears, but they who possess stone bridges are not anxious
   unless some very unusual storm appears. And so a soul built up on solid
   Christian foundations can afford to despise the outpour of slanderous
   tongues, but those who know themselves to be weak are for ever
   disturbed and uneasy. Be sure, my daughter, that he who seeks to be
   well thought of by everybody will be esteemed by nobody, and those
   people deserve to be despised who are anxious to be highly esteemed by
   ungodly, unworthy men.

   Reputation, after all, is but a signboard giving notice where virtue
   dwells, and virtue itself is always and everywhere preferable.
   Therefore, if it is said that you are a hypocrite because you are
   professedly devout, or if you are called a coward because you have
   forgiven an insult, despise all such accusations. Such judgments are
   the utterances of foolish men, and you must not give up what is right,
   even though your reputation suffer, for fruit is better than foliage,
   that is to say, an inward and spiritual gain is worth all external
   gains. We may take a jealous care of our reputation, but not idolise
   it; and while we desire not to displease good men, neither should we
   seek to please those that are evil. A man's natural adornment is his
   beard, and a woman's her hair; if either be torn out they may never
   grow again, but if only shaven or shorn, they will grow all the
   thicker; and in like manner, if our reputation be shorn or even shaven
   by slanderous tongues (of which David says, that "with lies they cut
   like a sharp razor " [73] ), there is no need to be disturbed, it will
   soon spring again, if not brighter, at all events more substantial. But
   if it be lost through our own vices or meanness or evil living, it will
   not be easily restored, because its roots are plucked up. And the root
   of a good name is to be found in virtue and honesty, which will always
   cause it to spring up afresh, however it may be assaulted. If your good
   name suffers from some empty pursuit, some useless habit, some unworthy
   friendship, they must be renounced, for a good name is worth more than
   any such idle indulgence; but if you are blamed or slandered for pious
   practices, earnestness in devotion, or whatever tends to win eternal
   life, then let your slanderers have their way, like dogs that bay at
   the moon! Be sure that, if they should succeed in rousing any evil
   impression against you (clipping the beard of your reputation, as it
   were), your good name will soon revive, and the razor of slander will
   strengthen your honour, just as the pruning-knife strengthens the vine
   and causes it to bring forth more abundant fruit. Let us keep Jesus
   Christ Crucified always before our eyes; let us go on trustfully and
   simply, but with discretion and wisdom, in His Service, and He will
   take care of our reputation; if He permits us to lose it, it will only
   be to give us better things, and to train us in a holy humility, one
   ounce of which is worth more than a thousand pounds of honour. If we
   are unjustly blamed, let us quietly meet calumny with truth; if calumny
   perseveres, let us persevere in humility; there is no surer shelter for
   our reputation or our soul than the Hand of God. Let us serve Him in
   good report or evil report alike, with S. Paul; [74] so that we may cry
   out with David, "For Thy Sake have I suffered reproof, shame hath
   covered my face." [75]

   Of course certain crimes, so grievous that no one who can justify
   himself should remain silent, must be excepted; as, too, certain
   persons whose reputation closely affects the edification of others. In
   this case all theologians say that it is right quietly to seek
   reparation.

CHAPTER VIII. Gentleness towards others and Remedies against Anger.

   THE holy Chrism, used by the Church according to apostolic tradition,
   is made of olive oil mingled with balm, which, among other things, are
   emblematic of two virtues very specially conspicuous in our Dear Lord
   Himself, and which He has specially commended to us, as though they,
   above all things, drew us to Him and taught us to imitate Him: "Take My
   yoke upon you, and learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart." [76]
   Humility makes our lives acceptable to God, meekness makes us
   acceptable to men. Balm, as I said before, sinking to the bottom of all
   liquids, is a figure of humility; and oil, floating as it does to the
   top, is a figure of gentleness and cheerfulness, rising above all
   things, and excelling all things, the very flower of Love, which, so
   says S. Bernard, comes to perfection when it is not merely patient, but
   gentle and cheerful. Give heed, then, daughter, that you keep this
   mystic chrism of gentleness and humility in your heart, for it is a
   favourite device of the Enemy to make people content with a fair
   outside semblance of these graces, not examining their inner hearts,
   and so fancying themselves to be gentle and humble while they are far
   otherwise. And this is easily perceived, because, in spite of their
   ostentatious gentleness and humility, they are stirred up with pride
   and anger by the smallest wrong or contradiction. There is a popular
   belief that those who take the antidote commonly called "Saint Paul's
   gift," [77] do not suffer from the viper's bite, provided, that is,
   that the remedy be pure; and even so true gentleness and humility will
   avert the burning and swelling which contradiction is apt to excite in
   our hearts. If, when stung by slander or ill-nature, we wax proud and
   swell with anger, it is a proof that our gentleness and humility are
   unreal, and mere artificial show. When the Patriarch Joseph sent his
   brethren back from Egypt to his father's house, he only gave them one
   counsel, "See that ye fall not out by the way." [78] And so, my child,
   say I to you. This miserable life is but the road to a blessed life; do
   not let us fall out by the way one with another; let us go on with the
   company of our brethren gently, peacefully, and kindly. Most
   emphatically I say it, If possible, fall out with no one, and on no
   pretext whatever suffer your heart to admit anger and passion. S. James
   says, plainly and unreservedly, that "the wrath of man worketh not the
   righteousness of God." [79] Of course it is a duty to resist evil and
   to repress the faults of those for whom we are responsible, steadily
   and firmly, but gently and quietly. Nothing so stills the elephant when
   enraged as the sight of a lamb; nor does anything break the force of a
   cannon ball so well as wool. Correction given in anger, however
   tempered by reason, never has so much effect as that which is given
   altogether without anger; for the reasonable soul being naturally
   subject to reason, it is a mere tyranny which subjects it to passion,
   and whereinsoever reason is led by passion it becomes odious, and its
   just rule obnoxious. When a monarch visits a country peaceably the
   people are gratified and flattered; but if the king has to take his
   armies through the land, even on behalf of the public welfare, his
   visit is sure to be unwelcome and harmful, because, however strictly
   military discipline may be enforced, there will always be some mischief
   done to the people. Just so when reason prevails, and administers
   reproof, correction, and punishment in a calm spirit, although it be
   strict, every one approves and is content; but if reason be hindered by
   anger and vexation (which Saint Augustine calls her soldiers) there
   will be more fear than love, and reason itself will be despised and
   resisted. The same Saint Augustine, writing to Profuturus, says that it
   is better to refuse entrance to any even the least semblance of anger,
   however just; and that because once entered in, it is hard to be got
   rid of, and what was but a little mote soon waxes into a great beam.
   For if anger tarries till night, and the sun goes down upon our wrath
   (a thing expressly forbidden by the Apostle [80] ), there is no longer
   any way of getting rid of it; it feeds upon endless false fancies; for
   no angry man ever yet but thought his anger just.

   Depend upon it, it is better to learn how to live without being angry
   than to imagine one can moderate and control anger lawfully; and if
   through weakness and frailty one is overtaken by it, it is far better
   to put it away forcibly than to parley with it; for give anger ever so
   little way, and it will become master, like the serpent, who easily
   works in its body wherever it can once introduce its head. You will ask
   how to put away anger. My child, when you feel its first movements,
   collect yourself gently and seriously, not hastily or with impetuosity.
   Sometimes in a law court the officials who enforce quiet make more
   noise than those they affect to hush; and so, if you are impetuous in
   restraining your temper, you will throw your heart into worse confusion
   than before, and, amid the excitement, it will lose all self-control.

   Having thus gently exerted yourself, follow the advice which the aged
   S. Augustine gave to a younger Bishop, Auxilius. "Do," said he, "what a
   man should do." If you are like the Psalmist, ready to cry out, "Mine
   eye is consumed for very anger," [81] go on to say, "Have mercy upon
   me, O Lord;" so that God may stretch forth His Right Hand and control
   your wrath. I mean, that when we feel stirred with anger, we ought to
   call upon God for help, like the Apostles, when they were tossed about
   with wind and storm, and He is sure to say, "Peace, be still." But even
   here I would again warn you, that your very prayers against the angry
   feelings which urge you should be gentle, calm, and without vehemence.
   Remember this rule in whatever remedies against anger you may seek.
   Further, directly you are conscious of an angry act, atone for the
   fault by some speedy act of meekness towards the person who excited
   your anger. It is a sovereign cure for untruthfulness to unsay what you
   have falsely said at once on detecting yourself in falsehood; and so,
   too, it is a good remedy for anger to make immediate amends by some
   opposite act of meekness. There is an old saying, that fresh wounds are
   soonest closed.

   Moreover, when there is nothing to stir your wrath, lay up a store of
   meekness and kindliness, speaking and acting in things great and small
   as gently as possible. Remember that the Bride of the Canticles is
   described as not merely dropping honey, and milk also, from her lips,
   but as having it "under her tongue;" [82] that is to say, in her heart.
   So we must not only speak gently to our neighbour, but we must be
   filled, heart and soul, with gentleness; and we must not merely seek
   the sweetness of aromatic honey in courtesy and suavity with strangers,
   but also the sweetness of milk among those of our own household and our
   neighbours; a sweetness terribly lacking to some who are as angels
   abroad and devils at home!

CHAPTER IX. On Gentleness towards Ourselves.

   ONE important direction in which to exercise gentleness, is with
   respect to ourselves, never growing irritated with one's self or one's
   imperfections; for although it is but reasonable that we should be
   displeased and grieved at our own faults, yet ought we to guard against
   a bitter, angry, or peevish feeling about them. Many people fall into
   the error of being angry because they have been angry, vexed because
   they have given way to vexation, thus keeping up a chronic state of
   irritation, which adds to the evil of what is past, and prepares the
   way for a fresh fall on the first occasion. Moreover, all this anger
   and irritation against one's self fosters pride, and springs entirely
   from self-love, which is disturbed and fretted by its own imperfection.
   What we want is a quiet, steady, firm displeasure at our own faults. A
   judge gives sentence more effectually speaking deliberately and calmly
   than if he be impetuous and passionate (for in the latter case he
   punishes not so much the actual faults before him, but what they appear
   to him to be); and so we can chasten ourselves far better by a quiet
   stedfast repentance, than by eager hasty ways of penitence, which, in
   fact, are proportioned not by the weight of our faults, but according
   to our feelings and inclinations. Thus one man who specially aims at
   purity will be intensely vexed with himself at some very trifling fault
   against it, while he looks upon some gross slander of which he has been
   guilty as a mere laughing matter. On the other hand, another will
   torment himself painfully over some slight exaggeration, while he
   altogether overlooks some serious offence against purity; and so on
   with other things. All this arises solely because men do not judge
   themselves by the light of reason, but under the influence of passion.

   Believe me, my daughter, as a parent's tender affectionate remonstrance
   has far more weight with his child than anger and sternness, so, when
   we judge our own heart guilty, if we treat it gently, rather in a
   spirit of pity than anger, encouraging it to amendment, its repentance
   will be much deeper and more lasting than if stirred up in vehemence
   and wrath.

   For instance:--Let me suppose that I am specially seeking to conquer
   vanity, and yet that I have fallen conspicuously into that
   sin;--instead of taking myself to task as abominable and wretched, for
   breaking so many resolutions, calling myself unfit to lift up my eyes
   to Heaven, as disloyal, faithless, and the like, I would deal pitifully
   and quietly with myself. "Poor heart! so soon fallen again into the
   snare! Well now, rise up again bravely and fall no more. Seek God's
   Mercy, hope in Him, ask Him to keep you from falling again, and begin
   to tread the pathway of humility afresh. We must be more on our guard
   henceforth." Such a course will be the surest way to making a stedfast
   substantial resolution against the special fault, to which should be
   added any external means suitable, and the advice of one's director. If
   any one does not find this gentle dealing sufficient, let him use
   sterner self-rebuke and admonition, provided only, that whatever
   indignation he may rouse against himself, he finally works it all up to
   a tender loving trust in God, treading in the footsteps of that great
   penitent who cried out to his troubled soul: "Why art thou so vexed, O
   my soul, and why art thou so disquieted within me? O put thy trust in
   God, for I will yet thank Him, Which is the help of my countenance, and
   my God." [83]

   So then, when you have fallen, lift up your heart in quietness,
   humbling yourself deeply before God by reason of your frailty, without
   marvelling that you fell;--there is no cause to marvel because weakness
   is weak, or infirmity infirm. Heartily lament that you should have
   offended God, and begin anew to cultivate the lacking grace, with a
   very deep trust in His Mercy, and with a bold, brave heart.

CHAPTER X. We must attend to the Business of Life carefully, but without
Eagerness or Over-anxiety.

   THE care and diligence due to our ordinary business are very different
   from solicitude, anxiety and restlessness. The Angels care for our
   salvation and seek it diligently, but they are wholly free from anxiety
   and solicitude, for, whereas care and diligence naturally appertain to
   their love, anxiety would be wholly inconsistent with their happiness;
   for although care and diligence can go hand in hand with calmness and
   peace, those angelic properties could not unite with solicitude or
   anxiety, much less with over-eagerness.

   Therefore, my daughter, be careful and diligent in all your affairs;
   God, Who commits them to you, wills you to give them your best
   attention; but strive not to be anxious and solicitous, that is to say,
   do not set about your work with restlessness and excitement, and do not
   give way to bustle and eagerness in what you do;--every form of
   excitement affects both judgment and reason, and hinders a right
   performance of the very thing which excites us.

   Our Lord, rebuking Martha, said, "Thou art careful and troubled about
   many things." [84] If she had been simply careful, she would not have
   been troubled, but giving way to disquiet and anxiety, she grew eager
   and troubled, and for that our Lord reproved her. The rivers which flow
   gently through our plains bear barges of rich merchandise, and the
   gracious rains which fall softly on the land fertilise it to bear the
   fruits of the earth;--but when the rivers swell into torrents, they
   hinder commerce and devastate the country, and violent storms and
   tempests do the like. No work done with impetuosity and excitement was
   ever well done, and the old proverb, "Make haste slowly," is a good
   one, [85] Solomon says, "There is one that laboureth and taketh pains,
   and maketh haste, and is so much the more behind;" [86] we are always
   soon enough when we do well. The bumble bee makes far more noise and is
   more bustling than the honey bee, but it makes nought save wax--no
   honey; just so those who are restless and eager, or full of noisy
   solicitude, never do much or well. Flies harass us less by what they do
   than by reason of their multitude, and so great matters give us less
   disturbance than a multitude of small affairs. Accept the duties which
   come upon you quietly, and try to fulfil them methodically, one after
   another. If you attempt to do everything at once, or with confusion,
   you will only cumber yourself with your own exertions, and by dint of
   perplexing your mind you will probably be overwhelmed and accomplish
   nothing.

   In all your affairs lean solely on God's Providence, by means of which
   alone your plans can succeed. Meanwhile, on your part work on in quiet
   co-operation with Him, and then rest satisfied that if you have trusted
   entirely to Him you will always obtain such a measure of success as is
   most profitable for you, whether it seems so or not to your own
   individual judgment.

   Imitate a little child, whom one sees holding tight with one hand to
   its father, while with the other it gathers strawberries or
   blackberries from the wayside hedge. Even so, while you gather and use
   this world's goods with one hand, always let the other be fast in your
   Heavenly Father's Hand, and look round from time to time to make sure
   that He is satisfied with what you are doing, at home or abroad. Beware
   of letting go, under the idea of making or receiving more--if He
   forsakes you, you will fall to the ground at the first step. When your
   ordinary work or business is not specially engrossing, let your heart
   be fixed more on God than on it; and if the work be such as to require
   your undivided attention, then pause from time to time and look to God,
   even as navigators who make for the haven they would attain, by looking
   up at the heavens rather than down upon the deeps on which they sail.
   So doing, God will work with you, in you, and for you, and your work
   will be blessed.

CHAPTER XI. On Obedience.

   LOVE alone leads to perfection, but the three chief means for acquiring
   it are obedience, chastity, and poverty. Obedience is a consecration of
   the heart, chastity of the body, and poverty of all worldly goods to
   the Love and Service of God. These are the three members of the
   Spiritual Cross, and all three must be raised upon the fourth, which is
   humility. I am not going here to speak of these three virtues as solemn
   vows, which only concern religious, nor even as ordinary vows, although
   when sought under the shelter of a vow all virtues receive an enhanced
   grace and merit; but it is not necessary for perfection that they
   should be undertaken as vows, so long as they are practised diligently.
   The three vows solemnly taken put a man into the state of perfection,
   whereas a diligent observance thereof brings him to perfection. For,
   observe, there is a great difference between the state of perfection
   and perfection itself, inasmuch as all prelates and religious are in
   the former, although unfortunately it is too obvious that by no means
   all attain to the latter. Let us then endeavour to practise these three
   virtues, according to our several vocations, for although we are not
   thereby called to a state of perfection, we may attain through them to
   perfection itself, and of a truth we are all bound to practise them,
   although not all after the same manner.

   There are two kinds of obedience, one necessary, the other voluntary.
   The first includes a humble obedience to your ecclesiastical superiors,
   whether Pope, Bishop, Curate, or those commissioned by them. You are
   likewise bound to obey your civil superiors, king and magistrates; as
   also your domestic superiors, father, mother, master or mistress. Such
   obedience is called necessary, because no one can free himself from the
   duty of obeying these superiors, God having appointed them severally to
   bear rule over us. Therefore do you obey their commands as of right,
   but if you would be perfect, follow their counsels, and even their
   wishes as far as charity and prudence will allow: obey as to things
   acceptable; as when they bid you eat, or take recreation, for although
   there may be no great virtue in obedience in such a case, there is
   great harm in disobedience. Obey in things indifferent, as concerning
   questions of dress, coming and going, singing or keeping silence, for
   herein is a very laudable obedience. Obey in things hard, disagreeable
   and inconvenient, and therein lies a very perfect obedience. Moreover,
   obey quietly, without answering again, promptly, without delay,
   cheerfully, without reluctance; and, above all, render a loving
   obedience for His Sake Who became obedient even to the death of the
   Cross for our sake; Who, as Saint Bernard says, chose rather to resign
   His Life than His Obedience.

   If you would acquire a ready obedience to superiors, accustom yourself
   to yield to your equals, giving way to their opinions where nothing
   wrong is involved, without arguing or peevishness; and adapt yourself
   easily to the wishes of your inferiors as far as you reasonably can,
   and forbear the exercise of stern authority so long as they do well.

   It is a mistake for those who find it hard to pay a willing obedience
   to their natural superiors to suppose that if they were professed
   religious they would find it easy to obey.

   Voluntary obedience is such as we undertake by our own choice, and
   which is not imposed by others. Persons do not choose their own King or
   Bishop, or parents--often not even their husband; but most people
   choose their confessor or director. And whether a person takes a vow of
   obedience to him (as Saint Theresa, beyond her formal vow to the
   Superior of her Order, bound herself by a simple vow to obey Father
   Gratian), or without any vow they resolve to obey their chosen
   spiritual guide, all such obedience is voluntary, because it depends
   upon our own will.

   Obedience to lawful superiors is regulated by their official claims.
   Thus, in all public and legal matters, we are bound to obey our King;
   in ecclesiastical matters, our Bishop; in domestic matters, our father,
   master or husband; and in personal matters which concern the soul, our
   confessor or spiritual guide.

   Seek to be directed in your religious exercises by your spiritual
   father, because thereby they will have double grace and virtue;--that
   which is inherent in that they are devout, and that which comes by
   reason of the spirit of obedience in which they are performed. Blessed
   indeed are the obedient, for God will never permit them to go astray.

CHAPTER XII. On Purity.

   PURITY is the lily among virtues--by it men approach to the Angels.
   There is no beauty without purity, and human purity is chastity. We
   speak of the chaste as honest, and of the loss of purity as dishonour;
   purity is an intact thing, its converse is corruption. In a word, its
   special glory is in the spotless whiteness of soul and body.

   No unlawful pleasures are compatible with chastity; the pure heart is
   like the mother of pearl which admits no drop of water save that which
   comes from Heaven,--it is closed to every attraction save such as are
   sanctified by holy matrimony. Close your heart to every questionable
   tenderness or delight, guard against all that is unprofitable though it
   may be lawful, and strive to avoid unduly fixing your heart even on
   that which in itself is right and good.

   Every one has great need of this virtue: those living in widowhood need
   a brave chastity not only to forego present and future delights, but to
   resist the memories of the past, with which a happy married life
   naturally fills the imagination, softening and weakening the will.
   Saint Augustine lauds the purity of his beloved Alipius, who had
   altogether forgotten and despised the carnal pleasures in which his
   youth was passed. While fruits are whole, you may store them up
   securely, some in straw, some in sand or amid their own foliage, but
   once bruised there is no means of preserving them save with sugar or
   honey. Even so the purity which has never been tampered with may well
   be preserved to the end, but when once that has ceased to exist nothing
   can ensure its existence but the genuine devotion, which, as I have
   often said, is the very honey and sugar of the mind.

   The unmarried need a very simple sensitive purity, which will drive
   away all over-curious thoughts, and teach them to despise all merely
   sensual satisfactions. The young are apt to imagine that of which they
   are ignorant to be wondrous sweet, and as the foolish moth hovers
   around a light, and, persisting in coming too near, perishes in its
   inquisitive folly, so they perish through their unwise approach to
   forbidden pleasures. And married people need a watchful purity whereby
   to keep God ever before them, and to seek all earthly happiness and
   delight through Him Alone, ever remembering that He has sanctified the
   state of holy matrimony by making it the type of His own union with the
   Church.

   The Apostle says, "Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without
   which no man shall see the Lord:" [87] by which holiness he means
   purity. Of a truth, my daughter, without purity no one can ever see
   God; [88] nor can any hope to dwell in His tabernacle except he lead an
   uncorrupt life; [89] and our Blessed Lord Himself has promised the
   special blessing of beholding Him to those that are pure in heart.

CHAPTER XIII. How to maintain Purity.

   BE exceedingly quick in turning aside from the slightest thing leading
   to impurity, for it is an evil which approaches stealthily, and in
   which the very smallest beginnings are apt to grow rapidly. It is
   always easier to fly from such evils than to cure them.

   Human bodies are like glasses, which cannot come into collision without
   risk of breaking; or to fruits, which, however fresh and ripe, are
   damaged by pressure. Never permit any one to take any manner of foolish
   liberty with you, since, although there may be no evil intention, the
   perfectness of purity is injured thereby.

   Purity has its source in the heart, but it is in the body that its
   material results take shape, and therefore it may be forfeited both by
   the exterior senses and by the thoughts and desires of the heart. All
   lack of modesty in seeing, hearing, speaking, smelling, or touching, is
   impurity, especially when the heart takes pleasure therein. S. Paul
   says without any hesitation that impurity and uncleanness, or foolish
   and unseemly talking, are not to be "so much as named" [90] among
   Christians. The bee not only shuns all carrion, but abhors and flies
   far from the faintest smell proceeding therefrom. The Bride of the
   Canticles is represented with "hands dropping with myrrh." [91] a
   preservative against all corruption; her "lips are like a thread of
   scarlet," the type of modest words; [92] her eyes are "dove's eyes,"
   [93] clear and soft; her "nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh
   towards Damascus" [94] an incorruptible wood; her ears are hung with
   earrings of pure gold; [95] and even so the devout soul should be pure,
   honest and transparent in hand, lip, eye, ear, and the whole body.

   Remember that there are things which blemish perfect purity, without
   being in themselves downright acts of impurity. Anything which tends to
   lessen its intense sensitiveness, or to cast the slightest shadow over
   it, is of this nature; and all evil thoughts or foolish acts of levity
   or heedlessness are as steps towards the most direct breaches of the
   law of chastity. Avoid the society of persons who are wanting in
   purity, especially if they are bold, as indeed impure people always
   are. If a foul animal licks the sweet almond tree its fruit becomes
   bitter; and so a corrupt pestilential man can scarcely hold
   communication with others, whether men or women, without damaging their
   perfect purity--their very glance is venomous, and their breath
   blighting like the basilisk. On the other hand, seek out good and pure
   men, read and ponder holy things; for the Word of God is pure, and it
   will make those pure who study it: wherefore David likens it to gold
   and precious stones. [96] Always abide close to Jesus Christ Crucified,
   both spiritually in meditation and actually in Holy Communion; for as
   all those who sleep upon the plant called Agnus castus become pure and
   chaste, so, if you rest your heart upon Our Dear Lord, the Very Lamb,
   Pure and Immaculate, you will find that soon both heart and soul will
   be purified of all spot or stain.

CHAPTER XIV. On Poverty of Spirit amid Riches.

   "BLESSED are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of God;"
   [97] and if so, woe be to the rich in spirit, for theirs must be the
   bitterness of hell. By rich in spirit I mean him whose riches engross
   his mind, or whose mind is buried in his riches. He is poor in spirit
   whose heart is not filled with the love of riches, whose mind is not
   set upon them. The halcyon builds its nest like a ball, and leaving but
   one little aperture in the upper part, launches it on the sea, so
   secure and impenetrable, that the waves carry it along without any
   water getting in, and it floats on the sea, superior, so to say, to the
   waves. And this, my child, is what your heart should be--open only to
   heaven, impenetrable to riches and earthly treasures. If you have them,
   keep your heart from attaching itself to them; let it maintain a higher
   level, and amidst riches be as though you had none,--superior to them.
   Do not let that mind which is the likeness of God cleave to mere
   earthly goods; let it always be raised above them, not sunk in them.

   There is a wide difference between having poison and being poisoned.
   All apothecaries have poisons ready for special uses, but they are not
   consequently poisoned, because the poison is only in their shop, not in
   themselves; and so you may possess riches without being poisoned by
   them, so long as they are in your house or purse only, and not in your
   heart. It is the Christian's privilege to be rich in material things,
   and poor in attachment to them, thereby having the use of riches in
   this world and the merit of poverty in the next.

   Of a truth, my daughter, no one will ever own themselves to be
   avaricious;--every one denies this contemptible vice:--men excuse
   themselves on the plea of providing for their children, or plead the
   duty of prudent forethought:--they never have too much, there is always
   some good reason for accumulating more; and even the most avaricious of
   men not only do not own to being such, but sincerely believe that they
   are not; and that because avarice is as a strong fever which is all the
   less felt as it rages most fiercely. Moses saw that sacred fire which
   burnt the bush without consuming it, [98] but the profane fire of
   avarice acts precisely the other way,--it consumes the miser, but
   without burning, for, amid its most intense heat, he believes himself
   to be deliciously cool, and imagines his insatiable thirst to be merely
   natural and right.

   If you long earnestly, anxiously, and persistently after what you do
   not possess, it is all very well to say that you do not wish to get it
   unfairly, but you are all the time guilty of avarice. He who longs
   eagerly and anxiously to drink, though it may be water only, thereby
   indicates that he is feverish. I hardly think we can say that it is
   lawful to wish lawfully to possess that which is another's:--so doing
   we surely wish our own gain at the expense of that other? and he who
   possesses anything lawfully, surely has more right to possess it, than
   we to obtain it? Why should we desire that which is his? Even were the
   wish lawful, it is not charitable, for we should not like other men to
   desire what we possess, however lawfully. This was Ahab's sin when he
   sought to acquire Naboth's vineyard by lawful purchase, when Naboth
   lawfully desired to keep it himself;--he coveted it eagerly,
   continually, and anxiously, and so doing he displeased God. [99]

   Do not allow yourself to wish for that which is your neighbour's until
   he wishes to part with it,--then his wish will altogether justify
   yours,--and I am quite willing that you should add to your means and
   possessions, provided it be not merely with strict justice, but kindly
   and charitably done. If you cleave closely to your possessions, and are
   cumbered with them, setting your heart and thoughts upon them, and
   restlessly anxious lest you should suffer loss, then, believe me, you
   are still somewhat feverish;--for fever patients drink the water we
   give them with an eagerness and satisfaction not common to those who
   are well.

   It is not possible to take great pleasure in anything without becoming
   attached to it. If you lose property, and find yourself grievously
   afflicted at the loss, you may be sure that you were warmly attached to
   it;--there is no surer proof of affection for the thing lost than our
   sorrow at its loss.

   Therefore, do not fix your longings on anything which you do not
   possess; do not let your heart rest in that which you have; do not
   grieve overmuch at the losses which may happen to you;--and then you
   may reasonably believe that although rich in fact, you are not so in
   affection, but that you are poor in spirit, and therefore blessed, for
   the Kingdom of Heaven is yours.

CHAPTER XV. How to exercise real Poverty, although actually Rich.

   THE painter Parrhasius drew an ingenious and imaginative representation
   of the Athenians, ascribing sundry opposite qualities to them, calling
   them at once capricious, irascible, unjust, inconstant, courteous,
   merciful, compassionate, haughty, vain-glorious, humble, boastful, and
   cowardly;--and for my part, dear daughter, I would fain see united in
   your heart both riches and poverty, a great care and a great contempt
   for temporal things.

   Do you take much greater pains than is the wont of worldly men to make
   your riches useful and fruitful? Are not the gardeners of a prince more
   diligent in cultivating and beautifying the royal gardens than if they
   were their own? Wherefore? Surely because these gardens are the king's,
   to whom his gardeners would fain render an acceptable service. My
   child, our possessions are not ours,--God has given them to us to
   cultivate, that we may make them fruitful and profitable in His
   Service, and so doing we shall please Him. And this we must do more
   earnestly than worldly men, for they look carefully after their
   property out of self-love, and we must work for the love of God. Now
   self-love is a restless, anxious, over-eager love, and so the work done
   on its behalf is troubled, vexatious, and unsatisfactory;--whereas the
   love of God is calm, peaceful, and tranquil, and so the work done for
   its sake, even in worldly things, is gentle, trustful, and quiet. Let
   us take such a quiet care to preserve, and even when practicable to
   increase, our temporal goods, according to the duties of our
   position,--this is acceptable to God for His Love's Sake.

   But beware that you be not deceived by self-love, for sometimes it
   counterfeits the Love of God so cleverly that you may mistake one for
   the other. To avoid this, and to prevent a due care for your temporal
   interests from degenerating into avarice, it is needful often to
   practise a real poverty amid the riches with which God has endowed you.

   To this end always dispose of a part of your means by giving them
   heartily to the poor; you impoverish yourself by whatever you give
   away. It is true that God will restore it to you, not only in the next
   world, but in this, for nothing brings so much temporal prosperity as
   free almsgiving, but meanwhile, you are sensibly poorer for what you
   give. Truly that is a holy and rich poverty which results from
   almsgiving.

   Love the poor and poverty,--this love will make you truly poor, since,
   as Holy Scripture says, we become like to that we love. [100] Love
   makes lovers equal. "Who is weak and I am not weak?" [101] says St.
   Paul? He might have said, Who is poor and I am not poor? for it was
   love which made him like to those he loved; and so, if you love the
   poor, you will indeed share their poverty, and be poor like them.

   And if you love the poor, seek them out, take pleasure in bringing them
   to your home, and in going to theirs, talk freely with them, and be
   ready to meet them, whether in Church or elsewhere. Let your tongue be
   poor with them in converse, but let your hands be rich to distribute
   out of your abundance. Are you prepared to go yet further, my child?
   not to stop at being poor like the poor, but even poorer still? The
   servant is not so great as his lord; do you be the servant of the poor,
   tend their sickbed with your own hands, be their cook, their
   needlewoman. O my daughter, such servitude is more glorious than
   royalty! How touchingly S. Louis, one of the greatest of kings,
   fulfilled this duty; serving the poor in their own houses, and daily
   causing three to eat at his own table, often himself eating the remains
   of their food in his loving humility. In his frequent visits to the
   hospitals he would select those afflicted with the most loathsome
   diseases, ulcers, cancer, and the like; and these he would tend,
   kneeling down and bare-headed, beholding the Saviour of the world in
   them, and cherishing them with all the tenderness of a mother's love.
   Saint Elizabeth of Hungary used to mix freely with the poor, and liked
   to dress in their homely garments amid her gay ladies. Surely these
   royal personages were poor amid their riches and rich in poverty.

   Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. In
   the Day of Judgment the King of prince and peasant will say to them, "I
   was an hungred, and ye gave Me meat, I was naked, and ye clothed Me;
   come, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the
   world." [102]

   Everybody finds themselves sometimes deficient in what they need, and
   put to inconvenience. A guest whom we would fain receive honorably
   arrives, and we cannot entertain him as we would; we want our costly
   apparel in one place, and it all happens to be somewhere else: all the
   wine in our cellar suddenly turns sour: we find ourselves accidentally
   in some country place where everything is wanting, room, bed, food,
   attendance: in short, the richest people may easily be without
   something they want, and that is practically to suffer poverty. Accept
   such occurrences cheerfully, rejoice in them, bear them willingly.

   Again, if you are impoverished much or little by unforeseen events,
   such as storm, flood, fire, drought, theft, or lawsuit; then is the
   real time to practise poverty, accepting the loss quietly, and adapting
   yourself patiently to your altered circumstances. Esau and Jacob both
   came to their father with hairy hands, [103] but the hair on Jacob's
   hands did not grow from his skin, and could be torn off without pain;
   while that on Esau's hands being the natural growth of his skin, he
   would have cried out and resisted if any one had torn it off. So if our
   possessions are very close to our heart, and storm or thief tear them
   away, we shall break forth in impatient murmurs and lamentations. But
   if we only cleave to them with that solicitude which God wills us to
   have, and not with our whole heart, we shall see them rent away without
   losing our sense of calmness. This is just the difference between the
   clothing of men and beasts; the beast's clothing grows on its flesh,
   and man's is only laid on so that it may be laid aside at will.

CHAPTER XVI. How to possess a rich Spirit amid real Poverty.

   BUT if you are really poor, my daughter, for God's Sake be so in
   spirit; make a virtue of necessity, and turn that precious stone
   poverty to its true value. The brilliancy thereof is not perceived in
   this world, but nevertheless it is very great.

   Patience then! you are in good company. Our Dear Lord, Our Lady, the
   Apostles, numberless Saints, both men and women, were poor, and
   although they might have been rich, disdained to be so. How many great
   ones of this world have gone through many difficulties to seek holy
   poverty amid hospitals and cloisters! What pains they took to find it,
   let S. Alexis, S. Paula, S. Paulinus, S. Angela, and many another
   witness; whereas to you, my child, it has come unasked--you have met
   poverty without seeking it--do you then embrace it as the beloved
   friend of Jesus Christ, Who was born, lived and died in poverty, and
   cherished it all His Life.

   There are two great privileges connected with your poverty, through
   which you may acquire great merit. First, it is not your own choice,
   but God's Will alone, which has made you poor. Now, whatever we accept
   simply because it is God's Will is acceptable in His Sight, so long as
   we accept it heartily and out of love:--the less of self the more of
   God,--and a singlehearted acceptance of God's Will purifies any
   suffering very greatly.

   The second privilege is, that this poverty is so very poor. There is a
   be-praised, caressed poverty, so petted and cared for, that it can
   hardly be called poor like the despised, contemned, neglected poverty
   which also exists. Now, most secular poverty is of this last kind, for
   those who are involuntarily poor, and cannot help themselves, are not
   much thought of, and for that very reason their poverty is poorer than
   that of religious, although religious poverty has a very special and
   excellent grace, through the intention and the vow by which it is
   accepted.

   Do not complain then of your poverty, my daughter,--we only complain of
   that which is unwelcome, and if poverty is unwelcome to you, you are no
   longer poor in spirit. Do not fret under such assistance as is needful;
   therein lies one great grace of poverty. It were overambitious to aim
   at being poor without suffering any inconvenience, in other words, to
   have the credit of poverty and the convenience of riches.

   Do not be ashamed of being poor, or of asking alms. Receive what is
   given you with humility, and accept a refusal meekly. Frequently call
   to mind Our Lady's journey into Egypt with her Holy Child, and of all
   the poverty, contempt and suffering they endured. If you follow their
   example you will indeed be rich amid your poverty.

CHAPTER XVII. On Friendship: Evil and Frivolous Friendship.

   FOREMOST among the soul's affections is love. Love is the ruler of
   every motion of the heart; drawing all to itself, and making us like to
   that we love. Beware, then, my daughter, of harbouring any evil
   affection, or you too will become evil. And friendship is the most
   dangerous of all affections, because any other love may exist without
   much mental communication, but as friendship is founded thereon, it is
   hardly possible to be closely bound by its ties to any one without
   sharing in his qualities.

   All love is not friendship, for one may love without any return, and
   friendship implies mutual love. Further, those who are bound by such
   affection must be conscious that it is reciprocal,--otherwise there may
   be love but not friendship; and moreover, there must be something
   communicated between the friends as a solid foundation of friendship.

   Friendship varies according to these communications, and they vary
   according to that which people have to communicate. If men share false
   and vain things, their friendship will be false and vain; if that which
   is good and true, their friendship will be good and true, and the
   better that which is the staple of the bond, so much the better will
   the friendship be. That honey is best which is culled from the choicest
   flowers, and so friendship built upon the highest and purest
   intercommunion is the best. And just as a certain kind of honey brought
   from Pontus is poisonous, being made from aconite, so that those who
   eat it lose their senses, so the friendship which is based on unreal or
   evil grounds will itself be hollow and worthless.

   Mere sensual intercourse is not worthy of the name of friendship; and
   were there nothing more in married love it would not deserve to bear
   the name; but inasmuch as that involves the participation of life,
   industry, possessions, affections, and an unalterable fidelity,
   marriage, when rightly understood, is a very real and holy friendship.

   Whatever is founded on mere sensuality, vanity, or frivolity, is
   unworthy to be called friendship. I mean such attractions as are purely
   external; a sweet voice, personal beauty, and the cleverness or outward
   show which have great weight with some. You will often hear women and
   young people unhesitatingly decide that such an one is very delightful,
   very admirable, because he is good-looking, well-dressed, sings, or
   dances, or talks well. Even charlatans esteem the wittiest clown
   amongst them as their best man. But all these things are purely
   sensual, and the connections built on such foundation must be vain and
   frivolous, more fitly to be called trifling than friendship. They
   spring up chiefly among young people, who are easily fascinated by
   personal attractions, dress, and gossip--friendships in which the
   tailor and hairdresser have the chief part. How can such friendships be
   other than shortlived, melting away like snow wreaths in the sun!
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XVIII. On Frivolous Attachments.

   SUCH foolish attachments between man and woman without any matrimonial
   intentions as are called amourettes,--mere abortions, or rather
   phantoms of friendship,--must not, idle and empty as they are, profane
   the name of friendship or love. Yet such frivolous, contemptible
   attractions often snare the hearts of both men and women, and although
   they may end in downright sin, there is no such intention on the part
   of their victims, who consciously do but yield to foolish trifling and
   toying. Some such have no object beyond the actual indulgence of a
   passing inclination; others are excited by vanity, which takes pleasure
   in captivating hearts; some are stimulated by a combination of both
   these motives. But all such friendships are evil, hollow, and vain;
   evil, in that they often lead to sinful deeds, and draw the heart from
   God, and from the husband or wife who is its lawful owner; hollow, in
   that they are baseless and without root; vain, in that neither gain,
   honour, nor satisfaction can come from such. On the contrary, nothing
   comes of them but a loss of time and credit, and unreasoning
   excitement, mistrust, jealousy, and perturbation.

   S. Gregory Nazianzen speaks very wisely on this subject, admonishing
   vain women, and his words are equally applicable to men:--"Your natural
   beauty will suffice your husband, but if it is exhibited to all, like a
   net spread before birds, what will be the end? You will be taken by
   whoever admires you, looks and glances will be exchanged, smiles and
   tender words, at first hesitatingly exchanged, but soon more boldly
   given and received. Far be it from me to describe the end, but this
   much I will say, nothing said or done by young men and women under such
   circumstances but is perilous. One act of levity leads to another, as
   the links in a chain." They who tamper with such things will fall into
   the trap. They fancy that they only mean to amuse themselves, but will
   not go too far. Little you know, forsooth! The tiny spark will burst
   into a flame, and, overpowering your heart, it will reduce your good
   resolutions to ashes, and your reputation to smoke. "Who will pity a
   charmer that is bitten with a serpent?" asks the Wise Man; [104] and
   with him I ask, Do you, in your folly, imagine that you can lightly
   handle love as you please? You think to trifle with it, but it will
   sting you cruelly, and then every one will mock you, and laugh at your
   foolish pretension to harbour a venomous serpent in your bosom, which
   has poisoned and lost alike your honour and your soul. What fatal
   blindness this to stake all that is most precious to man! Yes, I say it
   advisedly, for God desires to have us only for the sake of our soul, or
   the soul through our will, and our will for love's sake. Surely we have
   not by any means a sufficient store of love to offer God, and yet in
   our madness and folly we lavish and waste it on vain frivolous objects,
   as though we had enough and to spare. Our Dear Lord, Who demands nought
   save our love in return for our creation, preservation and redemption,
   will require a strict account of the senseless way in which we have
   frittered and wasted it. If He will call us to account for idle words,
   how will it be with respect to idle, foolish, pernicious friendships?
   Husbandmen know that the walnut tree is very harmful in a vineyard or
   field, because it absorbs the fatness of the land and draws it away
   from the other crops; its thick foliage overshadows and deprives them
   of sunshine; and, moreover, it attracts passers-by, who tread down and
   spoil all that is around while striving to gather its fruit. So with
   these foolish love affairs and the soul; they engross it, so that it is
   unable to bring forth good works; their superfluous
   foliage--flirtations, dallyings and idle talk--consume profitable time;
   and, moreover, they lead to so many temptations, distractions,
   suspicions, and the like, that the heart becomes altogether crushed and
   spoiled. Such follies not only banish Heavenly Love, they likewise
   drive out the fear of God, enervate the mind, and damage reputation.
   They may be the plaything of courts, but assuredly they are as a plague
   spot of the heart. [105]

CHAPTER XIX. Of Real Friendship.

   DO you, my child, love every one with the pure love of charity, but
   have no friendship save with those whose intercourse is good and true,
   and the purer the bond which unites you so much higher will your
   friendship be. If your intercourse is based on science it is
   praiseworthy, still more if it arises from a participation in goodness,
   prudence, justice and the like; but if the bond of your mutual liking
   be charity, devotion and Christian perfection, God knows how very
   precious a friendship it is! Precious because it comes from God,
   because it tends to God, because God is the link that binds you,
   because it will last for ever in Him. Truly it is a blessed thing to
   love on earth as we hope to love in Heaven, and to begin that
   friendship here which is to endure for ever there. I am not now
   speaking of simple charity, a love due to all mankind, but of that
   spiritual friendship which binds souls together, leading them to share
   devotions and spiritual interests, so as to have but one mind between
   them. Such as these may well cry out, "Behold, how good and joyful a
   thing it is, brethren, to dwell together in unity!" [106] Even so, for
   the "precious ointment" of devotion trickles continually from one heart
   to the other, so that truly we may say that to such friendship the Lord
   promises His Blessing and life for evermore. To my mind all other
   friendship is but as a shadow with respect to this, its links mere
   fragile glass compared to the golden bond of true devotion. Do you form
   no other friendships. I say "form," because you have no right to cast
   aside or neglect the natural bonds which draw you to relations,
   connexions, benefactors or neighbours. My rules apply to those you
   deliberately choose to make. There are some who will tell you that you
   should avoid all special affection or friendship, as likely to engross
   the heart, distract the mind, excite jealousy, and what not. But they
   are confusing things. They have read in the works of saintly and devout
   writers that individual friendships and special intimacies are a great
   hindrance in the religious life, and therefore they suppose it to be
   the same with all the world, which is not at all the case. Whereas in a
   well-regulated community every one's aim is true devotion, there is no
   need for individual intercourse, which might exceed due limits;--in the
   world those who aim at a devout life require to be united one with
   another by a holy friendship, which excites, stimulates and encourages
   them in well-doing. Just as men traversing a plain have no need to hold
   one another up, as they have who are amid slippery mountain paths, so
   religious do not need the stay of individual friendships; but those who
   are living in the world require such for strength and comfort amid the
   difficulties which beset them. In the world all have not one aim, one
   mind, and therefore we must take to us congenial friends, nor is there
   any undue partiality in such attachments, which are but as the
   separation of good from evil, the sheep from the goats, the bee from
   the drone--a necessary separation.

   No one can deny that our Dear Lord loved S. John, Lazarus, Martha,
   Magdalene, with a specially tender friendship, since we are told so in
   Holy Scripture; and we know that S. Paul dearly loved S. Mark, S.
   Petronilla, as S. Paul Timothy and Thecla. [107] S. Gregory Nazianzen
   boasts continually of his friendship with the great S. Basil, of which
   he says: "It seemed as though with two bodies we had but one soul, and
   if we may not believe those who say that all things are in all else, at
   least one must affirm that we were two in one, and one in two --the
   only object that both had being to grow in holiness, and to mould our
   present life to our future hopes, thereby forsaking this mortal world
   before our death." And S. Augustine says that S. Ambrose loved S.
   Monica by reason of her many virtues, and that she in return loved him
   as an Angel of God.

   What need to affirm so unquestionable a fact! S. Jerome, S. Augustine,
   S. Gregory, S. Bernard, and all the most notable servants of God, have
   had special friendships, which in nowise hindered their perfection. S.
   Paul, in describing evil men, says that they were "without natural
   affection," [108] i.e. without friendship. And S. Thomas, in common
   with other philosophers, acknowledges that friendship is a virtue, and
   he certainly means individual friendships, because he says that we
   cannot bestow perfect friendship on many persons. So we see that the
   highest grace does not lie in being without friendships, but in having
   none which are not good, holy and true.

   [106] Ps. cxxxiii. 1.

   [107] S. Thecla (V.M.) was a native of Lycaonia, converted (so say S.
   Augustine, S. Ambrose, S. Epiphanius, and others of the Fathers) by S.
   Paul, who kindled so strong a love of virginity in her heart that she
   broke off her intended marriage, and devoted herself to Christ. She is
   said to have followed S. Paul in several of his journeys, and a very
   ancient Martyrology, which bears the name of S. Jerome, published by
   Florentinus, says that she was miraculously delivered unhurt from the
   persecutors' flames at Rome. It seems doubtful whether she died a
   natural or a martyr's death. The first Christian Emperors built a great
   Church at Seleucia, where she died.

CHAPTER XX. Of the Difference between True and False Friendship.

   TAKE notice, my child, that the honey of Heraclyum, which is so
   poisonous, altogether resembles that which is wholesome, and there is
   great danger of mistaking one for the other, or of mixing them, for the
   virtue of one would not counteract the harmfulness of the other. We
   must be on our guard not to be deceived in making friendships,
   especially between persons of the opposite sexes, for not unfrequently
   Satan deludes those who love one another. They may begin with a
   virtuous affection, but if discretion be lacking, frivolity will creep
   in, and then sensuality, till their love becomes carnal: even in
   spiritual love there is a danger if people are not on the watch,
   although it is not so easy to be deluded therein, inasmuch as the very
   purity and transparency of spiritual affection show Satan's stains more
   promptly. Consequently, when he seeks to interpose, he does it
   stealthily, and strives to insinuate impurity almost imperceptibly.

   You may distinguish between worldly friendship and that which is good
   and holy, just as one distinguishes that poisonous honey from what is
   good--it is sweeter to the taste than ordinary honey, owing to the
   aconite infused;--and so worldly friendship is profuse in honeyed
   words, passionate endearments, commendations of beauty and sensual
   charms, while true friendship speaks a simple honest language, lauding
   nought save the Grace of God, its one only foundation. That strange
   honey causes giddiness; and so false friendship upsets the mind, makes
   its victim to totter in the ways of purity and devotion, inducing
   affected, mincing looks, sensual caresses, inordinate sighings, petty
   complaints of not being loved, slight but questionable familiarities,
   gallantries, embraces, and the like, which are sure precursors of evil;
   whereas true friendship is modest and straightforward in every glance,
   loving and pure in caresses, has no sighs save for Heaven, no
   complaints save that God is not loved sufficiently. That honey confuses
   the sight, and worldly friendship confuses the judgment, so that men
   think themselves right while doing evil, and assume their excuses and
   pretexts to be valid reasoning. They fear the light and love darkness;
   but true friendship is clear-sighted, and hides nothing--rather seeks
   to be seen of good men. Lastly, this poisonous honey leaves an
   exceeding bitter taste behind; and so false friendship turns to evil
   desires, upbraidings, slander, deceit, sorrow, confusion and
   jealousies, too often ending in downright sin; but pure friendship is
   always the same--modest, courteous and loving--knowing no change save
   an increasingly pure and perfect union, a type of the blessed
   friendships of Heaven.

   When young people indulge in looks, words or actions which they would
   not like to be seen by their parents, husbands or confessors, it is a
   sure sign that they are damaging their conscience and their honour. Our
   Lady was troubled [109] when the Angel appeared to her in human form,
   because she was alone, and he spoke to her with flattering although
   heavenly words. O Saviour of the world, if purity itself fears an Angel
   in human shape, how much more need that our impurity should fear men,
   although they take the likeness of an Angel, if they speak words of
   earthliness and sensuality!

CHAPTER XXI. Remedies against Evil Friendships.

   HOW are you to meet the swarm of foolish attachments, triflings, and
   undesirable inclinations which beset you? By turning sharply away, and
   thoroughly renouncing such vanities, flying to the Saviour's Cross, and
   clasping His Crown of thorns to your heart, so that these little foxes
   may not spoil your vines. [110] Beware of entering into any manner of
   treaty with the Enemy; do not delude yourself by listening to him while
   intending to reject him. For God's Sake, my daughter, be firm on all
   such occasions; the heart and ear are closely allied, and just as you
   would vainly seek to check the downward course of a mountain torrent,
   so difficult will you find it to keep the smooth words which enter in
   at the ear from finding their way down into the heart. Alcmeon says
   (what indeed Aristotle denies) that the goat breathes through its ears,
   not its nostrils. I know not whether this be so, but one thing I know,
   that our heart breathes through the ear, and that while it exhales its
   own thoughts through the mouth, it inhales those of others by the ear.
   Let us then carefully guard our ears against evil words which would
   speedily infect the heart. Never hearken to any indiscreet conversation
   whatsoever--never mind if you seem rude and uncourteous in rejecting
   all such. Always bear in mind that you have dedicated your heart to
   God, and offered your love to Him; so that it were sacrilege to deprive
   Him of one particle thereof. Do you rather renew the offering
   continually by fresh resolutions, entrenching yourself therein as in a
   fortress;--cry out to God, He will succour you, and His Love will
   shelter you, so that all your love may be kept for Him only.

   If unhappily you are already entangled in the nets of any unreal
   affection, truly it is hard to set you free! But place yourself before
   His Divine Majesty, acknowledge the depth of your wretchedness, your
   weakness and vanity, and then with all the earnestness of purpose you
   can muster, arrest the budding evil, abjure your own empty promises,
   and renounce those you have received, and resolve with a firm, absolute
   will never again to indulge in any trifling or dallying with such
   matters.

   If you can remove from the object of your unworthy affection, it is
   most desirable to do so. He who has been bitten by a viper cannot heal
   his wound in the presence of another suffering from the like injury,
   and so one bitten with a false fancy will not shake it off while near
   to his fellow-victim. Change of scene is very helpful in quieting the
   excitement and restlessness of sorrow or love. S. Ambrose tells a story
   in his Second Book on Penitence, of a young man, who coming home after
   a long journey quite cured of a foolish attachment, met the unworthy
   object of his former passion, who stopped him, saying, "Do you not know
   me, I am still myself?" "That may be," was the answer, "but I am not
   myself:"--so thoroughly and happily was he changed by absence. And S.
   Augustine tells us how, after the death of his dear friend, he soothed
   his grief by leaving Tagaste and going to Carthage.

   But what is he to do, who cannot try this remedy? To such I would say,
   abstain from all private intercourse, all tender glances and smiles,
   and from every kind of communication which can feed the unholy flame.
   If it be necessary to speak at all, express clearly and tersely the
   eternal renunciation on which you have resolved. I say unhesitatingly
   to whosoever has become entangled in any such worthless love affairs,
   Cut it short, break it off--do not play with it, or pretend to untie
   the knot; cut it through, tear it asunder. There must be no dallying
   with an attachment which is incompatible with the Love of God.

   But, you ask, after I have thus burst the chains of my unholy bondage,
   will no traces remain, and shall I not still carry the scars on my
   feet--that is, in my wounded affections? Not so, my child, if you have
   attained a due abhorrence of the evil; in that case all you will feel
   is an exceeding horror of your unworthy affection, and all appertaining
   thereto; no thought will linger in your breast concerning it save a
   true love of God. Or if, by reason of the imperfection of your
   repentance, any evil inclinations still hover round you, seek such a
   mental solitude as I have already described, retire into it as much as
   possible, and then by repeated efforts and ejaculations renounce your
   evil desires; abjure them heartily; read pious books more than is your
   wont; go more frequently to Confession and Communion; tell your
   director simply and humbly all that tempts and troubles you, if you
   can, or at all events take counsel with some faithful, wise friend. And
   never doubt but that God will set you free from all evil passions, if
   you are stedfast and devout on your part. Perhaps you will say that it
   is unkind, ungrateful, thus pitilessly to break off a friendship.
   Surely it were a happy unkindness which is acceptable to God; but of a
   truth, my child, you are committing no unkindness, rather conferring a
   great benefit on the person you love, for you break his chains as well
   as your own, and although at the moment he may not appreciate his gain,
   he will do so by and by, and will join you in thanksgiving, "Thou,
   Lord, hast broken my bonds in sunder. I will offer to Thee the
   sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the Name of the Lord."

CHAPTER XXII. Further Advice concerning Intimacies.

   FRIENDSHIP demands very close correspondence between those who love one
   another, otherwise it can never take root or continue. And together
   with the interchange of friendship, other things imperceptibly glide
   in, and a mutual giving and receiving of emotions and inclinations
   takes place; especially when we esteem the object of our love very
   highly, because then we so entirely open our heart to him, that his
   influence rules us altogether, whether for good or evil. The bees which
   make that oriental honey of which I spoke, seek to gather nought save
   honey, but with it they suck up the poisonous juices of the aconite on
   which they light. So here, my child, we must bear in mind what our
   Saviour said about putting out our money to the exchangers; [112] we
   must seek to make a good exchange, not receiving bad money and good
   alike, and learning to distinguish that which is valuable from what is
   worthless, since scarcely any one is free from some imperfection, nor
   is there any reason why we should adopt all our friend's faults as well
   as his friendship. Of course we should love him notwithstanding his
   faults, but without loving those faults; true friendship implies an
   interchange of what is good, not what is evil. As men who drag the
   river Tagus sift the gold from its sands and throw the latter back upon
   the shore, so true friends should sift the sand of imperfections and
   reject it. S. Gregory Nazianzen tells us how certain persons who loved
   and admired S. Basil were led to imitate even his external blemishes,
   his slow, abstracted manner of speaking, the cut of his beard, and his
   peculiar gait. And so we see husbands and wives, children, friends,
   who, by reason of their great affection for one another,
   acquire--either accidentally or designedly--many foolish little ways
   and tricks peculiar to each. This ought not to be; for every one has
   enough imperfections of their own without adding those of anybody else,
   and friendship requires no such thing; on the contrary, it rather
   constrains us to help one another in getting rid of all sorts of
   imperfections. Of course we should bear with our friend's infirmities,
   but we should not encourage them, much less copy them.

   Of course I am speaking of imperfections only, for, as to sins, we must
   neither imitate or tolerate these in our friends. That is but a sorry
   friendship which would see a friend perish, and not try to save him;
   would watch him dying of an abscess without daring to handle the knife
   of correction which would save him. True and living friendship cannot
   thrive amid sin. There is a tradition that the salamander extinguishes
   any fire into which it enters, and so sin destroys friendship.
   Friendship will banish a casual sin by brotherly correction, but if the
   sin be persistent, friendship dies out,--it can only live in a pure
   atmosphere. Much less can true friendship ever lead any one into sin;
   our friend becomes an enemy if he seeks to do so, and deserves to lose
   our friendship, and there is no surer proof of the hollowness of
   friendship than its profession between evil-doers. If we love a vicious
   person, our friendship will be vicious too; it will be like those to
   whom it is given.

   Those who draw together for mere temporal profit, have no right to call
   their union friendship; it is not for love of one another that they
   unite, but for love of gain.

   There are two sayings in Holy Scripture on which all Christian
   friendship should be built:--that of the Wise Man, "Whoso feareth the
   Lord shall direct his friendship aright;" [113] and that of S. James,
   "The friendship of the world is enmity with God." [114]

CHAPTER XXIII. On The Practice of Bodily Mortification.

   IT has been said that if one writes a word on an almond, and then
   replace it carefully in its husk, and sow it, all the fruit borne by
   that tree will be marked by the word so inscribed. For my own part, I
   never could approve of beginning to reform any one by merely external
   things,--dress, the arrangement of hair, and outward show. On the
   contrary, it seems to me that one should begin from within. "Turn ye to
   Me with all your heart;" [115] "My son, give Me thine heart; " [116]
   for as the heart is the fount whence all our actions spring, they will
   be according to what it is. And the Heavenly Bridegroom, calling the
   soul, says, "Set Me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine
   arm." [117] Yes verily, for whosoever has Jesus Christ in his heart
   will soon show it in all his external actions. Therefore, my daughter,
   above all things I would write that precious and Holy Name JESUS in
   your heart, certain that having done so, your life--like the almond
   tree in the fable--will bear the stamp of that Saving Name in every
   act; and if the Dear Lord dwells within your heart, He will live in
   your every action, and will be traced in every member and part of you,
   so that you will be able to say with S. Paul, "I live, yet not I, but
   Christ liveth in me." [118] In a word, whosoever gains the heart has
   won the whole man. But this heart needs to be trained in its external
   conduct, so that it may display not merely a true devotion, but also
   wisdom and discretion. To this end I would make one or two suggestions.

   If you are able to fast, you will do well to observe some days beyond
   what are ordered by the Church, for besides the ordinary effect of
   fasting in raising the mind, subduing the flesh, confirming goodness,
   and obtaining a heavenly reward, it is also a great matter to be able
   to control greediness, and to keep the sensual appetites and the whole
   body subject to the law of the Spirit; and although we may be able to
   do but little, the enemy nevertheless stands more in awe of those whom
   he knows can fast. The early Christians selected Wednesday, Friday and
   Saturday as days of abstinence. Do you follow therein according as your
   own devotion and your director's discretion may appoint.

   I am prepared to say with S. Jerome (to the pious Leta) that I
   disapprove of long and immoderate fasting, especially for the young. I
   have learnt by experience that when the colt grows weary it turns
   aside, and so when young people become delicate by excessive fasting,
   they readily take to self-indulgence. The stag does not run with due
   speed either when over fat or too thin, and we are in peril of
   temptation both when the body is overfed or underfed; in the one case
   it grows indolent, in the other it sinks through depression, and if we
   cannot bear with it in the first case, neither can it bear with us in
   the last. A want of moderation in the use of fasting, discipline and
   austerity has made many a one useless in works of charity during the
   best years of his life, as happened to S. Bernard, who repented of his
   excessive austerity. Those who misuse the body at the outset will have
   to indulge it overmuch at last. Surely it were wiser to deal sensibly
   with it, and treat it according to the work and service required by
   each man's state of life.

   Fasting and labour both exhaust and subdue the body. If your work is
   necessary or profitable to God's Glory, I would rather see you bear the
   exhaustion of work than of fasting. Such is the mind of the Church, who
   dispenses those who are called to work for God or their neighbour even
   from her prescribed fasts. One man finds it hard to fast, another finds
   it as hard to attend the sick, to visit prisons, to hear confessions,
   preach, minister to the afflicted, pray, and the like. And the last
   hardship is better than the other; for while it subdues the flesh
   equally, it brings forth better fruit. And as a general rule it is
   better to preserve more bodily strength than is absolutely necessary,
   than to damage it more than is necessary. Bodily strength can always be
   lowered if needful, but we cannot restore it at will. It seems to me
   that we ought to have in great reverence that which our Saviour and
   Redeemer Jesus Christ said to His disciples, "Eat such things as are
   set before you." [119] To my mind there is more virtue in eating
   whatever is offered you just as it comes, whether you like it or not,
   than in always choosing what is worst; for although the latter course
   may seem more ascetic, the former involves greater submission of will,
   because by it you give up not merely your taste, but your choice; and
   it is no slight austerity to hold up one's likings in one's hand, and
   subject them to all manner of accidents. Furthermore, this kind of
   mortification makes no show, inconveniences no one, and is admirably
   adapted to social life. To be always discarding one dish for another,
   examining everything, suspicious as to everything, making a fuss over
   every morsel--all this to my mind is contemptible, and implies too much
   thought of meats and platters. To my mind there was more austerity in
   S. Bernard's drinking oil by mistake for wine or water than if he had
   deliberately drunk wormwood, for it showed that he was not thinking of
   what he drank. And the real meaning of those sacred words, "Eat such
   things as are set before you," lies in such an indifference to what one
   eats and drinks. I should make an exception of any food which is
   unwholesome, or likely to be injurious to the mind's energies, such as
   certain hot, spiced, or stimulating dishes; as also on certain
   occasions when nature requires to be refreshed and invigorated in order
   to perform the work needful for God's Glory. At all times a constant
   habitual moderation is better than occasional excessive abstinence,
   alternated with great indulgence. The discipline has a surprising
   effect in rousing the taste for devotion, if used moderately. The body
   is greatly subdued by the use of the hair shirt, but it is not fit for
   ordinary people, married persons, those who are delicate, or who have
   to bear considerable fatigue. On certain days of special penitence it
   may be used, subject to the counsel of a judicious confessor.

   Every one must take so much of the night for sleep, as his
   constitution, and the profitable performance of his day's work,
   requires. Holy Scripture continually teaches us that the morning is the
   best and most profitable part of the day, and so do the examples of the
   Saints and our natural reason. Our Lord Himself is called the Sun,
   risinig upon the earth, and our Lady the Day-star; and so I think it is
   wise to go to sleep early at night in order to be ready to waken and
   rise early. Moreover, that is the pleasantest, the freshest, and the
   freest hour of the day,--the very birds stimulate us to rise and sing
   God's praises. Early rising promotes both health and holiness.

   Balaam saddled his ass and went to meet Balak, but his heart was not
   right with God, and therefore the Angel of the Lord stood in the way,
   with a sword in his hand to kill him, had not the ass three times
   turned out of the way as though she were restive; whereat Balaam smote
   her with his staff, until at last she fell down beneath him, and her
   mouth being miraculously opened, she said unto him, "What have I done
   unto thee that thou hast smitten me these three times?" Then Balaam's
   eyes were opened, and he saw the Angel, who said to him, "Wherefore
   hast thou smitten thine ass? unless she had turned from me surely now I
   had slain thee, and saved her alive." Then Balaam said to the Angel of
   the Lord, "I have sinned, for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way
   against me." [120] Do you see, my daughter, it was Balaam who did
   wrong, but he beat the poor ass, who was not to blame. It is often so
   with us. A woman's husband or child is ill, and forthwith she has
   recourse to fasting, the discipline, and hair shirt, even as David did
   on a like occasion. [121] But, dear friend, you are smiting the ass!
   you afflict your body, which can do nothing when God stands before you
   with His sword unsheathed. Rather correct your heart, which idolises
   your husband, and has indulged your child, letting him give way to
   pride, vanity, and ambition. Or, again, a man falls often into fleshly
   sins, and the voice of conscience stands before him in the way, rousing
   him to a holy fear. Then recollecting himself, he begins to abuse his
   flesh for betraying him, he deals out strict fasts, severe discipline,
   and the like, to it, and meanwhile the poor flesh might cry out like
   Balaam's ass, Why smitest thou me? It is you yourself, O my soul, that
   are guilty. Wherefore do you force me into evil, using my eyes, and
   hands, and lips for unholy purposes, and tormenting me with evil
   imaginations? Do you entertain only good thoughts, and I shall feel no
   unholy impulses, frequent none save pious people, and I shall not be
   kindled with guilty fire. You cast me yourself into the flames, and bid
   me not to burn! you fill my eyes with smoke, and wonder that they are
   inflamed! But God bids you deal chiefly with your heart, for that is
   the chief offender. When a man suffers from the itch, there is less
   need to bathe him, and cleanse the surface, than to purify his blood;
   and so, in order to purge our vices, no doubt it is well to mortify the
   flesh, but above all it is necessary to purify the affections and renew
   the heart. Make it a rule then never to undertake any bodily
   austerities without the advice of your spiritual guide.

CHAPTER XXIV. Of Society and Solitude.

   EITHER to seek or to shun society is a fault in one striving to lead a
   devout life in the world, such as I am now speaking of. To shun society
   implies indifference and contempt for one's neighbours; and to seek it
   savours of idleness and uselessness. We are told to love one's
   neighbour as one's self. In token that we love him, we must not avoid
   being with him, and the test of loving one's self is to be happy when
   alone. "Think first on thyself," says S. Bernard, "and then on other
   men." So that, if nothing obliges you to mix in society either at home
   or abroad, retire within yourself, and hold converse with your own
   heart. But if friends come to you, or there is fitting cause for you to
   go forth into society, then, my daughter, by all means go, and meet
   your neighbour with a kindly glance and a kindly heart.

   Bad society is all such intercourse with others as has an evil object,
   or when those with whom we mix are vicious, indiscreet, or profligate.
   From such as these turn away, like the bee from a dunghill. The breath
   and saliva of those who have been bitten by a mad dog is dangerous,
   especially to children or delicate people, and in like manner it is
   perilous to associate with vicious, reckless people, above all to those
   whose devotion is still weakly and unstable.

   There is a kind of social intercourse which merely tends to refresh us
   after more serious labour, and although it would not be well to indulge
   in this to excess, there is no harm in enjoying it during your leisure
   hours.

   Other social meetings are in compliance with courtesy, such as mutual
   visits, and certain assemblies with a view to pay respect to one
   another. As to these, without being a slave to them, it is well not to
   despise them altogether, but to bear one's own due part in them
   quietly, avoiding rudeness and frivolity. Lastly, there is a profitable
   society;--that of good devout people, and it will always be very good
   for you to meet with them. Vines grown amid olivetrees are wont to bear
   rich grapes, and he who frequents the society of good people will
   imbibe some of their goodness. The bumble bee makes no honey alone, but
   if it falls among bees it works with them. Our own devout life will be
   materially helped by intercourse with other devout souls.

   Simplicity, gentleness and modesty are to be desired in all
   society;--there are some people who are so full of affectation in
   whatever they do that every one is annoyed by them. A man who could not
   move without counting his steps, or speak without singing, would be
   very tiresome to everybody, and just so any one who is artificial in
   all he does spoils the pleasure of society; and moreover such people
   are generally more or less self-conceited. A quiet cheerfulness should
   be your aim in society. S. Romuald and S. Anthony are greatly lauded
   because, notwithstanding their asceticism, their countenance and words
   were always courteous and cheerful. I would say to you with S. Paul,
   "Rejoice with them that do rejoice;" [122] and again, "Rejoice in the
   Lord alway: let your moderation be known unto all men." [123] And if
   you would rejoice in the Lord, the cause of your joy must not only be
   lawful, but worthy; and remember this, because there are lawful things
   which nevertheless are not good; and in order that your moderation may
   be known, you must avoid all that is impertinent and uncivil, which is
   sure to be wrong. Depreciating this person, slandering another,
   wounding a third, stimulating the folly of a fourth--all such things,
   however amusing, are foolish and impertinent.

   I have already spoken of that mental solitude into which you can retire
   when amid the greatest crowd, and furthermore you should learn to like
   a real material solitude. Not that I want you to fly to a desert like
   S. Mary of Egypt, S. Paul, S. Anthony, Arsenius, or the other hermits,
   but it is well for you to retire sometimes within your own chamber or
   garden, or wheresoever you can best recollect your mind, and refresh
   your soul with good and holy thoughts, and some spiritual reading, as
   the good Bishop of Nazianzum tells us was his custom. "I was walking
   alone," he says, "at sunset, on the seashore, a recreation I am wont to
   take in order somewhat to lay aside my daily worries." And S. Augustine
   says that he often used to go into S. Ambrose' room--his door was open
   to every one,--and after watching him absorbed in reading for a time,
   he would retire without speaking, fearing to interrupt the Bishop, who
   had so little time for refreshing his mind amid the burden of his heavy
   duties. And we read how when the disciples came to Jesus, and told Him
   all they had been doing and preaching, He said to them, "Come ye
   yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest awhile." [124]

CHAPTER XXV. On Modesty in Dress.

   S. PAUL expresses his desire that all Christian women should wear
   "modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety;" [125] --and for
   that matter he certainly meant that men should do so likewise. Now,
   modesty in dress and its appurtenances depends upon the quality, the
   fashion and the cleanliness thereof. As to cleanliness, that should be
   uniform, and we should never, if possible, let any part of our dress be
   soiled or stained. External seemliness is a sort of indication of
   inward good order, and God requires those who minister at His Altar, or
   minister in holy things, to be attentive in respect of personal
   cleanliness. As to the quality and fashion of clothes, modesty in these
   points must depend upon various circumstances, age, season, condition,
   the society we move in, and the special occasion. Most people dress
   better on a high festival than at other times; in Lent, or other
   penitential seasons, they lay aside all gay apparel; at a wedding they
   wear wedding garments, at a funeral, mourning garb; and at a king's
   court the dress which would be unsuitable at home is suitable. A wife
   may and should adorn herself according to her husband's wishes when he
   is present;--if she does as much in his absence one is disposed to ask
   in whose eyes she seeks to shine? We may grant somewhat greater
   latitude to maidens, who may lawfully desire to attract many, although
   only with the view of ultimately winning one in holy matrimony. Neither
   do I blame such widows as purpose to marry again for adorning
   themselves, provided they keep within such limits as are seemly for
   those who are at the head of a family, and who have gone through the
   sobering sorrows of widowhood. But for those who are widows indeed, in
   heart as well as outwardly, humility, modesty and devotion are the only
   suitable ornaments. If they seek to attract men's admiration they are
   not widows indeed, and if they have no such intention, why should they
   wear its tokens? Those who do not mean to entertain guests should take
   down their signboard. So, again, every one laughs at old women who
   affect youthful graces,--such things are only tolerable in the young.

   Always be neat, do not ever permit any disorder or untidiness about
   you. There is a certain disrespect to those with whom you mix in
   slovenly dress; but at the same time avoid all vanity, peculiarity, and
   fancifulness. As far as may be, keep to what is simple and
   unpretending--such dress is the best adornment of beauty and the best
   excuse for ugliness. S. Peter bids women not to be over particular in
   dressing their hair. Every one despises a man as effeminate who lowers
   himself by such things, and we count a vain woman as wanting in
   modesty, or at all events what she has becomes smothered among her
   trinkets and furbelows. They say that they mean no harm, but I should
   reply that the devil will contrive to get some harm out of it all. For
   my own part I should like my devout man or woman to be the best dressed
   person in the company, but the least fine or splendid, and adorned, as
   S. Peter says, with "the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit." [126] S.
   Louis said that the right thing is for every one to dress according to
   his position, so that good and sensible people should not be able to
   say they are over-dressed, or younger gayer ones that they are
   under-dressed. But if these last are not satisfied with what is modest
   and seemly, they must be content with the approbation of the elders.

CHAPTER XXVI. Of Conversation; and, first, how to Speak of God.

   PHYSICIANS judge to a great extent as to the health or disease of a man
   by the state of his tongue, and our words are a true test of the state
   of our soul. "By thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words
   thou shalt be condemned," [127] the Saviour says. We are apt to apply
   the hand quickly to the place where we feel pain, and so too the tongue
   is quick to point out what we love.

   If you love God heartily, my child, you will often speak of Him among
   your relations, household and familiar friends, and that because "the
   mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of
   judgment." [128] Even as the bee touches nought save honey with his
   tongue, so should your lips be ever sweetened with your God, knowing
   nothing more pleasant than to praise and bless His Holy Name,--as we
   are told that when S. Francis uttered the Name of the Lord, he seemed
   to feel the sweetness lingering on his lips, and could not let it go.
   But always remember, when you speak of God, that He is God; and speak
   reverently and with devotion,--not affectedly or as if you were
   preaching, but with a spirit of meekness, love, and humility; dropping
   honey from your lips (like the Bride in the Canticles [129] ) in devout
   and pious words, as you speak to one or another around, in your secret
   heart the while asking God to let this soft heavenly dew sink into
   their minds as they hearken. And remember very specially always to
   fulfil this angelic task meekly and lovingly, not as though you were
   reproving others, but rather winning them. It is wonderful how
   attractive a gentle, pleasant manner is, and how much it wins hearts.

   Take care, then, never to speak of God, or those things which concern
   Him, in a merely formal, conventional manner; but with earnestness and
   devotion, avoiding the affected way in which some professedly religious
   people are perpetually interlarding their conversation with pious words
   and sayings, after a most unseasonable and unthinking manner. Too often
   they imagine that they really are themselves as pious as their words,
   which probably is not the case.

CHAPTER XXVII. Of Unseemly Words, and the Respect due to Others.

   SAINT JAMES says, "If any man offend not in word, the same is, a
   perfect man." [130] Beware most watchfully against ever uttering any
   unseemly expression; even though you may have no evil intention, those
   who hear it may receive it with a different meaning. An impure word
   falling upon a weak mind spreads its infection like a drop of oil on a
   garment, and sometimes it will take such a hold of the heart, as to
   fill it with an infinitude of lascivious thoughts and temptations. The
   body is poisoned through the mouth, even so is the heart through the
   ear; and the tongue which does the deed is a murderer, even when the
   venom it has infused is counteracted by some antidote preoccupying the
   listener's heart. It was not the speaker's fault that he did not slay
   that soul. Nor let any one answer that he meant no harm. Our Lord, Who
   knoweth the hearts of men, has said, "Out of the abundance of the heart
   the mouth speaketh." [131] And even if we do mean no harm, the Evil One
   means a great deal, and he will use those idle words as a sharp weapon
   against some neighbour's heart. It is said that those who eat the plant
   called Angelica always have a sweet, pleasant breath; and those who
   cherish the angelic virtues of purity and modesty, will always speak
   simply, courteously, and modestly. As to unclean and light-minded talk,
   S. Paul says such things should not even be named [132] among us, for,
   as he elsewhere tells us, "Evil communications corrupt good manners."
   [133]

   Those impure words which are spoken in disguise, and with an
   affectation of reserve, are the most harmful of all; for just as the
   sharper the point of a dart, so much deeper it will pierce the flesh,
   so the sharper an unholy word, the more it penetrates the heart. And as
   for those who think to show themselves knowing when they say such
   things, they do not even understand the first object of mutual
   intercourse among men, who ought rather to be like a hive of bees
   gathering to make honey by good and useful conversation, than like a
   wasps' nest, feeding on corruption. If any impertinent person addresses
   you in unseemly language, show that you are displeased by turning away,
   or by whatever other method your discretion may indicate.

   One of the most evil dispositions possible is that which satirises and
   turns everything to ridicule. God abhors this vice, and has sometimes
   punished it in a marked manner. Nothing is so opposed to charity, much
   more to a devout spirit, as contempt and depreciation of one's
   neighbour, and where satire and ridicule exist contempt must be.
   Therefore contempt is a grievous sin, and our spiritual doctors have
   well said that ridicule is the greatest sin we can commit in word
   against our neighbour, inasmuch as when we offend him in any other way,
   there may still be some respect for him in our heart, but we are sure
   to despise those whom we ridicule.

   There is a light-hearted talk, full of modest life and gaiety, which
   the Greeks called Eutrapelia, and which we should call good
   conversation, by which we may find an innocent and kindly amusement out
   of the trifling occurrences which human imperfections afford. Only
   beware of letting this seemly mirth go too far, till it becomes
   ridicule. Ridicule excites mirth at the expense of one's neighbour;
   seemly mirth and playful fun never lose sight of a trustful, kindly
   courtesy, which can wound no one. When the religious around him would
   fain have discussed serious matters with S. Louis at meal-times, he
   used to say, "This is not the time for grave discussion, but for
   general conversation and cheerful recreation,"--out of consideration
   for his courtiers. But, my daughter, let our recreation always be so
   spent, that we may win all eternity through devotion.

CHAPTER XXVIII. Of Hasty Judgments.

   JUDGE not, and ye shall not be judged," said the Saviour of our souls;
   "condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned:" [134] and the Apostle S.
   Paul, "Judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, Who both
   will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make
   manifest the counsels of the hearts." [135] Of a truth, hasty judgments
   are most displeasing to God, and men's judgments are hasty, because we
   are not judges one of another, and by judging we usurp our Lord's own
   office. Man's judgment is hasty, because the chief malice of sin lies
   in the intention and counsel of the heart, which is shrouded in
   darkness to us. Moreover, man's judgments are hasty, because each one
   has enough to do in judging himself, without undertaking to judge his
   neighbour. If we would not be judged, it behoves us alike not to judge
   others, and to judge ourselves. Our Lord forbids the one, His Apostle
   enjoins the other, saying, "If we would judge ourselves, we should not
   be judged." [136] But alas! for the most part we precisely reverse
   these precepts, judging our neighbour, which is forbidden on all sides,
   while rarely judging ourselves, as we are told to do.

   We must proceed to rectify rash judgments, according to their cause.
   Some hearts there are so bitter and harsh by nature, that everything
   turns bitter under their touch; men who, in the Prophet's words, "turn
   judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth." [137]
   Such as these greatly need to be dealt with by some wise spiritual
   physician, for this bitterness being natural to them, it is hard to
   conquer; and although it be rather an imperfection than a sin, still it
   is very dangerous, because it gives rise to and fosters rash judgments
   and slander within the heart. Others there are who are guilty of rash
   judgments less out of a bitter spirit than from pride, supposing to
   exalt their own credit by disparaging that of others. These are
   self-sufficient, presumptuous people, who stand so high in their own
   conceit that they despise all else as mean and worthless. It was the
   foolish Pharisee who said, "I am not as other men are." [138] Others,
   again, have not quite such overt pride, but rather a lurking little
   satisfaction in beholding what is wrong in others, in order to
   appreciate more fully what they believe to be their own superiority.
   This satisfaction is so well concealed, so nearly imperceptible, that
   it requires a clear sight to discover it, and those who experience it
   need that it be pointed out to them. Some there are who seek to excuse
   and justify themselves to their own conscience, by assuming readily
   that others are guilty of the same faults, or as great ones, vainly
   imagining that the sin becomes less culpable when shared by many.
   Others, again, give way to rash judgments merely because they take
   pleasure in a philosophic analysis and dissection of their neighbours'
   characters; and if by ill luck they chance now and then to be right,
   their presumption and love of criticism strengthens almost incurably.

   Then there are people whose judgment is solely formed by inclination;
   who always think well of those they like, and ill of those they
   dislike. To this, however, there is one rare exception, which
   nevertheless we do sometimes meet, when an excessive love provokes a
   false judgment concerning its object; the hideous result of a diseased,
   faulty, restless affection, which is in fact jealousy; an evil passion
   capable, as everybody knows, of condemning others of perfidy and
   adultery upon the most trivial and fanciful ground. In like manner,
   fear, ambition, and other moral infirmities often tend largely to
   produce suspicion and rash judgments.

   What remedy can we apply? They who drink the juice of the Ethiopian
   herb Ophiusa imagine that they see serpents and horrors everywhere; and
   those who drink deep of pride, envy, ambition, hatred, will see harm
   and shame in every one they look upon. The first can only be cured by
   drinking palm wine, and so I say of these latter,--Drink freely of the
   sacred wine of love, and it will cure you of the evil tempers which
   lead you to these perverse judgments. So far from seeking out that
   which is evil, Love dreads meeting with it, and when such meeting is
   unavoidable, she shuts her eyes at the first symptom, and then in her
   holy simplicity she questions whether it were not merely a fantastic
   shadow which crossed her path rather than sin itself. Or if Love is
   forced to recognise the fact, she turns aside hastily, and strives to
   forget what she has seen. Of a truth, Love is the great healer of all
   ills, and of this above the rest. Everything looks yellow to a man that
   has the jaundice; and it is said that the only cure is through the
   soles of the feet. Most assuredly the sin of rash judgments is a
   spiritual jaundice, which makes everything look amiss to those who have
   it; and he who would be cured of this malady must not be content with
   applying remedies to his eyes or his intellect, he must attack it
   through the affections, which are as the soul's feet. If your
   affections are warm and tender, your judgment will not be harsh; if
   they are loving, your judgment will be the same. Holy Scripture offers
   us three striking illustrations. Isaac, when in the Land of Gerar, gave
   out that Rebecca was his sister, but when Abimelech saw their
   familiarity, he at once concluded that she was his wife. [139] A
   malicious mind would rather have supposed that there was some unlawful
   connection between them, but Abimelech took the most charitable view of
   the case that was possible. And so ought we always to judge our
   neighbour as charitably as may be; and if his actions are many-sided,
   we should accept the best. Again, when S. Joseph found that the Blessed
   Virgin was with child, [140] knowing her to be pure and holy, he could
   not believe that there was any sin in her, and he left all judgment to
   God, although there was strong presumptive evidence on which to condemn
   her. And the Holy Spirit speaks of S. Joseph as "a just man." When a
   just man cannot see any excuse for what is done by a person in whose
   general worth he believes, he still refrains from judging him, and
   leaves all to God's Judgment. Again, our Crucified Saviour, while He
   could not wholly ignore the sin of those who Crucified Him, yet made
   what excuse He might for them, pleading their ignorance. [141] And so
   when we cannot find any excuse for sin, let us at least claim what
   compassion we may for it, and impute it to the least damaging motives
   we can find, as ignorance or infirmity.

   Are we never, then, to judge our neighbour? you ask. Never, my child.
   It is God Who judges criminals brought before a court of law. He uses
   magistrates to convey His sentence to us; they are His interpreters,
   and have only to proclaim His law. If they go beyond this, and are led
   by their own passions, then they do themselves judge, and for so doing
   they will be judged. It is forbidden to all men alike, as men, to judge
   one another.

   We do not necessarily judge because we see or are conscious of
   something wrong. Rash judgment always presupposes something that is not
   clear, in spite of which we condemn another. It is not wrong to have
   doubts concerning a neighbour, but we ought to be very watchful lest
   even our doubts or suspicions be rash and hasty. A malicious person
   seeing Jacob kiss Rachel at the well-side, [142] or Rebecca accepting
   jewels from Eleazer, [143] a stranger, might have suspected them of
   levity, though falsely and unreasonably. If an action is in itself
   indifferent, it is a rash suspicion to imagine that it means evil,
   unless there is strong circumstantial evidence to prove such to be the
   case. And it is a rash judgment when we draw condemnatory inferences
   from an action which may be blameless.

   Those who keep careful watch over their conscience are not often liable
   to form rash judgments, for just as when the clouds lower the bees make
   for the shelter of their hive, so really good people shrink back into
   themselves, and refuse to be mixed up with the clouds and fogs of their
   neighbour's questionable doings, and rather than meddle with others,
   they consecrate their energies on their own improvement and good
   resolutions.

   No surer sign of an unprofitable life than when people give way to
   censoriousness and inquisitiveness into the lives of other men. Of
   course exception must be made as to those who are responsible for
   others, whether in family or public life;--to all such it becomes a
   matter of conscience to watch over the conduct of their fellows. Let
   them fulfil their duty lovingly, and let them also give heed to
   restrain themselves within the bounds of that duty.

CHAPTER XXIX. On Slander.

   FROM rash judgments proceed mistrust, contempt for others, pride, and
   self-sufficiency, and numberless other pernicious results, among which
   stands forth prominently the sin of slander, which is a veritable pest
   of society. Oh, wherefore can I not take a live coal from God's Altar,
   and touch the lips of men, so that their iniquity may be taken away and
   their sin purged, even as the Seraphim purged the lips of Isaiah. [144]
   He who could purge the world of slander would cleanse it from a great
   part of its sinfulness!

   He who unjustly takes away his neighbour's good name is guilty of sin,
   and is bound to make reparation, according to the nature of his evil
   speaking; since no man can enter into Heaven cumbered with stolen
   goods, and of all worldly possessions the most precious is a good name.
   Slander is a kind of murder; for we all have three lives--a spiritual
   life, which depends upon the Grace of God; a bodily life, depending on
   the soul; and a civil life, consisting in a good reputation. Sin
   deprives us of the first, death of the second, and slander of the
   third. But the slanderer commits three several murders with his idle
   tongue: he destroys his own soul and that of him who hearkens, as well
   as causing civil death to the object of his slander; for, as S. Bernard
   says, the Devil has possession both of the slanderer and of those who
   listen to him, of the tongue of the one, the ear of the other. And
   David says of slanderers, "They have sharpened their tongues like a
   serpent; adders' poison is under their lips." [145] Aristotle says
   that, like the forked, two-edged tongue of the serpent, so is that of
   the slanderer, who at one dart pricks and poisons the ear of those who
   hear him, and the reputation of him who is slandered.

   My daughter, I entreat you never speak evil of any, either directly or
   indirectly; beware of ever unjustly imputing sins or faults to your
   neighbour, of needlessly disclosing his real faults, of exaggerating
   such as are overt, of attributing wrong motives to good actions, of
   denying the good that you know to exist in another, of maliciously
   concealing it, or depreciating it in conversation. In all and each of
   these ways you grievously offend God, although the worst is false
   accusation, or denying the truth to your neighbour's damage, since
   therein you combine his harm with falsehood.

   Those who slander others with an affectation of good will, or with
   dishonest pretences of friendliness, are the most spiteful and evil of
   all. They will profess that they love their victim, and that in many
   ways he is an excellent man, but all the same, truth must be told, and
   he was very wrong in such a matter; or that such and such a woman is
   very virtuous generally, but and so on. Do you not see through the
   artifice? He who draws a bow draws the arrow as close as he can to
   himself, but it is only to let it fly more forcibly; and so such
   slanderers appear to be withholding their evil-speaking, but it is only
   to let it fly with surer aim and go deeper into the listeners' minds.
   Witty slander is the most mischievous of all; for just as some poisons
   are but feeble when taken alone, which become powerful when mixed with
   wine, so many a slander, which would go in at one ear and out at the
   other of itself, finds a resting-place in the listener's brain when it
   is accompanied with amusing, witty comments. "The poison of asps is
   under their lips." The asp's bite is scarcely perceptible, and its
   poison at first only causes an irritation which is scarcely
   disagreeable, so that the heart and nervous system dilate and receive
   that poison, against which later on there is no remedy.

   Do not pronounce a man to be a drunkard although you may have seen him
   drunk, or an adulterer, because you know he has sinned; a single act
   does not stamp him for ever. The sun once stood still while Joshua and
   the children of Israel avenged themselves upon their enemies; [146] and
   another time it was darkened at mid-day when the Lord was crucified;
   [147] but no one would therefore say that it was stationary or dark.
   Noah was drunk once, and Lot, moreover, was guilty of incest, yet
   neither man could be spoken of as habitually given to such sins;
   neither would you call S. Paul a man of blood or a blasphemer, because
   he had blasphemed and shed blood before he became a Christian. Before a
   man deserves to be thus stigmatised, he must have formed a habit of the
   sin he is accused of, and it is unfair to call a man passionate or a
   thief, because you have once known him steal or fly into a passion.
   Even when a man may have persisted long in sin, you may say what is
   untrue in calling him vicious. Simon the leper called Magdalene a
   sinner, because she had once lived a life of sin; but he lied, for she
   was a sinner no longer, but rather a very saintly penitent, and so our
   Lord Himself undertook her defence. [148]

   The Pharisee looked upon the publican as a great sinner,--probably as
   unjust, extortionate, adulterous; [149] but how mistaken he was,
   inasmuch as the condemned publican was even then justified! If God's
   Mercy is so great, that one single moment is sufficient for it to
   justify and save a man, what assurance have we that he who yesterday
   was a sinner is the same to-day? Yesterday may not be the judge of
   today, nor to-day of yesterday: all will be really judged at the Last
   Great Day. In short, we can never affirm a man to be evil without
   running the risk of lying. If it be absolutely necessary to speak, we
   may say that he was guilty of such an act, that he led an evil life at
   such and such a time, or that he is doing certain wrong at the present
   day; but we have no right to draw deductions for to-day from yesterday,
   nor of yesterday from today; still less to speak with respect to the
   future.

   But while extremely sensitive as to the slightest approach to slander,
   you must also guard against an extreme into which some people fall,
   who, in their desire to speak evil of no one, actually uphold and speak
   well of vice. If you have to do with one who is unquestionably a
   slanderer, do not excuse him under the expressions of frank and
   free-spoken; do not call one who is notoriously vain, liberal and
   elegant; do not call dangerous levities mere simplicity; do not screen
   disobedience under the name of zeal, or arrogance of frankness, or evil
   intimacy of friendship. No, my child, we must never, in our wish to
   shun slander, foster or flatter vice in others; but we must call evil
   evil, and sin sin, and so doing we shall serve God's Glory, always
   bearing in mind the following rules.

   If you would be justified in condemning a neighbour's sin, you must be
   sure that it is needful either for his good or that of others to do so.
   For instance, if light, unseemly conduct is spoken of before young
   people in a way calculated to injure their purity, and you pass it
   over, or excuse it, they may be led to think lightly of evil, and to
   imitate it; and therefore you are bound to condemn all such things
   freely and at once, unless it is obvious that by reserving your
   charitable work of reprehension to a future time, you can do it more
   profitably.

   Furthermore, on such occasions it is well to be sure that you are the
   most proper person among those present to express your opinion, and
   that your silence would seem in any way to condone the sin. If you are
   one of the least important persons present, it is probably not your
   place to censure; but supposing it to be your duty, be most carefully
   just in what you say,--let there not be a word too much or too little.
   For instance, you censure the intimacy of certain people, as dangerous
   and indiscreet. Well, but you must hold the scales with the most exact
   justice, and not exaggerate in the smallest item. If there be only a
   slight appearance of evil, say no more than that; if it be a question
   of some trifling imprudence, do not make it out to be more; if there be
   really neither imprudence nor positive appearance of evil, but only
   such as affords a pretext for malicious slander, either say simply so
   much, or, better still, say nothing at all. When you speak of your
   neighbour, look upon your tongue as a sharp razor in the surgeon's
   hand, about to cut nerves and tendons; it should be used so carefully,
   as to insure that no particle more or less than the truth be said. And
   finally, when you are called upon to blame sin, always strive as far as
   possible to spare the sinner.

   Public, notorious sinners may be spoken of freely, provided always even
   then that a spirit of charity and compassion prevail, and that you do
   not speak of them with arrogance or presumption, or as though you took
   pleasure in the fall of others. To do this is the sure sign of a mean
   ungenerous mind. And, of course, you must speak freely in condemnation
   of the professed enemies of God and His Church, heretics and
   schismatics,--it is true charity to point out the wolf wheresoever he
   creeps in among the flock. Most people permit themselves absolute
   latitude in criticising and censuring rulers, and in calumniating
   nationalities, according to their own opinions and likings. But do you
   avoid this fault; it is displeasing to God, and is liable to lead you
   into disputes and quarrels. When you hear evil of any one, cast any
   doubt you fairly can upon the accusation; or if that is impossible,
   make any available excuse for the culprit; and where even that may not
   be, be yet pitiful and compassionate, and remind those with whom you
   are speaking that such as stand upright do so solely through God's
   Grace. Do your best kindly to check the scandal-bearer, and if you know
   anything favourable to the person criticised, take pains to mention it.

CHAPTER XXX. Further Counsels as to Conversation.

   LET your words be kindly, frank, sincere, straightforward, simple and
   true; avoid all artifice, duplicity and pretence, remembering that,
   although it is not always well to publish abroad everything that may be
   true, yet it is never allowable to oppose the truth. Make it your rule
   never knowingly to say what is not strictly true, either accusing or
   excusing, always remembering that God is the God of Truth. If you have
   unintentionally said what is not true, and it is possible to correct
   yourself at once by means of explanation or reparation, do so. A
   straightforward excuse has far greater weight than any falsehood.

   It may be lawful occasionally to conceal or disguise the truth, but
   this should never be done save in such special cases as make this
   reserve obviously a necessity for the service and glory of God.
   Otherwise all such artifice is dangerous; and we are told in Holy
   Scripture that God's Holy Spirit will not abide with the false or
   double-minded. Depend upon it there is no craft half so profitable and
   successful as simplicity. Worldly prudence and artifice belong to the
   children of this world; but the children of God go straight on with a
   single heart and in all confidence;--falsehood, deceit and duplicity
   are sure signs of a mean, weak mind.

   In the Fourth Book of his Confessions, S. Augustine spoke in very
   strong terms of his passionate devotion to a friend, saying that they
   had but as one soul, and that after his friend's death his life was a
   horror to him, although he feared to die. But later on these
   expressions seemed unreal and affected to him, and he withdrew them in
   his Retractations. [150] You see how sensitive that great mind was to
   unreality or affectation. Assuredly straightforward honesty and
   sincerity in speech is a great beauty in the Christian life. "I said I
   will take heed to my ways, that I offend not in my tongue." [151] "Set
   a watch, O Lord, before my mouth, and keep the door of my lips." [152]

   It was a saying of S. Louis, that one should contradict nobody, unless
   there was sin or harm in consenting; and that in order to avoid
   contention and dispute. At any rate, when it is necessary to contradict
   anybody, or to assert one's own opinion, it should be done gently and
   considerately, without irritation or vehemence. Indeed, we gain nothing
   by sharpness or petulance.

   The silence, so much commended by wise men of old, does not refer so
   much to a literal use of few words, as to not using many useless words.
   On this score, we must look less to the quantity than the quality, and,
   as it seems to me, our aim should be to avoid both extremes. An
   excessive reserve and stiffness, which stands aloof from familiar
   friendly conversation, is untrusting, and implies a certain sort of
   contemptuous pride; while an incessant chatter and babble, leaving no
   opportunity for others to put in their word, is frivolous and
   troublesome.

   S. Louis objected to private confidences and whisperings in society,
   especially at table, lest suspicion should be aroused that scandal was
   being repeated. "Those who have anything amusing or pleasant to say,"
   he argued, "should let everybody share the entertainment, but if they
   want to speak of important matters, they should wait a more suitable
   time."

   his soul were one soul in two bodies, and therefore my life was a

   I feared to die, lest he whom I had much loved should die

CHAPTER XXXI. Of Amusements and Recreations: what are allowable.

   WE must needs occasionally relax the mind, and the body requires some
   recreation also. Cassian relates how S. John the Evangelist was found
   by a certain hunter amusing himself by caressing a partridge, which sat
   upon his wrist. The hunter asked how a man of his mental powers could
   find time for so trifling an occupation. In reply, S. John asked why he
   did not always carry his bow strung? The man answered, Because, if
   always bent, the bow would lose its spring when really wanted. "Do not
   marvel then," the Apostle replied, "if I slacken my mental efforts from
   time to time, and recreate myself, in order to return more vigorously
   to contemplation." It is a great mistake to be so strict as to grudge
   any recreation either to others or one's self.

   Walking, harmless games, music, instrumental or vocal, field sports,
   etc., are such entirely lawful recreations that they need no rules
   beyond those of ordinary discretion, which keep every thing within due
   limits of time, place, and degree. So again games of skill, which
   exercise and strengthen body or mind, such as tennis, rackets, running
   at the ring, chess, and the like, are in themselves both lawful and
   good. Only one must avoid excess, either in the time given to them, or
   the amount of interest they absorb; for if too much time be given up to
   such things, they cease to be a recreation and become an occupation;
   and so far from resting and restoring mind or body, they have precisely
   the contrary effect. After five or six hours spent over chess, one's
   mind is spent and weary, and too long a time given to tennis results in
   physical exhaustion; or if people play for a high stake, they get
   anxious and discomposed, and such unimportant objects are unworthy of
   so much care and thought. But, above all, beware of setting your heart
   upon any of these things, for however lawful an amusement may be, it is
   wrong to give one's heart up to it. Not that I would not have you take
   pleasure in what you are doing,--it were no recreation else,--but I
   would not have you engrossed by it, or become eager or over fond of any
   of these things.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXXII. Of Forbidden Amusements.

   DICE, cards, and the like games of hazard, are not merely dangerous
   amusements, like dancing, but they are plainly bad and harmful, and
   therefore they are forbidden by the civil as by the ecclesiastical law.
   What harm is there in them? you ask. Such games are unreasonable:--the
   winner often has neither skill nor industry to boast of, which is
   contrary to reason. You reply that this is understood by those who
   play. But though that may prove that you are not wronging anybody, it
   does not prove that the game is in accordance with reason, as victory
   ought to be the reward of skill or labour, which it cannot be in mere
   games of chance. Moreover, though such games may be called a
   recreation, and are intended as such, they are practically an intense
   occupation. Is it not an occupation, when a man's mind is kept on the
   stretch of close attention, and disturbed by endless anxieties, fears
   and agitations? Who exercises a more dismal, painful attention than the
   gambler? No one must speak or laugh,--if you do but cough you will
   annoy him and his companions. The only pleasure in gambling is to win,
   and this cannot be a satisfactory pleasure, since it can only be
   enjoyed at the expense of your antagonist. Once, when he was very ill,
   S. Louis heard that his brother the Comte d'Anjou and Messire Gautier
   de Nemours were gambling, and in spite of his weakness the King
   tottered into the room where they were, and threw dice and money and
   everything out of the window, in great indignation. And the pure and
   pious Sara, in her appeal to God, declared that she had never had
   dealings with gamblers. [153]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [153] It is not very clear what S. Francis means by this. In the
   English version, Sara only says, "Thou knowest, Lord . . . that I never
   polluted my name, nor the name of my father" (Tobit iii. 15). In the
   Vulgate the words are "Numquam cum ludentibus miscui me; neque cum his,
   qui in levitate ambulant, participem me praebui" (iii. 17).
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXXIII. Of Balls, and other Lawful but Dangerous Amusements.

   DANCES and balls are things in themselves indifferent, but the
   circumstances ordinarily surrounding them have so generally an evil
   tendency, that they become full of temptation and danger. The time of
   night at which they take place is in itself conducive to harm, both as
   the season when people's nerves are most excited and open to evil
   impressions; and because, after being up the greater part of the night,
   they spend the mornings afterwards in sleep, and lose the best part of
   the day for God's Service. It is a senseless thing to turn day into
   night, light into darkness, and to exchange good works for mere
   trifling follies. Moreover, those who frequent balls almost inevitably
   foster their Vanity, and vanity is very conducive to unholy desires and
   dangerous attachments.

   I am inclined to say about balls what doctors say of certain articles
   of food, such as mushrooms and the like--the best are not good for
   much; but if eat them you must, at least mind that they are properly
   cooked. So, if circumstances over which you have no control take you
   into such places, be watchful how you prepare to enter them. Let the
   dish be seasoned with moderation, dignity and good intentions. The
   doctors say (still referring to the mushrooms), eat sparingly of them,
   and that but seldom, for, however well dressed, an excess is harmful.
   So dance but little, and that rarely, my daughter, lest you run the
   risk of growing over fond of the amusement.

   Pliny says that mushrooms, from their porous, spongy nature, easily
   imbibe meretricious matter, so that if they are near a serpent, they
   are infected by its poison. So balls and similar gatherings are wont to
   attract all that is bad and vicious; all the quarrels, envyings,
   slanders, and indiscreet tendencies of a place will be found collected
   in the ballroom. While people's bodily pores are opened by the exercise
   of dancing, the heart's pores will be also opened by excitement, and if
   any serpent be at hand to whisper foolish words of levity or impurity,
   to insinuate unworthy thoughts and desires, the ears which listen are
   more than prepared to receive the contagion.

   Believe me, my daughter, these frivolous amusements are for the most
   part dangerous; they dissipate the spirit of devotion, enervate the
   mind, check true charity, and arouse a multitude of evil inclinations
   in the soul, and therefore I would have you very reticent in their use.

   To return to the medical simile;--it is said that after eating
   mushrooms you should drink some good wine. So after frequenting balls
   you should frame pious thoughts which may counteract the dangerous
   impressions made by such empty pleasures on your heart. Bethink you,
   then--1. That while you were dancing, souls were groaning in hell by
   reason of sins committed when similarly occupied, or in consequence
   thereof.

   2. Remember how, at the selfsame time, many religious and other devout
   persons were kneeling before God, praying or praising Him. Was not
   their time better spent than yours?

   3. Again, while you were dancing, many a soul has passed away amid
   sharp sufferings; thousands and tens of thousands were lying all the
   while on beds of anguish, some perhaps untended, unconsoled, in fevers,
   and all manner of painful diseases. Will you not rouse yourself to a
   sense of pity for them? At all events, remember that a day will come
   when you in your turn will lie on your bed of sickness, while others
   dance and make merry.

   4. Bethink you that our Dear Lord, Our Lady, all the Angels and Saints,
   saw all that was passing. Did they not look on with sorrowful pity,
   while your heart, capable of better things, was engrossed with such
   mere follies?

   5. And while you were dancing time passed by, and death drew nearer.
   Trifle as you may, the awful dance of death [154] must come, the real
   pastime of men, since therein they must, whether they will or no, pass
   from time to an eternity of good or evil. If you think of the matter
   quietly, and as in God's Sight, He will suggest many a like thought,
   which will steady and strengthen your heart.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [154] S. Francis de Sales doubtless had in his thoughts the then common
   pictorial representations of the Dance of Death, with which (although
   to our own modern ideas there would be almost irreverence if
   reproduced) we are familiar through Holbein's celebrated Dance, and
   others. The old covered bridge at Lucerne is one of the most striking
   illustrations.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXXIV. When to use such Amusements rightly.

   IF you would dance or play rightly, it must be done as a recreation,
   not as a pursuit, for a brief space of time, not so as make you unfit
   for other things, and even then but seldom. If it is a constant habit,
   recreation turns into occupation. You will ask when it is right to
   dance or play? The occasions on which it is right to play at
   questionable games are rare; ordinary games and dances may be indulged
   in more frequently. But let your rule be to do so chiefly when
   courteous consideration for others among whom you are thrown requires
   it, subject to prudence and discretion; for consideration towards
   others often sanctions things indifferent or dangerous, and turns them
   to good, taking away what is evil. Thus certain games of chance, bad in
   themselves, cease to be so to you, if you join in them merely out of a
   due courtesy. I have been much comforted by reading in the Life of S.
   Carlo Borromeo, how he joined in certain things to please the Swiss,
   concerning which ordinarily he was very strict; as also how S. Ignatius
   Loyola, when asked to play, did so. As to S. Elizabeth of Hungary, she
   both played and danced occasionally, when in society, without thereby
   hindering her devotion, which was so firmly rooted that, like the rocks
   of a mountain lake, it stood unmoved amid the waves and storms of pomp
   and vanity which it encountered.

   Great fires are fanned by the wind, but a little one is soon
   extinguished if left without shelter.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXXV. We must be Faithful in Things Great and Small.

   THE Bridegroom of the Canticles says that the Bride has ravished His
   heart with "one of her eyes, one lock of her hair." [155] In all the
   human body no part is nobler either in mechanism or activity than the
   eye, none more unimportant than the hair. And so the Divine Bridegroom
   makes us to know that He accepts not only the great works of devout
   people, but every poor and lowly offering too; and that they who would
   serve Him acceptably must give heed not only to lofty and important
   matters, but to things mean and little, since by both alike we may win
   His Heart and Love.

   Be ready then, my child, to bear great afflictions for your Lord, even
   to martyrdom itself; resolve to give up to Him all that you hold most
   precious, if He should require it of you;--father, mother, husband,
   wife, or child; the light of your eyes; your very life; for all such
   offering your heart should be ready. But so long as God's Providence
   does not send you these great and heavy afflictions; so long as He does
   not ask your eyes, at least give Him your hair. I mean, take patiently
   the petty annoyances, the trifling discomforts, the unimportant losses
   which come upon all of us daily; for by means of these little matters,
   lovingly and freely accepted, you will give Him your whole heart, and
   win His. I mean the acts of daily forbearance, the headache, or
   toothache, or heavy cold; the tiresome peculiarities of husband or
   wife, the broken glass, the loss of a ring, a handkerchief, a glove;
   the sneer of a neighbour, the effort of going to bed early in order to
   rise early for prayer or Communion, the little shyness some people feel
   in openly performing religious duties; and be sure that all of these
   sufferings, small as they are, if accepted lovingly, are most pleasing
   to God's Goodness, Which has promised a whole ocean of happiness to His
   children in return for one cup of cold water. And, moreover, inasmuch
   as these occasions are for ever arising, they give us a fertile field
   for gathering in spiritual riches, if only we will use them rightly.

   When I read in the Life of S. Catherine of Sienna of her ecstasies and
   visions, her wise sayings and teaching, I do not doubt but that she
   "ravished" her Bridegroom's heart with this eye of contemplation; but I
   must own that I behold her with no less delight in her father's
   kitchen, kindling the fire, turning the spit, baking the bread, cooking
   the dinner, and doing all the most menial offices in a loving spirit
   which looked through all things straight to God. Nor do I prize the
   lowly meditations she was wont to make while so humbly employed less
   than the ecstasies with which she was favoured at other times, probably
   as a reward for this very humility and lowliness. Her meditations would
   take the shape of imagining that all she prepared for her father was
   prepared for Our Lord, as by Martha; her mother was a symbol to her of
   Our Lady, her brothers of the Apostles, and thus she mentally
   ministered to all the Heavenly Courts, fulfilling her humble
   ministrations with an exceeding sweetness, because she saw God's Will
   in each. Let this example, my daughter, teach you how important it is
   to dedicate all we do, however trifling, to His service. And to this
   end I earnestly counsel you to imitate that "virtuous woman" whom King
   Solomon lauds, [156] who "layeth her hands" to all that is good and
   noble, and yet at the same time to the spindle and distaff. Do you seek
   the higher things, such as prayer and meditation, the Sacraments
   leading souls to God and kindling good thoughts in them, in a word, by
   all manner of good works according to your vocation; but meanwhile do
   not neglect your spindle and distaff. I mean, cultivate those lowly
   virtues which spring like flowers round the foot of the Cross, such as
   ministering to the poor and sick, family cares, and the duties arising
   therefrom, and practical diligence and activity; and amid all these
   things cultivate such spiritual thoughts as S. Catherine intermingled
   with her work.

   Great occasions for serving God come seldom, but little ones surround
   us daily; and our Lord Himself has told us that "he that is faithful in
   that which is least is faithful also in much." [157] If you do all in
   God's Name, all you do will be well done, whether you eat, drink or
   sleep, whether you amuse yourself or turn the spit, so long as you do
   all wisely, you will gain greatly as in God's Sight, doing all because
   He would have you do it.

CHAPTER XXXVI. Of a Well-Balanced, Reasonable Mind.

   REASON is the special characteristic of man, and yet it is a rare thing
   to find really reasonable men, all the more that self-love hinders
   reason, and beguiles us insensibly into all manner of trifling, but yet
   dangerous acts of injustice and untruth, which, like the little foxes
   in the Canticles, [158] spoil our vines, while, just because they are
   trifling, people pay no attention to them, and because they are
   numerous, they do infinite harm. Let me give some instances of what I
   mean.

   We find fault with our neighbour very readily for a small matter, while
   we pass over great things in ourselves. We strive to sell dear and buy
   cheap. We are eager to deal out strict justice to others, but to obtain
   indulgence for ourselves. We expect a good construction to be put on
   all we say, but we are sensitive and critical as to our neighbour's
   words. We expect him to let us have whatever we want for money, when it
   would be more reasonable to let him keep that which is his, if he
   desires to do so, and leave us to keep our gold. We are vexed with him
   because he will not accommodate us, while perhaps he has better reason
   to be vexed with us for wanting to disturb him. If we have a liking for
   any one particular thing, we despise all else, and reject whatever does
   not precisely suit our taste. If some inferior is unacceptable to us,
   or we have once caught him in error, he is sure to be wrong in our eyes
   whatever he may do, and we are for ever thwarting, or looking coldly on
   him, while, on the other hand, some one who happens to please us is
   sure to be right. Sometimes even parents show unfair preference for a
   child endowed with personal gifts over one afflicted with some physical
   imperfection. We put the rich before the poor, although they may have
   less claim, and be less worthy; we even give preference to well-dressed
   people. We are strict in exacting our own rights, but expect others to
   be yielding as to theirs;--we complain freely of our neighbours, but we
   do not like them to make any complaints of us. Whatever we do for them
   appears very great in our sight, but what they do for us counts as
   nothing. In a word, we are like the Paphlagonian partridge, which has
   two hearts; for we have a very tender, pitiful, easy heart towards
   ourselves, and one which is hard, harsh and strict towards our
   neighbour. We have two scales, one wherein to measure our own goods to
   the best advantage, and the other to weigh our neighbours' to the
   worst. Holy Scripture tells us that lying lips are an abomination unto
   the Lord, [159] and the double heart, with one measure whereby to
   receive, and another to give, is also abominable in His Sight.

   Be just and fair in all you do. Always put yourself in your neighbour's
   place, and put him into yours, and then you will judge fairly. Sell as
   you would buy, and buy as you would sell, and your buying and selling
   will alike be honest. These little dishonesties seem unimportant,
   because we are not obliged to make restitution, and we have, after all,
   only taken that which we might demand according to the strict letter of
   the law; but, nevertheless, they are sins against right and charity,
   and are mere trickery, greatly needing correction--nor does any one
   ever lose by being generous, noble-hearted and courteous. Be sure then
   often to examine your dealings with your neighbour, whether your heart
   is right towards him, as you would have his towards you, were things
   reversed--this is the true test of reason. When Trajan was blamed by
   his confidential friends for making the Imperial presence too
   accessible, he replied, "Does it not behove me to strive to be such an
   emperor towards my subjects as I should wish to meet with were I a
   subject?"

CHAPTER XXXVII. Of Wishes.

   EVERYBODY grants that we must guard against the desire for evil things,
   since evil desires make evil men. But I say yet further, my daughter,
   do not desire dangerous things, such as balls or pleasures, office or
   honour, visions or ecstacies. Do not long after things afar off; such,
   I mean, as cannot happen till a distant time, as some do who by this
   means wear themselves out and expend their energies uselessly,
   fostering a dangerous spirit of distraction. If a young man gives way
   to overweening longings for an employment he cannot obtain yet a while,
   what good will it do him? If a married woman sets her heart on becoming
   a religious, or if I crave to buy my neighbour's estate, he not being
   willing to sell it, is it not mere waste of time? If, when sick, I am
   restlessly anxious to preach or celebrate, to visit other sick people,
   or generally to do work befitting the strong, is it not an unprofitable
   desire, inasmuch as I have no power to fulfil it? and meanwhile these
   useless wishes take the place of such as I ought to have,--namely, to
   be patient, resigned, self-denying, obedient, gentle under
   suffering,--which are what God requires of me under the circumstances.
   We are too apt to be like a sickly woman, craving ripe cherries in
   autumn and grapes in spring. I can never think it well for one whose
   vocation is clear to waste time in wishing for some different manner of
   life than that which is adapted to his duty, or practices unsuitable to
   his present position--it is mere idling, and will make him slack in his
   needful work. If I long after a Carthusian solitude, I am losing my
   time, and such longing usurps the place of that which I ought to
   entertain--to fulfil my actual duties rightly. No indeed, I would not
   even have people wish for more wit or better judgment, for such desires
   are frivolous, and take the place of the wish every one ought to
   possess of improving what he has. We ought not to desire ways of
   serving God which He does not open to us, but rather desire to use what
   we have rightly. Of course I mean by this, real earnest desires, not
   common superficial wishes, which do no harm if not too frequently
   indulged.

   Do not desire crosses, unless you have borne those already laid upon
   you well--it is an abuse to long after martyrdom while unable to bear
   an insult patiently. The Enemy of souls often inspires men with ardent
   desires for unattainable things, in order to divert their attention
   from present duties, which would be profitable however trifling in
   themselves. We are apt to fight African monsters in imagination, while
   we let very petty foes vanquish us in reality for want of due heed.

   Do not desire temptations, that is temerity, but prepare your heart to
   meet them bravely, and to resist them when they come.

   Too great variety and quantity of food loads the stomach, and
   (especially when it is weakly) spoils the digestion. Do not overload
   your soul with innumerable longings, either worldly, for that were
   destruction,--or even spiritual, for these only cumber you. When the
   soul is purged of the evil humours of sin, it experiences a ravenous
   hunger for spiritual things, and sets to work as one famished at all
   manner of spiritual exercises;--mortification, penitence, humility,
   charity, prayer. Doubtless such an appetite is a good sign, but it
   behoves you to reflect whether you are able to digest all that you fain
   would eat. Make rather a selection from all these desires, under the
   guidance of your spiritual father, of such as you are able to perform,
   and then use them as perfectly as you are able. When you have done
   this, God will send you more, to be fulfilled in their turn, and so you
   will not waste time in unprofitable wishes. Not that I would have you
   lose any good desires, but rather treat them methodically, putting them
   aside in one corner of your heart till due time comes, while you carry
   out such as are ripe for action. And this counsel I give to worldly
   people as well as those who are spiritual, for without heeding it no
   one can avoid anxiety and over-eagerness.

CHAPTER XXXVIII. Counsels to Married People.

   MARRIAGE is a great Sacrament both in Jesus Christ and His Church, and
   one to be honoured to all, by all and in all. To all, for even those
   who do not enter upon it should honour it in all humility. By all, for
   it is holy alike to poor as to rich. In all, for its origin, its end,
   its form and matter are holy. It is the nursery of Christianity, whence
   the earth is peopled with faithful, till the number of the elect in
   Heaven be perfected; so that respect for the marriage tie is
   exceedingly important to the commonwealth, of which it is the source
   and supply.

   Would to God that His Dear Son were bidden to all weddings as to that
   of Cana! Truly then the wine of consolation and blessing would never be
   lacking; for if these are often so wanting, it is because too
   frequently now men summon Adonis instead of our Lord, and Venus rather
   than Our Lady. He who desires that the young of his flock should be
   like Jacob's, fair and ring-straked, must set fair objects before their
   eyes; and he who would find a blessing in his marriage, must ponder the
   holiness and dignity of this Sacrament, instead of which too often
   weddings become a season of mere feasting and disorder.

   Above all, I would exhort all married people to seek that mutual love
   so commended to them by the Holy Spirit in the Bible. It is little to
   bid you love one another with a mutual love,---turtle-doves do that; or
   with human love,--the heathen cherished such love as that. But I say to
   you in the Apostle's words: "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ
   also loved the Church. Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands as
   unto the Lord." [160] It was God Who brought Eve to our first father
   Adam, and gave her to him to wife; and even so, my friends, it is God's
   Invisible Hand Which binds you in the sacred bonds of marriage; it is
   He Who gives you one to the other, therefore cherish one another with a
   holy, sacred, heavenly love.

   The first effect of this love is the indissoluble union of your hearts.
   If you glue together two pieces of deal, provided that the glue be
   strong, their union will be so close that the stick will break more
   easily in any other part than where it is joined. Now God unites
   husband and wife so closely in Himself, that it should be easier to
   sunder soul from body than husband from wife; nor is this union to be
   considered as mainly of the body, but yet more a union of the heart,
   its affections and love.

   The second effect of this love should be an inviolable fidelity to one
   another. In olden times finger-rings were wont to be graven as seals.
   We read of it in Holy Scripture, and this explains the meaning of the
   marriage ceremony, when the Church, by the hand of her priest, blesses
   a ring, and gives it first to the man in token that she sets a seal on
   his heart by this Sacrament, so that no thought of any other woman may
   ever enter therein so long as she, who now is given to him, shall live.
   Then the bridegroom places the ring on the bride's hand, so that she in
   her turn may know that she must never conceive any affection in her
   heart for any other man so long as he shall live, who is now given to
   her by our Lord Himself.

   The third end of marriage is the birth and bringing up of children. And
   herein, O ye married people! are you greatly honoured, in that God,
   willing to multiply souls to bless and praise Him to all Eternity, He
   associates you with Himself in this His work, by the production of
   bodies into which, like dew from Heaven, He infuses the souls He
   creates as well as the bodies into which they enter.

   Therefore, husbands, do you preserve a tender, constant, hearty love
   for your wives. It was that the wife might be loved heartily and
   tenderly that woman was taken from the side nearest Adam's heart. No
   failings or infirmities, bodily or mental, in your wife should ever
   excite any kind of dislike in you, but rather a loving, tender
   compassion; and that because God has made her dependent on you, and
   bound to defer to and obey you; and that while she is meant to be your
   helpmeet, you are her superior and her head. And on your part, wives,
   do you love the husbands God has given you tenderly, heartily, but with
   a reverential, confiding love, for God has made the man to have the
   predominance, and to be the stronger; and He wills the woman to depend
   upon him,--bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh,--taking her from out
   the ribs of the man, to show that she must be subject to his guidance.
   All Holy Scripture enjoins this subjection, which nevertheless is not
   grievous; and the same Holy Scripture, while it bids you accept it
   lovingly, bids your husband to use his superiority with great
   tenderness, lovingkindness, and gentleness. "Husbands, dwell with your
   wives according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife as unto the
   weaker vessel." [161]

   But while you seek diligently to foster this mutual love, give good
   heed that it do not turn to any manner of jealousy. Just as the worm is
   often hatched in the sweetest and ripest apple, so too often jealousy
   springs up in the most warm and loving hearts, defiling and ruining
   them, and if it is allowed to take root, it will produce dissension,
   quarrels, and separation. Of a truth, jealousy never arises where love
   is built up on true virtue, and therefore it is a sure sign of an
   earthly, sensual love, in which mistrust and inconstancy is soon
   infused. It is a sorry kind of friendship which seeks to strengthen
   itself by jealousy; for though jealousy may be a sign of strong, hot
   friendship, it is certainly no sign of a good, pure, perfect
   attachment; and that because perfect love implies absolute trust in the
   person loved, whereas jealousy implies uncertainty.

   If you, husbands, would have your wives faithful, be it yours to set
   them the example. "How have you the face to exact purity from your
   wives," asks S. Gregory Nazianzen, "if you yourself live an impure
   life? or how can you require that which you do not give in return? If
   you would have them chaste, let your own conduct to them be chaste. S.
   Paul bids you possess your vessel in sanctification; but if, on the
   contrary, you teach them evil, no wonder that they dishonour you. And
   ye, O women! whose honour is inseparable from modesty and purity,
   preserve it jealously, and never allow the smallest speck to soil the
   whiteness of your reputation."

   Shrink sensitively from the veriest trifles which can touch it; never
   permit any gallantries whatsoever. Suspect any who presume to flatter
   your beauty or grace, for when men praise wares they cannot purchase
   they are often tempted to steal; and if any one should dare to speak in
   disparagement of your husband, show that you are irrecoverably
   offended, for it is plain that he not only seeks your fall, but he
   counts you as half fallen, since the bargain with the new-comer is half
   made when one is disgusted with the first merchant.

   Ladies both in ancient and modern times have worn pearls in their ears,
   for the sake (so says Pliny) of hearing them tinkle against each other.
   But remembering how that friend of God, Isaac, sent earrings as first
   pledges of his love to the chaste Rebecca, I look upon this mystic
   ornament as signifying that the first claim a husband has over his
   wife, and one which she ought most faithfully to keep for him, is her
   ear; so that no evil word or rumour enter therein, and nought be heard
   save the pleasant sound of true and pure words, which are represented
   by the choice pearls of the Gospel. Never forget that souls are
   poisoned through the ear as much as bodies through the mouth.

   Love and faithfulness lead to familiarity and confidence, and Saints
   have abounded in tender caresses. Isaac and Rebecca, the type of chaste
   married life, indulged in such caresses, as to convince Abimelech that
   they must be husband and wife. The great S. Louis, strict as he was to
   himself, was so tender towards his wife, that some were ready to blame
   him for it; although in truth he rather deserved praise for subjecting
   his lofty, martial mind to the little details of conjugal love. Such
   minor matters will not suffice to knit hearts, but they tend to draw
   them closer, and promote mutual happiness.

   Before giving birth to S. Augustine, S. Monica offered him repeatedly
   to God's Glory, as he himself tells us; and it is a good lesson for
   Christian women how to offer the fruit of their womb to God, Who
   accepts the free oblations of loving hearts, and promotes the desires
   of such faithful mothers: witness Samuel, S. Thomas Aquinas, S. Andrea
   di Fiesole, and others. [162] S. Bernard's mother, worthy of such a
   son, was wont to take her new-born babes in her arms to offer them to
   Jesus Christ, thenceforward loving them with a reverential love, as a
   sacred deposit from God; and so entirely was her offering accepted,
   that all her seven children became Saints. [163] And when children
   begin to use their reason, fathers and mothers should take great pains
   to fill their hearts with the fear of God. This the good Queen Blanche
   did most earnestly by S. Louis, her son: witness her oft-repeated
   words, "My son, I would sooner see you die than guilty of a mortal
   sin;" words which sank so deeply into the saintly monarch's heart, that
   he himself said there was no day on which they did not recur to his
   mind, and strengthen him in treading God's ways.

   We call races and generations Houses; and the Hebrews were wont to
   speak of the birth of children as "the building up of the house;" as it
   is written of the Jewish midwives in Egypt, that the Lord "made them
   houses;" [164] whereby we learn that a good house is not reared so much
   by the accumulation of worldly goods, as by the bringing up of children
   in the ways of holiness and of God; and to this end no labour or
   trouble must be spared, for children are the crown of their parents.
   [165] Thus it was that S. Monica stedfastly withstood S. Augustine's
   evil propensities, and, following him across sea and land, he became
   more truly the child of her tears in the conversion of his soul, than
   the son of her body in his natural birth.

   S. Paul assigns the charge of the household to the woman; and
   consequently some hold that the devotion of the family depends more
   upon the wife than the husband, who is more frequently absent, and has
   less influence in the house. Certainly King Solomon, in the Book of
   Proverbs, refers all household prosperity to the care and industry of
   that virtuous woman whom he describes. [166]

   We read in Genesis that Isaac "entreated the Lord for his wife, because
   she was barren;" [167] or as the Hebrews read it, he prayed "over
   against" her,--on opposite sides of the place of prayer,--and his
   prayer was granted. That is the most fruitful union between husband and
   wife which is founded in devotion, to which they should mutually
   stimulate one another. There are certain fruits, like the quince, of so
   bitter a quality, that they are scarcely eatable, save when preserved;
   while others again, like cherries and apricots, are so delicate and
   soft, that they can only be kept by the same treatment. So the wife
   must seek that her husband be sweetened with the sugar of devotion, for
   man without religion is a rude, rough animal; and the husband will
   desire to see his wife devout, as without it her frailty and weakness
   are liable to tarnish and injury. S. Paul says that "the unbelieving
   husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is
   sanctified by the husband;" [168] because in so close a tie one may
   easily draw the other to what is good. And how great is the blessing on
   those faithful husbands and wives who confirm one another continually
   in the Fear of the Lord!

   Moreover, each should have such forbearance towards the other, that
   they never grow angry, or fall into discussion and argument. The bee
   will not dwell in a spot where there is much loud noise or shouting, or
   echo; neither will God's Holy Spirit dwell in a household where
   altercation and tumult, arguing and quarrelling, disturb the peace.

   S. Gregory Nazianzen says that in his time married people were wont to
   celebrate the anniversary of their wedding, and it is a custom I should
   greatly approve, provided it were not a merely secular celebration; but
   if husbands and wives would go on that day to Confession and Communion,
   and commend their married life specially to God, renewing their
   resolution to promote mutual good by increased love and faithfulness,
   and thus take breath, so to say, and gather new vigour from the Lord to
   go on stedfastly in their vocation.

CHAPTER XXXIX. The Sanctity of the Marriage Bed.

   THE marriage bed should be undefiled, as the Apostle tells us, [169]
   i.e. pure, as it was when it was first instituted in the earthly
   Paradise, wherein no unruly desires or impure thought might enter. All
   that is merely earthly must be treated as means to fulfil the end God
   sets before His creatures. Thus we eat in order to preserve life,
   moderately, voluntarily, and without seeking an undue, unworthy
   satisfaction therefrom. "The time is short," says S. Paul; "it
   remaineth that both they that have wives be as though they had not, and
   they that use this world, as not abusing it." [170]

   Let every one, then, use this world according to his vocation, but so
   as not to entangle himself with its love, that he may be as free and
   ready to serve God as though he used it not. S. Augustine says that it
   is the great fault of men to want to enjoy things which they are only
   meant to use, and to use those which they are only meant to enjoy. We
   ought to enjoy spiritual things, and only use those which are material;
   but when we turn the use of these latter into enjoyment, the reasonable
   soul becomes degraded to a mere brutish level.

CHAPTER XL. Counsels to Widows.

   SAINT PAUL teaches us all in the person of S. Timothy when he says,
   "Honour widows that are widows indeed." [171] Now to be "a widow
   indeed" it is necessary:--

   1. That the widow be one not in body only, but in heart also; that is
   to say, that she be fixed in an unalterable resolution to continue in
   her widowhood Those widows who are but waiting the opportunity of
   marrying again are only widowed in externals, while in will they have
   already laid aside their loneliness. If the "widow indeed" chooses to
   confirm her widowhood by offering herself by a vow to God, she will
   adorn that widowhood, and make her resolution doubly sure, for the
   remembrance that she cannot break her vow without danger of forfeiting
   Paradise, will make her so watchful over herself, that a great barrier
   will be raised against all kind of temptation that may assail her. S.
   Augustine strongly recommends Christian widows to take this vow, and
   the learned Origen goes yet further, for he advises married women to
   take a vow of chastity in the event of losing their husbands, so that
   amid the joys of married life they may yet have a share in the merits
   of a chaste widowhood. Vows render the actions performed under their
   shelter more acceptable to God, strengthen us to perform good works,
   and help us to devote to Him not merely those good works which are, so
   to say, the fruits of a holy will, but to consecrate that will itself;
   the source of all we do, to Him. By ordinary chastity we offer our body
   to God, retaining the power to return to sensual pleasure; but the vow
   of chastity is an absolute and irrevocable gift to Him, without any
   power to recall it, thereby making ourselves the happy slaves of Him
   Whose service is to be preferred to royal power. And as I greatly
   approve the counsels of the two venerable Fathers I have named, I would
   have such persons as are so favoured as to wish to embrace them, do so
   prudently, and in a holy, stedfast spirit, after careful examination of
   their own courage, having asked heavenly guidance, and taken the advice
   of some discreet and pious director, and then all will be profitably
   done.

   2. Further, all such renunciation of second marriage must be done with
   a single heart, in order to fix the affections more entirely on God,
   and to seek a more complete union with Him. For if the widow retains
   her widowhood merely to enrich her children, or for any other worldly
   motive, she may receive the praise of men, but not that of God,
   inasmuch as nothing is worthy of His Approbation save that which is
   done for His Sake. Moreover, she who would be a widow indeed must be
   voluntarily cut off from all worldly delights. "She that liveth in
   pleasure is dead while she liveth," S. Paul says. [172] A widow who
   seeks to be admired and followed and flattered, who frequents balls and
   parties, who takes pleasure in dressing, perfuming and adorning
   herself, may be a widow in the body, but she is dead as to the soul.
   What does it matter, I pray you, whether the flag of Adonis and his
   profane love be made of white feathers or a net of crape? Nay,
   sometimes there is a conscious vanity in that black is the most
   becoming dress; and she who thereby endeavours to captivate men, and
   who lives in empty pleasure, is "dead while she liveth," and is a mere
   mockery of widowhood.

   "The time of retrenchment is come, the voice of the turtle is heard in
   our land." [173] Retrenchment of worldly superfluity is required of
   whosoever would lead a devout life, but above all, it is needful for
   the widow indeed, who mourns the loss of her husband like a true
   turtle-dove. When Naomi returned from Moab to Bethlehem, those that had
   known her in her earlier and brighter days were moved, and said, "Is
   this Naomi? And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi (which means
   beautiful and agreeable), call me Mara, for the Almighty hath dealt
   very bitterly with me. I went out full, and the Lord hath brought me
   home again empty." [174] Even so the devout widow will not desire to be
   called or counted beautiful or agreeable, asking no more than to be
   that which God wills,--lowly and abject in His Eyes.

   The lamp which is fed with aromatic oil sends forth a yet sweeter odour
   when it is extinguished; and so those women whose married love was true
   and pure, give out a stronger perfume of virtue and chastity when their
   light (that is, their husband) is extinguished by death. Love for a
   husband while living is a common matter enough among women, but to love
   him so deeply as to refuse to take another after his death, is a kind
   of love peculiar to her who is a widow indeed. Hope in God, while
   resting on a husband, is not so rare, but to hope in Him, when left
   alone and desolate, is a very gracious and worthy thing. And thus it is
   that widowhood becomes a test of the perfection of the virtues
   displayed by a woman in her married life.

   The widow who has children requiring her care and guidance, above all
   in what pertains to their souls and the shaping of their lives, cannot
   and ought not on any wise to forsake them. S. Paul teaches this
   emphatically, and says that those who "provide not for their own, and
   specially for those of their own house, are worse than an infidel;"
   [175] but if her children do not need her care, then the widow should
   gather together all her affections and thoughts, in order to devote
   them more wholly to making progress in the love of God. If there is no
   call obliging her in conscience to attend to external secular matters
   (legal or other), I should advise her to leave them all alone, and to
   manage her affairs as quietly and peacefully as may be, even if such a
   course does not seem the most profitable. The fruit of disputes and
   lawsuits must be very great indeed before it can be compared in worth
   to the blessing of holy peace; not to say that those legal
   entanglements and the like are essentially distracting, and often open
   the way for enemies who sully the purity of a heart which should be
   solely devoted to God.

   Prayer should be the widow's chief occupation: she has no love left
   save for God,--she should scarce have ought to say to any save God; and
   as iron, which is restrained from yielding to the attraction of the
   magnet when a diamond is near, darts instantly towards it so soon as
   the diamond is removed, so the widow's heart, which could not rise up
   wholly to God, or simply follow the leadings of His Heavenly Love
   during her husband's life, finds itself set free, when he is dead, to
   give itself entirely to Him, and cries out, with the Bride in the
   Canticles, "Draw me, I will run after Thee." [176] I will be wholly
   Thine, and seek nothing save the "savour of Thy good ointments."

   A devout widow should chiefly seek to cultivate the graces of perfect
   modesty, renouncing all honours, rank, title, society, and the like
   vanities; she should be diligent in ministering to the poor and sick,
   comforting the afflicted, leading the young to a life of devotion,
   studying herself to be a perfect model of virtue to younger women.
   Necessity and simplicity should be the adornment of her garb, humility
   and charity of her actions, simplicity and kindliness of her words,
   modesty and purity of her eyes,--Jesus Christ Crucified the only Love
   of her heart.

   Briefly, the true widow abides in the Church as a little March violet,
   [177] shedding forth an exquisite sweetness through the perfume of her
   devotion, ever concealing herself beneath the ample leaves of her
   heart's lowliness, while her subdued colouring indicates her
   mortification. She dwells in waste, uncultivated places, because she
   shrinks from the world's intercourse, and seeks to shelter her heart
   from the glare with which earthly longings, whether of honours, wealth,
   or love itself, might dazzle her. "Blessed is she if she so abide,"
   says the holy Apostle. [178]

   Much more could I say on this subject, but suffice it to bid her who
   seeks to be a widow indeed, read S. Jerome's striking Letters to
   Salvia, and the other noble ladies who rejoiced in being the spiritual
   children of such a Father. Nothing can be said more, unless it be to
   warn the widow indeed not to condemn or even censure those who do
   resume the married life, for there are cases in which God orders it
   thus to His Own greater Glory. We must ever bear in mind the ancient
   teaching, that in Heaven virgins, wives, and widows will know no
   difference, save that which their true hearts' humility assigns them.

CHAPTER XLI. One Word to Maidens.

   O YE virgins, I have but a word to say to you. If you look to married
   life in this life, guard your first love jealously for your husband. It
   seems to me a miserable fraud to give a husband a worn-out heart, whose
   love has been frittered away and despoiled of its first bloom instead
   of a true, whole-hearted love. But if you are happily called to be the
   chaste and holy bride of spiritual nuptials, and purpose to live a life
   of virginity, then in Christ's Name I bid you keep all your purest,
   most sensitive love for your Heavenly Bridegroom, Who, being Very
   Purity Himself, has a special love for purity; Him to Whom the
   first-fruits of all good things are due, above all those of love.

   S. Jerome's Epistles will supply you with the needful counsels; and
   inasmuch as your state of life requires obedience, seek out a guide
   under whose direction you may wholly dedicate yourself, body and soul,
   to His Divine Majesty.

   PART IV. CONTAINING NEEDFUL COUNSELS CONCERNING SOME ORDINARY TEMPTATIONS.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER I. We must not trifle with the Words of Worldly Wisdom.

   DIRECTLY that your worldly friends perceive that you aim at leading a
   devout life, they will let loose endless shafts of mockery and
   misrepresentation upon you; the more malicious will attribute your
   change to hypocrisy, designing, or bigotry; they will affirm that the
   world having looked coldly upon you, failing its favour you turn to
   God; while your friends will make a series of what, from their point of
   view, are prudent and charitable remonstrances. They will tell you that
   you are growing morbid; that you will lose your worldly credit, and
   will make yourself unacceptable to the world; they will prognosticate
   your premature old age, the ruin of your material prosperity; they will
   tell you that in the world you must live as the world does; that you
   can be saved without all this fuss; and much more of the like nature.

   My daughter, all this is vain and foolish talk: these people have no
   real regard either for your bodily health or your material prosperity.
   "If ye were of the world," the Saviour has said, "the world would love
   his own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out
   of the world, therefore the world hateth you." [179]

   We have all seen men, and women too, pass the whole night, even several
   in succession, playing at chess or cards; and what can be a more
   dismal, unwholesome thing than that? But the world has not a word to
   say against it, and their friends are nowise troubled. But give up an
   hour to meditation, or get up rather earlier than usual to prepare for
   Holy Communion, and they will send for the doctor to cure you of
   hypochondria or jaundice! People spend every night for a month dancing,
   and no one will complain of being the worse; but if they keep the one
   watch of Christmas Eve, we shall hear of endless colds and maladies the
   next day! Is it not as plain as possible that the world is an unjust
   judge; indulgent and kindly to its own children, harsh and uncharitable
   to the children of God? We cannot stand well with the world save by
   renouncing His approval. It is not possible to satisfy the world's
   unreasonable demands: "John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor
   drinking wine; and ye say he hath a devil. The Son of Man is come
   eating and drinking, and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a
   winebibber, the friend of publicans and sinners." [180] Even so, my
   child, if we give in to the world, and laugh, dance, and play as it
   does, it will affect to be scandalized; if we refuse to do so, it will
   accuse us of being hypocritical or morbid. If we adorn ourselves after
   its fashion, it will put some evil construction on what we do; if we go
   in plain attire, it will accuse us of meanness; our cheerfulness will
   be called dissipation; our mortification dulness; and ever casting its
   evil eye upon us, nothing we can do will please it. It exaggerates our
   failings, and publishes them abroad as sins; it represents our venial
   sins as mortal, and our sins of infirmity as malicious. S. Paul says
   that charity is kind, but the world is unkind; charity thinks no evil,
   but the world thinks evil of every one, and if it cannot find fault
   with our actions, it is sure at least to impute bad motives to
   them,--whether the sheep be black or white, horned or no, the wolf will
   devour them if he can. Do what we will, the world must wage war upon
   us. If we spend any length of time in confession, it will speculate on
   what we have so much to say about! if we are brief, it will suggest
   that we are keeping back something! It spies out our every act, and at
   the most trifling angry word, sets us down as intolerable. Attention to
   business is avarice, meekness mere silliness; whereas the wrath of
   worldly people is to be reckoned as generosity, their avarice, economy,
   their mean deeds, honourable. There are always spiders at hand to spoil
   the honey-bee's comb.

   Let us leave the blind world to make as much noise as it may,--like a
   bat molesting the songbirds of day; let us be firm in our ways,
   unchangeable in our resolutions, and perseverance will be the test of
   our self-surrender to God, and our deliberate choice of the devout
   life.

   The planets and a wandering comet shine with much the same brightness,
   but the comet's is a passing blaze, which does not linger long, while
   the planets cease not to display their brightness. Even so hypocrisy
   and real goodness have much outward resemblance; but one is easily
   known from the other, inasmuch as hypocrisy is short-lived, and
   disperses like a mist, while real goodness is firm and abiding. There
   is no surer groundwork for the beginnings of a devout life than the
   endurance of misrepresentation and calumny, since thereby we escape the
   danger of vainglory and pride, which are like the midwives of Egypt,
   who were bidden by Pharaoh to kill the male children born to Israel
   directly after their birth. We are crucified to the world, and the
   world must be as crucified to us. It esteems us as fools, let us esteem
   it as mad.

CHAPTER II. The need of a Good Courage.

   HOWEVER much we may admire and crave for light, it is apt to dazzle our
   eyes when they have been long accustomed to darkness; and on first
   visiting a foreign country, we are sure to feel strange among its
   inhabitants, however kindly or courteous they may be. Even so, my
   child, your changed life may be attended with some inward discomfort,
   and you may feel some reaction of discouragement and weariness after
   you have taken a final farewell of the world and its follies. Should it
   be so, I pray you take it patiently, for it will not last,--it is
   merely the disturbance caused by novelty; and when it is gone by, you
   will abound in consolations. At first you may suffer somewhat under the
   loss what you enjoyed among your vain, frivolous companions; but would
   you forfeit the eternal gifts of God for such things as these? The
   empty amusements which have engrossed you hitherto may rise up
   attractively before your imagination, and strive to win you back to
   rest in them; but are you bold enough to give up a blessed eternity for
   such deceitful snares? Believe me, if you will but persevere you will
   not fail to enjoy a sweetness so real and satisfying, that you will be
   constrained to confess that the world has only gall to give as compared
   with this honey, and that one single day of devotion is worth more than
   a thousand years of worldly life.

   But you see before you the mountain of Christian perfection, which is
   very high, and you exclaim in fearfulness that you can never ascend it.
   Be of good cheer, my child. When the young bees first begin to live
   they are mere grubs, unable to hover over flowers, or to fly to the
   mountains, or even to the little hills where they might gather honey;
   but they are fed for a time with the honey laid up by their
   predecessors, and by degrees the grubs put forth their wings and grow
   strong, until they fly abroad and gather their harvest from all the
   country round. Now we are yet but as grubs in devotion, unable to fly
   at will, and attain the desired aim of Christian perfection; but if we
   begin to take shape through our desires and resolutions, our wings will
   gradually grow, and we may hope one day to become spiritual bees, able
   to fly. Meanwhile let us feed upon the honey left us in the teaching of
   so many holy men of old, praying God that He would grant us doves'
   wings, so that we may not only fly during this life, but find an
   abiding resting-place in Eternity.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER III. Of Temptations, and the difference between experiencing them and
consenting to them.

   PICTURE to yourself a young princess beloved of her husband, to whom
   some evil wretch should send a messenger to tempt her to infidelity.
   First, the messenger would bring forth his propositions. Secondly, the
   princess would either accept or reject the overtures. Thirdly, she
   would consent to them or refuse them. Even so, when Satan, the world,
   and the flesh look upon a soul espoused to the Son of God, they set
   temptations and suggestions before that soul, whereby--1. Sin is
   proposed to it. 2. Which proposals are either pleasing or displeasing
   to the soul. 3. The soul either consents, or rejects them. In other
   words, the three downward steps of temptation, delectation, and
   consent. And although the three steps may not always be so clearly
   defined as in this illustration, they are to be plainly traced in all
   great and serious sins.

   If we should undergo the temptation to every sin whatsoever during our
   whole life, that would not damage us in the Sight of God's Majesty,
   provided we took no pleasure in it, and did not consent to it; and that
   because in temptation we do not act, we only suffer, and inasmuch as we
   take no delight in it, we can be liable to no blame. S. Paul bore long
   time with temptations of the flesh, but so far from displeasing God
   thereby, He was glorified in them. The blessed Angela di Foligni
   underwent terrible carnal temptations, which move us to pity as we read
   of them. S. Francis and S. Benedict both experienced grievous
   temptations, so that the one cast himself amid thorns, the other into
   the snow, to quench them, but so far from losing anything of God's
   Grace thereby, they greatly increased it.

   Be then very courageous amid temptation, and never imagine yourself
   conquered so long as it is displeasing to you, ever bearing in mind the
   difference between experiencing and consenting to temptation, [181]
   --that difference being, that whereas they may be experienced while
   most displeasing to us, we can never consent to them without taking
   pleasure in them, inasmuch as pleasure felt in a temptation is usually
   the first step towards consent. So let the enemies of our salvation
   spread as many snares and wiles in our way as they will, let them
   besiege the door of our heart perpetually, let them ply us with endless
   proposals to sin,--so long as we abide in our firm resolution to take
   no pleasure therein, we cannot offend God any more than the husband of
   the princess in my illustration could be displeased with her because of
   the overtures made to her, so long as she was in no way gratified by
   them. Of course, there is one great difference between my imaginary
   princess and the soul, namely, that the former has it in her power to
   drive away the messenger of evil and never hear him more, while the
   latter cannot always refuse to experience temptation, although it be
   always in its power to refuse consent. But how long soever the
   temptation may persist, it cannot harm us so long as it is unwelcome to
   us.

   But again, as to the pleasure which may be taken in temptation
   (technically called delectation), inasmuch as our souls have two parts,
   one inferior, the other superior, and the inferior does not always
   choose to be led by the superior, but takes its own line,--it not
   unfrequently happens that the inferior part takes pleasure in a
   temptation not only without consent from, but absolutely in
   contradiction to the superior will. It is this contest which S. Paul
   describes when he speaks of the "law in my members, warring against the
   law of my mind," [182] and of the "flesh lusting against the spirit."
   [183]

   Have you ever watched a great burning furnace heaped up with ashes?
   Look at it some ten or twelve hours afterwards, and there will scarce
   be any living fire there, or only a little smouldering in the very
   heart thereof. Nevertheless, if you can find that tiny lingering spark,
   it will suffice to rekindle the extinguished flames. So it is with
   love, which is the true spiritual life amid our greatest, most active
   temptations. Temptation, flinging its delectation into the inferior
   part of the soul, covers it wholly with ashes, and leaves but a little
   spark of God's Love, which can be found nowhere save hidden far down in
   the heart or mind, and even that is hard to find. But nevertheless it
   is there, since however troubled we may have been in body and mind, we
   firmly resolved not to consent to sin or the temptation thereto, and
   that delectation of the exterior man was rejected by the interior
   spirit. Thus though our will may have been thoroughly beset by the
   temptation, it was not conquered, and so we are certain that all such
   delectation was involuntary, and consequently not sinful.

CHAPTER IV. Two striking Illustrations of the same.

   THIS distinction, which is very important, is well illustrated by the
   description S. Jerome gives of a young man bound to a voluptuous bed by
   the softest silken cords, and subjected to the wiles and lures of a
   treacherous tempter, with the express object of causing him to fall.
   Greatly as all his senses and imagination must inevitably have been
   possessed by so vehement an assault, he proved that his heart was free
   and his will unconquered, for, having physical control over no member
   save his tongue, he bit that off and spat it out at his foe, a foe more
   terrible than the tyrant's executioners.

   S. Catherine of Sienna has left a somewhat similar record. The Evil One
   having obtained permission from God to assault that pious virgin with
   all his strength, so long as he laid no hand upon her, filled her heart
   with impure suggestions, and surrounded her with every conceivable
   temptation of sight and sound, which, penetrating into the Saint's
   heart, so filled it, that, as she herself has said, nothing remained
   free save her most acute superior will. This struggle endured long,
   until at length Our Lord appeared to her, and she exclaimed, "Where
   wert Thou, O most Dear Lord, when my heart was so overwhelmed with
   darkness and foulness?" Whereupon He answered, "I was within thy heart,
   My child." "How could that be, Lord," she asked, "when it was so full
   of evil? Canst Thou abide in a place so foul?" Then our Lord replied,
   "Tell Me, did these evil thoughts and imaginations give thee pain or
   pleasure? didst thou take delight, or didst thou grieve over them?" To
   which S. Catherine made answer, "They grieved me exceedingly." Then the
   Lord said, "Who, thinkest thou, was it that caused thee to be thus
   grieved, save I Myself, hidden within thy soul? Believe Me, My child,
   had I not been there, these evil thoughts which swarmed around thy
   soul, and which thou couldst not banish, would speedily have
   overpowered it, and entering in, thy free will would have accepted
   them, and so death had struck that soul; but inasmuch as I was there, I
   filled thy heart with reluctance and resistance, so that it set itself
   stedfastly against the temptation, and finding itself unable to contend
   as vigorously as it desired, it did but experience a yet more vehement
   abhorrence of sin and of itself. Thus these very troubles became a
   great merit again to thee, and a great accession of virtue and strength
   to thy soul."

   Here, you see, were the embers covered over with ashes, while
   temptation and delectation had entered the heart and surrounded the
   will, which, aided only by the Saviour, resisted all evil inspirations
   with great disgust, and a persevering refusal to consent to sin. Verily
   the soul which loves God is sometimes in sore straits to know whether
   He abideth in it or no, and whether that Divine Love for which it
   fights is extinguished or burns yet. But it is the very essence of the
   perfection of that Heavenly Love to require its lovers to endure and
   fight for Love's sake, without knowing even whether they possess the
   very Love for which and in which they strive.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER V. Encouragement for the Tempted Soul.

   GOD never permits such grievous temptations and assaults to try any,
   save those souls whom He designs to lead on to His own living, highest
   love, but nevertheless it does not follow as a natural consequence that
   they are certain to attain thereto. Indeed, it has often happened that
   those who had been stedfast under violent assaults, failing to
   correspond faithfully to Divine Grace, have yielded under the pressure
   of very trifling temptations. I would warn you of this, my child, so
   that, should you ever be tried by great temptations, you may know that
   God is showing special favour to you, thereby proving that He means to
   exalt you in His Sight; but that at the same time you may ever be
   humble and full of holy fear, not overconfident in your power to resist
   lesser temptations because you have overcome those that were greater,
   unless by means of a most stedfast faithfulness to God.

   Come what may in the shape of temptation, attended by whatsoever of
   delectation,--so long as your will refuses consent, not merely to the
   temptation itself, but also to the delectation, you need have no
   fear,--God is not offended. When any one has swooned away, and gives no
   sign of life, we put our hand to his heart, and if we find the
   slightest fluttering there, we conclude that he still lives, and that,
   with the help of stimulants and counter-irritants, we may restore
   consciousness and power. Even so, sometimes amid the violence of
   temptation the soul seems altogether to faint away, and to lose all
   spiritual life and action. But if you would be sure how it really is,
   put your hand on the heart. See whether heart and will yet have any
   spiritual motion; that is to say, whether they fulfil their own special
   duty in refusing consent to and acceptance of temptation and its
   gratification; for so long as the power to refuse exists within the
   soul, we may be sure that Love, the life of the soul, is there, and
   that Jesus Christ, our Lord and Saviour, is within, although, it may
   be, hidden; and that by means of stedfast perseverance in prayer, and
   the Sacraments, and confidence in God, strength will be restored, and
   the soul will live with a full and joyous life.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VI. When Temptation and Delectation are Sin.

   THAT princess, whom we have already taken as an illustration, was not
   to blame in the unlawful pursuit we supposed to be made of her, because
   it was against her will; but if, on the contrary, she had in any way
   led to it, or sought to attract him who sought her, she were certainly
   guilty of the pursuit itself; and even if she withheld her consent, she
   would still deserve censure and punishment. Thus it sometimes happens
   that temptation in itself is sin to us, because we have ourselves
   brought it upon us. For instance, if I know that gaming leads me to
   passion and blasphemy, and that all play is a temptation to me, I sin
   each and every time that I play, and I am responsible for all the
   temptations which may come upon me at the gaming table. So again, if I
   know that certain society involves me in temptation to evil, and yet I
   voluntarily seek it, I am unquestionably responsible for all that I may
   encounter in the way of temptation therein.

   When it is possible to avoid the delectation arising out of temptation,
   it is always a sin to accept it, in proportion to the pleasure we take,
   and the amount of consent given, whether that be great or small, brief
   or lasting. The princess of our illustration is to blame if she merely
   listens to the guilty propositions made to her but still more so if,
   after listening, she takes pleasure in them, and allows her heart to
   feed and rest thereupon; for although she has no intention of really
   doing that which is proposed, her heart gives a spiritual consent when
   she takes pleasure in it, and it must always be wrong to let either
   body or mind rest on anything unworthy,--and wrongdoing lies so
   entirely in the heart's co-operation, that without this no mere bodily
   action can be sin.

   Therefore, when you are tempted to any sin, examine whether you
   voluntarily exposed yourself to the temptation, and if you find that
   you have done so by putting yourself into its way, or by not foreseeing
   the temptation, as you ought to have done, then it is sin; but if you
   have done nothing to bring about the temptation, it is not in anywise
   to be imputed to you as sin.

   When the delectation which attends temptation might have been avoided,
   but has not been avoided, there is always a certain amount of sin
   according to the degree to which we have lingered over it, and the kind
   of pleasure we have taken in it. If a woman who has not wilfully
   attracted unlawful admiration, nevertheless takes pleasure in such
   admiration, she is doing wrong, always supposing that what pleases her
   is the admiration. But if the person who courts her plays exquisitely
   on the lute, and she took pleasure, not in the personal attentions paid
   to herself, but in the sweetness and harmony of the music, there would
   be no sin in that, although it would be wrong to give way to any extent
   to her pleasure, for fear of its leading on to pleasure in the pursuit
   of herself. So again, if some clever stratagem whereby to avenge me of
   an enemy is suggested, and I take no satisfaction and give no consent
   to the vengeance, but am only pleased at the cleverness of the
   invention, I am not sinning; although it were very inexpedient to dwell
   long upon it, lest little by little I should go on to take pleasure in
   the thought of revenge.

   Sometimes we are taken by surprise by some sense of delectation
   following so closely upon the temptation, that we are off our guard.
   This can be but a very slight venial sin, which would become greater
   if, after once we perceive the danger, we allow ourselves to dally with
   it, or question as to admitting or rejecting it,--greater still if we
   carelessly neglect to resist it;--and if we deliberately allow
   ourselves to rest in any such pleasure, it becomes very great sin,
   especially if the thing attracting us be unquestionably evil. Thus it
   is a great sin in a woman to allow herself to dwell upon any unlawful
   affections, although she may have no intention of ever really yielding
   to them.

CHAPTER VII. Remedies for Great Occasions.

   SO soon as you feel yourself anywise tempted, do as our little children
   when they see a wolf or a bear in the mountains. Forthwith they run to
   the protection of their father or mother, or at least cry out for help.
   Do you fly in like manner to God, claiming His compassion and
   succour,--it is the remedy taught us by our Lord Himself: "Pray that ye
   enter not into temptation" [184]

   If, nevertheless, the temptation persists or increases, hasten in
   spirit to embrace the holy Cross, as though you beheld Jesus Christ
   Crucified actually Present. Make firm protests against consenting, and
   ask His Help thereto; and, so long as the temptation lasts, do you
   persist in making acts of non-consent. But while making these acts and
   these protests, do not fix your eyes on the temptation,--look solely on
   Our Lord, for if you dwell on the temptation, especially when it is
   strong, your courage may be shaken. Divert your mind with any right and
   healthy occupation, for if that takes possession and fills your
   thoughts, it will drive away temptation and evil imaginations.

   One great remedy against all manner of temptation, great or small, is
   to open the heart and lay bare its suggestions, likings, and
   dislikings, to your director; for, as you may observe, the first
   condition which the Evil One makes with a soul, when he wants to seduce
   it, is silence. Even as a bad man, seeking to seduce a woman, enjoins
   silence concerning himself to her father or husband, whereas God would
   always have us make known all His inspirations to our superiors and
   guides.

   If, after all, the temptation still troubles and persecutes us, there
   is nothing to be done on our side save to persist in protesting that we
   will not consent; for just as no maiden can be married while she
   persists in saying No, so no soul, however oppressed, can be guilty
   while it says the same.

   Do not argue with your Enemy, and give but one answer,--that with which
   Our Lord confounded him, "Get thee hence, Satan, for it is written,
   Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve."
   [185] Just as the pure wife would make no reply, and cast no glance on
   the foul seducer who strove to lead her astray, but would straightway
   fly from him to her husband's side, not arguing, but cleaving to her
   lawful lord in renewed fidelity;--so the devout soul when assailed by
   temptation should never trifle with it by answer or argument, but
   simply fly to the Side of Jesus Christ, its Bridegroom; renewing its
   pledges of unchanging devotion and faithfulness to Him.

CHAPTER VIII. How to resist Minor Temptations.

   WHILE it is right to resist great temptations with invincible courage,
   and all such victories will be most valuable, still there is perhaps
   more absolute profit to our souls in resisting little ones. For
   although the greater temptations exceed in power, there are so
   infinitely more in number of little temptations, that a victory over
   them is fully as important as over the greater but rarer ones. No one
   will question but that wolves and bears are more dangerous than flies,
   but they do not worry and annoy us, or try our patience as these do.
   While is not a hard thing to abstain from murder, but it is very
   difficult to avoid all passing fits of anger, which assail us at every
   moment. A man or woman can easily keep from adultery, but it is less
   easy to abstain from all words and glances which are disloyal. While is
   easy to keep from stealing another man's goods, but often difficult to
   resist coveting them; easy to avoid bearing false witness in direct
   judgment, difficult to be perfectly truthful in conversation; easy to
   refrain from getting drunk, difficult to be absolutely sober; easy not
   to wish for a neighbour's death, difficult not to wish anything
   contrary to his interests; easy to keep from slander, difficult to
   avoid all contempt.

   In short, all these minor temptations to anger, suspicion, jealousy,
   envy, levity, vanity, duplicity, affectation, foolish thoughts, and the
   like, are a perpetual trial even to those who are most devout and most
   resolute; and therefore, my daughter, we ought carefully and diligently
   to prepare for this warfare. Be assured that every victory won over
   these little foes is as a precious stone in the crown of glory which
   God prepares for us in Paradise. So, while awaiting and making ready
   for a stedfast and brave resistance to great temptations should they
   come, let us not fail diligently to fight against these meaner, weaker
   foes.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER IX. How remedy Minor Temptations.

   NOW as to all these trifling temptations of vanity, suspicion,
   vexation, jealousy, envy, and the like, which flit around one like
   flies or gnats, now settling on one's nose,--anon stinging one's
   cheek,--as it is wholly impossible altogether to free one's-self from
   their importunity; the best resistance one can make is not to be
   fretted by them. All these things may worry one, but they cannot really
   harm us, so long as our wills are firmly resolved to serve God.

   Therefore despise all these trivial onslaughts, and do not even deign
   to think about them; but let them buzz about your ears as much as they
   please, and flit hither and thither just as you tolerate flies;--even
   if they sting you, and strive to light within your heart, do no more
   than simply remove them, not fighting with them, or arguing, but simply
   doing that which is precisely contrary to their suggestions, and
   specially making acts of the Love of God. If you will take my advice,
   you will not toil on obstinately in resisting them by exercising the
   contrary virtue, for that would become a sort of struggle with the
   foe;--but, after making an act of this directly contrary virtue (always
   supposing you have time to recognise what the definite temptation is),
   simply turn with your whole heart towards Jesus Christ Crucified, and
   lovingly kiss His Sacred Feet. This is the best way to conquer the
   Enemy, whether in small or great temptations; for inasmuch as the Love
   of God contains the perfection of every virtue, and that more
   excellently than the very virtues themselves; it is also the most
   sovereign remedy against all vice, and if you accustom your mind under
   all manner of temptation to have recourse to this safety-place, you
   will not be constrained to enter upon a worryingly minute investigation
   of your temptations, but, so soon as you are anywise troubled, your
   mind will turn naturally to its one sovereign remedy. Moreover, this
   way of dealing with temptation is so offensive to the Evil One, that,
   finding he does but provoke souls to an increased love of God by his
   assaults, he discontinues them.

   In short, you may be sure that if you dally with your minor,
   oft-recurring temptations, and examine too closely into them in detail,
   you will simply stupefy yourself to no purpose.

CHAPTER X. How to strengthen the Heart against Temptation.

   EXAMINE from time to time what are the dominant passions of your soul,
   and having ascertained this, mould your life, so that in thought, word
   and deed you may as far as possible counteract them. For instance, if
   you know that you are disposed to be vain, reflect often upon the
   emptiness of this earthly life, call to mind how burdensome all mere
   earthly vanities will be to the conscience at the hour of death, how
   unworthy of a generous heart, how puerile and childish, and the like.
   See that your words have no tendency to foster your vanity, and even
   though you may seem to be doing so but reluctantly, strive to despise
   it heartily, and to rank yourself in every way among its enemies.
   Indeed, by dint of steady opposition to anything, we teach ourselves to
   hate even that which we began by liking. Do as many lowly, humble deeds
   as lie in your power, even if you perform them unwillingly at first;
   for by this means you will form a habit of humility, and you will
   weaken your vanity, so that when temptation arises, you will be less
   predisposed to yield, and stronger to resist. Or if you are given to
   avarice, think often of the folly of this sin, which makes us the slave
   of what was made only to serve us; remember how when we die we must
   leave all we possess to those who come after us, who may squander it,
   ruin their own souls by misusing it, and so forth. Speak against
   covetousness, commend the abhorrence in which it is held by the world;
   and constrain yourself to abundant almsgiving, as also to not always
   using opportunities of accumulation. If you have a tendency to trifle
   with the affections, often call to mind what a dangerous amusement it
   is for yourself and others; how unworthy a thing it is to use the
   noblest feelings of the heart as a mere pastime; and how readily such
   trifling becomes mere levity. Let your conversation turn on purity and
   simplicity of heart, and strive to frame your actions accordingly,
   avoiding all that savours of affectation or flirting.

   In a word, let your time of peace,--that is to say, the time when you
   are not beset by temptations to sin,--be used in cultivating the graces
   most opposed to your natural difficulties, and if opportunities for
   their exercise do not arise, go out of your way to seek them, and by so
   doing you will strengthen your heart against future temptations.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XI. Anxiety of Mind.

   ANXIETY of mind is not so much an abstract temptation, as the source
   whence various temptations arise. Sadness, when defined, is the mental
   grief we feel because of our involuntary ailments;--whether the evil be
   exterior, such as poverty, sickness or contempt; or interior, such as
   ignorance, dryness, depression or temptation. Directly that the soul is
   conscious of some such trouble, it is downcast, and so trouble sets in.
   Then we at once begin to try to get rid of it, and find means to shake
   it off; and so far rightly enough, for it is natural to us all to
   desire good, and shun that which we hold to be evil.

   If any one strives to be delivered from his troubles out of love of
   God, he will strive patiently, gently, humbly and calmly, looking for
   deliverance rather to God's Goodness and Providence than to his own
   industry or efforts; but if self-love is the prevailing object he will
   grow hot and eager in seeking relief, as though all depended more upon
   himself than upon God. I do not say that the person thinks so, but he
   acts eagerly as though he did think it. Then if he does not find what
   he wants at once, he becomes exceedingly impatient and troubled, which
   does not mend matters, but on the contrary makes them worse, and so he
   gets into an unreasonable state of anxiety and distress, till he begins
   to fancy that there is no cure for his trouble. Thus you see how a
   disturbance, which was right at the outset, begets anxiety, and anxiety
   goes on into an excessive distress, which is exceedingly dangerous.

   This unresting anxiety is the greatest evil which can happen to the
   soul, sin only excepted. Just as internal commotions and seditions ruin
   a commonwealth, and make it incapable of resisting its foreign enemies,
   so if our heart be disturbed and anxious, it loses power to retain such
   graces as it has, as well as strength to resist the temptations of the
   Evil One, who is all the more ready to fish (according to an old
   proverb) in troubled waters.

   Anxiety arises from an unregulated desire to be delivered from any
   pressing evil, or to obtain some hoped-for good. Nevertheless nothing
   tends so greatly to enchance the one or retard the other as
   over-eagerness and anxiety. Birds that are captured in nets and snares
   become inextricably entangled therein, because they flutter and
   struggle so much. Therefore, whensoever you urgently desire to be
   delivered from any evil, or to attain some good thing, strive above all
   else to keep a calm, restful spirit,--steady your judgment and will,
   and then go quietly and easily after your object, taking all fitting
   means to attain thereto. By easily I do not mean carelessly, but
   without eagerness, disquietude or anxiety; otherwise, so far from
   bringing about what you wish, you will hinder it, and add more and more
   to your perplexities. "My soul is alway in my hand, yet do I not forget
   Thy Law," [186] David says. Examine yourself often, at least night and
   morning, as to whether your soul is "in your hand;" or whether it has
   been wrested thence by any passionate or anxious emotion. See whether
   your soul is fully under control, or whether it has not in anywise
   escaped from beneath your hand, to plunge into some unruly love, hate,
   envy, lust, fear, vexation or joy. And if it has so strayed, before all
   else seek it out, and quietly bring it back to the Presence of God,
   once more placing all your hopes and affections under the direction of
   His Holy Will. Just as one who fears to lose some precious possession
   holds it tight in his hand, so, like King David, we ought to be able to
   say, "My soul is alway in my hand, and therefore I have not forgotten
   Thy Law."

   Do not allow any wishes to disturb your mind under the pretext of their
   being trifling and unimportant; for if they gain the day, greater and
   weightier matters will find your heart more accessible to disturbance.
   When you are conscious that you are growing anxious, commend yourself
   to God, and resolve stedfastly not to take any steps whatever to obtain
   the result you desire, until your disturbed state of mind is altogether
   quieted;--unless indeed it should be necessary to do something without
   delay, in which case you must restrain the rush of inclination,
   moderating it, as far as possible, so as to act rather from reason than
   impulse.

   If you can lay your anxiety before your spiritual guide, or at least
   before some trusty and devout friend, you may be sure that you will
   find great solace. The heart finds relief in telling its troubles to
   another, just as the body when suffering from persistent fever finds
   relief from bleeding. It is the best of remedies, and therefore it was
   that S. Louis counselled his son, "If thou hast any uneasiness lying
   heavy on thy heart, tell it forthwith to thy confessor, or to some
   other pious person, and the comfort he will give will enable thee to
   bear it easily."

CHAPTER XII. Of Sadness and Sorrow.

   S. PAUL says that "godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to
   be repented of, but the sorrow of the world worketh death." [187] So we
   see that sorrow may be good or bad according to the several results it
   produces in us. And indeed there are more bad than good results arising
   from it, for the only good ones are mercy and repentance; whereas there
   are six evil results, namely, anguish, sloth, indignation, jealousy,
   envy and impatience. The Wise Man says that "sorrow hath killed many,
   and there is no profit therein," [188] and that because for the two
   good streams which flow from the spring of sadness, there are these six
   which are downright evil.

   The Enemy makes use of sadness to try good men with his
   temptations:--just as he tries to make bad men merry in their sin, so
   he seeks to make the good sorrowful amid their works of piety; and
   while making sin attractive so as to draw men to it, he strives to turn
   them from holiness by making it disagreeable. The Evil One delights in
   sadness and melancholy, because they are his own characteristics. He
   will be in sadness and sorrow through all Eternity, and he would fain
   have all others the same.

   The "sorrow of the world" disturbs the heart, plunges it into anxiety,
   stirs up unreasonable fears, disgusts it with prayer, overwhelms and
   stupefies the brain, deprives the soul of wisdom, judgment, resolution
   and courage, weakening all its powers; in a word, it is like a hard
   winter, blasting all the earth's beauty, and numbing all animal life;
   for it deprives the soul of sweetness and power in every faculty.

   Should you, my daughter, ever be attacked by this evil spirit of
   sadness, make use of the following remedies. "Is any among you
   afflicted?" says S. James, "let him pray." [189] Prayer is a sovereign
   remedy, it lifts the mind to God, Who is our only Joy and Consolation.
   But when you pray let your words and affections, whether interior or
   exterior, all tend to love and trust in God. "O God of Mercy, most
   Loving Lord, Sweet Saviour, Lord of my heart, my Joy, my Hope, my
   Beloved, my Bridegroom."

   Vigorously resist all tendencies to melancholy, and although all you do
   may seem to be done coldly, wearily and indifferently, do not give in.
   The Enemy strives to make us languid in doing good by depression, but
   when he sees that we do not cease our efforts to work, and that those
   efforts become all the more earnest by reason of their being made in
   resistance to him, he leaves off troubling us.

   Make use of hymns and spiritual songs; they have often frustrated the
   Evil One in his operations, as was the case when the evil spirit which
   possessed Saul was driven forth by music and psalmody. It is well also
   to occupy yourself in external works, and that with as much variety as
   may lead us to divert the mind from the subject which oppresses it, and
   to cheer and kindle it, for depression generally makes us dry and cold.
   Use external acts of fervour, even though they are tasteless at the
   time; embrace your crucifix, clasp it to your breast, kiss the Feet and
   Hands of your Dear Lord, raise hands and eyes to Heaven, and cry out to
   God in loving, trustful ejaculations: "My Beloved is mine, and I am
   His. 1 [190] A bundle of myrrh is my Well-beloved, He shall lie within
   my breast. Mine eyes long sore for Thy Word, O when wilt Thou comfort
   me! [191] O Jesus, be Thou my Saviour, and my soul shall live. Who
   shall separate me from the Love of Christ?" [192] etc.

   Moderate bodily discipline is useful in resisting depression, because
   it rouses the mind from dwelling on itself; and frequent Communion is
   specially valuable; the Bread of Life strengthens the heart and
   gladdens the spirits.

   Lay bare all the feelings, thoughts and longings which are the result
   of your depression to your confessor or director, in all humility and
   faithfulness; seek the society of spiritually-minded people, and
   frequent such as far as possible while you are suffering. And, finally,
   resign yourself into God's Hands, endeavouring to bear this harassing
   depression patiently, as a just punishment for past idle mirth. Above
   all, never doubt but that, after He has tried you sufficiently, God
   will deliver you from the trial.

CHAPTER XIII. Of Spiritual and Sensible Consolations, and how to receive them.

   THE order of God's Providence maintains a perpetual vicissitude in the
   material being of this world; day is continually turning to night,
   spring to summer, summer to autumn, autumn to winter, winter to spring;
   no two days are ever exactly alike. Some are foggy, rainy, some dry or
   windy; and this endless variety greatly enhances the beauty of the
   universe. And even so precisely is it with man (who, as ancient writers
   have said, is a miniature of the world), for he is never long in any
   one condition, and his life on earth flows by like the mighty waters,
   heaving and tossing with an endless variety of motion; one while
   raising him on high with hope, another plunging him low in fear; now
   turning him to the right with rejoicing, then driving him to the left
   with sorrows; and no single day, no, not even one hour, is entirely the
   same as any other of his life.

   All this is a very weighty warning, and teaches us to aim at an abiding
   and unchangeable evenness of mind amid so great an uncertainty of
   events; and, while all around is changing, we must seek to remain
   immoveable, ever looking to, reaching after and desiring our God. Let
   the ship take what tack you will, let her course be eastward or
   westward, northern or southern, let any wind whatsoever fill her sails,
   but meanwhile her compass will never cease to point to its one
   unchanging lodestar. Let all around us be overthrown, nay more, all
   within us; I mean let our soul be sad or glad, in bitterness or joy, at
   peace or troubled, dry and parched, or soft and fruitful, let the sun
   scorch, or the dew refresh it; but all the while the magnet of our
   heart and mind, our superior will, which is our moral compass, must
   continually point to the Love of God our Creator, our Saviour, our only
   Sovereign Good. "Whether we live, we live unto the Lord, or whether we
   die, we die unto the Lord; whether we live therefore or die, we are the
   Lord's. Who shall separate us from the Love of Christ?" [193] Nay,
   verily, nothing can ever separate us from that Love;--neither
   tribulation nor distress, neither death nor life, neither present
   suffering nor fear of ills to come; neither the deceits of evil spirits
   nor the heights of satisfaction, nor the depths of sorrow; neither
   tenderness nor desolation, shall be able to separate us from that Holy
   Love, whose foundation is in Christ Jesus. Such a fixed resolution
   never to forsake God, or let go of His Precious Love, serves as ballast
   to our souls, and will keep them stedfast amid the endless changes and
   chances of this our natural life. For just as bees, when overtaken by a
   gust of wind, carry little pebbles to weight themselves, [194] in order
   that they may resist the storm, and not be driven at its will,--so the
   soul, which has firmly grasped the Unchanging Love of God, will abide
   unshaken amid the changes and vicissitudes of consolations and
   afflictions,--whether spiritual or temporal, external or internal.

   But let us come to some special detail, beyond this general doctrine.

   1. I would say, then, that devotion does not consist in conscious
   sweetness and tender consolations, which move one to sighs and tears,
   and bring about a kind of agreeable, acceptable sense of
   self-satisfaction. No, my child, this is not one and the same as
   devotion, for you will find many persons who do experience these
   consolations, yet who, nevertheless, are evilminded, and consequently
   are devoid of all true Love of God, still more of all true devotion.
   When Saul was in pursuit of David, who fled from him into the
   wilderness of En-gedi, he entered into a cave alone, wherein David and
   his followers were hidden; and David could easily have killed him, but
   he not only spared Saul's life, he would not even frighten him; but,
   letting him depart quietly, hastened after the King, to affirm his
   innocence, and tell him how he had been at the mercy of his injured
   servant. Thereupon Saul testified to the softening of his heart by
   tender words, calling David his son, and exalting his generosity;
   lifting up his voice, he wept, and, foretelling David's future
   greatness, besought him to deal kindly with Saul's "seed after him."
   [195] What more could Saul have done? Yet for all this he had not
   changed his real mind, and continued to persecute David as bitterly as
   before. Just so there are many people who, while contemplating the
   Goodness of God, or the Passion of His Dear Son, feel an emotion which
   leads to sighs, tears, and very lively prayers and thanksgivings, so
   that it might fairly be supposed that their hearts were kindled by a
   true devotion;--but when put to the test, all this proves but as the
   passing showers of a hot summer, which splash down in large drops, but
   do not penetrate the soil, or make it to bring forth anything better
   than mushrooms. In like manner these tears and emotions do not really
   touch an evil heart, but are altogether fruitless;--inasmuch as in
   spite of them all those poor people would not renounce one farthing of
   illgotten gain, or one unholy affection; they would not suffer the
   slightest worldly inconvenience for the Sake of the Saviour over Whom
   they wept. So that their pious emotions may fairly be likened to
   spiritual fungi,--as not merely falling short of real devotion, but
   often being so many snares of the Enemy, who beguiles souls with these
   trivial consolations, so as to make them stop short, and rest satisfied
   therewith, instead of seeking after true solid devotion, which consists
   in a firm, resolute, ready, active will, prepared to do whatsoever is
   acceptable to God. A little child, who sees the surgeon bleed his
   mother, will cry when he sees the lancet touch her; but let that mother
   for whom he weeps ask for his apple or a sugar-plum which he has in his
   hand, and he will on no account part with it; and too much of our
   seeming devotion is of this kind. We weep feelingly at the spear
   piercing the Crucified Saviour's Side, and we do well,--but why cannot
   we give Him the apple we hold, for which He asks, heartily? I mean our
   heart, the only love-apple which that Dear Saviour craves of us. Why
   cannot we resign the numberless trifling attachments, indulgences, and
   self-complacencies of which He fain would deprive us, only we will not
   let Him do so; because they are the sugar-plums, sweeter to our taste
   than His Heavenly Grace? Surely this is but as the fondness of
   children;--demonstrative, but weak, capricious, unpractical. Devotion
   does not consist in such exterior displays of a tenderness which may be
   purely the result of a naturally impressionable, plastic character; or
   which may be the seductive action of the Enemy, or an excitable
   imagination stirred up by him.

   2. Nevertheless these tender warm emotions are sometimes good and
   useful, for they kindle the spiritual appetite, cheer the mind, and
   infuse a holy gladness into the devout life, which embellishes all we
   do even externally. It was such a taste for holy things that made David
   cry out, "O how sweet are Thy words unto my throat, yea, sweeter than
   honey unto my mouth." [196] And assuredly the tiniest little comfort
   received through devotion is worth far more than the most abundant
   delights of this world. The milk of the Heavenly Bridegroom, in other
   words His spiritual favours, are sweeter to the soul than the costliest
   wine of the pleasures of this world, and to those who have tasted
   thereof all else seems but as gall and wormwood. There is a certain
   herb which, if chewed, imparts so great a sweetness that they who keep
   it in their mouth cannot hunger or thirst; even so those to whom God
   gives His Heavenly manna of interior sweetness and consolation, cannot
   either desire or even accept worldly consolations with any real zest or
   satisfaction. It is as a little foretaste of eternal blessedness which
   God gives to those who seek it; it is as the sugar-plum with which He
   attracts His little ones; as a cordial offered to strengthen their
   heart; as the first-fruits of their future reward. The legend tells us
   that Alexander the Great discovered Arabia Felix by means of the
   perfumes carried by the winds across the ocean upon which he sailed,
   reviving his courage and that of his comrades. And so the blessings and
   sweetnesses, which are wafted to us as we sail across the stormy sea of
   this mortal life, are a foretaste of the bliss of that Ever-blessed
   Heavenly Home to which we look and long.

   3. But, perhaps you will say, if there are sensible consolations which
   are undoubtedly good and come from God, and at the same time others
   which are unprofitable, perilous, even harmful, because they proceed
   from mere natural causes, or even from the Enemy himself, how am I to
   know one from the other, or distinguish what is most profitable even
   among those which are good? It is a general rule, with respect to the
   feelings and affections, that their test is in their fruits. Our hearts
   are as trees, of which the affections and passions are their branches,
   and deeds and acts their fruits. That is, a good heart, of which the
   affections are good, and those are good affections which result in good
   and holy actions. If our spiritual tenderness and sweetness and
   consolation make us more humble,--patient, forbearing, charitable and
   kindly towards our neighbours,--more earnest in mortifying our own evil
   inclinations and lusts, more diligent in our duties, more docile and
   submissive to those who have a claim to our obedience, more simple in
   our whole manner of life,--then doubtless, my daughter, they come from
   God. But if this sweetness and tenderness is sweet only to ourselves,
   if we are fanciful, bitter, punctilious, impatient, obstinate, proud,
   presumptuous, harsh towards our neighbour, while reckoning ourselves as
   half-made saints, indocile to correction or guidance, then we may be
   assured our consolations are spurious and hurtful. A good tree will
   bring forth none save good fruit.

   4. If we are favoured with any such sweetness, we must humble ourselves
   deeply before God, and beware of being led to cry out "How good I am!"
   No indeed, such gifts do not make us any better, for, as I have already
   said, devotion does not consist in such things; rather let us say, "How
   good God is to those who hope in Him, and to the souls that seek Him!"
   If a man has sugar in his mouth, he cannot call his mouth sweet, but
   the sugar; and so although our spiritual sweetness is admirable, and
   God Who imparts it is all good, it by no means follows that he who
   receives it is good. Let us count ourselves but as little children,
   having need of milk, and believe that these sugar-plums are only given
   us because we are still feeble and delicate, needing bribes and wiles
   to lead us on to the Love of God. But, as a general rule, we shall do
   well to receive all such graces and favours humbly, making much of
   them, not for their own importance, but rather because it is God's Hand
   which fills our hearts with them, as a mother coaxes her child with one
   sugar-plum after another. If the child were wise, he would prize the
   loving caresses of his mother, more than the material sugar-plum,
   however sweet. So while it is a great thing to have spiritual
   sweetnesses, the sweetest of all is to know that it is the loving
   parental Hand of God which feeds us, heart, mind and soul, with them.
   And, having received them humbly, let us be diligent in using them
   according to the intention of the Giver. Why do you suppose God gives
   us such sweetness? To make us kinder one to another, and more loving
   towards Him. A mother gives her child a sweetmeat to win a kiss; be it
   ours reverently to kiss the Saviour Who gives us these good things. And
   by kissing Him, I mean obeying Him, keeping His Commandments, doing His
   Will, heeding His wishes, in a word, embracing Him tenderly,
   obediently, and faithfully. So the day on which we have enjoyed some
   special spiritual consolation should be marked by extra diligence and
   humility. And from time to time it is well to renounce all such,
   realising to ourselves that although we accept and cherish them humbly,
   because they come from God, and kindle His Love in our hearts, still
   they are not our main object, but God and His Holy Love;--that we seek
   less the consolation than the Consoler, less His tangible sweetness
   than our sweet Saviour, less external pleasure than Him Who is the
   Delight of Heaven and earth; and with such a mind we should resolve to
   abide stedfast in God's Holy Love, even if our whole life were to be
   utterly devoid of all sweetness; as ready to abide on Mount Calvary as
   on Mount Tabor; to cry out, "It is good for us to be here," whether
   with our Lord on the Cross or in glory.

   Lastly, I advise you to take counsel with your director concerning any
   unusual flow of consolations or emotions, so that he may guide you in
   their wise usage; for it is written, "Hast thou found honey? eat so
   much as is sufficient for thee." [197]

CHAPTER XIV. Of Dryness and Spiritual Barrenness.

   SO much for what is to be done in times of spiritual consolations. But
   these bright days will not last for ever, and sometimes you will be so
   devoid of all devout feelings, that it will seem to you that your soul
   is a desert land, fruitless, sterile, wherein you can find no path
   leading to God, no drop of the waters of Grace to soften the dryness
   which threatens to choke it entirely. Verily, at such a time the soul
   is greatly to be pitied, above all, when this trouble presses heavily,
   for then, like David, its meat are tears day and night, while the Enemy
   strives to drive it to despair, crying out, "Where is now thy God? how
   thinkest thou to find Him, or how wilt thou ever find again the joy of
   His Holy Grace?"

   What will you do then, my child? Look well whence the trial comes, for
   we are often ourselves the cause of our own dryness and barrenness. A
   mother refuses sugar to her sickly child, and so God deprives us of
   consolations when they do but feed self-complacency or presumption. "It
   is good for me that I have been in trouble, for before I was troubled I
   went wrong." [198] So if we neglect to gather up and use the treasures
   of God's Love in due time, He withdraws them as a punishment of our
   sloth. The Israelite who neglected to gather his store of manna in the
   early morning, found none after sunrise, for it was all melted.
   Sometimes, too, we are like the Bride of the Canticles, slumbering on a
   bed of sensual satisfaction and perishable delight, so that when the
   Bridegroom knocks at the door of our heart, and calls us to our
   spiritual duties, we dally with Him, loath to quit our idle and
   delusive pleasures, and then He "withdraws Himself, and is gone," and
   "when I sought Him, I could not find Him; I called Him, but He gave me
   no answer." [199] Of a truth we deserved as much for having been so
   disloyal as to have rejected Him for the things of this world. If we
   are content with the fleshpots of Egypt we shall never receive heavenly
   manna. Bees abhor all artificial scents, and the sweetness of the Holy
   Spirit is incompatible with the world's artificial pleasures.

   Again, any duplicity or unreality in confession or spiritual
   intercourse with your director tends to dryness and barrenness, for, if
   you lie to God's Holy Spirit, you can scarcely wonder that He refuses
   you His comfort. If you do not choose to be simple and honest as a
   little child, you will not win the child's sweetmeats.

   Or you have satiated yourself with worldly delights; and so no wonder
   that spiritual pleasures are repulsive to you. "To the overfed dove
   even cherries are bitter," says an old proverb; and Our Lady in her
   song of praise says, "He has filled the hungry with good things, and
   the rich He hath sent empty away." They who abound in earthly pleasures
   are incapable of appreciating such as are spiritual.

   If you have carefully stored up the fruits of past consolations, you
   will receive more; "to him that hath yet more shall be given," but from
   him who has not kept that which he had, who has lost it through
   carelessness, that which he hath shall be taken away, in other words,
   he will not receive the grace destined for him. Rain refreshes living
   plants, but it only brings rottenness and decay to those which are
   already dead. There are many such causes whereby we lose the
   consolations of religion, and fall into dryness and deadness of spirit,
   so that it is well to examine our conscience, and see if we can trace
   any of these or similar faults. But always remember that this
   examination must not be made anxiously, or in an over-exacting spirit.
   Thus if, after an honest investigation of our own conduct, we find the
   cause of our wrongdoing, we must thank God, for an evil is half cured
   when we have found out its cause. But if, on the contrary, you do not
   find any particular thing which has led to this dryness, do not trifle
   away your time in a further uneasy search, but, without more ado, and
   in all simplicity, do as follows:--

   1. Humble yourself profoundly before God, acknowledging your
   nothingness and misery. Alas, what am I when left to myself! no better,
   Lord, than a parched ground, whose cracks and crevices on every side
   testify its need of the gracious rain of Heaven, while, nevertheless,
   the world's blasts wither it more and more to dust.

   2. Call upon God, and ask for His Gladness. "O give me the comfort of
   Thy help again! My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from
   me." "Depart, O ye unfruitful wind, which parcheth up my soul, and
   come, O gracious south wind, blow upon my garden." Such loving desires
   will fill you with the perfume of holiness.

   3. Go to your confessor, open your heart thoroughly, let him see every
   corner of your soul, and take all his advice with the utmost simplicity
   and humility, for God loves obedience, and He often makes the counsel
   we take, specially that of the guides of souls, to be more useful than
   would seem likely; just as He caused the waters of Jordan, commended by
   Elijah to Naaman, to cure his leprosy in spite of the improbability to
   human reason.

   4. But, after all, nothing is so useful, so fruitful amid this dryness
   and barrenness, as not to yield to a passionate desire of being
   delivered from it. I do not say that one may not desire to be set free,
   but only that one ought not to desire it over-eagerly, but to leave all
   to the sole Mercy of God's special Providence, in order that, so long
   as He pleases, He may keep us amid these thorns and longings. Let us
   say to God at such seasons, "O my Father, if it be possible, let this
   cup pass from me; "--but let us add heartily, "Nevertheless, not my
   will, but Thine be done," and there let us abide as trustingly as we
   are able. When God sees us to be filled with such pious indifference,
   He will comfort us with His grace and favour, as when He beheld Abraham
   ready to offer up his son Isaac, and comforted him with His blessing.
   In every sort of affliction, then, whether bodily or spiritual, in
   every manner of distraction or loss of sensible devotion, let us say
   with our whole heart, and in the deepest submission, "The Lord gave me
   all my blessings, the Lord taketh them away, blessed be the Name of the
   Lord." If we persevere in this humility, He will restore to us His
   mercies as he did to Job, who ever spake thus amid all his troubles. 5.
   And lastly, my daughter, amid all our dryness let us never grow
   discouraged, but go steadily on, patiently waiting the return of better
   things; let us never be misled to give up any devout practices because
   of it, but rather if possible, let us increase our good works, and if
   we cannot offer liquid preserves to our Bridegroom, let us at least
   offer Him dried fruit--it is all one to Him, so long as the heart we
   offer be fully resolved to love Him. In fine weather bees make more
   honey and breed fewer grubs, because they spend so much time in
   gathering the sweet juices of the flowers that they neglect the
   multiplication of their race. But in a cold, cloudy spring they have a
   fuller hive and less honey. And so sometimes, my daughter, in the
   glowing springtide of spiritual consolations, the soul spends so much
   time in storing them up, that amid such abundance it performs fewer
   good works; while, on the contrary, when amid spiritual dryness and
   bitterness, and devoid of all that is attractive in devotion, it
   multiplies its substantial good works, and abounds in the hidden
   virtues of patience, humility, self-abnegation, resignation and
   unselfishness.

   Some people, especially women, fall into the great mistake of imagining
   that when we offer a dry, distasteful service to God, devoid of all
   sentiment and emotion, it is unacceptable to His Divine Majesty;
   whereas, on the contrary, our actions are like roses, which, though
   they may be more beautiful when fresh, have a sweeter and stronger
   scent when they are dried. Good works, done with pleasurable interest,
   are pleasanter to us who think of nothing save our own satisfaction,
   but when they are done amid dryness and deadness they are more precious
   in God's Sight. Yes indeed, my daughter, for in seasons of dryness our
   will forcibly carries us on in God's Service, and so it is stronger and
   more vigorous than at a softer time. There is not much to boast of in
   serving our Prince in the comfort of a time of peace, but to serve Him
   amid the toils and hardness of war, amid trial and persecution, is a
   real proof of faithfulness and perseverance. The blessed Angela di
   Foligni said, that the most acceptable prayer to God is what is made
   forcibly and in spite of ourselves; that is to say, prayer made not to
   please ourselves or our own taste, but solely to please God;--carried
   on, as it were, in spite of inclination, the will triumphing over all
   our drynesses and repugnances. And so of all good works;--the more
   contradictions, exterior or interior, against which we contend in their
   fulfilment, the more precious they are in God's Sight; the less of
   self-pleasing in striving after any virtue, the more Divine Love shines
   forth in all its purity. A child is easily moved to fondle its mother
   when she gives it sweet things, but if he kisses her in return for
   wormwood or camomile it is a proof of very real affection on his part.

CHAPTER XV. An Illustration.

   LET me illustrate what I have said by an anecdote of Saint Bernard.

   It is common to most beginners in God's Service, being as yet
   inexperienced in the fluctuations of grace and in spiritual
   vicissitudes, that when they lose the glow of sensible devotion, and
   the first fascinating lights which led them in their first steps
   towards God, they lose heart, and fall into depression and
   discouragement. Those who are practised in the matter say that it is
   because our human nature cannot bear a prolonged deprivation of some
   kind of satisfaction, either celestial or earthly; and so as souls,
   which have been raised beyond their natural level by a taste of
   superior joys, readily renounce visible delights when the higher joys
   are taken away, as well as those more earthly pleasures, they, not
   being yet trained to a patient waiting for the true sunshine, fancy
   that there is no light either in heaven or earth, but that they are
   plunged in perpetual darkness. They are just like newly-weaned babes,
   who fret and languish for want of the breast, and are a weariness to
   every one, especially to themselves.

   Just so it fell out with a certain Geoffroy de Peronne, a member of S.
   Bernard's community, newly dedicated to God's Service, during a journey
   which he and some others were making. He became suddenly dry, deprived
   of all consolations, and amid his interior darkness he began to think
   of the friends and relations he had parted from, and of his worldly
   pursuits and interests, until the temptation grew so urgent that his
   outward aspect betrayed it, and one of those most in his confidence
   perceiving that he was sorely troubled, accosted him tenderly, asking
   him secretly, "What means this, Geoffroy? and what makes thee, contrary
   to thy wont, so pensive and sad?" Whereupon Geoffroy, sighing heavily,
   made answer, "Woe is me, my brother, never again in my life shall I be
   glad!"

   The other was moved to pity by these words, and in his fraternal love
   he hastened to tell it all to their common father S. Bernard, and he,
   realising the danger, went into the nearest church to pray for
   Geoffroy, who meanwhile cast himself down in despair, and, resting his
   head on a stone, fell asleep. After a while both rose up, the one full
   of grace won by prayer, the other from his sleep, with so peaceful and
   gladsome a countenance, that his friend, marvelling to see so great and
   unexpected a change, could not refrain from gently reproaching him for
   his recent words. Thereupon Geoffroy answered, "If just now I told thee
   that I should never more be glad, so now I promise thee I will never
   more be sad!" Such was the result of this devout man's temptation; but
   from this history I would have you observe:--

   1. That God is wont to give some foretaste of His heavenly joys to
   beginners in His Service, the better to wean them from earthly
   pleasures, and to encourage them in seeking His Divine Love, even as a
   mother attracts her babe to suck by means of honey.

   2. That nevertheless it is the same Good God Who sometimes in His
   Wisdom deprives us of the milk and honey of His consolations, in order
   that we may learn to eat the dry substantial bread of a vigorous
   devotion, trained by means of temptations and trials.

   3. That sometimes very grievous temptations arise out of dryness and
   barrenness, and that at such times these temptations must be stedfastly
   resisted, inasmuch as they are not of God; but the dryness must be
   patiently endured, because He sends that to prove us. 4. That we must
   never grow discouraged amid our inward trials, nor say, like Geoffroy,
   "I shall never be glad;" but through the darkness we must look for
   light; and in like manner, in the brightest spiritual sunshine, we must
   not presume to say, "I shall never be sad." Rather we must remember the
   saying of the Wise Man, "In the day of prosperity remember the evil."
   [200] It behoves us to hope amid trials, and to fear in prosperity, and
   in both circumstances always to be humble.

   5. That it is a sovereign remedy to open our grief to some spiritual
   friend able to assist us.

   And, in conclusion, I would observe that here, as everywhere, our
   Gracious God and our great Enemy are in conflict, for by means of these
   trials God would bring us to great purity of heart, to an entire
   renunciation of self-interest in all concerning His Service, and a
   perfect casting aside of self-seeking; but the Evil One seeks to use
   our troubles to our discouragement, so as to turn us back to sensual
   pleasures, and to make us a weariness to ourselves and others, in order
   to injure true devotion. But if you will give heed to the above
   instructions you will advance greatly towards perfection amid such
   interior trials, concerning which I have yet one word to say. Sometimes
   revulsions and dryness and incapacity proceed from bodily
   indisposition, as when excessive watching, 1 fasting, or overwork
   produce weariness, lassitude, heaviness, and the like; which, while
   wholly caused by the body, interfere greatly with the soul, so
   intimately are they linked together. When this is the case, you must
   always remember to make marked acts of virtue with your higher will,
   for, although your whole soul may seem to be sunk in drowsy weariness,
   such mental efforts are acceptable to God. At such a time you may say
   with the Bride of the Canticles, "I sleep, but my heart waketh." [201]
   And, as I have already said, if there is less enjoyment in such
   efforts, there is more virtue and merit. But the best remedy under the
   last-named circumstances is to reinvigorate the body by some lawful
   recreation and solace.

   S. Francis enjoined his religious to use such moderation in their
   labours as never to impair the fervour of their minds. And speaking of
   that great Saint, he was himself once attacked by such deep depression
   of mind that he could not conceal it; if he sought to associate with
   his religious he was unable to talk; if he kept apart he only grew
   worse; abstinence and maceration of the flesh overwhelmed him, and he
   found no comfort in prayer. For two years he continued in this state,
   as though altogether forsaken of God, but after humbly enduring the
   heavy storm, his Saviour restored him to a happy calm quite suddenly.

   From this we should learn that God's greatest servants are liable to
   such trials, so that less worthy people should not be surprised if they
   experience the same.

 PART V. CONTAINING COUNSELS AND PRACTICES FOR RENEWING AND CONFIRMING THE SOUL
                                  IN DEVOTION.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER I. It is well yearly to renew Good Resolutions by means of the following
Exercises.

   THE first point in these exercises is to appreciate their importance.
   Our earthly nature easily falls away from its higher tone by reason of
   the frailty and evil tendency of the flesh, oppressing and dragging
   down the soul, unless it is constantly rising up by means of a vigorous
   resolution, just as a bird would speedily fall to the ground if it did
   not maintain its flight by repeated strokes of its wings. In order to
   this, my daughter, you need frequently to reiterate the good
   resolutions you have made to serve God, for fear that, failing to do
   so, you fall away, not only to your former condition, but lower still;
   since it is a characteristic of all spiritual falls that they
   invariably throw us lower than we were at the beginning. There is no
   clock, however good, but must be continually wound up; and moreover,
   during the course of each year it will need taking to pieces, to
   cleanse away the rust which clogs it, to straighten bent works, and
   renew such as are worn. Even so, any one who really cares for his
   heart's devotion will wind it up to God night and morning, and examine
   into its condition, correcting and improving it; and at least once a
   year he will take the works to pieces and examine them carefully;--I
   mean his affections and passions,--so as to repair whatever may be
   amiss. And just as the clockmaker applies a delicate oil to all the
   wheels and springs of a clock, so that it may work properly and be less
   liable to rust, so the devout soul, after thus taking the works of his
   heart to pieces, will lubricate them with the Sacraments of Confession
   and the Eucharist. These exercises will repair the waste caused by
   time, will kindle your heart, revive your good resolutions, and cause
   the graces of your mind to flourish anew.

   The early Christians observed some such practice on the Anniversary of
   our Lord's Baptism, when, as S. Gregory, Bishop of Nazianzen, tells us,
   they renewed the profession and promises made in that Sacrament. It
   were well to do the like, my child, making due and earnest preparation,
   and setting very seriously to work.

   Having then chosen a suitable time, according to the advice of your
   spiritual father, and having retired somewhat more than usual into a
   literal and spiritual solitude, make one, two, or three meditations on
   the following points, according to the method I set before you in Part
   II.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER II. Meditation on the Benefit conferred on us by God in calling us to
His Service.

   1. CONSIDER the points on which you are about to renew your
   resolutions.

   Firstly, that you have forsaken, rejected, detested and renounced all
   mortal sin for ever.

   Secondly, that you have dedicated and consecrated your soul, heart and
   body, with everything appertaining thereto, to the Service and Love of
   God.

   Thirdly, that if you should unhappily fall into any sin, you would
   forthwith rise up again, with the help of God's Grace.

   Are not these worthy, right, noble resolutions? Consider well within
   your soul how holy, reasonable and desirable an act it is to renew
   them.

   2. Consider to Whom you make these promises; for if a deliberate
   promise made to men is strictly binding, how much more those which we
   make to God. "My heart is inditing of a good matter. I will not forget
   Thee," David cried out. [202]

   3. Consider before Whom you promised. It was before the whole Court of
   Heaven. The Blessed Virgin, S. Joseph, your Guardian Angel, S. Louis,
   the whole Company of the Blessed, were looking on with joy and
   approbation, beholding, with love unspeakable, your heart cast at your
   Saviour's Feet and dedicated to His Service. That act of yours called
   forth special delight in the Heavenly Jerusalem, and it will now be
   renewed if you on your part heartily renew your good resolutions.

   4. Consider how you were led to make those resolutions. How good and
   gracious God was then to you! Did He not draw you by the tender wiles
   of His Holy Spirit? Were not the sails by which your little bark was
   wafted into the haven of safety those of love and charity? Did not God
   lure you on with His Heavenly Sweetness, by Sacraments, prayer, and
   pious books? Ah, my child, while you slept God watched over you with
   His boundless Love, and breathed thoughts of peace into your heart!

   5. Consider when God led you to these important resolutions. It was in
   the flower of your life, and how great the blessing of learning early
   what we can never know soon enough. S. Augustine, who acquired that
   knowledge when he was thirty years old, exclaimed, "Oh, Thou Beauty of
   ancient days, yet ever new, too late I loved Thee! Thou wert within and
   I abroad: Thou wert with me, but I was not with Thee." [203] Even so
   you may say, "Oh, Blessedness of ancient days, wherefore did I not
   appreciate Thee sooner!" You were not yet worthy of it, and yet God
   gave you such grace in your youth;--therefore say with David, "Thou, O
   God, hast taught me from my youth up until now; therefore will I tell
   of Thy wondrous works." [204] Or if you who read should not have known
   Him till old age, bethink you how great His Grace in calling you after
   you had wasted so many years; how gracious the Mercy which drove you
   from your evil courses before the hour of death, which, had it found
   you unchanged, must have brought you eternal woe.

   Consider the results of this call; you will surely find a change for
   the better, comparing what you are with what you were. Is it not a
   blessing to know how to talk with God in prayer, to desire to love Him,
   to have stilled and subdued sundry passions which disturbed you, to
   have conquered sundry sins and perplexities, and to have received so
   many more Communions than formerly, thereby being united to the Great
   Source of all eternal grace? Are not all these things exceeding
   blessings? Weigh them, my child, in the balances of the sanctuary, for
   it is God's Right Hand which has done all this: "The Right Hand of the
   Lord hath the pre-eminence, the Right Hand of the Lord bringeth mighty
   things to pass. I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the
   Lord" [205] with heart, lips and deeds.

   After dwelling upon all these considerations, which will kindle
   abundance of lively affections in you, you should conclude simply with
   an act of thanksgiving, and a hearty prayer that they may bring forth
   fruit, leaving off with great humility and trust in God, and reserving
   the final results of your resolution till after the second point of
   this spiritual exercise.

CHAPTER III. Examination of the Soul as to its Progress in the Devout Life.

   THIS second point is somewhat lengthy, and I would begin by saying that
   there is no need for you to carry it out all at once. Divide it by
   taking your conduct towards God at one time, all that concerns yourself
   another time, all that concerns your neighbour, and fourthly, the
   examination of your passions. It is neither necessary nor expedient
   that you make it upon your knees, always excepting the beginning and
   the end, which includes the affections. The other points of
   self-examination you may make profitably when out walking, or better
   still, in bed, that is, if you can keep wide awake and free from
   drowsiness; but to do this you must read them over carefully
   beforehand. Anyhow, it is desirable to go through this second point in
   three days and two nights at the most, taking that season which you can
   best manage; for if you go through it at too distant intervals you will
   lose the depth of impression which ought to be made by this spiritual
   exercise. After each point of examination observe wherein you have
   failed, and what is lacking to you, and in what you have chiefly
   failed, so that you may be able to explain your troubles, get counsel
   and comfort, and make fresh resolutions. It is not necessary entirely
   to shun all society on the days you select for this work, but you must
   contrive a certain amount of retirement, especially in the evening, so
   as to get to bed somewhat earlier than usual, with a view to that rest,
   bodily and mental, which is so important for serious thought. And
   during the day make frequent aspirations to Our Lord, Our Lady, the
   Angels, and all the Heavenly Jerusalem. Everything must be done with a
   heart full of God's Love, and an earnest desire for spiritual
   perfection. To begin this examination,--

   1. Place yourself in the Presence of God.

   2. Invoke the Holy Spirit, and ask light of Him, so that you may know
   yourself, as S. Augustine did, crying out, "Lord, teach me to know
   Thee, and to know myself;" and S. Francis, who asked, "Who art Thou,
   Lord, and who am I?" Resolve not to note any progress with any
   self-satisfaction or self-glorification, but give the glory to God
   Alone, and thank Him duly for it.

   Resolve, too, that if you should seem to yourself to have made but
   little progress, or even to have gone back, that you will not be
   discouraged thereby, nor grow cool or indolent in the matter; but that,
   on the contrary, you will take fresh pains to humble yourself and
   conquer your faults, with God's Help.

   Then go on to examine quietly and patiently how you have conducted
   yourself towards God, your neighbour and yourself, up to the present
   time.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER IV. Examination of the Soul's Condition as regards God.

   1. WHAT is the aspect of your heart with respect to mortal sin? Are you
   firmly resolved never to commit it, let come what may? And have you
   kept that resolution from the time you first made it? Therein lies the
   foundation of the spiritual life.

   2. What is your position with respect to the Commandments of God? Are
   they acceptable, light and easy to you? He who has a good digestion and
   healthy appetite likes good food, and turns away from that which is
   bad.

   3. How do you stand as regards venial sins? No one can help committing
   some such occasionally; but are there none to which you have any
   special tendency, or worse still, any actual liking and clinging?

   4. With respect to spiritual exercises--do you like and value them? or
   do they weary and vex you? To which do you feel most or least disposed,
   hearing or reading God's Word, meditating upon it, calling upon God,
   Confession, preparing for Communion and communicating, controlling your
   inclinations, etc.? What of all these is most repugnant to you? And if
   you find that your heart is not disposed to any of these things,
   examine into the cause, find out whence the disinclination comes.

   5. With respect to God Himself--does your heart delight in thinking of
   God, does it crave after the sweetness thereof? "I remembered Thine
   everlasting judgments, O Lord, and received comfort," says David. [206]
   Do you feel a certain readiness to love Him, and a definite inclination
   to enjoy His Love? Do you take pleasure in dwelling upon the Immensity,
   the Goodness, the Tenderness of God? When you are immersed in the
   occupations and vanities of this world, does the thought of God come
   across you as a welcome thing? do you accept it gladly, and yield
   yourself up to it, and your heart turn with a sort of yearning to Him?
   There are souls that do so.

   6. If a wife has been long separated from her husband, so soon as she
   sees him returning, and hears his voice, however cumbered she may be
   with business, or forcibly hindered by the pressure of circumstances,
   her heart knows no restraint, but turns at once from all else to think
   upon him she loves. So it is with souls which really love God, however
   engrossed they may be; when the thought of Him is brought before them,
   they forget all else for joy at feeling His Dear Presence nigh, and
   this is a very good sign.

   7. With respect to Jesus Christ as God and Man--how does your heart
   draw to Him? Honey bees seek their delight in their honey, but wasps
   hover over stinking carrion. Even so pious souls draw all their joy
   from Jesus Christ, and love Him with an exceeding sweet Love, but those
   who are careless find their pleasure in worldly vanities.

   8. With respect to Our Lady, the Saints, and your Guardian Angel--do
   you love them well? Do you rejoice in the sense of their guardianship?
   Do you take pleasure in their lives, their pictures, their memories?

   9. As to your tongue--how do you speak of God? Do you take pleasure in
   speaking His Praise, and singing His Glory in psalms and hymns?

   10. As to actions--have you God's visible glory at heart, and do you
   delight in doing whatever you can to honour Him? Those who love God
   will love to adorn and beautify His House. Are you conscious of having
   ever given up anything you liked, or of renouncing anything for God's
   Sake? for it is a good sign when we deprive ourselves of something we
   care for on behalf of those we love. What have you ever given up for
   the Love of God?

CHAPTER V. Examination of your Condition as regards yourself.

   1. HOW do you love yourself? Is it a love which concerns this life
   chiefly? If so, you will desire to abide here for ever, and you will
   diligently seek your worldly establishment,--but if the love you bear
   yourself has a heavenward tendency, you will long, or, at all events
   you will be ready to go hence whensoever it may please our Lord.

   2. Is your love of yourself well regulated? for nothing is more ruinous
   than an inordinate love of self. A well-regulated love implies greater
   care for the soul than for the body; more eagerness in seeking after
   holiness than aught else; a greater value for heavenly glory than for
   any mean earthly honour. A well regulated heart much oftener asks
   itself, "What will the angels say if I follow this or that line of
   conduct?" than what will men say.

   3. What manner of love do you bear to your own heart? Are you willing
   to minister to it in its maladies? for indeed you are bound to succour
   it, and seek help for it when harassed by passion, and to leave all
   else till that is done.

   4. What do you imagine yourself worth in God's Sight? Nothing,
   doubtless, nor is there any great humility in the fly which confesses
   it is nought, as compared with a mountain, or a drop of water, which
   knows itself to be nothing compared with the sea, or a cornflower, or a
   spark, as compared with the sun. But humility consists in not esteeming
   ourselves above other men, and in not seeking to be esteemed above
   them. How is it with you in this respect?

   5. In speech--do you never boast in any way? Do you never indulge in
   self-flattery when speaking of yourself?

   6. In deed--do you indulge in anything prejudicial to your health,--I
   mean useless idle pleasures, unprofitable night-watches, and the like?
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VI. Examination of the Soul's Condition as regards our Neighbour.

   HUSBAND and wife are bound to love one another with a tender, abiding,
   restful love, and this tie stands foremost by God's order and Will. And
   I say the same with respect to children and all near relations, as also
   friends in their respective degrees. But, generally speaking, how is it
   with you as concerning your neighbour? Do you love him cordially, and
   for God's Sake? In order to answer this fairly, you must call to mind
   sundry disagreeable, annoying people, for it is in such cases that we
   really practise the Love of God with respect to our neighbours, and
   still more towards them that do us wrong, either by word or deed.
   Examine whether your heart is thoroughly clear as regards all such, and
   whether it costs you a great effort to love them. Are you quick to
   speak ill of your neighbours, especially of such as do not love you? Do
   you act unkindly in any way, directly or indirectly, towards them? A
   very little honest self-dealing will enable you to find this out.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VII. Examination as to the Affectations of the Soul.

   I HAVE dwelt thus at length on these points, on a due examination of
   which all true knowledge of our spiritual progress rests; as to an
   examination of sins, that rather pertains to the confessions of those
   who are not eager to advance. But it is well to take ourselves to task
   soberly concerning these different matters, investigating how we have
   been going on since we made good resolutions concerning them, and what
   notable faults we have committed. But the summary of all is to examine
   into our passions; and if you are worried by so detailed an
   investigation as that already suggested, you may make a briefer inquiry
   as to what you have been, and how you have acted, in some such manner
   as this:--In your love of God, your neighbour, and yourself.

   In hatred for the sin which is in yourself, for the sin which you find
   in others, since you ought to desire the extirpation of both; in your
   desires concerning riches, pleasure, and honour.

   In fear of the perils of sin, and of the loss of this world's goods; we
   fear the one too much and the other too little.

   In hope, fixed overmuch it may be on things of this world and the
   creature; too little on God and things eternal.

   In sadness, whether it be excessive concerning unimportant matters.

   In gladness, whether it be excessive concerning unworthy objects.

   In short, examine what attachments hinder your spiritual life, what
   passions engross it, and what chiefly attracts you.

   It is by testing the passions of the soul, one by one, that we
   ascertain our spiritual condition, just as one who plays the lute tries
   every string, touching those which are discordant, either raising or
   lowering them. Thus having tried our soul as to love, hate, desire,
   fear, hope, sadness and joy, if we find our strings out of tune for the
   melody we wish to raise, which is God's Glory, we must tune them afresh
   with the help of His Grace, and the counsel of our spiritual father.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VIII. The Affections to be excited after such Examination.

   WHEN you have quietly gone through each point of this examination, and
   have ascertained your own position, you will excite certain feelings
   and affections in your heart. Thank God for such amendment, however
   slight, as you may have found in yourself, confessing that it is the
   work of His Mercy Alone in you.

   Humble yourself deeply before God, confessing that if your progress has
   been but small, it is your own fault, for not having corresponded
   faithfully, bravely and continually to the inspirations and lights
   which He has given you in prayer or otherwise.

   Promise to praise Him for ever for the graces He has granted to you,
   and because He has led you against your will to make even this small
   progress.

   Ask forgiveness for the disloyalty and faithlessness with which you
   have answered Him.

   Offer your whole heart to Him that He Alone may rule therein. Entreat
   Him to keep you faithful to Himself.

   Ponder over the examples of the Saints, the Blessed Virgin, your
   guardian Angel and patron Saint, S. Joseph, etc.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER IX. Reflections suitable to the renewal of Good Resolutions.

   AFTER you have made this self-examination, and having conferred with
   some holy director as to your shortcomings and their remedies, you will
   do well to pursue the following considerations, taking one daily as a
   meditation, and giving to it the time usually so spent; always making
   the same preparation and kindling the same affections as you learnt to
   use before meditating in Part I. Above all, placing yourself in the
   Presence of God, and earnestly asking His Grace to confirm you and keep
   you stedfast in His Holy Love and Service.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER X. First Consideration--of the Worth of Souls.

   CONSIDER how noble and excellent a thing your soul is, endowed with
   understanding, capable of knowing, not merely this visible world around
   us, but Angels and Paradise, of knowing that there is an All-Mighty,
   All-Merciful, Ineffable God; of knowing that eternity lies before you,
   and of knowing what is necessary in order so to live in this visible
   world as to attain to fellowship with those Angels in Paradise, and the
   eternal fruition of God.

   Yet more;---your soul is possessed of a noble will, capable of loving
   God, irresistibly drawn to that love; your heart is full of generous
   enthusiasm, and can no more find rest in any earthly creation, or in
   aught save God, than the bee can find honey on a dunghill, or in aught
   save flowers. Let your mind boldly review the wild earthly pleasures
   which once filled your heart, and see whether they did not abound in
   uneasiness and doubts, in painful thoughts and uncomfortable cares,
   amid which your troubled heart was miserable.

   When the heart of man seeks the creature, it goes to work eagerly,
   expecting to satisfy its cravings; but directly it obtains what it
   sought, it finds a blank, and dissatisfied, begins to seek anew; for
   God will not suffer our hearts to find any rest, like the dove going
   forth from Noah's ark, until it returns to God, whence it came. Surely
   this is a most striking natural beauty in our heart;--why should we
   constrain it against its will to seek creature love?

   In some such wise might you address your soul: "You are capable of
   realising a longing after God, why should you trifle with anything
   lower? you can live for eternity, why should you stop short in time?
   One of the sorrows of the prodigal son was, that, when he might have
   been living in plenty at his father's table, he had brought himself to
   share the swine's husks. My soul, you are made for God, woe be to you
   if you stop short in anything short of Him!" Lift up your soul with
   thoughts such as these, convince it that it is eternal, and worthy of
   eternity; fill it with courage in this pursuit.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XI. Second Consideration--on the Excellence of Virtue.

   CONSIDER that nothing save holiness and devotion can satisfy your soul
   in this world: behold how gracious they are; draw a contrast between
   each virtue and its opposite vice; how gracious patience is compared
   with vengeance; gentleness compared with anger; humility with pride and
   arrogance; liberality with avarice; charity with envy; sobriety with
   unsteadiness. It is one charm of all virtues that they fill the soul
   with untold sweetness after being practised, whereas vice leaves it
   harassed and ill at ease. Who would not speedily set to work and obtain
   such sweetness?

   In the matter of evil, he who has a little is not contented, and he who
   has much is discontented; but he who has a little virtue is gladsome,
   and his gladness is for ever greater as he goes on. O devout life! you
   are indeed lovely, sweet and pleasant; you can soften sorrows and
   sweeten consolations; without you good becomes evil, pleasure is marred
   by anxiety and distress: verily whoso knows what you are may well say
   with the woman of Samaria, "Lord, give me this water," [207] an
   aspiration often uttered by Saint Theresa and Saint Catherine of Genoa.

CHAPTER XII. The Example of the Saints.

   CONSIDER the example of the Saints on all sides, what have they not
   done in order to love God and lead a devout life? Call to mind the
   Martyrs in their invincible firmness, and the tortures they endured in
   order to maintain their resolutions; remember the matrons and maidens,
   whiter than lilies in their purity, ruddier than the rose in their
   love, who at every age, from childhood upward, bore all manner of
   martyrdom sooner than forsake their resolutions, not only such as
   concerned their profession of faith, but that of devotion; some dying
   rather than lose their virginity, others rather than cease their works
   of mercy to the sick and sorrowful. Truly the frail sex has set forth
   no small courage in such ways. Consider all the Saintly Confessors, how
   heartily they despised the world, and how they stood by their
   resolutions, taken unreservedly and kept inviolably. Remember what S.
   Augustine says of his mother Monica, of her determination to serve God
   in her married life and in her widowhood; and S. Jerome and his beloved
   daughter S. Paula amid so many changes and chances. What may we not
   achieve with such patterns before our eyes? They were but what we are,
   they wrought for the same God, seeking the same graces; why may not we
   do as much in our own state of life, and according to our several
   vocations, on behalf of our most cherished resolutions and holy
   profession of faith?
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XIII. The Love which Jesus Christ bears to us.

   CONSIDER the Love with which our Dear Lord Jesus Christ bore so much in
   this world, especially in the Garden of Olives and on Mount Calvary;
   that Love bore you in mind, and through all those pains and toils He
   obtained your good resolutions for you, as also all that is needful to
   maintain, foster, strengthen and consummate those resolutions. How
   precious must the resolutions be which are the fruits of our Lord's
   Passion! and how dear to my heart, since they were dear to that of
   Jesus! Saviour of my soul, Thou didst die to win them for me; grant me
   grace sooner to die than forget them. Be sure, my daughter, that the
   Heart of our most Dear Lord beheld you from the tree of the Cross and
   loved you, and by that Love He won for you all good things which you
   were ever to have, and amongst them your good resolutions. Of a truth
   we have all reason like Jeremiah to confess that the Lord knew us, and
   called us by our name or ever we were born, [208] the more that His
   Divine Goodness in its Love and Mercy made ready all things, general
   and individual, which could promote our salvation, and among them our
   resolutions. A woman with child makes ready for the babe she expects,
   prepares its cradle, its swaddling clothes and its nurse; even so our
   Lord, while hanging on His Cross, prepared all that you could need for
   your happiness, all the means, the graces, the leadings, by which He
   leads your soul onwards towards perfection.

   Surely we ought ever to remember this, and ask fervently: Is it
   possible that I was loved, and loved so tenderly by my Saviour, that He
   should have thought of me individually, and in all these details by
   which He has drawn me to Himself? With what love and gratitude ought I
   to use all He has given me? The Loving Heart of my God thought of my
   soul, loved it, and prepared endless means to promote its salvation,
   even as though there were no other soul on earth of which He thought;
   just as the sun shines on each spot of earth as brightly as though it
   shone nowhere else, but reserved all its brightness for that alone. So
   Our Dear Lord thought and cared for every one of His children as though
   none other existed. "Who loved me, and gave Himself for me," [209] S.
   Paul says, as though he meant, "for me alone, as if there were none but
   me He cared for."

   Let this be graven in your soul, my child, the better to cherish and
   foster your good resolutions, which are so precious to the Heart of
   Jesus.

CHAPTER XIV. The Eternal Love of God for us.

   CONSIDER the Eternal Love God has borne you, in that, even before our
   Lord Jesus Christ became Man and suffered on the Cross for you, His
   Divine Majesty designed your existence and loved you. When did He begin
   to love you? When He began to be God, and that was never, for He ever
   was, without beginning and without end. Even so He always loved you
   from eternity, and therefore He made ready all the graces and gifts
   with which He has endowed you. He says by His prophet, "I have loved
   thee" (and it is YOU that He means) "with an everlasting love,
   therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee." [210] And amid these
   drawings of His Love He led you to make these resolutions to serve Him.

   What must resolutions be which God has foreseen, pondered, dwelt upon
   from all eternity? how dear and precious to us! Surely we should be
   ready to suffer anything whatsoever rather than let go one particle of
   the same. The whole world is not worth one soul, and the soul is worth
   but little without its good resolutions.

   [210] Jer. xxxi. 3.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XV. General Affections which should result from these Considerations,
and Conclusion of the Exercise.

   O PRECIOUS resolutions! ye are as the lovely tree of life planted by
   God's Own Hand in the midst of my heart, a tree which my Saviour has
   watered with His Blood. Rather would I die a thousand deaths than
   suffer any blast of wind to root you up--neither vanity, nor pleasure,
   nor wealth, nor sorrows shall ever overthrow my intentions.

   Lord, Thou hast planted and nurtured this tree in Thy Bosom, but how
   many souls there are which have not been thus favoured, how can I ever
   sufficiently acknowledge Thy Mercy? Blessed and holy resolutions, if I
   do but keep you, you will keep me! if you live in my soul, my soul will
   live in you. Live ever, then, ye resolutions, which have an eternity of
   your own in God's Mercy, live ever in me, and may I never forsake you.

   Next, you must particularise the necessary means for maintaining your
   good resolutions, determining to use them diligently,--such as
   frequency in prayer, in Sacraments, in good works; the amendment of the
   faults you have already discovered, cutting off occasions of sin, and
   following out carefully all the advice given you with this view. Then,
   take breath as it were in a renewed profession of your resolutions,
   and, as though you held your heart in your hands,--dedicate,
   consecrate, sacrifice, immolate it to God, vowing never to recall it,
   but leave it for ever in His Right Hand of Majesty, prepared everywhere
   and in all things to obey His Commands. Ask God to renew your will, to
   bless your renewed resolutions and to strengthen them. While your heart
   is thus roused and excited, hasten to your spiritual father, accuse
   yourself of any faults which you have discovered since you made your
   general confession, and receive absolution as you did at the first.
   Make your protest and sign it in his presence, and then lose no time in
   uniting your renewed heart to its Creator and Saviour, in the most holy
   Sacrament of the Eucharist.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XVI. The Impressions which should remain after this Exercise.

   ON the day you make this renewal of your resolutions, and on those
   immediately following, you should often repeat with heart and voice the
   earnest words of S. Paul, S. Augustine, S. Catherine of Genoa, and
   others like-minded, "I am not mine own, whether I live or whether I
   die, I am the Lord's. There is no longer any me or mine, my me' is
   Jesus, my mine' is to be His. Thou world, wilt ever be thyself, and
   hitherto I have been myself, but henceforth I will be so no more." We
   shall indeed not be ourselves any more, for our heart will be changed,
   and the world which has so often deceived us will in its turn be
   deceived in us; our change will be so gradual that the world will still
   suppose us to be Esau, while really we are Jacob.

   All our devout exercises must sink into the heart, and when we come
   forth from our meditation and retirement it behoves us to tread warily
   in business or society, lest the wine of our good resolutions be
   heedlessly spilt; rather let it soak in and penetrate every faculty of
   the soul, but quietly, and without bodily or mental excitement.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XVII. An Answer to Two Objections which may be made to this Book.

   THE world will tell you, my child, that all these counsels and
   practices are so numerous, that anybody who tries to heed them can pay
   no attention to anything else. Verily, my dear daughter, if we did
   nothing else we should not be far wrong, since we should be doing all
   that we ought to do in this world. But you see the fallacy? If all
   these exercises were to be performed every day they would undoubtedly
   fill up all our time, but it is only necessary to use them according to
   time and place as they are wanted. What a quantity of laws there are in
   our civil codes and digests! But they are only called into use from
   time to time, as circumstances arise, not every day. Besides, for that
   matter, David, king as he was, and involved in a multiplicity of
   complicated affairs, fulfilled more religious duties than those which I
   have suggested; and S. Louis, a monarch unrivalled in time of peace or
   war, who was most diligent in the administration of justice and in
   ruling his country, nevertheless was wont to hear two masses daily, to
   say vespers and compline with his chaplain, and to make his meditation
   daily. He used to visit the hospitals every Friday, was regular at
   confession, took the discipline, often attended sermons and spiritual
   conferences, and withal he never lost any opportunity of promoting the
   public welfare, and his court was more flourishing and notable than
   that of any of his predecessors. Be bold and resolute then in
   performing the spiritual exercises I have set before you, and God will
   give you time and strength for all other duties, yea, even if He were
   to cause the sun to stand still, as He did in Joshua's time. [211] We
   are sure always to do enough when God works with us.

   Moreover, the world will say that I take it for granted that those I
   address have the gift of mental prayer, which nevertheless every one
   does not possess, and that consequently this book will not be of use to
   all. Doubtless it is true that I have assumed this, and it is also true
   that every one has not the gift of mental prayer, but it is a gift
   which almost every one can obtain, even the most ignorant, provided
   they are under a good director, and will take as much pains as the
   thing deserves to acquire it. And if there are any altogether devoid of
   this gift (which I believe will very rarely be the case), a wise
   spiritual father will easily teach them how to supply the deficiency,
   by reading or listening to the meditations and considerations supplied
   in this book or elsewhere.

CHAPTER XVIII. Three Important and Final Counsels.

   ON the first day of every month renew the resolution given in Part I.
   after meditation, and make continual protestation of your intention to
   keep it, saying with David, "I will never forget Thy Commandments, for
   with them Thou hast quickened me." [212] And whenever you feel any
   deterioration in your spiritual condition, take out your protest, and
   prostrating yourself in a humble spirit, renew it heartily, and you
   will assuredly find great relief.

   Make open profession of your desire to be devout; I will not say to be
   devout, but to desire it; and do not be ashamed of the ordinary,
   needful actions which lead us on in the Love of God. Acknowledge boldly
   that you try to meditate, that you would rather die than commit a
   mortal sin; that you frequent the Sacraments, and follow the advice of
   your director (although for various reasons it may not be necessary to
   mention his name). This open confession that you intend to serve God,
   and that you have devoted yourself deliberately and heartily to His
   Holy Love, is very acceptable to His Divine Majesty, for He would not
   have any of us ashamed of Him or of His Cross. Moreover, it cuts at the
   root of many a hindrance which the world tries to throw in our way, and
   so to say, commits us to the pursuit of holiness. The philosophers of
   old used to give themselves out as such, in order to be left unmolested
   in their philosophic life; and we ought to let it be known that we aim
   at devotion in order that we may be suffered to live devoutly. And if
   any one affirms that you can live a devout life without following all
   these practices and counsels, do not deny it, but answer meekly that
   your infirmity is great, and needs more help and support than many
   others may require.

   Finally, my beloved child, I intreat you by all that is sacred in
   heaven and in earth, by your own Baptism, by the breast which Jesus
   sucked, by the tender Heart with which He loves you, and by the bowels
   of compassion in which you hope--be stedfast and persevere in this most
   blessed undertaking to live a devout life. Our days pass away, death is
   at hand. "The trumpet sounds a recall," says S. Gregory Nazianzen, "in
   order that every one may make ready, for Judgment is near." When S.
   Symphorian was led to his martyrdom, his mother cried out to him, "My
   son, my son, remember life eternal, look to Heaven, behold Him Who
   reigns there; for the brief course of this life will soon be ended."
   Even so would I say to you: Look to Heaven, and do not lose it for
   earth; look at Hell, and do not plunge therein for the sake of this
   passing life; look at Jesus Christ, and do not deny Him for the world's
   sake; amid if the devout life sometimes seems hard and dull, join in
   Saint Francis' song, [213] --

   "So vast the joys that I await,

   No earthly travail seemeth great."

   Glory be to Jesus, to Whom, with the Father and the Holy Ghost, be
   honour and glory, now and ever, and to all Eternity. Amen.

   Sales renders-- "A cause des biens que j'attends, Les travaux me sont
   passe-temps."
