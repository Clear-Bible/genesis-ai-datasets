   TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE

   The Commentaries of Calvin on the Epistles of Paul are generally
   considered to be among the most successful of his Expositions of
   Scripture. In the writings, indeed, of one whose vast powers have been
   applied to the exposition of nearly the whole of the Inspired Volume,
   and whose rare endowments, as an interpreter of Scripture, have drawn
   forth expressions of the profoundest admiration even from the most
   inveterate adversaries of the system of doctrine maintained by him,
   there is room for some diversity of opinion as to the particular
   portions of Divine truth which he has most successfully expounded. It
   is mentioned by M. Teissier, in his extracts from M. de Thou's History,
   [1] that "although all the works of Calvin have merited the esteem of
   persons of good taste, he has in the opinion of some succeeded best in
   unfolding the doctrine of Providence," while, according to Joseph
   Scaliger, who "reckoned Calvin to have had a divine genius, and to have
   excelled in the explication of Scripture, so that no one among the
   ancients could be compared" to him, "the best of his theological
   treatises was his Commentary on Daniel."

   While, however, there may be some difference of opinion among the many
   admirers of Calvin as to the particular portion of his expository
   writings, in which his vast powers shine forth to most advantage, there
   can be no question that his expositions of the Epistles of Paul are
   singularly felicitous. It is stated by Tholuck, in his view of Calvin
   as an interpreter of the Holy Scriptures, that among his Commentaries
   on the new Testament, "those on the Epistles of Paul are by far the
   best," and that "in the Pauline Epistles, he merges himself in the
   spirit of the Apostle, and becoming one with him, as every one clearly
   feels, he deduces everywhere the explanation of that which is
   particular from that which is general." [2] A similar view of the
   peculiar excellence of Calvin's expositions of the Epistles of Paul is
   given by Böhmer, of Berlin, in his introduction to the Epistle to the
   Colossians, (as quoted by the late Dr. Pye Smith, in his encomium on
   the writings of Calvin.) "John Calvin well merited the epithet, often
   given to him, of The Great Divine. Independent, in the highest degree,
   of other men, he most often discerns, with piercing eye, the spiritual
   mind of Paul, and with his masterly command of language, makes it so
   clear, that both the most learned student of theology, and the plain
   affectionate believer, are equally benefited and satisfied." [3]

   That the Expository Treatises of Calvin on Paul's Epistles should be
   considered by the most eminent critics to be peculiarly successful is
   the more remarkable, when we take into view the disadvantageous
   circumstances under which most, if not all, of them were prepared. His
   Commentaries on six of Paul's Epistles were written by him (as we are
   informed by Beza, in his Life of Calvin [4] ) in 1548, a year of most
   harassing conflict with the enemies of the truth. His Correspondence,
   however, at this period, clearly shews that his devout mind found
   tranquility in an assurance of Divine support. In writing to Brentius,
   who was then living in exile at Basle, he says: "Amidst all these
   calamities one consideration supports and refreshes my mind: I assure
   myself that God, in commencing the wonderful restoration of his Church,
   which we have witnessed, has not held out a vain and transient hope to
   us, but has begun a work that he will not fail to accomplish in spite
   of the malice of men and the opposition of Satan. In the meantime let
   us patiently undergo the purification which is necessary for us." [5]
   It manifestly appears, also, from the Dedicatory Epistle prefixed to
   his Commentaries on four of Paul's Epistles, addressed to Christopher,
   Duke of Wirtemberg, that he had found the Epistles of Paul peculiarly
   consoling to his mind amidst outward troubles. Calvin is thought,
   indeed, to have had a marked resemblance in disposition and character
   to the great Apostle of the Gentiles, so that he has been termed by an
   eloquent writer, [6] "the Paul of the Reformation," -- a circumstance
   which is thought to have contributed to render him more successful in
   the exposition of Paul's' Epistles, while, as is justly observed by the
   Translator of Calvin on Galatians and Ephesians in the Biblical
   Cabinet, (vol. 30.) "the chief cause unquestionably lay in his
   singularly clear perception of that system of doctrine which Paul was
   honored to declare."

   The Epistle To The Philippians stands associated with a most
   interesting event in the history of the progress of Christianity. While
   the charge given to the Apostles as to the universal promulgation of
   the Gospel was most explicit, it was in a gradual manner, and for the
   most part under the guidance of circumstances seemingly fortuitous,
   that their sphere of labor was extended. "Beginning at Jerusalem,"
   (Luke 24:47,) as expressly instructed by their Master, they would, to
   all appearance, have continued to pursue their labors in and around
   that city, had not occurrences taken place from time to time, and
   these, too, of an untoward nature, considered in themselves, which led
   them to extend the benefits of the Gospel to countries more and more
   remote from their original sphere of labor.

   Philippi was the first place in Europe in which the Gospel of Christ
   was proclaimed, and it is sufficiently manifest from Luke's narrative,
   that the introduction of the Gospel at that time into Europe was not
   the result of any preconcerted plan on the part of the Apostles
   themselves. Had they been left to their own choice, they would, it
   appears, have disseminated the Gospel in Bithynia, or some other
   province of Asia Minor; but, instead of this, they were specially
   directed by the Spirit of God to "come over into Macedonia," (Acts
   16:9,) by which means the Gospel was for the first time introduced into
   Europe. And when we consider the important place which Europe has held
   during so many ages in connection with the progress of Christianity,
   and more especially the high honor assigned to European Christians, as
   being chiefly instrumental in its diffusion throughout the world, we
   cannot fail to mark with deep interest the circumstances connected with
   the first preaching of the Gospel at Philippi. "The little rill," says
   Foster, "near the source of one of the great American rivers, is an
   interesting object to the traveler, who is apprized, as he steps across
   it, or walks a few miles along its bank, that this is the stream which
   runs so far, and which gradually swells into so immense a flood." [7]
   For a similar reason, the preaching of the Gospel by Paul in the
   hearing of a few women by a river's side near Philippi, trivial as the
   circumstance may appear in itself, becomes invested with the deepest
   interest, when viewed in connection with the state and prospects of
   Christianity at the present day.

   While Luke makes mention only of two individuals -- Lydia and the
   Jailer -- with their respective households, as the fruits of the first
   preaching of the Gospel at Philippi, it clearly appears, from the
   Epistle to the Philippians, that from these small beginnings a
   flourishing Christian Church had sprung up, which, at the time when the
   Epistle was written, was in so prosperous a state, that the Apostle,
   who reproves so sharply the Churches of Corinth and Galatia, finds no
   occasion for censuring the Philippians, but commends in the highest
   terms their exemplary deportment.

   Philippi was originally called Crenides, from the numerous fountains of
   water in its neighborhood, and afterwards Dathos, or Datos, from its
   gold and silver mines. The city received the name of Philippi from
   Philip, father of Alexander the Great, by whom it was rebuilt and
   greatly enlarged. It is celebrated in profane history, as is noticed by
   Calvin in the Argument on the Epistle to the Philippians, for a signal
   victory which was gained by Octavius, afterwards Augustus Cæsar, and
   Antony over Brutus and Cassius; and it is not a little remarkable, that
   a city which was the scene of a victory that decided the fate of the
   Roman Empire, should have been afterwards illustrious as the scene of a
   nobler victory, intimately connected with the signal triumph of the
   Gospel in Europe.

   The Epistle bears evidence of having been written by Paul when a
   prisoner for the sake of Christ; and there seems every reason to
   believe that it was written by him during his first imprisonment at
   Rome. Dr. Paley, in his Horæ Paulinæ, adduces a variety of arguments,
   founded on incidental notices in the Epistle itself, to prove that it
   was written "near the conclusion of St. Paul's imprisonment at Rome,
   and after a residence in that city of considerable duration." It is
   generally believed to have been written about A.D. 62. The Epistle
   "breathes," says Barnes, "the spirit of a ripe Christian, whose piety
   was mellowing for the harvest; of one who felt that he was not far from
   heaven, and might soon be with Christ ... At the mercy of such a man as
   Nero; a prisoner; among strangers, and with death staring him in the
   face, it is natural to suppose that there would be a peculiar
   solemnity, tenderness, pathos, and ardor of affection breathing through
   the entire Epistle. Such is the fact; and in none of the writings of
   Paul are these qualities more apparent than in this letter to the
   Philippians."

   The Epistle To The Colossians is generally supposed to have been
   written by PAUL about A.D. 62, in the ninth year of the reign of the
   Emperor Nero. It bears evidence of having been written during Paul's
   first imprisonment at Rome. The Apostle, in the course of the Epistle,
   makes repeated allusions to the circumstance of his being at the time
   in "bonds" (Colossians 4:18) for the sake of Christ. Colosse (or, as
   several ancient manuscripts read, Colassæ) was, at the time when the
   Epistle to the Colossians was written, a flourishing city in the south
   of Phrygia, situated most picturesquely under the immense range of
   Mount Cadmus, and near the confluence of the rivers Lycus and Meander;
   but, about a year after Paul's Epistle was written, was, along with the
   neighboring cities of Laodicea and Hierapolis, destroyed by an
   earthquake, as is noticed by Calvin in the Argument of the Epistle. The
   site of the ancient city, the only remaining vestiges of which consist
   of arches, vaults, squared stones, and broken pottery, is now occupied
   by the village of Khonas, in which, as stated by the General Assembly's
   Deputation to Palestine in 1839, "a band of about thirty Greek
   Christians are found." [8]

   It has been matter of controversy by whom the Church of Colosse was
   planted. Dr. Lardner adduces a variety of considerations tending to
   shew that it was founded by Paul, chiefly the following: --That as Paul
   was twice in Phrygia, as stated by Luke, (Acts 16:6, and 18:23,) it is
   extremely probable, that on one or other of those occasions he was at
   Colosse, and planted a Church there; that he expresses himself toward
   the close of the first chapter in such terms as seem to imply that he
   had himself dispensed the Gospel to the Colossians, and that the
   general tenor of the Epistle seems to indicate that he is not writing
   to strangers, but to persons with whom he had been personally
   conversant, and to whom he had been, under God, the instrument of
   conversion. On the other hand, many distinguished commentators are of
   opinion that the Church of Colosse was not founded by Paul. Calvin, in
   the Argument of the Epistle, speaks of the Colossians as having been
   instructed in the Gospel, not by Paul, but by Epaphras and other
   Ministers. Hug and Koppe are decidedly of opinion that Paul did not
   plant the Church of Colosse, and had no personal acquaintance with the
   Christians there. Davenant is of opinion that the Church of Colosse was
   planted by Epaphras. Byfield, in his Exposition of the Colossians,
   thinks it probable that the Church of Colosse was planted, not by Paul,
   but by Epaphras or Archippus. Doddridge thinks the Epistle "contains no
   argument from whence it can certainly be inferred that he" (PAUL) "was
   personally acquainted with the Colossians." Scott, in his Preface to
   the Epistle, gives it as his "decided opinion, that the evidence
   against the Apostle's having been at Colosse is far stronger than any
   that has been adduced on the affirmative side of the question." In
   short, there is no inconsiderable force in the arguments adduced on
   both sides, and "uncertainty still lies on the dispute whether Paul was
   ever at Colosse." [9]

   While, however, there is so much uncertainty as to the person by whom
   the Church of Colosse was planted, that uncertainty, it is to be
   noticed, does not by any means arise from any indication of comparative
   indifference on the part of the Apostle Paul to the welfare of the
   Colossian converts in the Epistle which he addresses to them. While a
   prisoner at Rome for the sake of the Gospel, he had heard with deep
   concern of the insidious attempts which had been made by certain false
   teachers to draw off the Colossian Christians from the doctrine in
   which they had been instructed. It is not certain what were the precise
   tenets, that were attempted to be disseminated among them. There seems
   to have been a strange blending of the doctrines of the Essenes with
   the subtleties of Platonism, and the asceticism of Oriental Philosophy.

   The general scope of the Epistle is briefly stated by Davenant as
   follows -- that the hope of man's salvation is placed entirely in
   Christ alone, and that consequently we must rest satisfied with faith
   in Christ, and live according to the rule laid down in the Gospel, to
   the rejection of Mosaic ceremonies and philosophical speculations. The
   attentive reader of the New Testament cannot fail to observe a striking
   similarity between the Epistle to the Colossians and that addressed to
   the Ephesians, not merely in their general structure, but also in the
   subjects treated of, and even in the order and connection in which they
   are introduced -- a closeness of resemblance which clearly indicates,
   not merely that the Epistles were written by the same person, and about
   the same time, but also that the Churches to whom they were addressed,
   were in many respects similarly situated.

   Among the expository treatises on the Epistle to the Colossians, there
   is, apart from that of Calvin, no one that better deserves, or will
   more amply repay attentive perusal, than that of Bishop Davenant, as a
   sound, judicious, and eminently practical exposition of a portion of
   the New Testament, in which the distinctive doctrines and principles of
   Christianity are so largely brought into view. It deserves also to be
   mentioned in connection with this, that Mr. Howe, in his funeral sermon
   on the death of his intimate friend, the Rev. Richard Adams of Oxford,
   afterwards of London, speaks with high commendation of his "judicious
   and dilucid expositions of the Epistles to the Philippians and the
   Colossians -- which was the part he bore in the supplement to that
   useful work -- the English Annotations on the Bible, by the Rev. Mr.
   Matthew Pool." [10]

   The First Epistle To The Thessalonians is generally believed to have
   been the first Epistle written by PAUL to any of the Churches of
   Christ. It appears to have been written towards the close of A.D. 52,
   about two years subsequently to the introduction of the Gospel into
   Thessalonica by the instrumentality of Paul and Silas. Thessalonica was
   a large and populous city, situated on the Thermean Bay. The city was
   originally called Thermæ, but came to receive the name of Thessalonica
   from Philip, King of Macedon, by whom it was rebuilt and enlarged, in
   memory of the victory which he there gained over the Thessalians. Its
   present name is Saloniki -- manifestly a corruption of Thessalonica. It
   contains a population of 70,000, and is a city of great commercial
   importance.

   In the account which Luke gives of the introduction of the Gospel into
   Thessalonica, mention is made of Paul's entering into a Synagogue of
   the Jews and "reasoning with them three Sabbath days out of the
   Scriptures." (Acts 17:2.) This was the means of converting to the
   Christian faith some of his Jewish hearers; but, as is manifest from
   Paul's First Epistle to the Thessalonians, the converts gained were
   chiefly from among the idolatrous Gentiles. Thessalonica "adored many
   gods, but principally Jupiter, as the father of Hercules, the alleged
   founder of its ancient royal family." [11] A violent tumult which had
   been raised against PAUL and SILAS by the unbelieving Jews constrained
   them to quit Thessalonica on a sudden, and escape to Berea, and
   afterwards to Athens; and the abrupt manner in which the Apostle's
   labors at Thessalonica were broken off, seems to have led him to feel
   the more solicitous as to the prosperity of the Gospel in that city,
   and to have given occasion for the Church of the Thessalonians being
   favored to receive the earliest of PAUL'S Epistles.

   The First Epistle to the Thessalonians concludes with a special
   direction that we do not find to be given in connection with any other
   of Paul's Epistles:

   "I charge you by the Lord, that this Epistle be read unto all the holy
   brethren."
   (1 Thessalonians 5:27.)

   The strict charge thus given as to the public reading of the Epistle is
   justly adduced by Paley, in his Horæ Paulinæ, as a most convincing
   evidence of the authenticity of the Epistle. "Either the Epistle was
   publicly read in the Church of Thessalonica during St. Paul's lifetime,
   or it was not. If it was, no publication could be more authentic, no
   species of notoriety more unquestionable, no method of preserving the
   integrity of the copy more secure. If it was not, the clause we produce
   would remain a standing condemnation of the forgery, and, one would
   suppose, an invincible impediment to its success."

   It is an interesting circumstance, that the first Epistle written by
   Paul to any Christian Church affords a most pleasing view of the fruits
   of the Gospel among the Christians to whom it is addressed; while it
   presents a most attractive picture of zeal and devotedness on the part
   of the writer. "If I wished," says Fuller of Kettering, "to be
   impressed with a pattern of a Christian minister, I would study the
   second chapter of this Epistle" (1st Thessalonians); "and if I wished
   to see a pattern of a Christian people, I know not where I could look
   better than to the Church of the Thessalonians." [12] The general
   design of the Epistle is to express the high satisfaction afforded to
   the mind of the writer by the favorable accounts which had been brought
   him by Timothy respecting the Christians at Thessalonica, as well as to
   encourage them to stedfast adherence to the truth amidst more than
   ordinary temptations to apostasy. "Imagine," says Benson, in his
   Preface to the Epistle, "the Great Apostle of the Gentiles to be full
   of a just resentment and generous indignation against his countrymen,
   the unbelieving Jews, who had lately treated him and them so
   maliciously; and at the same time having the most tender and parental
   care and affection for the young converts at Thessalonica, and you will
   have the very posture of his mind during the writing of this Epistle,
   for these two things appear everywhere throughout the Epistle."

   The Second Epistle To The Thessalonians appears to have been written a
   short time after PAUL'S former Epistle to that Church. The Apostle had
   learned, that some expressions in his former Epistle in reference to
   the hopes of Christians beyond the grave had been misapprehended by the
   Thessalonian converts, as though he had intended to intimate that
   Christ's second advent was near at hand. In correcting this mistaken
   idea, he takes occasion to predict a great apostasy that was to
   overspread to a large extent the Christian Church, and when we consider
   how directly opposed "The Mystery Of Iniquity" (2 Thessalonians 2:7)
   here predicted is to the nature of Christianity, and how unlikely the
   breaking out of such a system of error must have appeared at the time
   when the prediction was given forth, this portion of the Apostolical
   Writings must be regarded as affording unequivocal evidence of their
   Divine authority. It is not a little remarkable that the Apostle Paul,
   in one of the earliest of his Epistles, and when writing to a Church
   that was in a most flourishing condition, foretells with the utmost
   distinctness and minuteness, the rise and progress of a system of
   delusive error, which was not to be fully developed until several
   centuries subsequently to the time when the prediction was committed to
   writing; while it manifests itself even at the present day so
   strikingly in accordance with Paul's prediction, that no historian of
   recent times could have furnished a more accurate delineation of the
   appalling system in all its leading features, than was thus presented
   to the mind of Paul eighteen hundred years ago by the Spirit of
   Inspiration. This the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians, while it is
   the shortest of Paul's Epistles to the Churches, is invested with more
   than ordinary interest, as predicting the rise, progress, and final
   destinies of the Papal system.

   "The Epistle naturally divides itself," as is remarked by Dr. Adam
   Clarke, "into three parts, and each is contained in a separate chapter:

   "Part I., Chapter 1, contains the Address, and Motives of Consolation
   in their afflicted and persecuted state.

   "Part II., Chapter 2, is partly Prophetical, and partly Didactic. It
   contains the doctrine concerning Christ's Coming to Judgment, and a
   Prophecy concerning some future but great Apostasy from the Christian
   Faith.

   "Part III., Chapter 3., is wholly Hortatory, and contains a number of
   important Advices relative to Christian Virtues and a proper behavior
   in those situations in life in which it had pleased God to call them."

   The Reader will find prefixed to the present translation of Calvin's
   Commentary on the Colossians, a copy of the Translator's "Epistle
   Dedicatorie" to the old English translation of Calvin's Commentary on
   that Epistle, published in black letter in 1581. The Translator, who
   gives merely his initials, (R.V.,) appears to have been Robert Vahne,
   or Vaughan, who published also in 1581 a translation of Calvin's
   Commentary on the Galatians. The title-page is as follows: --"A
   Commentarie of M. Iohn Caluine, vpon the Epistle to the Colossians. And
   translated into English by R.V.

   Pray for the peace of Hierusalem, they shall prosper that loue thee.
   Psalm 122:6.

   At London, Printed by Thomas Purfoote, and are to be sold at his shop
   ouer against S. Sepulchers Church."

   He is also the author of "A Dialogue defensyue for women agaynst
   malicyous detractoures," published in 1542; and of a translation
   published in 1582, of "Examination of the Councell of Trent, touching
   the Decree of Traditions, by Mart. Kemnicious."

   It will be observed, that there is no separate Dedication by Calvin of
   his Commentaries on the Philippians and Colossians -- his Commentaries
   on these Epistles having been dedicated by him, along with those on
   Galatians and Ephesians, to Christopher, Duke of Wirtemberg. [2]The
   Dedication will be inserted in a future volume of The Calvin
   Translations, which will contain the Translation of the Commentaries on
   Galatians and Ephesians.

   Maturinus Corderius, (Mathurin Cordier,) to whom CALVIN dedicates his
   Commentary on the First Epistle to the Thessalonians, was, as stated by
   Beza, in his Life of Calvin, [13] "a man of great worth and erudition,
   and in the highest repute in almost all the schools of France as a
   teacher of youth." He taught at Paris, Nevers, Bordeaux, Neufchatel,
   Lausanne, and Geneva. He was the author of the "Colloquies," so much
   used in the education of youth throughout Europe. CALVIN was his pupil
   at the College de la Marche. He died at Geneva, where he taught till
   within a few days of his death, in 1564, at the age of eighty-five.

   Benedict Textor, to whom CALVIN dedicates his Commentary on the Second
   Epistle to the Thessalonians, appears to have been the son or nephew of
   Jean Tixier de Ravisi, or Ravisius Textor (Lord of Ravisi,) who was
   Rector of the University of Navarre at Paris, and was the author of
   various works. He died in 1524. There is a small volume still extant
   containing "Epistles" (to the number of 149,) which appears to have
   been written by a relative of Benedict Textor. It bears date 1602, and
   is entitled "Epistolæ Joannis Ravisii Textoris (Nivernensis) -- non
   vulgaris eruditionis."

   While The Commentaries of Calvin everywhere abound with important
   statements in reference to Popery, so that the reader will find able
   and successful refutations of the errors of that corrupt and delusive
   system brought forward in connection with the interpretation of
   passages of the Word of God, which might have seemed to have no
   particular bearing on the Papal system, and introduced by him for the
   most part with less abruptness than is to be observed in the writings
   of some of his contemporaries, the present Volume of his Commentaries
   is rendered the more interesting, and will, we trust, under the Divine
   blessing, be productive of the greater utility, in the present eventful
   times, from its containing Calvin's exposition of a portion of THE NEW
   TESTAMENT that presents the minutest and most comprehensive view that
   is to be found in any part of the Sacred Writings, of the rise,
   progress, and ultimate overthrow of Antichrist.

   THE ARGUMENT

   ON

   THE EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS

   It is generally known that PHILIPPI was a city of Macedonia, situated
   on the confines of Thrace, on the plains of which Pompey was conquered
   by Caesar; [14] and Brutus and Cassius were afterwards conquered by
   Antony and Octavius. [15] Thus Roman insurrections rendered this place
   illustrious by two memorable engagements. When PAUL was called into
   Macedonia by an express revelation, [16] he first founded a Church in
   that city, (as is related by LUKE in Acts 16:12,) which did not merely
   persevere steadfastly in the faith, but was also, in process of time,
   as this Epistle bears evidence, enlarged both in the number of
   individuals, and in their proficiency in respect of attainments.

   The occasion of Paul's writing to the Philippians was this, -- As they
   had sent to him by Epaphroditus, their pastor, such things as were
   needed by him when in prison, for sustaining life, and for other more
   than ordinary expenses, there can be no doubt that Epaphroditus
   explained to him at the same time the entire condition of the Church,
   and acted the part of an adviser in suggesting those things, respecting
   which they required to be admonished. It appears, however, that
   attempts had been made upon them by false apostles, [17] who wandered
   hither and thither, with the view of spreading corruptions of sound
   doctrine; but as they had remained steadfast in the truth, the Apostle
   commends their steadfastness. Keeping, however, in mind human frailty,
   and having, perhaps, been instructed by Epaphroditus that they required
   to be seasonably confirmed, lest they should in process of time fall
   away, he subjoins such admonitions as he knew to be suitable to them.

   And having, first of all, with the view of securing their confidence,
   declared the pious attachment of his mind towards them, he proceeds to
   treat of himself and of his bonds, lest they should feel dismayed on
   seeing him a prisoner, and in danger of his life. He shews them,
   accordingly, that the glory of the gospel is so far from being lessened
   by this means, that it is rather an argument in confirmation of its
   truth, and he at the same time stirs them up by his own example to be
   prepared for every event. [18] He at length concludes the First Chapter
   with a short exhortation to unity and patience.

   As, however, ambition is almost invariably the mother of dissensions,
   and comes, on this account, to open a door for new and strange
   doctrines, he, in the commencement of the Second Chapter, entreats
   them, with great earnestness, to hold nothing more highly in esteem
   than humility and modesty. With this view he makes use of various
   arguments. And that he may the better retain them, [19] he promises to
   send Timothy to them shortly, nay more, he expresses a hope of being
   able to visit them himself. He afterwards assigns a reason for delay on
   the part of Epaphroditus. [20]

   In the Third Chapter he inveighs against the false apostles, and sets
   aside both their empty boastings and the doctrine of circumcision,
   which they eagerly maintained. [21] To all their contrivances he
   opposes the simple doctrine of Christ. To their arrogance [22] he
   opposes his former life and present course of conduct, in which a true
   image of Christian piety shone forth. He shews, also, that the summit
   of perfection, at which we must aim during our whole life, is this --
   to have fellowship with Christ in his death and resurrection; and this
   he establishes by his own example.

   He begins the Fourth Chapter with particular admonitions, but proceeds
   afterwards to those of a general nature. He concludes the Epistle with
   a declaration of his gratitude to the PHILIPPIANS, that they may not
   think that what they had laid out for relieving his necessities had
   been ill bestowed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [14] Caesar's celebrated victory over Pompey took place on the plains
   of Pharsalia, in Thessaly, with which Philippi in Macedonia is
   sometimes confounded by the poets. (See Virg. G. I. 490, Juvenal,
   8:242.) Their being sometimes confounded with each other appears to
   have arisen from the circumstance that there was near Pharsalos, in
   Thessaly, a town named Philippi, the original name of which was Thebae,
   distinguished from Thebae in Boeotia by its being called Thebae
   Thessaliae, or Phthioticae, but having fallen under the power of
   Philip, King of Macedon, was in honor of the conqueror called Philippi,
   or Philippopolis. -- Ed.

   [15] The decisive engagement referred to was, as Dio Cassius observes,
   the most important of all that were fought during the civil wars, as it
   determined the fate of Roman liberty, so that the contest thenceforward
   was not for freedom, but -- what master the Romans should serve. From
   its having been fought on the plains of Philippi, it is called by
   Suetonius Philippense bellum, (the battle of Philippi,) Suet. Aug. 13;
   and by Pliny, Philippense praelium, (the engagement at Philippi.) --
   Ed.

   [16] "Vne vision enuoyee de Dieu;" -- "A vision sent from God."

   [17] "Auoyent essayer les esbranler;" -- "Had attempted to shake them."

   [18] "De s'apprestre a tout ce qu'il plaira a Dieu leur enuoyer;" --
   "To be prepared for everything that it shall please God to send upon
   them."

   [19] "Et pour leur donner courage, afin qu'ils ne se laissent cependant
   abuser;" -- "And with the view of encouraging them, that they may not
   allow themselves in the meantime to go astray."

   [20] "Il excuse Epaphrodite de ce qu'il auoit tant demeuré sans
   retourner vers eux;" -- "He excuses Epaphroditus for having remained so
   long, instead of returning to them."

   COMMENTARY ON

   THE EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS.

   CHAPTER 1
     __________________________________________________________________

   Philippians 1:1-6

   1. Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints
   in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:

   1. Paulus et Timotheus, servi Iesu Christi, omnibus sanctis in Christo
   Iesu, qui sunt Philippis, cum Episcopis et Diaconis

   2. Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord
   Jesus Christ.

   2. Gratia vobis et pax a Deo Patre nostro, et Domino Iesu Christo.

   3. I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,

   3. Gratias ago Deo meo in omni memoria vestri. [23]

   4. Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,

   4. Semper in omni precatione mea pro vobis omnibus cum gaudio
   precationem faciens,

   5. For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;

   5. Super communicatione vestra in Evangelium, a primo die hucusque;

   6. Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good
   work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.

   6. Hoc ipsum persuasus, quod qui coepit in vobis opus bonum, perficiet
   usque in diem Iesu Christi.


   1 Paul and Timotheus, servants of Jesus Christ While Paul is
   accustomed, in the inscription of his epistles, to employ titles of
   distinction, with the view of procuring credit for himself and his
   ministry, there was no need of lengthened commendations in writing to
   the Philippians, who had known him by experience as a true Apostle of
   Christ, and still acknowledged him as such beyond all controversy. For
   they had persevered in the calling of God steadfastly, and in an even
   tenor. [24]

   Bishops He names the pastors separately, for the sake of honor. We may,
   however, infer from this, that the name of bishop is common to all the
   ministers of the Word, inasmuch as he assigns several bishops to one
   Church. The titles, therefore, of bishop and pastor, are synonymous.
   And this is one of the passages which Jerome quotes for proving this in
   his epistle to Evagrius, [25] and in his exposition of the Epistle to
   Titus. [26] Afterwards [27] there crept in the custom of applying the
   name of bishop exclusively to the person whom the presbyters in each
   church appointed over their company. [28] It originated, however, in a
   human custom, and rests on no Scripture authority. I acknowledge,
   indeed, that, as the minds and manners of men are, there cannot be
   order maintained among the ministers of the word, without one presiding
   over the others. I speak of particular bodies, [29] not of whole
   provinces, much less of the whole world. Now, although we must not
   contend for words, it were at the same time better for us in speaking
   to follow the Holy Spirit, the author of tongues, than to change for
   the worse forms of speech which are dictated to us by Him. For from the
   corrupted signification of the word this evil has resulted, that, as if
   all the presbyters [30] were not colleagues, called to the same office,
   one of them, under the pretext of a new appellation, usurped dominion
   over the others.

   Deacons. This term may be taken in two ways -- either as meaning
   administrators, and curators of the poor, or for elders, who were
   appointed for the regulation of morals. As, however, it is more
   generally made use of by Paul in the former sense, I understand it
   rather as meaning stewards, who superintended the distributing and
   receiving of alms. On the other points consult the preceding
   commentaries.

   3 I give thanks. He begins with thanksgiving [31] on two accounts --
   first, that he may by this token shew his love to the Philippians; and
   secondly, that, by commending them as to the past, he may exhort them,
   also, to perseverance in time to come. He adduces, also, another
   evidence of his love -- the anxiety which he exercised in
   supplications. It is to be observed, however, that, whenever he makes
   mention of things that are joyful, he immediately breaks forth into
   thanksgiving -- a practice with which we ought also to be familiar. We
   must, also, take notice, what things they are for which he gives thanks
   to God, -- the fellowship of the Philippians in the gospel of Christ;
   for it follows from this, that it ought to be ascribed to the grace of
   God. When he says, upon every remembrance of you, he means, "As often
   as I remember you."

   4 Always in every prayer. Connect the words in this manner: "Always
   presenting prayer for you all in every prayer of mine." For as he had
   said before, that the remembrance of them was an occasion of joy to
   him, so he now subjoins, that they come into his mind as often as he
   prays. He afterwards adds, that it is with joy that he presents prayer
   in their behalf. Joy refers to the past; prayer to the future. For he
   rejoiced in their auspicious beginnings, and was desirous of their
   perfection. Thus it becomes us always to rejoice in the blessings
   received from God in such a manner, as to remember to ask from him
   those things that we are still in need of.

   5 For your fellowship. He now, passing over the other clause, states
   the ground of his joy -- that they had come into the fellowship of the
   gospel, that is, had become partakers of the gospel, which, as is well
   known, is accomplished by means of faith; for the gospel appears as
   nothing to us, in respect of any enjoyment of it, until we have
   received it by faith. At the same time the term fellowship may be
   viewed as referring to the common society of the saints, as though he
   had said that they had been associated with all the children of God in
   the faith of the gospel. When he says, from the first day, he commends
   their promptitude in having shewn themselves teachable immediately upon
   the doctrine being set before them. The phrase until now denotes their
   perseverance. Now we know how rare an excellence it is, to follow God
   immediately upon his calling us, and also to persevere steadfastly unto
   the end. For many are slow and backward to obey, while there are still
   more that fall short through fickleness and inconstancy. [32]

   6 Persuaded of this very thing. An additional ground of joy is
   furnished in his confidence in them for the time to come. [33] But some
   one will say, why should men dare to assure themselves for to-morrow
   amidst so great an infirmity of nature, amidst so many impediments,
   ruggednesses, and precipices? [34] Paul, assuredly, did not derive this
   confidence from the steadfastness or excellence of men, but simply from
   the fact, that God had manifested his love to the Philippians. And
   undoubtedly this is the true manner of acknowledging God's benefits --
   when we derive from them occasion of hoping well as to the future. [35]
   For as they are tokens at once of his goodness, and of his fatherly
   benevolence towards us, what ingratitude were it to derive from this no
   confirmation of hope and good courage! In addition to this, God is not
   like men, so as to be wearied out or exhausted by conferring kindness.
   [36] Let, therefore, believers exercise themselves in constant
   meditation upon the favors which God confers, that they may encourage
   and confirm hope as to the time to come, and always ponder in their
   mind this syllogism: God does not forsake the work which his own hands
   have begun, as the Prophet bears witness, (Psalm 138:8; Isaiah 64:8;)
   we are the work of his hands; therefore he will complete what he has
   begun in us. When I say that we are the work of his hands, I do not
   refer to mere creation, but to the calling by which we are adopted into
   the number of his sons. For it is a token to us of our election, that
   the Lord has called us effectually to himself by his Spirit.

   It is asked, however, whether any one can be certain as to the
   salvation of others, for Paul here is not speaking of himself but of
   the Philippians. I answer, that the assurance which an individual has
   respecting his own salvation, is very different from what he has as to
   that of another. For the Spirit of God is a witness to me of my
   calling, as he is to each of the elect. As to others, we have no
   testimony, except from the outward efficacy of the Spirit; that is, in
   so far as the grace of God shews itself in them, so that we come to
   know it. There is, therefore, a great difference, because the assurance
   of faith remains inwardly shut up, and does not extend itself to
   others. But wherever we see any such tokens of Divine election as can
   be perceived by us, we ought immediately to be stirred up to entertain
   good hope, both in order that we may not be envious [37] towards our
   neighbors, and withhold from them an equitable and kind judgment of
   charity; and also, that we may be grateful to God. [38] This, however,
   is a general rule both as to ourselves and as to others -- that,
   distrusting our own strength, we depend entirely upon God alone.

   Until the day of Jesus Christ The chief thing, indeed, to be understood
   here is -- until the termination of the conflict. Now the conflict is
   terminated by death. As, however, the Spirit is accustomed to speak in
   this manner in reference to the last coming of Christ, it were better
   to extend the advancement of the grace of Christ to the resurrection of
   the flesh. For although those who have been freed from the mortal body
   do no longer contend with the lusts of the flesh, and are, as the
   expression is, beyond the reach of a single dart, [39] yet there will
   be no absurdity in speaking of them as in the way of advancement, [40]
   inasmuch as they have not yet reached the point at which they aspire,
   -- they do not yet enjoy the felicity and glory which they have hoped
   for; and in fine, the day has not yet shone which is to discover the
   treasures which lie hid in hope. And in truth, when hope is treated of,
   our eyes must always be directed forward to a blessed resurrection, as
   the grand object in view.

   Philippians 1:7-11

   7. Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have
   you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and
   confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.

   7. Sicuti iustum est mihi hoc de vobis omnibus sentire, propterea quod
   in corde vos habeam, esse omnes participes gratiæ meæ, et in vinculis
   meis, et in defensione, et confirmatione Evangelii.

   of Jesus Christ.

   8. Testis enim mihi est Deus, ut desiderem vos omnes in visceribus [41]
   Iesu Christi.

   9. And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in
   knowledge and in all judgment;

   9. Et hoc precor, ut caritas vestra adhue magis ac magis abundet cum
   agnitione, omnique intelligentia:

   10. That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be
   sincere, and without offence till the day of Christ;

   10. Ut probetis quæ utilia sunt, qno sitis sinceri, et inoffensi usque
   in diem Christi.

   Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.

   11. Impleti fructibus iustitiae, qui sunt per Iesum Christum, in

   7 As it is reasonable. For we are envious [42] valuators of the gifts
   of God if we do not reckon as children of God those in whom there shine
   forth those true tokens of piety, which are the marks by which the
   Spirit of adoption manifests himself. Paul accordingly says, that
   equity itself dictates to him, [43] that he should hope well of the
   Philippians in all time to come, inasmuch as he sees them to be
   associated with himself in participation of grace. It is not without
   due consideration that I have given a different rendering of this
   passage from that of Erasmus, as the judicious reader will easily
   perceive. For he states what opinion he has of the Philippians, which
   was the ground of his hoping well respecting them. He says, then, that
   they are partakers with him of the same grace in his bonds, and in the
   defense of the gospel.

   To have them in his heart is to reckon them as such in the inmost
   affection of his heart. For the Philippians had always assisted Paul
   according to their ability, so as to connect themselves with him as
   associates for maintaining the cause of the gospel, so far as was in
   their power. Thus, although they were absent in body, yet, on account
   of the pious disposition which they shewed by every service in their
   power, he recognises them as in bonds along with him. "I have you,
   therefore, in my heart;" this is, sincerely and without any pretense,
   assuredly, and with no slight or doubtful opinion -- as what? as
   partakers of grace -- in what? in my bonds, by which the gospel is
   defended. As he acknowledged them to be such, it was reasonable that he
   should hope well respecting them.

   Of my grace and in the bonds. It were a ludicrous thing in the view of
   the world to reckon a prison to be a benefit from God, but if we
   estimate the matter aright, it is no common honor that God confers upon
   us, when we suffer persecution for the sake of his truth. For it was
   not in vain that it was said,

   Blessed shall ye be, when men shall afflict and harass you with all
   kinds of reproaches for my name's sake. (Matthew 5:11)

   Let us therefore bear in remembrance also, that we must with readiness
   and alacrity embrace the fellowship of the cross of Christ as a special
   favor from God. In addition to bonds he subjoins the defense and
   confirmation of the gospel, that he may express so much the better the
   honourableness of the service which God has enjoined upon us in placing
   us in opposition to his enemies, so as to bear testimony to his gospel.
   For it is as though he had entrusted us with the defense of his gospel.
   And truly it was when armed with this consideration, that the martyrs
   were prepared to contemn all the rage of the wicked, and to rise
   superior to every kind of torture. And would that this were present to
   the mind of all that are called to make a confession of their faith,
   that they have been chosen by Christ to be as advocates to plead his
   cause! For were they sustained by such consolation they would be more
   courageous than to be so easily turned aside into a perfidious revolt.
   [44]

   Here, however, some one will inquire, whether the confirmation of the
   gospel depends on the steadfastness of men. I answer, that the truth of
   God is in itself too firm to require that it should have support from
   any other quarter; for though we should all of us be found liars, God,
   nevertheless, remains true. (Romans 3:4.) There is, however, no
   absurdity in saying, that weak consciences are confirmed in it by such
   helps. That kind of confirmation, therefore, of which Paul makes
   mention, has a relation to men, as we learn from our own experience
   that the slaughter of so many martyrs has been attended at least with
   this advantage, that they have been as it were so many seals, by which
   the gospel has been sealed in our hearts. Hence that saying of
   Tertullian, that "the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church,"
   -- which I have imitated in a certain poem: "But that sacred blood,
   [45] the maintainer of God's honor, will be like seed for producing
   offspring." [46]

   8. For God is my witness. He now declares more explicitly his affection
   for them, and, with the view of giving proof of it, he makes use of an
   oath, and that on good grounds, because we know how dear in the sight
   of God is the edification of his Church. It was, too, more especially
   of advantage, that Paul's affection should be thoroughly made known to
   the Philippians. For it tends in no small degree to secure credit for
   the doctrine, when the people are persuaded that they are beloved by
   the teacher. He calls God as a witness to the truth, inasmuch as he
   alone is the Truth, and as a witness of his affection, inasmuch as he
   alone is the searcher of hearts. In the word rendered long after, a
   particular term is made use of instead of a general, and it is a token
   of affection, inasmuch as we long after those things which are dear to
   us.

   In the bowels He places the bowels of Christ in opposition to carnal
   affection, to intimate that his affection is holy and pious. For the
   man that loves according to the flesh has respect to his own advantage,
   and may from time to time change his mind according to the variety of
   circumstances and seasons. In the meantime he instructs us by what rule
   the affections of believers ought to be regulated, so that, renouncing
   their own will, they may allow Christ to sit at the helm. And,
   unquestionably, true love can flow from no other source than from the
   bowels of Christ, and this, like a goad, ought to affect us not a
   little -- that Christ in a manner opens his bowels, that by them he may
   cherish mutual affection between us. [47]

   9 This I pray that your love He returns to the prayer, which he had
   simply touched upon in one word in passing. He states, accordingly, the
   sum of those things which he asked from God in their behalf, that they
   also may learn to pray after his example, and may aspire at proficiency
   in those gifts. The view taken by some, as though the love of the
   Philippians denoted the Philippians themselves, as illiterate persons
   are accustomed very commonly to say, "Your reverence," -- "Your
   paternity," is absurd. For no instance of such an expression occurs in
   the writings of Paul, nor had such fooleries come into use. Besides,
   the statement would be less complete, and, independently of this, the
   simple and natural meaning of the words suits admirably well. For the
   true attainments of Christians are when they make progress in
   knowledge, and understanding, and afterwards in love. Accordingly the
   particle in, according to the idiom of the Hebrew tongue, is taken here
   to mean with, as I have also rendered it, unless perhaps one should
   prefer to explain it as meaning by, so as to denote the instrument or
   formal cause. For, the greater proficiency we make in knowledge, so
   much the more ought our love to increase. The meaning in that case
   would be, "That your love may increase according to the measure of
   knowledge." All knowledge, means what is full and complete -- not a
   knowledge of all things. [48]

   10 That ye may approve the things that are Here we have a definition of
   Christian wisdom -- to know what is advantageous or expedient -- not to
   torture the mind with empty subtleties and speculations. For the Lord
   does not wish that his believing people should employ themselves
   fruitlessly in learning what is of no profit: From this you may gather
   in what estimation the Sorbonnic theology ought to be held, in which
   you may spend your whole life, and yet not derive more of edification
   from it in connection with the hope of a heavenly life, or more of
   spiritual advantage, than from the demonstrations of Euclid.
   Unquestionably, although it taught nothing false, it well deserves to
   be execrable, on the ground that it is a pernicious profanation of
   spiritual doctrine. For Scripture is useful, as Paul says, in 2 Timothy
   3:16, but there you will find nothing but cold subtleties of words.

   That ye may be sincere. This is the advantage which we derive from
   knowledge -- not that every one may artfully consult his own interests,
   but that we may live in pure conscience in the sight of God.

   It is added -- and without offense The Greek word aproskopoi is
   ambiguous. Chrysostom explains it in an active sense -- that as he had
   desired that they should be pure and upright in the sight of God, so he
   now desires that they should lead an honorable life in the sight of
   men, that they may not injure their neighbors by any evil examples.
   This exposition I do not reject: the passive signification, however, is
   better suited to the context, in my opinion. For he desires wisdom for
   them, with this view -- that they may with unwavering step go forward
   in their calling until the day of Christ, as on the other hand it
   happens through ignorance, [49] that we frequently slip our foot,
   stumble, and turn aside. And how many stumbling blocks Satan from time
   to time throws in our way, with the view of either stopping our course
   altogether, or impeding it, every one of us knows from his own
   experience.

   11 Filled with the fruits of righteousness. This now belongs to the
   outward life, for a good conscience produces its fruits by means of
   works. Hence he desires that they may be fruitful in good works for the
   glory of God. Such fruits, he says, are by Christ, because they flow
   from the grace of Christ. For the beginning of our well-doing is, when
   we are sanctified by his Spirit, for he rested upon him, that we might
   all receive of his fullness. (John 1:16.) And as Paul here derives a
   similitude from trees, we are wild olive-trees, (Romans 11:24,) and
   unproductive, until we are ingrafted into Christ, who by his living
   root makes us fruitbearing trees, in accordance with that saying, (John
   15:1,) I am the vine, ye are the branches. He at the same time shews
   the end -- that we may promote the glory of God. For no life is so
   excellent in appearance as not to be corrupted and become offensive in
   the view of God, if it is not directed towards this object.

   Paul's speaking here of works under the term righteousness, is not at
   all inconsistent with the gratuitous righteousness of faith. For it
   does not immediately follow that there is righteousness wherever there
   are the fruits of righteousness, inasmuch as there is no righteousness
   in the sight of God, unless there be a full and complete obedience to
   the law, which is not found in any one of the saints, though,
   nevertheless, they bring forth, according to the measure, the good and
   pleasant [50] fruits of righteousness, and for this reason, that, as
   God begins righteousness in us, through the regeneration of the Spirit,
   so what is wanting is amply supplied through the remission of sins, in
   such a way that all righteousness, nevertheless, depends upon faith.

   Philippians 1:12-17

   12. But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which
   happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the
   gospel;

   12. Scire autem vos volo, fratres, quod, quae mihi acciderunt, magis in
   profectum cesserunt Evangelii,

   13. So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in
   all other places;

   13. Ut vincula mea in Christo illustria fuerint in toto praetorio, et
   reliquis omnibus locis:

   14. And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds,
   are much more bold to speak the word without fear.

   14. Et multi ex fratribus in Domino, vinculis meis confisi, uberius
   ausi fuerint absque timore sermonem Dei loqui.

   15. Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of
   good will:

   15. Nonnulli quidem per invidiam et contentionem, alii autem etiam per
   benevolentiam, Christum praedicant.

   16. The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to
   add affliction to my bonds:

   16. Alii, inquam, ex contentione Christum annuntiant, non pure,
   existimantes afflictionem se suscitare meis vinculis:

   17. But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the
   gospel.

   17. Alii autem ex caritate, scientes quod in defensionem Evangelii
   positus sim.


   12 But I wish you to know We all know from our own experience, how much
   the flesh is wont to be offended by the abasement of the cross. We
   allow, indeed, Christ crucified to be preached to us; but when he
   appears in connection with his cross, then, as though we were
   thunderstruck at the novelty of it, [51] we either avoid him or hold
   him in abhorrence, and that not merely in our own persons, but also in
   the persons of those who deliver to us the gospel. It may have happened
   to the Philippians, that they were in some degree discouraged in
   consequence of the persecution of their Apostle. We may also very
   readily believe, that those bad workmen [52] who eagerly watched every
   occasion, however small, of doing injury, did not refrain from
   triumphing over the calamity of this holy man, and by this means making
   his gospel contemptible. If, however, they were not successful in this
   attempt, they might very readily calumniate him by representing him as
   hated by the whole world; and at the same time leading the Philippians
   to dread, lest, by an unfortunate association with him, [53] they
   should needlessly incur great dislike among all; for such are the usual
   artifices of Satan. The Apostle provides against this danger, when he
   states that the gospel had been promoted by means of his bonds. The
   design, accordingly, of this detail is, to encourage the Philippians,
   that they may not feel deterred [54] by the persecution endured by him.

   13 So that my bonds He employs the expression -- in Christ, to mean, in
   the affairs, or in the cause of Christ, for he intimates that his bonds
   had become illustrious, so as to promote the honor of Christ. [55] The
   rendering given by some -- through Christ, seems forced. I have also
   employed the word illustria (illustrious) in preference to manifesta,
   (manifest,) -- as having ennobled the gospel by their fame. [56]
   "Satan, indeed, has attempted it, and the wicked have thought that it
   would turn out so, that the gospel would be destroyed; but God has
   frustrated both the attempts of the former and the expectations of the
   latter, [57] and that in two ways, for while the gospel was previously
   obscure and unknown, it has come to be well known, and not only so, but
   has even been rendered honorable in the Praetorium, no less than in the
   rest of the city." By the praetorium I understand the hall and palace
   of Nero, which Fabius [58] and writers of that age call Augustale, (the
   Augustal.) For as the name praetor was at first a general term, and
   denoted all magistrates who held the chief sway, (hence it came that
   the dictator was called the sovereign praetor, [59] ) it, consequently,
   became customary to employ the term praetorium in war to mean the tent,
   either of the consul, [60] or of the person who presided, [61] while in
   the city it denoted the palace of Caesar, [62] from the time that the
   Cesars took possession of the monarchy. [63] Independently of this, the
   bench of praetor is also called the praetorium [64]

   14 Many of the brethren. By this instance we are taught that the
   tortures of the saints, endured by them in behalf of the gospel, are a
   ground of confidence [65] to us. It were indeed a dreadful spectacle,
   and such as might tend rather to dishearten us, did we see nothing but
   the cruelty and rage of the persecutors. When, however, we see at the
   same time the hand of the Lord, which makes his people unconquerable,
   [66] under the infirmity of the Cross, and causes them to triumph,
   relying upon this, [67] we ought to venture farther than we had been
   accustomed, having now a pledge of our victory in the persons of our
   brethren. The knowledge of this ought to overcome our fears, that we
   may speak boldly in the midst of dangers.

   15 Some indeed. Here is another fruit of Paul's bonds, that not only
   were the brethren stirred up to confidence by his example -- some by
   maintaining their position, others by becoming more eager to teach --
   but even those who wished him evil were on another account stirred up
   to publish the gospel.

   16 Some, I say, from contention. Here we have a lengthened detail, in
   which he explains more fully the foregoing statement; for he repeats
   that there are two classes of men that are stirred up by his bonds to
   preach Christ -- the one influenced by contention, that is, by depraved
   affection -- the other by pious zeal, as being desirous to maintain
   along with him the defense of the gospel. The former, he says, do not
   preach Christ purely, because it was not a right zeal. [68] For the
   term does not apply to doctrine, because it is possible that the man
   who teaches most purely, may, nevertheless, not be of a sincere mind.
   [69] Now, that this impurity was in the mind, and did not shew itself
   in doctrine, may be inferred from the context. Paul assuredly would
   have felt no pleasure in seeing the gospel corrupted; yet he declares
   that he rejoices in the preaching of those persons, while it was not
   simple or sincere.

   It is asked, however, how such preaching could be injurious to him? I
   answer, that many occasions are unknown to us, inasmuch as we are not
   acquainted with the circumstances of the times. It is asked farther,
   "Since the gospel cannot be preached but by those that understand it,
   what motive induced those persons to persecute the doctrine of which
   they approved?" I answer, that ambition is blind, nay, it is a furious
   beast. Hence it is not to be wondered if false brethren snatch a weapon
   from the gospel for harassing good and pious pastors. [70] Paul,
   assuredly, says nothing here [71] of which I have not myself had
   experience. For there are living at this very day those who have
   preached the gospel with no other design, than that they might gratify
   the rage of the wicked by persecuting pious pastors. As to Paul's
   enemies, it is of importance to observe, if they were Jews, how mad
   their hatred was, so as even to forget on what account they hated him.
   For while they made it their aim to destroy him, they exerted
   themselves to promote the gospel, on account of which they were hostile
   to him; but they imagined, no doubt, that the cause of Christ would
   stand or fall [72] in the person of one individual. If, however, there
   were envious persons, [73] who were thus hurried away by ambition, we
   ought to acknowledge the wonderful goodness of God, who,
   notwithstanding, gave such a prosperous issue to their depraved
   affections.

   17 That for the defense. Those who truly loved Christ reckoned that it
   would be a disgrace to them if they did not associate themselves with
   Paul as his companions, when maintaining the cause of the gospel; and
   we must act in such a manner, as to give a helping hand, as far as
   possible, to the servants of Christ when in difficulty. [74] Observe,
   again, this expression -- for the defense of the gospel For since
   Christ confers upon us so great an honor, what excuse shall we have, if
   we shall be traitors to his cause, [75] or what may we expect, if we
   betray it by our silence, but that he shall in return desert our cause,
   who is our sole Advocate, or Patron, with the Father? [76] (1 John
   2:1.)

   Philippians 1:18-21

   18. What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in
   truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will
   rejoice.

   18. Quid enim? Caeterum quovis modo, sive per occasionem, sive per
   veritatem, Christus annuntiatur: atque in hoc gaudeo, quin etiam
   gaudebo.

   19. For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your
   prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,

   19. Novi enim quod hoc mihi cedet in salutem per vestram precationem,
   et subministrationem Spiritus Iesu Christi,

   20. According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I
   shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also
   Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by
   death.

   20. Secundum expectationem et spem meam, quod in nullo re pudefiam, sed
   cum omni fiducia, quemadmodum semper, ita et nunc magnificabitur
   Christus in corpore meo, sive per vitam, sive per mortem.

   21. For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.

   21. Mihi enim vivendo Christus est, et moriendo lucrum.


   18 But in every way. As the wicked disposition of those of whom he has
   spoken might detract from the acceptableness of the doctrine, [77] he
   says that this ought to be reckoned of great importance, that they
   nevertheless promoted the cause of the gospel, whatever their
   disposition might be. For God sometimes accomplishes an admirable work
   by means of wicked and depraved instruments. Accordingly, he says that
   he rejoices in a happy result of this nature; because this one thing
   contented him -- if he saw the kingdom of Christ increasing -- just as
   we, on hearing that that impure dog Carolus [78] was scattering the
   seeds of pure doctrine at Avignon and elsewhere, we gave thanks to God
   because he had made use of that most profligate and worthless villain
   for his glory: and at this day we rejoice that the progress of the
   gospel is advanced by many who, nevertheless, had another design in
   view. But though Paul rejoiced in the advancement of the gospel, yet,
   had the matter been in his hand, he would never have ordained such
   persons as ministers. We ought, therefore, to rejoice if God
   accomplishes anything that is good by means of wicked persons; but they
   ought not on that account to be either placed by us in the ministry, or
   looked upon as Christ's lawful ministers.

   19 For I know that As some published the gospel with the view of
   rendering Paul odious, in order that they might kindle up against him
   the more the rage of his enemies, he tells them beforehand that their
   wicked attempts will do him no harm, because the Lord will turn them to
   a contrary design. "Though they plot my destruction, yet I trust that
   all their attempts will have no other effect but that Christ will be
   glorified in me -- which is a thing most salutary to me." For it is
   evident from what follows, that he is not speaking of the safety of the
   body. But whence this confidence on the part of Paul? It is from what
   he teaches elsewhere, (Romans 8:28,) -- that all things contribute to
   the advantage of God's true worshippers, even though the whole world,
   with the devil, its prince, should conspire together for their ruin.

   Through your prayer That he may stir them up to pray more ardently, he
   declares that he is confident that the Lord will give them an answer to
   their prayers. Nor does he use dissimulation: for he who depends for
   help on the prayers of the saints relies on the promise of God. In the
   mean time, nothing is detracted from the unmerited goodness of God, on
   which depend our prayers, and what is obtained by means of them.

   And the supply. Let us not suppose, that because he joins these two
   things in one connection, they are consequently alike. The statement
   must, therefore, be explained in this manner: -- "I know that all this
   will turn out to my advantage, through the administration of the
   Spirit, you also helping by prayer," -- so that the supply of the
   Spirit is the efficient cause, while prayer is a subordinate help. We
   must also observe the propriety of the Greek term, for epichoregia is
   employed to mean the furnishing of what is wanting, [79] just as the
   Spirit of God pours into us everything of which we are destitute.

   He calls him, too, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, to intimate, that if we
   are Christians, he is common to all of us, inasmuch as he was poured
   upon him with all fullness, that, according to the measure of his
   grace, he might give out, so far as is expedient, to each of his
   members.

   20 According to my expectation. Should any one object, "From what do
   you derive that knowledge?" he answers, "From hope." For as it is
   certain that God does not by any means design to frustrate our hope,
   hope itself ought not to be wavering. Let then the pious reader
   carefully observe this adverb secundum, (according to,) that he may be
   fully assured in his own mind, that it is impossible but that the Lord
   will fulfill our expectation, inasmuch as it is founded on his own
   word. Now, he has promised that he will never be wanting to us even in
   the midst of all tortures, if we are at any time called to make
   confession of his name. Let, therefore, all the pious entertain hope
   after Paul's example, and they will not be put to shame.

   With all confidence We see that, in cherishing hope, he does not give
   indulgence to carnal desires, but places his hope in subjection to the
   promise of God. "Christ," says he, "will be magnified in my body,
   whether by life or by death " By making express mention, however, of
   the body, he intimates that, amongst the conflicts of the present life,
   he is in no degree doubtful as to the issue, for we are assured as to
   this by God. If, accordingly, giving ourselves up to the good pleasure
   of God, and having in our life the same object in view as Paul had, we
   expect, in whatever way it may be, a prosperous issue, we shall no
   longer have occasion to fear lest any adversity should befall us; for
   if we live and die to him, we are his in life and in death. (Romans
   14:8.) He expresses the way in which Christ will be magnified -- by
   full assurance. Hence it follows, that through our fault he is cast
   down and lowered, so far as it is in our power to do so, when we give
   way through fear. Do not those then feel ashamed who reckon it a light
   offense to tremble, [80] when called to make confession of the truth?
   But how much ashamed ought those to feel, who are so shamelessly
   impudent as to have the hardihood even to excuse renunciation?

   He adds, as always, that they may confirm their faith from past
   experience of the grace of God. Thus, in Romans 5:4, he says,
   Experience begets hope.

   21 For to me to live. Interpreters have hitherto, in my opinion, given
   a wrong rendering and exposition to this passage; for they make this
   distinction, that Christ was life to Paul, and death was gain. I, on
   the other hand, make Christ the subject of discourse in both clauses,
   so that he is declared to be gain in him both in life and in death; for
   it is customary with the Greeks to leave the word pros to be
   understood. Besides that this meaning is less forced, it also
   corresponds better with the foregoing statement, and contains more
   complete doctrine. He declares that it is indifferent to him, and is
   all one, whether he lives or dies, because, having Christ, he reckons
   both to be gain. And assuredly it is Christ alone that makes us happy
   both in death and in life; otherwise, if death is miserable, life is in
   no degree happier; so that it is difficult to determine whether it is
   more advantageous to live or to die out of Christ. On the other hand,
   let Christ be with us, and he will bless our life as well as our death,
   so that both will be happy and desirable for us.

   Philippians 1:22-26

   22. But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet
   what I shall choose I wot not.

   22. Quodsi vivere in carne operae pretium mihi est, etiam quid eligam
   ignoro. [81]

   23. For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to
   be with Christ; which is far better:

   23. Coarctor enim ex duobus cupiens dissolvi et esse cum Christo: multo
   enim hoc melius.

   24. Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.

   24. Manere vero in carne, magis necessarium propter vos.

   25. And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue
   with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;

   25. Atque hoc confisus novi, quod manebo et permanebo cum omnibus
   vobis, in vestrum profectum et gaudium fidei,

   26. That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by
   my coming to you again.

   26. Ut gloriatio vestra exsuperet in Christo Iesu de me, per meum
   rursus adventum ad vos.


   22 But if to live in the flesh. As persons in despair feel in
   perplexity as to whether they ought to prolong their life any farther
   in miseries, or to terminate their troubles by death, so Paul, on the
   other hand, says that he is, in a spirit of contentment, so well
   prepared for death or for life, because the condition of believers,
   both in the one case and in the other, is blessed, so that he is at a
   loss which to choose. If it is worth while; that is, "If I have reason
   to believe that there will be greater advantage from my life than from
   my death, I do not see which of them I ought to prefer." To live in the
   flesh, is an expression which he has made use of in contempt, from
   comparing it with a better life.

   23 For I am in a strait Paul did not desire to live with any other
   object in view than that of promoting the glory of Christ, and doing
   good to the brethren. Hence he does not reckon that he has any other
   advantage from living than the welfare of the brethren. But so far as
   concerns himself personally, it were, he acknowledges, better for him
   to die soon, because he would be with Christ. By his choice, however,
   he shews what ardent love glowed in his breast. There is nothing said
   here as to earthly advantages, but as to spiritual benefit, which is on
   good grounds supremely desirable in the view of the pious. Paul,
   however, as if forgetful of himself, does not merely hold himself
   undetermined, lest he should be swayed by a regard to his own benefit
   rather than that of the Philippians, but at length concludes that a
   regard to them preponderates in his mind. And assuredly this is in
   reality to live and die to Christ, when, with indifference as to
   ourselves, we allow ourselves to be carried and borne away withersoever
   Christ calls us.

   Having a desire to be set free and to be with Christ These two things
   must be read in connection. For death of itself will never be desired,
   because such a desire is at variance with natural feeling, but is
   desired for some particular reason, or with a view to some other end.
   Persons in despair have recourse to it from having become weary of
   life; believers, on the other hand, willingly hasten forward to it,
   because it is a deliverance from the bondage of sin, and an
   introduction into the kingdom of heaven. What Paul now says is this; "I
   desire to die, because I will, by this means, come into immediate
   connection with Christ." In the mean time, believers do not cease to
   regard death with horror, but when they turn their eyes to that life
   which follows death, they easily overcome all dread by means of that
   consolation. Unquestionably, every one that believes in Christ ought to
   be so courageous as to lift up his head on mention being made of death,
   delighted to have intimation of his redemption. (Luke 21:28.) From this
   we see how many are Christians only in name, since the greater part, on
   hearing mention made of death, are not merely alarmed, but are rendered
   almost lifeless through fear, as though they had never heard a single
   word respecting Christ. O the worth and value of a good conscience! Now
   faith is the foundation of a good conscience; nay more, it is itself
   goodness of conscience.

   To be set free This form of expression is to be observed. Profane
   persons speak of death as the destruction of man, as if he altogether
   perished. Paul here reminds us, that death is the separation of the
   soul from the body. And this he expresses more fully immediately
   afterwards, explaining as to what condition awaits believers after
   death -- that of dwelling with Christ We are with Christ even in this
   life, inasmuch as the kingdom of God is within us, (Luke 17:21,) and
   Christ dwells in us by faith, (Ephesians 3:17,) and has promised that
   he will be with us even unto the end of the world, (Matthew 28:20,) but
   that presence we enjoy only in hope. Hence as to our feeling, we are
   said to be at present at a distance from him. See 2 Corinthians 5:6.
   This passage is of use for setting aside the mad fancy of those who
   dream that souls sleep when separated from the body, for Paul openly
   declares that we enjoy Christ's presence on being set free from the
   body.

   25 And having this confidence. Some, reckoning it an inconsistent thing
   that the Apostle [82] should acknowledge himself to have been
   disappointed of his expectation, are of opinion that he was afterwards
   freed from bonds, and went over many countries of the world. Their
   fears, however, as to this are groundless, for the saints are
   accustomed to regulate their expectations according to the word of God,
   so as not to promise themselves more than God has promised. Thus, when
   they have a sure token of God's will, they in that case place their
   reliance also upon a sure persuasion, which admits of no hesitation. Of
   this nature is a persuasion respecting a perpetual remission of sins,
   respecting the aid of the Spirit for the grace of final perseverance,
   (as it is called,) and respecting the resurrection of the flesh. Of
   this nature, also, was the assurance of the Prophets respecting their
   prophecies. As to other things, they expect nothing except
   conditionally, and hence they subject all events to the providence of
   God, who, they allow, sees more distinctly than they. To remain, means
   here, to stay for a little while: to continue, means, to remain for a
   long time.

   26 That your glorying. The expression which he employs, en emoi, I have
   rendered de me (as to me,) because the preposition is made use of
   twice, but in different senses. No one assuredly will deny that I have
   faithfully brought out Paul's mind. The rendering given by some -- per
   Christum, (through Christ,) I do not approve of. For in Christ is
   employed in place of Secundum Christum, (According to Christ,) or
   Christiane, (Christianly,) to intimate that it was a holy kind of
   glorying. For otherwise we are commanded to glory in God alone. (1
   Corinthians 1:31.) Hence malevolent persons might meet Paul with the
   objection, How is it allowable for the Philippians to glory as to thee?
   He anticipates this calumny by saying that they will do this according
   to Christ -- glorying in a servant of Christ, with a view to the glory
   of his Lord, and that with an eye to the doctrine rather than to the
   individual, and in opposition to the false apostles, just as David, by
   comparing himself with hypocrites, boasts of his righteousness. (Psalm
   7:8.)

   Philippians 1:27-30

   27. Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ:
   that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your
   affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving
   together for the faith of the gospel;

   27. Tantum digne Evangelio Christi conversamini: ut sive veniens videam
   vos, sive absens, audiam de vobis, quod stetis in uno spiritu, una
   anima, concertantes fide Evangelii.

   28. And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an
   evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.

   28. Nec ulla in re terreamini ab adversariis, quae illis est
   demonstratio exitii: vobis autem salutis, idque a Deo.

   29. For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to
   believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;

   29. Quia vobis donatum est pro Christo, non tantum ut in illum
   credatis, sed etiam ut pro ipso patiamini:

   30. Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in
   me.

   30. Idem habentes certamen, quale vidistis in me, et nunc auditis de
   me.


   27 Only in a manner worthy of the gospel. We make use of this form of
   expression, when we are inclined to pass on to a new subject. Thus it
   is as though he had said, "But as for me, the Lord will provide, but as
   for you, etc., whatever may take place as to me, let it be your care,
   nevertheless, to go forward in the right course." When he speaks of a
   pure and honorable conversation as being worthy of the gospel, he
   intimates, on the other hand, that those who live otherwise do
   injustice to the gospel.

   That whether I come As the Greek phrase made use of by Paul is
   elliptical, I have made use of videam, (I see,) instead of videns
   (seeing.) If this does not appear satisfactory, you may supply the
   principal verb Intelligam, (I may learn,) in this sense: "Whether, when
   I shall come and see you, or whether I shall, when absent, hear
   respecting your condition, I may learn in both ways, both by being
   present and by receiving intelligence, that ye stand in one spirit." We
   need not, however, feel anxiety as to particular terms, when the
   meaning is evident.

   Stand in one spirit This, certainly, is one of the main excellences of
   the Church, and hence this is one means of preserving it in a sound
   state, inasmuch as it is torn to pieces by dissensions. But although
   Paul was desirous by means of this antidote to provide against novel
   and strange doctrines, yet he requires a twofold unity -- of spirit and
   soul. The first is, that we have like views; the second, that we be
   united in heart. For when these two terms are connected together,
   spiritus (spirit) denotes the understanding, while anima (soul) denotes
   the will. Farther, agreement of views comes first in order; and then
   from it springs union of inclination.

   Striving together for the faith This is the strongest bond of concord,
   when we have to fight together under the same banner, for this has
   often been the occasion of reconciling even the greatest enemies.
   Hence, in order that he may confirm the more the unity that existed
   among the Philippians, he calls them to notice that they are
   fellow-soldiers, who, having a common enemy and a common warfare, ought
   to have their minds united together in a holy agreement. The expression
   which Paul has made use of in the Greek (sunathlountes tho pistei) is
   ambiguous. The old interpreter renders it Collaborantes fidei,
   (laboring together with the faith.) [83] Erasmus renders it Adiuvantes
   fidem, (Helping the faith,) as if meaning, that they gave help to the
   faith to the utmost of their power. As, however, the dative in Greek is
   made use of instead of the ablative of instrumentality, (that language
   having no ablative,) I have no doubt that the Apostle's meaning is
   this: "Let the faith of the gospel unite you together, more especially
   as that is a common armory against one and the same enemy." In this way
   the particle sun, which others refer to faith, I take as referring to
   the Philippians, and with greater propriety, if I am not mistaken. In
   the first place, every one is aware how effectual an inducement it is
   to concord, when we have to maintain a conflict together; and farther,
   we know that in the spiritual warfare we are armed with the shield of
   faith, (Ephesians 6:16,) for repelling the enemy; nay, more, faith is
   both our panoply and our victory. Hence he added this clause, that he
   might shew what is the end of a pious connection. The wicked, too,
   conspire together for evil, but their agreement is accursed: let us,
   therefore, contend with one mind under the banner of faith.

   28 And in nothing terrified. The second thing which he recommends to
   the Philippians is fortitude of mind, [84] that they may not be thrown
   into confusion by the rage of their adversaries. At that time the most
   cruel persecutions raged almost everywhere, because Satan strove with
   all his might to impede the commencement of the gospel, and was the
   more enraged in proportion as Christ put forth powerfully the grace of
   his Spirit. He exhorts, therefore, the Philippians to stand forward
   undaunted, and not be thrown into alarm.

   Which is to them a manifest proof. This is the proper meaning of the
   Greek word, and there was no consideration that made it necessary for
   others to render it cause. For the wicked, when they wage war against
   the Lord, do already by a trial-fight, as it were, give a token of
   their ruin, and the more fiercely they insult over the pious, the more
   do they prepare themselves for ruin. The Scripture, assuredly, nowhere
   teaches, that the afflictions which the saints endure from the wicked
   are the cause of their salvation, but Paul in another instance, too,
   speaks of them as a manifest token or proof, (2 Thessalonians 1:5,) and
   instead of endeixin, which we have here, he in that passage makes use
   of the term endeigma [85] This, therefore, is a choice consolation,
   that when we are assailed and harassed by our enemies, we have an
   evidence of our salvation. [86] For persecutions are in a manner seals
   of adoption to the children of God, if they endure them with fortitude
   and patience: the wicked give a token of their condemnation, because
   they stumble against a stone by which they shall be bruised to pieces.
   (Matthew 21:44.)

   And that from God. This is restricted to the last clause, that a taste
   of the grace of God may allay the bitterness of the cross. No one will
   naturally perceive the cross a token or evidence of salvation, for they
   are things that are contrary in appearance. Hence Paul calls the
   attention of the Philippians to another consideration -- that God by
   his blessing turns into an occasion of welfare things that might
   otherwise seem to render us miserable. He proves it from this, that the
   endurance of the cross is the gift of God. Now it is certain, that all
   the gifts of God are salutary to us. To you, says he, it is given, not
   only to believe in Christ, but also to suffer for him. Hence even the
   sufferings themselves are evidences of the grace of God; and, since it
   is so, you have from this source a token of salvation. Oh, if this
   persuasion were effectually inwrought in our minds -- that persecutions
   [87] are to be reckoned among God's benefits, what progress would be
   made in the doctrine of piety! [88] And yet, what is more certain, than
   that it is the highest honor that is conferred upon us by Divine grace,
   that we suffer for his name either reproach, or imprisonment, or
   miseries, or tortures, or even death, for in that case he adorns us
   with his marks of distinction. [89] But more will be found that will
   rather bid God retire with gifts of that nature, than embrace with
   alacrity the cross when it is presented to them. Alas, then, for our
   stupidity! [90]

   29. To believe. He wisely conjoins faith with the cross by an
   inseparable connection, that the Philippians may know that they have
   been called to the faith of Christ on this condition -- that they
   endure persecutions on his account, as though he had said that their
   adoption can no more be separated from the cross, than Christ can be
   torn asunder from himself. Here Paul clearly testifies, that faith, as
   well as constancy in enduring persecutions, [91] is an unmerited gift
   of God. And certainly the knowledge of God is a wisdom that is too high
   for our attaining it by our own acuteness, and our weakness shews
   itself in daily instances in our own experience, when God withdraws his
   hand for a little while. That he may intimate the more distinctly that
   both are unmerited, he says expressly -- for Christ's sake, or at least
   that they are given to us on the ground of Christ's grace; by which he
   excludes every idea of merit.

   This passage is also at variance with the doctrine of the schoolmen, in
   maintaining that gifts of grace latterly conferred are rewards of our
   merit, on the ground of our having made a right use of those which had
   been previously bestowed. I do not deny, indeed, that God rewards the
   right use of his gifts of grace by bestowing grace more largely upon
   us, provided only you do not place merit, as they do, in opposition to
   his unmerited liberality and the merit of Christ.

   30 Having the same conflict. He confirms, also, by his own example what
   he had said, and this adds no little authority to his doctrine. By the
   same means, too, he shews them, that there is no reason why they should
   feel troubled on account of his bonds, when they behold the issue of
   the conflict.

   CHAPTER 2
     __________________________________________________________________

   Philippians 2:1-4

   1. If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of
   love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,

   1. Si qua igitur consolatio (vel, exhortatio) in Christo, si quod
   solatium dilectionis, si qua communicatio Spiritus, si qua viscera et
   misericordiae. [92]

   2. Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being
   of one accord, of one mind.

   2. Implete gaudium meum ut idem sentiatis, eandem habentes caritatem,
   unanimes, unum sentientes.

   3 Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of
   mind let each esteem other better than themselves.

   3. Nihil per contentionem, aut inanem gloriam, sed per humilitatem alii
   alios existiment se ipsis excellentiores.

   4. Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the
   things of others.

   4. Non considerans quisque quod suum est, sed quisque quod est aliorum.


   1 If there is therefore any consolation. There is an extraordinary
   tenderness in this exhortation, [93] in which he entreats by all means
   the Philippians mutually to cherish harmony among themselves, lest, in
   the event of their being torn asunder by intestine contentions, they
   should expose themselves to the impostures of the false apostles. For
   when there are disagreements, there is invariably a door opened for
   Satan to disseminate impious doctrines, while agreement is the best
   bulwark for repelling them.

   As the term parakleseos is often taken to mean exhortation, the
   commencement of the passage might be explained in this manner: "If an
   exhortation which is delivered in the name and by the authority of
   Christ, has any weight with you." The other meaning, however,
   corresponds better with the context: "If there is among you any
   consolation of Christ," by means of which you may alleviate my griefs,
   and if you would afford me any consolation and relief, which you
   assuredly owe me in the exercise of love; if you take into view that
   fellowship of the Spirit, which ought to make us all one; if any
   feeling of humanity and mercy resides in you, which might stir you up
   to alleviate my miseries, fulfill ye my joy, etc. From this we may
   infer, how great a blessing unity in the Church is, and with what
   eagerness pastors should endeavor to secure it. [94] We must also at
   the same time take notice, how he humbles himself by beseechingly
   imploring their pity, while he might have availed himself of his
   paternal authority, so as to demand respect from them as his sons. [95]
   He knew how to exercise authority when it was necessary, but at present
   he prefers to use entreaties, because he knew that these would be
   better fitted to gain an entrance into their affections, [96] and
   because he was aware that he had to do with persons who were docile and
   compliant. In this manner the pastor must have no hesitation to assume
   different aspects for the sake of the Church. [97]

   2 Fulfil ye my joy. Here again we may see how little anxiety he had as
   to himself, provided only it went well with the Church of Christ. He
   was kept shut up in prison, and bound with chains; he was reckoned
   worthy of capital punishment -- before his view were tortures -- near
   at hand was the executioner; yet all these things do not prevent his
   experiencing unmingled joy, provided he sees that the Churches are in a
   good condition. Now what he reckons the chief indication of a
   prosperous condition of the Church is -- when mutual agreement prevails
   in it, and brotherly harmony. Thus the 137th Psalm teaches us in like
   manner, that our crowning joy is the remembrance of Jerusalem. (Psalm
   137:6.) But if this were the completion of Paul's joy, the Philippians
   would have been worse than cruel if they had tortured the mind of this
   holy man with a twofold anguish by disagreement among themselves.

   That ye think the same thing. The sum is this -- that they be joined
   together in views and inclinations. For he makes mention of agreement
   in doctrine and mutual love; and afterwards, repeating the same thing,
   (in my opinion,) he exhorts them to be of one mind, and to have the
   same views. The expression to auto, (the same thing,) implies that they
   must accommodate themselves to each other. Hence the beginning of love
   is harmony of views, but that is not sufficient, unless men's hearts
   are at the same time joined together in mutual affection. At the same
   time there were no inconsistency in rendering it thus: -- "that ye may
   be of the same mind -- so as to have mutual love, to be one in mind and
   one in views;" for participles are not unfrequently made use of instead
   of infinitives. I have adopted, however, the view which seemed to me
   less forced.

   3 Nothing through strife or vain-glory. These are two most dangerous
   pests for disturbing the peace of the Church. Strife is awakened when
   every one is prepared to maintain pertinaciously his own opinion; and
   when it has once begun to rage it rushes headlong [98] in the direction
   from which it has entered. Vain-glory [99] tickles men's minds, so that
   every one is delighted with his own inventions. Hence the only way of
   guarding against dissensions is -- when we avoid strifes by
   deliberating and acting peacefully, especially if we are not actuated
   by ambition. For ambition is a means of fanning all strifes. [100]
   Vain-glory means any glorying in the flesh; for what ground of glorying
   have men in themselves that is not vanity?

   But by humility. For both diseases he brings forward one remedy --
   humility, and with good reason, for it is the mother of moderation, the
   effect of which is that, yielding up our own right, we give the
   preference to others, and are not easily thrown into agitation. He
   gives a definition of true humility -- when every one esteems himself
   less than others. Now, if anything in our whole life is difficult, this
   above everything else is so. Hence it is not to be wondered if humility
   is so rare a virtue. For, as one says, [101] "Every one has in himself
   the mind of a king, by claiming everything for himself." See! here is
   pride. Afterwards from a foolish admiration of ourselves arises
   contempt of the brethren. And so far are we from what Paul here
   enjoins, that one can hardly endure that others should be on a level
   with him, for there is no one that is not eager to have superiority.

   But it is asked, how it is possible that one who is in reality
   distinguished above others can reckon those to be superior to him who
   he knows are greatly beneath him? I answer, that this altogether
   depends on a right estimate of God's gifts, and our own infirmities.
   For however any one may be distinguished by illustrious endowments, he
   ought to consider with himself that they have not been conferred upon
   him that he might be self-complacent, that he might exalt himself, or
   even that he might hold himself in esteem. Let him, instead of this,
   employ himself in correcting and detecting his faults, and he will have
   abundant occasion for humility. In others, on the other hand, he will
   regard with honor whatever there is of excellences, and will by means
   of love bury their faults. The man who will observe this rule, will
   feel no difficulty in preferring others before himself. And this, too,
   Paul meant when he added, that they ought not to have every one a
   regard to themselves, but to their neighbors, or that they ought not to
   be devoted to themselves. Hence it is quite possible that a pious man,
   even though he should be aware that he is superior, may nevertheless
   hold others in greater esteem.

   Philippians 2:5-11

   5. Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:

   5. Hoc enim sentiatur in vobis quod et in Christo Iesu:

   6. Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal
   with God:

   6. Qui quum in forma Dei esset, non rapinam arbitratus esset, Deo
   aequalem se esse:

   7. But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a
   servant, and was made in the likeness of men:

   7. Sed se ipsum exinanivit, forma servi accepta, in similitudine
   hominum constitutus, et forma repertus ut homo.

   8. And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became
   obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.

   8. Humiliavit, inquam, se ipsum, factus obediens usque ad mortem,
   mortem vero crucis.

   9. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name
   which is above every name:

   9. Quamobrem et Deus illum superexaltavit, et dedit illi nomen quod
   esset super omne nomen,

   10. That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in
   heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;

   10. Ut in nomine Iesu omne genu flectatur, cælestium, terrestrium, et
   infernorum,

   11. And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to
   the glory of God the Father.

   11. Et omnis lingua confiteatur, quod Dominus Iesus in gloriam est Dei
   Patris.


   5. He now recommends, from the example of Christ, the exercise of
   humility, to which he had exhorted them in words. There are, however,
   two departments, in the first of which he invites us to imitate Christ,
   because this is the rule of life: [102] in the second, he allures us to
   it, because this is the road by which we attain true glory. Hence he
   exhorts every one to have the same disposition that was in Christ. He
   afterwards shews what a pattern of humility has been presented before
   us in Christ. I have retained the passive form of the verb, though I do
   not disapprove of the rendering given it by others, because there is no
   difference as to meaning. I merely wished that the reader should be in
   possession of the very form of expression which Paul has employed.

   6 Inasmuch as he was in the form of God. This is not a comparison
   between things similar, but in the way of greater and less. Christ's
   humility consisted in his abasing himself from the highest pinnacle of
   glory to the lowest ignominy: our humility consists in refraining from
   exalting ourselves by a false estimation. He gave up his right: all
   that is required of us is, that we do not assume to ourselves more than
   we ought. Hence he sets out with this -- that, inasmuch as he was in
   the form of God, he reckoned it not an unlawful thing for him to shew
   himself in that form; yet he emptied himself. Since, then, the Son of
   God descended from so great a height, how unreasonable that we, who are
   nothing, should be lifted up with pride!

   The form of God means here his majesty. For as a man is known by the
   appearance of his form, so the majesty, which shines forth in God, is
   his figure. [103] Or if you would prefer a more apt similitude, the
   form of a king is his equipage and magnificence, shewing him to be a
   king -- his scepter, his crown, his mantle, [104] his attendants, [105]
   his judgment-throne, and other emblems of royalty; the form of a consul
   was -- his long robe, bordered with purple, his ivory seat, his lictors
   with rods and hatchets. Christ, then, before the creation of the world,
   was in the form of God, because from the beginning he had his glory
   with the Father, as he says in John 17:5. For in the wisdom of God,
   prior to his assuming our flesh, there was nothing mean or
   contemptible, but on the contrary a magnificence worth of God. Being
   such as he was, he could, without doing wrong to any one, shew himself
   equal with God; but he did not manifest himself to be what he really
   was, nor did he openly assume in the view of men what belonged to him
   by right.

   Thought it not robbery. There would have been no wrong done though he
   had shewn himself to be equal with God. For when he says, he would not
   have thought, it is as though he had said, "He knew, indeed, that this
   was lawful and right for him," that we might know that his abasement
   was voluntary, not of necessity. Hitherto it has been rendered in the
   indicative -- he thought, but the connection requires the subjunctive.
   It is also quite a customary thing for Paul to employ the past
   indicative in the place of the subjunctive, by leaving the potential
   particle an, as it is called, to be supplied -- as, for example, in
   Romans 9:3, euchomen, for I would have wished; and in 1 Corinthians
   2:8; ei gar egnosan, if they had known. Every one, however, must
   perceive that Paul treats hitherto of Christ's glory, which tends to
   enhance his abasement. Accordingly he mentions, not what Christ did,
   but what it was allowable for him to do.

   Farther, that man is utterly blind who does not perceive that his
   eternal divinity is clearly set forth in these words. Nor does Erasmus
   act with sufficient modesty in attempting, by his cavils, to explain
   away this passage, as well as other similar passages. [106] He
   acknowledges, indeed, everywhere that Christ is God; but what am I the
   better for his orthodox confession, if my faith is not supported by any
   Scripture authority? I acknowledge, certainly, that Paul does not make
   mention here of Christ's divine essence; but it does not follow from
   this, that the passage is not sufficient for repelling the impiety of
   the Arians, who pretended that Christ was a created God, and inferior
   to the Father, and denied that he was consubstantial. [107] For where
   can there be equality with God without robbery, excepting only where
   there is the essence of God; for God always remains the same, who cries
   by Isaiah, I live; I will not give my glory to another. (Isaiah 48:11.)
   Form means figure or appearance, as they commonly speak. This, too, I
   readily grant; but will there be found, apart from God, such a form, so
   as to be neither false nor forged? As, then, God is known by means of
   his excellences, and his works are evidences of his eternal Godhead,
   (Romans 1:20,) so Christ's divine essence is rightly proved from
   Christ's majesty, which he possessed equally with the Father before he
   humbled himself. As to myself, at least, not even all devils would
   wrest this passage from me -- inasmuch as there is in God a most solid
   argument, from his glory to his essence, which are two things that are
   inseparable.

   7 Emptied himself. This emptying is the same as the abasement, as to
   which we shall see afterwards. The expression, however, is used,
   eumphatikoteros, (more emphatically,) to mean, -- being brought to
   nothing. Christ, indeed, could not divest himself of Godhead; but he
   kept it concealed for a time, that it might not be seen, under the
   weakness of the flesh. Hence he laid aside his glory in the view of
   men, not by lessening it, but by concealing it.

   It is asked, whether he did this as man? Erasmus answers in the
   affirmative. But where was the form of God before he became man? Hence
   we must reply, that Paul speaks of Christ wholly, as he was God
   manifested in the flesh, (1 Timothy 3:16;) but, nevertheless, this
   emptying is applicable exclusive to his humanity, as if I should say of
   man, "Man being mortal, he is exceedingly senseless if he thinks of
   nothing but the world," I refer indeed to man wholly; but at the same
   time I ascribe mortality only to a part of him, namely, to the body.
   As, then, Christ has one person, consisting of two natures, it is with
   propriety that Paul says, that he who was the Son of God, -- in reality
   equal to God, did nevertheless lay aside his glory, when he in the
   flesh manifested himself in the appearance of a servant.

   It is also asked, secondly, how he can be said to be emptied, while he,
   nevertheless, invariably proved himself, by miracles and excellences,
   to be the Son of God, and in whom, as John testifies, there was always
   to be seen a glory worthy of the Son of God? (John 1:14.) I answer,
   that the abasement of the flesh was, notwithstanding, like a vail, by
   which his divine majesty was concealed. On this account he did not wish
   that his transfiguration should be made public until after his
   resurrection; and when he perceives that the hour of his death is
   approaching, he then says, Father, glorify thy Son. (John 17:1.) Hence,
   too, Paul teaches elsewhere, that he was declared to be the Son of God
   by means of his resurrection. (Romans 1:4.) He also declares in another
   place, (2 Corinthians 13:4,) that he suffered through the weakness of
   the flesh. In fine, the image of God shone forth in Christ in such a
   manner, that he was, at the same time, abased in his outward
   appearance, and brought down to nothing in the estimation of men; for
   he carried about with him the form of a servant, and had assumed our
   nature, expressly with the view of his being a servant of the Father,
   nay, even of men. Paul, too, calls him the Minister of the
   Circumcision, (Romans 15:8;) and he himself testifies of himself, that
   he came to minister, (Matthew 20:28;) and that same thing had long
   before been foretold by Isaiah -- Behold my servant, etc. [108]

   In the likeness of men Genomenos is equivalent here to constitutus --
   (having been appointed.) For Paul means that he had been brought down
   to the level of mankind, so that there was in appearance nothing that
   differed from the common condition of mankind. The Marcionites
   perverted this declaration for the purpose of establishing the phantasm
   of which they dreamed. They can, however, be refuted without any great
   difficulty, inasmuch as Paul is treating here simply of the manner in
   which Christ manifested himself, and the condition with which he was
   conversant when in the world. Let one be truly man, he will
   nevertheless be reckoned unlike others, if he conducts himself as if he
   were exempt from the condition of others. Paul declares that it was not
   so as to Christ, but that he lived in such a manner, that he seemed as
   though he were on a level with mankind, and yet he was very different
   from a mere man, although he was truly man. The Marcionites therefore
   shewed excessive childishness, in drawing an argument from similarity
   of condition for the purpose of denying reality of nature. [109]

   Found means here, known or seen. For he treats, as has been observed,
   of estimation. In other words, as he had affirmed previously that he
   was truly God, the equal of the Father, so he here states, that he was
   reckoned, as it were, abject, and in the common condition of mankind.
   We must always keep in view what I said a little ago, that such
   abasement was voluntary.

   8 He became obedient. Even this was great humility -- that from being
   Lord he became a servant; but he says that he went farther than this,
   because, while he was not only immortal, but the Lord of life and
   death, he nevertheless became obedient to his Father, even so far as to
   endure death. This was extreme abasement, especially when we take into
   view the kind of death, which he immediately adds, with the view of
   enhancing it. [110] For by dying in this manner he was not only covered
   with ignominy in the sight of God, but was also accursed in the sight
   of God. It is assuredly such a pattern of humility as ought to absorb
   the attention of all mankind; so far is it from being possible to
   unfold it in words in a manner suitable to its dignity.

   9 Therefore God hath highly exalted. By adding consolation, he shews
   that abasement, to which the human mind is averse, is in the highest
   degree desirable. There is no one, it is true, but will acknowledge
   that it is a reasonable thing that is required from us, when we are
   exhorted to imitate Christ. This consideration, however, stirs us up to
   imitate him the more cheerfully, when we learn that nothing is more
   advantageous for us than to be conformed to his image. Now, that all
   are happy who, along with Christ, voluntarily abase themselves, he
   shews by his example; for from the most abject condition he was exalted
   to the highest elevation. Every one therefore that humbles himself will
   in like manner be exalted. Who would now be reluctant to exercise
   humility, by means of which the glory of the heavenly kingdom is
   attained?

   This passage has given occasion to sophists, or rather they have seized
   hold of it, to allege that Christ merited first for himself, and
   afterwards for others. Now, in the first place, even though there were
   nothing false alleged, it would nevertheless be proper to avoid such
   profane speculations as obscure the grace of Christ -- in imagining
   that he came for any other reason than with a view to our salvation.
   Who does not see that this is a suggestion of Satan -- that Christ
   suffered upon the cross, that he might acquire for himself, by the
   merit of his work, what he did not possess? For it is the design of the
   Holy Spirit, that we should, in the death of Christ, see, and taste,
   and ponder, and feel, and recognize nothing but God's unmixed goodness,
   and the love of Christ toward us, which was great and inestimable,
   that, regardless of himself, he devoted himself and his life for our
   sakes. In every instance in which the Scriptures speak of the death of
   Christ, they assign to us its advantage and price; -- that by means of
   it we are redeemed -- reconciled to God -- restored to righteousness --
   cleansed from our pollutions -- life is procured for us, and the gate
   of life opened. Who, then, would deny that it is at the instigation of
   Satan that the persons referred to maintain, on the other hand, that
   the chief part of the advantage is in Christ himself -- that a regard
   to himself had the precedence of that which he had to us -- that he
   merited glory for himself before he merited salvation for us?

   Farther, I deny the truth of what they allege, and I maintain that
   Paul's words are impiously perverted to the establishment of their
   falsehood; for that the expression, for this cause, denotes here a
   consequence rather than a reason, is manifest from this, that it would
   otherwise follow, that a man could merit Divine honors, and acquire the
   very throne of God -- which is not merely absurd, but even dreadful to
   make mention of. For of what exaltation of Christ does the Apostle here
   speak? It is, that everything may be accomplished in him that God, by
   the prophet Isaiah, exclusively claims to himself. Hence the glory of
   God, and the majesty, which is so peculiar to him, that it cannot be
   transferred to any other, will be the reward of man's work!

   Again, if they should urge the mode of expression, without any regard
   to the absurdity that will follow, the reply will be easy -- that he
   has been given us by the Father in such a manner, that his whole life
   is as a mirror that is set before us. As, then, a mirror, though it has
   splendor, has it not for itself, but with the view of its being
   advantageous and profitable to others, so Christ did not seek or
   receive anything for himself, but everything for us. For what need, I
   ask, had he, who was the equal of the Father, of a new exaltation? Let,
   then, pious readers learn to detest the Sorbonnic sophists with their
   perverted speculations.

   Hath given him a name Name here is employed to mean dignity -- a manner
   of expression which is abundantly common in all languages -- "Jacet
   sine nomine truncus; He lies a headless nameless carcass." [111] The
   mode of expression, however, is more especially common in Scripture.
   The meaning therefore is, that supreme power was given to Christ, and
   that he was placed in the highest rank of honor, so that there is no
   dignity found either in heaven or in earth that is equal to his. Hence
   it follows that it is a Divine name. [112] This, too, he explains by
   quoting the words of Isaiah, where the Prophet, when treating of the
   propagation of the worship of God throughout the whole world,
   introduces God as speaking thus: --

   "I live: every knee will bow to me, and every tongue will swear to me,"
   etc. (Isaiah 45:23.)

   Now, it is certain that adoration is here meant, which belongs
   peculiarly to God alone. I am aware that some philosophise with
   subtlety as to the name Jesus, as though it were derived from the
   ineffable name Jehovah. [113] In the reason, however, which they
   advance, I find no solidity. As for me, I feel no pleasure in empty
   subtleties; [114] and it is dangerous to trifle in a matter of such
   importance. Besides, who does not see that it is a forced, and anything
   rather than a genuine, exposition, when Paul speaks of Christ's whole
   dignity, to restrict his meaning to two syllables, as if any one were
   to examine attentively the letters of the word Alexander, in order to
   find in them the greatness of the name that Alexander acquired for
   himself. Their subtlety, therefore, is not solid, and the contrivance
   is foreign to Paul's intention. But worse than ridiculous is the
   conduct of the Sorbonnic sophists, who infer from the passage before us
   that we ought to bow the knee whenever the name of Jesus is pronounced,
   as though it were a magic word which had all virtue included in the
   sound of it. [115] Paul, on the other hand, speaks of the honor that is
   to be rendered to the Son of God--not to mere syllables.

   10 Every knee might bow. Though respect is shewn to men also be means
   of this rite, there can nevertheless be no doubt that what is here
   meant is that adoration which belongs exclusively to God, of which the
   bending of the knee is a token. [116] As to this, it is proper to
   notice, that God is to be worshipped, not merely with the inward
   affection of the heart, but also by outward profession, if we would
   render to him what is his due. Hence, on the other hand, when he would
   describe his genuine worshippers, he says that they

   have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.
   (1 Kings 19:18.)

   But here a question arises -- whether this relates to the divinity of
   Christ or to his humanity, for either of the two is not without some
   inconsistency, inasmuch as nothing new could be given to his divinity;
   and his humanity in itself, viewed separately, has by no means such
   exaltation belonging to it that it should be adored as God? I answer,
   that this, like many things else, is affirmed in reference to Christ's
   entire person, viewed as God manifested in the flesh. (1 Timothy 3:16.)
   For he did not abase himself either as to his humanity alone, or as to
   his divinity alone, but inasmuch as, clothed in our flesh, he concealed
   himself under its infirmity. So again God exalted his own Son in the
   same flesh, in which he had lived in the world abject and despised, to
   the highest rank of honor, that he may sit at his right hand.

   Paul, however, appears to be inconsistent with himself; for in Romans
   14:11, he quotes this same passage, when he has it in view to prove
   that Christ will one day be the judge of the living and the dead. Now,
   it would not be applicable to that subject, if it were already
   accomplished, as he here declares. I answer, that the kingdom of Christ
   is on such a footing, that it is every day growing and making
   improvement, while at the same time perfection is not yet attained, nor
   will be until the final day of reckoning. Thus both things hold true --
   that all things are now subject to Christ, and that this subjection
   will, nevertheless, not be complete until the day of the resurrection,
   because that which is now only begun will then be completed. Hence, it
   is not without reason that this prophecy is applied in different ways
   at different times, as also all the other prophecies, which speak of
   the reign of Christ, do not restrict it to one particular time, but
   describe it in its entire course. From this, however, we infer that
   Christ is that eternal God who spoke by Isaiah.

   Things in heaven, things on earth, things under the earth. Since Paul
   represents all things from heaven to hell as subject to Christ, Papists
   trifle childishly when they draw purgatory from his words. Their
   reasoning, however, is this -- that devils are so far from bowing the
   knee to Christ, that they are in every way rebellious against him, and
   stir up others to rebellion, as if it were not at the same time written
   that they tremble at the simple mention of God. (James 2:19.) How will
   it be, then, when they shall come before the tribunal of Christ? I
   confess, indeed, that they are not, and never will be, subject of their
   own accord and by cheerful submission; but Paul is not speaking here of
   voluntary obedience; nay more, we may, on the contrary, turn back upon
   them an argument, by way of retortion, (antistrephon,) in this manner:
   -- "The fire of purgatory, according to them, is temporary, and will be
   done away at the day of judgment: hence this passage cannot be
   understood as to purgatory, because Paul elsewhere declares that this
   prophecy will not be fulfilled until Christ shall manifest himself for
   judgment." Who does not see that they are twice children in respect of
   these disgusting frivolities? [117]

   11 Is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. It might also be read, In
   the glory, because the particle eis (to) is often used in place of en
   (in.) I prefer, however, to retain its proper signification, as
   meaning, that as the majesty of God has been manifested to men through
   Christ, so it shines forth in Christ, and the Father is glorified in
   the Son. See [4]John 5:17, and you will find an exposition of this
   passage.

   Philippians 2:12-16

   12. Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my
   presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own
   salvation with fear and trembling.

   12. Itaque amici mei, quemadmodum semper obedistis, ne quasi in
   praesentia mea solum, sed nunc multo magis in absentia mea, cum timore
   et tremore vestram salutem operamini:

   13. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his
   good pleasure.

   13. Deus enim est, qui efficit in vobis et velle et efficere, pro bona
   voluntate.

   14. Do all things without murmurings and disputings:

   14. Omnia facite absque murmurationibus et disceptationibus,

   15. That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without
   rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye
   shine as lights in the world;

   15. Ut sitis tales, de quibus nemo conqueratur, et sinceri filii Dei
   irreprehensibiles, in medio generationis pravae et tortuosae, inter
   quos lucete, tanquam luminaria in mundo:

   16. Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of
   Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.

   16. Sermonem vitae sustinentes, in gloriam meam, in diem Christi, quod
   non frustra cucurrerim, nec frustra laboraverim.


   12 Therefore, etc. He concludes the whole of the preceding exhortation
   with a general statement -- that they should humble themselves under
   the Lord's hand, for that will very readily secure, that, laying aside
   all arrogance, they will be gentle and indulgent to each other. This is
   the only befitting way in which the mind of man may learn gentleness,
   when one who, while viewing himself apart, pleased himself in his
   hiding-places, comes to examine himself as compared with God.

   As ye have always obeyed. He commends their previous obedience, that he
   may encourage them the more to persevere. As, however, it is the part
   of hypocrites to approve themselves before others, but so soon as they
   have withdrawn from public view, to indulge themselves more freely, as
   if every occasion of reverence and fear were removed, he admonishes
   them not to shew themselves obedient in his presence merely, but also,
   and even much more, in his absence. For if he were present, he could
   stimulate and urge them on by continued admonitions. Now, therefore,
   when their monitor is at a distance from them, [118] there is need that
   they should stir up themselves.

   With fear and trembling. In this way he would have the Philippians
   testify and approve their obedience -- by being submissive and humble.
   Now the source of humility is this -- acknowledging how miserable we
   are, and devoid of all good. To this he calls them in this statement.
   For whence comes pride, but from the assurance which blind confidence
   produces, when we please ourselves, and are more puffed up with
   confidence in our own virtue, than prepared to rest upon the grace of
   God. In contrast with this vice is that fear to which he exhorts. Now,
   although exhortation comes before doctrine, in the connection of the
   passage, it is in reality after it, in point of arrangement, inasmuch
   as it is derived from it. I shall begin, accordingly, with doctrine.

   13 It is God that worketh. This is the true engine for bringing down
   all haughtiness -- this the sword for putting an end to all pride, when
   we are taught that we are utterly nothing, and can do nothing, except
   through the grace of God alone. I mean supernatural grace, which comes
   forth from the spirit of regeneration. For, considered as men, we
   already are, and live and move in God. (Acts 17:28.) But Paul reasons
   here as to a kind of movement different from that universal one. Let us
   now observe how much he ascribes to God, and how much he leaves to us.

   There are, in any action, two principal departments -- the inclination,
   and the power to carry it into effect. Both of these he ascribes wholly
   to God; what more remains to us as a ground of glorying? Nor is there
   any reason to doubt that this division has the same force as if Paul
   had expressed the whole in a single word; for the inclination is the
   groundwork; the accomplishment of it is the summit of the building
   brought to a completion. He has also expressed much more than if he had
   said that God is the Author of the beginning and of the end. For in
   that case sophists would have alleged, by way of cavil, that something
   between the two was left to men. But as it is, what will they find that
   is in any degree peculiar to us? They toil hard in their schools to
   reconcile with the grace of God free-will -- of such a nature, I mean,
   as they conceive of -- which might be capable of turning itself by its
   own movement, and might have a peculiar and separate power, by which it
   might co-operate with the grace of God. I do not dispute as to the
   name, but as to the thing itself. In order, therefore, that free-will
   may harmonize with grace, they divide in such a manner, that God
   restores in us a free choice, that we may have it in our power to will
   aright. Thus they acknowledge to have received from God the power of
   willing aright, but assign to man a good inclination. Paul, however,
   declares this to be a work of God, without any reservation. For he does
   not say that our hearts are simply turned or stirred up, or that the
   infirmity of a good will is helped, but that a good inclination is
   wholly the work of God. [119]

   Now, in the calumny brought forward by them against us -- that we make
   men to be like stones, when we teach that they have nothing good,
   except from pure grace, they act a shameless part. For we acknowledge
   that we have from nature an inclination, but as it is depraved through
   the corruption of sin, it begins to be good only when it has been
   renewed by God. Nor do we say that a man does anything good without
   willing it, but that it is only when his inclination is regulated by
   the Spirit of God. Hence, in so far as concerns this department, we see
   that the entire praise is ascribed to God, and that what sophists teach
   us is frivolous -- that grace is offered to us, and placed, as it were,
   in the midst of us, that we may embrace it if we choose; for if God did
   not work in us efficaciously, he could not be said to produce in us a
   good inclination. As to the second department, we must entertain the
   same view. "God," says he, "is O energon to energein he that worketh in
   us to do." He brings, therefore, to perfection those pious dispositions
   which he has implanted in us, that they may not be unproductive, as he
   promises by Ezekiel, --

   "I will cause them to walk in my commandments."
   (Ezekiel 11:20.)

   From this we infer that perseverance, also, is his free gift.

   According to his good pleasure. Some explain this to mean -- the good
   intention of the mind. [120] I, on the other hand, take it rather as
   referring to God, and understand by it his benevolent disposition,
   which they commonly call beneplacitum, (good pleasure.) For the Greek
   word eudokia is very frequently employed in this sense; and the context
   requires it. For Paul has it in view to ascribe everything to God, and
   to take everything from us. Accordingly, not satisfied with having
   assigned to God the production both of willing and of doing aright, he
   ascribes both to his unmerited mercy. By this means he shuts out the
   contrivance of the sophists as to subsequent grace, which they imagine
   to be the reward of merit. Hence he teaches, that the whole course of
   our life, if we live aright, is regulated by God, and that, too, from
   his unmerited goodness.

   With fear and trembling. From this Paul deduces an exhortation -- that
   they must with fear work out their own salvation. He conjoins, as he is
   accustomed, fear and trembling, for the sake of greater intensity, to
   denote -- serious and anxious fear. He, accordingly, represses
   drowsiness as well as confidence. By the term work he reproves our
   indolence, which is always ingenious in seeking advantages. [121] Now
   it seems as if it had in the grace of God a sweet occasion of repose;
   for if He worketh in us, why should we not indulge ourselves at our
   ease? The Holy Spirit, however, calls us to consider, that he wishes to
   work upon living organs, but he immediately represses arrogance by
   recommending fear and trembling

   The inference, also, is to be carefully observed: "You have," says he,
   "all things from God; therefore be solicitous and humble." For there is
   nothing that ought to train us more to modesty and fear, than our being
   taught, that it is by the grace of God alone that we stand, and will
   instantly fall down, if he even in the slightest degree withdraw his
   hand. Confidence in ourselves produces carelessness and arrogance. We
   know from experience, that all who confide in their own strength, grow
   insolent through presumption, and at the same time, devoid of care,
   resign themselves to sleep. The remedy for both evils is, when,
   distrusting ourselves, we depend entirely on God alone. And assuredly,
   that man has made decided progress in the knowledge, both of the grace
   of God, and of his own weakness, who, aroused from carelessness,
   diligently seeks [122] God's help; while those that are puffed up with
   confidence in their own strength, must necessarily be at the same time
   in a state of intoxicated security. Hence it is a shameless calumny
   that Papists bring against us, -- that in extolling the grace of God,
   and putting down free-will, we make men indolent, shake off the fear of
   God, and destroy all feeling of concern. It is obvious, however, to
   every reader, that Paul finds matter of exhortation here -- not in the
   doctrine of Papists, but in what is held by us. "God," says he, "works
   all things in us; therefore submit to him with fear." I do not, indeed,
   deny that there are many who, on being told that there is in us nothing
   that is good, indulge themselves the more freely in their vices; but I
   deny that this is the fault of the doctrine, which, on the contrary,
   when received as it ought to be, produces in our hearts a feeling of
   concern.

   Papists, however, pervert this passage so as to shake the assurance of
   faith, for the man that trembles [123] is in uncertainty. They,
   accordingly, understand Paul's words as if they meant that we ought,
   during our whole life, to waver as to assurance of salvation. If,
   however, we would not have Paul contradict himself, he does not by any
   means exhort us to hesitation, inasmuch as he everywhere recommends
   confidence and (plerophorian) full assurance. The solution, however, is
   easy, if any one is desirous of attaining the true meaning without any
   spirit of contention. There are two kinds of fear; the one produces
   anxiety along with humility; the other hesitation. The former is
   opposed to fleshly confidence and carelessness, equally as to
   arrogance; the latter, to assurance of faith. Farther, we must take
   notice, that, as believers repose with assurance upon the grace of God,
   so, when they direct their views to their own frailty, they do not by
   any means resign themselves carelessly to sleep, but are by fear of
   dangers stirred up to prayer. Yet, so far is this fear from disturbing
   tranquillity of conscience, and shaking confidence, that it rather
   confirms it. For distrust of ourselves leads us to lean more
   confidently upon the mercy of God. And this is what Paul's words
   import, for he requires nothing from the Philippians, but that they
   submit themselves to God with true self-renunciation.

   Work out your own salvation. As Pelagians of old, so Papists at this
   day make a proud boast of this passage, with the view of extolling
   man's excellence. Nay more, when the preceding statement is mentioned
   to them by way of objection, It is God that worketh in us, etc., they
   immediately by this shield ward it off (so to speak) -- Work out your
   own salvation. Inasmuch, then, as the work is ascribed to God and man
   in common, they assign the half to each. In short, from the word work
   they derive free-will; from the term salvation they derive the merit of
   eternal life. I answer, that salvation is taken to mean the entire
   course of our calling, and that this term includes all things, by which
   God accomplishes that perfection, to which he has predestinated us by
   his gracious choice. This no one will deny, that is not obstinate and
   impudent. We are said to perfect it, when, under the regulation of the
   Spirit, we aspire after a life of blessedness. It is God that calls us,
   and offers to us salvation; it is our part to embrace by faith what he
   gives, and by obedience act suitably to his calling; but we have
   neither from ourselves. Hence we act only when he has prepared us for
   acting.

   The word which he employs properly signifies -- to continue until the
   end; but we must keep in mind what I have said, that Paul does not
   reason here as to how far our ability extends, but simply teaches that
   God acts in us in such a manner, that he, at the same time, does not
   allow us to be inactive, [124] but exercises us diligently, after
   having stirred us up by a secret influence. [125]

   14 Without murmurings. These are fruits of that humility to which he
   had exhorted them. For every man that has learned carefully to submit
   himself to God, without claiming anything for himself, will also
   conduct himself agreeably among men. When every one makes it his care
   to please himself, two faults prevail: First, they calumniate one
   another; and secondly, they strive against one another in contentions.
   In the first place, accordingly, he forbids malignity and secret
   enmities; and then, secondly, open contentions. He adds, thirdly, that
   they give no occasion to others to complain of them -- a thing which is
   wont to arise from excessive moroseness. It is true that hatred is not
   in all cases to be dreaded; but care must be taken, that we do not make
   ourselves odious through our own fault, so that the saying should be
   fulfilled in us, They hated me without a cause. (Psalm 35:19.) If,
   however, any one wishes to extend it farther, I do not object to it.
   For murmurings and disputations spring up, whenever any one, aiming
   beyond measure at his own advantage, [126] gives to others occasion of
   complaint. [127] Nay, even this expression may be taken in an active
   sense, so as to mean -- not troublesome or querulous. And this
   signification will not accord ill with the context, for a querulous
   temper (mempsimoiria) [128] is the seed of almost all quarrels and
   slanderings. He adds sincere, because these pollutions will never come
   forth from minds that have been purified.

   15 The sons of God, unreprovable. It ought to be rendered --
   unreprovable, because ye are the sons of God. For God's adoption of us
   ought to be a motive to a blameless life, that we may in some degree
   resemble our Father. Now, although there never has been such perfection
   in the world as to have nothing worthy of reproof, those are,
   nevertheless, said to be unreprovable who aim at this with the whole
   bent of their mind, as has been observed elsewhere. [129]

   In the midst of a wicked generation. Believers, it is true, live on
   earth, intermingled with the wicked; [130] they breathe the same air,
   they enjoy the same soil, and at that time [131] they were even more
   intermingled, inasmuch as there could scarcely be found a single pious
   family that was not surrounded on all sides by unbelievers. So much the
   more does Paul stir up the Philippians to guard carefully against all
   corruptions. The meaning therefore is this: "You are, it is true,
   inclosed in the midst of the wicked; but, in the mean time, bear in
   mind that you are, by God's adoption, separated from them: let there
   be, therefore, in your manner of life, conspicuous marks by which you
   may be distinguished. Nay more, this consideration ought to stir you up
   the more to aim at a pious and holy life, that we may not also be a
   part of the crooked generation, [132] entangled by their vices and
   contagion."

   As to his calling them a wicked and crooked generation, this
   corresponds with the connection of the passage. For he teaches us that
   we must so much the more carefully take heed on this account -- that
   many occasions of offense are stirred up by unbelievers, which disturb
   their right course; and the whole life of unbelievers is, as it were, a
   labyrinth of various windings, that draw us off from the right way.
   They are, however, notwithstanding, epithets of perpetual application,
   that are descriptive of unbelievers of all nations and in all ages. For
   if the heart of man is wicked and unsearchable, (Jeremiah 17:9,) what
   will be the fruits springing from such a root? Hence we are taught in
   these words, that in the life of man there is nothing pure, nothing
   right, until he has been renewed by the Spirit of God.

   Among whom shine ye. The termination of the Greek word is doubtful, for
   it might be taken as the indicative -- ye shine; but the imperative
   suits better with the exhortation. He would have believers be as lamps,
   which shine amidst the darkness of the world, as though he had said,
   "Believers, it is true, are children of the night, and there is in the
   world nothing but darkness; but God has enlightened you for this end,
   that the purity of your life may shine forth amidst that darkness, that
   his grace may appear the more illustrious." Thus, also, it is said by
   the Prophet,

   "The Lord will arise upon thee,
   and his glory will be seen upon thee."(Isaiah 60:2.)

   He adds immediately afterwards, "The Gentiles shall walk in thy light,
   and kings in the brightness of thy countenance." Though Isaiah speaks
   there rather of doctrine, while Paul speaks here of an exemplary life,
   yet, even in relation to doctrine, Christ in another passage specially
   designates the Apostles the light of the world. (Matthew 5:14.)

   16 Holding forth the word of life The reason why they ought to be
   luminaries is, that they carry the word of life, by which they are
   enlightened, that they may give light also to others. Now he alludes to
   lamps, in which wicks are placed that they may burn, and he makes us
   resemble the lamps; while he compares the word of God to the wick, from
   which the light comes. If you prefer another figure -- we are
   candlesticks: the doctrine of the gospel is the candle, which, being
   placed in us, diffuses light on all sides. Now he intimates, that we do
   injustice to the word of God, if it does not shine forth in us in
   respect of purity of life. This is the import of Christ's saying,

   "No man lighteth a candle,
   and putteth it under a bushel," etc. (Matthew 5:15.)

   We are said, however, to carry the word of life in such a way as to be,
   in the mean time, carried by it, [133] inasmuch as we are founded upon
   it. The manner, however, of carrying it, of which Paul speaks, is, that
   God has intrusted his doctrine with us on condition, not that we should
   keep the light of it under restraint, as it were, and inactive, but
   that we should hold it forth to others. The sum is this: that all that
   are enlightened with heavenly doctrine carry about with them a light,
   which detects and discovers their crimes, [134] if they do not walk in
   holiness and chastity; but that this light has been kindled up, not
   merely that they may themselves be guided in the right way, but that
   they may also shew it to others.

   That I may have glory. That he may encourage them the more, he declares
   that it will turn out to his glory, if he has not labored among them in
   vain. Not as if those who labored faithfully, but unsuccessfully, lost
   their pains, and had no reward of their labor. As, however, success in
   our ministry is a singular blessing from God, let us not feel
   surprised, if God, among his other gifts, makes this the crowning one.
   Hence, as Paul's Apostleship is now rendered illustrious by so many
   Churches, gained over to Christ through his instrumentality, so there
   can be no question that such trophies [135] will have a place in
   Christ's kingdom, as we will find him saying a little afterwards, You
   are my crown. (Philippians 4:1.) Nor can it be doubted, that the
   greater the exploits, the triumph will be the more splendid. [136]

   Should any one inquire how it is that Paul now glories in his labors,
   while he elsewhere forbids us to glory in any but in the Lord, (1
   Corinthians 1:31; 2 Corinthians 10:17,) the answer is easy -- that,
   when we have prostrated ourselves, and all that we have before God, and
   have placed in Christ all our ground of glorying, it is, at the same
   time, allowable for us to glory through Christ in God's benefits, as we
   have seen in the First Epistle to the Corinthians. [137] The
   expression, at the day of the Lord, is intended to stimulate the
   Philippians to perseverance, while the tribunal of Christ is set before
   their view, from which the reward of faith is to be expected.

   Philippians 2:17-24

   17. Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your
   faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.

   17. Quin etiam si immoler super hostia et sacrificio fidei vestrae,
   gaudeo et congaudeo vobis omnibus.

   18. For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.

   18. De hoc ipso gaudete, et congaudete mihi.

   19. But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you,
   that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.

   19. Spero autem in Domino, Timotheum brevi me ad vos missurum, ut ego
   tranquillo sim animo, postquam statum vestrum cognoverim.

   20. For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your
   state.

   20. Neminem enim habeo pari animo praeditum, qui germane res vestras
   curaturus sit.

   21. For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.

   21. Omnes enim quae sua sunt quaerunt: non quae sunt Christi Iesu.

   22. But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he
   hath served with me in the gospel.

   22. Porro experimentum eius tenetis, quod tanquam cum patre filius, ita
   mecum servivit in Euangelium.

   23. Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how
   it will go with me.

   23. Hunc igitur spero me missurum, simulac mea negotia videro.

   24. But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.

   24. Confido autem in Domino quod ipse quoque brevi sim venturus.


   17 If I should be offered. [138] The Greek word is spendomai, and
   accordingly there appears to be an allusion to those animals, by the
   slaughter of which agreements and treaties were confirmed among the
   ancients. For the Greeks specially employ the term spondas to denote
   the victims by which treaties are confirmed. In this way, he calls his
   death the confirmation of their faith, which it certainly would be.
   That, however, the whole passage may be more clearly understood, he
   says that he offered sacrifice to God, when he consecrated them by the
   gospel. There is a similar expression in Romans 15:16; for in that
   passage he represents himself as a priest, who offers up the Gentiles
   to God by the gospel. Now, as the gospel is a spiritual sword for
   slaying victims, [139] so faith is, as it were, the oblation; for there
   is no faith without mortification, by means of which we are consecrated
   to God.

   He makes use of the terms, kai leitourgian -- sacrifice and service,
   the former of which refers to the Philippians, who had been offered up
   to God; and the latter to Paul, for it is the very act of sacrificing.
   The term, it is true, is equivalent to administration, and thus it
   includes functions and offices of every kind; but here it relates
   properly to the service of God -- corresponding to the phrase made use
   of by the Latins -- operari sacris -- (to be employed in sacred rites
   [140] ) Now Paul says that he will rejoice, if he shall be offered up
   upon a sacrifice of this nature -- that it may be the more ratified and
   confirmed. This is to teach the gospel from the heart -- when we are
   prepared to confirm with our own blood what we teach.

   From this, however, a useful lesson is to be gathered as to the nature
   of faith -- that it is not a vain thing, but of such a nature as to
   consecrate man to God. The ministers of the gospel have, also, here a
   singular consolation in being called priests of God, to present victims
   to him; [141] for with what ardor ought that man to apply himself to
   the pursuit of preaching, who knows that this is an acceptable
   sacrifice to God! The wretched Papists, having no knowledge of this
   kind of sacrifice, contrive another, which is utter sacrilege.

   I rejoice with you, says he -- so that if it should happen that he
   died, they would know that this took place for their profit, and would
   receive advantage from his death.

   18 Rejoice ye. By the alacrity which he thus discovers, he encourages
   the Philippians, and enkindles in them a desire to meet death with
   firmness, [142] inasmuch as believers suffer no harm from it. For he
   has formerly taught them that death would be gain to himself,
   (Philippians 1:21;) here, on the other hand, he is chiefly concerned
   that his death may not disconcert the Philippians. [143] He,
   accordingly, declares that it is no ground of sorrow; nay, that they
   have occasion of joy, inasmuch as they will find it to be productive of
   advantage. For, although it was in itself a serious loss to be deprived
   of such a teacher, it was no slight compensation that the gospel was
   confirmed by his blood. In the mean time, he lets them know that to
   himself personally death would be matter of joy. The rendering of
   Erasmus, taking it in the present tense, Ye rejoice, is altogether
   unsuitable.

   19 But I hope. He promises them the coming of Timothy, that, from their
   expecting him, they may bear up more courageously, and not give way to
   impostors. For as in war an expectation of help animates soldiers, so
   as to keep them from giving way, so this consideration, too, was fitted
   to encourage greatly the Philippians: "There will one come very
   shortly, who will set himself in opposition to the contrivances of our
   enemies." But if the mere expectation of him had so much influence, his
   presence would exert a much more powerful effect. We must take notice
   of the condition [144] -- in respect of which he submits himself to the
   providence of God, forming no purpose, but with that leading the way,
   as assuredly it is not allowable to determine anything as to the
   future, except, so to speak, under the Lord's hand. When he adds, that
   I may be in tranquillity, he declares his affection towards them,
   inasmuch as he was so much concerned as to their dangers, that he was
   not at ease until he received accounts of their prosperity.

   20 I have no man like-minded. While some draw another meaning from the
   passage, I interpret it thus: "I have no one equally well-affected for
   attending to your interests." For Paul, in my opinion, compares Timothy
   with others, rather than with himself, and he pronounces this eulogium
   upon him, with the express design that he may be the more highly
   esteemed by them for his rare excellence.

   21 For all seek their own things. He does not speak of those who had
   openly abandoned the pursuit of piety, but of those very persons whom
   he reckoned brethren, nay, even those whom he admitted to familiar
   intercourse with him. These persons, he nevertheless says, were so warm
   in the pursuit of their own interests, that they were unbecomingly cold
   in the work of the Lord. It may seem at first view as if it were no
   great fault to seek one's own profit; but how insufferable it is in the
   servants of Christ, appears from this, that it renders those that give
   way to it utterly useless. For it is impossible that the man who is
   devoted to self, should apply himself to the interests of the Church.
   Did then, you will say, Paul cultivate the society of men that were
   worthless and mere pretenders? I answer, that it is not to be
   understood, as if they had been intent exclusively on their own
   interests, and bestowed no care whatever upon the Church, but that,
   taken up with their own individual interests, they were to some extent
   negligent to the promotion of the public advantage of the Church. For
   it must necessarily be, that one or other of two dispositions prevails
   over us -- either that, overlooking ourselves, we are devoted to
   Christ, and those things that are Christ's, or that, unduly intent on
   our own advantage, we serve Christ in a superficial manner.

   From this it appears, how great a hinderance it is to Christ's
   ministers to seek their own interests. Nor is there any force in these
   excuses: "I do harm to no one" -- "I must have a regard, also, to my
   own advantage" -- "I am not so devoid of feeling as not to be prompted
   by a regard to my own advantage." For you must give up your own right
   if you would discharge your duty: a regard to your own interests must
   not be put in preference to Christ's glory, or even placed upon a level
   with it. Whithersoever Christ calls you, you must go promptly, leaving
   off all other things. Your calling ought to be regarded by you in such
   a way, that you shall turn away all your powers of perception from
   everything that would impede you. It might be in your power to live
   elsewhere in greater opulence, but God has bound you to the Church,
   which affords you but a very moderate sustenance: you might elsewhere
   have more honor, but God has assigned you a situation, in which you
   live in a humble style: [145] you might have elsewhere a more
   salubrious sky, or a more delightful region, but it is here that your
   station is appointed. You might wish to have to do with a more humane
   people: you feel offended with their ingratitude, or barbarity, or
   pride; in short, you have no sympathy with the disposition or the
   manners of the nation in which you are, but you must struggle with
   yourself, and do violence in a manner to opposing inclinations, that
   you may [146] keep by the trade you have got; [147] for you are not
   free, or at your own disposal. In fine, forget yourself, if you would
   serve God.

   If, however, Paul reproves so severely those who were influenced by a
   greater concern for themselves than for the Church, what judgment may
   be looked for by those who, while altogether devoted to their own
   affairs, make no account of the edification of the Church? However they
   may now flatter themselves, God will not spare them. An allowance must
   be given to the ministers of the Church to seek their own interests, so
   as not to be prevented from seeking the kingdom of Christ; but in that
   case they will not be represented as seeking their own interests, as a
   man's life is estimated according to its chief aim. When he says all,
   we are not to understand the term denoting universality, as though it
   implied that there was no exception, for there were others also, such
   as Epaphroditus, [148] but there were few of these, and he ascribes to
   all what was very generally prevalent.

   When, however, we hear Paul complaining, that in that golden age, in
   which all excellences flourished, that there were so few that were
   rightly affected, [149] let us not be disheartened, if such is our
   condition in the present day: only let every one take heed to himself,
   that he be not justly reckoned to belong to that catalogue. I should
   wish, however, that Papists would answer me one question -- where Peter
   was at that time, for he must have been at Rome, if what they say is
   true. O the sad and vile description that Paul gave of him! They utter,
   therefore, mere fables, when they pretend that he at that time presided
   over the Church of Rome. Observe, that the edification of the Church is
   termed the things of Christ, because we are truly engaged in his work,
   when we labor in the cultivation of his vineyard.

   22 But the proof. It is literally, ye know the proof of him, unless you
   prefer to understand it in the imperative mood, know ye; (for there had
   scarcely been opportunity during that short time to make trial,) but
   this is not of great moment. What is chiefly to be noticed is, that he
   furnishes Timothy with an attestation of fidelity and modesty. In
   evidence of his fidelity, he declares, that he had served with him in
   the gospel, for such a connection was a token of true sincerity. In
   evidence of his modesty, he states, that he had submitted to him as to
   a father. It is not to be wondered, that this virtue is expressly
   commended by Paul, for it has in all ages been rare. At the present
   day, where will you find one among the young that will give way to his
   seniors, even in the smallest thing? to such an extent does
   impertinence triumph and prevail in the present age! In this passage,
   as in many others, we see how diligently Paul makes it his aim to put
   honor upon pious ministers, and that not so much for their own sakes,
   as on the ground of its being for the advantage of the whole Church,
   that such persons should be loved and honored, and possess the highest
   authority.

   24 I trust that I myself. He adds this, too, lest they should imagine
   that anything had happened to change his intention as to the journey of
   which he had previously made mention. At the same time, he always
   speaks conditionally -- If it shall please the Lord. For although he
   expected deliverance from the Lord, yet there having been, as we have
   observed, no express promise, this expectation was by no means settled,
   but was, as it were, suspended upon the secret purpose of God.

   Philippians 2:25-30

   25. Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my
   brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your
   messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.

   25. Porro necessarium existimavi Epaphroditum, fratrem et cooperarium,
   et commilitonem meum, Apostolum autem vestrum, et ministrum
   necessitatis meae mittere ad vos.

   26. For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because
   that ye had heard that he had been sick.

   26. Quandoquidem desiderabat vos omnes, et erat anxius animi, propterea
   quod audieratis ipsum infirmatum fuisse.

   27. For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him;
   and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon
   sorrow.

   27. Et certe infirmatus fuit, ut esset morti vicinus, sed Deus misertus
   est illius: neque illius solum, sed etiam mei; ut ne tristitiam super
   tristitiam haberem.

   28. I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him
   again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.

   28. Studiosius itaque misi illum, ut eo viso rursus gaudeatis, et ego
   magis vacem dolore.

   29. Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such
   in reputation:

   29. Excipite ergo illum in Domino cum omni gaudio: et qui tales sunt,
   in pretio habete:

   30. Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not
   regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.

   30. Quia propter opus Christi usque ad mortem accessit, exponens
   periculo animam, ut sufficeret quod deerat vestro erga me ministerio,
   (vel, officio.)


   25 I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus. After having
   encouraged them by the promise of his own coming and that of Timothy,
   he fortifies them also for the present, by sending previously
   Epaphroditus, that in the mean time, while he waited the issue of his
   own affairs, (for this was the cause of his delay,) they might not be
   in want of a pastor who should take care that matters were properly
   managed. Now, he recommends Epaphroditus by many distinctions -- that
   he is his brother, and helper in the affairs of the gospel -- that he
   is his fellow-soldier, by which term he intimates what is the condition
   of the ministers of the gospel; that they are engaged in an incessant
   warfare, for Satan will not allow them to promote the gospel without
   maintaining a conflict. Let those, then, who prepare themselves for
   edifying the Church, know that war is denounced against them, and
   prepared. This, indeed, is common to all Christians -- to be soldiers
   in the camp of Christ, [150] for Satan is the enemy of all. It is,
   however, more particularly applicable to the ministers of the word, who
   go before the army and bear the standard. Paul, however, more
   especially might boast of his military service, [151] inasmuch as he
   was exercised to a very miracle in every kind of contest. He
   accordingly commends Epaphroditus, because he had been a companion to
   him in his conflicts.

   The term Apostle here, as in many other passages, is taken generally to
   mean any evangelist, [152] unless any one prefers to understand it as
   meaning an ambassador sent by the Philippians, so that it may be
   understood as conjoining these two things -- an ambassador to afford
   service to Paul. [153] The former signification, however, is in my
   opinion more suitable. He mentions also, among other things, to his
   praise, that he had ministered to him in prison -- a matter which will
   be treated of more fully ere long.

   26. He longed after you. It is a sign of a true pastor, that while he
   was at a great distance, and was willingly detained by a pious
   engagement, he was nevertheless affected with concern for his flock,
   and a longing after them; and on learning that his sheep were
   distressed on his account, [154] he was concerned as to their grief. On
   the other hand, the anxiety of the Philippians for their pastor is here
   discovered.

   27 But God had mercy on him. He had expressed the severity of the
   disease -- that Epaphroditus had been sick, so that life was despaired
   of, in order that the goodness of God might shine forth more clearly in
   his restored health. It is, however, surprising that he should ascribe
   it to the mercy of God that Epaphroditus had had his period of life
   prolonged, while he had previously declared that he desired death in
   preference to life. (Philippians 1:23.) And what were better for us
   than that we should remove hence to the kingdom of God, delivered from
   the many miseries of this world, and more especially, rescued from that
   bondage of sin in which he elsewhere exclaims that he is wretched,
   (Romans 7:24,) to attain the full enjoyment of that liberty of the
   Spirit, by which we become connected with the Son of God? [155] It were
   tedious to enumerate all the things which tend to make death better
   than life to believers, and more to be desired. Where, then, is there
   any token of the mercy of God, when it does nothing but lengthen out
   our miseries? I answer, that all these things do not prevent this life
   from being, nevertheless, considered in itself, an excellent gift of
   God. More especially those who live to Christ are happily exercised
   here in hope of heavenly glory; and accordingly, as we have had
   occasion to see a little ago, life is gain to them. [156] Besides,
   there is another thing, too, that is to be considered -- that it is no
   small honor that is conferred upon us, when God glorifies himself in
   us; for it becomes us to look not so much to life itself, as to the end
   for which we live.

   But on me also, lest I should have sorrow. Paul acknowledges that the
   death of Epaphroditus would have been bitterly painful to him, and he
   recognises it as an instance of God's sparing mercy toward himself,
   that he had been restored to health. He does not, therefore, make it
   his boast that he has the apathy (apatheian) of the Stoics, as if he
   were a man of iron, and exempt from human affections. [157] "What
   then!" some one will say, "where is that unconquerable
   magnanimity?--where is that indefatigable perseverance?" I answer, that
   Christian patience differs widely from philosophical obstinacy, and
   still more from the stubborn and fierce sterness of the Stoics. For
   what excellence were there in patiently enduring the cross, if there
   were in it no feeling of pain and bitterness? But when the consolation
   of God overcomes that feeling, so that we do not resist, but, on the
   contrary, give our back to the endurance of the rod, (Isaiah 50:5,) we
   in that case present to God a sacrifice of obedience that is acceptable
   to him. Thus Paul acknowledges that he felt some uneasiness and pain
   from his bonds, but that he nevertheless cheerfully endured these same
   bonds for the sake of Christ. [158] He acknowledges that he would have
   felt the death of Epaphroditus an event hard to be endured, but he
   would at length have brought his temper of mind into accordance with
   the will of God, although all reluctance was not yet fully removed; for
   we give proof of our obedience, only when we bridle our depraved
   affections, and do not give way to the infirmity of the flesh. [159]

   Two things, therefore, are to be observed: in the first place, that the
   dispositions which God originally implanted in our nature are not evil
   in themselves, because they do not arise from the fault of corrupt
   nature, but come forth from God as their Author; of this nature is the
   grief that is felt on occasion of the death of friends: in the second
   place, that Paul had many other reasons for regret in connection with
   the death of Epaphroditus, and that these were not merely excusable,
   but altogether necessary. This, in the first place, is invariable in
   the case of all believers, that, on occasion of the death of any one,
   they are reminded of the anger of God against sin; but Paul was the
   more affected with the loss sustained by the Church, which he saw would
   be deprived of a singularly good pastor at a time when the good were so
   few in number. Those who would have dispositions of this kind
   altogether subdued and eradicated, do not picture to themselves merely
   men of flint, but men that are fierce and savage. In the depravity of
   our nature, however, everything in us is so perverted, that in whatever
   direction our minds are bent, they always go beyond bounds. Hence it is
   that there is nothing that is so pure or right in itself, as not to
   bring with it some contagion. Nay more, Paul, as being a man, would, I
   do not deny, have experienced in his grief something of human error,
   [160] for he was subject to infirmity, and required to be tried with
   temptations, in order that he might have occasion of victory by
   striving and resisting.

   28 I have sent him the more carefully. The presence of Epaphroditus was
   no small consolation to him; yet to such a degree did he prefer the
   welfare of the Philippians to his own advantage, that he says that he
   rejoices on occasion of his departure, because it grieved him that, on
   his account, he was taken away from the flock that was intrusted to
   him, and was reluctant to avail himself of his services, though
   otherwise agreeable to him, when it was at the expense of loss to them.
   Hence he says, that he will feel more happiness in the joy of the
   Philippians.

   29 Receive him with all joy. He employs the word all to mean sincere
   and abundant. He also recommends him again to the Philippians; so
   intent is he upon this, that all that approve themselves as good and
   faithful pastors may be held in the highest estimation: for he does not
   speak merely of one, but exhorts that all such should be held in
   estimation; for they are precious pearls from God's treasuries, and the
   rarer they are, they are so much the more worthy of esteem. Nor can it
   be doubted that God often punishes our ingratitude and proud disdain,
   by depriving us of good pastors, when he sees that the most eminent
   that are given by him are ordinarily despised. Let every one, then, who
   is desirous that the Church should be fortified against the stratagems
   and assaults of wolves, make it his care, after the example of Paul,
   that the authority of good pastors be established; [161] as, on the
   other hand, there is nothing upon which the instruments of the devil
   are more intent, than on undermining it by every means in their power.

   30 Because for the work of Christ. I consider this as referring to that
   infirmity, which he had drawn down upon himself by incessant assiduity.
   Hence he reckons the distemper of Epaphroditus among his excellences,
   as it certainly was a signal token of his ardent zeal. Sickness,
   indeed, is not an excellence, but it is an excellence not to spare
   yourself that you may serve Christ. Epaphroditus felt that his health
   would be in danger if he applied himself beyond measure; yet he would
   rather be negligent as to health than be deficient in duty; and that he
   may commend this conduct the more to the Philippians, he says that it
   was a filling up of their deficiency, [162] because, being situated at
   a distance, they could not furnish aid to Paul at Rome. Hence
   Epaphroditus, having been sent for this purpose, acted in their stead.
   [163] He speaks of the services rendered to him as the work of the
   Lord, as assuredly there is nothing in which we can better serve God,
   than when we help his servants who labor for the truth of the gospel.

   Philippians 3:1-6

   1. Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things
   to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but you it is safe.

   1. Quod reliquum est, fratres, mei, gaudete in Domino; eadem scribere
   vobis, me equidem, haud piget, vobis autem tutm est.

   2. Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.

   2. Videte canes, videte malos operarios, videte concisionem.

   3. For we are the cirmcumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and
   rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.

   3. Nos enim sumus cicrcumcisio, qui spiritu Deum colimus, et gloriamur
   in Christo Iesu, non autem in carne confidimus.

   4. Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man
   thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:

   4. Tametsi ego etiam in carne fiduciam habeo. Si qauis alius videtur
   confidere in carne, ego magis:

   5. Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of
   Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;

   5. Circumcisus die occtavo, ex genere Israel, tribu Beniamin, Hebraeus
   ex Hebraeis, secundum legem Pharisaeus:

   6. Concerning zeal, persecuting the Church; touching the righteousness
   which is in the law, blameless.

   6. Secundum zelum persequens Ecclesiam, secundum iustitiam, quae est in
   lege, irreprehensibilis.


   1 Rejoice in the Lord This is a conclusion from what goes before, for
   as Satan never ceased to distress them with daily rumors, he bids them
   divest themselves of anxiety and be of good courage. In this way he
   exhorts them to constancy, that they may not fall back from the
   doctrine which they have once received. The phrase henceforward denotes
   a continued course, that, in the midst of many hinderances, they may
   not cease to exercise holy joy. It is a rare excellence when Satan
   endeavors to exasperate us [164] by means of the bitterness of the
   cross, so as to make God's name unpleasant [165] , to take such
   satisfaction in the simple tasting of God's grace, that all annoyances,
   sorrows, anxieties, and griefs are sweetened.

   To write the same thing to you. Here he begins to speak of the false
   Apostles, with whom, however, he does not fight hand to hand, as in the
   Epistle to the Galatians, but in a few words severely [166] exposes
   them, as far as was sufficient. For as they had simply made an attempt
   upon the Philippians, and had not made an inroad upon them, [167] it
   was not so necessary to enter into any regular disputation with the
   view of refuting errors, to which they had never lent an ear. Hence he
   simply admonishes them to be diligent and attentive in detecting
   impostors and guarding against them.

   In the first place, however, he calls them dogs; the metaphor being
   grounded upon this -- that, for the sake of filling their belly, they
   assailed true doctrine with their impure barking. Accordingly, it is as
   though he had said, -- impure or profane persons; for I do not agree
   with those who think that they are so called on the ground of envying
   others, or biting them [168]

   In the second place, he calls them evil workers, meaning, that, under
   the pretext of building up the Church, they did nothing but ruin and
   destroy everything; for many are busily occupied [169] who would do
   better to remain idle. As the public crier [170] on being asked by
   Gracchus in mockery, on the ground of his sitting idle, what he was
   doing? had his answer ready, "Nay, but what are you doing?" for he was
   the ringleader of a ruinous sedition. Hence Paul would have a
   distinction made among workers, that believers may be on their guard
   against those that are evil.

   In the third term employed, there is an elegant (prosonomasia) play
   upon words. They boasted that they were the circumcision: he turns
   aside this boasting by calling them the concision [171] , inasmuch as
   they tore asunder the unity of the Church. In this we have an instance
   tending to shew that the Holy Spirit in his organs [172] has not in
   every case avoided wit and humor, yet so as at the same time to keep at
   a distance from such pleasantry as were unworthy of his majesty. There
   are innumerable examples in the Prophets, and especially in Isaiah, so
   that there is no profane author that abounds more in agreeable plays
   upon words, and figurative forms of expression. We ought, however, more
   carefully still to observe the vehemence with which Paul inveighs
   against the false Apostles, which will assuredly break forth wherever
   there is the ardor of pious zeal. But in the mean time we must be on
   our guard lest any undue warmth or excessive bitterness should creep in
   under a pretext of zeal.

   When he says, that to write the same things is not grievous to him, he
   seems to intimate that he had already written on some other occasion to
   the Philippians. There would, however, be no inconsistency in
   understanding him as meaning, that he now by his writings reminds them
   of the same things as they had frequently heard him say, when he was
   with them. For there can be no doubt that he had often intimated to
   them in words, when he was with them, how much they ought to be on
   their guard against such pests: yet he does not grudge to repeat these
   things, because the Philippians would have incurred danger in the event
   of his silence. And, unquestionably, it is the part of a good pastor,
   not merely to supply the flock with pasture, and to rule the sheep by
   his guidance, but to drive away the wolves when threatening to make an
   attack upon the fold, and that not merely on one occasion, but so as to
   be constantly on the watch, and to be indefatigable. For as thieves and
   robbers (John 10:8) are constantly on the watch for the destruction of
   the Church, what excuse will the pastor have if, after courageously
   repelling them in several instances, he gives way on occasion of the
   ninth or tenth attack?

   He says also, that a repetition of this nature is profitable to the
   Philippians, lest they should be--as is wont to happen occasionally--of
   an exceedingly fastidious humor, and despise it as a thing that was
   superfluous. For many are so difficult to please, that they cannot bear
   that the same thing should be said to them a second time, and, in the
   mean time, they do not consider that what is inculcated upon them daily
   is with difficulty retained in their memory ten years afterwards. But
   if it was profitable to the Philippians to listen to this exhortation
   of Paul--to be on their guard against wolves, what do Papists mean who
   will not allow that any judgment should be formed as to their doctrine?
   For to whom, I pray you, did Paul address himself when he said, Beware?
   Was it not to those whom they do not allow to possess any right to
   judge? And of the same persons Christ says, in like manner,

   My sheep hear my voice, and they follow me; they flee from, a stranger,
   and they hear not his voice. (John 10:5, 27.)

   3. For we are the circumcision--that is, we are the true seed of
   Abraham, and heirs of the testament which was confirmed by the sign of
   circumcision. For the true circumcision is of the spirit and not of the
   letter, inward, and situated in the heart, not visible according to the
   flesh. (Romans 2:29.)

   By spiritual worship he means that which is recommended to us in the
   gospel, and consists of confidence in God, and invocation of him,
   self-renunciation, and a pure conscience. We must supply an antithesis,
   for he censures, on the other hand, legal worship, which was
   exclusively pressed upon them by the false Apostles.

   "They command that God should be worshipped with outward observances,
   and because they observe the ceremonies of the law, they boast on false
   grounds that they are the people of God; but we are the truly
   circumcised, who worship God in spirit and in truth." (John 4:23.)

   But here some one will ask, whether truth excludes the sacraments, for
   the same thing might be said as to Baptism and the Lord's Supper. I
   answer, that this principle must always be kept in view, that figures
   were abolished by the advent of Christ, and that circumcision gave way
   to baptism. It follows, also, from this principle, that the pure and
   genuine worship of God is free from the legal ceremonies, and that
   believers have the true circumcision without any figure.

   And we glory in Christ We must always keep in view the antithesis. "We
   have to do with the reality, while they rest in the symbols: we have to
   do with the substance, while they look to the shadows." And this suits
   sufficiently well with the corresponding clause, which he adds by way
   of contrast-- We have no confidence in the flesh For under the term
   flesh he includes everything of an external kind in which an individual
   is prepared to glory, as will appear from the context, or, to express
   it in fewer words, he gives the name of flesh to everything that is
   apart from Christ. He thus reproves, and in no slight manner, the
   perverse zealots the law, because, not satisfied with Christ, they have
   recourse to grounds of glorying apart from him. He has employed the
   terms glorying, and having confidence, to denote the same thing. For
   confidence lifts up a man, so that he ventures even to glory, and thus
   the two things are connected.

   4 Though I might also He does not speak of the disposition exercised by
   him, but he intimates, that he has also ground of glorying, if he were
   inclined to imitate their folly. The meaning therefore is, "My
   glorying, indeed, is placed in Christ, but, were it warrantable to
   glory in the flesh, I have also no want of materials." And from this we
   learn in what manner to reprove the arrogance of those who glory in
   something apart from Christ. If we are ourselves in possession of those
   very things in which they glory, let us not allow them to triumph over
   Christ by an unseemly boasting, without retorting upon them also our
   grounds of glorying, that they may understand that it is not through
   envy that we reckon of no value, nay, even voluntarily renounce those
   things on which they set the highest value. Let, however, the
   conclusion be always of this nature -- that all confidence in the flesh
   is vain and preposterous.

   If any one has confidence in the flesh, I more Not satisfied with
   putting himself on a level with any one of them, he even gives himself
   the preference to them. Hence he cannot on this account be suspected,
   as though he were envious of their excellence, and extolled Christ with
   the view of making his own deficiencies appear the less inconsiderable.
   He says, therefore, that, if it were coming to be matter of dispute, he
   would be superior to others. For they had nothing (as we shall see
   erelong) that he had not on his part equally with them, while in some
   things he greatly excelled them. He says, not using the term in its
   strict sense, that he has confidence in the flesh, on the ground that,
   while not placing confidence in them, he was furnished with those
   grounds of fleshly glorying, on account of which they were puffed up.

   5. Circumcised on the eighth day It is literally-- "The circumcision of
   the eighth day." There is no difference, however, in the sense, for the
   meaning is, that he was circumcised in the proper manner, and according
   to the appointment of the law [173] . Now this customary circumcision
   was reckoned of superior value; and, besides, it was a token of the
   race to which he belonged; on which he touches immediately afterwards.
   For the case was not the same as to foreigners, for after they had
   become proselytes they were circumcised in youth, or when grown up to
   manhood, and sometimes even in old age. He says, accordingly, that he
   is of the race of Israel He names the tribe [174] , -- not, in my
   opinion, on the ground that the tribe of Benjamin had a superiorityof
   excellence above others, but for shewing more fully that he belonged to
   the race of Israel, as it was the custom that every one was numbered
   according to his particular tribe. With the same view he adds still
   farther, that he is an Hebrew of the Hebrews For this name was the most
   ancient, as being that by which Abraham himself is designated by Moses.
   (Genesis 14:13.) [175] The sum, therefore, is this -- that Paul was
   descended from the seed of Jacob from the most ancient date, so that he
   could reckon up grandfathers and great-grandfathers, and could even go
   still farther back.

   According to the law, a Pharisee Having spoken of the nobility of his
   descent, he now proceeds to speak of special endowments of persons, as
   they are called. It is very generally known, that the sect of the
   Pharisees was celebrated above the others for the renown in which it
   was held for sanctity and for doctrine. He states, that he belonged to
   that sect. The common opinion is, that the Pharisees were so called
   from a term signifying separation [176] ; but I approve rather of what
   I learned at one time from Capito, a man of sacred memory [177] , that
   it was because they boasted that they were endowed with the gift of
   interpreting Scripture, for phrs (parash,) among the Hebrews, conveys
   the idea of interpretation. [178] While others declared themselves to
   be literals [179] , they preferred to be regarded as Pharisees [180] ,
   as being in possession of the interpretations of the ancients. And
   assuredly it is manifest that, under the pretext of antiquity, they
   corrupted the whole of Scripture by their inventions; but as they, at
   the same time, retained some sound interpretations, handed down by the
   ancients, they were held in the highest esteem.

   But what is meant by the clause, according to the law? For
   unquestionably nothing is more opposed to the law of God than sects,
   for in it is communicated the truth of God, which is the bond of unity.
   Besides this, Josephus tells us in the 13th book of his Antiquities,
   that all the sects took their rise during the high priesthood of
   Jonathan. Paul employs the term law, not in its strict sense, to denote
   the doctrine of religion, however much corrupted it was at that time,
   as Christianity is at this day in the Papacy. As, however, there were
   many that were in the rank of teachers, who were less skillful, and
   exercised [181] he makes mention also of his zeal. It was, indeed, a
   very heinous sin on the part of Paul to persecute the Church, but as he
   had to dispute with unprincipled persons, who, by mixing up Christ with
   Moses, pretended zeal for the law, he mentions, on the other hand, that
   he was so keen a zealot of the law, that on that ground he persecuted
   the Church

   6. As to the righteousness which is in the law There can be no doubt he
   means by this the entire righteousness of the law, for it were too
   meagre a sense to understand it exclusively of the ceremonies. The
   meaning, therefore, is more general -- that he cultivated an integrity
   of life, such as might be required on the part of a man that was
   devoted to the law. To this, again, it is objected, that the
   righteousness of the law is perfect in the sight of God. For the sum of
   it is -- that men be fully devoted to God, and what beyond this can be
   desired for the attainment of perfection? I answer, that Paul speaks
   here of that righteousness which would satisfy the common opinion of
   mankind. For he separates the law from Christ. Now, what is the law
   without Christ but a dead letter? To make the matter plainer, I
   observe, that there are two righteousnesses of the law. The one is
   spiritual -- perfect love to God, and our neighbors: it is contained in
   doctrine, and had never an existence in the life of any man. The other
   is literal -- such as appears in the view of men, while, in the mean
   time, hypocrisy reigns in the heart, and there is in the sight of God
   nothing but iniquity. Thus, the law has two aspects; the one has an eye
   to God, the other to men. Paul, then, was in the judgment of men holy,
   and free from all censure -- a rare commendation, certainly, and almost
   unrivalled; yet let us observe in what esteem he held it.

   7. But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.

   7. Verum quae mihi lucra erant, ea existimavi propter Christum
   iacturam.

   8. Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of
   the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the
   loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,

   8. Quin etiam omnia existimo iacturam esse, propter eminentiam
   cognitionis Christi Iesu Domini mei: propter quem omnium iacturam feci
   et existimo reiectamenta esse, ut Christum lucri faciam.

   9. And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of
   the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the
   righteousness which is of God by faith:

   9. Et inveniam [182] in ipso, non habens meam iustitiam que ex Lege
   est, sed quae est per fidem Christi: quae, inquam, ex Deo est iustitia
   in fide.

   10. That I may knowhim, and the power of his resurrection, and the
   fellowship of his sufferings, being made comformable unto his death;

   10. Ut cognoscam ipsu, et potentiam resurrectionis eius, et
   communicationem passionumeius, dum configuror morti eius,

   11. If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.

   11. Si quo modo perveniam ad resurrectionem mortuorum.


   7. What things were gain to me He says, that those things were gain to
   him, for ignorance of Christ is the sole reason why we are puffed up
   with a vain confidence. Hence, where we see a false estimate of one's
   own excellence, where we see arrogance, where we see pride, there let
   us be assured that Christ is not known. On the other hand, so soon as
   Christ shines forth all those things that formerly dazzled our eyes
   with a false splendor instantly vanish, or at least are disesteemed.
   Those things, accordingly, which had been gain to Paul when he was as
   yet blind, or rather had imposed upon him under an appearance of gain,
   he acknowledges to have been loss to him, when he has been enlightened.
   Why loss? Because they were hinderances in the way of his coming to
   Christ. What is more hurtful than anything that keeps us back from
   drawing near to Christ? Now he speaks chiefly of his own righteousness,
   for we are not received by Christ, except as naked and emptied of our
   own righteousness. Paul, accordingly, acknowledges that nothing was so
   injurious to him as his own righteousness, inasmuch as he was by means
   of it shut out from Christ.

   8. Nay more, I reckon. He means, that he continues to be of the same
   mind, because it often happens, that, transported with delight in new
   things, we forget everything else, and afterwards we regret it. Hence
   Paul, having said that he renounced all hinderances, that he might gain
   Christ, now adds, that he continues to be of this mind.

   For the sake of the excellency of the knowledge He extols the gospel in
   opposition to all such notions as tend to beguile us. For there are
   many things that have an appearance of excellence, but the knowledge of
   Christ surpasses to such a degree everything else by its sublimity
   [183] , that, as compared with it, there is nothing that is not
   contemptible. Let us, therefore, learn from this, what value we ought
   to set upon the knowledge of Christ alone. As to his calling him his
   Lord, he does this to express the intensity of his feeling.

   For whom I have suffered the loss of all things He expresses more than
   he had done previously; at least he expresses himself with greater
   distinctness. It is a similitude taken from seamen, who, when urged on
   by danger of shipwreck, throw everything overboard, that, the ship
   being lightened, they may reach the harbour in safety. Paul, then, was
   prepared to lose everything that he had, rather than be deprived of
   Christ.

   But it is asked, whether it is necessary for us to renounce riches, and
   honors, and nobility of descent, and even external righteousness, that
   we may become partakers of Christ, (Hebrews 3:14,) for all these things
   are gifts of God, which, in themselves, are not to be despised? I
   answer, that the Apostle does not speak here so much of the things
   themselves, as of the quality of them. It is, indeed, true, that the
   kingdom of heaven is like a precious pearl, for the purchase of which
   no one should hesitate to sell everything that he has (Matthew 13:46.)
   There is, however, a difference between the substance of things and the
   quality. Paul did not reckon it necessary to disown connection with his
   own tribe and with the race of Abraham, and make himself an alien, that
   he might become a Christian, but to renounce dependence upon his
   descent. It was not befitting, that from being chaste he should become
   unchaste; that from being sober, he should become intemperate; and that
   from being respectable and honorable, he should become dissolute; but
   that he should divest himself of a false estimate of his own
   righteousness, and treat it with contempt. We, too, when treating of
   the righteousness of faith, do not contend against the substance of
   works, but against that quality with which the sophists invest them,
   inasmuch as they contend that men are justified by them. Paul,
   therefore, divested himself -- not of works, but of that mistaken
   confidence in works, with which he had been puffed up.

   As to riches and honors, when we have divested ourselves of attachment
   to them, we will be prepared, also, to renounce the things themselves,
   whenever the Lord will require this from us, and so it ought to be. It
   is not expressly necessary that you be a poor man, in order that you
   may be Christian; but if it please the Lord that it should be so, you
   ought to be prepared to endure poverty. In fine, it is not lawful for
   Christians to have anything apart from Christ. I consider as apart from
   Christ everything that is a hinderance in the way of Christ alone being
   our ground of glorying, and having an entire sway over us.

   And I count them but refuse. Here he not merely by words, but also by
   realities, amplifies greatly what he had before stated. For those who
   cast their merchandise and other things into the sea, that they may
   escape in safety, do not, therefore, despise riches, but act as persons
   prepared rather to live in misery and want [184] , than to be drowned
   along with their riches. They part with them, indeed, but it is with
   regret and with a sigh; and when they have escaped, they bewail the
   loss of them. Paul, however, declares, on the other hand, that he had
   not merely abandoned everything that he formerly reckoned precious, but
   that they were like dung, offensive to him, or were disesteemed like
   things that are thrown awayin contempt. Chrysostom renders the
   word--straws. Grammarians, however, are of opinion, that skubalon is
   employed as though it were kusibalon -- what is thrown to dogs. [185]
   And certainly there is good reason why everything that is opposed to
   Christ should be offensive to us, inasmuch as it is an abomination in,
   the sight of God. (Luke 16:15.) There is good reason why it should be
   offensive to us also, on the ground of its being an unfounded
   imagination.

   That I may gain Christ. By this expression he intimates that we cannot
   gain Christ otherwise than by losing everything that we have. For he
   would have us rich by his grace alone: he would have him alone be our
   entire blessedness. Now, in what way we must suffer the loss of all
   things, has been already stated -- in such a manner that nothing will
   turn us aside from confidence in Christ alone. But if Paul, with such
   innocence and integrity of life, did not hesitate to reckon his own
   righteousness to be loss and dung, what mean those Pharisees of the
   present day, who, while covered over with every kind of wickedness, do
   nevertheless feel no shame in extolling their own merits in opposition
   to Christ?

   9. And may find them in him The verb is in the passive voice, and hence
   all others have rendered it, I may be found. They pass over the
   context, however, in a very indifferent manner, as though it had no
   peculiar force. If you read it in the passive voice, an antithesis must
   be understood -- thatPaul was lost before he was found in Christ, as a
   rich merchant is like one lost, so long as he has his vessel laden with
   riches; but when they have been thrown overboard, he is found? [186]
   For here that saying [187] is admirably in point -- "I had been lost,
   if I had not been lost." But as the verb euriskomai, while it has a
   passive termination, has an active signification, and means -- to
   recover what you have voluntarily given up, (as Budaeus shews by
   various examples,) I have not hesitated to differ from the opinion of
   others. For, in this way, the meaning will be more complete, and the
   doctrine the more ample -- that Paul renounced everything that he had,
   that he might recover them in Christ; and this corresponds better with
   the word gain, for it means that it was no trivial or ordinary gain,
   inasmuch as Christ contains everything in himself. And, unquestionably,
   we lose nothing when we come to Christ naked and stript of everything,
   for those things which we previously imagined, on false grounds, that
   we possessed, we then begin really to acquire. He, accordingly, shews
   more fully, how great the riches of Christ, because we obtain and find
   all things in him.

   Not having mine own righteousness Here we have a remarkable passage, if
   any one is desirous to have a particular description of the
   righteousness of faith, and to understand its true nature. For Paul
   here makes a comparison between two kinds of righteousness. The one he
   speaks of as belonging to the man, while he calls it at the same time
   the righteousness of the law; the other, he tells us, is from God, is
   obtained through faith, and rests upon faith in Christ. These he
   represents as so directly opposed to each other, that they cannot stand
   together. Hence there are two things that are to be observed here. In
   the first place, that the righteousness of the law must be given up and
   renounced, that you may be righteous through faith; and secondly, that
   the righteousness of faith comes forth from God, and does not belong to
   the individual. As to both of these we have in the present day a great
   controversy with Papists; for on the one hand, they do not allow that
   the righteousness of faith is altogether from God, but ascribe it
   partly to man; and, on the other hand, they mix them together, as if
   the one did not destroy the other. Hence we must carefully examine the
   several words made use of by Paul, for there is not one of them that is
   not very emphatic.

   He says, that believers have no righteousness of their own. Now, it
   cannot be denied, that if there were any righteousness of works, it
   might with propriety be said to be ours. Hence he leaves no room
   whatever for the righteousness of works. Why he calls it the
   righteousness of the law, he shows in Romans 10:5; because this is the
   sentence of the law, He that doeth these things shall live in them. The
   law, therefore, pronounces the man to be righteous through works. Nor
   is there any ground for the cavil of Papists, that all this must be
   restricted to ceremonies. For in the first place, it is a contemptible
   frivolity to affirm that Paul was righteous only through ceremonies;
   and secondly, he in this way draws a contrast between those two kinds
   of righteousness -- the one being of man, the other, from God. He
   intimates, accordingly, that the one is the reward of works, while the
   other is a free gift from God. He thus, in a general way, places man's
   merit in opposition to Christ's grace; for while the law brings works,
   faith presents man before God as naked, that he may be clothed with the
   righteousness of Christ. When, therefore, he declares that the
   righteousness of faith is from God, it is not simply because faith is
   the gift of God, but because God justifies us by his goodness, or
   because we receive by faith the righteousness which he has conferred
   upon us.

   10 That I may know him He points out the efficacy and nature of faith
   -- that it is the knowledge of Christ, and that, too, not bare or
   indistinct, but in such a manner that the power of his resurrection is
   felt. Resurrection he employs as meaning, the completion of redemption,
   so that it comprehends in it at the same time the idea of death. But as
   it is not enough to know Christ as crucified and raised up from the
   dead, unless you experience, also, the fruit of this, he speaks
   expressly of efficacy. [188] Christ therefore is rightly known, when we
   feel how powerful his death and resurrection are, and how efficacious
   they are in us. Now all things are there furnished to us -- expiation
   and destruction of sin, freedom from condemnation, satisfaction,
   victory over death, the attainment of righteousness, and the hope of a
   blessed immortality.

   And the fellowship of his sufferings Having spoken of that
   freely-conferred righteousness, which was procured for us through the
   resurrection of Christ, and is obtained by us through faith, he
   proceeds to treat of the exercises of the pious, and that in order that
   it might not seem as though he introduced an inactive faith, which
   produces no effects in the life. He also intimates, indirectly, that
   these are the exercises in which the Lord would have his people employ
   themselves; while the false Apostles pressed forward upon them the
   useless elements of ceremonies. Let every one, therefore, who has
   become through faith a partaker of all Christ's benefits, acknowledge
   that a condition is presented to him -- that his whole life be
   conformed to his death.

   There is, however, a twofold participation and fellowship in the death
   of Christ. The one is inward -- what the Scripture is wont to term the
   mortification of the flesh, or the crucifixion of the old man, of which
   Paul treats in the sixth chapter of the Romans; the other is outward --
   what is termed the mortification of the outward man. It is the
   endurance of the Cross, of which he treats in the eighth chapter of the
   same Epistle, and here also, if I do not mistake. For after introducing
   along with this the power of his resurrection, Christ crucified is set
   before us, that we may follow him through tribulations and distresses;
   and hence the resurrection of the dead is expressly made mention of,
   that we may know that we must die before we live. This is a continued
   subject of meditation to believers so long as they sojourn in this
   world.

   This, however, is a choice consolation, that in all our miseries we are
   partakers of Christ's Cross, if we are his members; so that through
   afflictions the way is opened up for us to everlasting blessedness, as
   we read elsewhere,

   If we die with him, we shall also live with him; if we suffer with him,
   we shall also reign with him. (2 Timothy 2:11,)

   We must all therefore be prepared for this -- that our whole life shall
   represent nothing else than the image of death, until it produce death
   itself, as the life of Christ is nothing else than a prelude of death.
   We enjoy, however, in the mean time, this consolation -- that the end
   is everlasting blessedness. For the death of Christ is connected with
   the resurrection. Hence Paul says, that he is conformed to his death,
   that he may attain the glory of the resurrection. The phrase, if by any
   means, does not indicate doubt, but expresses difficulty, with a view
   to stimulate our earnest endeavor [189] for it is no light contest,
   inasmuch as we must struggle against so many and so serious
   hinderances.

   Philippians 3:12-17

   12. Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect:
   but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am
   apprehended of Christ Jesus.

   12. Non quod iam apprehenerim, aut iam perfectus sim; sequor autem, si
   ego quoque appreehendam, quemadmodum [190] et apprehensus sum a Christo
   Iesu.

   13. Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one
   thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching
   forth unto those things which are before,

   13. Fratres, ego me ipsum nondum arbitror apprehendisse, unum autem, eq
   que retro sunt oblitus, ad ea quae ante sunt me extendens,

   14. I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in
   Christ Jesus.

   14. Secundum scopum sequor ad palmam supernae vocataionis Dei in
   Christo Iesu

   15. Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in
   any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.

   15. Quicunque perfecti sumus, hoc sentiamus: et si quod aliter
   sentitis, etiam hoc vobis Deus revelabit.

   16. Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the
   same rule, let us mind the same thing.

   16. Caeterum quo perveniamus, ut idem sentiamus, eadem procedamus
   regula.

   17. Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so
   as ye have us for an ensample.

   17. Simul imitatorres mei estote, fratres, et considerate eos qui sic
   ambulant: quemadmodum nos habetis pro exemplari.


   12 Not as though I had already apprehended Paul insists upon this, that
   he may convince the Philippians that he thinks of nothing but Christ --
   knows nothing else -- desires nothing else -- is occupied with no other
   subject of meditation. In connection with this, there is much weight in
   what he now adds -- that he himself, while he had given up all
   hinderances, had nevertheless not attained that object of aim, and
   that, on this account, he always aimed and eagerly aspired at something
   further. How much more was this incumbent on the Philippians, who were
   still far behind him?

   It is asked, however, what it is that Paul says he has not yet
   attained? For unquestionably, so soon as we are by faith ingrafted into
   the body of Christ, we have already entered the kingdom of God, and, as
   it is stated in Ephesians 2:6, we already, in hope, sit in heavenly
   places. I answer, that our salvation, in the mean time, is in hope, so
   that the inheritance indeed is secure; but we nevertheless have it not
   as yet in possession. At the same time, Paul here looks at something
   else -- the advancement of faith, and of that mortification of which he
   had made mention. He had said that he aimed and eagerly aspired at the
   resurrection of the dead through fellowship in the Cross of Christ. He
   adds, that he has not as yet arrived at this. At what? At the
   attainment of having entire fellowship in Christ's sufferings, having a
   full taste of the power of his resurrection, and knowing him perfectly.
   He teaches, therefore, by his own example, that we ought to make
   progress, and that the knowledge of Christ is an attainment of such
   difficulty, that even those who apply themselves exclusively to it, do
   nevertheless not attain perfection in it so long as they live. This,
   however, does not detract in any degree from the authority of Paul's
   doctrine, inasmuch as he had acquired as much as was sufficient for
   discharging the office committed to him. In the mean time, it was
   necessary for him to make progress, that this divinely-furnished
   instructor of all might be trained to humility.

   As also I have been apprehended This clause he has inserted by way of
   correction, that he might ascribe all his endeavors to the grace of
   God. It is not of much importance whether you read as, or in so far as;
   for the meaning in either case remains the same -- that Paul was
   apprehended by Christ, that he might apprehend Christ; that is, that he
   did nothing except under Christ's influence and guidance. I have
   chosen, however, the more distinct rendering, as it seemed to be
   optional.

   13 I reckon not myself to have as yet apprehended He does not here call
   in question the certainty of his salvation, as though he were still in
   suspense, but repeats what he had said before -- that he still aimed at
   making farther progress, because he had not yet attained the end of his
   calling. He shews this immediately after, by saying that he was intent
   on this one thing, leaving off everything else. Now, he compares our
   life to a race-course, the limits of which God has marked out to us for
   running in. For as it would profit the runner nothing to have left the
   starting-point, unless he went forward to the goal, so we must also
   pursue the course of our calling until death, and must not cease until
   we have obtained what we seek. Farther, as the way is marked out to the
   runner, that he may not fatigue himself to no purpose by wandering in
   this direction or in that, so there is also a goal set before us,
   towards which we ought to direct our course undeviatingly; and God does
   not permit us to wander about heedlessly. Thirdly, as the runner
   requires to be free from entanglement, and not stop his course on
   account of any impediment, but must continue his course, surmounting
   every obstacle, so we must take heed that we do not apply our mind or
   heart to anything that may divert the attention, but must, on the
   contrary, make it our endeavor, that, free from every distraction, we
   may apply the whole bent of our mind exclusively to God's calling.
   These three things Paul comprehends in one similitude. When he says
   that he does this one thing, and forgets all things that are behind, he
   intimates his assiduity, and excludes everything fitted to distract.
   When he says that he presses toward the mark, he intimates that he is
   not wandering from the way.

   Forgetting those things that are behind He alludes to runners, who do
   not turn their eyes aside in any direction, lest they should slacken
   the speed of their course, and, more especially, do not look behind to
   see how much ground they have gone over, but hasten forward
   unremittingly towards the goal, Thus Paul teaches us, that he does not
   think of what he has been, or of what he has done, but simply presses
   forward towards the appointed goal, and that, too, with such ardor,
   that he runs forward to it, as it were, with outstretched arms. For a
   metaphor of this nature is implied in the participle which he employs.
   [191]

   Should any one remark, by way of objection, that the remembrance of our
   past life is of use for stirring us up, both because the favors that
   have been already conferred upon us give us encouragement to entertain
   hope, and because we are admonished by our sins to amend our course of
   life, I answer, that thoughts of this nature do not turn away our view
   from what is before us to what is behind, but rather help our vision,
   so that we discern more distinctly the goal. Paul, however, condemns
   here such looking back, as either destroys or impairs alacrity. Thus,
   for example, should any one persuade himself that he has made
   sufficiently great progress, reckoning that he has done enough, he will
   become indolent, and feel inclined to deliver up the lamp [192] to
   others; or, if any one looks back with a feeling of regret for the
   situation that he has abandoned, he cannot apply the whole bent of his
   mind to what he is engaged in. Such was the nature of the thoughts from
   which Paul's mind required to be turned away, if he would in good
   earnest follow out Christ's calling. As, however, there has been
   mention made here of endeavor, aim, course, perseverance, lest any one
   should imagine that salvation consists in these things, or should even
   ascribe to human industry what comes from another quarter, with the
   view of pointing out the cause of all these things, he adds -- in
   Christ Jesus

   15 As many as are perfect Lest any one should understand this as spoken
   of the generality of mankind, as though he were explaining the simple
   elements to those that are mere children in Christ, he declares that it
   is a rule which all that are perfect ought to follow. Now, the rule is
   this -- that we must renounce confidence in all things, that we may
   glory in Christ's righteousness alone, and preferring it to everything
   else, aspire after a participation in his sufferings, which may be the
   means of conducting us to a blessed resurrection. Where now will be
   that state of perfection which monks dream of -- where the confused
   medley of such contrivances -- where, in short, the whole system of
   Popery, which is nothing else than an imaginary perfection, that has
   nothing in common with this rule of Paul? Undoubtedly, whoever will
   understand this single term, will clearly perceive that everything that
   is taught in the Papacy, as to the attainment of righteousness and
   salvation, is nauseous dung.

   If in anything otherwise By the same means he both humbles them, and
   inspires them with good hope, for he admonishes them not to be elated
   in their ignorance, and at the same time he bids them be of good
   courage, when he says that we must wait for the revelation of God. For
   we know how great an obstacle to truth obstinacy is. This, therefore,
   is the best preparation for docility -- when we do not take pleasure in
   error. Paul, accordingly, teaches indirectly, that we must make way for
   the revelation of God, if we have not yet attained what we seek.
   Farther, when he teaches that we must advance by degrees, he encourages
   them not to draw back in the middle of the course. At the same time, he
   maintains beyond all controversy what he has previously taught, when he
   teaches that others who differ from him will have a revelation given to
   them of what they do not as yet know. For it is as though he had said,
   -- "The Lord will one day shew you that the very thing which I have
   stated is a perfect rule of true knowledge and of right living." No one
   could speak in this manner, if he were not fully assured of the
   reasonableness and accuracy of his doctrine. Let us in the mean time
   learn also from this passage, that we must bear for a time with
   ignorance in our weak brethren, and forgive them, if it is not given
   them immediately to be altogether of one mind with us. Paul felt
   assured as to his doctrine, and yet he allows those who could not as
   yet receive it time to make progress, and he does not cease on that
   account to regard them as brethren, only he cautions them against
   flattering themselves in their ignorance. The rendering of the Latin
   copies [193] in the preterite, revelavit, (he has revealed,) I have no
   hesitation in rejecting as unsuitable and inappropriate.

   16 Nevertheless, so far as we have attained Even the Greek manuscripts
   themselves differ as to the dividing of the clauses, for in some of
   them there are two complete sentences. If any one, however, prefer to
   divide the verse, the meaning will be as Erasmus has rendered it. [194]
   For my part, I rather prefer a different reading, implying that Paul
   exhorts the Philipplans to imitate him, that they may at last reach the
   same goal, so as to think the same thing, and walk by the same rule For
   where sincere affection exists, such as reigned in Paul, the way is
   easy to a holy and pious concord, As, therefore, they had not yet
   learned what true perfection was, in order that they might attain it he
   wishes them to be imitators of him; that is, to seek God with a pure
   conscience, (2 Timothy 1:3,) to arrogate nothing to themselves, and
   calmly to subject their understandings to Christ. For in the imitating
   of Paul all these excellences are included -- pure zeal, fear of the
   Lord, modesty, self-renunciation, docility, love, and desire of
   concord. He bids them, however, be at one and the same time imitators
   of him; that is, all with one consent, and with one mind.

   Observe, that the goal of perfection to which he invites the
   Philippians, by his example, is, that they think the same thing, and
   walk by the same rule He has, however, assigned the first place to the
   doctrine in which they ought to harmonize, and the rule to which they
   should conform themselves.

   17 Mark them By this expression he means, that it is all one to him
   what persons they single out for themselves for imitation, provided
   they conform themselves to that purity of which he was a pattern. By
   this means all suspicion of ambition is taken away, for the man that is
   devoted to his own interests wishes to have no rival. At the same time
   he warns them that all are not to be imitated indiscriminately, as he
   afterwards explains more fully.

   Philippians 3:18-21

   18. (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you
   even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:

   18. Multi enim ambulant (quos saepe dicebam vobis, ac nunc etiam flens
   dico, inimicos esse crucis Christi:

   19. Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory
   is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)

   19. Quorum finis perditio, quorum deus venter est, et gloria in
   confusione ipsorum terrena cogitantes.)

   20. For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the
   Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:

   20. Nostra qutem conversatio in coelis est, e quibus etiam salvatorem
   respectamus, Dominum Iesum Christum.

   21. Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto
   his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to
   subdue all things unto himself.

   21. Qui transformabit corpus nostrum humile, ut sit conforme corpori
   suo glorioso, secundum efficaciam, qua potest etiam sibi subiicere
   omnia.


   18 For many walk The simple statement, in my opinion, is this -- Many
   walk who mind earthly things, meaning by this, that there are many who
   creep upon the ground [195] , not feeling the power of God's kingdom.
   He mentions, however, in connection with this, the marks by which such
   persons may be distinguished. These we will examine, each in its order.
   By earthly things some understand ceremonies, and the outward elements
   of the world, which cause true piety to be forgotten, I prefer,
   however, to view the term as referring to carnal affection, as meaning
   that those who are not regenerated by the Spirit of God think of
   nothing but the world. This will appear more distinctly from what
   follows; for he holds them up to odium on this ground -- that, being
   desirous exclusively of their own honor, ease, and gain, they had no
   regard to the edification of the Church.

   Of whom I have told you often He shews that it is not without good
   reason that he has often warned the Philippians, inasmuch as he now
   endeavors to remind them by letter of the same things as he had
   formerly spoken of to them when present with them. His tears, also, are
   an evidence that he is not influenced by envy or hatred of men, nor by
   any disposition to revile, nor by insolence of temper, but by pious
   zeal, inasmuch as he sees that the Church is miserably destroyed [196]
   by such pests. It becomes us, assuredly, to be affected in such a
   manner, that on seeing that the place of pastors is occupied by wicked
   and worthless persons, we shall sigh, and give evidence, at least by
   our tears, that we feel deeply grieved for the calamity of the Church.

   It is of importance, also, to take notice of whom Paul speaks -- not of
   open enemies, who were avowedly desirous that doctrine might be
   undermined -- but of impostors and profligates, who trampled under foot
   the power of the gospel, for the sake of ambition or of their own
   belly. And unquestionably persons of this sort, who weaken the
   influence of the ministry by seeking their own interests, [197]
   sometimes do more injury than if they openly opposed Christ. We must,
   therefore, by no means spare them, but must point them out with the
   finger, as often as there is occasion. Let them complain afterwards, as
   much as they choose, of our severity, provided they do not allege
   anything against us that it is not in our power to justify from Paul's
   example.

   That they are the enemies of the cross of Christ. Some explain cross to
   mean the whole mystery of redemption, and they explain that this is
   said of them, because, by preaching the law, they made void the benefit
   of Christ's death. Others, however, understand it as meaning, that they
   shunned the cross, and were not prepared to expose themselves to
   dangers for the sake of Christ. I understand it, however, in a more
   general way, as meaning that, while they pretended to be friends, they
   were, nevertheless, the worst enemies of the gospel. For it is no
   unusual thing for Paul to employ the term cross to mean the entire
   preaching of the gospel. For as he says elsewhere,

   If any man is in Christ, let him be a new creature.
   (2 Corinthians 5:17.) [198]

   19 Whose end is destruction He adds this in order that the Philippians,
   appalled by the danger, may be so much the more carefully on their
   guard, that they may not involve themselves in the ruin of those
   persons. As, however, profligates of this description, by means of show
   and various artifices, frequently dazzle the eyes of the simple for a
   time, in such a manner that they are preferred even to the most eminent
   servants of Christ, the Apostle declares, with great confidence [199] ,
   that the glory with which they are now puffed up will be exchanged for
   ignominy.

   Whose god is the belly As they pressed the observance of circumcision
   and other ceremonies, he says that they did not do so from zeal for the
   law, but with a view to the favor of men, and that they might live
   peacefully and free from annoyance. For they saw that the Jews burned
   with a fierce rage against Paul, and those like him, and that Christ
   could not be proclaimed by them in purity with any other result, than
   that of arousing against themselves the same rage. Accordingly,
   consulting their own ease and advantage, they mixed up these
   corruptions with the view of mitigating the flames of others. [200]

   20 But our conversation is in heaven This statement overturns all empty
   shows, in which pretended ministers of the gospel are accustomed to
   glory, and he indirectly holds up to odium all their objects of aim,
   [201] because, by flying about above the earth, they do not aspire
   towards heaven. For he teaches that nothing is to be reckoned of any
   value except God's spiritual kingdom, because believers ought to lead a
   heavenly life in this world. "They mind earthly things: it is therefore
   befitting that we, whose conversation is in heaven, should be separated
   from them." [202] We are, it is true, intermingled here with
   unbelievers and hypocrites; nay more, the chaff has more of appearance
   in the granary of the Lord than wheat. Farther, we are exposed to the
   common inconveniences of this earthly life; we require, also, meat and
   drink, and other necessaries, but we must, nevertheless, be conversant
   with heaven in mind and affection. For, on the one hand, we must pass
   quietly through this life, and, on the other hand, we must be dead to
   the world that Christ may live in us, and that we, in our turn, may
   live to him. This passage is a most abundant source of many
   exhortations, which it were easy for any one to elicit from it.

   Whence also. From the connection that we have with Christ, he proves
   that our citizenship [203] is in heaven, for it is not seemly that the
   members should be separated from their Head. Accordingly, as Christ is
   in heaven, in order that we may be conjoined with him, it is necessary
   that we should in spirit dwell apart from this world. Besides,

   where our treasure is, there is our heart also.
   (Matthew 6:21.)

   Christ, who is our blessedness and glory, is in heaven: let our souls,
   therefore, dwell with him on high. On this account he expressly calIs
   him Savior. Whence does salvation come to us? Christ will come to us
   from heaven as a Savior. Hence it were unbefitting that we should be
   taken up with this earth [204] . This epithet, Savior, is suited to the
   connection of the passage; for we are said to be in heaven in respect
   of our minds on this account, that it is from that source alone that
   the hope of salvation beams forth upon us. As the coming of Christ will
   be terrible to the wicked, so it rather turns away their minds from
   heaven than draws them thither: for they know that he will come to them
   as a Judge, and they shun him so far as is in their power. From these
   words of Paul pious minds derive the sweetest consolation, as
   instructing them that the coming of Christ is to be desired by them,
   inasmuch as it will bring salvation to them. On the other hand, it is a
   sure token of incredulity, when persons tremble on any mention being
   made of it. See the eighth chapter of the Romans. While, however,
   others are transported with vain desires, Paul would have believers
   contented with Christ alone.

   Farther, we learn from this passage that nothing mean or earthly is to
   be conceived of as to Christ, inasmuch as Paul bids us look upward to
   heaven, that we may seek him. Now, those that reason with subtlety that
   Christ is not shut up or hid in some corner of heaven, with the view of
   proving that his body is everywhere, and fills heaven and earth, say
   indeed something that is true, but not the whole: for as it were rash
   and foolish to mount up beyond the heavens, and assign to Christ a
   station, or seat, or place of walking, in this or that region, so it is
   a foolish and destructive madness to draw him down from heaven by any
   carnal consideration, so as to seek him upon earth. Up, then, with our
   hearts [205] , that they may be with the Lord.

   21 Who will change By this argument he stirs up the Philippians still
   farther to lift up their minds to heaven, and be wholly attached to
   Christ -- because this body which we carry about with us is not an
   everlasting abode, but a frail tabernacle, which will in a short time
   be reduced to nothing. Besides, it is liable to so many miseries, and
   so many dishonorable infirmities, that it may justly be spoken of as
   vile and full of ignominy. Whence, then, is its restoration to be hoped
   for? From heaven, at Christ's coming. Hence there is no part of us that
   ought not to aspire after heaven with undivided affection. We see, on
   the one hand, in life, but chiefly in death, the present meanness of
   our bodies; the glory which they will have, conformably to Christ's
   body, is incomprehensible by us: for if the disciples could not endure
   the slight taste which he afforded [206] in his transfiguration,
   (Matthew 17:6,) which of us could attain its fullness? Let us for the
   present be contented with the evidence of our adoption, being destined
   to know the riches of our inheritance when we shall come to the
   enjoyment of them.

   According to the efficacy As nothing is more difficult to believe, or
   more at variance with carnal perception, than the resurrection, Paul on
   this account places before our eyes the boundless power of God, that it
   may entirely remove all doubt; for distrust arises from this -- that we
   measure the thing itself by the narrowness of our own understanding.
   Nor does he simply make mention of power, but also of efficacy, which
   is the effect, or power showing itself in action, so to speak. Now,
   when we bear in mind that God, who created all things out of nothing,
   can command the earth, and the sea, and the other elements, to render
   back what has been committed to them [207] , our minds are imrnediately
   roused up to a firm hope -- nay, even to a spiritual contemplation of
   the resurrection.

   But it is of importance to take notice, also, that the right and power
   of raising the dead, nay more, of doing everything according to his own
   pleasure, is assigned to the person of Christ -- an encomium by which
   his Divine majesty is illustriously set forth. Nay, farther, we gather
   from this, that the world was created by him, for to subject all things
   to himself belongs to the Creator alone.

   3. Sane rogo etiam to, germane compar, adiuva eas, quae in evangelio
   idem mecum certamen sustinuerunt, cum Clemente etiam, et reliquis
   adiutoribus meis, quorum nomina sunt in libro vitae.


   1. Therefore, my brethren He concludes his doctrine, as he is wont,
   with most urgent exhortations, that he may fix it the more firmly in
   the minds of men. He also insinuates himself into their affections by
   endearing appellations [208] , which at the same time are not dictated
   by flattery, but by sincere affection. He calls them his joy and crown;
   because, delighted to see those who had been gained over through his
   instrumentality persevering in the faith [209] , he hoped to attain
   that triumph, of which we have spoken [210] , when the Lord will reward
   with a crown those things which have been accomplished under his
   guidance.

   When he bids them so stand fast in the Lord, he means that their
   condition is approved of by him. At the same time, the particle so
   might be taken as referring to the doctrine going before; but the
   former view is more suitable, so that, by praising their present
   condition, he exhorts them to perseverance. They had already, it is
   true, given some evidence of their constancy. Paul, however, well
   knowing human weakness, reckons that they have need of confirmation for
   the future.

   2. I exhort Euodias and Syntyche It is an almost universally received
   opinion that Paul was desirous to settle a quarrel, I know not of what
   sort, between those two women. While I am not inclined to contend as to
   this, the words of Paul do not afford ground enough for such a
   conjecture to satisfy us that it really was so. It appears, from the
   testimony which he gives in their favor, that they were very excellent
   women; for he assigns to them so much honor as to call them
   fellow-soldiers in the gospel [211] . Hence, as their agreement was a
   matter of great moment [212] , and, on the other hand, there would be
   great danger attendant on their disagreement, he stirs them up
   particularly to concord.

   We must take notice, however, that, whenever he speaks of agreement, he
   adds also the bond of it--in the Lord. For every combination will
   inevitably be accursed, if apart from the Lord, and, on the other hand,
   nothing is so disjoined, but that it ought to be reunited in Christ.

   3 I entreat thee, also, true yokefellow I am not inclined to dispute as
   to the gender of the noun, and shall, accordingly, leave it
   undetermined [213] , whether he addresses here a man or a woman. At the
   same time there is excessive weakness in the argument of Erasmus, who
   infers that it is a woman from the circumstance, that mention is made
   here of other women -- as though he did not immediately subjoin the
   name of Clement in the same connection. I refrain, however, from that
   dispute: only I maintain that it is not Paul's wife that is designated
   by this appellation. Those who maintain this, quote Clement and
   Ignatius as their authorities. If they quoted correctly, I would not
   certainly despise men of such eminence. But as writings are brought
   forward from Eusebius [214] which are spurious, and were contrived by
   ignorant monks [215] , they are not deserving of much credit among
   readers of sound judgment [216]

   Let us, therefore, inquire as to the thing itself, without taking any
   false impression from the opinions of men. When Paul wrote the First
   Epistle to the Corinthians, he was, as he mentions, at that time
   unmarried.

   "To the unmarried," says he, "and widows, I say it is good that they
   should continue even as I am" (1 Corinthians 7:8.)

   He wrote that Epistle at Ephesus [217] when he was prepared to leave
   it. Not long after, he proceeded to Jerusalem, where he was put in
   prison, and sent to Rome. Every one must perceive how unsuitable a
   period of time it would have been for marrying a wife, spent by him
   partly in journeying, and partly in prison. In addition to this, he was
   even at that time prepared to endure imprisonment and persecutions, as
   he himself testifies, according to Luke. (Acts 21:13.) I am, at the
   same time, well aware what objection is usually brought forward in
   opposition to this -- that Paul, though married, refrained from
   conjugal intercourse. The words, however, convey another meaning, for
   he is desirous that unmarried persons may have it in their power to
   remain in the same condition with himself. Now, what is that condition
   but celibacy? As to their bringing forward that passage --

   Is it not lawful for me to lead about a wife (I Corinthians 9:5,)

   for the purpose of proving he had a wife, it is too silly to require
   any refutation [218] . But granting that Paul was married, how came his
   wife to be at Philippi -- a city which we do not read of his entering
   on more than two occasions, and in which it is probable he never
   remained so much as two whole months? In fine, nothing is more unlikely
   than that he speaks here of his wife; and to me it does not seem
   probable that he speaks of any female. I leave it, however, to the
   judgment of my readers. The word which Paul makes use of here
   (sullambanesthai) means, to take hold of a thing and embrace it along
   with another person, with the view of giving help [219]

   Whose names are in the book of life The book of life is the roll of the
   righteous, who are predestinated to life, as in the writings of Moses.
   (Exodus 32:32.) God has this roll beside himself in safekeeping. Hence
   the book is nothing else than His eternal counsel, fixed in His own
   breast. In place of this term, Ezekiel employs this expression -- the
   writing of the house of Israel. With the same view it is said in

   Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and let them not be
   written among the righteous; (Psalm 69:28)

   that is, let them not be numbered among the elect of God, whom he
   receives within the limits of his Church and kingdom [220] .

   Should any one allege, that Paul therefore acts rashly in usurping to
   himself the right of pronouncing as to the secrets of God, I answer,
   that we may in some measure form a judgment from the token by which God
   manifests his election, but only in so far as our capacity admits. In
   all those, therefore, in whom we see the marks of adoption shine forth,
   let us in the mean time reckon those to be the sons of God until the
   books are opened, (Revelation 20:12,) which will thoroughly bring all
   things to view. It belongs, it is true, to God alone now to know them
   that are his, (2 Timothy 2:19,) and to separate at least the lambs from
   the kids; [221] but it is our part to reckon in charity all to be lambs
   who, in a spirit of obedience, submit themselves to Christ as their
   Shepherd [222] , who betake themselves to his fold, and remain there
   constantly. It is our part to set so high a value upon the gifts of the
   Holy Spirit, which he confers peculiarly on his elect, that they shall
   be to us the seals, as it were, of an election which is hid from us.

   Philippians 4:4-9

   4. Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.

   4. Gaudete in Domino semper, iterum dico, gaudete.

   5. Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.

   5. Moderatio vestra nota sit omnibus hominibus. Dominus prope est.

   6. Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and
   supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto
   God.

   6. De nulla re sitis solliciti: sed in omnibus, oratione et precatione,
   cum gratiarum actione, petitiones vestrae innotescant apud Deum.

   7. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep
   your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.

   7. Et pax Dei, quae exsuperat omnem intelligentiam, custodiet corda
   vestra et cogitationes vestras in Christo Iesu.

   8. Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are
   honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure,
   whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if
   there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things

   8. Quod reliquum est, fratres, quaecunque sunt vera, quaecunque gravia,
   qaecunque iusta, quaecunque pura, quaecunque amabilia, quaecunque
   honesta: si qua virtus, et qua laus, haec cogitate.

   9. Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard,
   and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.

   9. Quae et didicistis, et suscepistis, et audistis, et vidistis in me:
   haec facite, et Deus pacis erit vobiscum.


   4. Rejoice in the Lord It is an exhortation suited to the times; for,
   as the condition of the pious was exceedingly troublous, and dangers
   threatened them on every side, it was possible that they might give
   way, overcome by grief or impatience. [223] Hence he enjoins it upon
   them, that, amidst circumstances of hostility and disturbance, they
   should nevertheless rejoice in the Lord, [224] as assuredly these
   spiritual consolations, by means of which the Lord refreshes and
   gladdens us, ought then most of all to show their efficacy when the
   whole world tempts us to despair. Let us, however, in connection with
   the circumstances of the times, consider what efficacy there must have
   been in this word uttered by the mouth of Paul, who might have had
   special occasion of sorrow. [225] For if they are appalled by
   persecutions, or imprisonments, or exile, or death, here is the Apostle
   setting himself forward, who, amidst imprisonments, in the very heat of
   persecution, and in fine, amidst apprehensions of death, is not merely
   himself joyful, but even stirs up others to joy. The sum, then, is this
   -- that come what may, believers, having the Lord standing on their
   side [226] , have amply sufficient ground of joy.

   The repetition of the exhortation serves to give greater force to it:
   Let this be your strength and stability, to rejoice in the Lord, and
   that, too, not for a moment merely, but so that your joy in him may be
   perpetuated. [227] For unquestionably it differs from the joy of the
   world in this respect -- that we know from experience that the joy of
   the world is deceptive, frail, and fading, and Christ even pronouces it
   to be accursed (Luke 6:25). Hence, that only is a settled joy in God
   which is such as is never taken away from us.

   5 Your moderation This may be explained in two ways. We may understand
   him as bidding them rather give up their right, than that any one
   should have occasion to complain of their sharpness or severity. "Let
   all that have to deal with you have experience of your equity and
   humanity." In this way to know, will mean to experience. Or we may
   understand him as exhorting them to endure all things with equanimity.
   [228] This latter meaning I rather prefer; for is a term that is made
   use of by the Greeks themselves to denote moderation of spirit -- when
   we are not easily moved by injuries, when we are not easily annoyed by
   adversity, but retain equanimity of temper. In accordance with this,
   Cicero makes use of the following expression, -- "My mind is tranquil,
   which takes everything in good part." [229] Such equanimity -- which is
   as it were the mother of patience -- he requires here on the part of
   the Philippians, and, indeed, such as will manifest itself to all,
   according as occasion will require, by producing its proper effects.
   The term modesty does not seem appropriate here, because Paul is not in
   this passage cautioning them against haughty insolence, but directs
   them to conduct themselves peaceably in everything, and exercise
   control over themselves, even in the endurance of injuries or
   inconveniences.

   The Lord is at hand Here we have an anticipation, by which he obviates
   an objection that might be brought forward. For carnal sense rises in
   opposition to the foregoing statement. For as the rage of the wicked is
   the more inflamed in proportion to our mildness, [230] and the more
   they see us prepared for enduring, are the more emboldened to inflict
   injuries, we are with difficulty induced to possess our souls in
   patience. (Luke 21:19.) Hence those proverbs, -- "We must howl when
   among wolves." "Those who act like sheep will quickly be devoured by
   wolves." Hence we conclude, that the ferocity of the wicked must be
   repressed by corresponding violence, that they may not insult us with
   impunity. [231] To such considerations Paul here opposes confidence in
   Divine providence. He replies, I say, that the Lord is at hand, whose
   power can overcome their audacity, and whose goodness can conquer their
   malice. He promises that he will aid us, provided we obey his
   commandment. Now, who would not rather be protected by the hand of God
   alone, than have all the resources of the world at his command?

   Here we have a most beautiful sentiment, from which we learn, in the
   first place, that ignorance of the providence of God is the cause of
   all impatience, and that this is the reason why we are so quickly, and
   on trivial accounts, thrown into confusion, [232] and often, too,
   become disheartened because we do not recognize the fact that the Lord
   cares for us. On the other hand, we learn that this is the only remedy
   for tranquillizing our minds -- when we repose unreservedly in his
   providential care, as knowing that we are not exposed either to the
   rashness of fortune, or to the caprice of the wicked, [233] but are
   under the regulation of God's fatherly care. In fine, the man that is
   in possession of this truth, that God is present with him, has what he
   may rest upon with security.

   There are, however, two ways in which the Lord is said to be at hand --
   either because his judgment is at hand, or because he is prepared to
   give help to his own people, in which sense it is made use of here; and
   also in Psalm 145:18, The Lord is near to all that call upon him. The
   meaning therefore is, -- "Miserable were the condition of the pious, if
   the Lord were at a distance from them." But as he has received them
   under his protection and guardianship, and defends them by his hand,
   which is everywhere present, let them rest upon this consideration,
   that they may not be intimidated by the rage of the wicked. It is well
   known, and matter of common occurrence, that the term solicitudo
   (carefulness) is employed to denote that anxiety which proceeds from
   distrust of Divine power or help.

   6 But in all things It is the singular number that is made use of by
   Paul, but is the neuter gender; the expression, therefore, is
   equivalent to omni negotio, (in every matter,) for (prayer) and
   (supplication) are feminine nouns. In these words he exhorts the
   Philippians, as David does all the pious in Psalm 55:22, and Peter also
   in 1 Peter 5:7, to cast all their care upon the Lord. For we are not
   made of iron, [234] so as not to be shaken by temptations. But this is
   our consolation, this is our solace -- to deposit, or (to speak with
   greater propriety) to disburden in the bosom of God everything that
   harasses us. Confidence, it is true, brings tranquillity to our minds,
   but it is only in the event of our exercising ourselves in prayers.
   Whenever, therefore, we are assailed by any temptation, let us betake
   ourselves forthwith to prayer, as to a sacred asylum. [235]

   The term requests he employs here to denote desires or wishes. He would
   have us make these known to God by prayer and supplication, as though
   believers poured forth their hearts before God, when they commit
   themselves, and all that they have, to Him. Those, indeed, who look
   hither and thither to the vain comforts of the world, may appear to be
   in some degree relieved; but there is one sure refuge -- leaning upon
   the Lord.

   With thanksgiving As many often pray to God amiss, [236] full of
   complaints or of murmurings, as though they had just ground for
   accusing him, while others cannot brook delay, if he does not
   immediately gratify their desires, Paul on this account conjoins
   thanksgiving with prayers. It is as though he had said, that those
   things which are necessary for us ought to be desired by us from the
   Lord in such a way, that we, nevertheless, subject our affections to
   his good pleasure, and give thanks while presenting petitions. And,
   unquestionably, gratitude [237] will have this effect upon us -- that
   the will of God will be the grand sum of our desires.

   7. And the peace of God Some, by turning the future tense into the
   optative mood, convert this statement into a prayer, but it is without
   proper foundation. For it is a promise in which he points out the
   advantage of a firm confidence in God, and invocation of him. "If you
   do that," says he, "the peace of God will keep your minds and hearts."
   Scripture is accustomed to divide the soul of man, as to its frailties,
   into two parts -- the mind and the heart. The mind means the
   understanding, while the heart denotes all the disposition or
   inclinations. These two terms, therefore, include the entire soul, in
   this sense, -- "The peace of God will guard you, so as to prevent you
   from turning back from God in wicked thoughts or desires."

   It is on good ground that he calls it the peace of God, inasmuch as it
   does not depend on the present aspect of things, [238] and does not
   bend itself to the various shiftings of the world, [239] but is founded
   on the firm and immutable word of God. It is on good grounds, also,
   that he speaks of it as surpassing all understanding or perception, for
   nothing is more foreign to the human mind, than in the depth of despair
   to exercise, nevertheless, a feeling of hope, in the depth of poverty
   to see opulence, and in the depth of weakness to keep from giving way,
   and, in fine, to promise ourselves that nothing will be wanting to us
   when we are left destitute of all things; and all this in the grace of
   God alone, which is not itself known otherwise than through the word,
   and the inward earnest of the Spirit.

   8. Finally What follows consists of general exhortations which relate
   to the whole of life. In the first place, he commends truth, which is
   nothing else than the integrity of a good conscience, with the fruits
   of it: secondly, gravity, or sanctity, for to semnon [240] denotes both
   -- an excellence which consists in this, that we walk in a manner
   worthy of our vocation, (Ephesians 4:1,) keeping at a distance from all
   profane filthiness: thirdly, justice, which has to do with the mutual
   intercourse of mankind -- that we do not injure any one, that we do not
   defraud any one; and, fourthly, purity, which denotes chastity in every
   department of life. Paul, however, does not reckon all these things to
   be sufficient, if we do not at the same time endeavor to make ourselves
   agreeable to all, in so far as we may lawfully do so in the Lord, and
   have regard also to our good name. For it is in this way that I
   understand the words --

   If any praise, [241] that is, anything praiseworthy, for amidst such a
   corruption of manners there is so great a perversity in men's judgments
   that praise is often bestowed [242] upon what is blameworthy, and it is
   not allowable for Christians to be desirous even of true praise among
   men, inasmuch as they are elsewhere forbidden to glory, except in God
   alone. (1 Corinthians 1:31.) Paul, therefore, does not bid them try to
   gain applause or commendation by virtuous actions, nor even to regulate
   their life according to the judgments of the people, but simply means,
   that they should devote themselves to the performance of good works,
   which merit commendation, that the wicked, and those who are enemies of
   the gospel, while they deride Christians and cast reproach upon them,
   may, nevertheless, be constrained to commend their deportment.

   The word, prosphilo kai euphema however, among the Greeks, is employed,
   like cogitare among the Latins, to mean, meditate. [243] Now meditation
   comes first, afterwards follows action.

   9. What things ye have learned, and received, and heard By this
   accumulation of terms he intimates, that he was assiduous in
   inculcating these things. "This was my doctrine -- my instruction -- my
   discourse among you." Hypocrites, on the other hand, insisted upon
   nothing but ceremonies. Now, it was a dishonorable thing to abandon the
   holy instruction, [244] which they had wholly imbibed, and with which
   they had been thorouglly imbued.

   You have seen in me Now, the main thing in a public speaker [245]
   should be, that he may speak, not with his mouth merely, but by his
   life, and procure authority for his doctrine by rectitude of life.
   Paul, accordingly, procures authority for his exhortation on this
   ground, that he had, by his life no less than by his mouth, been a
   leader and master of virtues.

   And the God of peace He had spoken of the peace of God; he now more
   particularly confirms what he had said, by promising that God himself,
   the Author of peace, will be with them. For the presence of God brings
   us every kind of blessing: as though he had said, that they would feel
   that God was present with them to make all things turn out well and
   prosperously, provided they apply themselves to pious and holy actions.

   Philippians 4:10-14

   10. But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care
   of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye

   10 But I rejoiced He now declares the gratitude of his mind towards the
   Philippians, that they may not regret their beneficence, [246] as is
   usually the case when we think that our services are despised, or are
   reckoned of no account. They had sent him by Epaphroditus supplies for
   the relief of his necessity; he declares that their present had been
   acceptable to him, and he says, that he rejoiced that they had plucked
   up new vigor so as to exercise care respecting him. The metaphor is
   borrowed from trees, the strength of which is drawn inward, and lies
   concealed during winter, and begins to flourish [247] in spring. But
   immediately afterwards subjoining a correction, he qualifies what he
   had said, that he may not seem to reprove their negligence in the past.
   He says, therefore, that they had formerly, too, been concerned
   respecting him, but that the circumstances of the times had not
   admitted of his being sooner relieved by their benignity. Thus he
   throws the blame upon the want of opportunity. I take the phrase eph'
   ho' as referring to the person of Paul, and that is its proper
   signification, as well as more in accordance with the connection of
   Paul's words.

   11 Not that I speak with respect to want Here we have a second
   correction, by which he guards against its being suspected that his
   spirit was pusillanimous and broken down by adversities. For it was of
   importance that his constancy and moderation should be known by the
   Philippians, to whom he was a pattern of life. Accordingly he declares,
   that he had been gratified by their liberality in such a way that he
   could at the same time endure want with patience. Want refers here to
   disposition, for that man can never be poor in mind, who is satisfied
   with the lot which has been assigned to him by God.

   In what state I am, says he, that is, "Whatever my condition may be, I
   am satisfied with it." Why? because saints know that they thus please
   God. Hence they do not measure sufficiency by abundance, but by the
   will of God, which they judge of by what takes place, for they are
   persuaded that their affairs are regulated by his providence and good
   pleasure.

   12 I know both how to be abased There follows here a distinction, with
   the view of intimating that he has a mind adapted to bear any kind of
   condition. [248] Prosperity is wont to puff up the mind beyond measure,
   and adversity, on the other hand, to depress. From both faults he
   declares himself to be free. I know, says he, to be abased -- that is,
   to endure abasement with patience. Perisseuein is made use of twice,
   but in the former instance it is employed as meaning, to excel; in the
   second instance as meaning, to abound, so as to correspond with the
   things to which they are exposed. If a man knows to make use of present
   abundance in a sober and temperate manner, with thanksgiving, prepared
   to part with everything whenever it may be the good pleasure of the
   Lord, giving also a share to his brother, according to the measure of
   his ability, and is also not puffed up, that man has learned to excel,
   and to abound. This is a peculiarly excellent and rare virtue, and much
   superior to the endurance of poverty. Let all who wish to be Christ's
   disciples exercise themselves in acquiring this knowledge which was
   possessed by Paul, but in the mean time let them accustom themselves to
   the endurance of poverty in such a manner that it will not be grievous
   and burdensome to them when they come to be deprived of their riches.

   13 I can do all things through Christ As he had boasted of things that
   were very great, [249] in order that this might not be attributed to
   pride or furnish others with occasion of foolish boasting, he adds,
   that it is by Christ that he is endowed with this fortitude. "I can do
   all things," says he, "but it is in Christ, not by my own power, for it
   is Christ that supplies me with strength." Hence we infer, that Christ
   will not be less strong and invincible in us also, if, conscious of our
   own weakness, we place reliance upon his power alone. When he says all
   things, he means merely those things which belong to his calling.

   14 Nevertheless ye did well How prudently and cautiously he acts,
   looking round carefully in both directions, that he may not lean too
   much to the one side or to the other. By proclaiming in magnificent
   terms his steadfastness, he meant to provide against the Philippians
   supposing that he had given way under the pressure of want. [250] He
   now takes care that it may not, from his speaking in high terms, appear
   as though he despised their kindness -- a thing that would not merely
   shew cruelty and obstinacy, but also haughtiness. He at the same time
   provides for this, that if any other of the servants of Christ should
   stand in need of their assistance they may not be slow to give him
   help.

   Philippians 4:15-23

   15. Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel,
   when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as
   concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.

   15. Nostis autem et vos Philippenses, quod initio Evangelii, qunado
   exivi ex Macedonia, nulla mecum Ecclesia in ratione dati et accepti,
   nisi vos soli.

   16. For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.

   16. Nam et Tessalonicam semel atque iterum mihi, quod opus erat,
   misistis:

   17. Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to
   your account.

   17. Non quia requiram donum, sed requiro fructum, qui exsuperet in
   rationem vestram.

   18. But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of
   Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet
   smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.

   18. Accepi autem omnia et abundo, impletus sum, postquam ab Epaphrodito
   accepi, quai missa sunt a vobis in odorem bonae fragrantiae,
   sacrificium acceptum gractum Deo.

   It was written to the Philippians from Rome by Epaphroditus.

   Scripta est a roma per Epaphroditum.


   15 And ye know I understand this to have been added by way of excuse,
   inasmuch as he often received something from them, for if the other
   Churches had discharged their duty, it might have seemed as though he
   were too eager to receive. Hence in clearing himself he praises them,
   and in praising them he modestly excuses others. We must also, after
   Paul's example, take heed lest the pious, on seeing us too much
   inclined to receive from others, should on good grounds reckon us to be
   insatiable. You also know, says he. "I do not require to call in other
   witnesses, for ye yourselves also know." For it frequently happens,
   that when one thinks that others are deficient in duty, he is the more
   liberal in giving assistance. Thus the liberality of some escapes the
   notice of others.

   In the matter of giving and receiving He alludes to pecuniary matters,
   in which there are two parts, the one receiving, the other expending.
   It is necessary that these should be brought to an equality by mutual
   compensation. There was an account of this nature carried on between
   Paul and the Churches. [251] While Paul administered the gospel to
   them, there was an obligation devolving upon them in return for
   supplying what was necessary for the support of his life, as he says
   elsewhere,

   If we dispense to you spiritual thinqs, is it a great matter if you
   give in return carnal things? (1 Corinthians 9:11.)

   Hence, if the other churches had relieved Paul's necessities, they
   would have been giving nothing gratuitously, but would have been simply
   paying their debt, for they ought to have acknowledged themselves
   indebted to him for the gospel. This, however, he acknowledges, had not
   been the case, inasmuch as they had not laid out anything on his
   account. What base ingratitude, and how very unseemly, to treat such an
   Apostle with neglect, to whom they knew themselves to be under
   obligation beyond their power to discharge! On the other hand, how
   great the forbearance of this holy man, to bear with their inhumanity
   with so much gentleness and indulgence, as not to make use of one sharp
   word by way of accusing them!

   17. Not that I demand a gift. Again he repels an unfavourable opinion
   that might be formed of immoderate cupidity, that they might not
   suppose that it was an indirect hint, [252] as if they ought singly to
   stand in the room of all, [253] and as if he abused their kindness. He
   accordingly declares, that he consulted not so much his own advantage
   as theirs. "While I receive from you," says he, "there is
   proportionably much advantage that redounds to yourselves; for there
   are just so many articles that you may reckon to have been transferred
   to the table of accounts." The meaning of this word [254] is connected
   with the similitude formerly employed of exchange or compensation in
   pecuniary matters.

   18 I have received all things, and abound He declares in more explicit
   terms, that he has what is sufficient, and honors their liberality with
   a remarkable testimony, by saying, that he has been filled. It was
   undoubtedly a moderate sum that they had sent, but he says, that by
   means of that moderate sum he is filled to satiety. It is, however, a
   more distinguished commendation that he bestows upon the gift in what
   follows, when he calls it a sacrifice acceptable, and presented as the
   odour of a good fragrance For what better thing can be desired than
   that our acts of kindness should be sacred offerings, which God
   receives from our hands, and takes pleasure in their sweet odour? For
   the same reason Christ says, Whatsoever ye shall have done unto one of
   the least of these, ye have done it unto me.

   The similitude of sacrifices, however, adds much emphasis, by which we
   are taught, that the exercise of love which God enjoins upon us, is not
   merely a benefit conferred upon man, but is also a spiritual and sacred
   service which is performed to God, as we read in the Epistle to the
   Hebrews, that he is well pleased with such sacrifices. (Hebrews 13:16.)
   Alas for our indolence! [255] -- which appears in this, that while God
   invites us with so much kindness to the honor of priesthood, and even
   puts sacrifices in our hands, we nevertheless do not sacrifice to him,
   and those things which were set apart for sacred oblations we not only
   lay out for profane uses, but squander them wickedly upon the most
   polluted contaminations. [256] For the altars, on which sacrifices from
   our resources ought to be presented, are the poor, and the servants of
   Christ. To the neglect of these some squander their resources on every
   kind of luxury, others upon the palate, others upon immodest attire,
   others upon magnificent dwellings. [257]

   19 My God will supply Some read impleat -- in the optative -- May he
   supply. [258] While I do not reject this reading, I approve more of the
   other. He expressly makes mention of God as his, because he owns and
   acknowledges as done to himself whatever kindness is shewn to his
   servants. They had therefore been truly sowing in the Lord's field,
   from which a sure and abundant harvest might be expected. Nor does he
   promise them merely a reward in the future life, but even in respect of
   the necessities of the present life: "Do not think that you have
   impoverished yourselves; God, whom I serve, will abundantly furnish you
   with everything necessary for you." The phrase, in glory, ought to be
   taken in place of the adverb gloriously, as meaning magnificently, or
   splendidly. He adds, however, by Christ, in whose name everything that
   we do is acceptable to God.

   20 Now to our God and Father This may be taken as a general
   thanksgiving, by which he closes the epistle; or it may be viewed as
   bearing more particularly upon the last clause in reference to the
   liberality shewn to Paul. [259] For in respect of the assistance which
   the Philippians had afforded him, it became him to reckon himself
   indebted to them for it in such a manner as to acknowledge, that this
   aid had been afforded to them by the mercy of God.

   22 The brethren that are with me salute you In these salutations he
   names first of all his intimate associates, [260] afterwards all the
   saints in general, that is, the whole Church at Rome, but chiefly those
   of the household of Nero -- a thing well deserving to be noticed; for
   it is no common evidence of divine mercy, that the gospel had made its
   way into that sink of all crimes and iniquities. It is also the more to
   be admired, in proportion as it is a rare thing for holiness to reign
   in the courts of sovereigns. The conjecture formed by some, that Seneca
   is here referred to among others, has no appearance of foundation; for
   he never gave any evidence, even the smallest, of his being a
   Christian; nor did he belong to the household of Caesar, but was a
   senator, and had at one time held the office of praetor. [261]

   THE ARGUMENT

   ON THE EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS.

   There were three neighboring cities in Phrygia, as made mention of by
   Paul in this Epistle -- Laodicea, Hierapolis, and Colosse which, as
   Orosius [262] informs us, were overthrown [263] by an earthquake in the
   times of the emperor Nero. Accordingly, not long after this Epistle was
   written, three Churches of great renown perished by a mournful as well
   as horrible occurrence -- a bright mirror truly of divine judgment, if
   we had but eyes to see it. The Colossians had been, not indeed by Paul,
   but with fidelity and purity by Epaphras and other ministers,
   instructed in the gospel; but immediately afterwards, Satan had, with
   his tares, crept in, (Matthew 13:25,) [264] according to his usual and
   invariable manner, that he might there pervert the right faith. [265]

   Some are of opinion that there were two classes of men that endeavored
   to draw aside the Colossians from the purity of the gospel; -- that, on
   the one hand, the philosophers, by disputing in reference to stars,
   fate, and trifles of a like nature, and that the Jews, on the other
   hand, by urging the observance of their ceremonies, had raised up many
   mists with the view of throwing Christ into the shade. [266] Those,
   however, who are of this opinion are influenced by a conjecture of
   exceedingly little weight -- on the ground that PAUL makes mention of
   thrones, and powers, and heavenly creatures. For as to their adding
   also the term elements, [267] it is worse than ridiculous. As, however,
   it is not my intention to refute the opinions of others, I shall simply
   state what appears to me to be the truth, and what may be inferred by
   sound reasoning.

   In the first place, it is abundantly evident, from Paul's words, that
   those profligates were intent upon this -- that they might mix up
   Christ with Moses, and might retain the shadows of the law along with
   the gospel. Hence it is probable that they were Jews. As, however, they
   coloured over their fallacies with specious disguises, [268] Paul, on
   this account, calls it a vain philosophy. (Colossians 2:8) At the same
   time, in employing that term, he had in his eye, in my opinion, the
   speculations with which they amused themselves, which were subtle, it
   is true, but at the same time useless and profane: for they contrived a
   way of access to God through means of angels, and put forth many
   speculations of that nature, such as are contained in the books of
   Dionysius on the Celestial Hierarchy, [269] drawn from the school of
   the Platonists. This, therefore, is the principal object at which he
   aims -- to teach that all things are in Christ, and that he alone ought
   to be reckoned amply sufficient by the Colossians.

   The order, however, which he follows is this: -- After the inscription
   usually employed by him, he commends them, with the view of leading
   them to listen to him more attentively. He then, with the view of
   shutting up the way against all new and strange contrivances, bears
   testimony to the doctrine which they had previously received from
   Epaphras. Afterwards, in entreating that the Lord would increase their
   faith, he intimates that something is still wanting to them, that he
   may pave the way for imparting to them more solid instruction. On the
   other hand, he extols with suitable commendations the grace of God
   towards them, that they may not lightly esteem it. Then follows the
   instruction, in which he teaches that all parts of our salvation are to
   be found in Christ alone, that they may not seek anything elsewhere;
   and he puts them in mind that it was in Christ that they had obtained
   every blessing that they possessed, in order that they might the more
   carefully make it their aim to retain him to the end. [270] And, truly,
   even this one article were of itself perfectly sufficient to lead us to
   reckon this Epistle, short as it is, to be an inestimable treasure; for
   what is of greater importance in the whole system of heavenly doctrine
   than to have Christ drawn to the life, that we may distinctly behold
   [271] his excellence, his office, and all the fruits that arise to us
   from it.

   For in this respect especially we differ from Papists, that while we
   are both of us called Christians, and profess to believe in Christ,
   they picture to themselves one that is torn, disfigured, divested of
   his excellence, denuded of his office, in fine, such as to be a spectre
   [272] rather than Christ himself: we, on the other hand, embrace him
   such as he is here described by Paul -- loving and efficacious. This
   Epistle, therefore, to express it in one word, distinguishes the true
   Christ from a fictitious one [273] -- than which nothing better or more
   excellent can be desired. Towards the end of the First Chapter he again
   endeavors to secure authority for himself from the station assigned
   him, [274] and in magnificent terms extols the dignity of the gospel.

   In the Second Chapter he opens up more distinctly than he had done the
   reason which had induced him to write -- that he might provide against
   the danger which he saw to be impending over them, while he touches, in
   passing, on the affection which he cherishes towards them, that they
   may know that their welfare is the object of his concern. From this he
   proceeds to exhortation, by which he applies the foregoing doctrine, as
   it were, to present use; [275] for he bids them rest in Christ alone,
   and brands as vanity everything that is apart from Christ. [276] He
   speaks particularly of circumcision, abstinence from food, and of other
   outward exercises -- in which they mistakingly made the service of God
   to consist; and also of the absurd worship of angels, whom they put in
   Christ's room. Having made mention of circumcision, he takes occasion
   to notice also, in passing, what is the office, and what is the nature
   of ceremonies -- from which he lays it down as a settled point that
   they have been abrogated by Christ. These things are treated of till
   the end of the Second Chapter.

   In the Third Chapter, in opposition to those vain prescriptions, to the
   observance of which the false apostles were desirous to bind believers,
   he makes mention of those true offices of piety in which the Lord would
   have us employ ourselves; and he begins with the very spring-head --
   that is, mortification of the flesh and newness of life. From this he
   derives the streams -- that is, particular exhortations, some of which
   apply to all Christians alike, while others relate more especially to
   particular individuals, according to the nature of their calling.

   In the beginning of the Fourth Chapter he follows out the same subject:
   afterwards, having commended himself to their prayers, he shews by many
   tokens [277] how much he loves them, and is desirous to promote their
   welfare.

   3. We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
   praying always for you,

   3. Gratias agimus Deo et Patri Domini nostri Iesu Christi, semper pro
   vobis orantes,

   4. Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which
   ye have to all the saints,

   4. Audita fide vestra, quae est in Christo Iesu, et caritate erga omnes
   sanctos,

   5. For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard
   before in the word of the truth of the gospel;

   5. Propter spem repositam vobis in coelis, de qua prius audistis, per
   sermonem veritatis, nempe Evangelii,

   6. Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth
   forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and
   knew the grace of God in truth:

   6. Quod ad vos pervenit: quemadmodum et in universo mundo fructificat
   et propagatur, sicut etiam in vobis, ex quo die audistis, et
   cognovistis gratiam Dei in veritate.

   7. As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for
   you a faithful minister of Christ;

   7. Quemadmodum et didicistis ab Epaphra, dilecto converso nostro, qui
   est fidelis erga vos minister Christi:

   8. Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.

   8. Qui etiam nobis manifestavit caritatem vestram in Spiritu.


   1 Paul an Apostle. I have already, in repeated instances, explained the
   design of such inscriptions. As, however, the Colossians had never seen
   him, and on that account his authority was not as yet so firmly
   established among them as to make his private name [278] by itself
   sufficient, he premises that he is an Apostle of Christ set apart by
   the will of God. From this it followed, that he did not act rashly in
   writing to persons that were not known by him, inasmuch as he was
   discharging an embassy with which God had intrusted him. For he was not
   bound to one Church merely, but his Apostleship extended to all. The
   term saints which he applies to them is more honorable, but in calling
   them faithful brethren, he allures them more willingly to listen to
   him. As for other things, they may be found explained in the foregoing
   Epistles.

   3. We give thanks to God. He praises the faith and love of the
   Colossians, that it may encourage them the more to alacrity and
   constancy of perseverance. Farther, by shewing that he has a persuasion
   of this kind respecting them, he procures their friendly regards, that
   they may be the more favourably inclined and teachable for receiving
   his doctrine. We must always take notice that he makes use of
   thanksgiving in place of congratulation, by which he teaches us, that
   in all our joys we must readily call to remembrance the goodness of
   God, inasmuch as everything that is pleasant and agreeable to us is a
   kindness conferred by him. Besides, he admonishes us, by his example,
   to acknowledge with gratitude not merely those things which the Lord
   confers upon us, but also those things which he confers upon others.

   But for what things does he give thanks to the Lord? For the faith and
   love of the Colossians. He acknowledges, therefore, that both are
   conferred by God: otherwise the gratitude were pretended. And what have
   we otherwise than through his liberality? If, however, even the
   smallest favors come to us from that source, how much more ought this
   same acknowledgment to be made in reference to those two gifts, in
   which the entire sum of our excellence consists?

   To the God and Father. [279] Understand the expression thus -- To God
   who is the Father of Christ. For it is not lawful for us to acknowledge
   any other God than him who has manifested himself to us in his Son. And
   this is the only key for opening the door to us, if we are desirous to
   have access to the true God. For on this account, also, is he a Father
   to us, because he has embraced us in his only begotten Son, and in him
   also sets forth his paternal favor for our contemplation.

   Always for you, Some explain it thus -- We give thanks to God always
   for you, that is, continually. Others explain it to mean -- Praying
   always for you. It may also be interpreted in this way, "Whenever we
   pray for you, we at the same time give thanks to God;" and this is the
   simple meaning, "We give thanks to God, and we at the same time pray."
   By this he intimates, that the condition of believers is never in this
   world perfect, so as not to have, invariably, something wanting. For
   even the man who has begun admirably well, may fall short in a hundred
   instances every day; and we must ever be making progress while we are
   as yet on the way. Let us therefore bear in mind that we must rejoice
   in the favors that we have already received, and give thanks to God for
   them in such a manner, as to seek at the same time from him
   perseverance and advancement.

   4. Having heard of your faith. This was a means of stirring up his love
   towards them, and his concern for their welfare, when he heard it that
   they were distinguished by faith and love. And, unquestionably, gifts
   of God that are so excellent ought to have such an effect upon us as to
   stir us up to love them wherever they appear. He uses the expression,
   faith in Christ, that we may always bear in mind that Christ is the
   proper object of faith.

   He employs the expression, love towards the saints, not with the view
   of excluding others, but because, in proportion as any one is joined to
   us in God, we ought to embrace him the more closely with special
   affection. True love, therefore, will extend to mankind universally,
   because they all are our flesh, and created in the image of God,
   (Genesis 9:6;) but in respect of degrees, it will begin with those who
   are of the household of faith. (Galatians 6:10.)

   5. For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven. For the hope of
   eternal life will never be inactive in us, so as not to produce love in
   us. For it is of necessity, that the man who is fully persuaded that a
   treasure of life is laid up for him in heaven will aspire thither,
   looking down upon this world. Meditation, however, upon the heavenly
   life stirs up our affections both to the worship of God, and to
   exercises of love. The Sophists pervert this passage for the purpose of
   extolling the merits of works, as if the hope of salvation depended on
   works. The reasoning, however, is futile. For it does not follow, that
   because hope stimulates us to aim at upright living, it is therefore
   founded upon works, inasmuch as nothing is more efficacious for this
   purpose than God's unmerited goodness, which utterly overthrows all
   confidence in works.

   There is, however, an instance of metonymy in the use of the term hope,
   as it is taken for the thing hoped for. For the hope that is in our
   hearts is the glory which we hope for in heaven. At the same time, when
   he says, that there is a hope that is laid up for us in heaven, he
   means, that believers ought to feel assured as to the promise of
   eternal felicity, equally as though they had already a treasure laid up
   [280] in a particular place.

   Of which ye heard before. As eternal salvation is a thing that
   surpasses the comprehension of our understanding, he therefore adds,
   that the assurance of it had been brought to the Colossians by means of
   the gospel; and at the same time he says in the outset, [281] that he
   is not to bring forward anything new, but that he has merely in view to
   confirm them in the doctrine which they had previously received.
   Erasmus has rendered -- it the true word of the gospel. I am also well
   aware that, according to the Hebrew idiom, the genitive is often made
   use of by Paul in place of an epithet; but the words of Paul here are
   more emphatic. [282] For he calls the gospel, kaps exochen, (by way of
   eminence,) the word of truth, with the view of putting honor upon it,
   that they may more steadfastly and firmly adhere to the revelation
   which they have derived from that source. Thus the term gospel is
   introduced by way of apposition [283]

   6 As also in all the world it brings forth fruit. This has a tendency
   both to confirm and to comfort the pious -- to see the effect of the
   gospel far and wide in gathering many to Christ. The faith of it does
   not, it is true, depend on its success, as though we should believe it
   on the ground that many believe it. Though the whole world should fail,
   though heaven itself should fall, the conscience of a pious man must
   not waver, because God, on whom it is founded, does nevertheless remain
   true. This, however, does not hinder our faith from being confirmed,
   whenever it perceives God's excellence, which undoubtedly shews itself
   with more power in proportion to the number of persons that are gained
   over to Christ.

   In addition to this, in the multitude of the believers at that time
   there was beheld an accomplishment of the many predictions which extend
   the reign of Christ from the East to the West. Is it a trivial or
   common aid to faith, to see accomplished before our eyes what the
   Prophets long since predicted as to the extending of the kingdom of
   Christ through all countries of the world? What I speak of, there is no
   believer that does not experience in himself. Paul accordingly had it
   in view to encourage the Colossians the more by this statement, that,
   by seeing in various places the fruit and progress of the gospel, they
   might embrace it with more eager zeal. Auxanomenon, which I have
   rendered propagatur, (is propagated,) does not occur in some copies;
   but, from its suiting better with the context, I did not choose to omit
   it. It also appears front the commentaries of the ancients that this
   reading was always the more generally received. [284]

   Since the day ye heard it, and knew the grace. Here he praises them on
   account of their docility, inasmuch as they immediately embraced sound
   doctrine; and he praises them on account of their constancy, inasmuch
   as they persevered in it. It is also with propriety that the faith of
   the gospel is called the knowledge of God's grace; for no one has ever
   tasted of the gospel but the man that knew himself to be reconciled to
   God, and took hold of the salvation that is held forth in Christ.

   In truth means truly and without pretense; for as he had previously
   declared that the gospel is undoubted truth, so he now adds, that it
   had been purely administered by them, and that by Epaphras. For while
   all boast that they preach the gospel, and yet at the same time there
   are many evil workers, (Philippians 3:2,) through whose ignorance, or
   ambition, or avarice, its purity is adulterated, it is of great
   importance that faithful ministers should be distinguished from the
   less upright. For it is not enough to hold the term gospel, unless we
   know that this is the true gospel -- what was preached by Paul and
   Epaphras. Hence Paul confirms the doctrine of Epaphras by giving it his
   approbation, that he may induce the Colossians to adhere to it, and
   may, by the same means, call them back from those profligates who
   endeavored to introduce strange doctrines. He at the same time
   dignifies Epaphras with a special distinction, that he may have more
   authority among them; and lastly, he presents him to the Colossians in
   an amiable aspect, by saying that he had borne testimony to him of
   their love. Paul everywhere makes it his particular aim, that he may,
   by his recommendation, render those who he knows serve Christ
   faithfully, very dear to the Churches; as, on the other hand, the
   ministers of Satan are wholly intent on alienating, by unfavourable
   representations, [285] the minds of the simple from faithful pastors.

   Love in the Spirit I take to mean, spiritual love, according to the
   view of Chrysostom, with whom, however, I do not agree in the
   interpretation of the preceding words. Now, spiritual love is of such a
   nature as has no view to the world, but is consecrated to the service
   of piety, [286] and has, as it were, an internal root, while carnal
   friendships depend on external causes.

   Colossians 1:9-11

   9. For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to
   pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge
   of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;

   9. Propterea nos quoque, ex quo die audivimus, non cessamus pro vobis
   orare, et petere ut impleamini cognitione voluntatis ipsius, in omni
   sapientia et prudentia [287] spirituali:

   10. That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being
   fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;

   10. Ut ambuletis digne Deo, in omne obsequium, in omni bono opere
   fructificantes, et crescentes in cognitione Dei:

   11. Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto
   all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;

   11. Omni robore roborati, secundum potentiam gloriae ipsius, in omnem
   tolerantiam et patientiam, cum gaudio.


   9. For this cause we also. As he has previously shewn his affection for
   them in his thanksgivings, so he now shews it still farther in the
   earnestness of his prayers in their behalf. [288] And, assuredly, the
   more that the grace of God is conspicuous in any, we ought in that
   proportion specially to love and esteem them, and to be concerned as to
   their welfare. But what does he pray for in their behalf? That they may
   know God more fully; by which he indirectly intimates, that something
   is still wanting in them, that he may prepare the way for imparting
   instruction to them, and may secure their attention to a fuller
   statement of doctrine. For those who think that they have already
   attained everything that is worthy of being known, despise and disdain
   everything farther that is presented to them. Hence he removes from the
   Colossians an impression of this nature, lest it should be a hinderance
   in the way of their cheerfully making progress, and allowing what had
   been begun in them to receive an additional polish. But what knowledge
   does he desire in their behalf? The knowledge of the divine will, by
   which expression he sets aside all inventions of men, and all
   speculations that are at variance with the word of God. For his will is
   not to be sought anywhere else than in his word.

   He adds -- in all wisdom; by which he intimates that the will of God,
   of which he had made mention, was the only rule of right knowledge. For
   if any one is desirous simply to know those things which it has pleased
   God to reveal, that is the man who accurately knows what it is to be
   truly wise. If we desire anything beyond that, this will be nothing
   else than to be foolish, by not keeping within due bounds. By the word
   suneseos which we render prudentiam, (prudence,) I understand -- that
   discrimination which proceeds from intelligence. Both are called
   spiritual by Paul, because they are not attained in any other way than
   by the guidance of the Spirit.

   For the animal man does not perceive the things that are of God.
   (1 Corinthians 2:14.)

   So long as men are regulated by their own carnal perceptions, they have
   also their own wisdom, but it is of such a nature as is mere vanity,
   however much they may delight themselves in it. We see what sort of
   theology there is under the Papacy, what is contained in the books of
   philosophers, and what wisdom profane men hold in estimation. Let us,
   however, bear in mind, that the wisdom which is alone commended by Paul
   is comprehended in the will of God.

   10. That ye may walk worthy of God. In the first place he teaches, what
   is the end of spiritual understanding, and for what purpose we ought to
   make proficiency in God's school -- that we may walk worthy of God,
   that is, that it may be manifest in our life, that we have not in vain
   been taught by God. Whoever they may be that do not direct their
   endeavors towards this object, may possibly toil and labor much, but
   they do nothing better than wander about in endless windings, without
   making any progress. [289] Farther, he admonishes us, that if we would
   walk worthy of God, we must above all things take heed that we regulate
   our whole course of life according to the will of God, renouncing our
   own understanding, and bidding farewell to all the inclinations of our
   flesh.

   This also he again confirms by saying -- unto all obedience, or, as
   they commonly say, well-pleasing. Hence if it is asked, what kind of
   life is worthy of God, let us always keep in view this definition of
   Paul -- that it is such a life as, leaving the opinions of men, and
   leaving, in short, all carnal inclination, is regulated so as to be in
   subjection to God alone. From this follow good works, which are the
   fruits that God requires from us.

   Increasing, in the knowledge of God. He again repeats, that they have
   not arrived at such perfection as not to stand in need of farther
   increase; by which admonition he prepares them, and as it were leads
   them by the hand, to an eagerness for proficiency, that they may shew
   themselves ready to listen, and teachable. What is here said to the
   Colossians, let all believers take as said to themselves, and draw from
   this a common exhortation that we must always make progress in the
   doctrine of piety until death.

   11. Strengthened with all might. As he has previously prayed that they
   might have both a sound understanding and the right use of it, so also
   now he prays that they may have courage and constancy. In this manner
   he puts them in mind of their own weakness, for he says, that they will
   not be strong otherwise than by the Lord's help; and not only so, but
   with the view of magnifying this exercise of grace the more, he adds,
   according to his glorious power. "So far from any one being able to
   stand, through dependence on his own strength, the power of God shews
   itself illustriously in helping our infirmity." Lastly, he shews in
   what it is that the strength of believers ought to display itself -- in
   all patience and long-suffering. For they are constantly, while in this
   world, exercised with the cross, and a thousand temptations daily
   present themselves, so as to weigh them down, and they see nothing of
   what God has promised. They must, therefore, arm themselves with an
   admirable patience, that what Isaiah says may be accomplished,

   In hope and in silence shall be your strength. [290]
   (Isaiah 30:15.)

   It is preferable to connect with this sentence the clause, with joy.
   For although the other reading is more commonly to be met with in the
   Latin versions, this is more in accordance with the Greek manuscripts,
   and, unquestionably, patience is not sustained otherwise than by
   alacrity of mind, and will never be maintained with fortitude by any
   one that is not satisfied with his condition.

   Colossians 1:12-17

   12. Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be
   partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:

   12. Gratias agentes Deo et Patri, [291] qui nos fecit idoneos ad
   participationem hereditatis sanctorum in lumine.

   13. Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath
   translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:

   13. Qui eripuit nos ex potestate tenebrarum, et transtulit in regnum
   Filii sui dilecti:

   14. In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness
   of sins:

   14. In quo habemus redemptionem per sanguinem eius, remissionem
   peccatorum:

   15. Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every
   creature:

   15. Qui est imago Dei invisibilis, primogenitus universae creaturae.

   16. For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that
   are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or
   dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by
   him, and for him:

   16. Quoniam in ipso creata sunt omnia, tum quae in coelis sunt, tum
   quae super terram; visibilia et invisibilia; sive throni, sive
   dominationes, sive principatus, sive potestates.

   17. And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.

   17. Omnia per ipsum, et in ipsum creata sunt: et ipse est ante omnia,
   et omnia in ipso constant.


   12. Giving thanks. Again he returns to thanksgiving, that he may take
   this opportunity of enumerating the blessings which had been conferred
   upon them through Christ, and thus he enters upon a full delineation of
   Christ. For this was the only remedy for fortifying the Colossians
   against all the snares, by which the false Apostles endeavored to
   entrap them -- to understand accurately what Christ was. For how comes
   it that we are carried about with so many strange doctrines, (Hebrews
   13:9) but because the excellence of Christ is not perceived by us? For
   Christ alone makes all other things suddenly vanish. Hence there is
   nothing that Satan so much endeavors to accomplish as to bring on mists
   with the view of obscuring Christ, because he knows, that by this means
   the way is opened up for every kind of falsehood. This, therefore, is
   the only means of retaining, as well as restoring pure doctrine -- to
   place Christ before the view such as he is with all his blessings, that
   his excellence may be truly perceived.

   The question here is not as to the name. Papists in common with us
   acknowledge one and the same Christ; yet in the mean time how great a
   difference there is between us and them, inasmuch as they, after
   confessing Christ to be the Son of God, transfer his excellence to
   others, and scatter it hither and thither, and thus leave him next to
   empty, [292] or at least rob him of a great part of his glory, so that
   he is called, it is true, by them the Son of God, but, nevertheless, he
   is not such as the Father designed he should be towards us. If,
   however, Papists would cordially embrace what is contained in this
   chapter, we would soon be perfectly agreed, but the whole of Popery
   would fall to the ground, for it cannot stand otherwise than through
   ignorance of Christ. This will undoubtedly be acknowledged by every one
   that will but consider the main article [293] of this first chapter;
   for his grand object here is that we may know that Christ is the
   beginning, middle, and end -- that it is from him that all things must
   be sought -- that nothing is, or can be found, apart from him. Now,
   therefore, let the readers carefully and attentively observe in what
   colors Paul depicts Christ to us.

   Who hath made us meet. He is still speaking of the Father, because he
   is the beginning, and efficient cause (as they speak) of our salvation.
   As the term God is more distinctly expressive of majesty, so the term
   Father conveys the idea of clemency and benevolent disposition. It
   becomes us to contemplate both as existing in God, that his majesty may
   inspire us with fear and reverence, and that his fatherly love may
   secure our full confidence. Hence it is not without good reason that
   Paul has conjoined these two things, if, after all, you prefer the
   rendering which the old interpreter has followed, and which accords
   with some very ancient Greek manuscripts. [294] At the same time there
   will be no inconsistency in saying, that he contents himself with the
   single term, Father. Farther, as it is necessary that his incomparable
   grace should be expressed by the term Father, so it is also not less
   necessary that we should, by the term God, be roused up to admiration
   of so great goodness, that he, who is God, has condescended thus far.
   [295]

   But for what kindness does he give thanks to God? For his having made
   him, and others, meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints.
   For we are born children of wrath, exiles from God's kingdom. It is
   God's adoption that alone makes us meet. Now, adoption depends on an
   unmerited election. The Spirit of regeneration is the seal of adoption.
   He adds, in light, that there might be a contrast -- as opposed to the
   darkness of Satan's kingdom. [296]

   13. Who hath delivered us. Mark, here is the beginning of our salvation
   -- when God delivers us from the depth of ruin into which we were
   plunged. For wherever his grace is not, there is darkness, [297] as it
   is said in Isaiah 60:2

   Behold darkness shall cover the earth, and thick darkness the nations;
   but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon
   thee.

   In the first place, we ourselves are called darkness, and afterwards
   the whole world, and Satan, the Prince of darkness, [298] under whose
   tyranny we are held captive, until we are set free by Christ's hand.
   [299] From this you may gather that the whole world, with all its
   pretended wisdom and righteousness, is regarded as nothing but darkness
   in the sight of God, because, apart from the kingdom of Christ, there
   is no light.

   Hath translated us into the kingdom. These form already the beginnings
   of our blessedness -- when we are translated into the kingdom of
   Christ, because we pass from death into life. (1 John 3:14.) This,
   also, Paul ascribes to the grace of God, that no one may imagine that
   he can attain so great a blessing by his own efforts. As, then, our
   deliverance from the slavery of sin and death is the work of God, so
   also our passing into the kingdom of Christ. He calls Christ the Son of
   his love, or the Son that is beloved by God the Father, because it is
   in him alone that his soul takes pleasure, as we read in Matthew 17:5,
   and in whom all others are beloved. For we must hold it as a settled
   point, that we are not acceptable to God otherwise than through Christ.
   Nor can it be doubted, that Paul had it in view to censure indirectly
   the mortal enmity that exists between men and God, until love shines
   forth in the Mediator.

   14. In whom we have redemption. He now proceeds to set forth in order,
   that all parts of our salvation are contained in Christ, and that he
   alone ought to shine forth, and to be seen conspicuous above all
   creatures, inasmuch as he is the beginning and end of all things. In
   the first place, he says that we have redemption [300] and immediately
   explains it as meaning the remission of sins; for these two things
   agree together by apposition [301] For, unquestionably, when God remits
   our transgressions, he exempts us from condemnation to eternal death.
   This is our liberty, this our glorying in the face of death -- that our
   sins are not imputed to us. He says that this redemption was procured
   through the blood of Christ, for by the sacrifice of his death all the
   sins of the world have been expiated. Let us, therefore, bear in mind,
   that this is the sole price of reconciliation, and that all the
   trifling of Papists as to satisfactions is blasphemy. [302]

   15. Who is the image of the invisible God. He mounts up higher in
   discoursing as to the glory of Christ. He calls him the image of the
   invisible God, meaning by this, that it is in him alone that God, who
   is otherwise invisible, is manifested to us, in accordance with what is
   said in John 1:18,

   -- No man hath ever seen God: the only begotten Son, who is in the
   bosom of the Father, hath himself manifested him to us.

   I am well aware in what manner the ancients were accustomed to explain
   this; for having a contest to maintain with Arians, they insist upon
   the equality of the Son with the Father, and his (homoousian) identity
   of essence, [303] while in the mean time they make no mention of what
   is the chief point -- in what manner the Father makes himself known to
   us in Christ. As to Chrysostom's laying the whole stress of his defense
   on the term image, by contending that the creature cannot be said to be
   the image of the Creator, it is excessively weak; nay more, it is set
   aside by Paul in 1 Corinthians 11:7, whose words are -- The man is the
   IMAGE and glory of God

   That, therefore, we may not receive anything but what is solid, let us
   take notice, that the term image is not made use of in reference to
   essence, but has a reference to us; for Christ is called the image of
   God on this ground -- that he makes God in a manner visible to us. At
   the same time, we gather also from this his (homoousia) identity of
   essence, for Christ would not truly represent God, if he were not the
   essential Word of God, inasmuch as the question here is not as to those
   things which by communication are suitable also to creatures, but the
   question is as to the perfect wisdom, goodness, righteousness, and
   power of God, for the representing of which no creature were competent.
   We shall have, therefore, in this term, a powerful weapon in opposition
   to the Arians, but, notwithstanding, we must begin with that reference
   [304] that I have mentioned; we must not insist upon the essence alone.
   The sum is this -- that God in himself, that is, in his naked majesty,
   is invisible, and that not to the eyes of the body merely, but also to
   the understandings of men, and that he is revealed to us in Christ
   alone, that we may behold him as in a mirror. For in Christ he shews us
   his righteousness, goodness, wisdom, power, in short, his entire self.
   We must, therefore, beware of seeking him elsewhere, for everything
   that would set itself off as a representation of God, apart from
   Christ, will be an idol.

   The first-born of every creature. The reason of this appellation is
   immediately added -- For in him all things are created, as he is, three
   verses afterwards, called the first-begotten from the dead, because by
   him we all rise again. Hence, he is not called the first-born, simply
   on the ground of his having preceded all creatures in point of time,
   but because he was begotten by the Father, that they might be created
   by him, and that he might be, as it were, the substance or foundation
   of all things. It was then a foolish part that the Arians acted, who
   argued from this that he was, consequently, a creature. For what is
   here treated of is, not what he is in himself, but what he accomplishes
   in others.

   16. Visible and invisible. Both of these kinds were included in the
   foregoing distinction of heavenly and earthly things; but as Paul meant
   chiefly to make that affirmation in reference to Angels, he now makes
   mention of things invisible. Not only, therefore, have those heavenly
   creatures which are visible to our eyes, but spiritual creatures also,
   been created by the Son of God. What immediately follows, whether
   thrones, etc., is as though he had said -- "by whatever name they are
   called."

   By thrones some understand Angels. I am rather, however, of opinion,
   that the heavenly palace of God's majesty is meant by the term, which
   we are not to imagine to be such as our mind can conceive of, but such
   as is suitable to God himself. We see the sun and moon, and the whole
   adorning of heaven, but the glory of God's kingdom is hid from our
   perception, because it is spiritual, and above the heavens. In fine,
   let us understand by the term thrones that seat of blessed immortality
   which is exempted from all change.

   By the other terms he undoubtedly describes the angels. He calls them
   powers, principalities, and dominions, not, as if they swayed any
   separate kingdom, or were endowed with peculiar power, [305] but
   because they are the ministers of Divine power and dominion. [306] It
   is customary, however, that, in so far as God manifests his power in
   creatures, his names are, in that proportion, transferred to them. Thus
   he is himself alone Lord and Father, but those are also called lords
   and fathers whom he dignifies with this honor. Hence it comes that
   angels, as well as judges, are called gods. [307] Hence, in this
   passage also, angels are signalized by magnificent titles, which
   intimate, not what they can do of themselves, or apart from God, but
   what God does by them, and what functions he has assigned to them.
   These things it becomes us to understand in such a manner as to detract
   nothing from the glory of God alone; for he does not communicate his
   power to angels as to lessen his own; he does not work by them in such
   a manner as to resign his power to them; he does not desire that his
   glory should shine forth in them, so as to be obscured in himself.
   Paul, however, designedly extols the dignity of angels in terms thus
   magnificent, that no one may think that it stands in the way of Christ
   alone having the pre-eminence over them. He makes use, therefore, of
   these terms, as it were by way of concession, as though he had said,
   that all their excellence detracts nothing from Christ, [308] however
   honorable the titles with which they are adorned. As for those who
   philosophize on these terms with excessive subtlety, that they may draw
   from them the different orders of angels, let them regale themselves
   with their dainties, but they are assuredly very remote from Paul's
   design.

   17. All things were created by him, and for him. He places angels in
   subjection to Christ, that they may not obscure his glory, for four
   reasons: In the first place, because they were created by him;
   secondly, because their creation ought to be viewed as having a
   relation to him, as their legitimate end; thirdly, because he himself
   existed always, prior to their creation; fourthly, because he sustains
   them by his power, and upholds them in their condition. At the same
   time, he does not affirm this merely as to angels, but also as to the
   whole world. Thus he places the Son of God in the Highest seat of
   honor, that he may have the pre-eminence over angels as well as men,
   and may bring under control all creatures in heaven and in earth.

   Colossians 1:18-20

   18. And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning,
   the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the
   preeminence:

   18. Et ipse est caput corporis Ecclesiae, ipse principium, primogenitus
   mortuis, ut sit in omnibus ipse primas tenens:

   19. For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell;

   19. Quoniam in ipso placuit omnem plenitudinem inhabitare.

   20. And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to
   reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be
   things in earth, or things in heaven.

   20. Et per ipsum reconciliare omnia sibi, pacificando per sanguinem
   crucis eius, per ipsum, tam quae sunt super terram, quam quae sunt in
   coelis.


   18. The head of the body. Having discoursed in a general way of
   Christ's excellence, and of his sovereign dominion over all creatures,
   he again returns to those things which relate peculiarly to the Church.
   Under the term head some consider many things to be included. And,
   unquestionably, he makes use afterwards, as we shall find, of the same
   metaphor in this sense -- that as in the human body it serves as a
   root, from which vital energy is diffused through all the members, so
   the life of the Church flows out from Christ, etc. (Colossians 2:19.)
   Here, however, in my opinion, he speaks chiefly of government. He
   shews, therefore, that it is Christ that alone has authority to govern
   the Church, that it is he to whom alone believers ought to have an eye,
   and on whom alone the unity of the body depends.

   Papists, with the view of supporting the tyranny of their idol, allege
   that the Church would be (akephalon) without a head, [309] if the Pope
   did not, as a head, exercise rule in it. Paul, however, does not allow
   this honor even to angels, and yet he does not maim the Church, by
   depriving her of her head; for as Christ claims for himself this title,
   so he truly exercises the office. I am also well aware of the cavil by
   which they attempt to escape -- that the Pope is a ministerial head.
   The name, however, of head is too august to be rightfully transferred
   to any mortal man, [310] under any pretext, especially without the
   command of Christ. Gregory shews greater modesty, who says (in his 92nd
   Epistle, 4th Book) that Peter was indeed one of the chief members of
   the Church, but that he and the other Apostles were members under one
   head.

   He is the beginning. As arche is sometimes made use of among the Greeks
   to denote the end, to which all things bear a relation, we might
   understand it as meaning, that Christ is in this sense (arche) the end.
   I prefer, however, to explain Paul's words thus -- that he is the
   beginning, because he is the first-born from the dead; for in the
   resurrection there is a restoration of all things, and in this manner
   the commencement of the second and new creation, for the former had
   fallen to pieces in the ruin of the first man. As, then, Christ in
   rising again had made a commencement of the kingdom of God, he is on
   good grounds called the beginning; for then do we truly begin to have a
   being in the sight of God, when we are renewed, so as to be new
   creatures. He is called the first-begotten from the dead, not merely
   because he was the first that rose again, but because he has also
   restored life to others, as he is elsewhere called the first-fruits of
   those that rise again. (1 Corinthians 15:20.)

   That he may in all things. From this he concludes, that supremacy
   belongs to him in all things. For if he is the Author and Restorer of
   all things, it is manifest that this honor is justly due to him. At the
   same time the phrase in omnibus (in all things) may be taken in two
   ways -- either over all creatures, or, in everything. This, however, is
   of no great importance, for the simple meaning is, that all things are
   subjected to his sway.

   19. Because it hath pleased the Father that in him. With the view of
   confirming what he has declared respecting Christ, he now adds, that it
   was so arranged in the providence of God. And, unquestionably, in order
   that we may with reverence adore this mystery, it is necessary that we
   should be led back to that fountain. "This," says he, "has been in
   accordance with the counsel of God, that all fullness may dwell in
   him." Now, he means a fullness of righteousness, wisdom, power, and
   every blessing. For whatever God has he has conferred upon his Son,
   that he may be glorified in him, as is said in John 5:20. He shews us,
   however, at the same time, that we must draw from the fullness of
   Christ everything good that we desire for our salvation, because such
   is the determination of God -- not to communicate himself, or his gifts
   to men, otherwise than by his Son. "Christ is all things to us: apart
   from him we have nothing." Hence it follows, that all that detract from
   Christ, or that impair his excellence, or rob him of his offices, or,
   in fine, take away a drop from his fullness, overturn, so far as is in
   their power, God's eternal counsel.

   20. And by him to reconcile all things to himself. This, also, is a
   magnificent commendation of Christ, that we cannot be joined to God
   otherwise than through him. In the first place, let us consider that
   our happiness consists in our cleaving to God, and that, on the other
   hand, there is nothing more miserable than to be alienated from him. He
   declares, accordingly, that we are blessed through Christ alone,
   inasmuch as he is the bond of our connection with God, and, on the
   other hand, that, apart from him, we are most miserable, because we are
   shut out from God. [311] Let us, however, bear in mind, that what he
   ascribes to Christ belongs peculiarly to him, that no portion of this
   praise may be transferred to any other. [312] Hence we must consider
   the contrasts to these things to be understood -- that if this is
   Christ's prerogative, it does not belong to others. For of set purpose
   he disputes against those who imagined that the angels were
   pacificators, through whom access to God might be opened up.

   Making peace through the blood of his cross. He speaks of the Father,
   -- that he has been made propitious to his creatures by the blood of
   Christ. Now he calls it the blood of the cross, inasmuch as it was the
   pledge and price of the making up of our peace with God, because it was
   poured out upon the cross. For it was necessary that the Son of God
   should be an expiatory victim, and endure the punishment of sin, that
   we might be the righteousness of God in him. (2 Corinthians 5:21.) The
   blood of the cross, therefore, means the blood of the sacrifice which
   was offered upon the cross for appeasing the anger of God.

   In adding by him, he did not mean to express anything new, but to
   express more distinctly what he had previously stated, and to impress
   it still more deeply on their minds -- that Christ alone is the author
   of reconciliation, as to exclude all other means. For there is no other
   that has been crucified for us. Hence it is he alone, by whom and for
   whose sake we have God propitious to us.

   Both upon earth and in heaven. If you are inclined to understand this
   as referring merely to rational creatures, it will mean, men and
   angels. There were, it is true, no absurdity in extending it to all
   without exception; but that I may not be under the necessity of
   philosophizing with too much subtlety, I prefer to understand it as
   referring to angels and men; and as to the latter, there is no
   difficulty as to their having need of a peace maker in the sight of
   God. As to angels, however, there is a question not easy of solution.
   For what occasion is there for reconciliation, where there is no
   discord or hatred? Many, influenced by this consideration, have
   explained the passage before us in this manner -- that angels have been
   brought into agreement with men, and that by this means heavenly
   creatures have been restored to favor with earthly creatures. Another
   meaning, however, is conveyed by Paul's words, that God hath reconciled
   to himself. That explanation, therefore, is forced.

   It remains, that we see what is the reconciliation of angels and men. I
   say that men have been reconciled to God, because they were previously
   alienated from him by sin, and because they would have had him as a
   Judge to their ruin, [313] had not the grace of the Mediator interposed
   for appeasing his anger. Hence the nature of the peace making between
   God and men was this, that enmities have been abolished through Christ,
   and thus God becomes a Father instead of a Judge.

   Between God and angels the state of matters is very different, for
   there was there [314] no revolt, no sin, and consequently no
   separation. It was, however, necessary that angels, also, should be
   made to be at peace with God, for, being creatures, they were not
   beyond the risk of falling, had they not been confirmed by the grace of
   Christ. This, however, is of no small importance for the perpetuity of
   peace with God, to have a fixed standing in righteousness, so as to
   have no longer any fear of fall or revolt. Farther, in that very
   obedience which they render to God, there is not such absolute
   perfection as to give satisfaction to God in every respect, and without
   the need of pardon. And this beyond all doubt is what is meant by that
   statement in Job 4:18, He will find iniquity in his angels. For if it
   is explained as referring to the devil, what mighty thing were it? But
   the Spirit declares there, that the greatest purity is vile, [315] if
   it is brought into comparison with the righteousness of God. We must,
   therefore, conclude, that there is not on the part of angels so much of
   righteousness as would suffice for their being fully joined with God.
   They have, therefore, need of a peace maker, through whose grace they
   may wholly cleave to God. Hence it is with propriety that Paul
   declares, that the grace of Christ does not reside among mankind alone,
   and on the other hand makes it common also to angels. Nor is there any
   injustice done to angels, in sending them to a Mediator, that they may,
   through his kindness, have a well grounded peace with God.

   Should any one, on the pretext of the universality of the expression,
   [316] move a question in reference to devils, whether Christ be their
   peace maker also? I answer, No, not even of wicked men: though I
   confess that there is a difference, inasmuch as the benefit of
   redemption is offered to the latter, but not to the former. [317] This,
   however, has nothing to do with Paul's words, which include nothing
   else than this, that it is through Christ alone, that, all creatures,
   who have any connection at all with God, cleave to him.

   Colossians 1:21-23

   21. And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by
   wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled

   21. Et vos quum aliquando essetis alienati, et inimici cogitatione in
   operibus malis,

   22. In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and
   unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:

   22. Nunc reconciliavit in corpore carnis suae per mortem; ut sisteret
   vos sanctos et irreprehensibiles in conspectu suo:

   23. If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved
   away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was
   preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am
   made a minister;

   23. Si quidem permanetis fide fundati et firmi, et non dimoveamini a
   spe Evangelii quod audistis: quod praedicatum est apud universam
   creaturam, quae sub coelo est: cuius factus sum ego Paulus minister.


   21. And whereas ye were formerly. The general doctrine which he had set
   forth he now applies particularly to them, that they may feel that they
   are guilty of very great ingratitude, if they allow themselves to be
   drawn away from Christ to new inventions. And this arrangement must be
   carefully observed, because the particular application of a doctrine,
   so to speak, affects the mind more powerfully. Farther, he leads their
   views to experience, that they may recognize in themselves the benefit
   of that redemption of which he had made mention. "You are yourselves a
   sample [318] of that grace which I declare to have been offered to
   mankind through Christ. For ye were alienated, that is, from God. Ye
   were enemies; now ye are received into favor: whence comes this? It is
   because God, being appeased by the death of Christ, has become
   reconciled to you." At the same time, there is in this statement a
   change of person, for what he has previously declared as to the Father,
   he now affirms respecting Christ; for we must necessarily explain it
   thus, in the body of HIS flesh

   The term dianoias (thought) I explain, as employed by way of
   amplification, as though he had said, that they were altogether, and in
   the whole of their mental system, alienated from God, that no one may
   imagine, after the manner of philosophers, that the alienation is
   merely in a particular part, as Popish theologians restrict it to the
   lower appetites. "Nay," says Paul, "what made you odious to God, had
   taken possession of your whole mind." In fine, he meant to intimate,
   that man, whatever he may be, is wholly at variance with God, and is an
   enemy to him. The old interpreter renders it (sensum) sense. Erasmus
   renders it mentem, (mind.) I have made use of the term cogitationis, to
   denote what the French call intention. For such is the force of the
   Greek word, and Paul's meaning requires that it should be rendered so.

   Farther, while the term enemies has a passive as well as active
   signification, it is well suited to us in both respects, so long as we
   are apart from Christ. For we are born children of wrath, and every
   thought of the flesh is enmity against God. (Romans 8:7.)

   In wicked works. He shews from its effects the inward hatred which lies
   hid in the heart. For as mankind endeavor to free themselves from all
   blame, until they have been openly convicted, God shews them their
   impiety by outward works, as is more amply treated of in Romans 1:19.
   Farther, what is told us here as to the Colossians, is applicable to us
   also, for we differ nothing in respect of nature. There is only this
   difference, that some are called from their mother's womb, whose malice
   God anticipates, so as to prevent them from breaking forth into open
   fruits, while others, after having wandered during a great part of
   their life, are brought back to the fold. We all, however, stand in
   need of Christ as our peace maker, because we are the slaves of sin,
   and where sin is, there is enmity between God and men.

   22. In the body of his flesh. The expression is in appearance absurd,
   but the body of his flesh means that human body, which the Son of God
   had in common with us. He meant, therefore, to intimate, that the Son
   of God had put on the same nature with us, that he took upon him this
   vile earthly body, subject to many infirmities, that he might be our
   Mediator. When he adds, by death, he again calls us back to sacrifice.
   For it was necessary that the Son of God should become man, and be a
   partaker of our flesh, that he might be our brother: it was necessary
   that he should by dying become a sacrifice, that he might make his
   Father propitious to us.

   That he might present us holy. Here we have the second and principal
   part of our salvation -- newness of life. For the entire blessing of
   redemption consists mainly in these two things, remission of sins, and
   spiritual regeneration. (Jeremiah 31:33.) What he has already spoken of
   was a great matter, that righteousness has been procured for us through
   the death of Christ, so that, our sins being remitted, we are
   acceptable to God. Now, however, he teaches us, that there is in
   addition to this another benefit equally distinguished -- the gift of
   the Holy Spirit, by which we are renewed in the image of God. This,
   also, is a passage worthy of observation, as shewing that a gratuitous
   righteousness is not conferred upon us in Christ, without our being at
   the same time regenerated by the Spirit to the obedience of
   righteousness, as he teaches us elsewhere, that

   Christ is made to us righteousness and sanctification.
   (1 Corinthians. 1:30.)

   The former we obtain by a gratuitous acceptance; [319] and the latter
   by the gift of the Holy Spirit, when we are made new creatures. There
   is however an inseparable connection between these two blessings of
   grace.

   Let us, however, take notice, that this holiness is nothing more than
   begun in us, and is indeed every day making progress, but will not be
   perfected until Christ shall appear for the restoration of all things.
   For the Coelestinians [320] and the Pelagians in ancient times
   mistakingly perverted this passage, so as to shut out the gracious
   benefit of the remission of sins. For they conceived of a perfection in
   this world which could satisfy the judgment of God, so that mercy was
   not needed. Paul, however, does not by any means shew us here what is
   accomplished in this world, but what is the end of our calling, and
   what blessings are brought to us by Christ.

   23. If ye continue. Here we have an exhortation to perseverance, by
   which he admonishes them that all the grace that had been conferred
   upon them hitherto would be vain, unless they persevered in the purity
   of the gospel. And thus he intimates, that they are still only making
   progress, and have not yet reached the goal. For the stability of their
   faith was at that time exposed to danger through the stratagems of the
   false apostles. Now he paints in lively colors assurance of faith when
   he bids the Colossians be grounded and settled in it. For faith is not
   like mere opinion, which is shaken by various movements, but has a firm
   steadfastness, which can withstand all the machinations of hell. Hence
   the whole system of Popish theology will never afford even the
   slightest taste of true faith, which holds it as a settled point, that
   we must always be in doubt respecting the present state of grace, as
   well as respecting final perseverance. He afterwards takes notice also
   of a relationship [321] which subsists between faith and the gospel,
   when he says that the Colossians will be settled in the faith only in
   the event of their not falling back from the hope of the gospel; that
   is, the hope which shines forth upon us through means of the gospel,
   for where the gospel is, there is the hope of everlasting salvation.
   Let us, however, bear in mind, that the sum of all is contained in
   Christ. Hence he enjoins it upon them here to shun all doctrines which
   lead away from Christ, so that the minds of men are otherwise occupied.

   Which ye have heard. As the false apostles themselves, who tear and
   rend Christ in pieces, are accustomed proudly to glory in the name of
   the gospel, and as it is a common artifice of Satan to trouble men's
   consciences under a false pretext of the gospel, that the truth of the
   gospel may be brought into confusion, [322] Paul, on this account,
   expressly declares, that that was the genuine, [323] that the undoubted
   gospel, which the Colossians had heard, namely, from Epaphras, that
   they might not lend an ear to doctrines at variance with it. He adds,
   besides, a confirmation of it, that it is the very same as was preached
   over the whole world. It is, I say, no ordinary confirmation when they
   hear that they have the whole Church agreeing with them, and that they
   follow no other doctrine than what the Apostles had alike taught and
   was everywhere received.

   It is, however, a ridiculous boasting of Papists, in respect of their
   impugning our doctrine by this argument, that it is not preached
   everywhere with approbation and applause, inasmuch as we have few that
   assent to it. For though they should burst, they will never deprive us
   of this -- that we at this day teach nothing but what was preached of
   old by Prophets and Apostles, and is obediently received by the whole
   band of saints. For Paul did not mean that the gospel should be
   approved of by the consent of all ages [324] in such a way that, if it
   were rejected, its authority would be shaken. He had, on the contrary,
   an eye to that commandment of Christ,

   Go, preach the gospel to every creature; (Mark 16:15;)

   which commandment depends on so many predictions of the Prophets,
   foretelling that the kingdom of Christ would be spread over the whole
   world. What else then does Paul mean by these words than that the
   Colossians had also been watered by those living streams, which,
   springing forth from Jerusalem, were to flow out through the whole
   world? (Zechariah 14:8.)

   We also do not glory in vain, or without remarkable fruit and
   consolation, [325] that we have the same gospel, which is preached
   among all nations by the commandment of the Lord, which is received by
   all the Churches, and in the profession of which all pious persons have
   lived and died. It is also no common help for fortifying us against so
   many assaults, that we have the consent of the whole Church -- such, I
   mean, as is worthy of so distinguished a title. We also cordially
   subscribe to the views of Augustine, who refutes the Donatists [326] by
   this argument particularly, that they bring forward a gospel that is in
   all the Churches unheard of and unknown. This truly is said on good
   grounds, for if it is a true gospel that is brought forward, while not
   ratified by any approbation on the part of the Church, it follows, that
   vain and false are the many promises in which it is predicted that the
   preaching of the gospel will be carried through the whole world, and
   which declare that the sons of God shall be gathered from all nations
   and countries, etc. (Hosea 1:10-11.) But what do Papists do? Having bid
   farewell to Prophets and Apostles, and passing by the ancient Church,
   they would have their revolt from the gospel be looked upon as the
   consent of the universal Church. Where is the resemblance? Hence, when
   there is a dispute as to the consent of the Church, let us return to
   the Apostles and their preaching, as Paul does here. Farther, lest any
   one should explain too rigidly the term denoting universality, [327]
   Paul means simply, that it had been preached everywhere far and wide.

   Of which I am made. He speaks also of himself personally, and this was
   very necessary, for we must always take care, that we do not rashly
   intrude ourselves into the office of teaching. [328] He accordingly
   declares, that this office was appointed him, that he may secure for
   himself right and authority. And, indeed, he so connects his
   apostleship with their faith, that they may not have it in their power
   to reject his doctrine otherwise than by abandoning the gospel which
   they had embraced.

   Colossians 1:24-29

   24. Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is
   behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake,
   which is the church:

   24. Nunc gaudeo in passionibus pro vobis, et adimpleo ea quae desunt
   afflictionibus Christi in carne mea, pro corpore eius, quod est
   Ecclesia:

   25. Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God
   which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;

   25. Cuius factus sum minister, secundum dispensationem Dei, quae mihi
   data est erga vos, ad implendum sermonem Dei:

   26 Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations,
   but now is made manifest to his saints:

   26. Mysterium reconditum a saeculis et generationibus, quod nunc
   revelatum est sanctis eius.

   27. To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of
   this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of
   glory:

   27. Quibus voluit Deus patefacere, quae sint divitiae gloriae mysterii
   huius in Gentibus, qui est Christus in vobis, spes gloriae:

   28. Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all
   wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:

   28. Quem nos praedicamus, admonentes omnem hominem, et docentes omnem
   hominem in omni sapientia, ut sistamus omnem hominem perfectum in
   Christo Iesu.

   29. Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which
   worketh in me mightily.

   29. In quam rem etiam laboro, decertans secundum potentiam eius, quae
   operatur in me potenter.


   24. I now rejoice. He has previously claimed for himself authority on
   the ground of his calling. Now, however, he provides against the honor
   of his apostleship being detracted from by the bonds and persecutions,
   which he endured for the sake of the gospel. For Satan, also,
   perversely turns these things into occasions of rendering the servants
   of God the more contemptible. Farther, he encourages them by his
   example not to be intimidated by persecutions, and he sets forth to
   their view his zeal, that he may have greater weight. [329] Nay more,
   he gives proof of his affection towards them by no common pledge, when
   he declares that he willingly bears for their sake the afflictions
   which he endures. "But whence," some one will ask, "arises this joy?"
   From his seeing the fruit that springs from it. "The affliction that I
   endure on your account is pleasant to me, because I do not suffer it in
   vain." [330] In the same manner, in his First Epistle to the
   Thessalonians, he says, that he rejoiced in all necessities and
   afflictions, on the ground of what he had heard as to their faith. (1
   Thessalonians 3:6, 7.)

   And fill up what is wanting. The particle and I understand as meaning
   for, for he assigns a reason why he is joyful in his sufferings,
   because he is in this thing a partner with Christ, and nothing happier
   can be desired than this partnership. [331] He also brings forward a
   consolation common to all the pious, that in all tribulations,
   especially in so far as they suffer anything for the sake of the
   gospel, they are partakers of the cross of Christ, that they may enjoy
   fellowship with him in a blessed resurrection.

   Nay more, he declares that there is thus filled up what is wanting in
   the affliction of Christ. For as he speaks in Romans 8:29,

   Whom God elected, he also hath predestinated to be conformed to the
   image of Christ, that he may be the first-born among the brethren.

   Farther, we know that there is so great a unity between Christ and his
   members, that the name of Christ sometimes includes the whole body, as
   in 1 Corinthians. 12:12, for while discoursing there respecting the
   Church, he comes at length to the conclusion, that in Christ the same
   thing holds as in the human body. As, therefore, Christ has suffered
   once in his own person, so he suffers daily in his members, and in this
   way there are filled up those sufferings which the Father hath
   appointed for his body by his decree. [332] Here we have a second
   consideration, which ought to bear up our minds and comfort them in
   afflictions, that it is thus fixed and determined by the providence of
   God, that we must be conformed to Christ in the endurance of the cross,
   and that the fellowship that we have with him extends to this also.

   He adds, also, a third reason -- that his sufferings are advantageous,
   and that not merely to a few, but to the whole Church. He had
   previously stated that he suffered in behalf of the Colossians, and he
   now declares still farther, that the advantage extends to the whole
   Church. This advantage has been spoken of in Philippians 1:12. What
   could be clearer, less forced, or more simple, than this exposition,
   that Paul is joyful in persecution, because he considers, in accordance
   with what he writes elsewhere, that we must

   carry about with us in our body the mortification of Christ, that his
   life may be manifested in us? (2 Corinthians 4 10.)

   He says also in Timothy,

   If we suffer with him, we shall also reign with him: if we die with
   him, we shall also live with him, (2 Timothy 2:11-12)

   and thus the issue will be blessed and glorious. Farther, he considers
   that we must not refuse the condition which God has appointed for his
   Church, that the members of Christ may have a suitable correspondence
   with the head; and, thirdly, that afflictions must be cheerfully
   endured, inasmuch as they are profitable to all the pious, and promote
   the welfare of the whole Church, by adorning the doctrine of the
   gospel.

   Papists, however, disregarding and setting aside all these things,
   [333] have struck out a new contrivance in order that they may
   establish their system of indulgences. They give the name of
   indulgences to a remission of punishments, obtained by us through the
   merits of the martyrs. For, as they deny that there is a gratuitous
   remission of sins, and allege that they are redeemed by satisfactory
   deeds, when the satisfactions do not fill up the right measure, they
   call into their help the blood of the martyrs, that it may, along with
   the blood of Christ, serve as an expiation in the judgment of God. And
   this mixture they call the treasure of the Church [334] , the keys of
   which they afterwards intrust to whom they think fit. Nor are they
   ashamed to wrest this passage, with the view of supporting so execrable
   a blasphemy, as if Paul here affirmed that his sufferings are of avail
   for expiating the sins of men.

   They urge in their support the term husteremata, (things wanting,) as
   if Paul meant to say, that the sufferings which Christ has endured for
   the redemption of men were insufficient. There is no one, however, that
   does not see that Paul speaks in this manner, because it is necessary,
   that by the afflictions of the pious, the body of the Church should be
   brought to its perfection, inasmuch as the members are conformed to
   their head. [335] I should also be afraid of being suspected of calumny
   in repeating things so monstrous, [336] if their books did not bear
   witness that I impute nothing to them groundlessly. They urge, also,
   what Paul says, that he suffers for the Church. It is surprising that
   this refined interpretation had not occurred to any of the ancients,
   for they all interpret it as we do, to mean, that the saints suffer for
   the Church, inasmuch as they confirm the faith of the Church. Papists,
   however, gather from this that the saints are redeemers, because they
   shed their blood for the expiation of sins. That my readers, however,
   may perceive more clearly their impudence, allow that the martyrs, as
   well as Christ, suffered for the Church, but in different ways, as I am
   inclined to express in Augustine's words rather than in my own. For he
   writes thus in his 84th treatise on John: "Though we brethren die for
   brethren, yet there is no blood of any martyr that is poured out for
   the remission of sins. This Christ did for us. Nor has he in this
   conferred upon us matter of imitation, but ground of thanksgiving."
   Also, in the fourth book to Bonifacius: "As the only Son of God became
   the Son of man, that he might make us sons of God, so he has alone,
   without offense, endured punishment for us, that we may through him,
   without merit, obtain undeserved favor." Similar to these is the
   statement of Leo Bishop of Rome; "The righteous received crowns, did
   not give them; and for the fortitude of believers there have come forth
   examples of patience, not gifts of righteousness. For their deaths were
   for themselves, and no one by his latter end paid the debt of another."
   [337]

   Now, that this is the meaning of Paul's words is abundantly manifest
   from the context, for he adds, that he suffers according to the
   dispensation that was given to him. And we know that the ministry was
   committed to him, not of redeeming the Church, but of edifying it; and
   he himself immediately afterwards expressly acknowledges this. This is
   also what he writes to Timothy,

   that he endures all things for the sake of the elect, that they may
   obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus.
   (2 Timothy 2:10.)

   Also, in 2 Corinthians 1:4, [338] that

   he willingly endures all things for their consolation and salvation.

   Let, therefore, pious readers learn to hate and detest those profane
   sophists, who thus deliberately corrupt and adulterate the Scriptures,
   in order that they may give some color to their delusions.

   25. Of which I am made a minister. Mark under what character he suffers
   for the Church -- as being a minister, not to give the price of
   redemption, (as Augustine dexterously and piously expresses himself,)
   but to proclaim it. He calls himself, however, in this instance, a
   minister of the Church on a different ground from that on which he
   called himself elsewhere, (1 Corinthians 4:1,) a minister of God, and a
   little ago, (Colossians 1:23,) a minister of the gospel. For the
   Apostles serve God and Christ for the advancement of the glory of both:
   they serve the Church, and administer the gospel itself, with a view to
   promote salvation. There is, therefore, a different reason for the
   ministry in these expressions, but the one cannot subsist without the
   other. He says, however, towards you, that they may know that his
   office has a connection also with them.

   To fulfill the word. He states the end of his ministry -- that the word
   of God may be effectual, as it is, when it is obediently received. For
   this is the excellence of the gospel, that it is the

   power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.
   (Romans 1:16.)

   God, therefore, gives efficacy and influence to his word through means
   of the Apostles. For although preaching itself, whatever may be its
   issue, is the fulfilling of the word, yet it is the fruit that shews at
   length [339] that the seed has not been sown in vain.

   26. Hidden mystery. Here we have a commendation of the gospel -- that
   it is a wonderful secret of God. It is not without good reason that
   Paul so frequently extols the gospel by bestowing upon it the highest
   commendations in his power; for he saw that it was

   a stumblingblock to the Jews, and foolishness to the Greeks.
   (1 Corinthians 1:23.)

   We see also at this day, in what hatred it is held by hypocrites, and
   how haughtily it is contemned by the world. Paul, accordingly, with the
   view of setting aside judgments so unfair and perverse, extols in
   magnificent terms the dignity of the gospel as often as an opportunity
   presents itself, and for that purpose he makes use of various
   arguments, according to the connection of the passage. Here he calls it
   a sublime secret, which was hid from ages and generations, that is,
   from the beginning of the world, through so many revolutions of ages.
   [340] Now, that it is of the gospel that he speaks, is evident from
   Romans 16:25, Ephesians 3:9, and other similar passages.

   The reason, however, why it is so called, is demanded. Some, in
   consequence of Paul's making express mention of the calling of the
   Gentiles, are of opinion, that the sole reason why it is so called is,
   that the Lord had, in a manner, contrary to all expectation, poured out
   his grace upon the Gentiles, whom he had appeared to have shut out for
   ever from participation in eternal life. Any one, however, that will
   examine the whole passage more narrowly, will perceive that this is the
   third reason, not the only one, in so far, I mean, as relates to the
   passage before us, and that other in the Romans, to which I have
   referred. For the first is -- that whereas God had, previously to the
   advent of Christ, governed his Church under dark coverings, both of
   words and of ceremonies, he has suddenly shone forth in full brightness
   by means of the doctrine of the gospel. The second is -- that whereas
   nothing was previously seen but external figures, Christ has been
   exhibited, bringing with him the full truth, which had lain concealed.
   The third is, what I have mentioned -- that the whole world, which had
   up to this time been estranged from God, is called to the hope of
   salvation, and the same inheritance of eternal life is offered to all.
   An attentive consideration of these things constrains us to reverence
   and adore this mystery which Paul proclaims, however it may be held in
   contempt by the world, or even in derision.

   Which is now revealed. Lest any one should turn aside to another
   meaning the term mystery, as though he were speaking of a thing that
   was still secret and unknown, he adds, that it has now at length been
   published, [341] that it might be known by mankind. What, therefore,
   was in its own nature secret, has been made manifest by the will of
   God. Hence, there is no reason why its obscurity should alarm us, after
   the revelation that God has made of it. He adds, however, to the
   saints, for God's arm has not been revealed to all, (Isaiah 53:1,) that
   they might understand his counsel.

   27. To whom God was pleased to make known. Here he puts a bridle upon
   the presumption of men, that they may not allow themselves to be wise,
   or to inquire beyond what they ought, but may learn to rest satisfied
   with this one thing that it has so pleased God. For the good pleasure
   of God ought to be perfectly sufficient for us as a reason. This,
   however, is said principally for the purpose of commending the grace of
   God; for Paul intimates, that mankind did by no means furnish occasion
   for God's making them participants of this secret, when he teaches that
   he was led to this of his own accord, and because he was pleased to do
   so. For it is customary for Paul to place the good pleasure of God in
   opposition to all human merits and external causes.

   What are the riches. We must always take notice, in what magnificent
   terms he speaks in extolling the dignity of the gospel. For he was well
   aware that the ingratitude of men is so great, that notwithstanding
   that this treasure is inestimable, and the grace of God in it is so
   distinguished, they, nevertheless, carelessly despise it, or at least
   think lightly of it. Hence, not resting satisfied with the term
   mystery, he adds glory, and that, too, not trivial or common. For
   riches, according to Paul, denote, as is well known, amplitude. [342]
   He states particularly, that those riches have been manifested among
   the Gentiles; for what is more wonderful than that the Gentiles, who
   had during so many ages been sunk in death, so as to appear to be
   utterly ruined, are all on a sudden reckoned among the sons of God, and
   receive the inheritance of salvation?

   Which is Christ in you. What he had said as to the Gentiles generally
   he applies to the Colossians themselves, that they may more effectually
   recognize in themselves the grace of God, and may embrace it with
   greater reverence. He says, therefore, which is Christ, meaning by
   this, that all that secret is contained in Christ, and that all the
   riches of heavenly wisdom are obtained by them when they have Christ,
   as we shall find him stating more openly a little afterwards. He adds,
   in you, because they now possess Christ, from whom they were lately so
   much estranged, that nothing could exceed it. Lastly, he calls Christ
   the hope of glory, that they may know that nothing is wanting to them
   for complete blessedness when they have obtained Christ. This, however,
   is a wonderful work of God, that in earthen and frail vessels (2
   Corinthians 4:7) the hope of heavenly glory resides.

   28. Whom we preach. Here he applies to his own preaching everything
   that he has previously declared as to the wonderful and adorable secret
   of God; and thus he explains what he had already touched upon as to the
   dispensation which had been committed to him; for he has it in view to
   adorn his apostleship, and to claim authority for his doctrine: for
   after having extolled the gospel in the highest terms, he now adds,
   that it is that divine secret which he preaches. It was not, however,
   without good reason that he had taken notice a little before, that
   Christ is the sum of that secret, that they might know that nothing can
   be taught that has more of perfection than Christ.

   The expressions that follow have also great weight. He represents
   himself as the teacher of all men; meaning by this, that no one is so
   eminent in respect of wisdom as to be entitled to exempt himself from
   tuition. "God has placed me in a lofty position, as a public herald of
   his secret, that the whole world, without exception, may learn from
   me."

   In all wisdom. This expression is equivalent to his affirming that his
   doctrine is such as to conduct a man to a wisdom that is perfect, and
   has nothing wanting; and this is what he immediately adds, that all
   that shew themselves to be true disciples will become perfect. See the
   second chapter of First Corinthians. (1 Corinthians 2:6.) Now, what
   better thing can be desired than what confers upon us the highest
   perfection? He again repeats, in Christ, that they may not desire to
   know anything but Christ alone. From this passage, also, we may gather
   a definition of true wisdom -- that by which we are presented perfect
   in the sight of God, and that in Christ, and nowhere else. [343]

   29. For which thing. He enhances, by two circumstances, the glory of
   his apostleship and of his doctrine. In the first place, he makes
   mention of his aim, [344] which is a token of the difficulty that he
   felt; for those things are for the most part the most excellent that
   are the most difficult. The second has more strength, inasmuch as he
   mentions that the power of God shines forth in his ministry. He does
   not speak, however, merely of the success of his preaching, (though in
   that too the blessing of God appears,) but also of the efficacy of the
   Spirit, in which God manifestly shewed himself; for on good grounds he
   ascribes his endeavors, inasmuch as they exceeded human limits, to the
   power of God, which, he declares, is seen working powerfully in this
   matter.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Colossians 2:1-5

   1. For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for
   them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the
   flesh;

   1. Volo autem vos scire, quantum certamen habeam pro vobis et iis qui
   sunt Laodiceae, et quicunque non viderunt faciem meam in carne;

   2. That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love,
   and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the
   acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of
   Christ;

   2. Ut consolationem accipiant corda ipsorum, ubi compacti fuerint in
   caritate, et in omnes divitias certitudinis intelligentiae, in
   agnitionem mysterii Dei, et Patris, et Christi;

   3. In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.

   3. In quo sunt omnes thesauri sapientiae et intelligentiae absconditi.

   4. And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.

   4. Hoc autem dico, ne quis vos decipiat persuasorio sermone.

   5. For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the
   spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your
   faith in Christ.

   5. Nam et si corpore sum absens, spiritu tamen sum vobiscum, gaudens et
   videns ordinem vestrum, et stabilitatem vestrae in Christum fidei.


   1. I would have you know. He declares his affection towards them, that
   he may have more credit and authority; for we readily believe those
   whom we know to be desirous of our welfare. It is also an evidence of
   no ordinary affection, that he was concerned about them in the midst of
   death, that is, when he was in danger of his life; and that he may
   express the more emphatically the intensity of his affection and
   concern, he calls it a conflict. I do not find fault with the rendering
   of Erasmus -- anxiety; but, at the same time, the force of the Greek
   word is to be noticed, for agon is made use of to denote contention. By
   the same proof he confirms his statement, that his ministry is directed
   to them; for whence springs so anxious a concern as to their welfare,
   but from this, that the Apostle of the Gentiles was under obligation to
   embrace in his affection and concern even those who were unknown to
   him? As, however, there is commonly no love between those who are
   unknown to each other, he speaks slightingly of the acquaintance that
   is contracted from sight, when he says, as many as have not seen my
   face in the flesh; for there is among the servants of God a sight
   different from that of the flesh, which excites love. As it is almost
   universally agreed that the First Epistle to Timothy was written from
   Laodicea, some, on this account, assign to Galatia that Laodicea of
   which Paul makes mention here, while the other was the metropolis of
   Phrygia Pacatiana. [345] It seems to me, however, to be more probable
   that that inscription is incorrect, as will be noticed in its proper
   place.

   2. That their hearts may receive consolation. He now intimates what he
   desires for them, and shews that his affection is truly apostolic; for
   he declares that nothing else is desired by him than that they may be
   united together in faith and love. He shews, accordingly, that it was
   by no unreasonable affection (as happens in the case of some) that he
   had been led to take upon himself so great a concern for the Colossians
   and others, but because the duty of his office required it.

   The term consolation is taken here to denote that true quietness in
   which they may repose. This he declares they will at length come to
   enjoy in the event of their being united in love and faith. From this
   it appears where the chief good is, and in what things it consists --
   when mutually agreed in one faith, we are also joined together in
   mutual love. This, I say, is the solid joy of a pious mind -- this is
   the blessed life. As, however, love is here commended from its effect,
   because it fills the mind of the pious with true joy; so, on the other
   hand, the cause of it is pointed out by him, when he says, in all
   fullness of understanding. [346] The bond also of holy unity is the
   truth of God, when we embrace it with one consent; for peace and
   agreement with men flow forth from that fountain.

   Riches of the assurance of understanding. As many, contenting
   themselves with a slight taste, have nothing but a confused and
   evanescent knowledge, he makes mention expressly of the riches of
   understanding. By this phrase he means full and clear perception; and
   at the same time admonishes them, that according to the measure of
   understanding they must make progress also in love.

   In the term assurance, he distinguishes between faith and mere opinion;
   for that man truly knows the Lord who does not vacillate or waver in
   doubt, but stands fast in a firm and constant persuasion. This
   constancy and stability Paul frequently calls (plerophorian) full
   assurance, (which term he makes use of here also,) and always connects
   it with faith, as undoubtedly it can no more be separated from it than
   heat or light can be from the sun. The doctrine, therefore, of the
   schoolmen is devilish, inasmuch as it takes away assurance, and
   substitutes in its place moral conjecture, [347] as they term it.

   Is an acknowledgment of the mystery. This clause must be read as added
   by way of apposition, for he explains what that knowledge is, of which
   he has made mention -- that it is nothing else than the knowledge of
   the gospel. For the false apostles themselves endeavor to set off their
   impostures under the title of wisdom, but Paul retains the sons of God
   within the limits of the gospel exclusively, that they may desire to
   know nothing else. (1 Corinthians 2:2.) Why he uses the term mystery to
   denote the gospel, has been already explained. Let us, however, learn
   from this, that the gospel can be understood by faith alone -- not by
   reason, nor by the perspicacity of the human understanding, because
   otherwise it is a thing that is hid from us.

   The mystery of God I understand in a passive signification, as meaning
   -- that in which God is revealed, for he immediately adds -- and of the
   Father, and of Christ -- by which expression he means that God cannot
   be known otherwise than in Christ, as, on the other hand, the Father
   must necessarily be known where Christ is known. For John affirms both:

   He that hath the Son, hath the Father also: he that hath not the Son,
   hath also not the Father. (1 John 2:23.)

   Hence all that think that they know anything of God apart from Christ,
   contrive to themselves an idol in the place of God; as also, on the
   other hand, that man is ignorant of Christ, who is not led by him to
   the Father, and who does not in him embrace God wholly. In the mean
   time, it is a memorable passage for proving Christ's divinity, and the
   unity of his essence with the Father. For having spoken previously as
   to the knowledge of God, he immediately applies it to the Son, as well
   as to the Father, whence it follows, that the Son is God equally with
   the Father.

   3. In whom are all the treasures. The expression in quo (in whom, or in
   which) may either have a reference collectively to everything he has
   said as to the acknowledgment of the mystery, or it may relate simply
   to what came immediately before, namely, Christ. While there is not
   much difference between the one or the other, I rather prefer the
   latter view, and it is the one that is more generally received. The
   meaning, therefore, is, that all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge
   are hid in Christ -- by which he means, that we are perfect in wisdom
   if we truly know Christ, so that it is madness to wish to know anything
   besides Him. For since the Father has manifested himself wholly in Him,
   that man wishes to be wise apart from God, who is not contented with
   Christ alone. Should any one choose to interpret it as referring to the
   mystery, the meaning will be, that all the wisdom of the pious is
   included in the gospel, by means of which God is revealed to us in his
   Son.

   He says, however, that the treasures are hidden, because they are not
   seen glittering with great splendor, but do rather, as it were, lie hid
   under the contemptible abasement and simplicity of the cross. For the
   preaching of the cross is always foolishness to the world, as we found
   stated in Corinthians. (1 Corinthians 1:18.) I do not reckon that there
   is any great difference between wisdom and understanding in this
   passage, for the employment of two different terms serves only to give
   additional strength, as though he had said, that no knowledge,
   erudition, learning, wisdom, can be found elsewhere.

   4. This I say, that no man may deceive you. As the contrivances of men
   have (as we shall afterwards see) an appearance of wisdom, the minds of
   the pious ought to be preoccupied with this persuasion -- that the
   knowledge of Christ is of itself amply sufficient. And, unquestionably,
   this is the key that can close the door against all base errors. [348]
   For what is the reason why mankind have involved themselves in so many
   wicked opinions, in so many idolatries, in so many foolish
   speculations, but this -- that, despising the simplicity of the gospel,
   they have ventured to aspire higher? All the errors, accordingly, that
   are in Popery, must be reckoned as proceeding from this ingratitude --
   that, not resting satisfied with Christ alone, they have given
   themselves up to strange doctrines.

   With propriety, therefore, does the Apostle act in writing to the
   Hebrews, inasmuch as, when wishing to exhort believers not to allow
   themselves to be led astray [349] by strange or new doctrines, he first
   of all makes use of this foundation --

   Christ yesterday, and to-day, and for ever. (Hebrews 13:8.)

   By this he means, that those are out of danger who remain in Christ,
   but that those who are not satisfied with Christ are exposed to all
   fallacies and deceptions. So Paul here would have every one, that would
   not be deceived, be fortified by means of this principle -- that it is
   not lawful for a Christian man to know anything except Christ.
   Everything that will be brought forward after this, let it have ever so
   imposing an appearance, will, nevertheless, be of no value. In fine,
   there will be no persuasiveness of speech [350] that can turn aside so
   much as the breadth of a finger the minds of those that have devoted
   their understanding to Christ. It is a passage, certainly, that ought
   to be singularly esteemed. For as he who has taught men to know nothing
   except Christ, has provided against all wicked doctrines, [351] so
   there is the same reason why we should at this day destroy the whole of
   Popery, which, it is manifest, is built on ignorance of Christ.

   5. For though I am absent in body. Lest any one should object that the
   admonition was unseasonable, as coming from a place so remote, he says,
   that his affection towards them made him be present with them in
   spirit, and judge of what is expedient for them, as though he were
   present. By praising, also, their present condition, he admonishes them
   not to fall back from it, or turn aside.

   Rejoicing, says he, And seeing, that is -- "Because I see." For and
   means for, as is customary among the Latins and Greeks. "Go on as you
   have begun, for I know that hitherto you have pursued the right course,
   inasmuch as distance of place does not prevent me from beholding you
   with the eyes of the mind."

   Order and steadfastness. He mentions two things, in which the
   perfection of the Church consists -- order among themselves, and faith
   in Christ. By the term order, he means -- agreement, no less than duly
   regulated morals, and entire discipline. He commends their faith, in
   respect of its constancy and steadfastness, meaning that it is an empty
   shadow of faith, when the mind wavers and vacillates between different
   opinions. [352]

   Colossians 2:6-7

   6. As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in
   him:

   6. Quemadmodum igitur suscepistis Christum Iesum Dominum, in ipso
   ambulate:

   7. Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have
   been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.

   7. Radicati in ipso, et aedificati, et confirmati in fide, quemadmodum
   edocti estis, abundantes in ea cum gratiarum actione.


   6. As ye have received. To commendation he adds exhortation, in which
   he teaches them that their having once received Christ will be of no
   advantage to them, unless they remain in him. Farther, as the false
   apostles held forth Christ's name with a view to deceive, he obviates
   this danger twice, by exhorting them to go on as they had been taught,
   and as they had received Christ. For in these words he admonishes them,
   that they must adhere to the doctrine which they had embraced, as
   delivered to them by Epaphras, with so much constancy, as to be on
   their guard against every other doctrine and faith, in accordance with
   what Isaiah said,

   This is the way, walk ye in it. (Isaiah 30 21.)

   And, unquestionbly, we must act in such a manner, that the truth of the
   gospel, after it has been manifested to us, may be to us as a brazen
   wall [353] for keeping back all impostures. [354]

   Now he intimates by three metaphors what steadfastness of faith he
   requires from them. The first is in the word walk. For he compares the
   pure doctrine of the gospel, as they had learned it, to a way that is
   sure, so that if any one will but keep it he will be beyond all danger
   of mistake. He exhorts them, accordingly, if they would not go astray,
   not to turn aside from the course on which they have entered.

   The second is taken from trees. For as a tree that has struck its roots
   deep has a sufficiency of support for withstanding all the assaults of
   winds and storms, so, if any one is deeply and thoroughly fixed in
   Christ, as in a firm root, it will not be possible for him to be thrown
   down from his proper position by any machinations of Satan. On the
   other hand, if any one has not fixed his roots in Christ, [355] he will
   easily be

   carried about with every wind of doctrine, (Ephesians 4:14,)

   just as a tree that is not supported by any root. [356]

   The third metaphor is that of a foundation, for a house that is not
   supported by a foundation quickly falls to ruins. The case is the same
   with those who lean on any other foundation than Christ, or at least
   are not securely founded on him, but have the building of their faith
   suspended, as it were, in the air, in consequence of their weakness and
   levity.

   These two things are to be observed in the Apostle's words -- that the
   stability of those who rely upon Christ is immovable, and their course
   is not at all wavering, or liable to error, (and this is an admirable
   commendation of faith from its effect;) and, secondly, that we must
   make progress in Christ aye and until we have taken deep root in him.
   From this we may readily gather, that those who do not know Christ only
   wander into bypaths, and are tossed about in disquietude.

   7. And confirmed in the faith. He now repeats without a figure the same
   thing that he had expressed by metaphors, -- that the prosecution of
   the way, the support of the root, and of the foundation, is firmness
   and steadfastness of faith. And observe, that this argument is set
   before them in consequence of their having been well instructed, in
   order that they may safely and confidently secure their footing in the
   faith with which they had been made acquainted.

   Abounding. He would not have them simply remain immovable, but would
   have them grow every day more and more. When he adds, with
   thanksgiving, he would have them always keep in mind from what source
   faith itself proceeds, that they may not be puffed up with presumption,
   but may rather with fear repose themselves in the gift of God. And,
   unquestionably, ingratitude is very frequently the reason why we are
   deprived of the light of the gospel, as well as of other divine favors.

   Colossians 2:8-12

   8. Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit,
   after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not
   after Christ.

   8. Videte ne quis vos praedetur per philosophiam et inanem deceptionem,
   secundum traditionem hominum secundum elementa mundi, [357] et non
   secundum Christum:

   9. For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.

   9. Quoniam in ipso habitat omnis plenitudo Deitatis corporaliter. [358]

   10. And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality
   and power:

   10. Et estis in ipso completi, qui est caput omnis principatus et
   potestatis,

   11. In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without
   hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the
   circumcision of Christ:

   11. In quo etiam estis circumcisi circumcisione non manufacta, exuendo
   corpus peccatorum carnis, circumcisione, inquam, Christi.

   12. Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him
   through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the
   dead.

   12. Consepulti cum ipso per baptismum, in quo et consurrexistis per
   fidem efficaciae Dei, qui suscitavit illum ex mortuis.


   8. Beware lest any one plunder you. He again instructs them as to the
   poison, which the antidote presented by him should be made use of to
   counteract. For although this, as we have stated, is a common remedy
   against all the impostures of the devil, [359] it had, nevertheless, at
   that time a peculiar advantage among the Colossians, to which it
   required to be applied. Beware, says he, lest any one plunder you. He
   makes use of a very appropriate term, for he alludes to plunderers,
   who, when they cannot carry off the flock by violence, drive away some
   of the cattle fraudulently. Thus he makes Christ's Church a sheep-fold,
   and the pure doctrine of the gospel the enclosures of the fold. He
   intimates, accordingly, that we who are the sheep of Christ repose in
   safety when we hold the unity of the faith, while, on the other hand,
   he likens the false apostles to plunderers that carry us away from the
   folds. Would you then be reckoned as belonging to Christ's flock? Would
   you remain in his folds? Do not deviate a nail's breadth from purity of
   doctrine. For unquestionably Christ will act the part of the good
   Shepherd by protecting us if we but hear his voice, and reject those of
   strangers. In short, the tenth chapter of John is the exposition of the
   passage before us. [John 10]

   Through philosophy. As many have mistakingly imagined that philosophy
   is here condemned by Paul, we must point out what he means by this
   term. Now, in my opinion, he means everything that men contrive of
   themselves when wishing to be wise through means of their own
   understanding, and that not without a specious pretext of reason, so as
   to have a plausible appearance. For there is no difficulty in rejecting
   those contrivances of men which have nothing to set them off, [360] but
   in rejecting those that captivate men's minds by a false conceit of
   wisdom. Or should any one prefer to have it expressed in one word,
   philosophy is nothing else than a persuasive speech, which insinuates
   itself into the minds of men by elegant and plausible arguments. Of
   such a nature, I acknowledge, will all the subtleties of philosophers
   be, if they are inclined to add anything of their own to the pure word
   of God. Hence philosophy will be nothing else than a corruption of
   spiritual doctrine, if it is mixed up with Christ. Let us, however,
   bear in mind, that under the term philosophy Paul has merely condemned
   all spurious doctrines which come forth from man's head, whatever
   appearance of reason they may have. What immediately follows, as to
   vain deceit, I explain thus; "Beware of philosophy, which is nothing
   else than vain deceit," so that this is added by way of apposition.
   [361]

   According to the tradition of men. He points out more precisely what
   kind of philosophy he reproves, and at the same time convicts it of
   vanity on a twofold account -- because it is not according to Christ,
   but according to the inclinations of men; [362] and because it consists
   in the elements of the world. Observe, however, that he places Christ
   in opposition to the elements of the world, equally as to the tradition
   of men, by which he intimates, that whatever is hatched in man's brain
   is not in accordance with Christ, who has been appointed us by the
   Father as our sole Teacher, that he might retain us in the simplicity
   of his gospel. Now, that is corrupted by even a small portion of the
   leaven of human traditions. He intimates also, that all doctrines are
   foreign to Christ that make the worship of God, which we know to be
   spiritual, according to Christ's rule, to consist in the elements of
   the world, [363] and also such as fetter the minds of men by such
   trifles and frivolities, while Christ calls us directly to himself.

   But what is meant by the phrase -- elements of the world? [364] There
   can be no doubt that it means ceremonies. For he immediately afterwards
   adduces one instance by way of example -- circumcision. The reason why
   he calls them by such a name is usually explained in two ways. Some
   think that it is a metaphor, so that the elements are the rudiments of
   children, which do not lead forward to mature doctrine. Others take it
   in its proper signification, as denoting things that are outward and
   are liable to corruption, which avail nothing for the kingdom of God.
   The former exposition I rather approve of, as also in Galatians 4:3

   9. For in him dwelleth. Here we have the reason why those elements of
   the world, which are taught by men, do not accord with Christ --
   because they are additions for supplying a deficiency, as they speak.
   Now in Christ there is a perfection, to which nothing can be added.
   Hence everything that mankind of themselves mix up, is at variance with
   Christ's nature, because it charges him with imperfection. This
   argument of itself will suffice for setting aside all the contrivances
   of Papists. For to what purpose do they tend, [365] but to perfect what
   was commenced by Christ? [366] Now this outrage upon Christ [367] is
   not by any means to be endured. They allege, it is true, that they add
   nothing to Christ, inasmuch as the things that they have appended to
   the gospel are, as it were, a part of Christianity, but they do not
   effect an escape by a cavil of this kind. For Paul does not speak of an
   imaginary Christ, but of a Christ preached, [368] who has revealed
   himself by express doctrine.

   Further, when he says that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in
   Christ, he means simply, that God is wholly found in him, so that he
   who is not contented with Christ alone, desires something better and
   more excellent than God. The sum is this, that God has manifested
   himself to us fully and perfectly in Christ.

   Interpreters explain in different ways the adverb bodily. For my part,
   I have no doubt that it is employed -- not in a strict sense -- as
   meaning substantially. [369] For he places this manifestation of God,
   which we have in Christ, to all others that have ever been made. For
   God has often manifested himself to men, but it has been only in part.
   In Christ, on the other hand, he communicates himself to us wholly. He
   has also manifested himself to us otherwise, but it is in figures, or
   by power and grace. In Christ, on the other hand, he has appeared to us
   essentially. Thus the statement of John holds good:

   He that hath the Son, hath the Father also. (1 John 2 23.)

   For those who possess Christ have God truly present, and enjoy Him
   wholly.

   10. And ye are complete in him. He adds, that this perfect essence of
   Deity, which is in Christ, is profitable to us in this respect, that we
   are also perfect in him. "As to God's dwelling wholly in Christ, it is
   in order that we, having obtained him, may posses in him an entire
   perfection." Those, therefore, who do not rest satisfied with Christ
   alone, do injury to God in two ways, for besides detracting from the
   glory of God, by desiring something above his perfection, they are also
   ungrateful, inasmuch as they seek elsewhere what they already have in
   Christ. Paul, however, does not mean that the perfection of Christ is
   transfused into us, but that there are in him resources from which we
   may be filled, that nothing may be wanting to us.

   Who is the head. He has introduced this clause again on account of the
   angels, meaning that the angels, also, will be ours, if we have Christ.
   But of this afterwards. In the mean time, we must observe this, that we
   are hemmed in, above and below, with railings, [370] that our faith may
   not deviate even to the slightest extent from Christ.

   11. In whom ye also are circumcised. From this it appears, that he has
   a controversy with the false apostles, who mixed the law with the
   gospel, and by that means made Christ have, as it were, two faces. He
   specifies, however, one instance by way of example. He proves that the
   circumcision of Moses is not merely unnecessary, but is opposed to
   Christ, because it destroys the spiritual circumcision of Christ. For
   circumcision was given to the Fathers that it might be the figure of a
   thing that was absent: those, therefore, who retain that figure after
   Christ's advent, deny the accomplishment of what it prefigures. Let us,
   therefore, bear in mind that outward circumcision is here compared with
   spiritual, just as a figure with the reality. The figure is of a thing
   that is absent: hence it puts away the presence of the reality. What
   Paul contends for is this -- that, inasmuch as what was shadowed forth
   by a circumcision made with hands, has been completed in Christ, there
   is now no fruit or advantage from it. [371] Hence he says, that the
   circumcision which is made in the heart is the circumcision of Christ,
   and that, on this account, that which is outward is not now required,
   because, where the reality exists, that shadowy emblem vanishes, [372]
   inasmuch as it has no place except in the absence of the reality.

   By the putting off of the body. He employs the term body, by an elegant
   metaphor, to denote a mass, made up of all vices. For as we are
   encompassed by our bodies, so we are surrounded on all sides by an
   accumulation of vices. And as the body is composed of various members,
   each of which has its own actings and offices, so from that
   accumulation of corruption all sins take their rise as members of the
   entire body. There is a similar manner of expression in Romans 6:13.

   He takes the term flesh, as he is wont, to denote corrupt nature. The
   body of the sins of the flesh, therefore, is the old man with his
   deeds; only, there is a difference in the manner of expression, for
   here he expresses more properly the mass of vices which proceed from
   corrupt nature. He says that we obtain this [373] through Christ, so
   that unquestionably an entire regeneration is his benefit. It is he
   that circumcises the foreskin of our heart, or, in other words,
   mortifies all the lusts of the flesh, not with the hand, but by his
   Spirit. Hence there is in him the reality of the figure.

   12. Buried with him, in baptism. He explains still more clearly the
   manner of spiritual circumcision -- because, being buried with Christ,
   we are partakers of his death. He expressly declares that we obtain
   this by means of baptism, that it may be the more clearly apparent that
   there is no advantage from circumcision under the reign of Christ. For
   some one might otherwise object: "Why do you abolish circumcision on
   this pretext -- that its accomplishment is in Christ? Was not Abraham,
   also, circumcised spiritually, and yet this did not hinder the adding
   of the sign to the reality? Outward circumcision, therefore, is not
   superfluous, although that which is inward is conferred by Christ."
   Paul anticipates an objection of this kind, by making mention of
   baptism. Christ, says he, accomplishes in us spiritual circumcision,
   not through means of that ancient sign, which was in force under Moses,
   but by baptism. Baptism, therefore, is a sign of the thing that is
   presented to us, which while absent was prefigured by circumcision. The
   argument is taken from the economy [374] which God has appointed; for
   those who retain circumcision contrive a mode of dispensation different
   from that which God has appointed.

   When he says that we are buried with Christ, this means more than that
   we are crucified with him; for burial expresses a continued process of
   mortification. When he says, that this is done through means of
   baptism, as he says also in Romans 6:4, he speaks in his usual manner,
   ascribing efficacy to the sacrament, that it may not fruitlessly
   signify what does not exist. [375] By baptism, therefore, we are buried
   with Christ, because Christ does at the same time accomplish
   efficaciously that mortification, which he there represents, that the
   reality may be conjoined with the sign.

   In which also ye are risen. He magnifies the grace which we obtain in
   Christ, as being greatly superior to circumcision. "We are not only,"
   says he, "ingrafted into Christ's death, but we also rise to newness of
   life:" hence the more injury is done to Christ by those who endeavor to
   bring us back to circumcision. He adds, by faith, for unquestionably it
   is by it that we receive what is presented to us in baptism. But what
   faith? That of his efficacy or operation, by which he means, that faith
   is founded upon the power of God. As, however, faith does not wander in
   a confused and undefined contemplation, as they speak, of divine power,
   he intimates what efficacy it ought to have in view -- that by which
   God raised Christ from the dead. He takes this, however, for granted,
   that, inasmuch as it is impossible that believers should be severed
   from their head, the same power of God, which shewed itself in Christ,
   is diffused among them all in common.

   Colossians 2:13-15

   13. And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your
   flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all
   trespasses;

   13. Et vos, quum mortui essetis delictis et in praeputio carnis
   vestrae, simul vivificavit cum ipso, condonando vobis omnia peccata:

   14. Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us,
   which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his
   cross;

   14. Et deleto, quod contra nos erat, chirographo in decretis, quod erat
   nobis contrarium, et illud sustulit e medio affixum cruci,

   15 And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them
   openly, triumphing over them in it.

   15. Exspolians principatus et potestates, traduxit palam triumphans de
   his in illa, (vel, in se ipso.)


   13. And you, when ye were dead. He admonishes the Colossians to
   recognize, what he had treated of in a general way, as applicable to
   themselves, which is by far the most effectual way of teaching.
   Farther, as they were Gentiles when they were converted to Christ, he
   takes occasion from this to shew them how absurd it is to pass over
   from Christ to the ceremonies of Moses. Ye were, says he, dead in
   Uncircumcision. This term, however, may be understood either in its
   proper signification, or figuratively. If you understand it in its
   proper sense, the meaning will be, "Uncircumcision is the badge of
   alienation from God; for where the covenant of grace is not, there is
   pollution, [376] and, consequently, curse and ruin. But God has called
   you to himself from uncircumcision, and, therefore, from death." [377]
   In this way he would not represent uncircumcision as the cause of
   death, but as a token that they were estranged from God. We know,
   however, that men cannot live otherwise than by cleaving to their God,
   who alone is their life. Hence it follows, that all wicked persons,
   however they may seem to themselves to be in the highest degree lively
   and flourishing, are, nevertheless, spiritually dead. In this manner
   this passage will correspond with Ephesians 2:11, where it is said,

   Remember that, in time past, when ye were Gentiles, and called
   uncircumcision, by that circumcision which is made with hands in the
   flesh, ye were at that time without Christ, alienated from the
   commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the promises.

   Taking it metaphorically, there would, indeed, be an allusion to
   natural uncircumcision, but at the same time Paul would here be
   speaking of the obstinacy of the human heart, in opposition to God, and
   of a nature that is defiled by corrupt affections. I rather prefer the
   former exposition, because it corresponds better with the context; for
   Paul declares that uncircumcision was no hinderance in the way of their
   becoming partakers of Christ's life. Hence it follows, that
   circumcision derogated from the grace of God, which they had already
   obtained.

   As to his ascribing death to uncircumcision, this is not as though it
   were the cause of it, but as being the badge of it, as also in that
   other passage in the Epistle to the Ephesians, which we have quoted. It
   is also customary in Scripture to denote deprivation of the reality by
   deprivation of the sign, as in Genesis 3:22, --

   Lest peradventure Adam eat of the fruit of life, and live.

   For the tree did not confer life, but its being taken away was a sign
   of death. [378] Paul has in this place briefly expressed both. He says
   that these were dead in sins: this is the cause, for our sins alienate
   us from God. He adds, in the uncircumcision of your flesh. This was
   outward pollution, an evidence of spiritual death.

   By forgiving you. God does not quicken us by the mere remission of
   sins, but he makes mention here of this particularly, because that free
   reconciliation with God, which overthrows the righteousness of works,
   is especially connected with the point in hand, where he treats of
   abrogated ceremonies, as he discourses of more at large in the Epistle
   to the Galatians. For the false apostles, by establishing ceremonies,
   bound them with a halter, from which Christ has set them free.

   14. Having blotted out the hand-writing which was against us. He now
   contends with the false apostles in close combat. For this was the main
   point in question, -- whether the observance of ceremonies was
   necessary under the reign of Christ? Now Paul contends that ceremonies
   have been abolished, and to prove this he compares them to a
   hand-writing, by which God holds us as it were bound, that we may not
   be able to deny our guilt. He now says, that we have been freed from
   condemnation, in such a manner, that even the hand-writing is blotted
   out, that no remembrance of it might remain. For we know that as to
   debts the obligation is still in force, so long as the hand-writing
   remains; and that, on the other hand, by the erasing, or tearing of the
   handwriting, the debtor is set free. Hence it follows, that all those
   who still urge the observance of ceremonies, detract from the grace of
   Christ, as though absolution were not procured for us through him; for
   they restore to the hand-writing its freshness, so as to hold us still
   under obligation.

   This, therefore, is a truly theological reason for proving the
   abrogation of ceremonies, because, if Christ has fully redeemed us from
   condemnation, he must have also effaced the remembrance of the
   obligation, that consciences may be pacified and tranquil in the sight
   of God, for these two things are conjoined. While interpreters explain
   this passage in various ways, there is not one of them that satisfies
   me. Some think that Paul speaks simply of the moral law, but there is
   no ground for this. For Paul is accustomed to give the name of
   ordinances to that department which consists in ceremonies, as he does
   in the Epistle to the Ephesians, (Ephesians 2:15,) and as we shall find
   he does shortly afterwards. More especially, the passage in Ephesians
   shews clearly, that Paul is here speaking of ceremonies.

   Others, therefore, do better, in restricting it to ceremonies, but
   they, too, err in this respect, that they do not add the reason why it
   is called hand-writing, or rather they assign a reason different from
   the true one, and they do not in a proper manner apply this similitude
   to the context. Now, the reason is, that all the ceremonies of Moses
   had in them some acknowledgment of guilt, which bound those that
   observed them with a firmer tie, as it were, in the view of God's
   judgment. For example, what else were washings than an evidence of
   pollution? Whenever any victim was sacrificed, did not the people that
   stood by behold in it a representation of his death? For when persons
   substituted in their place an innocent animal, they confessed that they
   were themselves deserving of that death. In fine, in proportion as
   there were ceremonies belonging to it, just so many exhibitions were
   there of human guilt, and hand-writings of obligation.

   Should any one object that they were sacraments of the grace of God, as
   Baptism and the Eucharist are to us at this day, the answer is easy.
   For there are two things to be considered in the ancient ceremonies --
   that they were suited to the time, and that they led men forward to the
   kingdom of Christ. Whatever was done at that time shewed in itself
   nothing but obligation. Grace was in a manner suspended until the
   advent of Christ -- not that the Fathers were excluded from it, but
   they had not a present manifestation of it in their ceremonies. For
   they saw nothing in the sacrifices but the blood of beasts, and in
   their washings nothing but water. Hence, as to present view,
   condemnation remained; nay more, the ceremonies themselves sealed the
   condemnation. The Apostle speaks, also, in this manner in the whole of
   his Epistle to the Hebrews, because he places Christ in direct
   opposition to ceremonies. But how is it now? The Son of God has not
   only by his death delivered us from the condemnation of death, but in
   order that absolution might be made more certain, he abrogated those
   ceremonies, that no remembrance of obligation might remain. This is
   full liberty -- that Christ has by his blood not only blotted out our
   sins, but every hand-writing which might declare us to be exposed to
   the judgment of God. Erasmus in his version has involved in confusion
   the thread of Paul's discourse, by rendering it thus -- "which was
   contrary to us by ordinances." Retain, therefore, the rendering which I
   have given, as being the true and genuine one.

   Took it out of the way, fastening it to his cross. He shews the manner
   in which Christ has effaced the hand-writing; for as he fastened to the
   cross our curse, our sins, and also the punishment that was due to us,
   so he has also fastened to it that bondage of the law, and everything
   that tends to bind consciences. For, on his being fastened to the
   cross, he took all things to himself, and even bound them upon him,
   that they might have no more power over us.

   15. Spoiling principalities. There is no doubt that he means devils,
   whom Scripture represents as acting the part of accusing us before God.
   Paul, however, says that they are disarmed, so that they cannot bring
   forward anything against us, the attestation of our guilt being itself
   destroyed. Now, he expressly adds this with the view of shewing, that
   the victory of Christ, which he has procured for himself and us over
   Satan, is disfigured by the false apostles, and that we are deprived of
   the fruit of it when they restore the ancient ceremonies. For if our
   liberty is the spoil which Christ has rescued from the devil, what do
   others, who would bring us back into bondage, but restore to Satan the
   spoils of which he had been stript bare?

   Triumphing over them in it. The expression in the Greek allows, it is
   true, of our reading -- in himself; nay more, the greater part of the
   manuscripts have en hauto with an aspirate. The connection of the
   passage, however, imperatively requires that we read it otherwise; for
   what would be meagre as applied to Christ, suits admirably as applied
   to the cross. For as he had previously compared the cross to a signal
   trophy or show of triumph, in which Christ led about his enemies, so he
   now also compares it to a triumphal car, in which he shewed himself
   conspicuously to view. [379] For although in the cross there is nothing
   but curse, it was, nevertheless, swallowed up by the power of God in
   such a way, that it [380] has put on, as it were, a new nature. For
   there is no tribunal so magnificent, no throne so stately, no show of
   triumph so distinguished, no chariot so elevated, [381] as is the
   gibbet on which Christ has subdued death and the devil, the prince of
   death; nay more, has utterly trodden them under his feet.

   Colossians 2:16-19

   16. Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect
   of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath-days:

   16. Itaque ne quis vos iudicet [382] vel in cibo, vel in potu, vel in
   parte [383] diei festi, vel neomeniae, vel sabbatorum:

   17. Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.

   17. Quae sunt umbra futurorum, corpus autem Christi.

   18. Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and
   worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not
   seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,

   18. Ne quis palmam eripiat, volens in humilitate et cultu Angelorum,
   (id facere,) in ea quae non vidit se ingerens, frustra inflatus a mente
   carnis suae,

   19. And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and
   bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with
   the increase of God.

   19. Et non tenens caput, ex quo totum corpus per iuncturas et
   connexiones subministratum et compactum crescit increments Dei.


   16. Let no one therefore judge you. What he had previously said of
   circumcision he now extends to the difference of meats and days. For
   circumcision was the first introduction to the observance of the law,
   other things [384] followed afterwards. To judge means here, to hold
   one to be guilty of a crime, or to impose a scruple of conscience, so
   that we are no longer free. He says, therefore, that it is not in the
   power of men to make us subject to the observance of rites which Christ
   has by his death abolished, and exempts us from their yoke, that we may
   not allow ourselves to be fettered by the laws which they have imposed.
   He tacitly, however, places Christ in contrast with all mankind, lest
   any one should extol himself so daringly as to attempt to take away
   what he has given him.

   In respect of a festival-day. Some understand to meros to mean
   participation. Chrysostom, accordingly, thinks that he used the term
   part, because they did not observe all festival days, nor did they even
   keep holidays strictly, in accordance with the appointment of the law.
   This, however, is but a poor interpretation. [385] Consider whether it
   may not be taken to mean separation, for those that make a distinction
   of days, separate, as it were, one from another. Such a mode of
   partition was suitable for the Jews, that they might celebrate
   religiously [386] the days that were appointed, by separating them from
   others. Among Christians, however, such a division has ceased.

   But some one will say, "We still keep up some observance of days." I
   answer, that we do not by any means observe days, as though there were
   any sacredness in holidays, or as though it were not lawful to labor
   upon them, but that respect is paid to government and order -- not to
   days. And this is what he immediately adds.

   17. Which are a shadow of things to come. The reason why he frees
   Christians from the observance of them is, that they were shadows at a
   time when Christ was still, in a manner, absent. For he contrasts
   shadows with revelation, and absence with manifestation. Those,
   therefore, who still adhere to those shadows, act like one who should
   judge of a man's appearance from his shadow, while in the mean time he
   had himself personally before his eyes. For Christ is now manifested to
   us, and hence we enjoy him as being present. The body, says he, is of
   Christ, that is, IN Christ. For the substance of those things which the
   ceremonies anciently prefigured is now presented before our eyes in
   Christ, inasmuch as he contains in himself everything that they marked
   out as future. Hence, the man that calls back the ceremonies into use,
   either buries the manifestation of Christ, or robs Christ of his
   excellence, and makes him in a manner void. [387] Accordingly, should
   any one of mortals assume to himself in this matter the office of
   judge, let us not submit to him, inasmuch as Christ, the only competent
   Judge, sets us free. For when he says, Let no man judge you, he does
   not address the false apostles, but prohibits the Colossians from
   yielding their neck to unreasonable requirements. To abstain, it is
   true, from swine's flesh, is in itself harmless, but the binding to do
   it is pernicious, because it makes void the grace of Christ.

   Should any one ask, "What view, then, is to be taken of our sacraments?
   Do they not also represent Christ to us as absent?" I answer, that they
   differ widely from the ancient ceremonies. For as painters do not in
   the first draught bring out a likeness in vivid colors, and (eikonikos)
   expressively, but in the first instance draw rude and obscure lines
   with charcoal, so the representation of Christ under the law was
   unpolished, and was, as it were, a first sketch, but in our sacraments
   it is seen drawn out to the life. Paul, however, had something farther
   in view, for he contrasts the bare aspect of the shadow with the
   solidity of the body, and admonishes them, that it is the part of a
   madman to take hold of empty shadows, when it is in his power to handle
   the solid substance. Farther, while our sacraments represent Christ as
   absent as to view and distance of place, it is in such a manner as to
   testify that he has been once manifested, and they now also present him
   to us to be enjoyed. They are not, therefore, bare shadows, but on the
   contrary symbols [388] of Christ's presence, for they contain that Yea
   and Amen of all the promises of God, (2 Corinthians 1:20,) which has
   been once manifested to us in Christ.

   18. Let no one take from you the palm. [389] He alludes to runners, or
   wrestlers, to whom the palm was assigned, on condition of their not
   giving way in the middle of the course, or after the contest had been
   commenced. He admonishes them, therefore, that the false apostles aimed
   at nothing else than to snatch away from them the palm, inasmuch as
   they draw them aside from the rectitude of their course. Hence it
   follows that they must be shunned as the most injurious pests. The
   passage is also carefully to be marked as intimating, that all those
   who draw us aside from the simplicity of Christ cheat us out of the
   prize of our high calling. (Philippians 3:14.)

   Desirous in humility. Something must be understood; hence I have,
   inserted in the text id facere, (to do it.) For he points out the kind
   of danger which they required to guard against. All are desirous to
   defraud you of the palm, who, under the pretext of humility, recommend
   to you the worship of angels. For their object is, that you may wander
   out of the way, leaving the one object of aim. I read humility and
   worship of angels conjointly, for the one follows the other, just as at
   this day the Papists make use of the same pretext when philosophizing
   as to the worship of saints. For they reason on the ground of man's
   abasement, [390] that we must, therefore, seek for mediators to help
   us. But for this very reason has Christ humbled himself -- that we
   might directly betake ourselves to him, however miserable sinners we
   may be.

   I am aware that the worship of angels is by many interpreted otherwise,
   as meaning such as has been delivered to men by angels; for the Devil
   has always endeavored to set off his impostures under this title. The
   Pope at this day boasts, that all the trifles with which he has
   adulterated the pure worship of God are revelations. In like manner the
   Theurgians [391] of old alleged that all the superstitions that they
   contrived were delivered over to them by angels, as if from hand to
   hand. [392] They, accordingly, think that Paul here condemns all
   fanciful kinds of worship that are falsely set forth under the
   authority of angels. [393] But, in my opinion, he rather condemns the
   contrivance as to the worshipping of angels. It is on this account that
   he has so carefully applied himself to this in the very commencement of
   the Epistle, to bring angels under subjection, lest they should obscure
   the splendor of Christ. [394] In fine, as he had in the first chapter
   prepared the way for abolishing the ceremonies, so he had also for the
   removal of all other hinderances which draw us away from Christ alone.
   [395] In this class is the worship of angels

   Superstitious persons have from the beginning worshipped angels, [396]
   that through means of them there might be free access to God. The
   Platonists infected the Christian Church also with this error. For
   although Augustine sharply inveighs against them in his tenth book "On
   the City of God," and condemns at great length all their disputations
   as to the worship of angels, we see nevertheless what has happened.
   Should any one compare the writings of Plato with Popish theology, he
   will find that they have drawn wholly from Plato their prattling as to
   the worship of angels. The sum is this, that we must honor angels, whom
   Plato calls demons, charin tos euphemou diaporeias (for the sake of
   their auspicious intercession.) [397] He brings forward this sentiment
   in Epinomis, and he confirms it in Cratylus, [398] and many other
   passages. In what respect do the Papists differ at all from this?
   "But," it will be said, "they do not deny that the Son of God is
   Mediator." Neither did those with whom Paul contends; but as they
   imagined that God must be approached by the assistance of the angels,
   and that, consequently, some worship must be rendered to them, so they
   placed angels in the seat of Christ, and honored them with Christ's
   office. Let us know, then, that Paul here condemns all kinds of worship
   of human contrivance, which are rendered either to angels or to the
   dead, as though they were mediators, rendering assistance after Christ,
   or along with Christ. [399] For just so far do we recede from Christ,
   when we transfer the smallest part of what belongs to him to any
   others, whether they be angels or men.

   Intruding into those things which he hath not seen. The verb
   embateuein, the participle of which Paul here makes use of, has various
   significations. The rendering which Erasmus, after Jerome, has given to
   it, walking proudly, would not suit ill, were there an example of such
   a signification in any author of sufficient note. For we see every day
   with how much confidence and pride rash persons pronounce an opinion as
   to things unknown. Nay, even in the very subject of which Paul treats,
   there is a remarkable illustration. For when the Sorbonnic divines put
   forth their trifles [400] respecting the intercession of saints or
   angels, they declare, [401] as though it were from an oracle, [402]
   that the dead [403] know and behold our necessities, inasmuch as they
   see all things in the reflex light of God. [404] And yet, what is less
   certain? Nay more, what is more obscure and doubtful? But such, truly,
   is their magisterial freedom, that they fearlessly and daringly assert
   what is not only not known by them, but cannot be known by men.

   This meaning, therefore, would be suitable, if that signification of
   the term were usual. It is, however, among the Greeks taken simply as
   meaning to walk. It also sometimes means to inquire. Should any one
   choose to understand it thus in this passage, Paul will, in that case,
   reprove a foolish curiosity in the investigation of things that are
   obscure, and such as are even hid from our view and transcend it. [405]
   It appears to me, however, that I have caught Paul's meaning, and have
   rendered it faithfully in this manner -- intruding into those things
   which he hath not seen. For that is the common signification of the
   word embateuein -- to enter upon an inheritance, [406] or to take
   possession, or to set foot anywhere. Accordingly, Budaeus renders this
   passage thus: -- "Setting foot upon, or entering on the possession of
   those things which he has not seen." I have followed his authority, but
   have selected a more suitable term. For such persons in reality break
   through and intrude into secret things, [407] of which God would have
   no discovery as yet made to us. The passage ought to be carefully
   observed, for the purpose of reproving the rashness [408] of those who
   inquire farther than is allowable.

   Puffed up in vain by a fleshly mind. He employs the expression fleshly
   mind to denote the perspicuity of the human intellect, however great it
   may be. For he places it in contrast with that spiritual wisdom which
   is revealed to us from heaven in accordance with that statement --

   Flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee.
   (Matthew 16:17.)

   Whoever; therefore, depends upon his own reason, inasmuch as the
   acuteness of the flesh is wholly at work in him, [409] Paul declares
   him to be puffed up in vain. And truly all the wisdom that men have
   from themselves is mere wind: hence there is nothing solid except in
   the word of God and the illumination of the Spirit. And observe, that
   those are said to be puffed up who insinuate themselves [410] under a
   show of humility. For it happens, as Augustine elegantly writes to
   Paulinus, by wonderful means, as to the soul of man, that it is more
   puffed up from a false humility than if it were openly proud.

   19. Not holding the Head. He condemns in the use of one word whatever
   does not bear a relation to Christ. He also confirms his statement on
   the ground that all things flow from him, and depend upon him. Hence,
   should any one call us anywhere else than to Christ, though in other
   respects he were big with heaven and earth, he is empty and full of
   wind: let us, therefore, without concern, bid him farewell. Observe,
   however, of whom he is speaking, namely, of those who did not openly
   reject or deny Christ, but, not accurately understanding his office and
   power, by seeking out other helps and means of salvation, (as they
   commonly speak,) were not firmly rooted in him.

   From whom the whole body by joints. He simply means this, that the
   Church does not stand otherwise than in the event of all things being
   furnished to her by Christ, the Head, and, accordingly, that her entire
   safety [411] consists in him. The body, it is true, has its nerves, its
   joints, and ligaments, but all these things derive their vigor solely
   from the Head, so that the whole binding of them together is from that
   source. What, then, must be done? The constitution of the body will be
   in a right state, if simply the Head, which furnishes the several
   members with everything that they have, is allowed, without any
   hinderance, to have the pre-eminence. This Paul speaks of as the
   increase of God, by which he means that it is not every increase that
   is approved by God, but only that which has a relation to the Head. For
   we see that the kingdom of the Pope is not merely tall and large, but
   swells out into a monstrous size. As, however, we do not there see what
   Paul here requires in the Church, what shall we say, but that it is a
   humpbacked body, and a confused mass that will fall to pieces of
   itself.

   Colossians 2:20-23

   20. Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the
   world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to
   ordinances,

   20. Si igitur mortui estis cum Christo ab elementis huius mundi, quid
   tanquam viventibus in mundo decreta vobis perscribuntur?

   21. (Touch not; taste not; handle not;

   21. Ne esitaveris, ne gustaveris, ne attigeris:

   22. Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and
   doctrines of men?

   22. Quae sunt omnia in corruptionem ipso abusu, secundum praecepta et
   doctrines hominum,

   23. Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and
   humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the
   satisfying of the flesh.

   23. Quae speciem [412] quidem habent sapientiae in superstitione, [413]
   et humilitate animi, et neglectu corporis: [414] non in honore aliquo
   ad expletionem carnis. [415]


   20. If ye are dead. He had previously said, that the ordinances were
   fastened to the cross of Christ. (Colossians 2:14.) He now employs
   another figure of speech -- that we are dead to them, as he teaches us
   elsewhere, that we are dead to the law, and the law, on the other hand,
   to us. (Galatians 2:19.) The term death means abrogation, [416] but it
   is more expressive and more emphatic, (kai emphatikoteron.) He says,
   therefore, that the Colossians, have nothing to do with ordinances.
   Why? Because they have died with Christ to ordinances; that is, after
   they died with Christ by regeneration, they were, through his kindness,
   set free from ordinances, that they may not belong to them any more.
   Hence he concludes that they are by no means bound by the ordinances,
   which the false apostles endeavored to impose upon them.

   21. Eat not, taste not. Hitherto this has been rendered -- Handle not,
   but as another word immediately follows, which signifies the same
   thing, every one sees how cold and absurd were such a repetition.
   Farther, the verb haptesthai is employed by the Greeks, among its other
   significations, in the sense of eating, [417] in accordance with the
   rendering that I have given. Plutarch makes use of it in the life of
   Caesar, when he relates that his soldiers, in destitution of all
   things, ate animals which they had not been accustomed previously to
   use as food. [418] And this arrangement is both in other respects
   natural and is also most in accordance with the connection of the
   passage; for Paul points out, (mimetikos,) by way of imitation, to what
   length the waywardness of those who bind consciences by their laws is
   wont to proceed. From the very commencement they are unduly rigorous:
   hence he sets out with their prohibition -- not simply against eating,
   but even against slightly partaking. After they have obtained what they
   wish they go beyond that command, so that they afterwards declare it to
   be unlawful to taste of what they do not wish should be eaten. At
   length they make it criminal even to touch. In short, when persons have
   once taken upon them to tyrannize over men's souls, there is no end of
   new laws being daily added to old ones, and new enactments starting up
   from time to time. How bright a mirror there is as to this in Popery!
   Hence Paul acts admirably well in admonishing us that human traditions
   are a labyrinth, in which consciences are more and more entangled; nay
   more, are snares, which from the beginning bind in such a way that in
   course of time they strangle in the end.

   22. All which things tend to corruption. He sets aside, by a twofold
   argument, the enactments of which he has made mention -- because they
   make religion consist in things outward and frail, which have no
   connection with the spiritual kingdom of God; and secondly, because
   they are from men, not from God. He combats the first argument, also,
   in Romans 14:17, when he says,

   The kingdom of God is not in meat and drink;

   likewise in 1 Corinthians. 6 13,

   Meat for the belly, and the belly for meats: God will destroy both.

   Christ also himself says,

   Whatever entereth into the mouth defileth not the man, because it goes
   down into the belly, and is cast forth.
   (Matthew 15:11.)

   The sum is this -- that the worship of God, true piety, and the
   holiness of Christians, do not consist in drink, and food, and
   clothing, which are things that are transient and liable to corruption,
   and perish by abuse. For abuse is properly applicable to those things
   which are corrupted by the use of them. Hence enactments are of no
   value in reference to those things which tend to excite scruples of
   conscience. But in Popery you would scarcely find any other holiness,
   than what consists in little observances of corruptible things.

   A second refutation is added [419] -- that they originated with men,
   and have not God as their Author; and by this thunderbolt he prostrates
   and swallows up all traditions of men. For why? This is Paul's
   reasoning: "Those who bring consciences into bondage do injury to
   Christ, and make void his death. For whatever is of human invention
   does not bind conscience."

   23. Which have indeed a show. Here we have the anticipation of an
   objection, in which, while he concedes to his adversaries what they
   allege, he at the same time reckons it wholly worthless. For it is as
   though he had said, that he does not regard their having a show of
   wisdom. But show is placed in contrast with reality, for it is an
   appearance, as they commonly speak, which deceives by resemblance.
   [420]

   Observe, however, of what colors this show consists, according to Paul.
   He makes mention of three -- self-invented worship, [421] humility, and
   neglect of the body. Superstition among the Greeks receives the name of
   ethelobreskeia -- the term which Paul here makes use of. He has,
   however, an eye to the etymology of the term, for ethelobreskeia
   literally denotes a voluntary service, which men choose for themselves
   at their own option, without authority from God. Human traditions,
   therefore, are agreeable to us on this account, that they are in
   accordance with our understanding, for any one will find in his own
   brain the first outlines of them. This is the first pretext.

   The second is humility, inasmuch as obedience both to God and men is
   pretended, so that men do not refuse even unreasonable burdens. [422]
   And for the most part traditions of this kind are of such a nature as
   to appear to be admirable exercises of humility.

   They allure, also, by means of a third pretext, inasmuch as they seem
   to be of the greatest avail for the mortification of the flesh, while
   there is no sparing of the body. Paul, however, bids farewell to those
   disguises, for

   what is in high esteem among men is often an abomination in the sight
   of God. (Luke 16:15.)

   Farther, that is a treacherous obedience, and a perverse and
   sacrilegious humility, which transfers to men the authority of God; and
   neglect of the body is not of so great importance, as to be worthy to
   be set forth to admiration as the service of God.

   Some one, however, will feel astonished, that Paul does not take more
   pains in pulling off those masks. I answer, that he on good grounds
   rests contented with the simple term show. For the principles which he
   had taken as opposed to this are incontrovertible -- that the body is
   in Christ, and that, consequently, those do nothing but impose upon
   miserable men, who set before them shadows. Secondly, the spiritual
   kingdom of Christ is by no means taken up with frail and corruptible
   elements. Thirdly, by the death of Christ such observances were put an
   end to, that we might have no connection with them; and, fourthly, God
   is our only Lawgiver. (Isaiah 33:22.) Whatever may be brought forward
   on the other side, let it have ever so much splendor, is fleeting show.

   Secondly, he reckoned it enough to admonish the Colossians, not to be
   deceived by the putting forth of empty things. There was no necessity
   for dwelling at greater length in reproving them. For it should be a
   settled point among all the pious, that the worship of God ought not to
   be measured according to our views; and that, consequently, any kind of
   service is not lawful, simply on the ground that it is agreeable to us.
   This, also, ought to be a commonly received point -- that we owe to God
   such humility as to yield obedience simply to his commands, so as not
   to lean to our own understanding, etc., (Proverbs 3:5,) -- and that the
   limit of humility towards men is this -- that each one submit himself
   to others in love. Now, when they contend that the wantonness of the
   flesh is repressed by abstinence from meats, the answer is easy -- that
   we must not therefore abstain from any particular food as being
   unclean, but must eat sparingly of what we do eat of, both in order
   that we may soberly and temperately make use of the gifts of God, and
   that we may not, impeded by too much food and drink, forget those
   things that are God's. Hence it was enough to say that these [423] were
   masks, that the Colossians, being warned, might be on their guard
   against false pretexts.

   Thus, at the present day, Papists are not in want of specious pretexts,
   by which to set forth their own laws, however they may be -- some of
   them impious and tyrannical, and others of them silly and trifling.
   When, however, we have granted them everything, there remains,
   nevertheless, this refutation by Paul, which is of itself more than
   sufficient for dispelling all their smoky vapours; [424] not to say how
   far removed they [425] are from so honorable an appearance as that
   which Paul describes. The principal holiness of the Papacy, [426] at
   the present day, consists in monkhood, and of what nature that is, I am
   ashamed and grieved to make mention, lest I should stir up so
   abominable an odour. Farther, it is of importance to consider here, how
   prone, nay, how forward the mind of man is to artificial modes of
   worship. For the Apostle here graphically describes [427] the state of
   the old system of monkhood, which came into use a hundred years after
   his death, as though he had never spoken a word. The zeal of men,
   therefore, for superstition is surpassingly mad, which could not be
   restrained by so plain a declaration of God from breaking forth, as
   historical records testify.

   Not in any honor. Honor means care, according to the usage of the
   Hebrew tongue. Honour widows, (1 Timothy 5:3,) that is, take care of
   them. Now Paul finds fault with this, that they [428] teach to leave
   off care for the body. For as God forbids us to indulge the body
   unduly, so he commands that these be given it as much as is necessary
   for it. Hence Paul, in Romans 13:14, does not expressly condemn care
   for the flesh, but such as indulges lusts. Have no care, says he, for
   the flesh, to the gratifying of its lusts. What, then, does Paul point
   out as faulty in those traditions of which he treats? It is that they
   gave no honor to the body for the satisfying the flesh, that is,
   according to the measure of necessity. For satisfying here means a
   mediocrity, which restricts itself to the simple use of nature, and
   thus stands in opposition to pleasure and all superfluous delicacies;
   for nature is content with little. Hence, to refuse what it requires
   for sustaining the necessity of life, is not less at variance with
   piety, than it is inhuman.

   CHAPTER 3
     __________________________________________________________________

   Colossians 3:1-4

   1. If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above,
   where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.

   1. Ergo si consurrexistis cum Christo, quae sursum sunt quaerite, ubi
   Christus est in dextera Dei sedens:

   2. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.

   2. Quae sursum sunt cogitate, non quae super terram.

   3. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.

   3. Mortui enim estis, et vita nostra abscondita est cum Christo in Deo.

   4. When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also
   appear with him in glory.

   4. Ubi autem Christus apparuerit, vita vestra, tunc etiam vos cum ipso
   apparebitis in gloria.


   To those fruitless exercises which the false apostles urged, [429] as
   though perfection consisted in them, he opposes those true exercises in
   which it becomes Christians to employ themselves; and this has no
   slight bearing upon the point in hand; for when we see what God would
   have us do, we afterwards easily despise the inventions of men. When we
   perceive, too, that what God recommends to us is much more lofty and
   excellent than what men inculcate, our alacrity of mind increases for
   following God, so as to disregard men. Paul here exhorts the Colossians
   to meditation upon the heavenly life. And what as to his opponents?
   They were desirous to retain their childish rudiments. This doctrine,
   therefore, makes the ceremonies be the more lightly esteemed. Hence it
   is manifest that Paul, in this passage, exhorts in such a manner as to
   confirm the foregoing doctrine; for, in describing solid piety and
   holiness of life, his aim is, that those vain shows of human traditions
   may vanish. [430] At the same time, he anticipates an objection with
   which the false apostles might assail him. What then? "Wouldst thou
   rather have men be idle than addict themselves to such exercises, of
   whatever sort they may be?" When, therefore, he bids Christians apply
   themselves to exercises of a greatly superior kind, he cuts off the
   handle for this calumny; nay more, he loads them with no small odium,
   on the ground that they impede the right course of the pious by
   worthless amusements. [431]

   1. If ye are risen with Christ. Ascension follows resurrection: hence,
   if we are the members of Christ we must ascend into heaven, because he,
   on being raised up from the dead, was received up into heaven, (Mark
   16:19,) that he might draw us up with him. Now, we seek those things
   which are above, when in our minds [432] we are truly sojourners in
   this world, and are not bound to it. The word rendered think upon
   expresses rather assiduity and intensity of aim: "Let your whole
   meditation be as to this: to this apply your intellect -- to this your
   mind." But if we ought to think of nothing but of what is heavenly,
   because Christ is in heaven, how much less becoming were it to seek
   Christ upon the earth. Let us therefore bear in mind that that is a
   true and holy thinking as to Christ, which forthwith bears us up into
   heaven, that we may there adore him, and that our minds may dwell with
   him.

   As to the right hand of God, it is not confined to heaven, but fills
   the whole world. Paul has made mention of it here to intimate that
   Christ encompasses us by his power, that we may not think that distance
   of place is a cause of separation between us and him, and that at the
   same time his majesty may excite us wholly to reverence him.

   2. Not the things that are on earth. He does not mean, as he does a
   little afterwards, depraved appetites, which reign in earthly men, nor
   even riches, or fields, or houses, nor any other things of the present
   life, which we must

   use, as though we did not use them,
   (1 Corinthians 7:30, 31) [433]

   but is still following out his discussion as to ceremonies, which he
   represents as resembling entanglements which constrain us to creep upon
   the ground. "Christ," says he, "calls us upwards to himself, while
   these draw us downwards." For this is the winding-up and exposition of
   what he had lately touched upon as to the abolition of ceremonies
   through the death of Christ. "The ceremonies are dead to you through
   the death of Christ, and you to them, in order that, being raised up to
   heaven with Christ, you may think only of those things that are above.
   Leave off therefore earthly things." I shall not contend against others
   who are of a different mind; but certainly the Apostle appears to me to
   go on step by step, so that, in the first instance, he places
   traditions as to trivial matters in contrast with meditation on the
   heavenly life, and afterwards, as we shall see, goes a step farther.

   3. For ye are dead. No one can rise again with Christ, if he has not
   first died with him. Hence he draws an argument from rising again to
   dying, as from a consequent to an antecedent, [434] meaning that we
   must be dead to the world that we may live to Christ. Why has he
   taught, that we must seek those things that are above? It is because
   the life of the pious is above. Why does he now teach, that the things
   which are on earth are to be left off? Because they are dead to the
   world. "Death goes before that resurrection, of which I have spoken.
   Hence both of them must be seen in you."

   It is worthy of observation, that our life is said to be hid, that we
   may not murmur or complain if our life, being buried under the ignominy
   of the cross, and under various distresses, differs nothing from death,
   but may patiently wait for the day of revelation. And in order that our
   waiting may not be painful, let us observe those expressions, in God,
   and with Christ, which intimate that our life is out of danger,
   although it does not appear. For, in the first place, God is faithful,
   and therefore will not deny what has been committed to him, (2 Timothy
   1:12,) nor deceive in the guardianship which he has undertaken; and,
   secondly, the fellowship of Christ brings still greater security. For
   what is to be more desired by us than this -- that our life remain with
   the very fountain of life. Hence there is no reason why we should be
   alarmed if, on looking around on every side, we nowhere see life. For
   we are

   saved by hope. But those things which are already seen with our eyes
   are not hoped for. (Romans 8:24.)

   Nor does he teach that our life is hid merely in the opinion of the
   world, but even as to our own view, because this is the true and
   necessary trial of our hope, that being encompassed, as it were, with
   death, we may seek life somewhere else than in the world.

   4. But when Christ, our life, shall appear. Here we have a choice
   consolation -- that the coming of Christ will be the manifestation of
   our life. And, at the same time, he admonishes us how unreasonable were
   the disposition of the man, who should refuse to bear up [435] until
   that day. For if our life is shut up in Christ, it must be hid, until
   he shall appear

   Colossians 3:5-8

   5. Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth;
   fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and
   covetousness, which is idolatry:

   5. Mortificate igitur membra vestra, quae sunt super terram,
   scortationem, immunditiem, mollitiem, concupiscentiam malam, et
   avaritiam, quae est idololatria.

   6. For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of
   disobedience:

   6. Propter quae venit ira Dei in filios inobedientiae;

   7. In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.

   7. In quibus vos quoque ambulabatis aliquando, quum viveretis in illis.

   8. But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy,
   filthy communication out of your mouth.

   8. Nunc autem deponite et vos omnia, iram, indignationem, malitiam,
   maledicentiam, turpiloquentiam ex ore vestro.


   5. Mortify therefore. Hitherto he has been speaking of contempt of the
   world. He now proceeds further, and enters upon a higher philosophy, as
   to the mortification of the flesh. That this may be the better
   understood, let us take notice that there is a twofold mortification.
   The former relates to those things that are around us. Of this he has
   hitherto treated. The other is inward -- that of the understanding and
   will, and of the whole of our corrupt nature. He makes mention of
   certain vices which he calls, not with strict accuracy, but at the same
   time elegantly, members. For he conceives of our nature as being, as it
   were, a mass made up of different vices. They are, therefore, our
   members, inasmuch as they in a manner stick close to us. He calls them
   also earthly, alluding to what he had said -- not the things that are
   on earth, (Colossians 3:2,) but in a different sense. "I have
   admonished you, that earthly things are to be disregarded: you must,
   however, make it your aim to mortify those vices which detain you on
   the earth." He intimates, however, that we are earthly, so long as the
   vices of our flesh are vigorous in us, and that we are made heavenly by
   the renewing of the Spirit.

   After fornication he adds uncleanness, by which term he expresses all
   kinds of wantonness, by which lascivious persons pollute themselves. To
   these is added, pathos that is, lust, which includes all the
   allurements of unhallowed desire. This term, it is true, denotes mental
   perturbations of other kinds, and disorderly motions contrary to
   reason; but lust is not an unsuitable rendering of this passage. As to
   the reason why covetousness is here spoken of as a worshipping of
   images, [436] consult the [39]Epistle to the Ephesians, that I may not
   say the same thing twice.

   6. On account of which things the wrath of God cometh. I do not find
   fault with the rendering of Erasmus -- solet venire -- (is wont to
   come,) but as the present tense is often taken in Scripture instead of
   the future, according to the idiom of the Hebrew language, I have
   preferred to leave the rendering undecided, so that it might be
   accommodated to either meaning. He warns the Colossians, then, either
   of the ordinary judgments of God, which are seen daily, or of the
   vengeance which he has once denounced upon the wicked, and which
   impends over them, but will not be manifested until the last day. I
   willingly, however, admit the former meaning -- that God, who is the
   perpetual Judge of the world, is accustomed to punish the crimes in
   question.

   He says, however, expressly, that the wrath of God will come, or is
   wont to come, upon the unbelieving or disobedient, instead of
   threatening them with anything of this nature. [437] For God would
   rather that we should see his wrath upon the reprobate, than feel it in
   ourselves. It is true, that when the promises of grace are set before
   us, every one of the pious ought to embrace them equally as though they
   were designed for himself particularly; but, on the other hand, let us
   dread the threatenings of wrath and destruction in such a manner, that
   those things which are suitable for the reprobate, may serve as a
   lesson to us. God, it is true, is often said to be angry even with his
   children, and sometimes chastens their sins with severity. Paul speaks
   here, however, of eternal destruction, of which a mirror is to be seen
   only in the reprobate. In short, whenever God threatens, he shews, as
   it were, indirectly the punishment, that, beholding it in the
   reprobate, we may be deterred from sinning.

   7. In which ye walked. Erasmus mistakingly refers this to men,
   rendering it, "inter quos," ("among whom,") for there can be no doubt
   that Paul had in view the vices, in which he, says that the Colossians
   had walked, during the time that they lived in them. For living and
   walking differ from each other, as power does from action. Living holds
   the first place: walking comes afterwards, as in Galatians 5:25,

   If ye live in the SPIRIT, WALK also in the Spirit.

   By these words he intimates, that it were an unseemly thing that they
   should addict themselves any more to the vices, to which they had died
   through Christ. See the [40]sixth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans.
   It is an argument from a withdrawment of the cause to a withdrawment of
   the effect.

   8. But now -- that is, after having ceased to live in the flesh. For
   the power and nature of mortification are such, that all corrupt
   affections are extinguished in us, lest sin should afterwards produce
   in us its wonted fruits. What I have rendered indignationem,
   (indignation,) is in the Greek thumos -- a term, which denotes a more
   impetuous passionateness than orge, (anger.) Here, however, he
   enumerates, as may easily be perceived, forms of vice that were
   different from those previously mentioned.

   Colossians 3:9-13

   9. Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with
   his deeds;

   9. Ne mentiamini alii diversus alios, postquam exuistis veterem hominem
   cum actionibus suis:

   10. And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after
   the image of him that created him:

   10. Et induistis novum, qui renovatur in agnitionem, secundum imaginem
   eius, qui creavit eum:

   11. Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor
   uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all,
   and in all.

   11. Ubi non est Graecus nec Judaeus, circumcisio nec praeputium,
   barbarus, Scytha, servus, liber: sed omnia et in omnibus Christus.

   12. Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of
   mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;

   12. Induite igitur, tanquam electi Dei sancti et dilecti, viscera
   miserationum, comitatem, humilitatem, mansuetudinem, tolerantiam,

   13. Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have
   a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.

   13. Sufferentes vos mutuo, et condonantes si quis adversus alium litem
   habeat: quemadmodum Christus condonavit vobis, ita et vos.


   9. Lie not. When he forbids lying, he condemns every sort of cunning,
   and all base artifices of deception. For I do not understand the term
   as referring merely to calumnies, but I view it as contrasted in a
   general way with sincerity. Hence it might be allowable to render it
   more briefly, and I am not sure but that it might also be a better
   rendering, thus: Lie not one to another. He follows out, however, his
   argument as to the fellowship, which believers have in the death and
   resurrection of Christ, but employs other forms of expression.

   The old man denotes -- whatever we bring from our mother's womb, and
   whatever we are by nature. [438] It is put off by all that are renewed
   by Christ. The new man, on the other hand, is that which is renewed by
   the Spirit of Christ to the obedience of righteousness, or it is nature
   restored to its true integrity by the same Spirit. The old man,
   however, comes first in order, because we are first born from Adam, and
   afterwards are born again through Christ. And as what we have from Adam
   becomes old, [439] and tends towards ruin, so what we obtain through
   Christ remains for ever, and is not frail; but, on the contrary, tends
   towards immortality. This passage is worthy of notice, inasmuch as a
   definition of regeneration may be gathered from it. For it contains two
   parts -- the putting off of the old man, and the putting on of the new,
   and of these Paul here makes mention. It is also to be noticed, that
   the old man is distinguished by his works, as a tree is by its fruits.
   Hence it follows, that the depravity that is innate in us is denoted by
   the term old man

   10. Which is renewed in knowledge. He shews in the first place, that
   newness of life consists in knowledge -- not as though a simple and
   bare knowledge were sufficient, but he speaks of the illumination of
   the Holy Spirit, which is lively and effectual, so as not merely to
   enlighten the mind by kindling it up with the light of truth, but
   transforming the whole man. And this is what he immediately adds, that
   we are renewed after the image of God. Now, the image of God resides in
   the whole of the soul, inasmuch as it is not the reason merely that is
   rectified, but also the will. Hence, too, we learn, on the one hand,
   what is the end of our regeneration, that is, that we may be made like
   God, and that his glory may shine forth in us; and, on the other hand,
   what is the image of God, of which mention is made by Moses in Genesis
   9:6, [440] the rectitude and integrity of the whole soul, so that man
   reflects, like a mirror, the wisdom, righteousness, and goodness of
   God. He speaks somewhat differently in the Epistle to the Ephesians,
   but the meaning is the same. See the passage -- Ephesians 4:24. Paul,
   at the same time, teaches, that there is nothing more excellent at
   which the Colossians can aspire, inasmuch as this is our highest
   perfection and blessedness to bear the image of God.

   11. Where there is neither Jew. He has added this intentionally, that
   he may again draw away the Colossians from ceremonies. For the meaning
   of the statement is this, that Christian perfection does not stand in
   need of those outward observances, nay, that they are things that are
   altogether at variance with it. For under the distinction of
   circumcision and uncircumcision, of Jew and Greek, he includes, by
   synecdoche, [441] all outward things. The terms that follow, barbarian,
   Scythian, [442] bond, free, are added by way of amplification.

   Christ is all, and in all, that is, Christ alone holds, as they say,
   the prow and the stern -- the beginning and the end. Farther, by
   Christ, he means the spiritual righteousness of Christ, which puts an
   end to ceremonies, as we have formerly seen. They are, therefore,
   superfluous in a state of true perfection, nay more, they ought to have
   no place, inasmuch as injustice would otherwise be done to Christ, as
   though it were necessary to call in those helps for making up his
   deficiencies.

   13. Put on therefore. As he has enumerated some parts of the old man,
   so he now also enumerates some parts of the new. "Then," says he, "will
   it appear that ye are renewed by Christ, when ye are merciful and kind.
   For these are the effects and evidences of renovation." Hence the
   exhortation depends on the second clause, and, accordingly, he keeps up
   the metaphor in the word rendered put on

   He mentions, first, bowels of mercy, by which expression he means an
   earnest affection, with yearnings, as it were, of the bowels: Secondly,
   he makes mention of kindness, (for in this manner I have chosen to
   render chrestoteta,) by which we make ourselves amiable. To this he
   adds humility, because no one will be kind and gentle but the man who,
   laying aside haughtiness, and high mindedness, brings himself down to
   the exercise of modesty, claiming nothing for himself.

   Gentleness -- the term which follows -- has a wider acceptation than
   kindness, for that is chiefly in look and speech, while this is also in
   inward disposition. As, however, it frequently happens, that we come in
   contact with wicked and ungrateful men, there is need of patience, that
   it may cherish mildness in us. He at length explains what he meant by
   long-suffering -- that we embrace each other indulgently, and forgive
   also where any offense has been given. As, however, it is a thing that
   is hard and difficult, he confirms this doctrine by the example of
   Christ, and teaches, that the same thing is required from us, that as
   we, who have so frequently and so grievously offended, have
   nevertheless been received into favor, we should manifest the same
   kindness towards our neighbors, by forgiving whatever offenses they
   have committed against us. Hence he says, if any one have a quarrel
   against another. By this he means, that even just occasions of quarrel,
   according to the views of men, ought not to be followed out.

   As the chosen of God. Elect I take here to mean, set apart. "God has
   chosen you to himself, has sanctified you, and received you into his
   love on this condition, that ye be merciful, etc. To no purpose does
   the man that has not these excellences boast that he is holy, and
   beloved of God; to no purpose does he reckon himself among the number
   of believers."

   Colossians 3:14-17

   14. And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of
   perfectness.

   14. Propter omnia haec caritatem, quae est vinculum perfectionis:

   15. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye
   are called in one body; and be ye thankful.

   15. Et pax Dei palmam obtineat [443] in cordibus vestris, ad quam etiam
   estis vocati in uno corpore, et grati sitis.

   16. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching
   and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,
   singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.

   16. Sermo Christi inhabiter in vobis opulente in omni sapientia,
   docendo et commonefaciendo vos psalmis, hymnis, et canticis
   spiritualibus cum gratia, canentes in cordibus vestris Domino.

   17. And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the
   Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.

   17. Et quiquid feceritis sermone vel opere, omnia in nomine Domini
   Iesu, gratiae agentes Deo et Patri, per ipsum.


   14. On account of all these things. The rendering that has been given
   by others, "super omnia haec," (above all these things,) instead of
   insuper, (over and above,) is, in my opinion, meagre. It would be more
   suitable to render it, Before all these things. I have chosen, however,
   the more ordinary signification of the word epi. For as all the things
   that he has hitherto enumerated flow from love, he now on good grounds
   exhorts the Colossians to cherish love among themselves, for the sake
   of these things -- that they may be merciful, gentle, ready to forgive,
   as though he had said, that they would be such only in the event of
   their having love. For where love is wanting, all these things are
   sought for in vain. That he may commend it the more, he calls it the
   bond of perfection, meaning by this, that the troop of all the virtues
   [444] is comprehended under it. For this truly is the rule of our whole
   life, and of all our actions, so that everything that is not regulated
   according to it is faulty, whatever attractiveness it may otherwise
   possess. This is the reason why it is called here the bond of
   perfection; because there is nothing in our life that is well regulated
   if it be not directed towards it, but everything that we attempt is
   mere waste.

   The Papists, however, act a ridiculous part in abusing this
   declaration, with the view of maintaining justification by works.
   "Love," say they, "is the bond of perfection: now perfection is
   righteousness; therefore we are justified by love." The answer is
   twofold; for Paul here is not reasoning as to the manner in which men
   are made perfect in the sight of God, but as to the manner in which
   they may live perfectly among themselves. For the genuine exposition of
   the passage is this -- that other things will be in a desirable state
   as to our life, if love be exercised among us. When, however, we grant
   that love is righteousness, they groundlessly and childishly take
   occasion from this to maintain, that we are justified by love, for
   where will perfect love be found? We, however, do not say that men are
   justified by faith alone, on the ground that the observance of the law
   is not righteousness, but rather on this ground, that as we are all
   transgressors of the law, we are, in consequence of our being destitute
   of any righteousness of our own, constrained to borrow righteousness
   from Christ. There remains nothing, therefore, but the righteousness of
   faith, because perfect love is nowhere to be found.

   15. And the peace of God. He gives the name of the peace of God to that
   which God has established among us, as will appear from what follows.
   He would have it reign in our hearts. [445] He employs, however, a very
   appropriate metaphor; for as among wrestlers, [446] he who has
   vanquished all the others carries off the palm, so he would have the
   peace of God be superior to all carnal affections, which often hurry us
   on to contentions, disagreements, quarrels, secret grudges. He
   accordingly prohibits us from giving loose reins to corrupt affections
   of this kind. As, however it is difficult to restrain them, he points
   out also the remedy, that the peace of God may carry the victory,
   because it must be a bridle, by which carnal affections may be
   restrained. Hence he says, in our hearts; because we constantly feel
   there great conflicts, while the flesh lusteth against the Spirit.
   (Galatians 5:17.)

   The clause, to which ye are called, intimates what manner of peace this
   is -- that unity which Christ has consecrated among us under his own
   direction. [447] For God has reconciled us to himself in Christ, (2
   Corinthians 5:18,) with this view, that we may live in entire harmony
   among ourselves. He adds, in one body, meaning by this, that we cannot
   be in a state of agreement with God otherwise than by being united
   among ourselves as members of one body. When he bids us be thankful, I
   do not take this as referring so much to the remembrance of favors, as
   to sweetness of manners. Hence, with the view of removing ambiguity, I
   prefer to render it, "Be amiable." At the same time I acknowledge that,
   if gratitude takes possession of our minds, [448] we shall without fail
   be inclined to cherish mutual affection among ourselves.

   16. Let the word of Christ dwell. He would have the doctrine of the
   gospel be familiarly known by them. Hence we may infer by what spirit
   those are actuated in the present day, who cruelly [449] interdict the
   Christian people from making use of it, and furiously vociferate, that
   no pestilence is more to be dreaded, than that the reading of the
   Scriptures should be thrown open to the common people. For,
   unquestionably, Paul here addresses men and women of all ranks; nor
   would he simply have them take a slight taste merely of the word of
   Christ, but exhorts that it should dwell in them; that is, that it
   should have a settled abode, and that largely, that they may make it
   their aim to advance and increase more and more every day. As, however,
   the desire of learning is extravagant on the part of many, while they
   pervert the word of the Lord for their own ambition, or for vain
   curiosity, or in some way corrupt it, he on this account adds, in all
   wisdom -- that, being instructed by it, we may be wise as we ought to
   be.

   Farther, he gives a short definition of this wisdom -- that the
   Colossians teach one another Teaching is taken here to mean profitable
   instruction, which tends to edification, as in Romans 12:7 -- He that
   teacheth, on teaching; also in Timothy -- "All Scripture is profitable
   for teaching." (2 Timothy 3:16.) This is the true use of Christ's word.
   As, however, doctrine is sometimes in itself cold, and, as one says,
   [450] when it is simply shewn what is right, virtue is praised [451]
   and left to starve, [452] he adds at the same time admonition, which
   is, as it were, a confirmation of doctrine and incitement to it. Nor
   does he mean that the word of Christ ought to be of benefit merely to
   individuals, that they may teach themselves, but he requires mutual
   teaching and admonition.

   Psalms, hymns. He does not restrict the word of Christ to these
   particular departments, but rather intimates that all our
   communications should be adapted to edification, that even those which
   tend to hilarity may have no empty savor. "Leave to unbelievers that
   foolish delight which they take from ludicrous and frivolous jests and
   witticisms; [453] and let your communications, not merely those that
   are grave, but those also that are joyful and exhilarating, contain
   something profitable. In place of their obscene, or at least barely
   modest and decent, songs, it becomes you to make use of hymns and songs
   that sound forth God's praise." Farther, under these three terms he
   includes all kinds of songs. They are commonly distinguished in this
   way -- that a psalm is that, in the singing of which some musical
   instrument besides the tongue is made use of: a hymn is properly a song
   of praise, whether it be sung simply with the voice or otherwise; while
   an ode contains not merely praises, but exhortations and other matters.
   He would have the songs of Christians, however, to be spiritual, not
   made up of frivolities and worthless trifles. For this has a connection
   with his argument.

   The clause, in grace, Chrysostom explains in different ways. I,
   however, take it simply, as also afterwards, in Colossians 4:6, where
   he says, "Let your speech be seasoned with salt, in grace," that is, by
   way of a dexterity that may be agreeable, and may please the hearers by
   its profitableness, so that it may be opposed to buffoonery and similar
   trifles.

   Singing in your hearts. This relates to disposition; for as we ought to
   stir up others, so we ought also to sing from the heart, that there may
   not be merely an external sound with the mouth. At the same time, we
   must not understand it as though he would have every one sing inwardly
   to himself, but he would have both conjoined, provided the heart goes
   before the tongue.

   17. And whatsoever ye do. We have already explained these things, and
   what goes before, in [43]the Epistle to the Ephesians, where the same
   things are said almost word for word. As he had already begun to
   discourse in reference to different parts of the Christian life, and
   had simply touched upon a few precepts, it would have been too tedious
   a thing to follow out the rest one by one, he therefore concludes in a
   summary way, that life must be regulated in such a manner, that
   whatever we say or do may be wholly governed by the authority of
   Christ, and may have an eye to his glory as the mark. [454] For we
   shall fitly comprehend under this term the two following things -- that
   all our aims [455] may set out with invocation of Christ, and may be
   subservient to his glory. From invocation follows the act of blessing
   God, which supplies us with matter of thanksgiving. It is also to be
   observed, that he teaches that we must give thanks to the Father
   through Christ, as we obtain through him every good thing that God
   confers upon us.

   Colossians 3:18-25

   18. Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in
   the Lord.

   18. Mulieres, subditae estote propriis maritis, quemadmodum decet in
   Domino.

   19. Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.

   19. Viri, diligite uxores, et ne amari sitis adversus illas.

   20. Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well
   pleasing unto the Lord.

   20. Filii, obedite parentibus vestris per omnia: hoc enim placet
   Domino.

   21. Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be
   discouraged.

   21. Patres, ne provocetis liberos vestros, ne deiiciantur animis.

   22. Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh;
   not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart,
   fearing God:

   22. Servi, obedite per omnia iis, qui secundum carnem sunt domini: non
   exhibitis ad oculum obsequiis, tanquam hominibus placere studentes, sed
   in simplicitate cordis, ut qui timeatis Deum.

   23. And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto
   men;

   23. Et quicquid feceritis, ex animo facite, tanquam Domino, et non
   hominibus:

   24. Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the
   inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.

   24. Scientes quod a Domino recipietis mercedem hereditatis, nam Domino
   Christo servitis.

   25. But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath
   done: and there is no respect of persons.

   25. Qui autem iniuste egerit, mercedem reportabit suae iniquitatis: et
   non est personarum acceptio. (Deuteronomy 10:17.)


   18 Wives, be subject. Now follow particular duties, as they are called,
   [456] which depend on the calling of individuals. In handling these it
   were superfluous to take up many words, inasmuch as I have already
   stated in the Epistle to the Ephesians [457] almost everything that was
   necessary. Here I shall only add briefly such things as are more
   particularly suited to an exposition of the passage before us.

   He commands wives to be subject. This is clear, but what follows is of
   doubtful signification -- as it is fit in the Lord. For some connect it
   thus -- "Be subject in the Lord, as it is fit." I, however, view it
   rather differently, -- As it is fit in the Lord, that is, according to
   the appointment of the Lord, so that he confirms the subjection of
   wives by the authority of God. He requires love on the part of
   husbands, and that they be not bitter, because there is a danger lest
   they should abuse their authority in the way of tyranny.

   20 Children, obey your parents. He enjoins it upon children to obey
   their parents, [458] without any exception. But what if parents [459]
   should feel disposed to constrain them to anything that is unlawful;
   will they in that case, too, obey without any reservation? Now it were
   worse than unreasonable, that the, authority of men should prevail at
   the expense of neglecting God. I answer, that here, too, we must
   understand as implied what he expresses elsewhere, (Ephesians 6:1) --
   in the Lord. But for what purpose does he employ a term of
   universality? I answer again, that it is to shew, that obedience must
   be rendered not merely to just commands, but also to such as are
   unreasonable. [460] For many make themselves compliant with the wishes
   of their parents only where the command is not grievous or
   inconvenient. But, on the other hand, this one thing ought to be
   considered by children -- that whoever may be their parents, they have
   been allotted to them by the providence of God, who by his appointment
   makes children subject to their parents.

   In all things, therefore, that they may not refuse anything, however
   difficult or disagreeable -- in all things, that in things indifferent
   they may give deference to the station which their parents occupy -- in
   all things, that they may not put themselves on a footing of equality
   with their parents, in the way of questioning and debating, or
   disputing, it being always understood that conscience is not to be
   infringed upon. [461] He prohibits parents from exercising an
   immoderate harshness, lest their children should be so disheartened as
   to be incapable of receiving any honorable training; for we see, from
   daily experience, the advantage of a liberal education.

   22 Servants, be obedient. Anything that is stated here respecting
   servants requires no exposition, as it has been already expounded in
   commenting on [44]Ephesians 6:1, with the exception of these two
   expressions, -- For we serve the Lord Christ; and, He that will act
   unjustly will receive the reward of his iniquity.

   By the former statement he means, that service is done to men in such a
   way that Christ at the same time holds supremacy of dominion, and is
   the supreme master. Here, truly, is choice consolation for all that are
   under subjection, inasmuch as they are informed that, while they
   willingly serve their masters, their services are acceptable to Christ,
   as though they had been rendered to him. From this, also, Paul gathers,
   that they will receive from him a reward, but it is the reward of
   inheritance, by which he means that the very thing that is bestowed in
   reward of works is freely given to us by God, for inheritance comes
   from adoption.

   In the second clause he again comforts servants, by saying that, if
   they are oppressed by the unjust cruelty of their masters, God himself
   will take vengeance, and will not, on the ground that they are
   servants, overlook the injuries inflicted upon them, inasmuch as there
   is no respect of persons with him. For this consideration might
   diminish their courage, if they imagined that God had no regard for
   them, or no great regard, and that their miseries gave him no concern.
   Besides, it often happens that servants themselves endeavor to avenge
   injurious and cruel treatment. He obviates, accordingly, this evil, by
   admonishing them to wait patiently the judgment of God.

   CHAPTER 4
     __________________________________________________________________

   Colossians 4:1-4

   1. Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal;
   knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.

   1. Domini, quod iustum est, servis exhibete, mutuamque aequabilitatem,
   scientes quod vos quoque Dominum habeatis in coelis.

   2. Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;

   2. Orationi instate, vigilantes in ea, cum gratiarum actione.

   3. Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of
   utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in
   bonds:

   3. Orate simul et pro nobis, ut Deus aperiat nobis ianuam sermonis ad
   loquendum mysterium Christi, cuius etiam causa vinctus sum.

   4. That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.

   4. Ut manifestem illud, quemadmodum oportet me loqui.


   1. Masters, what is just. He mentions first, what is just, by which
   term he expresses that kindness, as to which he has given injunction in
   the Epistle to the Ephesians. (Ephesians 6:8.) But as masters, looking
   down as it were from aloft, despise the condition of servants, so that
   they think that they are bound by no law, Paul brings them under
   control, [462] because both are equally under subjection to the
   authority of God. Hence that equity of which he makes mention.

   And mutual equity. Some understand it otherwise, but I have no doubt
   that Paul here employed isoteta to mean analogical [463] or
   distributive right, [464] as in Ephesians, ta auta, (the same things.)
   [465] For masters have not their servants bound to them in such a
   manner as not to owe something to them in their turn, as analogical
   right to be in force among all ranks. [466]

   2. Continue in prayer. He returns to general exhortations, in which we
   must not expect an exact order, for in that case he would have begun
   with prayer, but Paul had not an eye to that. Farther, as to prayer, he
   commends here two things; first, assiduity; secondly, alacrity, or
   earnest intentness. For, when he says, continue, he exhorts to
   perseverance, while he makes mention of watching in opposition to
   coldness, and listlessness. [467]

   He adds, thanksgiving, because God must be solicited for present
   necessity in such a way that, in the mean time, we do not forget favors
   already received. Farther, we ought not to be so importunate as to
   murmur, and feel offended if God does not immediately gratify our
   wishes, but must receive contentedly whatever he gives. Thus a twofold
   giving of thanks is necessary. As to this point something has also been
   said in the Epistle to the Philippians. (Philippians 4:6.)

   3. Pray also for us. He does not say this by way of pretense, but
   because, being conscious to himself of his own necessity, he was
   earnestly desirous to be aided by their prayers, and was fully
   persuaded that they would be of advantage to them. Who then, in the
   present day, would dare to despise the intercessions of brethren, which
   Paul openly declares himself to stand in need of? And, unquestionably,
   it is not in vain that the Lord has appointed this exercise of love
   between us -- that we pray for each other. Not only, therefore, ought
   each of us to pray for his brethren, but we ought also, on our part,
   diligently to seek help from the prayers of others, as often as
   occasion requires. It is, however, a childish [468] argument on the
   part of Papists, who infer from this, that the dead must be implored
   [469] to pray for us. For what is there here that bears any resemblance
   to this? Paul commends himself to the prayers of the brethren, with
   whom he knows that he has mutual fellowship according to the
   commandment of God: who will deny that this reason does not hold in the
   case of the dead? Leaving, therefore, such trifles, let us return to
   Paul.

   As we have a signal example of modesty, in the circumstance that Paul
   calls others to his assistance, so we are also admonished, that it is a
   thing that is replete with the greatest difficulty, to persevere
   steadfastly in the defense of the gospel, and especially when danger
   presses. For it is not without cause that he desires that the Churches
   may assist him in this matter. Consider, too, at the same time, his
   amazing ardor of zeal. He is not solicitous as to his own safety; [470]
   he does not ask that prayers may be poured forth by the Churches on his
   behalf, that he may be delivered from danger of death. He is contented
   with this one thing, that he may, unconquered and undaunted, persevere
   in a confession of the gospel; nay more, he fearlessly makes his own
   life a secondary matter, as compared with the glory of Christ and the
   spread of the gospel.

   By a door of utterance, however, he simply means what, in Ephesians
   6:19, he terms the opening of the mouth, and what Christ calls a mouth
   and wisdom. (Luke 21:15.) For the expression differs nothing from the
   other in meaning, but merely in form, for he here intimates, by all
   elegant metaphor, that it is in no degree easier for us to speak
   confidently respecting the gospel, than to break through a door that is
   barred and bolted. For this is truly a divine work, as Christ himself
   said,

   It is not ye that speak,
   but the Spirit of your Father
   that speaketh in you.
   (Matthew 10:20.)

   Having, therefore, set forward the difficulty, he stirs up the
   Colossians the more to prayer, by declaring that he cannot speak right,
   except in so far as his tongue is directed by the Lord. Secondly, he
   argues from the dignity [471] of the matter, when he calls the gospel
   the mystery of Christ. For we must labor in a more perfunctory manner
   in a matter of such importance. Thirdly, he makes mention also of his
   danger.

   4. As I ought. This clause sets forth more strongly the difficulty, for
   he intimates that it is no ordinary matter. In the Epistle to the
   Ephesians, (Ephesians 6:20,) he adds, hina parresiasomai, (that I may
   speak boldly,) from which it appears that he desired for himself an
   undaunted confidence, such as befits the majesty of the gospel.
   Farther, as Paul here does nothing else than desire that grace may be
   given him for the discharge of his office, let us bear in mind that a
   rule is in like manner prescribed to us, not to give way to the fury of
   our adversaries, but to strive even to death in the publication of the
   gospel. As this, however, is beyond our power, it is necessary that we
   should continue in prayer, that the Lord may not leave us destitute of
   the spirit of confidence.

   Colossians 4:5-9

   5. Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.

   5. Sapienter ambulate erga extraneos, tempus redimentes.

   6. Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may
   know how ye ought to answer every man.

   6. Sermo vester semper in gratia sit sale conditus: ut sciatis quomodo
   oporteat vos unicuique respondere.

   7. All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved
   brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord:

   7. Res meas omnes patefaciet vobis Tychicus dilectus frater et fidelis
   minister ac conservus in Domino.

   8. Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know
   your estate, and comfort your hearts;

   8. Quem misi ad vos hac de causa, ut sciretis statum meum, et
   consolaretur corda vestra:

   9. With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you.
   They shall make known unto you all things which are done here.

   9. Cum Onesimo fideli et dilecto fratre, qui est ex vobis. Omnia
   patefacient vobis quae hic sunt.


   5. Walk wisely. He makes mention of those that are without, in contrast
   with those that are of the household of faith. (Galatians 6:10.) For
   the Church is like a city of which all believers are the inhabitants,
   connected with each other by a mutual relationship, while unbelievers
   are strangers. But why would he have regard to be had to them, rather
   than to believers? There are three reasons: first,

   lest any stumblingblock be put in,
   the way of the blind, (Leviticus 19:14,)

   for nothing is more ready to occur, than that unbelievers are driven
   from bad to worse through our imprudence, and their minds are wounded,
   so that they hold religion more and more in abhorrence. Secondly, it is
   lest any occasion may be given for detracting from the honor of the
   gospel, and thus the name of Christ be exposed to derision, persons be
   rendered more hostile, and disturbances and persecutions be stirred up.
   Lastly, it is, lest, while we are mingled together, in partaking of
   food, and on other occasions, we be defiled by their pollutions, and by
   little and little become profane.

   To the same effect, also, is what follows, redeeming the time, that is,
   because intercourse with them is dangerous. For in Ephesians 5:16, he
   assigns the reason, because the days are evil. "Amidst so great a
   corruption as prevails in the world we must seize opportunities of
   doing good, and we must struggle against impediments." The more,
   therefore, that our path is blocked up with occasions of offense, so
   much the more carefully must we take heed lest our feet should stumble,
   or we should stop short through indolence.

   6. Your speech. He requires suavity of speech, such as may allure the
   hearers by its profitableness, for he does not merely condemn
   communications that are openly wicked or impious, but also such as are
   worthless and idle. Hence he would have them seasoned with salt.
   Profane men have their seasonings of discourse, [472] but he does not
   speak of them; nay more, as witticisms are insinuating, and for the
   most part procure favor, [473] he indirectly prohibits believers from
   the practice and familiar use of them. For he reckons as tasteless
   everything that does not edify. The term grace is employed in the same
   sense, so as to be opposed to talkativeness, taunts, and all sorts of
   trifles which are either injurious or vain. [474]

   That ye may know how. The man who has accustomed himself to caution in
   his communications will not fall into many absurdities, into which
   talkative and prating persons fall into from time to time, but, by
   constant practice, will acquire for himself expertness in making proper
   and suitable replies; as, on the other hand, it must necessarily
   happen, that silly talkers expose themselves to derision whenever they
   are interrogated as to anything; and in this they pay the just
   punishment of their silly talkativeness. Nor does he merely say what,
   but also how, and not to all indiscriminately, but to every one. For
   this is not the least important part of prudence -- to have due regard
   to individuals. [475]

   7 My things. That the Colossians may know what concern he has for them,
   he confirms them, by giving them, in a manner, a pledge. For although
   he was in prison, and was in danger of his life, making care for
   himself a secondary matter, he consults for their interests by sending
   Tychicus to them. In this the singular zeal, no less than prudence of
   the holy Apostle, shines forth; for it is no small matter that, while
   he is held prisoner, and is in the most imminent danger on account of
   the gospel, he, nevertheless, does not cease to employ himself in
   advancing the gospel, and takes care of all the Churches. Thus, the
   body, indeed, is under confinement, but the mind, anxious to employ
   itself in everything good, roams far and wide. His prudence shews
   itself in his sending a fit and prudent person to confirm them, as far
   as was necessary, and withstand the craftiness of the false apostles;
   and, farther, in his retaining Epaphras beside himself, until they
   should come to learn what and how great an agreement there was in
   doctrine among all true teachers, and might hear from Tychicus the same
   thing that they had previously learned from Epaphras. Let us carefully
   meditate on these examples, that they may stir us up to all imitation
   of the like pursuit.

   He adds, Onesimus, that the embassy may have the more weight. It is,
   however, uncertain who this Onesimus was. For it can scarcely be
   believed that this is the slave of Philemon, inasmuch as the name of a
   thief and a fugitive would have been liable to reproach. [476] He
   distinguishes both of them by honorable titles, that they may do the
   more good, and especially Tychicus, who was to exercise the office of
   an instructor.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [472] Sales. The term is frequently employed by classical writers to
   denote witticisms. See Cic. Fam. 9:15; Juv. 9:11; Hor. Ep. 2:2, 60. --
   Ed.

   [473] "Et que par ce moyen il seroit a craindre que les fideles ne s'y
   addonassent;" -- "And as on this account it was to be feared that
   believers would addict themselves to this."

   [474] "Ou s'en vont en fumee;" -- "Or vanish into smoke."

   [475] "Car c'est des principales parties de vraye prudence, de scauoir
   discerner les personnes pour parler aux vns et aux autres comme il est
   de besoin;" -- "For it is one of the chief departments of true
   prudence, to know how to discriminate as to individuals, in speaking to
   one and to another, as there may be occasion."

   [476] Paley, in his Horae Paulinae, finds the statement here made
   respecting Onesimus, "who is one of you," one of the many undesigned
   coincidences which he adduces in that admirable treatise, in evidence
   of the credibility of the New Testament. The train of his reasoning in
   this instance may be briefly stated thus -- that while it appears from
   the Epistle to Philemon, that Onesimus was the servant or slave of
   Philemon, it is not stated in that Epistle to what city Philemon
   belonged; but that it appears from the Epistle, (Philem. 1, 2,) that he
   was of the same place, whatever that place was, with an eminent
   Christian, named Archippus, whom we find saluted by name amongst the
   Colossian Christians; while the expression made use of by Paul here
   respecting Onesimus, "who is one of you," clearly marks him out as
   being of the same city, viz., Colosse. -- Ed.

   Colossians 4:10-13

   10. Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister's
   son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come
   unto you, receive him;)

   10. Salutat vos Aristarchus, concaptivus meus, et Marcus, cognatus
   Barnabae, de quo accepistis mandata si venerit ad vos, ut suscipiatis
   ipsum.

   11. And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision.
   These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have
   been a comfort unto me.

   11. Et Iesus qui dicitur Iustus, qui sunt ex circumcisione, hi soli
   cooperarii in regnum Dei, qui mihi fuerunt solatio.

   12. Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you,
   always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand
   perfect and complete in all the will of God.

   12. Salutat vos Epaphras, qui est ex vobis servus Christi, semper
   decertans pro vobis in precationibus, ut stetis perfecti et completi in
   omni voluntate Dei.

   13. For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them
   that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.

   13. Testimonium enim illi reddo, quod multum studium vestri habeat, et
   eorum qui sunt Laodiceae et Hierapoli.


   10. Fellow-prisoner. From this it appears that there were others that
   were associated with Paul, [477] after he was brought to Rome. It is
   also probable that his enemies exerted themselves, in the outset, to
   deter all pious persons from giving him help, by threatening them with
   the like danger, and that this for a time had the desired effect; but
   that afterwards some, gathering up courage, despised everything that
   was held out to them in the way of terror.

   That ye receive him. Some manuscripts have receive in the imperative
   mood; but it is a mistake, for he expresses the nature of the charge
   which the Colossians had received -- that it was a commendation of
   either Barnabas, or of Marcus. The latter is the more probable. In the
   Greek it is the infinitive mood, [478] but it may be rendered in the
   way I have done. Let us, however, observe, that they were careful in
   furnishing attestations, that they might distinguish good men from
   false brethren -- from pretenders, from impostors, and multitudes of
   vagrants. The same care is more than simply necessary at the present
   day, both because good teachers are coldly received, and because
   credulous and foolish men lay themselves too open to be deceived by
   impostors.

   11. These only are fellow-workers, -- that is, of the circumcision; for
   he afterwards names others, but they were of the uncircumcision. He
   means, therefore, that there were few Jews at Rome who shewed
   themselves to be helpers to the gospel, nay more, that the whole nation
   was opposed to Christ. At the same time, by workers he means those only
   who were endowed with gifts that were necessary for promoting the
   gospel. But where was Peter at that time? Unquestionably, he has either
   been shamefully passed over here, and not without injustice, or else
   those speak falsely who maintain that he was then at Rome. Farther, he
   calls the gospel the kingdom of God, for it is the scepter by which God
   reigns over us, and by means of it we are singled out to life eternal.
   [479] But of this form of expression we shall treat more fully
   elsewhere.

   12 Always striving. Here we have an example of a good pastor, whom
   distance of place cannot induce to forget the Church, so as to prevent
   him from taking the care of it with him beyond the sea. We must notice,
   also, the strength of entreaty that is expressed in the word striving.
   For although the Apostle had it in view here to express intensity of
   affection, he at the same time admonishes the Colossians not to look
   upon the prayers of their pastor as useless, but, on the contrary, to
   reckon that they would afford them no small assistance. Lastly, let us
   infer from Paul's words, that the perfection of Christians is, when
   they stand complete in the will of God, that they may not suspend their
   scheme of life upon anything else.

   14. Salutat vos Lucas medicus dilectus, et Demas.

   15. Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the
   church which is in his house.

   15. Salutate fratres qui sunt Laodiceae, et Nympham, et Ecclesiam quae
   est domi ipsius;

   16. And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also
   in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle
   from Laodicea.

   16. Et quum lecta fuerit apud vos epistola, facite ut etiam in
   Laodicensium Ecclesia legatur: et eam quae ex Laodicea est ut vos
   legatis.

   17. And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast
   received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.

   17. Et dicite Archippo: Vide ministerium quod accepisti in Domino, ut
   illud impleas.

   18. The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be
   with you. Amen.

   vobiscum. Amen.

   14. Luke saluteth you. I do not agree with those who understand this to
   be Luke the Evangelist; for I am of opinion that he was too well known
   to stand in need of such a designation, and he would have been
   signalized by a more magnificent eulogium. He would, undoubtedly, have
   called him his fellow-helper, or at least his companion and participant
   in his conflicts. I rather conjecture that he was absent at that time,
   and that it is another of the same name that is called a physician, to
   distinguish him from the other. Demas, of whom he makes mention, is
   undoubtedly the person of whom he complains -- that he afterwards
   deserted him. (2 Timothy 4:10.)

   When he speaks of the Church which was in the house of Nymphas, let us
   bear in mind, that, in the instance of one household, a rule is laid
   down as to what it becomes all Christian households to be -- that they
   be so many little Churches. [480] Let every one, therefore, know that
   this charge is laid upon him -- that he is to train up his house in the
   fear of the Lord, to keep it under a holy discipline, and, in fine, to
   form in it the likeness of a Church.

   16. Let it be read in the Church of the Laodiceans. Hence, though it
   was addressed to the Colossians, it was, nevertheless, necessary that
   it should be profitable to others. The same view must also be taken of
   all the Epistles. They were indeed, in the first instance, addressed to
   particular Churches, but, as they contain doctrine that is always in
   force, and is common to all ages, it is of no importance what title
   they bear, for the subject matter belongs to us. It has been
   groundlessly supposed that the other Epistle of which he makes mention
   was written by Paul, and those labor under a double mistake who think
   that it was written by Paul to the Laodiceans. I have no doubt that it
   was an Epistle that had been sent to Paul, the perusal of which might
   be profitable to the Colossians, as neighboring towns have usually many
   things in common. There was, however, an exceedingly gross imposture in
   the circumstance that some worthless person, I know not who, had the
   audacity to forge, under this pretext, an Epistle, that is so insipid,
   [481] that nothing can be conceived to be more foreign to Paul's
   spirit.

   17 Say to Archippus. So far as I can conjecture, this Archippus was, in
   the mean time, discharging the office of pastor, during the absence of
   Epaphras; but perhaps he was not of such a disposition as to be
   sufficiently diligent of himself without being stirred up. Paul,
   accordingly, would have him be more fully encouraged by the exhortation
   of the whole Church. He might have admonished him in his own name
   individually; but he gives this charge to the Colossians that they may
   know that they must themselves employ incitements, [482] if they see
   their pastor cold, and the pastor himself does not refuse to be
   admonished by the Church. For the ministers of the word are endowed
   with signal authority, but such at the same time as is not exempt from
   laws. Hence, it is necessary that they should shew themselves teachable
   if they would duly teach others. As to Paul's calling attention again
   [483] to his bonds, he intimates by this that he was in no slight
   degree afflicted. For he was mindful of human infirmity, and without
   doubt he felt some twinges of it in himself, inasmuch as he was so very
   urgent that all pious persons, should be mindful of his distresses. It
   is, however, no evidence of distrust, that he calls in from all
   quarters the helps that were appointed him by the Lord. The
   subscription, with his own hand, means, as we have seen elsewhere, that
   there were even then spurious epistles in circulation, so that it was
   necessary to provide against imposition. [484]

   THE AUTHOR'S DEDICATORY EPISTLE.

   TO

   MATURINUS CORDERIUS,

   A MAN OF EMINENT PIETY AND LEARNING, PRINCIPAL OF THE COLLEGE OF
   LAUSANNE.

   It is befitting that you should come in for a share in my labors,
   inasmuch as, under your auspices, having entered on a course of study,
   I made proficiency at least so far as to be prepared to profit in some
   degree the Church of God. When my father sent me, while yet a boy, to
   Paris, after I had simply tasted the first elements of the Latin
   tongue; Providence so ordered it that I had, for a short time, the
   privilege of having you as my instructor, [485] that I might be taught
   by you the true method of learning, in such a way that I might be
   prepared afterwards to make somewhat better proficiency. For, after
   presiding over the first class with the highest renown, on observing
   that pupils who had been ambitiously trained up by the other masters,
   produced nothing but mere show, nothing of solidity, so that they
   required to be formed by you anew, tired of this annoyance, you that
   year descended to the fourth class. This, indeed, was what you had in
   view, but to me it was a singular kindness on the part of God that I
   happened to have an auspicious commencement of such a course of
   training. And although I was permitted to have the use of it only for a
   short time, from the circumstance that we were soon afterwards advanced
   higher by an injudicious man, who regulated our studies according to
   his own pleasure, or rather his caprice, yet I derived so much
   assistance afterwards from your training, that it is with good reason
   that I acknowledge myself indebted to you for such progress as has
   since been made. And this I was desirous to testify to posterity, that,
   if any advantage shall accrue to them from my writings, they shall know
   that it has in some degree originated with you.

   Geneva, 17th February 1550.

   ARGUMENT

   ON

   THE FIRST EPISTLE TO THE THESSALONIANS.

   The greater part of this Epistle consists of exhortations. Paul had
   instructed the Thessalonians in the right faith. On hearing, however,
   that persecutions were raging there, [486] he had sent Timothy with the
   view of animating them for the conflict, that they might not give way
   through fear, as human infirmity is apt to do. Having been afterwards
   informed by Timothy respecting their entire condition, he employs
   various arguments to confirm them in steadfastness of faith, as well as
   in patience, should they be called to endure anything for the testimony
   of the gospel. These things he treats of in the first three Chapters.

   In the beginning of the Fourth Chapter, he exhorts them, in general
   terms, to holiness of life, afterwards he recommends mutual
   benevolence, and all offices that flow from it. Towards the end,
   however, he touches upon the question of the resurrection, and explains
   in what way we shall all be raised up from death. From this it is
   manifest, that there were some wicked or light-minded persons, who
   endeavored to unsettle their faith by unseasonably bringing forward
   many frivolous things. [487] Hence with the view of cutting off all
   pretext for foolish and needless disputations, he instructs them in few
   words as to the views which they should entertain.

   In the Fifth Chapter he prohibits them, even more strictly, from
   inquiring as to times; but admonishes them to be ever on the watch,
   lest they should be taken unawares by Christ's sudden and unexpected
   approach. From this he proceeds to employ various exhortations, and
   then concludes the Epistle.

   COMMENTARY ON

   THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS.

   CHAPTER 1
     __________________________________________________________________

   1 Thessalonians 1:1

   1. Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the Church of the
   Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ:
   Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus
   Christ.

   1. Paulus et Silvanus et Timotheus Ecclesiae Thessalonicensium, in Deo
   Patre, et Domino Iesu Christo, gratia vobis et pax a Deo Patre nostro,
   et Domino Iesu Christo.


   The brevity of the inscription clearly shews that Paul's doctrine had
   been received with reverence among the Thessalonians, and that without
   controversy they all rendered to him the honor that he deserved. For
   when in other Epistles he designates himself an Apostle, he does this
   for the purpose of claiming for himself authority. Hence the
   circumstance, that he simply makes use of his own name without any
   title of honor, is an evidence that those to whom he writes voluntarily
   acknowledged him to be such as he was. The ministers of Satan, it is
   true, had endeavored to trouble this Church also, but it is evident
   that their machinations were fruitless. He associates, however, two
   others along with himself, as being, in common with himself, the
   authors of the Epistle. Nothing farther is stated here that has not
   been explained elsewhere, excepting that he says, "the Church in God
   the Father, and in Christ;" by which terms (if I mistake not) he
   intimates, that there is truly among the Thessalonians a Church of God.
   This mark, therefore, is as it were an approval of a true and lawful
   Church. We may, however, at the same time infer from it, that a Church
   is to be sought for only where God presides, and where Christ reigns,
   and that, in short, there is no Church but what is founded upon God, is
   gathered under the auspices of Christ, and is united in his name.

   1 Thessalonians 1:2-5

   2. We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in
   our prayers;

   2. Gratias agimus Deo semper de omnibus vobis, memoriam vestri
   facientes in precibus nostris,

   3. Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love,
   and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and
   our Father;

   3. Indesinenter [488] memores vestri, propter opus fidei, et laborem
   caritatis, [489] et patientiam spei Domini nostri Iesu Christi coram
   Deo et Patre nostro,

   4. Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.

   4. Scientes, fratres dilecti, [490] a Deo esse electionem vestram.

   5. For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power,
   and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of
   men we were among you for your sake.

   5. Quia Evangelium nostrum non fuit erga vos in sermone solum, sed in
   potentia, et in Spiritu sancto, et in certitudine multa: quemadmodum
   nostis quales fuerimus in vobis propter vos.


   2 We give thanks to God. He praises, as he is wont, their faith and
   other virtues, not so much, however, for the purpose of praising them,
   as to exhort them to perseverance. For it is no small excitement to
   eagerness of pursuit, when we reflect that God has adorned us with
   signal endowments, that he may finish what he has begun, and that we
   have, under his guidance and direction, advanced in the right course,
   in order that we may reach the goal. For as a vain confidence in those
   virtues, which mankind foolishly arrogate to themselves, puffs them up
   with pride, and makes them careless and indolent for the time to come,
   so a recognition of the gifts of God humbles pious minds, and stirs
   them up to anxious concern. Hence, instead of congratulations, he makes
   use of thanksgivings, that he may put them in mind, that everything in
   them that he declares to be worthy of praise, is a kindness from God.
   [491] He also turns immediately to the future, in making mention of his
   prayers. We thus see for what purpose he commends their previous life.

   3 Unceasingly remembering you. While the adverb unceasingly might be
   taken in connection with what goes before, it suits better to connect
   it in this manner. What follows might also be rendered in this way:
   Remembering your work of faith and labor of love, etc. Nor is it any
   objection to this that there is an article interposed between the
   pronoun humon and the noun ergou, [492] for this manner of expression
   is frequently made use of by Paul. I state this, lest any one should
   charge the old translator with ignorance, from his rendering it in this
   manner. [493] As, however, it matters little as to the main point [494]
   which you may choose, I have retained the rendering of Erasmus. [495]

   He assigns a reason, however, why he cherishes so strong an affection
   towards them, and prays diligently in their behalf -- because he
   perceived in them those gifts of God which should stir him up to
   cherish towards them love and respect. And, unquestionably, the more
   that any one excels in piety and other excellences, so much the more
   ought we to hold him in regard and esteem. For what is more worthy of
   love than God? Hence there is nothing that should tend more to excite
   our love to individuals, than when the Lord manifests himself in them
   by the gifts of his Spirit. This is the highest commendation of all
   among the pious -- this the most sacred bond of connection, by which
   they are more especially bound to each other. I have said, accordingly,
   that it is of little importance, whether you render it mindful of your
   faith, or mindful of you on account of your faith.

   Work of faith I understand as meaning the effect of it. This effect,
   however, may be explained in two ways -- passively or actively, either
   as meaning that faith was in itself a signal token of the power and
   efficacy of the Holy Spirit, inasmuch as he has wrought powerfully in
   the exciting of it, or as meaning that it afterwards produced outwardly
   its fruits. I reckon the effect to be in the root of faith rather than
   in its fruits -- "A rare energy of faith has strewn itself powerfully
   in you."

   He adds labor of love, by which he means that in the cultivation of
   love they had grudged no trouble or labor. And, assuredly, it is known
   by experience, how laborious love is. That age, however, more
   especially afforded to believers a manifold sphere of labor, if they
   were desirous to discharge the offices of love. The Church was
   marvelously pressed down by a great multitude of afflictions: [496]
   many were stripped of their wealth, many were fugitives from their
   country, many were thrown destitute of counsel, many were tender and
   weak. [497] The condition of almost all was involved. So many cases of
   distress did not allow love to be inactive.

   To hope he assigns patience, as it is always conjoined with it, for
   what we hope for, we in patience wait for, (Romans 8:24) and the
   statement should be explained to mean, that Paul remembers their
   patience in hoping for the coming of Christ. From this we may gather a
   brief definition of true Christianity -- that it is a faith that is
   lively and full of vigor, so that it spares no labor, when assistance
   is to be given to one's neighbors, but, on the contrary, all the pious
   employ themselves diligently in offices of love, and lay out their
   efforts in them, so that, intent upon the hope of the manifestation of
   Christ, they despise everything else, and, armed with patience, they
   rise superior to the wearisomeness of length of time, as well as to all
   the temptations of the world.

   The clause, before our God and Father, may be viewed as referring to
   Paul's remembrance, or to the three things spoken immediately before. I
   explain it in this way. As he had spoken of his prayers, he declares
   that as often as he raises his thoughts to the kingdom of God, he, at
   the same time, recalls to his remembrance the faith, hope, and
   patience, of the Thessalonians, but as all mere presence must vanish
   when persons come into the presence of God, this is added, [498] in
   order that the affirmation may have more weight. Farther, by this
   declaration of his goodwill towards them he designed to make them more
   teachable and prepared to listen. [499]

   4 Knowing, brethren beloved. The participle knowing may apply to Paul
   as well as to the Thessalonians. Erasmus refers it to the
   Thessalonians. I prefer to follow Chrysostom, who understands it of
   Paul and his colleagues, for it is (as it appears to me) a more ample
   confirmation of the foregoing statement. For it tended in no small
   degree to recommend them -- that God himself had testified by many
   tokens, that they were acceptable and dear to him.

   Election of God. I am not altogether dissatisfied with the
   interpretation given by Chrysostom -- that God had made the
   Thessalonians illustrious, and had established their excellence. Paul,
   however, had it in view to express something farther; for he touches
   upon their calling, and as there had appeared in it no common marks of
   God's power, he infers from this that they had been specially called
   with evidences of a sure election. For the reason is immediately added
   -- that it was not a bare preaching that had been brought to them, but
   such as was conjoined with the efficacy of the Holy Spirit, that it
   might obtain entire credit among them.

   When he says, in power, and in the Holy Spirit, it is, in my opinion,
   as if he had said -- in the power of the Holy Spirit, so that the
   latter term is added as explanatory of the former. Assurance, to which
   he assigned the third place, was either in the thing itself, or in the
   disposition of the Thessalonians. I am rather inclined to think that
   the meaning is, that Paul's gospel had been confirmed by solid proofs,
   [500] as though God had shewn from heaven that he had ratified their
   calling. [501] When, however, Paul brings forward the proofs by which
   he had felt assured that the calling of the Thessalonians was
   altogether from God, he takes occasion at the same time to recommend
   his ministry, that they may themselves, also, recognize him and his
   colleagues as having been raised up by God.

   By the term power some understand miracles. I extend it farther, as
   referring to spiritual energy of doctrine. For, as we had occasion to
   see in the First Epistle to the Corinthians, Paul places it in contrast
   with speech [502] -- the voice of God, as it were, living and conjoined
   with effect, as opposed to an empty and dead eloquence of men. It is to
   be observed, however, that the election of God, which is in itself hid,
   is manifested by its marks--when he gathers to himself the lost sheep
   and joins them to his flock, and holds out his hand to those that were
   wandering and estranged from him. Hence a knowledge of our election
   must be sought from this source. As, however, the secret counsel of God
   is a labyrinth to those who disregard his calling, so those act
   perversely who, under pretext of faith and calling, darken this first
   grace, from which faith itself flows. "By faith," say they, "we obtain
   salvation: there is, therefore, no eternal predestination of God that
   distinguishes between us and reprobates." It is as though they said --
   "Salvation is of faith: there is, therefore, no grace of God that
   illuminates us in faith." Nay rather, as gratuitous election must be
   conjoined with calling, as with its effect, so it must necessarily, in
   the mean time, hold the first place. It matters little as to the sense,
   whether you connect hupo with the participle beloved or with the term
   election [503]

   5 As ye know. Paul, as I have said before, has it as his aim, that the
   Thessalonians, influenced by the same considerations, may entertain no
   doubt that they were elected by God. For it had been the design of God,
   in honoring Paul's ministry, that he might manifest to them their
   adoption. Accordingly, having said that they know what manner of
   persons they had been, [504] he immediately adds that he was such for
   their sake, by which he means that all this had been given them, in
   order that they might be fully persuaded that they were loved by God,
   and that their election was beyond all controversy.

   1 Thessalonians 1:6-8

   6. And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the
   word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost:

   6. Et vos imitatores nostri facti estis et Domini, dum sermonem amplexi
   estis in tribulatione multa, cum gaudio Spiritus sancti:

   7. So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and
   Achaia.

   7. Ita ut fueritis exemplaria omnibus credentibus in Macedonia et in
   Achaia.

   8. For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia
   and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread
   abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.

   8. A vobis enim personuit sermo Domini: nec in Macedonia tantum et in
   Achaia, sed etiam in omni loco, fides vestra quae in Deum est manavit:
   ita ut non opus habeamus quicquam loqui.


   6 And ye became imitators. With the view of increasing their alacrity,
   he declares that there is a mutual agreement, and harmony, as it were,
   between his preaching and their faith. For unless men, on their part,
   answer to God, no proficiency will follow from the grace that is
   offered to them -- not as though they could do this of themselves, but
   inasmuch as God, as he begins our salvation by calling us, perfects it
   also by fashioning our hearts to obedience. The sum, therefore, is this
   -- that an evidence of Divine election shewed itself not only in Paul's
   ministry, in so far as it was furnished with the power of the Holy
   Spirit, but also in the faith of the Thessalonians, so that this
   conformity is a powerful attestation of it. He says, however, "Ye were
   imitators of God and of us," in the same sense in which it is said,
   that the people believed God and his servant Moses, (Exodus 14:13 [505]
   ) not as though Paul and Moses had anything different from God, but
   because he wrought powerfully by them, as his ministers and
   instruments. [506] While ye embraced. Their readiness in receiving the
   gospel is called an imitation of God, for this reason, that as God had
   presented himself to the Thessalonians in a liberal spirit, so they
   had, on their part, voluntarily come forward to meet him.

   He says, with the joy of the Holy Spirit, that we may know that it is
   not by the instigation of the flesh, or by the promptings of their own
   nature, that men will be ready and eager to obey God, but that this is
   the work of God's Spirit. The circumstance, that amidst much
   tribulation they had embraced the gospel, serves by way of
   amplification. For we see very many, not otherwise disinclined to the
   gospel, who, nevertheless, avoid it, from being intimidated through
   fear of the cross. Those, accordingly, who do not hesitate with
   intrepidity to embrace along with the gospel the afflictions that
   threaten them, furnish in this an admirable example of magnanimity. And
   from this it is so much the more clearly apparent, how necessary it is
   that the Spirit should aid us in this. For the gospel cannot be
   properly, or sincerely received, unless it be with a joyful heart.
   Nothing, however, is more at variance with our natural disposition,
   than to rejoice in afflictions.

   7 So that ye were. Here we have another amplification -- that they had
   stirred up even believers by their example; for it is a great thing to
   get so decidedly the start of those who had entered upon the course
   before us, as to furnish assistance to them for prosecuting their
   course. Typus (the word made use of by Paul) is employed by the Greeks
   in the same sense as Exemplar is among the Latins, and Patron among the
   French. He says, then, that the courage of the Thessalonians had been
   so illustrious, that other believers had borrowed from them a rule of
   constancy. I preferred, however, to render it patterns, that I might
   not needlessly make any change upon the Greek phrase made use of by
   Paul; and farther, because the plural number expresses, in my opinion,
   something more than if he had said that that Church as a body had been
   set forward for imitation, for the meaning is, that there were as many
   patterns as there were individuals.

   8 For from you sounded forth. Here we have an elegant metaphor, by
   which he intimates that their faith was so lively, [507] that it did,
   as it were, by its sound, arouse other nations. For he says that the
   word of God sounded forth from them, inasmuch as their faith was
   sonorous [508] for procuring credit for the gospel. He says that this
   had not only occurred in neighboring places, but this sound had also
   extended far and wide, and had been distinctly heard, so that the
   matter did not require to be published by him. [509]

   1 Thessalonians 1:9-10

   9. For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had
   unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and
   true God;

   9. Ipsi enim de vobis annuntiant, qualem habuerimus ingressum ad vos:
   et quomodo conversi fueritis ad Deum ab idolis, ut serviretis Deo
   viventi et vero:

   10 And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead,
   even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.

   10. Et exspectaretis e cælis Filium eius, quem excitavit a mortuis,
   Iesum qui nos liberat ab ira ventura.


   He says that the report of their conversion had obtained great renown
   everywhere. What he mentions as to his entering in among them, refers
   to that power of the Spirit, by which God had signalized his gospel.
   [510] He says, however, that both things are freely reported among
   other nations, as things worthy of being made mention of. In the detail
   which follows, he shews, first, what the condition of mankind is,
   before the Lord enlightens them by the doctrine of his gospel; and
   farther, for what end he would have us instructed, and what is the
   fruit of the gospel. For although all do not worship idols, all are
   nevertheless addicted to idolatry, and are immersed in blindness and
   madness. Hence, it is owing to the kindness of God, that we are
   exempted from the impostures of the devil, and every kind of
   superstition. Some, indeed, he converts earlier, others later, but as
   alienation is common to all, it is necessary that we be converted to
   God, before we can serve God. From this, also, we gather the essence
   and nature of true faith, inasmuch as no one gives due credit to God
   but the man, who renouncing the vanity of his own understanding,
   embraces and receives the pure worship of God.

   9 To the living God. This is the end of genuine conversion. We see,
   indeed, that many leave off superstitions, who, nevertheless, after
   taking this step, are so far from making progress in piety, that they
   fall into what is worse. For having thrown off all regard to God, they
   give themselves up to a profane and brutal contempt. [511] Thus, in
   ancient times, the superstitions of the vulgar were derided by
   Epicurus, Diogenes the Cynic, and the like, but in such a way that they
   mixed up the worship of God so as to make no difference between it and
   absurd trifles. Hence we must take care, lest the pulling down of
   errors be followed by the overthrow of the building of faith. Farther,
   the Apostle, in ascribing to God the epithets true and living,
   indirectly censures idols as being dead and worthless inventions, and
   as being falsely called gods. He makes the end of conversion to be what
   I have noticed -- that they might serve God. Hence the doctrine of the
   gospel tends to this, that it may induce us to serve and obey God. For
   so long as we are the servants of sin, we are free from righteousness,
   (Romans 6:20) inasmuch as we sport ourselves, and wander up and down,
   exempt from any yoke. No one, therefore, is properly converted to God,
   but the man who has learned to place himself wholly under subjection to
   him.

   As, however, it is a thing that is more than simply difficult, in so
   great a corruption of our nature, he shews at the same time, what it is
   that retains and confirms us in the fear of God and obedience to him --
   waiting for Christ. For unless we are stirred up to the hope of eternal
   life, the world will quickly draw us to itself. For as it is only
   confidence in the Divine goodness that induces us to serve God, so it
   is only the expectation of final redemption that keeps us from giving
   way. [512] Let every one, therefore, that would persevere in a course
   of holy life, apply his whole mind to a expectation of Christ's coming.
   It is also worthy of notice, that he uses the expression waiting for
   Christ, instead of the hope of everlasting salvation. For,
   unquestionably, without Christ we are ruined and thrown into despair,
   but when Christ shews himself, life and prosperity do at the same time
   shine forth upon us. [513] Let us bear in mind, however, that this is
   said to believers exclusively, for as for the wicked, as he will come
   to be their Judge, so they can do nothing but tremble in looking for
   him.

   This is what he afterwards subjoins -- that Christ delivereth us from
   the wrath to come. For this is felt by none but those who, being
   reconciled to God by faith, have conscience already pacified;
   otherwise, [514] his name is dreadful. Christ, it is true, delivered us
   by his death from the anger of God, but the import of that deliverance
   will become apparent on the last day. [515] This statement, however,
   consists of two departments. The first is, that the wrath of God and
   everlasting destruction are impending over the human race, inasmuch as
   all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God. (Romans 3:23) The
   second is, that there is no way of escape but through the grace of
   Christ; for it is not without good grounds that Paul assigns to him
   this office. It is, however, an inestimable gift, that the pious,
   whenever mention is made of judgment, know that Christ will come as a
   Redeemer to them.

   In addition to this, he says emphatically, the wrath to come, that he
   may rouse up pious minds, lest they should fail from looking at the
   present life. For as faith is a looking at things that do not appear,
   (Hebrews 11:1) nothing is less befitting than that we should estimate
   the wrath of God, according as any one is afflicted in the world; as
   nothing is more absurd than to take hold of the transient blessings
   which we enjoy, that we may from them form an estimate of God's favor.
   While, therefore, on the one hand, the wicked sport themselves at their
   ease, and we, on the other hand, languish in misery, let us learn to
   fear the vengeance of God, which is hid from the eyes of flesh, and
   take our satisfaction in the secret delights of the spiritual life.
   [516]

   10 Whom he raised up. He makes mention here of Christ's resurrection,
   on which the hope of our resurrection is founded, for death everywhere
   besets us. Hence, unless we learn to look to Christ, our minds will
   give way at every turn. By the same consideration, he admonishes them
   that Christ is to be waited for from heaven, because we will find
   nothing in the world to bear us up, [517] while there are innumerable
   trials to overwhelm us. Another circumstance must be noticed; [518] for
   as Christ rose for this end -- that he might make us all at length, as
   being his members, partakers of the same glory with himself, Paul
   intimates that his resurrection would be vain, unless he again appeared
   as their Redeemer, and extended to the whole body of the Church the
   fruit and effect of that power which he manifested in himself. [519]

   CHAPTER 2
     __________________________________________________________________

   1 Thessalonians 2:1-4

   1. For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was
   not in vain:

   1. Ipsi enim nostis, fratres, quod ingressus noster ad vos non inanis
   fuerit:

   2. But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully
   entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak
   unto you the gospel of God with much contention.

   2. Imo quod persequutionem passi, et probro affecti Philippis (ut
   scitis) fiduciam sumpsimus in Deo nostro proferendi apud vos evangelium
   Dei, cum multo certamine.

   3. For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in
   guile:

   3. Nam exhortatio nostra, non ex impostura, neque ex immunditia, neque
   in dolo:

   4. But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel,
   even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our
   hearts.

   4. Sed quemadmodum probati fuimus a Deo, ut crederetur nobis
   evangelium, sic loquimur, non quasi hominibus placentes, sed Deo qui
   probat corda nostra.


   He now, leaving out of view the testimony of other Churches, reminds
   the Thessalonians of what they had themselves experienced, [520] and
   explains at large in what way he, and in like manner the two others,
   his associates, had conducted themselves among them, inasmuch as this
   was of the greatest importance for confirming their faith. For it is
   with this view that he declares his integrity -- that the Thessalonians
   may perceive that they had been called to the faith, not so much by a
   mortal man, as by God himself. He says, therefore, that his entering in
   unto them had not been vain, as ambitious persons manifest much show,
   while they have nothing of solidity; for he employs the word vain here
   as contrasted with efficacious

   He proves this by two arguments. The first is, that he had suffered
   persecution and ignominy at Philippi; the second is, that there was a
   great conflict prepared at Thessalonica. We know that the minds of men
   are weakened, nay, are altogether broken down by means of ignominy and
   persecutions. It was therefore an evidence of a Divine work that Paul,
   after having been subjected to evils of various kinds and to ignominy,
   did, as if in a perfectly sound state, shew no hesitation in making an
   attempt upon a large and opulent city, with the view of subjecting the
   inhabitants of it to Christ. In this entering in, nothing is seen that
   savors of vain ostentation. In the second department the same Divine
   power is beheld, for he does not discharge his duty with applause and
   favor, but required to maintain a keen conflict. In the mean time he
   stood firm and undaunted, from which it appears that he was held up
   [521] by the hand of God; for this is what he means when he says that
   he was emboldened. And, unquestionably, if all these circumstances are
   carefully considered, it cannot be denied that God there magnificently
   displayed his power. As to the history, it is to be found in the
   sixteenth and seventeenth chapters of the Acts. [Acts 16 17.]

   3 For our exhortation. He confirms, by another argument, the
   Thessalonians in the faith which they had embraced -- inasmuch as they
   had been faithfully and purely instructed in the word of the Lord, for
   he maintains that his doctrine was free from all deception and
   uncleanness. And with the view of placing this matter beyond all doubt,
   he calls their conscience to witness. The three terms which he makes
   use of may, it would seem, be distinguished in this manner: imposture
   may refer to the substance of doctrine, uncleanness to the affections
   of the heart, guile to the manner of acting. In the first place,
   therefore, he says that they had not been deluded or imposed upon by
   fallacies, when they embraced the kind of doctrine that had been
   delivered to them by him. Secondly, he declares his integrity, inasmuch
   as he had not come to them under the influence of any impure desire,
   but actuated solely by upright disposition. Thirdly, he says that he
   had done nothing fraudulently or maliciously, but had, on the contrary,
   manifested a simplicity befitting a minister of Christ. As these things
   were well known to the Thessalonians, they had a sufficiently firm
   foundation for their faith.

   4 As we have been approved. He goes even a step higher, for he appeals
   to God as the Author of his apostleship, and he reasons in this manner:
   "God, when he assigned me this office, bore witness to me as a faithful
   servant; there is no reason, therefore, why men should have doubts as
   to my fidelity, which they know to have been approved of by God. Paul,
   however, does not glory in having been approved of, as though he were
   such of himself; for he does not dispute here as to what he had by
   nature, nor does he place his own power in collision with the grace of
   God, but simply says that the Gospel had been committed to him as a
   faithful and approved servant. Now, God approves of those whom he has
   formed for himself according to his own pleasure.

   Not as pleasing men. What is meant by pleasing men has been explained
   in the Epistle to the Galatians, (Galatians 1:10) and this passage,
   also, shews it admirably. For Paul contrasts pleasing men, and pleasing
   God, as things that are opposed to each other. Farther, when he says --
   God, who trieth our hearts, he intimates, that those who endeavor to
   obtain the favor of men, are not influenced by an upright conscience,
   and do nothing from the heart. Let us know, therefore, that true
   ministers of the gospel ought to make it their aim to devote to God
   their endeavors, and to do it from the heart, not from any outward
   regard to the world, but because conscience tells them that it is right
   and proper. Thus it will be secured that they will not make it their
   aim to please men, that is, that they will not act under the influence
   of ambition, with a view to the favor of men.

   1 Thessalonians 2:5-8

   5. For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a
   cloke of covetousness; God is witness:

   5. Neque enim unquam in sermone adulationis fuimus, quemadmodum nostis,
   neque in occasione avaritiae: Deus testis.

   6. Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when
   we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.

   6. Nec quaesivimus ab hominibus gloriam, neque a vobis, neque ab aliis.

   7. But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her
   children:

   7. Quum possemus in pondere esse tanquam Christi Apostoli, facti tamen
   sumus mites in medio vestri, perinde acsi nutrix aleret filios suos.

   8. So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have
   imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls,
   because ye were dear unto us.

   8. Ita erga vos affecti, libenter voluissemus distribuere vobis non
   solum Evangelium Dei, sed nostras ipsorum animas, propterea quod cari
   nobis facti estis.


   5 For neither have we ever. It is not without good reason that he
   repeats it so frequently, that the Thessalonians knew that what he
   states is true. For there is not a surer attestation, than the
   experience of those with whom we speak. And this was of the greatest
   importance to them, because Paul relates with what integrity he had
   conducted himself, with no other intention, than that his doctrine may
   have the greater respect, for the building up of their faith. It is,
   however, a confirmation of the foregoing statement, for he that is
   desirous to please men, must of necessity stoop shamefully to flattery,
   while he that is intent upon duty with an earnest and upright
   disposition, will keep at a distance from all appearance of flattery.

   When he adds, nor for an occasion of covetousness, he means that he had
   not, in teaching among them, been in quest of anything in the way of
   personal gain. Prophasis is employed by the Greeks to mean both
   occasion and pretext, but the former signification suits better with
   the passage, so as to be, as it were, a trap. [522] "I have not abused
   the gospel so as to make it an occasion of catching at gain." As,
   however, the malice of men has so many winding retreats, that avarice
   and ambition frequently lie concealed, he on this account calls God to
   witness. Now, he makes mention here of two vices, from which he
   declares himself to be exempt, and, in doing so, teaches that the
   servants of Christ should stand aloof from them. Thus, if we would
   distinguish the genuine servants of Christ from those that are
   pretended and spurious, they must be tried according to this rule, and
   every one that would serve Christ aright must also conform his aims and
   his actions to the same rule. For where avarice and ambition reign,
   innumerable corruptions follow, and the whole man passes away into
   vanity, for these are the two sources from which the corruption of the
   whole ministry takes its rise.

   6 When we might have exercised authority. Some interpret it--when we
   might have been burdensome, that is, might have loaded you with
   expense, but the connection requires that to baru should be taken to
   mean authority. For Paul says that he was so far removed from vain
   pomp, from boasting, from arrogance, that he even waived his just
   claim, so far as the maintenance of authority was concerned. For
   inasmuch as he was an Apostle of Christ, he deserved to be received
   with a higher degree of respect, but he had refrained from all show of
   dignity, [523] as though he had been some minister of the common rank.
   From this it appears how far removed he was from haughtiness. [524]

   What we have rendered mild, the old translator renders Fuimus parvuli,
   (we have been little,) [525] but the reading which I have followed is
   more generally received among the Greeks; but whichever you may take,
   there can be no doubt that he makes mention of his voluntary abasement.
   [526]

   As if a nurse. In this comparison he takes in two points that he had
   touched upon -- that he had sought neither glory nor gain among the
   Thessalonians. For a mother in nursing her infant shews nothing of
   power or dignity. Paul says that he was such, inasmuch as he
   voluntarily refrained from claiming the honor that was due to him, and
   with calmness and modesty stooped to every kind of office. Secondly, a
   mother in nursing her children manifests a certain rare and wonderful
   affection, inasmuch as she spares no labor and trouble, shuns no
   anxiety, is wearied out by no assiduity, and even with cheerfulness of
   spirit gives her own blood to be sucked. In the same way, Paul declares
   that he was so disposed towards the Thessalonians, that he was prepared
   to lay out his life for their benefit. This, assuredly, was not the
   conduct of a man that was sordid or avaricious, but of one that
   exercised a disinterested affection, and he expresses this in the close
   -- because ye were dear unto us In the mean time, we must bear in mind,
   that all that would be ranked among true pastors must exercise this
   disposition of Paul--to have more regard to the welfare of the Church
   than to their own life, and not be impelled to duty by a regard to
   their own advantage, but by a sincere love to those to whom they know
   that they are conjoined, and laid under obligation. [527]

   1 Thessalonians 2:9-12

   9. For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring
   night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we
   preached unto you the gospel of God.

   9. Memoria enim tenetis, fratres, laborem nostrum et sudorem: nam die
   ac nocte opus facientes, ne gravaremus quenquam vestrum, praedicavimus
   apud vos Evangelium Dei.

   10. Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and
   unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:

   10. Vos testes estis et Deus, ut sancte, et iuste, et sine querela
   vobis, qui creditis, fuerimus.

   11. As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of
   you, as a father doth his children,

   11. Quemadmodum nostis, ut unumquemque vestrum, quasi pater suos
   liberos,

   12. That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his
   kingdom and glory.

   12. Exhortati simus, et monuerimus et obtestati simus, ut ambularetis
   digne Deo, qui vocavit vos in suum regnum et gloriam.


   9 For ye remember. These things tend to confirm what he had stated
   previously -- that to spare them he did not spare himself. He must
   assuredly have burned with a wonderful and more than human zeal,
   inasmuch as, along with the labor of teaching, he labors with his hand
   as an operative, with the view of earning a livelihood, and in this
   respect, also, refrained from exercising his right. For it is the law
   of Christ, as he also teaches elsewhere, (1 Corinthians 9:14) that
   every church furnish its ministers with food and other necessaries.
   Paul, therefore, in laying no burden upon the Thessalonians, does
   something more than could, from the requirements of his office, have
   been required from him. In addition to this, he does not merely refrain
   from incurring public expense, but avoids burdening any one
   individually. Farther, there can be no doubt, that he was influenced by
   some good and special consideration in thus refraining from exercising
   his right, [528] for in other churches he exercised, equally with
   others, the liberty allowed him. [529] He received nothing from the
   Corinthians, lest he should give the false apostles a handle for
   glorying as to this matter. In the mean time, he did not hesitate to
   ask [530] from other churches, what was needed by him, for he writes
   that, while he bestowed labor upon the Corinthians, free of charge, he
   robbed the Churches that he did not serve. (2 Corinthians 11:8) [531]
   Hence, although the reason is not expressed here, we may, nevertheless,
   conjecture that the ground on which Paul was unwilling that his
   necessities should be ministered to, was -- lest such a thing should
   put any hindrance in the way of the gospel. For this, also, ought to be
   matter of concern to good pastors -- that they may not merely run with
   alacrity in their ministry, but may, so far as is in their power,
   remove all hindrances in the way of their course.

   10 Ye are witnesses. He again calls God and them to witness, with the
   view of affirming his integrity, and cites, on the one hand, God as a
   witness of his conscience, and them, [532] on the other hand, as
   witnesses of what they had known by experience. How holily, says he,
   and justly, that is, with how sincere a fear of God, and with what
   fidelity and blamelessness towards men; and thirdly, unreproachably, by
   which he means that he had given no occasion of complaint or obloquy.
   For the servants of Christ cannot avoid calumnies, and unfavorable
   reports; for being hated by the world, they must of necessity be
   evil-spoken of among the wicked. Hence he restricts this to believers,
   who judge uprightly and sincerely, and do not revile malignantly and
   groundlessly.

   11 Every one as a father. He insists more especially on those things
   which belong to his office. He has compared himself to a nurse: he now
   compares himself to a father. What he means is this -- that he was
   concerned in regard to them, just as a father is wont to be as to his
   sons, and that he had exercised a truly paternal care in instructing
   and admonishing them. And, unquestionably, no one will ever be a good
   pastor, unless he shews himself to be a father to the Church that is
   committed to him. Nor does he merely declare himself to be such to the
   entire body, [533] but even to the individual members. For it is not
   enough that a pastor in the pulpit teach all in common, if he does not
   add also particular instruction, according as necessity requires, or
   occasion offers. Hence Paul himself, in Acts 20:26, declares himself to
   be free from the blood of all men, because he did not cease to admonish
   all publicly, and also individually in private in their own houses. For
   instruction given in common is sometimes of little service, and some
   cannot be corrected or cured without particular medicine.

   12 Exhorted. He shews with what earnestness he devoted himself to their
   welfare, for he relates that in preaching to them respecting piety
   towards God and the duties of the Christian life, it had not been
   merely in a perfunctory way, [534] but he says that he had made use of
   exhortations and adjurations. It is a lively preaching of the gospel,
   when persons are not merely told what is right, but are pricked (Acts
   2:37) by exhortations, and are called to the judgment-seat of God, that
   they may not fall asleep in their vices, for this is what is properly
   meant by adjuring. But if pious men, whose promptitude Paul so highly
   commends, stood in absolute need of being stimulated by stirring
   exhortations, nay, adjurations, what must be done with us, in whom
   sluggishness [535] of the flesh does more reign? In the mean time, as
   to the wicked, whose obstinacy is incurable, it is necessary to
   denounce upon them the horrible vengeance of God, not so much from hope
   of success, as in order that they may be rendered inexcusable.

   Some render the participle paramuthoumenoi, comforted. If we adopt this
   rendering, he means that he made use of consolations in dealing with
   the afflicted, who need to be sustained by the grace of God, and
   refreshed by tasting of heavenly blessings, [536] that they may not
   lose heart or become impatient. The other meaning, however, is more
   suitable to the context, that he admonished; for the three verbs, it is
   manifest, refer to the same thing.

   That ye might walk. He presents in a few words the sum and substance of
   his exhortations, that, in magnifying the mercy of God, he admonished
   them not to fail as to their calling. His commendation of the grace of
   God is contained in the expression, who hath called us into his
   kingdom. For as our salvation is founded upon God's gracious adoption,
   every blessing that Christ has brought us is comprehended in this one
   term. It now remains that we answer God's call, that is, that we shew
   ourselves to be such children to him as he is a Father to us. For he
   who lives otherwise than as becomes a child of God, deserves to be cut
   off from God's household.

   1 Thessalonians 2:13-16

   13. For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye
   received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as
   the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which
   effectually worketh also in you that believe.

   13 Quapropter nos quoque indesinenter gratias agimus Deo, quod, quum
   sermonem Dei praedicatum a nobis percepistis, amplexi estis, non ut
   sermonem hominum, sed quemadmodum revera est, sermonem Dei: qui etiam
   efficaciter agit in vobis credentibus.

   14. For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in
   Judea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of
   your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:

   14. Vos enim imitatores facti estis, fratres, Ecclesiarum Dei, quae
   sunt in Iudaea in Christo Iesu: quia eadem passi estis et vos a
   propriis tribulibus, quemadmodum et ipsi a Iudaeis.

   15. Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have
   persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:

   15. Qui Dominum Iesum occiderunt, et proprios Prophetas, et nos
   persequuti sunt, et Deo non placent, et cunctis hominibus adversi sunt:

   16. Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to
   fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the
   uttermost.

   16. Qui obsistunt ne Gentibus loquamur, ut salvae fiant, ut compleantur
   eorum peccata semper: pervenit enim in eos ira usque in finem.


   13 Wherefore we give thanks. Having spoken of his ministry, he returns
   again to address the Thessalonians, that he may always commend that
   mutual harmony of which he has previously made mention. [537] He says,
   therefore, that he gives thanks to God, because they had embraced the
   word of God which they heard from his mouth, as the word of God, as it
   truly was. Now, by these expressions he means, that it has been
   received by them reverently, and with the obedience with which it
   ought. For so soon as this persuasion has gained a footing, it is
   impossible but that a feeling of obligation to obey takes possession of
   our minds. [538] For who would not shudder at the thought of resisting
   God? Who would not regard contempt of God with detestation? The
   circumstance, therefore, that the word of God is regarded by many with
   such contempt, that it is scarcely held in any estimation -- that many
   are not at all actuated by fear, arises from this, that they do not
   consider that they have to do with God.

   Hence we learn from this passage what credit ought to be given to the
   gospel -- such as does not depend on the authority of men, but, resting
   on the sure and ascertained truth of God, raises itself above the
   world; and, in fine, is as far above mere opinion, as heaven is above
   earth: [539] and, secondly, such as produces of itself reverence, fear,
   and obedience, inasmuch as men, touched with a feeling of Divine
   majesty, will never allow themselves to sport with it. Teachers [540]
   are, in their turn, admonished to beware of bringing forward anything
   but the pure word of God, for if this was not allowable for Paul, it
   will not be so for any one in the present day. He proves, however, from
   the effect produced, that it was the word of God that he had delivered,
   inasmuch as it had produced that fruit of heavenly doctrine which the
   Prophets celebrate, (Isaiah 55:11,13; Jeremiah 23:29) in renewing their
   life, [541] for the doctrine of men could accomplish no such thing. The
   relative pronoun may be taken as referring either to God or to his
   word, but whichever way you choose, the meaning will come all to one,
   for as the Thessalonians felt in themselves a Divine energy, which
   proceeded from faith, they might rest assured that what they had heard
   was not a mere sound of the human voice vanishing into air, but the
   living and efficacious doctrine of God.

   As to the expression, the word of the preaching of God, it means
   simply, as I have rendered it, the word of God preached by man. For
   Paul meant to state expressly that they had not looked upon the
   doctrine as contemptible, although it had proceeded from the mouth of a
   mortal man, inasmuch as they recognized God as the author of it. He
   accordingly praises the Thessalonians, because they did not rest in
   mere regard for the minister. but lifted up their eyes to God, that
   they might receive his word. Accordingly, I have not hesitated to
   insert the particle ut, (that,) which served to make the meaning more
   clear. There is a mistake on the part of Erasmus in rendering it, "the
   word of the hearing of God," as if Paul meant that God had been
   manifested. He afterwards changed it thus, "the word by which you
   learned God," for he did not advert to the Hebrew idiom. [542]

   14 For ye became imitators. If you are inclined to restrict this to the
   clause in immediate connection with it, the meaning will be, that the
   power of God, or of his word, shews itself in their patient endurance,
   while they sustain persecutions with magnanimity and undaunted courage.
   I prefer, however, to view it as extending to the whole of the
   foregoing statement, for he confirms what he has stated, that the
   Thessalonians had in good earnest embraced the gospel, as being
   presented to them by God, inasmuch as they courageously endured the
   assaults which Satan made upon them, and did not refuse to suffer
   anything rather than leave off obedience to it. And, unquestionably,
   this is no slight test of faith when Satan, by all his machinations,
   has no success in moving us away from the fear of God.

   In the mean time, he prudently provides against a dangerous temptation
   which might prostrate or harass them; for they endured grievous
   troubles from that nation which was the only one in the world that
   gloried in the name of God.

   This, I say, might occur to their minds: "If this is the true religion,
   why do the Jews, who are the sacred people of God, oppose it with such
   inveterate hostility?" With the view of removing this occasion of
   offense, [543] he, in the first place, shews them that they have this
   in common with the first Churches that were in Judea: afterwards, he
   says that the Jews are determined enemies of God and of all sound
   doctrine. For although, when he says that they suffered from their own
   countrymen, this may be explained as referring to others rather than to
   the Jews, or at least ought not to be restricted to the Jews
   exclusively, yet as he insists farther in describing their obstinacy
   and impiety, it is manifest that these same persons are adverted to by
   him from the beginning. It is probable, that at Thessalonica some from
   that nation were converted to Christ. It appears, however, from the
   narrative furnished in the Acts, that there, no less than in Judea, the
   Jews were persecutors of the gospel. I accordingly take this as being
   said indiscriminately of Jews as well as of Gentiles, inasmuch as both
   endured great conflicts and fierce attacks from their own countrymen

   15 Who killed the Lord Jesus. As that people had been distinguished by
   so many benefits from God, in consequence of the glory of the ancient
   fathers, the very name [544] was of great authority among many. Lest
   this disguise should dazzle the eyes of any one, he strips the Jews of
   all honor, so as to leave them nothing but odium and the utmost infamy.

   "Behold," says he, "the virtues for which they deserve praise among the
   good and pious! -- they killed their own prophets and at last the Son
   of God, they have persecuted me his servant, they wage war with God,
   they are detested by the whole world, they are hostile to the salvation
   of the Gentiles; in fine, they are destined to everlasting
   destruction."

   It is asked, why he says that Christ and the prophets were killed by
   the same persons? I answer, that this refers to the entire body, [545]
   for Paul means that there is nothing new or unusual in their resisting
   God, but that, on the contrary, they are, in this manner, filling up
   the measure of their fathers, as Christ speaks. (Matthew 23:32)

   16 Who hinder us from speaking to the Gentiles. It is not without good
   reason that, as has been observed, he enters so much into detail in
   exposing the malice of the Jews. [546] For as they furiously opposed
   the Gospel everywhere, there arose from this a great stumblingblock,
   more especially as they exclaimed that the gospel was profaned by Paul,
   when he published it among the Gentiles. By this calumny they made
   divisions in the Churches, they took away from the Gentiles the hope of
   salvation, and they obstructed the progress of the gospel. Paul,
   accordingly, charges them with this crime -- that they regard the
   salvation of the Gentiles with envy, but adds, that matters are so, in
   order that their sins may be filled up, that he may take away from them
   all reputation for piety; just as in saying previously, that they
   pleased not God, (1 Thessalonians 2:15) he meant, that they were
   unworthy to be reckoned among the worshippers of God. The manner of
   expression, however, must be observed, implying that those who
   persevere in an evil course fill up by this means the measure of their
   judgment, [547] until they come to make it a heap. This is the reason
   why the punishment of the wicked is often delayed -- because their
   impieties, so to speak, are not yet ripe. By this we are warned that we
   must carefully take heed lest, in the event of our adding from time to
   time [548] sin to sin, as is wont to happen generally, the heap at last
   reaches as high as heaven.

   For wrath has come. He means that they are in an utterly hopeless
   state, inasmuch as they are vessels of the Lord's wrath. "The just
   vengeance of God presses upon them and pursues them, and will not leave
   them until they perish -- as is the case with all the reprobate, who
   rush on headlong to death, to which they are destined." The Apostle,
   however, makes this declaration as to the entire body of the people, in
   such a manner as not to deprive the elect of hope. For as the greater
   proportion resisted Christ, he speaks, it is true, of the whole nation
   generally, but we must keep in view the exception which he himself
   makes in Romans 11:5, -- that the Lord will always have some seed
   remaining. We must always keep in view Paul's design -- that believers
   must carefully avoid the society of those whom the just vengeance of
   God pursues, until they perish in their blind obstinacy. Wrath, without
   any additional term, means the judgment of God, as in Romans 4:15, --
   the law worketh wrath; also in Romans 12:19, -- neither give place unto
   wrath

   1 Thessalonians 2:17-20

   17. But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in
   presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your
   face with great desire.

   17. Nos vero, fratres, orbati vobis ad tempus horae [549] aspectu, non
   corde, abundantius studuimus faciem vestram videre in multo desiderio.

   18. Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again;
   but Satan hindered us.

   18. Itaque voluimus venire ad vos, ego quidem Paulus, et semel et bis,
   et obstitit nobis Satan.

   19. For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even
   ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?

   19. Quae enim nostra spes, vel gaudium, vel corona gloriationis? annon
   etiam vos coram Domino nostro Iesu Christo in eius adventu?

   20. For ye are our glory and joy.

   20. Vos enim estis gloria nostra et gaudium.


   17 But we, brethren, bereaved of you. This excuse has been
   appropriately added, lest the Thessalonians should think that Paul had
   deserted them while so great an emergency demanded his presence. He has
   spoken of the persecutions which they endured from their own people:
   he, in the mean time, whose duty it was above all others to assist
   them, was absent. He has formerly called himself a father; now, it is
   not the part of a father to desert his children in the midst of such
   distresses. He, accordingly, obviates all suspicion of contempt and
   negligence, by saying, that it was from no want of inclination, but
   because he had not opportunity. Nor does he say simply, "I was desirous
   to come to you, but my way was obstructed;" but by the peculiar terms
   that he employs he expresses the intensity of his affection: "When,"
   says he, "I was bereaved of you." [550] By the word bereaved, he
   declares how sad and distressing a thing it was to him to be absent
   from them. [551] This is followed by a fuller expression of his feeling
   of desire -- that it was with difficulty that he could endure their
   absence for a short time. It is not to be wondered, if length of time
   should occasion weariness or sadness; but we must have a strong feeling
   of attachment when we find it difficult to wait even a single hour.
   Now, by the space of an hour, he means -- a small space of time.

   This is followed by a correction -- that he had been separated from
   them in appearance, not in heart, that they may know that distance of
   place does not by any means lessen his attachment. At the same time,
   this might not less appropriately be applied to the Thessalonians, as
   meaning that they, on their part, had felt united in mind while absent
   in body; for it was of no small importance for the point in hand that
   he should state how fully assured he was of their affection towards him
   in return. He shews, however, more fully his affection, when he says
   that he endeavored the more abundantly; for he means that his affection
   was so far from being diminished by his leaving them, that it had been
   the more inflamed. When he says, we would once and again, he declares
   that it was not a sudden heat, that quickly cooled, (as we see
   sometimes happen,) but that he had been steadfast in this purpose,
   [552] inasmuch as he sought various opportunities.

   18 Satan hindered us. Luke relates that Paul was in one instance
   hindered, (Acts 20:3) inasmuch as the Jews laid an ambush for him in
   the way. The same thing, or something similar, may have occurred
   frequently. It is not without good reason, however, that Paul ascribes
   the whole of this to Satan, for, as he teaches elsewhere, (Ephesians
   6:12) we have to

   wrestle not with flesh and blood, but with principalities of the air,
   and spiritual wickednesses, etc.

   For, whenever the wicked molest us, they fight under Satan's banner,
   and are his instruments for harassing us. More especially, when our
   endeavors are directed to the work of the Lord, it is certain that
   everything that hinders proceeds from Satan; and would to God that this
   sentiment were deeply impressed upon the minds of all pious persons --
   that Satan is continually contriving, by every means, in what way he
   may hinder or obstruct the edification of the Church! We would
   assuredly be more careful to resist him; we would take more care to
   maintain sound doctrine, of which that enemy strives so keenly to
   deprive us. We would also, whenever the course of the gospel is
   retarded, know whence the hindrance proceeds. He says elsewhere,
   (Romans 1:13) that God had not permitted him, but both are true: for
   although Satan does his part, yet God retains supreme authority, so as
   to open up a way for us, as often as he sees good, against Satan's
   will, and in spite of his opposition. Paul accordingly says truly that
   God does not permit, although the hindrance comes from Satan.

   19 For what is our hope. He confirms that ardor of desire, of which he
   had made mention, inasmuch as he has his happiness in a manner
   treasured up in them. "Unless I forget myself, I must necessarily
   desire your presence, for ye are our glory and joy." Farther, when he
   calls them his hope and the crown of his glory, we must not understand
   this as meaning that he gloried in any one but God alone, but because
   we are allowed to glory in all God's favors, in their own place, in
   such a manner that he is always our object of aim, as I have explained
   more at large in the first Epistle to the Corinthians. [553] We must,
   however, infer from this, that Christ's ministers will, on the last
   day, according as they have individually promoted his kingdom, be
   partakers of glory and triumph. Let them therefore now learn to rejoice
   and glory in nothing but the prosperous issue of their labors, when
   they see that the glory of Christ is promoted by their instrumentality.
   The consequence will be, that they will be actuated by that spirit of
   affection to the Church with which they ought. The particle also
   denotes that the Thessalonians were not the only persons in whom Paul
   triumphed, but that they held a place among many. The causal particle
   gar, (for,) which occurs almost immediately afterwards, is employed
   here not in its strict sense, by way of affirmation--"assuredly you
   are."

   1 Thessalonians 3:1-5

   1. Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be
   left at Athens alone;

   1. Quare non amplius sufferentes censuimus, ut Athenis relinqueremur
   soli:

   2. And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our
   fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to
   comfort you concerning your faith:

   2. Et misimus Timotheum fratrem nostrum, et ministrum Dei, et
   cooperarium nostrum in evangelio Christi, ut confirmaret vos, et vobis
   animum adderet ex fide nostra,

   3. That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves
   know that we are appointed thereunto.

   3. Ut nemo turbaretur in his afflictionibus: ipsi enim nostis quod in
   hoc sumus constituti.

   4. For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should
   suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.

   4. Etenim quum essemus apud vos, praediximus vobis quod essemus
   afflictiones passuri; quemadmodum etiam accidit, et nostis.

   5. For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your
   faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour
   be in vain.

   5. Quamobrem et ego non amplius sustinens, misi ut cognoscerem fidem
   vestram: ne forte tentasset vos, is qui tentat, et exinanitus esset
   labor noster.


   1 Wherefore, when we could no longer endure. By the detail which
   follows, he assures them of the desire of which he had spoken. For if,
   on being detained elsewhere, he had sent no other to Thessalonica in
   his place, it might have seemed as though he were not so much concerned
   in regard to them; but when he substitutes Timothy in his place, he
   removes that suspicion, more especially when he prefers them before
   himself. Now that he esteemed them above himself, he shews from this,
   that he chose rather to be left alone than that they should be
   deserted: for these words, we judged it good to be left alone, are
   emphatic. Timothy was a most faithful companion to him: he had at that
   time no others with him; hence it was inconvenient and distressing for
   him to be without him. It is therefore a token of rare affection and
   anxious desire that he does not refuse to deprive himself of all
   comfort, with the view of relieving the Thessalonians. To the same
   effect is the word eudokesamen, which expresses a prompt inclination of
   the mind. [554]

   2 Our brother. He assigns to him these marks of commendation, that he
   may shew the more clearly how much inclined he was to consult their
   welfare: for if he had sent them some common person, it could not have
   afforded them much assistance; and inasmuch as Paul would have done
   this without inconvenience to himself, he would have given no
   remarkable proof of his fatherly concern in regard to them. It is, on
   the other hand, a great thing that he deprives himself of a brother and
   fellow-laborer, and one to whom, as he declares in Philippians 2:20, he
   found no equal, inasmuch as all aimed at the promotion of their own
   interests. In the mean time, [555] he procures authority for the
   doctrine which they had received from Timothy, that it may remain the
   more deeply impressed upon their memory.

   It is, however, with good reason that he says that he had sent Timothy
   with this view -- that they might receive a confirmation of their faith
   from his example. They might be intimidated by unpleasant reports as to
   persecutions; but Paul's undaunted constancy was fitted so much the
   more to animate them, so as to keep them from giving way. And,
   assuredly, the fellowship which ought to subsist between the saints and
   members of Christ extends even thus far -- that the faith of one is the
   consolation of others. Thus, when the Thessalonians heard that Paul was
   going on with indefatigable zeal, and was by strength of faith
   surmounting all dangers and all difficulties, and that his faith
   continued everywhere victorious against Satan and the world, this
   brought them no small consolation. More especially we are, or at least
   ought to be, stimulated by the examples of those by whom we were
   instructed in the faith, as is stated in the end of the Epistle to the
   Hebrews. (Hebrews 13:7) Paul, accordingly, means that they ought to be
   fortified by his example, so as not to give way under their
   afflictions. As, however, they might have been offended if Paul had
   entertained a fear lest they should all give way under persecutions,
   (inasmuch as this would have been an evidence of excessive distrust,)
   he mitigates this harshness by saying -- lest any one, or, that no one.
   There was, however, good reason to fear this, as there are always some
   weak persons in every society.

   3 For ye yourselves know. As all would gladly exempt themselves from
   the necessity of bearing the cross, Paul teaches that there is no
   reason why believers should feel dismayed on occasion of persecutions,
   as though it were a thing that was new and unusual, inasmuch as this is
   our condition, which the Lord has assigned to us. For this manner of
   expression -- we are appointed to it -- is as though he had said, that
   we are Christians on this condition. He says, however, that they know
   it, because it became them to fight the more bravely, [556] inasmuch as
   they had been forewarned in time. In addition to this, incessant
   afflictions made Paul contemptible among rude and ignorant persons. On
   this account he states that nothing had befallen him but what he had
   long before, in the manner of a prophet, foretold.

   5 Lest perhaps the tempter has tempted you. By this term he teaches us
   that temptations are always to be dreaded, because it is the proper
   office of Satan to tempt. As, however, he never ceases to place
   ambushes for us on all sides, and to lay snares for us all around, so
   we must be on our watch, eagerly taking heed. And now he says openly
   what in the outset he had avoided saying, as being too harsh -- that he
   had felt concerned lest his labors should be vain, if, peradventure,
   Satan should prevail. And this he does that they may be carefully upon
   their watch, and may stir themselves up the more vigorously to
   resistance.

   1 Thessalonians 3:6-10

   6. But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good
   tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of
   us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:

   6. Nuper autem quum venisset Timotheus ad nos a vobis, et annuntiasset
   nobis fidem et dilectionem vestram, et quod bonam nostri memoriam
   habetis semper, desiderantes nos videre, quemadmodum et nos ipsi vos:

   7. Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our
   affliction and distress by your faith:

   7. Inde consolationem percepimus fratres de vobis, in omni tribulatione
   et necessitate nostra per vestram fidem:

   8. For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.

   8. Quia nunc vivimus, si vos stasis in Domino.

   9. For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy
   wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;

   9. Quam enim gratiarum actionem possumus Deo reddere de vobis, in omni
   gaudio quod gaudemus propter vos coram Deo nostro;

   10. Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and
   might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?

   10. Nocte ac die supra modum precantes, ut videamus faciem vestram, et
   suppleamus quae fidei vestrae desunt?


   He shews here, by another argument, by what an extraordinary affection
   he was actuated towards them, inasmuch as he was transported almost out
   of his senses by the joyful intelligence of their being in a prosperous
   condition. For we must take notice of the circumstances which he
   relates. He was in affliction and necessity: there might have seemed,
   therefore, no room for cheerfulness. But when he hears what was much
   desired by him respecting the Thessalonians, as though all feeling of
   his distresses had been extinguished, he is carried forward to joy and
   congratulation. At the same time he proceeds, by degrees, in expressing
   the greatness of his joy, for he says, in the first place, we received
   consolation: afterwards he speaks of a joy that was plentifully poured
   forth. [557] This congratulation, [558] however, has the force of an
   exhortation; and Paul's intention was to stir up the Thessalonians to
   perseverance. And, assuredly, this must have been a most powerful
   excitement, when they learned that the holy Apostle felt so great
   consolation and joy from the advancement of their piety.

   6 Faith and love. This form of expression should be the more carefully
   observed by us in proportion to the frequency with which it is made use
   of by Paul, for in these two words he comprehends briefly the entire
   sum of true piety. Hence all that aim at this twofold mark during their
   whole life are beyond all risk of erring: all others, however much they
   may torture themselves, wander miserably. The third thing that he adds
   as to their good remembrance of him, refers to respect entertained for
   the Gospel. For it was on no other account that they held Paul in such
   affection and esteem.

   8 For now we live. Here it appears still more clearly that Paul almost
   forgot himself for the sake of the Thessalonians, or, at least, making
   regard for himself a mere secondary consideration, devoted his first
   and chief thoughts to them. At the same time he did not do that so much
   from affection to men as from a desire for the Lord's glory. For zeal
   for God and Christ glowed in his holy breast to such a degree that it
   in a manner swallowed up all other anxieties. "We live," says he, that
   is, "we are in good health, if you persevere in the Lord." And under
   the adverb now, he repeats what he had formerly stated, that he had
   been greatly pressed down by affliction and necessity; yet he declares
   that whatever evil he endures in his own person does not hinder his
   joy. "Though in myself I am dead, yet in your welfare I live." By this
   all pastors are admonished what sort of connection ought to subsist
   between them and the Church -- that they reckon themselves happy when
   it goes well with the Church, although they should be in other respects
   encompassed with many miseries, and, on the other hand, that they pine
   away with grief and sorrow if they see the building which they have
   constructed in a state of decay, although matters otherwise should be
   joyful and prosperous.

   9 For what thanksgiving. Not satisfied with a simple affirmation, he
   intimates how extraordinary is the greatness of his joy, by asking
   himself what thanks he can render to God; for by speaking thus he
   declares that he cannot find an expression of gratitude that can come
   up to the measure of his joy. He says that he rejoices before God, that
   is, truly and without any pretense.

   10 Praying beyond measure. He returns to an expression of his desire.
   For it is never allowable for us to congratulate men, while they live
   in this world, in such unqualified terms as not always to desire
   something better for them. For they are as yet in the way: they may
   fall back, or go astray, or even go back. Hence Paul is desirous to
   have opportunity given him of supplying what is wanting in the faith of
   the Thessalonians, or, which is the same thing, completing in all its
   parts their faith, which was as yet imperfect. Yet this is the faith
   which he had previously extolled marvelously. But from this we infer,
   that those who far surpass others are still far distant from the goal.
   Hence, whatever progress we may have made, let us always keep in view
   our deficiencies, (husteremata,) [559] that we may not be reluctant to
   aim at something farther.

   From this also it appears how necessary it is for us to give careful
   attention to doctrine, for teachers [560] were not appointed merely
   with the view of leading men, in the course of a single day or month,
   to the faith of Christ, but for the purpose of perfecting the faith
   which has been begun. But as to Paul's claiming for himself what he
   elsewhere declares belongs peculiarly to the Holy Spirit, (1
   Corinthians 14:14) this must be restricted to the ministry. Now, as the
   ministry of a man is inferior to the efficacy of the Spirit, and to use
   the common expression, is subordinate to it, nothing is detracted from
   it. When he says that he prayed night and day beyond all ordinary
   measure, [561] we may gather from these words how assiduous he was in
   praying to God, and with what ardor and earnestness he discharged that
   duty.

   1 Thessalonians 3:11-13

   11. Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct
   our way unto you.

   11. Ipse autem Deus et Pater noster, et Dominus noster Iesus Christus
   viam nostram ad vos dirigat.

   12. And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward
   another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:

   12. Vos autem Dominus impleat et abundare faciat caritate mutua inter
   vos et erga omnes: quemadmodum et nos ipsi affecti sumus erga vos:

   13. To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness
   before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
   with all his saints.

   13. Ut confirmet corda vestra irreprehensibilia, in sanctitate coram
   Deo et Patre nostro, in adventu Domini nostri Iesu Christi, cum omnibus
   sanctis eius.


   11 Now God himself. He now prays that the Lord, having removed Satan's
   obstructions, may open a door for himself, and be, as it were, the
   leader and director of his way to the Thessalonians. By this he
   intimates, that we cannot move a step with success, [562] otherwise
   than under God's guidance, but that when he holds out his hand, it is
   to no purpose that Satan employs every effort to change the direction
   of our course. We must take notice that he assigns the same office to
   God and to Christ, as, unquestionably, the Father confers no blessing
   upon us except through Christ's hand. When, however, he thus speaks of
   both in the same terms, he teaches that Christ has divinity and power
   in common with the Father.

   12 And the Lord fill you. Here we have another prayer -- that in the
   mean time, while his way is obstructed, the Lord, during his absence,
   may confirm the Thessalonians in holiness, and fill them with love. And
   from this again we learn in what the perfection of the Christian life
   consists -- in love and pure holiness of heart, flowing from faith. He
   recommends love mutually cherished towards each other, and afterwards
   towards all, for as it is befitting that a commencement should be made
   with those that are of the household of faith, (Galatians 6:10) so our
   love ought to go forth to the whole human race. Farther, as the nearer
   connection must be cherished, [563] so we must not overlook those who
   are farther removed from us, so as to prevent them from holding their
   proper place.

   He would have the Thessalonians abound in love and be filled with it,
   because in so far as we make progress in acquaintance with God, the
   love of the brethren must at the same time increase in us, until it
   take possession of our whole heart, the corrupt love of self being
   extirpated. He prays that the love of the Thessalonians may be
   perfected by God, intimating that its increase, no less than its
   commencement, was from God alone. Hence it is evident how preposterous
   a part those act who measure our strength by the precepts of the Divine
   law. The end of the law is love, says Paul, (1 Timothy 1:5) yet he
   himself declares that it is a work of God. When, therefore, God marks
   out our life, [564] he does not look to what we can do, but requires
   from us what is above our strength, that we may learn to ask from him
   power to accomplish it. When he says -- as we also towards you, he
   stimulates them by his own example.

   13 That he may confirm your hearts. He employs the term hearts here to
   mean conscience, or the innermost part of the soul; for he means that a
   man is acceptable to God only when he brings holiness of heart; that
   is, not merely external, but also internal. But it is asked, whether by
   means of holiness we stand at God's judgment-seat, for if so, to what
   purpose is remission of sins? Yet Paul's words seem to imply this --
   that their consciences might be irreproveable in holiness. I answer,
   that Paul does not exclude remission of sins, through which it comes
   that our holiness, which is otherwise mixed up with many pollutions,
   bears God's eye, for faith, by which God is pacified towards us, so as
   to pardon our faults, [565] precedes everything else, as the foundation
   comes before the building. Paul, however, does not teach us what or how
   great the holiness of believers may be, but desires that it may be
   increased, until it attain its perfection. On this account he says --
   at the coming of our Lord, meaning that the completion of those things,
   which the Lord now begins in us, is delayed till that time.

   With all his saints. This clause may be explained in two ways, either
   as meaning that the Thessalonians, with all saints, may have pure
   hearts at Christ's coming, or that Christ will come with all his
   saints. While I adopt this second meaning, in so far as concerns the
   construction of the words, I have at the same time no doubt that Paul
   employed the term saints for the purpose of admonishing us that we are
   called by Christ for this end--that we may be gathered with all his
   saints. For this consideration ought to whet our desire for holiness.

   CHAPTER 4
     __________________________________________________________________

   1 Thessalonians 4:1-5

   1. Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the
   Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to
   please God, so ye would abound more and more.

   1. Ergo quod reliquum est, fratres, rogamus vos et obsecramus in Domino
   Iesu, quemadmodum accepistis a nobis, quomodo oporteat vos ambulare et
   placere Deo, ut abundetis magis:

   2. For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.

   2. Nostis enim quae praecepta dederimus vobis per Dominum Iesum.

   3. For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye
   should abstain from fornication:

   3. Haec enim est voluntas Dei, sanctificatio vestra: ut vos abstineatis
   ab omni scortatione.

   4. That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in
   sanctification and honour;

   4. Et sciat unusquisque vestrum suum vas possidere in sanctificatione
   et honore:

   5. Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know
   not God:

   5. Non in affectu concupiscentiae, quemadmodum et Gentes, quae non
   noverunt Deum.


   1 Furthermore. This chapter contains various injunctions, by which he
   trains up the Thessalonians to a holy life, or confirms them in the
   exercise of it. They had previously learned what was the rule and
   method of a pious life: he calls this to their remembrance. As, says
   he, ye have been taught. Lest, however, he should seem to take away
   from them what he had previously assigned them, he does not simply
   exhort them to walk in such a manner, but to abound more and more.
   When, therefore, he urges them to make progress, he intimates that they
   are already in the way. The sum is this, that they should be more
   especially careful to make progress in the doctrine which they had
   received, and this Paul places in contrast with frivolous and vain
   pursuits, in which we see that a good part of the world very generally
   busy themselves, so that profitable and holy meditation as to the due
   regulation of life scarcely obtains a place, even the most inferior.
   Paul, accordingly, reminds them in what manner they had been
   instructed, and bids them aim at this with their whole might. Now,
   there is a law that is here enjoined upon us -- that, forgetting the
   things that are behind, we always aim at farther progress, (Philippians
   3:13) and pastors ought also to make this their endeavor. Now, as to
   his beseeching, when he might rightfully enjoin -- it is a token of
   humanity and modesty which pastors ought to imitate, that they may, if
   possible, allure people to kindness, rather than violently compel them.
   [566]

   3 For this is the will of God. This is doctrine of a general nature,
   from which, as from a fountain, he immediately deduces special
   admonitions. When he says that this is the will of God, he means that
   we have been called by God with this design. "For this end ye are
   Christians -- this the gospel aims at -- that ye may sanctify
   yourselves to God." The meaning of the term sanctification we have
   already explained elsewhere in repeated instances -- that renouncing
   the world, and clearing ourselves from the pollutions of the flesh, we
   offer ourselves to God as if in sacrifice, for nothing can with
   propriety be offered to Him, but what is pure and holy.

   That ye abstain. This is one injunction, which he derives from the
   fountain of which he had immediately before made mention; for nothing
   is more opposed to holiness than the defilement of fornication, which
   pollutes the whole man. On this account he assigns the lust of
   concupiscence to the Gentiles, who know not God. "Where the knowledge
   of God reigns, lusts must be subdued."

   By the lust of concupiscence, he means all base lusts of the flesh,
   but, at the same time, by this manner of expression, he brands with
   dishonor all desires that allure us to pleasure and carnal delights, as
   in Romans 13:14, he bids us have no care for the flesh in respect of
   the lust thereof. For when men give indulgence to their appetites,
   there are no bounds to lasciviousness. [567] Hence the only means of
   maintaining temperance is to bridle all lusts.

   As for the expression, that every one of you may know to possess his
   vessel, some explain it as referring to a wife, [568] as though it had
   been said, "Let husbands dwell with their wives in all chastity." As,
   however, he addresses husbands and wives indiscriminately, there can be
   no doubt that he employs the term vessel to mean body. For every one
   has his body as a house, as it were, in which he dwells. He would,
   therefore, have us keep our body pure from all uncleanness.

   And honor, that is, honorably, for the man that prostitutes his body to
   fornication, covers it with infamy and disgrace.

   1 Thessalonians 4:6-8

   6. That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because
   that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned
   you and testified.

   6. Ne quis opprimat vel circumveniat in negotio fratrem suum: quia
   vindex erit Dominus omnium istorum, quemadmodum et praediximus vobis,
   et obtestati sumus.

   7. For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.

   7. Non enim vocavit vos Deus ad immunditiam, sed ad sanctificationem.

   8. He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath
   also given unto us his Holy Spirit.

   8. Itaque qui hoc repudiat, non hominem repudiat, sed Deum, qui etiam
   dedit Spiritum suum sanctum in nos.


   6 Let no man oppress. Here we have another exhortation, which flows,
   like a stream, from the doctrine of sanctification. "God," says he,
   "has it in view to sanctify us, that no man may do injury to his
   brother." For as to Chrysostom's connecting this statement with the
   preceding one, and explaining huperbainein kai pleonektein to mean --
   neighing after the wives of others, (Jeremiah 5:8) and eagerly desiring
   them, is too forced an exposition. Paul, accordingly, having adduced
   one instance of unchastity in respect of lasciviousness and lust,
   teaches that this also is a department of holiness -- that we conduct
   ourselves righteously and harmlessly towards our neighbors. The former
   verb refers to violent oppressions -- where the man that has more power
   emboldens himself to inflict injury. The latter includes in it all
   immoderate and unrighteous desires. As, however, mankind, for the most
   part, indulge themselves in lust and avarice, he reminds them of what
   he had formerly taught -- that God would be the avenger of all such
   things. We must observe, however, what he says -- we have solemnly
   testified; [569] for such is the sluggishness of mankind, that, unless
   they are wounded to the quick, they are touched with no apprehension of
   God's judgment.

   7 For God hath not called us. This appears to be the same sentiment
   with the preceding one -- that the will of God is our sanctification.
   There is, however, a little difference between them. For after having
   discoursed as to the correcting of the vices of the flesh, he proves,
   from the end of our calling, that God desires this. For he sets us
   apart to himself as his peculiar possession. [570] Again, that God
   calls us to holiness, he proves by contraries, because he rescues us,
   and calls us back, from unchastity. From this he concludes, that all
   that reject this doctrine reject not men, but God, the Author of this
   calling, which altogether falls to the ground so soon as this principle
   as to newness of life is overthrown. Now, the reason why he rouses
   himself so vehemently is, because there are always wanton persons who,
   while they fearlessly despise God, treat with ridicule all threatenings
   of his judgment, and at the same time hold in derision all injunctions
   as to a holy and pious life. Such persons must not be taught, but must
   be beaten with severe reproofs as with the stroke of a hammer.

   8 Who hath also given. That he may the more effectually turn away the
   Thessalonians from such contempt and obstinacy, he reminds them that
   they had been endowed with the Spirit of God, first, in order that they
   may distinguish what proceeds from God; secondly, that they make such a
   difference as is befitting between holiness and impurity; and thirdly,
   that, with heavenly authority, they may pronounce judgment against all
   manner of unchastity -- such as will fall upon their own heads, unless
   they keep aloof from contagion. Hence, however wicked men may treat
   with ridicule all instructions that are given as to a holy life and the
   fear of God, those that are endowed with the Spirit of God have a very
   different testimony sealed upon their hearts. We must therefore take
   heed, lest we should extinguish or obliterate it. At the same time,
   this may refer to Paul and the other teachers, as though he had said,
   that it is not from human perception that they condemn unchastity, but
   they pronounce from the authority of God what has been suggested to
   them by his Spirit. I am inclined, however, to include both. Some
   manuscripts have the second person -- you, which restricts the gift of
   the Spirit to the Thessalonians.

   1 Thessalonians 4:9-12

   9. But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you:
   for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.

   9. De fraterno autem amore non opus habetis, ut scribam vobis: ipsi
   enim vos a Deo estis edocti, ut diligatis invicem.

   10. And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all
   Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and
   more;

   10. Etenim hoc facitis erga omnes fratres, qui sunt in tota Macedonia.
   Hortamur autem vos, fratres, ut abundetis magis,

   11. And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to
   work with your own hands, as we commanded you;

   11. Et altius contendatis, ut colatis quietem, et agatis res vestras,
   et laboretis manibus vestris, quemadmodum vobis denuntiavimus,

   12. That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye
   may have lack of nothing.

   12. Ut ambuletis decenter erga extraneos, et nulla re opus habeatis.


   9 As to brotherly love. Having previously, in lofty terms, commended
   their love, he now speaks by way of anticipation, saying, ye need not
   that I write to you. He assigns a reason -- because they had been
   divinely taught -- by which he means that love was engraven upon their
   hearts, so that there was no need of letters written on paper. For he
   does not mean simply what John says in his first Canonical [571]
   Epistle, the anointing will teach you, (1 John 2:27) but that their
   hearts were framed for love; so that it appears that the Holy Spirit
   inwardly dictates efficaciously what is to be done, so that there is no
   need to give injunctions in writing. He subjoins an argument from the
   greater to the less; for as their love diffuses itself through the
   whole of Macedonia, he infers that it is not to be doubted that they
   love one another. Hence the particle for means likewise, or nay more,
   for, as I have already stated, he adds it for the sake of greater
   intensity.

   10 And we exhort you. Though he declares that they were sufficiently
   prepared of themselves for all offices of love, he nevertheless does
   not cease to exhort them to make progress, there being no perfection in
   men. And, unquestionably, whatever appears in us in a high state of
   excellence, we must still desire that it may become better. Some
   connect the verb philotimeiszai with what follows, as if he exhorted
   them to strive at the maintaining of peace; but it corresponds better
   with the expression that goes before. For after having admonished them
   to increase in love, he recommends to them a sacred emulation, that
   they may strive among themselves in mutual affection, or at least he
   enjoins that each one strive to conquer himself; [572] and I rather
   adopt this latter interpretation. That, therefore, their love may be
   perfect, he requires that there be a striving among them, such as is
   wont to be on the part of those who eagerly [573] aspire at victory.
   This is the best emulation, when each one strives to overcome himself
   in doing good. As to my not subscribing to the opinion of those who
   render the words, strive to maintain peace, this single reason appears
   to me to be sufficiently valid -- that Paul would not in a thing of
   less difficulty have enjoined so arduous a conflict -- which suits
   admirably well with advancement in love, where so many hindrances
   present themselves. Nor would I have any objection to the other meaning
   of the verb -- that they should exercise liberality generally towards
   others.

   11 Maintain Peace. I have already stated that this clause must be
   separated from what goes before, for this is a new sentence. Now, to be
   at peace, means in this passage -- to act peacefully and without
   disturbance, as we also say in French -- sans bruit, (without noise.)
   In short, he exhorts them to be peaceable and tranquil. This is the
   purport of what he adds immediately afterwards -- to do your own
   business: for we commonly see, that those who intrude themselves with
   forwardness into the affairs of others, make great disturbance, and
   give trouble to themselves and others. This, therefore, is the best
   means of a tranquil life, when every one, intent upon the duties of his
   own calling, discharges those duties which are enjoined upon him by the
   Lord, and devotes himself to these things: while the husbandman employs
   himself in rural labors, the workman carries on his occupation, and in
   this way every one keeps within his own limits. So soon as men turn
   aside from this, everything is thrown into confusion and disorder. He
   does not mean, however, that every one shall mind his own business in
   such a way as that each one should live apart, having no care for
   others, but has merely in view to correct an idle levity, which makes
   men noisy bustlers in public, who ought to lead a quiet life in their
   own houses.

   Labor with your hands. He recommends manual labor on two accounts --
   that they may have a sufficiency for maintaining life, and that they
   may conduct themselves honorably even before unbelievers. For nothing
   is more unseemly than a man that is idle and good for nothing, who
   profits neither himself nor others, and seems born only to eat and
   drink. Farther, this labor or system of working extends far, for what
   he says as to hands is by way of synecdoche; but there can be no doubt
   that he includes every useful employment of human life.

   1 Thessalonians 4:13-14

   13. But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them
   which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no
   hope.

   13. Nolo autem vos ignorare, fratres, de iis qui obdormierunt, ut ne
   contristemini, sicut et caeteri qui spem non habent.

   14. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also
   which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.

   14. Nam si credimus, quod Iesus mortuus est, et resurrexit, ita et Deus
   eos, qui dormierunt per Christum, adducet cum eo.


   13 But I would not have you ignorant. It is not likely that the hope of
   a resurrection had been torn up among the Thessalonians by profane men,
   as had taken place at Corinth. For we see how he chastises the
   Corinthians with severity, but here he speaks of it as a thing that was
   not doubtful. It is possible, however, that this persuasion was not
   sufficiently fixed in their minds, and that they accordingly, in
   bewailing the dead, retained something of the old superstition. For the
   sum of the whole is this -- that we must not bewail the dead beyond due
   bounds, inasmuch as we are all to be raised up again. For whence comes
   it, that the mourning of unbelievers has no end or measure, but because
   they have no hope of a resurrection? It becomes not us, therefore, who
   have been instructed as to a resurrection, to mourn otherwise than in
   moderation. He is to discourse afterwards as to the manner of the
   resurrection; and he is also on this account to say something as to
   times; but in this passage he meant simply to restrain excessive grief,
   which would never have had such an influence among them, if they had
   seriously considered the resurrection, and kept it in remembrance.

   He does not, however, forbid us altogether to mourn, but requires
   moderation in our mourning, for he says, that ye may not sorrow, as
   others who have no hope. He forbids them to grieve in the manner of
   unbelievers, who give loose reins to their grief, because they look
   upon death as final destruction, and imagine that everything that is
   taken out of the world perishes. As, on the other hand, believers know
   that they quit the world, that they may be at last gathered into the
   kingdom of God, they have not the like occasion of grief. Hence the
   knowledge of a resurrection is the means of moderating grief. He speaks
   of the dead as asleep, agreeably to the common practice of Scripture --
   a term by which the bitterness of death is mitigated, for there is a
   great difference between sleep and destruction [574] It refers,
   however, not to the soul, but to the body, for the dead body lies in
   the tomb, as in a couch, until God raise up the man. Those, therefore,
   act a foolish part, who infer from this that souls sleep. [575]

   We are now in possession of Paul's meaning -- that he lifts up the
   minds of believers to a consideration of the resurrection, lest they
   should indulge excessive grief on occasion of the death of their
   relatives, for it were unseemly that there should be no difference
   between them and unbelievers, who put no end or measure to their grief
   for this reason, that in death they recognize nothing but destruction.
   [576] Those that abuse this testimony, so as to establish among
   Christians Stoical indifference, that is, an iron hardness, [577] will
   find nothing of this nature in Paul's words. As to their objecting that
   we must not indulge grief on occasion of the death of our relatives,
   lest we should resist God, this would apply in all adversities; but it
   is one thing to bridle our grief, that it may be made subject to God,
   and quite another thing to harden one's self so as to be like stones,
   by casting away human feelings. Let, therefore, the grief of the pious
   be mixed with consolation, which may train them to patience. The hope
   of a blessed resurrection, which is the mother of patience, will effect
   this.

   14 For if we believe. He assumes this axiom of our faith, that Christ
   was raised up from the dead, that we might be partakers of the same
   resurrection: from this he infers, that we shall live with him
   eternally. This doctrine, however, as has been stated in 1 Corinthians
   15:13, depends on another principle -- that it was not for himself, but
   for us that Christ died and rose again. Hence those who have doubts as
   to the resurrection, do great injury to Christ: nay more, they do in a
   manner draw him down from heaven, as is said in Romans 10:6

   To sleep in Christ, is to retain in death the connection that we have
   with Christ, for those that are by faith ingrafted into Christ, have
   death in common with him, that they may be partakers with him of life.
   It is asked, however, whether unbelievers will not also rise again, for
   Paul does not affirm that there will be a resurrection, except in the
   case of Christ's members. I answer, that Paul does not here touch upon
   anything but what suited his present design. For he did not design to
   terrify the wicked, but to correct [578] the immoderate grief of the
   pious, and to cure it, as he does, by the medicine of consolation.

   1 Thessalonians 4:15-18

   15. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are
   alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them
   which are asleep.

   15. Hoc enim vobis dicimus in sermone Domini, quod nos, qui vivemus et
   superstites erimus in adventum Domini, non praeveniemus eos, qui
   dormierunt.

   16. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with
   the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in
   Christ shall rise first:

   16. Quoniam ipse Dominus cum clamore, cum voce Archangeli et tuba Dei
   descendet e coelo: ac mortui, qui in Christo sunt, resurgent primum.

   17. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with
   them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever
   be with the Lord.

   17. Deinde nos qui vivemus, ac residui erimus, simul cum ipsis rapiemur
   in nubibus, in occursum Domini in aera: et sic semper cum Domino
   erimus.

   18. Wherefore comfort one another with these words.

   18. Itaque consolamini vos mutuo in sermonibus istis.


   15 For this we say unto you. He now briefly explains the manner in
   which believers will be raised up from death. Now, as he speaks of a
   thing that is very great, and is incredible to the human mind, and also
   promises what is above the power and choice of men, he premises that he
   does not bring forward anything that is his own, or that proceeds from
   men, but that the Lord is the Author of it. It is probable, however,
   that the word of the Lord means what was taken from his discourses.
   [579] For though Paul had learned by revelation all the secrets of the
   heavenly kingdom, it was, nevertheless, more fitted to establish in the
   minds of believers the belief of a resurrection, when he related those
   things that had been uttered by Christ's own mouth. "We are not the
   first witnesses of the resurrection, but instead of this the Master
   himself declared it." [580]

   We who live. This has been said by him with this view -- that they
   might not think that those only would be partakers of the resurrection
   who would be alive at the time of Christ's coming, and that those would
   have no part in it who had been previously taken away by death. "The
   order of the resurrection," says he, "will begin with them: [581] we
   shall accordingly not rise without them." From this it appears that the
   belief of a final resurrection had been, in the minds of some, slight
   and obscure, and involved in various errors, inasmuch as they imagined
   that the dead would be deprived of it; for they imagined that eternal
   life belonged to those alone whom Christ, at his last coming, would
   find still alive upon the earth. Paul, with the view of remedying these
   errors, assigns the first place to the dead, and afterwards teaches
   that those will follow who will be at that time remaining in this life.

   As to the circumstance, however, that by speaking in the first person
   he makes himself, as it were, one of the number of those who will live
   until the last day, he means by this to arouse the Thessalonians to
   wait for it, nay more, to hold all believers in suspense, that they may
   not promise themselves some particular time: for, granting that it was
   by a special revelation that he knew that Christ would come at a
   somewhat later time, [582] it was nevertheless necessary that this
   doctrine should be delivered to the Church in common, that believers
   might be prepared at all times. In the mean time, it was necessary thus
   to cut off all pretext for the curiosity of many -- as we shall find
   him doing afterwards at greater length. When, however, he says, we that
   are alive, he makes use of the present tense instead of the future, in
   accordance with the Hebrew idiom.

   16 For the Lord himself. He employs the term keleusmatos, (shout,) and
   afterwards adds, the voice of the archangel, by way of exposition,
   intimating what is to be the nature of that arousing shout -- that the
   archangel will discharge the office of a herald to summon the living
   and the dead to the tribunal of Christ. For though this will be common
   to all the angels, yet, as is customary among different ranks, he
   appoints one in the foremost place to take the lead of the others. As
   to the trumpet, however, I leave to others to dispute with greater
   subtlety, for I have nothing to say in addition to what I briefly
   noticed in the First Epistle to the Corinthians. [583] The Apostle
   unquestionably had nothing farther in view here than to give some taste
   of the magnificence and venerable appearance of the Judge, until we
   shall behold it fully. With this taste it becomes us in the mean time
   to rest satisfied.

   The dead who are in Christ. He again says that the dead who are in
   Christ, that is, who are included in Christ's body, will rise first,
   that we may know that the hope of life is laid up in heaven for them no
   less than for the living. He says nothing as to the reprobate, because
   this did not tend to the consolation of the pious, of which he is now
   treating.

   He says that those that survive will be carried up together with them.
   As to these, he makes no mention of death: hence it appears as if he
   meant to say that they would be exempted from death. Here Augustine
   gives himself much distress, both in the twentieth book on the City of
   God and in his Answer to Dulcitius, because Paul seems to contradict
   himself, inasmuch as he says elsewhere, that seed cannot spring up
   again unless it die. (1 Corinthians 15:36) The solution, however, is
   easy, inasmuch as a sudden change will be like death. Ordinary death,
   it is true, is the separation of the soul from the body; but this does
   not hinder that the Lord may in a moment destroy this corruptible
   nature, so as to create it anew by his power, for thus is accomplished
   what Paul himself teaches must take place -- that mortality shall be
   swallowed up of life. (2 Corinthians 5:4) What is stated in our
   Confession, [584] that "Christ will be the Judge of the dead and of the
   living," [585] Augustine acknowledges to be true without a figure.
   [586] He is only at a loss as to this -- how those that have not died
   will rise again. But, as I have said, that is a kind of death, when
   this flesh is reduced to nothing, as it is now liable to corruption.
   The only difference is this -- that those who sleep [587] put off the
   substance of the body for some space of time, but those that will be
   suddenly changed will put off nothing but the quality

   17 And so we shall be ever. To those who have been once gathered to
   Christ he promises eternal life with him, by which statements the
   reveries of Origen and of the Chiliasts [588] are abundantly refuted.
   For the life of believers, when they have once been gathered into one
   kingdom, will have no end any more than Christ's. Now, to assign to
   Christ a thousand years, so that he would afterwards cease to reign,
   were too horrible to be made mention of. Those, however, fall into this
   absurdity who limit the life of believers to a thousand years, for they
   must live with Christ as long as Christ himself will exist. We must
   observe also what he says -- we shall be, for he means that we
   profitably entertain a hope of eternal life, only when we hope that it
   has been expressly appointed for us.

   18 Comfort. He now shews more openly what I have previously stated --
   that in the faith of the resurrection we have good ground of
   consolation, provided we are members of Christ, and are truly united to
   him as our Head. At the same time, the Apostle would not have each one
   to seek for himself assuagement of grief, but also to administer it to
   others.

   1 Thessalonians 5:1-5

   1. But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I
   write unto you.

   1. Porro de temporibus et articulis temporum non opus habetis, ut vobis
   scribatur.

   2. For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as
   a thief in the night.

   2. Ipsi enim optime scitis, quod dies Domini tanquam fur in nocte sic
   veniet.

   3. For when they shall say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction
   cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall
   not escape.

   3. Quando enim dixerint, Pax et securitas, tunc repentinus ipsis
   superveniet interitus, quasi dolor partus mulieri praegnanti, nec
   effugient.

   4. But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake
   you as a thief.

   4. Vos autem, fratres, non estis in tenebris, ut dies ille vos quasi
   fur opprimat.

   5. Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we
   are not of the night, nor of darkness.

   5. Omnes vos filii lucis estis, et filii diei: non sumus noctis, neque
   tenebrarum.


   1 But as to times. He now, in the third place, calls them back from a
   curious and unprofitable inquiry as to times, but in the mean time
   admonishes them to be constantly in a state of preparation for
   receiving Christ. [589] He speaks, however, by way of anticipation,
   saying, that they have no need that he should write as to those things
   which the curious desire to know. For it is an evidence of excessive
   incredulity not to believe what the Lord foretells, unless he marks out
   the day by certain circumstances, and as it were points it out with the
   finger. As, therefore, those waver between doubtful opinions who
   require that moments of time should be marked out for them, as if they
   would draw a conjecture [590] from some plausible demonstration, he
   accordingly says that discussions of this nature are not necessary for
   the pious. There is also another reason -- that believers do not desire
   to know more than they are permitted to learn in God's school. Now
   Christ designed that the day of his coming should be hid from us, that,
   being in suspense, we might be as it were upon watch.

   2 Ye know perfectly. He places exact knowledge in contrast with an
   anxious desire of investigation. But what is it that he says the
   Thessalonians know accurately? [591] It is, that the day of Christ will
   come suddenly and unexpectedly, so as to take unbelievers by surprise,
   as a thief does those that are asleep. This, however, is opposed to
   evident tokens, which might portend afar off his coming to the world.
   Hence it were foolish to wish to determine the time precisely from
   presages or prodigies.

   3 For when they shall say. Here we have an explanation of the
   similitude, the day of the Lord will be like a thief in the night. Why
   so? because it will come suddenly to unbelievers, when not looked for,
   so that it will take them by surprise, as though they were asleep. But
   whence comes that sleep? Assuredly from deep contempt of God. The
   prophets frequently reprove the wicked on account of this supine
   negligence, and assuredly they await in a spirit of carelessness not
   merely that last judgment, but also such as are of daily occurrence.
   Though the Lord threatens destruction, [592] they do not hesitate to
   promise themselves peace and every kind of prosperity. And the reason
   why they fall into this destructive indolence [593] is, because they do
   not see those things immediately accomplished, which the Lord declares
   will take place, for they reckon that to be fabulous that does not
   immediately present itself before their eyes. For this reason the Lord,
   in order that he may avenge this carelessness, which is full of
   obstinacy, comes all on a sudden, and contrary to the expectation of
   all, precipitates the wicked from the summit of felicity. He sometimes
   furnishes tokens of this nature of a sudden advent, but that will be
   the principal one, when Christ will come down to judge the world, as he
   himself testifies, (Matthew 24:37) comparing that time to the age of
   Noe, inasmuch as all will give way to excess, as if in the profoundest
   repose.

   As the pains of child-bearing. Here we have a most apt similitude,
   inasmuch as there is no evil that seizes more suddenly, and that
   presses more keenly and more violently on the very first attack;
   besides this, a woman that is with child carries in her womb occasion
   of grief without feeling it, until she is seized amidst feasting and
   laughter, or in the midst of sleep.

   4 But ye, brethren. He now admonishes them as to what is the duty of
   believers, that they look forward in hope to that day, though it be
   remote. And this is what is intended in the metaphor of day and light.
   The coming of Christ will take by surprise those that are carelessly
   giving way to indulgence, because, being enveloped in darkness, they
   see nothing, for no darkness is more dense than ignorance of God. We,
   on the other hand, on whom Christ has shone by the faith of his gospel,
   differ much from them, for that saying of Isaiah is truly accomplished
   in us, that

   while darkness covers the earth, the Lord arises upon us, and his glory
   is seen in us. (Isaiah 60:2)

   He admonishes us, therefore, that it were an unseemly thing that we
   should be caught by Christ asleep, as it were, or seeing nothing, while
   the full blaze of light is shining forth upon us. He calls them
   children of light, in accordance with the Hebrew idiom, as meaning --
   furnished with light; as also children of the day, meaning -- those who
   enjoy the light of day. [594] And this he again confirms, when he says
   that we are not of the night nor of darkness, because the Lord has
   rescued us from it. For it is as though he had said, that we have not
   been enlightened by the Lord with a view to our walking in darkness.

   cum ipso vivamus.


   6 Therefore let us not sleep. He adds other metaphors closely allied to
   the preceding one. For as he lately shewed that it were by no means
   seemly that they should be blind in the midst of light, so he now
   admonishes that it were dishonorable and disgraceful to sleep or be
   drunk in the middle of the day. Now, as he gives the name of day to the
   doctrine of the gospel, by which the Christ, the Sun of righteousness
   (Malachi 4:2) is manifested to us, so when he speaks of sleep and
   drunkenness, he does not mean natural sleep, or drunkenness from wine,
   but stupor of mind, when, forgetting God and ourselves, we regardlessly
   indulge our vices. Let us not sleep, says he; that is, let us not, sunk
   in indolence, become senseless in the world. As others, that is,
   unbelievers, [595] from whom ignorance of God, like a dark night, takes
   away understanding and reason. But let us watch, that is, let us look
   to the Lord with an attentive mind. And be sober, that is, casting away
   the cares of the world, which weigh us down by their pressure, and
   throwing off base lusts, mount to heaven with freedom and alacrity. For
   this is spiritual sobriety, when we use this world so sparingly and
   temperately that we are not entangled with its allurements.

   8 Having put on the breastplate. He adds this, that he may the more
   effectually shake us out of our stupidity, for he calls us as it were
   to arms, that he may shew that it is not a time to sleep. It is true
   that he does not make use of the term war; but when he arms us with a
   breastplate and a helmet, he admonishes us that we must maintain a
   warfare. Whoever, therefore, is afraid of being surprised by the enemy,
   must keep awake, that he may be constantly on watch. As, therefore, he
   has exhorted to vigilance, on the ground that the doctrine of the
   gospel is like the light of day, so he now stirs us up by another
   argument -- that we must wage war with our enemy. From this it follows,
   that idleness is too hazardous a thing. For we see that soldiers,
   though in other situations they may be intemperate, do nevertheless,
   when the enemy is near, from fear of destruction, refrain from gluttony
   [596] and all bodily delights, and are diligently on watch so as to be
   upon their guard. As, therefore, Satan is on the alert against us, and
   tries a thousand schemes, we ought at least to be not less diligent and
   watchful. [597]

   It is, however, in vain, that some seek a more refined exposition of
   the names of the kinds of armor, for Paul speaks here in a different
   way from what he does in Ephesians 6:14 for there he makes
   righteousness the breastplate. This, therefore, will suffice for
   understanding his meaning, that he designs to teach, that the life of
   Christians is like a perpetual warfare, inasmuch as Satan does not
   cease to trouble and molest them. He would have us, therefore, be
   diligently prepared and on the alert for resistance: farther, he
   admonishes us that we have need of arms, because unless we be well
   armed we cannot withstand so powerful [598] an enemy. He does not,
   however, enumerate all the parts of armor, (panoplian,) but simply
   makes mention of two, the breastplate and the helmet. In the mean time,
   he omits nothing of what belongs to spiritual armor, for the man that
   is provided with faith, love, and hope, will be found in no department
   unarmed.

   9 For God hath not appointed us. As he has spoken of the hope of
   salvation, he follows out that department, and says that God has
   appointed us to this -- that we may obtain salvation through Christ.
   The passage, however, might be explained in a simple way in this manner
   -- that we must put on the helmet of salvation, because God wills not
   that we should perish, but rather that we should be saved. And this,
   indeed, Paul means, but, in my opinion, he has in view something
   farther. For as the day of Christ is for the most part regarded with
   alarm, [599] having it in view to close with the mention of it, he says
   that we are appointed to salvation

   The Greek term peripoiesis means enjoyment, (as they speak,) as well as
   acquisition. Paul, undoubtedly, does not mean that God has called us,
   that we may procure salvation for ourselves, but that we may obtain it,
   as it has been acquired for us by Christ. Paul, however, encourages
   believers to fight strenuously, setting before them the certainty of
   victory; for the man who fights timidly and hesitatingly is
   half-conquered. In these words, therefore, he had it in view to take
   away the dread which arises from distrust. There cannot, however, be a
   better assurance of salvation gathered, than from the decree [600] of
   God. The term wrath, in this passage, as in other instances, is taken
   to mean the judgment or vengeance of God against the reprobate.

   10 Who died. From the design of Christ's death he confirms what he has
   said, for if he died with this view -- that he might make us partakers
   of his life, there is no reason why we should be in doubt as to our
   salvation. It is doubtful, however, what he means now by sleeping and
   waking, for it might seem as if he meant life and death, and this
   meaning would be more complete. At the same time, we might not
   unsuitably interpret it as meaning ordinary sleep. The sum is this --
   that Christ died with this view, that he might bestow upon us his life,
   which is perpetual and has no end. It is not to be wondered, however,
   that he affirms that we now live with Christ, inasmuch as we have, by
   entering through faith into the kingdom of Christ, passed from death
   into life. (John 5:24) Christ himself, into whose body we are
   ingrafted, quickens us by his power, and the Spirit that dwelleth in us
   is life, because of justification [601]

   1 Thessalonians 5:11--14

   11. Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even
   as also ye do.

   11. Quare exhortamini (vel, consolamini) vos invicem, et aedificate
   singuli singulos, sicut et facitis.

   12. And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you,
   and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;

   12. Rogamus autem vos, fratres, ut agnoscatis eos, qui laborant in
   vobis, et praesunt vobis in Domino, et admonent vos:

   13. And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And
   be at peace among yourselves.

   13. Ut eos habeatis in summo pretio cum caritate propter opus ipsorum:
   pacem habete cum ipsis, (vel, inter vos.)

   14. Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the
   feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men

   14. Hortamur autem vos, fratres, monete inordinatos, consolamini
   pusillanimos, suscipite infirmos, patientes estote erga omnes.


   11 Exhort. It is the same word that we had in the close of the
   preceding chapter, and which we rendered comfort, because the context
   required it, and the same would not suit ill with this passage also.
   For what he has treated of previously furnishes matter of both -- of
   consolation as well as of exhortation. He bids them, therefore,
   communicate to one another what has been given them by the Lord. He
   adds, that they may edify one another -- that is, may confirm each
   other in that doctrine. Lest, however, it might seem as if he reproved
   them for carelessness, he says at the same time that they of their own
   accord did what he enjoins. But, as we are slow to what is good, those
   that are the most favourably inclined of all, have always,
   nevertheless, need to be stimulated.

   12 And we beseech you. Here we have an admonition that is very
   necessary. For as the kingdom of God is lightly esteemed, or at least
   is not esteemed suitably to its dignity, there follows also from this,
   contempt of pious teachers. Now, the most of them, offended with this
   ingratitude, not so much because they see themselves despised, as
   because they infer from this, that honor is not rendered to their Lord,
   are rendered thereby more indifferent, and God also, on just grounds,
   inflicts vengeance upon the world, inasmuch as he deprives it of good
   ministers, [602] to whom it is ungrateful. Hence, it is not so much for
   the advantage of ministers as of the whole Church, that those who
   faithfully preside over it should be held in esteem. And it is for this
   reason that Paul is so careful to recommend them. To acknowledge means
   here to have regard or respect; but Paul intimates that the reason why
   less honor is shewn to teachers themselves than is befitting, is
   because their labor is not ordinarily taken into consideration.

   We must observe, however, with what titles of distinction he honors
   pastors. In the first place, he says that they labor. From this it
   follows, that all idle bellies are excluded from the number of pastors.
   Farther, he expresses the kind of labor when he adds, those that
   admonish, or instruct, you. It is to no purpose, therefore, that any,
   that do not discharge the office of an instructor, glory in the name of
   pastors. The Pope, it is true, readily admits such persons into his
   catalogue, but the Spirit of God expunges them from his. As, however,
   they are held in contempt in the world, as has been said, he honors
   them at the same time, with the distinction of presidency.

   Paul would have such as devote themselves to teaching, and preside with
   no other end in view than that of serving the Church, be held in no
   ordinary esteem. For he says literally -- let them be more than
   abundantly honored, and not without good ground, for we must observe
   the reason that he adds immediately afterwards -- on account of their
   work. Now, this work is the edification of the Church, the everlasting
   salvation of souls, the restoration of the world, and, in fine, the
   kingdom of God and Christ. The excellence and dignity of this work are
   inestimable: hence those whom God makes ministers in connection with so
   great a matter, ought to be held by us in great esteem. We may,
   however, infer from Paul's words, that judgment is committed to the
   Church, that it may distinguish true pastors. [603] For to no purpose
   were these marks pointed out, if he did not mean that they should be
   taken notice of by believers. And while he commands that honor be given
   to those that labor, and to those that by teaching [604] govern
   properly and faithfully, he assuredly does not bestow any honor upon
   those that are idle and wicked, nor does he mark them out as deserving
   of it.

   Preside in the Lord. This seems to be added to denote spiritual
   government. For although kings and magistrates also preside by the
   appointment of God, yet as the Lord would have the government of the
   Church to be specially recognized as his, those that govern the Church
   in the name and by the commandment of Christ, are for this reason
   spoken of particularly as presiding in the Lord. We may, however, infer
   from this, how very remote those are from the rank of pastors and
   prelates who exercise a tyranny altogether opposed to Christ.
   Unquestionably, in order that any one may be ranked among lawful
   pastors, it is necessary that he should shew that he presides in the
   Lord, and has nothing apart from him. And what else is this, but that
   by pure doctrine he puts Christ in his own seat, that he may be the
   only Lord and Master?

   13 With love. Others render it by love; for Paul says in love, which,
   according to the Hebrew idiom, is equivalent to by or with. I prefer,
   however, to explain it thus -- as meaning that he exhorts them not
   merely to respect them, [605] but also love them. For as the doctrine
   of the gospel is lovely, so it is befitting that the ministers of it
   should be loved. It were, however, rather stiff to speak of having in
   esteem by love, while the connecting together of love with honor suits
   well.

   Be at peace. While this passage has various readings, even among the
   Greeks, I approve rather of the rendering which has been given by the
   old translator, and is followed by Erasmus -- Pacem habete cum eis, vel
   colite -- (Have or cultivate peace with them.) [606] For Paul, in my
   opinion, had in view to oppose the artifices of Satan, who ceases not
   to use every endeavor to stir up either quarrels, or disagreements, or
   enmities, between people and pastor. Hence we see daily how pastors are
   hated by their Churches for some trivial reason, or for no reason
   whatever, because this desire for the cultivation of peace, which Paul
   recommends so strongly, is not exercised as it ought.

   14 Admonish the unruly. It is a common doctrine -- that the welfare of
   our brethren should be the object of our concern. This is done by
   teaching, admonishing, correcting, and arousing; but, as the
   dispositions of men are various, it is not without good reason that the
   Apostle commands that believers accommodate themselves to this variety.
   He commands, therefore, that the unruly [607] be admonished, that is,
   those who live dissolutely. The term admonition, also, is employed to
   mean sharp reproof, such as may bring them back into the right way, for
   they are deserving of greater severity, and they cannot be brought to
   repentance by any other remedy.

   Towards the faint-hearted another system of conduct must be pursued,
   for they have need of consolation. The weak must also be assisted. By
   faint-hearted, however, he means those that are of a broken and
   afflicted spirit. He accordingly favors them, and the weak, in such a
   way as to desire that the unruly should be restrained with some degree
   of sternness. On the other hand, he commands that the unruly should be
   admonished sharply, in order that the weak may be treated with kindness
   and humanity, and that the faint-hearted may receive consolation. It is
   therefore to no purpose that those that are obstinate and intractable
   demand that they be soothingly caressed, inasmuch as remedies must be
   adapted to diseases.

   He recommends, however, patience towards all, for severity must be
   tempered with some degree of lenity, even in dealing with the unruly.
   This patience, however, is, properly speaking, contrasted with a
   feeling of irksomeness, [608] for nothing are we more prone to than to
   feel wearied out when we set ourselves to cure the diseases of our
   brethren. The man who has once and again comforted a person who is
   faint-hearted, if he is called to do the same thing a third time, will
   feel I know not what vexation, nay, even indignation, that will not
   permit him to persevere in discharging his duty. Thus, if by
   admonishing or reproving, we do not immediately do the good that is to
   be desired, we lose all hope of future success. Paul had in view to
   bridle impatience of this nature, by recommending to us moderation
   towards all.

   15. See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow
   that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men

   17. Indesinenter orate.

   21. Omnia probate, quod bonum est tenete.

   22 Abstain from all appearance of evil.

   22. Ab omni specie mala abstinete.


   15 See that no one render evil for evil. As it is difficult to observe
   this precept, in consequence of the strong bent of our nature to
   revenge, he on this account bids us take care to be on our guard. For
   the word see denotes anxious care. Now, although he simply forbids us
   to strive with each other in the way of inflicting injuries, there can,
   nevertheless, be no doubt that he meant to condemn, at the same time,
   every disposition to do injury. For if it is unlawful to render evil
   for evil, every disposition to injure is culpable. This doctrine is
   peculiar to Christians -- not to retaliate injuries, but to endure them
   patiently. And lest the Thessalonians should think that revenge was
   prohibited only towards their brethren, he expressly declares that they
   are to do evil to no one. For particular excuses are wont to be brought
   forward in some cases. "What! why should it be unlawful for me to
   avenge myself on one that is so worthless, so wicked, and so cruel?"
   But as vengeance is forbidden us in every case, without exception,
   however wicked the man that has injured us may be, we must refrain from
   inflicting injury.

   But always follow benignity. By this last clause he teaches that we
   must not merely refrain from inflicting vengeance, when any one has
   injured us, but must cultivate beneficence towards all. For although he
   means that it should in the first instance be exercised among believers
   mutually, he afterwards extends it to all, however undeserving of it,
   that we may make it our aim to overcome evil with good, as he himself
   teaches elsewhere. (Romans 12:21) The first step, therefore, in the
   exercise of patience, is, not to revenge injuries; the second is, to
   bestow favors even upon enemies.

   16 Rejoice always. I refer this to moderation of spirit, when the mind
   keeps itself in calmness under adversity, and does not give indulgence
   to grief. I accordingly connect together these three things -- to
   rejoice always, to pray without ceasing, and to give thanks to God in
   all things. For when he recommends constant praying, he points out the
   way of rejoicing perpetually, for by this means we ask from God
   alleviation in connection with all our distresses. In like manner, in
   Philippians 4:4, having said,

   Rejoice in the Lord always; again I say, Rejoice. Let your moderation
   be known to all. Be not anxious as to anything. The Lord is at hand.

   He afterwards points out the means of this--

   but in every prayer let your requests be made known to God, with giving
   of thanks.

   In that passage, as we see, he presents as a source of joy a calm and
   composed mind, that is not unduly disturbed by injuries or adversities.
   But lest we should be borne down by grief, sorrow, anxiety, and fear,
   he bids us repose in the providence of God. And as doubts frequently
   obtrude themselves as to whether God cares for us, he also prescribes
   the remedy -- that by prayer we disburden our anxieties, as it were,
   into his bosom, as David commands us to do in Psalm 37:5 and Psalm
   55:22; and Peter also, after his example. (1 Peter 5:7.) As, however,
   we are unduly precipitate in our desires, he imposes a check upon them
   -- that, while we desire what we are in need of, we at the same time do
   not cease to give thanks.

   He observes, here, almost the same order, though in fewer words. For,
   in the first place, he would have us hold God's benefits in such
   esteem, that the recognition of them and meditation upon them shall
   overcome all sorrow. And, unquestionably, if we consider what Christ
   has conferred upon us, there will be no bitterness of grief so intense
   as may not be alleviated, and give way to spiritual joy. For if this
   joy does not reign in us, the kingdom of God is at the same time
   banished from us, or we from it. [609] And very ungrateful is that man
   to God, who does not set so high a value on the righteousness of Christ
   and the hope of eternal life, as to rejoice in the midst of sorrow. As,
   however, our minds are easily dispirited, until they give way to
   impatience, we must observe the remedy that he subjoins immediately
   afterwards. For on being cast down and laid low we are raised up again
   by prayers, because we lay upon God what burdened us. As, however,
   there are every day, nay, every moment, many things that may disturb
   our peace, and mar our joy, he for this reason bids us pray without
   ceasing. Now, as to this constancy in prayer, we have spoken of
   elsewhere. [610] Thanksgiving, as I have said, is added as a
   limitation. For many pray in such a manner, as at the same time to
   murmur against God, and fret themselves if he does not immediately
   gratify their wishes. But, on the contrary, it is befitting that our
   desires should be restrained in such a manner that, contented with what
   is given us, we always mingle thanksgiving with our desires. We may
   lawfully, it is true, ask, nay, sigh and lament, but it must be in such
   a way that the will of God is more acceptable to us than our own.

   18 For this is the will of God -- that is, according to Chrysostom's
   opinion -- that we give thanks. As for myself, I am of opinion that a
   more ample meaning is included under these terms -- that God has such a
   disposition towards us in Christ, that even in our afflictions we have
   large occasion of thanksgiving. For what is fitter or more suitable for
   pacifying us, than when we learn that God embraces us in Christ so
   tenderly, that he turns to our advantage and welfare everything that
   befalls us? Let us, therefore, bear in mind, that this is a special
   remedy for correcting our impatience -- to turn away our eyes from
   beholding present evils that torment us, and to direct our views to a
   consideration of a different nature -- how God stands affected towards
   us in Christ.

   19 Quench not the Spirit. This metaphor is derived from the power and
   nature of the Spirit; for as it is the proper office of the Spirit to
   illuminate the understandings of men, and as he is on this account
   called our light, it is with propriety that we are said to quench him,
   when we make void his grace. There are some that think that it is the
   same thing that is said in this clause and the succeeding one. Hence,
   according to them, to quench the Spirit is precisely the same as to
   despise prophesyings. As, however, the Spirit is quenched in various
   ways, I make a distinction between these two things--that of a general
   statement, and a particular. For although contempt of prophesying is a
   quenching of the Spirit, yet those also quench the Spirit who, instead
   of stirring up, as they ought, more and more, by daily progress, the
   sparks that God has kindled in them, do, by their negligence, make void
   the gifts of God. This admonition, therefore, as to not quenching the
   Spirit, has a wider extent of meaning than the one that follows as to
   not despising prophesyings. The meaning of the former is: "Be
   enlightened by the Spirit of God. See that you do not lose that light
   through your ingratitude." This is an exceedingly useful admonition,
   for we see that those who have been once enlightened, (Hebrews 6:4)
   when they reject so precious a gift of God, or, shutting their eves,
   allow themselves to be hurried away after the vanity of the world, are
   struck with a dreadful blindness, so as to be an example to others. We
   must, therefore, be on our guard against indolence, by which the light
   of God is choked in us.

   Those, however, who infer from this that it is in man's option either
   to quench or to cherish the light that is presented to him, so that
   they detract from the efficacy of grace, and extol the powers of free
   will, reason on false grounds. For although God works efficaciously in
   his elect, and does not merely present the light to them, but causes
   them to see, opens the eyes of their heart, and keeps them open, yet as
   the flesh is always inclined to indolence, it has need of being stirred
   up by exhortations. But what God commands by Paul's mouth, He himself
   accomplishes inwardly. In the mean time, it is our part to ask from the
   Lord, that he would furnish oil to the lamps which he has lighted up,
   that he may keep the wick pure, and may even increase it.

   20 Despise not prophesyings. This sentence is appropriately added to
   the preceding one, for as the Spirit of God illuminates us chiefly by
   doctrine, those who give not teaching its proper place, do, so far as
   in them lies, quench the Spirit, for we must always consider in what
   manner or by what means God designs to communicate himself to us. Let
   every one, therefore, who is desirous to make progress under the
   direction of the Holy Spirit, allow himself to be taught by the
   ministry of prophets.

   By the term prophecy, however, I do not understand the gift of
   foretelling the future, but as in 1 Corinthians 14:3, the science of
   interpreting Scripture, [611] so that a prophet is an interpreter of
   the will of God. For Paul, in the passage which I have quoted, assigns
   to prophets teaching for edification, exhortation, and consolation, and
   enumerates, as it were, these departments. Let, therefore, prophecy in
   this passage be understood as meaning -- interpretation made suitable
   to present use. [612] Paul prohibits us from despising it, if we would
   not choose of our own accord to wander in darkness.

   The statement, however, is a remarkable one, for the commendation of
   external preaching. It is the dream of fanatics, that those are
   children who continue to employ themselves in the reading of the
   Scripture, or the hearing of the word, as if no one were spiritual,
   unless he is a despiser of doctrine. They proudly, therefore, despise
   the ministry of man, nay, even Scripture itself, that they may attain
   the Spirit. Farther, whatever delusions Satan suggests to them, [613]
   they presumptuously set forth as secret revelations of the Spirit. Such
   are the Libertines, [614] and other furies of that stamp. And the more
   ignorant that any one is, he is puffed up and swollen out with so much
   the greater arrogance. Let us, however, learn from the example of Paul,
   to conjoin the Spirit with the voice of men, which is nothing else than
   his organ. [615]

   21 Prove all things. As rash men and deceiving spirits frequently pass
   off their trifles under the name of prophecy, prophecy might by this
   means be rendered suspicious or even odious, just as many in the
   present day feel almost disgusted with the very name of preaching, as
   there are so many foolish and ignorant persons that from the pulpit
   blab out their worthless contrivances, [616] while there are others,
   also, that are wicked and sacrilegious persons, who babble forth
   execrable blasphemies. [617] As, therefore, through the fault of such
   persons it might be, that prophecy was regarded with disdain, nay more,
   was scarcely allowed to hold a place, Paul exhorts the Thessalonians to
   prove all things, meaning, that although all do not speak precisely
   according to set rule, we must, nevertheless, form a judgment, before
   any doctrine is condemned or rejected.

   As to this, there is a twofold error that is wont to be fallen into,
   for there are some who, from having either been deceived by a false
   pretext of the name of God, or from their knowing that many are
   commonly deceived in this way, reject every kind of doctrine
   indiscriminately, while there are others that by a foolish credulity
   embrace, without distinction, everything that is presented to them in
   the name of God. Both of these ways are faulty, for the former class,
   saturated with a presumptuous prejudice of that nature, close up the
   way against their making progress, while the other class rashly expose
   themselves to all winds of errors. (Ephesians 4:14.) Paul admonishes
   the Thessalonians to keep the middle path between these two extremes,
   while he prohibits them from condemning anything without first
   examining it; and, on the other hand, he admonishes them to exercise
   judgment, before receiving, what may be brought forward, as undoubted
   truth. And unquestionably, this respect, at least, ought to be shewn to
   the name of God -- that we do not despise prophecy, which is declared
   to have proceeded from him. As, however, examination or discrimination
   ought to precede rejection, so it must, also, precede the reception of
   true and sound doctrine. For it does not become the pious to shew such
   lightness, as indiscriminately to lay hold of what is false equally
   with what is true. From this we infer, that they have the spirit of
   judgment conferred upon them by God, that they may discriminate, so as
   not to be imposed upon by the impostures of men. For if they were not
   endowed with discrimination, it were in vain that Paul said -- Prove:
   hold fast that which is good. If, however, we feel that we are left
   destitute of the power of proving aright; it must be sought by us from
   the same Spirit, who speaks by his prophets. But the Lord declares in
   this place by the mouth of Paul, that the course of doctrine ought not,
   by any faults of mankind, or by any rashness, or ignorance, or, in
   fine, by any abuse, to be hindered from being always in a vigorous
   state in the Church. For as the abolition of prophecy is the ruin of
   the Church, let us allow heaven and earth to be commingled, rather than
   that prophecy should cease.

   Paul, however, may seem here to give too great liberty in teaching,
   when he would have all things proved; for things must be heard by us,
   that they may be proved, and by this means a door would be opened to
   impostors for disseminating their falsehoods. I answer, that in this
   instance he does not by any means require that an audience should be
   given to false teachers, whose mouth he elsewhere teaches (Titus 1:11)
   must be stopped, and whom he so rigidly shuts out, and does not by any
   means set aside the arrangement, which he elsewhere recommends so
   highly (1 Timothy 3:2) in the election of teachers. As, however, so
   great diligence can never be exercised as that there should not
   sometimes be persons prophesying, who are not so well instructed as
   they ought to be, and that sometimes good and pious teachers fail to
   hit the mark, he requires such moderation on the part of believers, as,
   nevertheless, not to refuse to hear. For nothing is more dangerous,
   than that moroseness, by which every kind of doctrine is rendered
   disgusting to us, while we do not allow ourselves to prove what is
   right. [618]

   22 From every evil appearance. Some think that this is a universal
   statement, as though he commanded to abstain from all things that bear
   upon their front an appearance of evil. In that case the meaning would
   be, that it is not enough to have an internal testimony of conscience,
   unless regard be at the same time had to brethren, so as to provide
   against occasions of offense, by avoiding every thing that can have the
   appearance of evil.

   Those who explain the word speciem after the manner of dialecticians as
   meaning the subdivision of a general term, fall into an exceedingly
   gross blunder. For he [619] has employed the term speciem as meaning
   what we commonly term appearance. It may also be rendered either--evil
   appearance, or appearance of evil. The meaning, however, is the same. I
   rather prefer Chrysostom and Ambrose, who connect this sentence with
   the foregoing one. At the same time, neither of them explains Paul's
   meaning, and perhaps have not altogether hit upon what he intends. I
   shall state briefly my view of it.

   In the first place, the phrase appearance of evil, or evil appearance,
   I understand to mean -- when falsity of doctrine has not yet been
   discovered in such a manner, that it can on good grounds be rejected;
   but at the same time an unhappy suspicion is left upon the mind, and
   fears are entertained, lest there should be some poison lurking. He,
   accordingly, commands us to abstain from that kind of doctrine, which
   has an appearance of being evil, though it is not really so -- not that
   he allows that it should be altogether rejected, but inasmuch as it
   ought not to be received, or to obtain belief. For why has he
   previously commanded that what is good should be held fast, while he
   now desires that we should abstain not simply from evil, but from all
   appearance of evil? It is for this reason, that, when truth has been
   brought to light by careful examination, it is assuredly becoming in
   that case to give credit to it. When, on the other hand, there is any
   fear of false doctrine, or when the mind is involved in doubt, it is
   proper in that case to retreat, or to suspend our step, as they say,
   lest we should receive anything with a doubtful and perplexed
   conscience. In short, he shews us in what way prophecy will be useful
   to us without any danger -- in the event of our being attentive in
   proving all things, and our being free from lightness and haste.

   1 Thessalonians 5:23-28

   23. And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your
   whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming
   of our Lord Jesus Christ.

   23. Ipse autem Deus pacis sanctificet vos totos: et integer spiritus
   vester, et anima et corpus sine reprehensione in adventu Domini nostri
   Iesu Christi custodiatur:

   24. Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it

   24. Fidelis qui vos vocavit, qui et faciet.

   25. Brethren, pray for us.

   25. Fratres, orate pro nobis.

   26. Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.

   26. Salutate fratres omnes in osculo sancto.

   27. I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the
   holy brethren.

   27. Adiuro vos per Dominum, ut legatur epistola omnibus sanctis
   fratribus.

   28. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.

   28. Gratia Domini nostri Iesu Christi vobiscum. Amen.

   The first epistle unto the Thessalonians was written from Athens.

   Ad Thessalonicenses prima scripta fuit ex Athenis.


   23 Now the God of peace himself. Having given various injunctions, he
   now proceeds to prayer. And unquestionably doctrine is disseminated in
   vain, [620] unless God implant it in our minds. From this we see how
   preposterously those act who measure the strength of men by the
   precepts of God. Paul, accordingly, knowing that all doctrine is
   useless until God engraves it, as it were, with his own finger upon our
   hearts, beseeches God that he would sanctify the Thessalonians. Why he
   calls him here the God of peace, I do not altogether apprehend, unless
   you choose to refer it to what goes before, where he makes mention of
   brotherly agreement, and patience, and equanimity. [621]

   We know, however, that under the term sanctification is included the
   entire renovation of the man. The Thessalonians, it is true, had been
   in part renewed, but Paul desires that God would perfect what is
   remaining. From this we infer, that we must, during our whole life,
   make progress in the pursuit of holiness. [622] But if it is the part
   of God to renew the whole man, there is nothing left for free will. For
   if it had been our part to co-operate with God, Paul would have spoken
   thus -- "May God aid or promote your sanctification." But when he says,
   sanctify you wholly, he makes him the sole Author of the entire work.

   And your entire spirit. This is added by way of exposition, that we may
   know what the sanctification of the whole man is, when he is kept
   entire, or pure, and unpolluted, in spirit, soul, and body, until the
   day of Christ. As, however, so complete an entireness is never to be
   met with in this life, it is befitting that some progress be daily made
   in purity, and something be cleansed away from our pollutions, so long
   as we live in the world.

   We must notice, however, this division of the constituent parts of a
   man; for in some instances a man is said to consist simply of body and
   soul, and in that case the term soul denotes the immortal spirit, which
   resides in the body as in a dwelling. As the soul, however, has two
   principal faculties -- the understanding and the will -- the Scripture
   is accustomed in some cases to mention these two things separately,
   when designing to express the power and nature of the soul; but in that
   case the term soul is employed to mean the seat of the affections, so
   that it is the part that is opposed to the spirit. Hence, when we find
   mention made here of the term spirit, let us understand it as denoting
   reason or intelligence, as on the other hand by the term soul, is meant
   the will and all the affections.

   I am aware that many explain Paul's words otherwise, for they are of
   opinion that by the term soul is meant vital motion, and by the spirit
   is meant that part of man which has been renewed; but in that case
   Paul's prayer were absurd. Besides, it is in another way, as I have
   said, that the term is wont to be made use of in Scripture. When Isaiah
   says,

   "My soul hath desired thee in the night,
   my spirit hath thought of thee," (Isaiah 26:9)

   no one doubts that he speaks of his understanding and affection, and
   thus enumerates two departments of the soul. These two terms are
   conjoined in the Psalms in the same sense. This, also, corresponds
   better with Paul's statement. For how is the whole man entire, except
   when his thoughts are pure and holy, when all his affections are right
   and properly regulated, when, in fine, the body itself lays out its
   endeavors and services only in good works? For the faculty of
   understanding is held by philosophers to be, as it were, a mistress:
   the affections occupy a middle place for commanding; the body renders
   obedience. We see now how well everything corresponds. For then is the
   man pure and entire, when he thinks nothing in his mind, desires
   nothing in his heart, does nothing with his body, except what is
   approved by God. As, however, Paul in this manner commits to God the
   keeping of the whole man, and all its parts, we must infer from this
   that we are exposed to innumerable dangers, unless we are protected by
   his guardianship.

   24 Faithful is he that hath called you. As he has shewn by his prayer
   what care he exercised as to the welfare of the Thessalonians, so he
   now confirms them in an assurance of Divine grace. Observe, however, by
   what argument he promises them the never-failing aid of God -- because
   he has called them; by which words he means, that when the Lord has
   once adopted us as his sons, we may expect that his grace will continue
   to be exercised towards us. For he does not promise to be a Father to
   us merely for one day, but adopts us with this understanding, that he
   is to cherish us ever afterwards. Hence our calling ought to be held by
   us as an evidence of everlasting grace, for he will not leave the work
   of his hands incomplete. (Psalm 138:8) Paul, however, addresses
   believers, who had not been merely called by outward preaching, but had
   been effectually brought by Christ to the Father, that they might be of
   the number of his sons.

   26 Salute all the brethren with an holy kiss. As to the kiss, it was a
   customary token of salutation, as has been stated elsewhere. [623] In
   these words, however, he declares his affection towards all the saints.

   27 I adjure you by the Lord. It is not certain whether he feared that,
   as often happened, spiteful and envious persons would suppress the
   Epistle, or whether he wished to provide against another danger -- lest
   by a mistaken prudence and caution on the part of some, it should be
   kept among a few. [624] For there will always be found some who say
   that it is of no advantage to publish generally things that otherwise
   they recognize as very excellent. At least, whatever artifice or
   pretext Satan may have at that time contrived, in order that the
   Epistle might not come to the knowledge of all, we may gather from
   Paul's words with what earnestness and keenness he sets himself in
   opposition to it. For it is no light or frivolous thing to adjure by
   the name of God. We find, therefore, that the Spirit of God would have
   those things which he had set forth in this Epistle, through the
   ministry of Paul, to be published throughout the whole Church. Hence it
   appears, that those are more refractory than even devils themselves,
   who in the present day prohibit the people of God from reading the
   writings of Paul, inasmuch as they are no way moved by so strict an
   adjuration.

   THE AUTHOR'S DEDICATORY EPISTLE.



   TO THAT DISTINGUISHED MAN


   BENEDICT TEXTOR, PHYSICIAN.

   While you are reckoned to excel in the knowledge of your profession by
   those who are competent judges in that matter, I, for my part, have
   always regarded as a very high excellence that strict fidelity and
   diligence which you are accustomed to exercise, both in attending upon
   the sick, and in giving advice. But more especially in either restoring
   or establishing my own health, I have observed you to be so carefully
   intent, that it was easy to perceive that you were influenced not so
   much by regard to a particular individual, as by anxiety and concern
   for the common welfare of the Church. Another, perhaps, might think,
   that the kindness was smaller from its not having been shewn simply to
   himself as an individual; but as for me, I think myself on the contrary
   to be under a double obligation to you, on the ground, that while you
   omitted nothing whatever in discharging the office of a friend, you
   were at the same time equally concerned as to my ministry, too, which
   ought to be dearer to me than my life. The remembrance, besides, of my
   departed wife reminds me daily how much I owe you, not only because she
   was frequently through your assistance raised up, and was in one
   instance restored from a serious and dangerous distemper, but that even
   in that last disease, which took her away from us, you left nothing
   undone in the way of industry, labor, and effort, with a view to her
   assistance. Farther, as you do not allow me to give you any other
   remuneration, I have thought of inscribing your name upon this
   Commentary, in order that there may be some token of my good wishes
   towards you in return.

   Geneva, 1st July 1550.

   THE ARGUMENT

   ON

   THE SECOND EPISTLE TO THE THESSALONIANS.

   It does not appear to me probable that this Epistle was sent from Rome,
   as the Greek manuscripts commonly bear; for he would have made some
   mention of his bonds, as he is accustomed to do in other Epistles.
   Besides, about the end of the third Chapter, he intimates that he is in
   danger from unreasonable [625] men. From this it may be gathered, that
   when he was going to Jerusalem, he wrote this Epistle in the course of
   the journey. It was also from an ancient date a very generally received
   opinion among the Latins, that it was written at Athens. The occasion,
   however, of his writing was this -- that the Thessalonians might not
   reckon themselves overlooked, because Paul had not visited them, when
   hastening to another quarter. In the first Chapter, he exhorts them to
   patience. In the second, a vain and groundless fancy, which had got
   into circulation as to the coming of Christ being at hand, is set aside
   by him by means of this argument -- that there must previously to that
   be a revolt in the Church, and a great part of the world must
   treacherously draw back from God, nay more, that Antichrist must reign
   in the temple of God. In the third Chapter, after having commended
   himself to their prayers, and having in a few words encouraged them to
   perseverance, he commands that those be severely chastised who live in
   idleness at the expense of others. If they do not obey admonitions, he
   teaches that they should be excommunicated.

   CHAPTER 1
     __________________________________________________________________

   2 Thessalonians 1:1-7

   1. Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the
   Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:

   1. Paulus et Silvanus et Timotheus Ecclesiae Thessalonicensium in Deo
   Patre nostro et Domino Iesu Christo,

   2. Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
   Christ.

   2. Gratia vobis et pax a Deo Patre nostro et Domino Iesu Christo.

   3. We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet,
   because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every
   one of you all toward each other aboundeth;

   3. Gratias agere debemus Deo semper de vobis, fratres, quemadmodum
   dignum est, quia vehementer augescit fides vestra, et exuberat caritas
   mutua uniuscuiusque omnium vestrum;

   4. So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your
   patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye
   endure:

   4. Ut nos ipsi de vobis gloriemur in Ecclesia Dei, de tolerantia vestra
   et fide in omnibus persequutionibus vestris et afflictionibus quas
   sustinetis,

   5 Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye
   may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:

   5. Ostensionem iusti iudicii Dei: ut digni habeamini regno Dei, pro quo
   et patimini.

   6. Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to
   them that trouble you;

   6. Siquidem iustum est apud Deum reddere iis, qui vos affligunt,
   afflictionem:

   7. And to you who are troubled rest with us.

   7. Et vobis, qui affligimini, relaxationem nobiscum.


   1 To the Church of the Thessalonians which is in God. As to the form of
   salutation, it were superfluous to speak. This only it is necessary to
   notice -- that by a Church in God and Christ is meant one that has not
   merely been gathered together under the banner of faith, for the
   purpose of worshipping one God the Father, and confiding in Christ, but
   is the work and building as well of the Father as of Christ, because
   while God adopts us to himself, and regenerates us, we from him begin
   to be in Christ. (1 Corinthians 1:30)

   3 To give thanks. He begins with commendation, that he may have
   occasion to pass on to exhortation, for in this way we have more
   success among those who have already entered upon the course, when
   without passing over in silence their former progress, we remind them
   how far distant they are as yet from the goal, and stir them up to make
   progress. As, however, he had in the former Epistle commended their
   faith and love, he now declares the increase of both. And,
   unquestionably, this course ought to be pursued by all the pious -- to
   examine themselves daily, and see how far they have advanced. This,
   therefore, is the true commendation of believers -- their growing daily
   in faith and love. When he says always, he means that he is constantly
   supplied with new occasion. He had previously given thanks to God on
   their account. He says that he has now occasion to do so again, on the
   ground of daily progress. When, however, he gives thanks to God on this
   account, he declares that the enlargements, no less than the
   beginnings, of faith and love are from him, for if they proceeded from
   the power of men, thanksgiving would be pretended, or at least
   worthless. Farther, he shews that their proficiency was not trivial, or
   even ordinary, but most abundant. So much the more disgraceful is our
   slowness, inasmuch as we scarcely advance one foot during a long space
   of time.

   As is meet. In these words Paul shews that we are bound to give thanks
   to God, not only when he does us good, but also when we take into view
   the favors bestowed by him upon our brethren. For wherever the goodness
   of God shines forth, it becomes us to extol it. Farther, the welfare of
   our brethren ought to be so dear to us, that we ought to reckon among
   our own benefits everything that has been conferred upon them. Nay
   more, if we consider the nature and sacredness of the unity of Christ's
   body, such a mutual fellowship will have place among us, that we shall
   reckon the benefits conferred upon an individual member as gain to the
   whole Church. Hence, in extolling God's benefits, we must always have
   an eye to the whole body of the Church.

   4 So that we ourselves glory in you. He could not have bestowed higher
   commendation upon them, than by saying that he sets them forward before
   other Churches as a pattern, for such is the meaning of those words: --
   We glory in you in the presence of other Churches. For Paul did not
   boast of the faith of the Thessalonians from a spirit of ambition, but
   inasmuch as his commendation of them might be an incitement to make it
   their endeavor to imitate them. He does not say, however, that he
   glories in their faith and love, but in their patience and faith. Hence
   it follows, that patience is the fruit and evidence of faith. These
   words ought, therefore, to be explained in this manner: -- "We glory in
   the patience which springs from faith, and we bear witness that it
   eminently shines forth in you;" otherwise the context would not
   correspond. And, undoubtedly, there is nothing that sustains us in
   tribulations as faith does; which is sufficiently manifest from this,
   that we altogether sink down so soon as the promises of God leave us.
   Hence, the more proficiency any one makes in faith, he will be so much
   the more endued with patience for enduring all things with fortitude,
   as on the other hand, softness and impatience under adversity betoken
   unbelief on our part; but more especially when persecutions are to be
   endured for the gospel, the influence of faith in that case discovers
   itself.

   5 A demonstration of the righteous judgment of God. Without mentioning
   the exposition given by others, I am of opinion that the true meaning
   is this -- that the injuries and persecutions which innocent and pious
   persons endure from the wicked and abandoned, shew clearly, as in a
   mirror, that God will one day be the judge of the world. And this
   statement is quite at antipodes with that profane notion, which we are
   accustomed to entertain, whenever it goes well with the good and ill
   with the wicked. For we think that the world is under the regulation of
   mere chance, and we leave God no control. Hence it is that impiety and
   contempt take possession of men's hearts, as Solomon speaks,
   (Ecclesiastes 9:3) for those that suffer anything undeservedly either
   throw the blame upon God, or do not think that he concerns himself as
   to the affairs of men. We hear what Ovid says, -- "I am tempted to
   think that there are no gods." [626] Nay more, David confesses (Psalm
   73:1-12) that, because he saw things in so confused a state in the
   world, he had well-nigh lost his footing, as in a slippery place. On
   the other hand, the wicked become more insolent through occasion of
   prosperity, as if no punishment of their crimes awaited them; just as
   Dionysius, when making a prosperous voyage, [627] boasted that the gods
   favored the sacrilegious. [628] In fine, when we see that the cruelty
   of the wicked against the innocent walks abroad with impunity, carnal
   sense concludes that there is no judgment of God, that there are no
   punishments of the wicked, that there is no reward of righteousness.

   Paul, however, declares on the other hand, that as God thus spares the
   wicked for a time, and winks at the injuries inflicted upon his people,
   His judgment to come is shewn us as in a mirror. For he takes for
   granted that it cannot but be that God, inasmuch as he is a just Judge,
   will one day restore peace to the miserable, who are now unjustly
   harassed, and will pay to the oppressors of the pious the reward that
   they have merited. Hence, if we hold this principle of faith, that God
   is the just Judge of the world, and that it is his office to render to
   every one a recompense according to his works, this second principle
   will follow incontrovertibly -- that the present disorderly state of
   matters (ataxian) is a demonstration of the judgment, which does not
   yet appear. For if God is the righteous Judge of the world, those
   things that are now confused must, of necessity, be restored to order.
   Now, nothing is more disorderly than that the wicked, with impunity,
   give molestation to the good, and walk abroad with unbridled violence,
   while the good are cruelly harassed without any fault on their part.
   From this it may be readily inferred, that God will one day ascend the
   judgment-seat, that he may remedy the state of matters in the world, so
   as to bring them into a better condition.

   Hence the statement which he subjoins -- that it is righteous with God
   to appoint affliction, etc., is the groundwork of this doctrine -- that
   God furnishes tokens of a judgment to come when he refrains, for the
   present, from exercising the office of judge. And unquestionably, if
   matters were now arranged in a tolerable way, so that the judgment of
   God might be recognized as having been fully exercised, an adjustment
   of this nature would detain us upon earth. Hence God, in order that he
   may stir us up to the hope of a judgment to come, does, for the
   present, only to some extent judge the world. He furnishes, it is true,
   many tokens of his judgment, but it is in such a manner as to constrain
   us to extend our hope farther. A remarkable passage truly, as teaching
   us in what manner our minds ought to be raised up above all the
   impediments of the world, whenever we suffer any adversity -- that the
   righteous judgment of God may present itself to our mind, which will
   raise us above this world. Thus death will be an image of life.

   May be accounted worthy. There are no persecutions that are to be
   reckoned of such value as to make us worthy of the kingdom of God, nor
   does Paul dispute here as to the ground of worthiness, but simply takes
   the common doctrine of Scripture -- that God destroys in us those
   things that are of the world, that he may restore in us a better life;
   and farther, that by means of afflictions he shews us the value of
   eternal life. In short, he simply points out the manner in which
   believers are prepared and, as it were, polished under God's anvil,
   inasmuch as, by afflictions, they are taught to renounce the world and
   to aim at God's heavenly kingdom. Farther, they are confirmed in the
   hope of eternal life while they fight for it. For this is the entrance
   of which Christ discoursed to his disciples. (Matthew 7:13; Luke 13:24)

   6 To appoint affliction. We have already stated why it is that he makes
   mention of the vengeance of God against the wicked -- that we may learn
   to rest in the expectation of a judgment to come, because God does not
   as yet avenge the wicked, while it is, nevertheless, necessary that
   they should suffer the punishment of their crimes. Believers, however,
   at the same time, understand by this that there is no reason why they
   should envy the momentary and evanescent felicity of the wicked, which
   will ere long be exchanged for a dreadful destruction. What he adds as
   to the rest of the pious, accords with the statement of Paul, (Acts
   3:20,) where he calls the day of the last judgment the day of
   refreshing

   In this declaration, however, as to the good and the bad, he designed
   to shew more clearly how unjust and confused the government of the
   world would be, if God did not defer punishments and rewards till
   another judgment, for in this way the name of God were a thing that was
   dead. [629] Hence he is deprived of his office and power by all that
   are not intent on that righteousness of which Paul speaks.

   He adds with us, that he may gain credit to his doctrine from his
   experience of belief in his own mind; for he shews that he does not
   philosophize as to things unknown, by putting himself into the same
   condition, and into the same rank with them. We know, however, how much
   more authority is due to those who have, by long practice, been
   exercised in those things which they teach, and do not require from
   others anything but what they are themselves prepared to do. Paul,
   therefore, does not, while himself in the shade, give instructions to
   the Thessalonians as to how they should fight in the heat of the sun,
   but, fighting vigorously, exhorts them to the same warfare. [630]

   2 Thessalonians 1:7-10

   7. When the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty
   angels,

   7. Quum manifestabitur Dominus Iesus e coelo cum angelis potentiae
   suae,

   8. In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that
   obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:

   8. In igne flammanti, qui ultionem infliget iis, qui non noverunt Deum,
   et non obediunt evangelio Domini nostri Iesu Christi:

   9 Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence
   of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;

   9. Qui poenam dabunt interitum aeternum a facie Domini, et a gloria
   potentiae ipsius,

   10. When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired
   in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed)
   in that day.

   10. Quum venerit ut sanctificetur in sanctis suis, et admirabilis
   reddatur in omnibus, qui credunt (quia fides habita sit testimonio
   nostro erga vos) in illa die.


   7 When the Lord shall be manifested. Here we have a confirmation of the
   foregoing statement. For as it is one of the articles of our faith,
   that Christ will come from heaven, and will not come in vain, faith
   ought to seek the end of his coming. Now this is -- that he may come as
   a Redeemer to his own people; nay more, that he may judge the whole
   world. The description which follows has a view to this -- that the
   pious may understand that God is so much the more concerned as to their
   afflictions in proportion to the dreadfulness of the judgment that
   awaits his enemies. For the chief occasion of grief and distress is
   this -- that we think that God is but lightly affected with our
   calamities. We see into what complaints David from time to time breaks
   forth, while he is consumed by the pride and insolence of his enemies.
   Hence he has brought forward all this for the consolation of believers,
   while he represents the tribunal of Christ as full of horror, [631]
   that they may not be disheartened by their present oppressed condition,
   while they see themselves proudly and disdainfully trampled upon by the
   wicked.

   What is to be the nature of that fire, and of what materials, I leave
   to the disputations of persons of foolish curiosity. I am contented
   with holding what Paul had it in view to teach -- that Christ will be a
   most strict avenger of the injuries which the wicked inflict upon us.
   The metaphor, however, of flame and fire, is abundantly common in
   Scripture, when the anger of God is treated of.

   By the angels of his power, he means those in whom he will exercise his
   power; for he will bring the angels with him for the purpose of
   displaying the glory of his kingdom. Hence, too, they are elsewhere
   called the angels of his majesty

   8 Who will inflict vengeance. That he may the better persuade believers
   that the persecutions which they endure will not go unpunished, he
   teaches that this also involves the interests of God himself, inasmuch
   as the same persons that persecute the pious are guilty of rebellion
   against God. Hence it is necessary that God should inflict vengeance
   upon them not merely with a view to our salvation, but also for the
   sake of his own glory. Farther, this expression, who will inflict
   vengeance, relates to Christ, for Paul intimates that this office is
   assigned to him by God the Father. It may be asked, however, whether it
   is lawful for us to desire vengeance, for Paul promises it, as though
   it could be lawfully desired. I answer, that it is not lawful to desire
   vengeance upon any one, inasmuch as we are commanded to wish well to
   all. Besides, although we may in a general way desire vengeance upon
   the wicked, yet, as we do not as yet discriminate them, we ought to
   desire the welfare of all. In the mean time, the ruin of the wicked may
   be lawfully looked forward to with desire, provided there reigns in our
   hearts a pure and duly regulated zeal for God, and there is no feeling
   of inordinate desire.

   Who know not. He distinguishes unbelievers by these two marks -- that
   they know not God, and obey not the gospel of Christ. For if obedience
   is not rendered to the gospel through faith, as he teaches in the first
   and in the last chapters of the Epistle to the Romans, [Romans 1:18ff,
   16:17-19,] unbelief is the occasion of resistance to it. He charges
   them at the same time with ignorance of God, for a lively acquaintance
   with God produces of itself reverence towards him. Hence unbelief is
   always blind, not as though unbelievers were altogether devoid of light
   and intelligence, but because they have the understanding darkened in
   such a manner, that seeing they do not see. (Matthew 13:13.) It is not
   without good grounds that Christ declares that this is life eternal, to
   know the true God, etc. (John 17:3.) Accordingly, from the want of this
   salutary knowledge, there follows contempt of God, and in fine, death.
   On this point I have treated more fully in commenting on the first
   chapter of First Corinthians. [632]

   9. Everlasting destruction from the face. He shews, by apposition, what
   is the nature of the punishment of which he had made mention --
   destruction without end, and an undying death. The perpetuity of the
   death is proved from the circumstance, that it has the glory of Christ
   as its opposite. Now, this is eternal, and has no end. Accordingly, the
   influence of that death will never cease. From this also the dreadful
   severity of the punishment may be inferred, inasmuch as it will be
   great in proportion to the glory and majesty of Christ.

   10 When he shall come to be sanctified. As he has hitherto discoursed
   as to the punishment of the wicked, he now returns to the pious, and
   says that Christ will come, that he may be glorified in them; that is,
   that he may irradiate them with his glory, and that they may be
   partakers of it. "Christ will not have this glory for himself
   individually; but it will be common to all the saints." This is the
   crowning and choice consolation of the pious, that when the Son of God
   will be manifested in the glory of his kingdom, he will gather them
   into the same fellowship with himself. [633] There is, however, an
   implied contrast between the present condition in which believers labor
   and groan, and that final restoration. For they are now exposed to the
   reproaches of the world, and are looked upon as vile and worthless; but
   then they will be precious, and full of dignity, when Christ will pour
   forth his glory upon them. The end of this is, that the pious may as it
   were, with closed eyes, pursue the brief journey of this earthly life,
   having their minds always intent upon the future manifestation of
   Christ's kingdom. For to what purpose does he make mention of His
   coming in power, but in order that they may in hope leap forward to
   that blessed resurrection which is as yet hid?

   It is also to be observed, that after having made use of the term
   saints, he adds, by way of explanation -- those that believe, by which
   he intimates that there is no holiness in men without faith, but that
   all are profane. In the close he again repeats the terms -- in that
   day, for that expression is connected with this sentence. Now, he
   repeats it with this view, that he may repress the desires of
   believers, lest they should hasten forward beyond due bounds.

   Because credit was given What he had said in a general way as to
   saints, he now applies to the Thessalonians, that they may not doubt
   that they are of that number.

   "Because," says he, "my preaching has obtained credit among you, Christ
   has already enrolled you in the number of his own people, whom he will
   make partakers of his glory."

   He calls his doctrine a testimony, because the Apostles are Christ's
   witnesses. (Acts 1:8.) Let us learn, therefore, that the promises of
   God are ratified in us, when they gain credit with us.

   2 Thessalonians 1:11-12

   11. Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you
   worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his
   goodness, and the work of faith with power:

   11. In quam rem etiam oramus semper pro vobis: ut vos habeat dignos
   vocatione Deus noster, et impleat omne beneplacitum bonitatis, et opus
   fidei cum potentia [634]

   12. That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and
   ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.

   12. Quo glorificetur nomen Domini nostri Iesu Christi in vobis, et vos
   in ipso, secundum gratiam Dei nostri, et Domini Iesu Christi.


   11 On which account we pray always. That they may know that they need
   continual help from God, he declares that he prays in their behalf.
   When he says on this account, he means, in order that they may reach
   that final goal of their course, as appears from the succeeding
   context, that he would fulfill all the good pleasure, etc. It may seem,
   however, as if what he has mentioned first were unnecessary, for God
   had already accounted them worthy of his calling. He speaks, however,
   as to the end or completion, which depends on perseverance. For as we
   are liable to give way, our calling would not fail, so far as we are
   concerned, to prove sooner or later vain, if God did not confirm it.
   Hence he is said to account us worthy, when he conducts us to the point
   at which we aimed.

   And fulfill. Paul goes to an amazing height in extolling the grace of
   God, for not contenting himself with the term good pleasure, he says
   that it flows from his goodness, unless perhaps any one should prefer
   to consider the beneficence [635] as arising from this good pleasure,
   which amounts to the same thing. When, however, we are instructed that
   the gracious purpose of God is the cause of our salvation, and that
   that has its foundation in the goodness of the same God, are we not
   worse than mad, if we venture to ascribe anything, however small, to
   our own merits? For the words are in no small degree emphatic. He might
   have said in one word, that your faith may be fulfilled, but he terms
   it good pleasure. Farther, he expresses the idea still more distinctly
   by saying, that God was prompted by nothing else than his own goodness,
   for he finds nothing in us but misery.

   Nor does Paul ascribe to the grace of God merely the beginning of our
   salvation, but all departments of it. Thus that contrivance of the
   Sophists is set aside, that we are, indeed, anticipated by the grace of
   God, but that it is helped by subsequent merits. Paul, on the other
   hand, recognizes in the whole progress of our salvation nothing but the
   pure grace of God. As, however, the good pleasure of God has been
   already accomplished in him, referring in the term subsequently
   employed by him to the effect which appears in us, he explains his
   meaning when he says -- and work of faith. And he calls it a work, with
   regard to God, who works or produces faith in us, as though he had said
   -- "that he may complete the building of faith which he has begun."

   It is, also, not without good reason, that he says with power, for he
   intimates that the perfecting of faith is an arduous matter, and one of
   the greatest difficulty. This, also, we know but too well from
   experience; and the reason, too, is not far to seek, if we consider how
   great our weakness is, how various are the hindrances that obstruct us
   on every side, and how severe are the assaults of Satan. Hence, unless
   the power of God afford us help in no ordinary degree, faith will never
   rise to its full height. For it is no easier task to bring faith to
   perfection in an individual, than to rear upon water a tower that may
   by its firmness withstand all storms and fury of tempests, and may
   surmount the clouds in height, for we are not less fluid than water,
   and it is necessary that the height of faith reach as high as heaven.

   12 That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified. He calls us
   back to the chief end of our whole life -- that we may promote the
   Lord's glory. What he adds, however, is more especially worthy of
   notice, that those who have advanced the glory of Christ will also in
   their turn be glorified in him. For in this, first of all, the
   wonderful goodness of God shines forth -- that he will have his glory
   be conspicuous in us who are covered over with ignominy. This, however,
   is a twofold miracle, that he afterwards irradiates us with his glory,
   as though he would do the same to us in return. On this account he
   adds, according to the grace of God and Christ. For there is nothing
   here that is ours either in the action itself, or in the effect or
   fruit, for it is solely by the guidance of the Holy Spirit that our
   life is made to contribute to the glory of God. And the circumstance
   that so much fruit arises from this ought to be ascribed to the great
   mercy of God. In the mean time, if we are not worse than stupid, we
   must aim with all our might at the advancement of the glory of Christ,
   which is connected with ours. I deem it unnecessary to explain at
   present in what sense he represents the glory as belonging to God and
   Christ in common, as I have explained this elsewhere.

   CHAPTER 2
     __________________________________________________________________

   2 Thessalonians 2:1-2

   1. Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,

   1. Rogo autem vos, fratres, per adventum (vel, de adventu) Domini
   nostri Iesu Christi, et nostri in ipsum aggregationem,

   2. That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by
   spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of
   Christ is at hand.

   2. Ne cito dimoveamini a mente, neque turbemini vel per spiritum, vel
   per sermonem, vel per epistolam, tanquam a nobis scriptam, quasi instet
   dies Christi.


   1 Now I beseech you, by the coming. It may indeed be read, as I have
   noted on the margin, concerning the coming, but it suits better to view
   it as an earnest entreaty, taken from the subject in hand, just as in 1
   Corinthians 15:31, when discoursing as to the hope of a resurrection,
   he makes use of an oath by that glory which is to be hoped for by
   believers. And this has much more efficacy when he adjures believers by
   the coming of Christ, not to imagine rashly that his day is at hand,
   for he at the same time admonishes us not to think of it but with
   reverence and sobriety. For it is customary to adjure by those things
   which are regarded by us with reverence. The meaning therefore is, "As
   you set a high value on the coming of Christ, when he will gather us to
   himself, and will truly perfect that unity of the body which we cherish
   as yet only in part through means of faith, so I earnestly beseech you
   by his coming not to be too credulous, should any one affirm, on
   whatever pretext, that his day is at hand."

   As he had in his former Epistle adverted to some extent to the
   resurrection, it is possible that some fickle and fanatical persons
   took occasion from this to mark out a near and fixed day. For it is not
   likely that this error had taken its rise earlier among the
   Thessalonians. For Timothy, on returning thence, had informed Paul as
   to their entire condition, and as a prudent and experienced man had
   omitted nothing that was of importance. Now if Paul had received notice
   of it, he could not have been silent as to a matter of so great
   consequence. Thus I am of opinion, that when Paul's Epistle had been
   read, which contained a lively view of the resurrection, some that were
   disposed to indulge curiosity philosophized unseasonably as to the time
   of it. This, however, was an utterly ruinous fancy, [636] as were also
   other things of the same nature, which were afterwards disseminated,
   not without artifice on the part of Satan. For when any day is said to
   be near, if it does not quickly arrive, mankind being naturally
   impatient of longer delay, their spirits begin to languish, and that
   languishing is followed up shortly afterwards by despair.

   This, therefore, was Satan's subtlety: as he could not openly overturn
   the hope of a resurrection with the view of secretly undermining it, as
   if by pits underground, [637] he promised that the day of it would be
   near, and would soon arrive. Afterwards, too, he did not cease to
   contrive various things, with the view of effacing, by little and
   little, the belief of a resurrection from the minds of men, as he could
   not openly eradicate it. It is, indeed, a plausible thing to say that
   the day of our redemption is definitely fixed, and on this account it
   meets with applause on the part of the multitude, as we see that the
   dreams of Lactantius and the Chiliasts of old gave much delight, and
   yet they had no other tendency than that of overthrowing the hope of a
   resurrection. This was not the design of Lactantius, but Satan, in
   accordance with his subtlety, perverted his curiosity, and that of
   those like him, so as to leave nothing in religion definite or fixed,
   and even at the present day he does not cease to employ the same means.
   We now see how necessary Paul's admonition was, as but for this all
   religion would have been overturned among the Thessalonians under a
   specious pretext.

   2 That ye be not soon shaken in judgment. He employs the term judgment
   to denote that settled faith which rests on sound doctrine. Now, by
   means of that fancy which he rejects, they would have been carried away
   as it were into ecstasy. He notices, also, three kinds of imposture, as
   to which they must be on their guard -- spirit, word, and spurious
   epistle. By the term spirit he means pretended prophecies, and it
   appears that this mode of speaking was common among the pious, so that
   they applied the term spirit to prophesyings, with the view of putting
   honor upon them. For, in order that prophecies may have due authority,
   we must look to the Spirit of God rather than to men. But as the devil
   is wont to transform himself into an angel of light, (2 Corinthians
   11:14,) impostors stole this title, in order that they might impose
   upon the simple. But although Paul could have stripped them of this
   mask, he, nevertheless, preferred to speak in this manner, by way of
   concession, as though he had said, "However they may pretend to have
   the spirit of revelation, believe them not." John, in like manner,
   says:

   "Try the spirits, whether they are of God." (1 John 4:1.)

   Speech, in my opinion, includes every kind of doctrine, while false
   teachers insist in the way of reasons or conjectures, or other
   pretexts. What he adds as to epistle, is an evidence that this
   impudence is ancient -- that of feigning the names of others. [638] So
   much the more wonderful is the mercy of God towards us, in that while
   Paul's name was on false grounds made use of in spurious writings, his
   writings have, nevertheless, been preserved entire even to our times.
   This, unquestionably, could not have taken place accidentally, or as
   the effect of mere human industry, if God himself had not by his power
   restrained Satan and all his ministers.

   As if the day of Christ were at hand. This may seem to be at variance
   with many passages of Scripture, in which the Spirit declares that that
   day is at hand. But the solution is easy, for it is at hand with regard
   to God, with whom one day is as a thousand years. (2 Peter 3:8.) In the
   mean time, the Lord would have us be constantly waiting for him in such
   a way as not to limit him to a certain time.

   Watch, says he, for ye know neither the day nor the hour.
   (Matthew 24:32.)

   On the other hand, those false prophets whom Paul exposes, while they
   ought to have kept men's minds in suspense, bid them feel assured of
   his speedy advent, that they might not be wearied out with the
   irksomeness of delay.

   2 Thessalonians 2:3-4

   3. Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come,
   except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be
   revealed, the son of perdition;

   3. Ne quis vos decipiat ullo modo; quia nisi prius venerit discessio,
   et nisi revelatus fuerit sceleratus ille filius perditus,

   4. Who opposeth and exhalteth himself above all that is called God, or
   that is worshipped; so that he, as God, sitteth in the temple of God,
   shewing himself that he is God.

   4. Adverserius, et qui se extollit adversus omne, quod dicitur Deus,
   aut numen: ita ut ipse in templo Dei tanquam Deus sedeat, ostendens se
   ipsum quasi sit Deus.


   3 Let no man deceive you. That they may not groundlessly promise
   themselves the arrival in so short a time of the joyful day of
   redemption, he presents to them a melancholy prediction as to the
   future scattering of the Church. This discourse entirely corresponds
   with that which Christ held in the presence of his disciples, when they
   had asked him respecting the end of the world. For he exhorts them to
   prepare themselves for enduring hard conflicts, [639] (Matthew 24:6,)
   and after he has discoursed of the most grievous and previously unheard
   of calamities, by which the earth was to be reduced almost to a desert,
   he adds, that the end is not yet, but that these things are the
   beginnings of sorrows. In the same way, Paul declares that believers
   must exercise warfare for a long period, before gaining a triumph.

   We have here, however, a remarkable passage, and one that is in the
   highest degree worthy of observation. This was a grievous and dangerous
   temptation, which might shake even the most confirmed, and make them
   lose their footing -- to see the Church, which had by means of such
   labors been raised up gradually and with difficulty to some
   considerable standing, fall down suddenly, as if torn down by a
   tempest. Paul, accordingly, fortifies beforehand the minds, not merely
   of the Thessalonians, but of all the pious, that when the Church should
   come to be in a scattered condition, they might not be alarmed, as
   though it were a thing that was new and unlooked for.

   As, however, interpreters have twisted this passage in various ways, we
   must first of all endeavor to ascertain Paul's true meaning. He says
   that the day of Christ will not come, until the world has fallen into
   apostasy, and the reign of Antichrist has obtained a footing in the
   Church; for as to the exposition that some have given of this passage,
   as referring to the downfall of the Roman empire, it is too silly to
   require a lengthened refutation. I am also surprised, that so many
   writers, in other respects learned and acute, have fallen into a
   blunder in a matter that is so easy, were it not that when one has
   committed a mistake, others follow in troops without consideration.
   Paul, therefore, employs the term apostasy to mean -- a treacherous
   departure from God, and that not on the part of one or a few
   individuals, but such as would spread itself far and wide among a large
   multitude of persons. For when apostasy is made mention of without
   anything being added, it cannot be restricted to a few. Now, none can
   be termed apostates, but such as have previously made a profession of
   Christ and the gospel. Paul, therefore, predicts a certain general
   revolt of the visible Church. "The Church must be reduced to an
   unsightly and dreadful state of ruin, before its full restoration be
   effected."

   From this we may readily gather, how useful this prediction of Paul is,
   for it might have seemed as though that could not be a building of God,
   that was suddenly overthrown, and lay so long in ruins, had not Paul
   long before intimated that it would be so. Nay more, many in the
   present day, when they consider with themselves the long-continued
   dispersion of the Church, begin to waver, as if this had not been
   regulated by the purpose of God. The Romanists, also, with the view of
   justifying the tyranny of their idol, make use of this pretext -- that
   it was not possible that Christ would forsake his spouse. The weak,
   however, have something here on which to rest, when they learn that the
   unseemly state of matters which they behold in the Church was long
   since foretold; while, on the other hand, the impudence of the
   Romanists is openly exposed, inasmuch as Paul declares that a revolt
   will come, when the world has been brought under Christ's authority.
   Now, we shall see presently, why it is that the Lord has permitted the
   Church, or at least what appeared to be such, to fall off in so
   shameful a manner.

   Has been revealed. It was no better than an old wife's fable that was
   contrived respecting Nero, that he was carried up from the world,
   destined to return again to harass the Church [640] by his tyranny; and
   yet the minds of the ancients were so bewitched, that they imagined
   that Nero would be Antichrist. [641] Paul, however, does not speak of
   one individual, but of a kingdom, that was to be taken possession of by
   Satan, that he might set up a seat of abomination in the midst of God's
   temple -- which we see accomplished in Popery. The revolt, it is true,
   has spread more widely, for Mahomet, as he was an apostate, turned away
   the Turks, his followers, from Christ. All heretics have broken the
   unity of the Church by their sects, and thus there have been a
   corresponding number of revolts from Christ.

   Paul, however, when he has given warning that there would be such a
   scattering, that the greater part would revolt from Christ, adds
   something more serious -- that there would be such a confusion, that
   the vicar of Satan would hold supreme power in the Church, and would
   preside there in the place of God. Now he describes that reign of
   abomination under the name of a single person, because it is only one
   reign, though one succeeds another. My readers now understand, that all
   the sects by which the Church has been lessened from the beginning,
   have been so many streams of revolt which began to draw away the water
   from the right course, but that the sect of Mahomet was like a violent
   bursting forth of water, that took away about the half of the Church by
   its violence. It remained, also, that Antichrist should infect the
   remaining part with his poison. Thus, we see with our own eyes, that
   this memorable prediction of Paul has been confirmed by the event.

   In the exposition which I bring forward, there is nothing forced.
   Believers in that age dreamed that they would be transported to heaven,
   after having endured troubles during a short period. Paul, however, on
   the other hand, foretells that, after they have had foreign enemies for
   some time molesting them, they will have more evils to endure from
   enemies at home, inasmuch as many of those that have made a profession
   of attachment to Christ would be hurried away into base treachery, and
   inasmuch as the temple of God itself would be polluted by sacrilegious
   tyranny, so that Christ's greatest enemy would exercise dominion there.
   The term revelation is taken here to denote manifest possession of
   tyranny, as if Paul had said that the day of Christ would not come
   until this tyrant had openly manifested himself, and had, as it were,
   designedly overturned the whole order of the Church.

   4 An adversary, and that exalteth himself. The two epithets -- man of
   sin, and son of perdition -- intimate, in the first place, how dreadful
   the confusion would be, that the unseemliness of it might not
   discourage weak minds; and farther, they tend to stir up the pious to a
   feeling of detestation, lest they should degenerate along with others.
   Paul, however, now draws, as if in a picture, a striking likeness of
   Antichrist; for it may be easily gathered from these words what is the
   nature of his kingdom, and in what things it consists. For, when he
   calls him an adversary, when he says that he will claim for himself
   those things which belong to God, so that he is worshipped in the
   temple as God, he places his kingdom in direct opposition to the
   kingdom of Christ. Hence, as the kingdom of Christ is spiritual, so
   this tyranny must be upon souls, that it may rival the kingdom of
   Christ. We shall also find him afterwards assigning to him the power of
   deceiving, by means of wicked doctrines and pretended miracles. If,
   accordingly, you would know Antichrist, you must view him as
   diametrically opposed to Christ. [642]

   Where I have rendered -- everything that is called God, the reading
   more generally received among the Greeks is, every one that is called.
   It may, however, be conjectured, both from the old translation [643]
   and from some Greek commentaries, that Paul's words have been
   corrupted. The mistake, too, of a single letter was readily fallen
   into, especially when the shape of the letter was much similar; for,
   where there was written pan to, (everything,) some transcriber, or too
   daring reader, turned it into panta, (every one.) This difference,
   however, is not of so much importance as to the sense, for Paul
   undoubtedly means that Antichrist would take to himself those things
   that belonged to God alone, so that he would exalt himself above every
   divine claim, that all religion and all worship of God might lie under
   his feet. This expression then, everything that is reckoned to be God,
   is equivalent to everything that is reckoned as Divinity, and sebasma,
   that is, in which the veneration due to God consists.

   Here, however, the subject treated of is not the name of God himself,
   but his majesty and worship, and, in general, everything that he claims
   for himself. "True religion is that by which the true God alone is
   worshipped; that, the son of perdition will transfer to himself." Now,
   every one that has learned from Scripture what are the things that more
   especially belong to God, and will, on the other hand, observe what the
   Pope claims for himself -- though he were but a boy of ten years of age
   -- will have no great difficulty in recognizing Antichrist. Scripture
   declares that God is the alone Lawgiver (James 4:12) who is able to
   save and to destroy; the alone King, whose office it is to govern souls
   by his word. It represents him as the author of all sacred rites; [644]
   it teaches that righteousness and salvation are to be sought from
   Christ alone; and it assigns, at the same time, the manner and means.
   There is not one of these things that the Pope does not affirm to be
   under his authority. He boasts that it is his to bind consciences with
   such laws as seem good to him, and subject them to everlasting
   punishment. As to sacraments, he either institutes new ones, according
   to his own inclination, [645] or he corrupts and deforms those which
   had been instituted by Christ -- nay, sets them aside altogether, that
   he may substitute in their place the sacrileges [646] which he has
   invented. He contrives means of attaining salvation that are altogether
   at variance with the doctrine of the Gospel; and, in fine, he does not
   hesitate to change the whole of religion at his own pleasure. What is
   it, I pray you, for one to lift up himself above everything that is
   reckoned God, if the Pope does not do so? When he thus robs God of his
   honor, he leaves him nothing remaining but an empty title of Deity,
   [647] while he transfers to himself the whole of his power. And this is
   what Paul adds shortly afterwards, that the son of perdition would shew
   himself as God. For, as has been said, he does not insist upon the
   simple term God, but intimates, that the pride [648] of Antichrist
   would be such, that, raising himself above the number and rank of
   servants, and mounting the judgment-seat of God, [649] would reign, not
   with a human, but with a divine authority. For we know that whatever is
   raised up into the place of God is an idol, though it should not bear
   the name of God.

   In the temple of God. By this one term there is a sufficient refutation
   of the error, nay more, the stupidity of those who reckon the Pope to
   be Vicar of Christ, on the ground that he has his seat in the Church,
   in whatever manner he may conduct himself; for Paul places Antichrist
   nowhere else than in the very sanctuary of God. For this is not a
   foreign, but a domestic enemy, who opposes Christ under the very name
   of Christ. But it is asked, how the Church is represented as the den of
   so many superstitions, while it was destined to be the pillar of the
   truth? (1 Timothy 3:15.) I answer, that it is thus represented, not on
   the ground of its retaining all the qualities of the Church, but
   because it has something of it remaining. I accordingly acknowledge,
   that that is the temple of God in which the Pope bears rule, but at the
   same time profaned by innumerable sacrileges.

   2 Thessalonians 2:5-8

   5. Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these
   things?

   5. Annon memoria tenetis, quod, quum adhuc essem apud vos, haec vobis
   dicebam?

   6. And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his
   time.

   6. Et nunc quid detineat, scitis, donec ille reveletur suo tempore.

   7. For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now
   letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.

   7. Mysterium enim iam operatur iniquitatis, solum tenens modo donec e
   medio tollatur.

   8. And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume
   with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of
   his coming:

   8. Et tunc revelabitur iniquus ille, quem Dominus destruet spiritu oris
   sui, et abolebit illustratione adventus sui.


   5 Do ye not remember? This added no small weight to the doctrine, that
   they had previously heard it from the mouth of Paul, that they might
   not think that it had been contrived by him at the instant. And as he
   had given them early warning as to the reign of Antichrist, and the
   devastation that was coming upon the Church, when no question had as
   yet been raised as to such things, he saw beyond all doubt that the
   doctrine was specially useful to be known. And, unquestionably, it is
   really so. Those whom he addressed were destined to see many things
   that would trouble them; and when posterity would see a large
   proportion of those who had made profession of the faith of Christ
   revolt from piety, maddened, as it were, by a gad-fly, or rather by a
   fury, [650] what could they do but waver? This, however, was as a
   brazen [651] wall [652] -- that matters were so appointed by God,
   because the ingratitude of men [653] was worthy of such vengeance. Here
   we may see how forgetful men are in matters affecting their everlasting
   salvation. We must also observe Paul's mildness; for while he might
   have been vehemently incensed, [654] he does but mildly reprove them;
   for it is a fatherly way of reproving them to say to them, that they
   had allowed forgetfulness of a matter so important and so useful to
   steal in upon their minds.

   6. And now what withholdeth To katechon means here properly an
   impediment or occasion of delay. Chrysostom, who thinks that this can
   only be understood as referring to the Spirit, or to the Roman Empire,
   prefers to lean to the latter opinion. He assigns a plausible reason --
   because Paul would not have spoken of the Spirit in enigmatical terms,
   [655] but in speaking of the Roman Empire wished to avoid exciting
   unpleasant feeling. He states also the reason why the state of the
   Roman Empire retards the revelation of Antichrist -- that, as the
   monarchy of Babylon was overthrown by the Persians and Medes, and the
   Macedonians, having conquered the Persians, again took possession of
   the monarchy, and the Macedonians were at last subdued by the Romans,
   so Antichrist seized hold for himself of the vacant supremacy of the
   Roman Empire. There is not one of these things that was not afterwards
   confirmed by actual occurrence. Chrysostom, therefore, speaks truly in
   so far as concerns history. I am of opinion, however, that Paul's
   intention was different from this -- that the doctrine of the gospel
   would require to be spread hither and thither, until nearly the whole
   world were convicted of obstinacy and deliberate malice. For there can
   be no doubt that the Thessalonians had heard from Paul's mouth as to
   this impediment, of whatever sort it was, for he recalls to their
   remembrance what he had previously taught in their presence.

   Let my readers now consider which of the two is the more probable --
   either that Paul declared that the light of the gospel must be diffused
   through all parts of the earth before God would thus give loose reins
   to Satan, or that the power of the Roman Empire stood in the way of the
   rise of Antichrist, inasmuch as he could only break through into a
   vacant possession. I seem at least to hear Paul discoursing as to the
   universal call of the Gentiles -- that the grace of God must be offered
   to all -- that Christ must enlighten the whole world by his gospel, in
   order that the impiety of men might be the more fully attested and
   demonstrated. This, therefore, was the delay, until the career of the
   gospel should be completed, because a gracious invitation to salvation
   was first in order. [656] Hence he adds, in his time, because vengeance
   was ripe after grace had been rejected. [657]

   7. The mystery of iniquity. This is opposed to revelation; for as Satan
   had not yet gathered so much strength, as that Antichrist could openly
   oppress the Church, he says that he is carrying on secretly and
   clandestinely [658] what he would do openly in his own time. He was
   therefore at that time secretly laying the foundations on which he
   would afterwards rear the edifice, as actually took place. And this
   tends to confirm more fully what I have already stated, that it is not
   one individual that is represented under the term Antichrist, but one
   kingdom, which extends itself through many ages. In the same sense,
   John says that Antichrist will come, but that there were already many
   in his time. (1 John 2:18.) For he admonishes those who were then
   living to be on their guard against that deadly pestilence, which was
   at that time shooting up in various forms. For sects were rising up
   which were the seeds, as it were, of that unhappy weed which has
   well-nigh choked and destroyed God's entire tillage. [659] But although
   Paul conveys the idea of a secret manner of working, yet he has made
   use of the term mystery rather than any other, alluding to the mystery
   of salvation, of which he speaks elsewhere, (Colossians 1:26,) for he
   carefully insists on the struggle of repugnancy between the Son of God
   and this son of perdition

   Only now withholding. While he makes both statements in reference to
   one person -- that he will hold supremacy for a time, and that he will
   shortly be taken out of the way, I have no doubt that he refers to
   Antichrist; and the participle withholding must be explained in the
   future tense. [660] For he has, in my opinion, added this for the
   consolation of believers -- that the reign of Antichrist will be
   temporary, the limits of it having been assigned to it by God; for
   believers might object -- "Of what avail is it that the gospel is
   preached, if Satan is now hatching a tyranny that he is to exercise for
   ever?" He accordingly exhorts to patience, because God afflicts his
   Church only for a time, that he may one day afford it deliverance; and,
   on the other hand, the perpetuity of Christ's reign must be considered,
   in order that believers may repose in it.

   8 And then will be revealed -- that is, when that impediment (to
   katechon) shall be removed; for he does not point out the time of
   revelation as being when he, who now holds the supremacy, will be taken
   out of the way, but he has an eye to what he had said before. For he
   had said that there was some hindrance in the way of Antichrist's
   entering upon an open possession of the kingdom. He afterwards added,
   that he was already hatching a secret work of impiety. In the third
   place, he has interspersed consolation, on the ground that this tyranny
   would come to an end. [661] He now again repeats, that he [662] who was
   as yet hidden, would be revealed in his time; and the repetition is
   with this view -- that believers, being furnished with spiritual armor,
   may, nevertheless, fight vigorously under Christ, [663] and not allow
   themselves to be overwhelmed, although the deluge of impiety should
   thus overspread. [664]

   Whom the Lord. He had foretold the destruction of Antichrist's reign;
   he now points out the manner of his destruction -- that he will be
   reduced to nothing by the word of the Lord. It is uncertain, however,
   whether he speaks of the last appearance of Christ, when he will be
   manifested from heaven as the Judge. The words, indeed, seem to have
   this meaning, but Paul does not mean that Christ would accomplish this
   [665] in one moment. Hence we must understand it in this sense -- that
   Antichrist would be wholly and in every respect destroyed, [666] when
   that final day of the restoration of all things shall arrive. Paul,
   however, intimates that Christ will in the mean time, by the rays which
   he will emit previously to his advent, put to flight the darkness in
   which Antichrist will reign, just as the sun, before he is seen by us,
   chases away the darkness of the night by the pouring forth of his rays.
   [667]

   This victory of the word, therefore, will shew itself in this world,
   for the spirit of his mouth simply means the word, as it also does in
   Isaiah 11:4, to which passage Paul seems to allude. For the Prophet
   there takes in the same sense the scepter of his mouth, and the breath
   of his lips, and he also furnishes Christ with these very arms, that he
   may rout his enemies. This is a signal commendation of true and sound
   doctrine -- that it is represented as sufficient for putting an end to
   all impiety, and as destined to be invariably victorious, in opposition
   to all the machinations of Satan; as also when, a little afterwards,
   the proclamation of it is spoken of as Christ's coming to us.

   When Paul adds, the brightness of his coming, he intimates that the
   light of Christ's presence will be such as will swallow up the darkness
   of Antichrist. In the mean time, he indirectly intimates, that
   Antichrist will be permitted to reign for a time, when Christ has, in a
   manner, withdrawn, as usually happens, whenever on his presenting
   himself we turn our back upon him. And, undoubtedly, that is a sad
   departure [668] of Christ, when he has taken away his light from men,
   which has been improperly and unworthily received, [669] in accordance
   with what follows. In the mean time Paul teaches, that by his presence
   alone all the elect of God will be abundantly safe, in opposition to
   all the subtleties of Satan.

   in omni potentia, et signis et prodigiis mendacibus,

   12. Ut iudicentur omnes qui non crediderunt veritati, sed oblectati

   9 Whose coming He confirms what he has said by an argument from
   contraries. For as Antichrist cannot stand otherwise than through the
   impostures of Satan, he must necessarily vanish as soon as Christ
   shines forth. In fine, as it is only in darkness that he reigns, the
   dawn of the day puts to flight and extinguishes the thick darkness of
   his reign. We are now in possession of Paul's design, for he meant to
   say, that Christ would have no difficulty in destroying the tyranny of
   Antichrist, which was supported by no resources but those of Satan. In
   the mean time, however, he points out the marks by which that wicked
   one may be distinguished. For after having spoken of the working or
   efficacy of Satan, he marks it out particularly when he says, in signs
   and lying wonders, and in all deceivableness. And assuredly, in order
   that this may be opposed to the kingdom of Christ, it must consist
   partly in false doctrine and errors, and partly in pretended miracles.
   For the kingdom of Christ consists of the doctrine of truth, and the
   power of the Spirit. Satan, accordingly, with the view of opposing
   Christ in the person of his Vicar, puts on Christ's mask, [670] while
   he, nevertheless, at the same time chooses armor, with which he may
   directly oppose Christ. Christ, by the doctrine of his gospel,
   enlightens our minds in eternal life; Antichrist, trained up under
   Satan's tuition, by wicked doctrine, involves the wicked in ruin; [671]
   Christ puts forth the power of his Spirit for salvation, and seals his
   gospel by miracles; the adversary, [672] by the efficacy of Satan,
   alienates us from the Holy Spirit, and by his enchantments confirms
   miserable men [673] in error.

   He gives the name of miracles of falsehood, not merely to such as are
   falsely and deceptively contrived by cunning men with a view to impose
   upon the simple -- a kind of deception with which all Papacy abounds,
   for they are a part of his power which he has previously touched upon;
   but takes falsehood as consisting in this, that Satan draws to a
   contrary end works which otherwise are truly works of God, and abuses
   miracles so as to obscure God's glory. [674] In the mean time, however,
   there can be no doubt, that he deceives by means of enchantments--an
   example of which we have in Pharaoh's magicians. (Exodus 7:11.)

   10 In those that perish. He limits the power of Satan, as not being
   able to injure the elect of God, just as Christ, also, exempts them
   from this danger. (Matthew 24:24.) From this it appears, that
   Antichrist has not so great power otherwise than by his permission.
   Now, this consolation was necessary. For all the pious, but for this,
   would of necessity be overpowered with fear, if they saw a yawning gulf
   pervading the whole path, along which they must pass. Hence Paul,
   however he may wish them to be in a state of anxiety, that they may be
   on their guard, lest by excessive carelessness they should fall back,
   nay, even throw themselves into ruin, does, nevertheless, bid them
   cherish good hope, inasmuch as Satan's power is bridled, that he may
   not be able to involve any but the wicked in ruin.

   Because they received not the love. Lest the wicked should complain
   that they perish innocently, [675] and that they have been appointed to
   death rather from cruelty on the part of God, than from any fault on
   their part, Paul shews on what good grounds it is that so severe
   vengeance from God is to come upon them -- because they have not
   received in the temper of mind with which they ought the truth which
   was presented to them, nay more, of their own accord refused salvation.
   And from this appears more clearly what I have already stated -- that
   the gospel required to be preached to the world before God would give
   Satan so much permission, for he would never have allowed his temple to
   be so basely profaned, [676] had he not been provoked by extreme
   ingratitude on the part of men. In short, Paul declares that Antichrist
   will be the minister of God's righteous vengeance against those who,
   being called to salvation, have rejected the gospel, and have preferred
   to apply their mind to impiety and errors. Hence there is no reason why
   Papists should now object, that it is at variance with the clemency of
   Christ to cast off his Church in this manner. For though the domination
   of Antichrist has been cruel, none have perished but those who were
   deserving of it, nay more, did of their own accord choose death.
   (Proverbs 8:36.) And unquestionably, while the voice of the Son of God
   has sounded forth everywhere, it finds the ears of men deaf, nay
   obstinate, [677] and while a profession of Christianity is common,
   there are, nevertheless, few that have truly and heartily given
   themselves to Christ. Hence it is not to be wondered, if similar
   vengeance quickly follows such a criminal [678] contempt.

   It is asked whether the punishment of blindness does not fall on any
   but those who have on set purpose rebelled against the gospel. I
   answer, that this special judgment by which God has avenged open
   contumacy, [679] does not stand in the way of his striking down with
   stupidity, [680] as often as seems good to him, those that have never
   heard a single word respecting Christ, for Paul does not discourse in a
   general way as to the reasons why God has from the beginning permitted
   Satan to go at large with his falsehoods, but as to what a horrible
   vengeance impends over gross despisers of new and previously unwonted
   grace. [681]

   He uses the expression -- receiving the love of the truth, to mean --
   applying the mind to the love of it. Hence we learn that faith is
   always conjoined with a sweet and voluntary reverence for God, because
   we do not properly believe the word of God, unless it is lovely and
   pleasant to us.

   11 The working of delusion. He means that errors will not merely have a
   place, but the wicked will be blinded, so that they will rush forward
   to ruin without consideration. For as God enlightens us inwardly by his
   Spirit, that his doctrine may be efficacious in us, and opens our eyes
   and hearts, that it may make its way thither, so by a righteous
   judgment he delivers over to a reprobate mind (Romans 1:28) those whom
   he has appointed to destruction, that with closed eyes and a senseless
   mind, they may, as if bewitched, deliver themselves over to Satan and
   his ministers to be deceived. And assuredly we have a notable specimen
   of this in the Papacy. No words can express how monstrous a sink of
   errors [682] there is there, how gross and shameful an absurdity of
   superstitions there is, and what delusions at variance with common
   sense. None that have even a moderate taste of sound doctrine, can
   think of such monstrous things without the greatest horror. How, then,
   could the whole world be lost in astonishment at them, were it not that
   men have been struck with blindness by the Lord, and converted, as it
   were, into stumps?

   12 That all may be condemned. That is, that they may receive the
   punishment due to their impiety. Thus, those that perish have no just
   ground to expostulate with God, inasmuch as they have obtained what
   they sought. For we must keep in view what is stated in Deuteronomy
   13:3, that the hearts of men are subjected to trial, when false
   doctrines come abroad, inasmuch as they have no power except among
   those who do not love God with a sincere heart. Let those, then, who
   take pleasure in unrighteousness, reap the fruit of it. When he says
   all, he means that contempt of God finds no excuse in the great crowd
   and multitude of those who refuse to obey the gospel, for God is the
   Judge of the whole world, so that he will inflict punishment upon a
   hundred thousand, no less than upon one individual.

   The participle eudokesantes (taking pleasure) means (so to speak) a
   voluntary inclination to evil, for in this way every excuse is cut off
   from the ungrateful, when they take so much pleasure in
   unrighteousness, as to prefer it to the righteousness of God. For by
   what violence will they say that they have been impelled to alienate
   themselves by a mad revolt [683] from God, towards whom they were led
   by the guidance of nature? It is at least manifest that they willingly
   and knowingly lent an ear to falsehoods.

   2 Thessalonians 2:13-14

   13. But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren
   beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to
   salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:

   13. Nos autem debemus gratias agere Deo semper de vobis, fratres
   dilecti a Domino, quia elegit vos Deus ab initio in salutem, in
   sanctificatione Spiritus, et fide veritatis:

   14. Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the
   glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

   14. Quo vocavit vos per evangelium nostrum, in possessionem gloriae
   (vel, gloriosam) Domini nostri Iesu Christi.


   13 But we are bound to give thanks. He now separates more openly the
   Thessalonians from the reprobate, that their faith may not waver from
   fear of the revolt that was to take place. At the same time, he had it
   in view to consult, not their welfare only, but also that of posterity.
   [684] And he does not merely confirm them that they may not fall over
   the same precipice with the world, but by this comparison he extols the
   more the grace of God towards them, in that, while they see almost the
   whole world hurried forward to death at the same time, as if by a
   violent tempest, they are, by the hand of God, maintained in a quiet
   and secure condition of life. [685] Thus we must contemplate the
   Judgments of God upon the reprobate in such a way that they may be, as
   it were, mirrors to us for considering his mercy towards us. For we
   must draw this conclusion, that it is owing solely to the singular
   grace of God that we do not miserably perish with them.

   He calls them beloved of the Lord, for this reason, that they may the
   better consider that the sole reason why they are exempted from the
   almost universal overthrow of the world, was because God exercised
   towards them unmerited love. Thus Moses admonished the Jews --

   "God did not elevate you so magnificently because ye were more powerful
   than others, or were numerous, but because he loved your fathers."
   (Deuteronomy 7:7-8.)

   For, when we hear the term love, that statement of John must
   immediately occur to our mind -- Not that we first loved him. (1 John
   4:19.) In short, Paul here does two things; for he confirms faith, lest
   the pious should give way from being overcome with fear, and he exhorts
   them to gratitude, that they may value so much the higher the mercy of
   God towards them.

   Hath chosen you. He states the reason why all are not involved and
   swallowed up in the same ruin -- because Satan has no power over any
   that God has chosen, so as to prevent them from being saved, though
   heaven and earth were to be confounded. This passage is read in various
   ways.

   The old interpreter has rendered it first-fruits, [686] as being in the
   Greek aparchen; but as almost all the Greek manuscripts have ap'
   archos, I have in preference followed this reading. Should any one
   prefer first-fruits, the meaning will be, that believers have been, as
   it were, set aside for a sacred offering, by a metaphor taken from the
   ancient custom of the law. Let us, however, hold by what is more
   generally received, that he says that the Thessalonians were chosen
   from the beginning

   Some understand the meaning to be, that they had been called among the
   first; but this is foreign to Paul's meaning, and does not accord with
   the connection of the passage. For he does not merely exempt from fear
   a few individuals, who had been led to Christ immediately on the
   commencement of the gospel, but this consolation belongs to all the
   elect of God, without exception. When, therefore, he says from the
   beginning, he means that there is no danger lest their salvation, which
   is founded on God's eternal election, should be overthrown, whatever
   tumultuous changes may occur. "However Satan may mix and confound all
   things in the world, your salvation, notwithstanding, has been placed
   on a footing of safety, prior to the creation of the world." Here,
   therefore, is the true port of safety, that God, who elected us of old,
   [687] will deliver us from all the evils that threaten us. For we are
   elected to salvation; we shall, therefore, be safe from destruction.
   But as it is not for us to penetrate into God's secret counsel, to seek
   there assurance of our salvation, he specifies signs or tokens of
   election, which should suffice us for the assurance of it.

   In sanctification of the spirit, says he, and belief of the truth. This
   may be explained in two ways, with sanctification, or by
   sanctification. It is not of much importance which of the two you
   select, as it is certain [688] that Paul meant simply to introduce, in
   connection with election, those nearer tokens which manifest to us what
   is in its own nature incomprehensible, and are conjoined with it by an
   indissoluble tie. Hence, in order that we may know that we are elected
   by God, there is no occasion to inquire as to what he decreed before
   the creation of the world, but we find in ourselves a satisfactory
   proof if he has sanctified us by his Spirit, -- if he has enlightened
   us in the faith of his gospel. For the gospel is an evidence to us of
   our adoption, and the Spirit seals it, and those that are led by the
   Spirit are the sons of God, (Romans 8:14,) and he who by faith
   possesses Christ has everlasting life. (1 John 5:12.) These things must
   be carefully observed, lest, overlooking the revelation of God's will,
   with which he bids us rest satisfied, we should plunge into a profound
   labyrinth from a desire to take it from his secret counsel, from the
   investigation of which he draws us aside. Hence it becomes us to rest
   satisfied with the faith of the gospel, and that grace of the Spirit by
   which we have been regenerated. And by this means is refuted the
   wickedness [689] of those who make the election of God a pretext for
   every kind of iniquity, while Paul connects it with faith and
   regeneration in such a manner, that he would not have it judged of by
   us on any other grounds.

   14 To which he called us. He repeats the same thing, though in somewhat
   different terms. For the sons of God are not called otherwise than to
   the belief of the truth. Paul, however, meant to shew here how
   competent a witness he is for confirming that thing of which he was a
   minister. He accordingly puts himself forward as a surety, that the
   Thessalonians may not doubt that the gospel, in which they had been
   instructed by him, is the safety-bringing voice of God, by which they
   are aroused from death, and are delivered from the tyranny of Satan. He
   calls it his gospel, not as though it had originated with him, [690]
   but inasmuch as the preaching of it had been committed to him.

   What he adds, to the acquisition or possession of the glory of Christ,
   may be taken either in an active or in a passive signification --
   either as meaning, that they are called in order that they may one day
   possess a glory in common with Christ, or that Christ acquired them
   with a view to his glory. And thus it will be a second means of
   confirmation that he will defend them, as being nothing less than his
   own inheritance, and, in maintaining their salvation, will stand
   forward in defense of his own glory; which latter meaning, in my
   opinion, suits better.

   2 Thessalonians 2:15-17

   15. Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye
   have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.

   15. Itaque fratres, state, et tenete institutiones, quas didicistis vel
   per sermonem, vel per epistolam nostram.

   16. Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which
   hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope
   through grace,

   16. Ipse vero Dominus noster Iesus Christus, et Deus, ac Pater noster,
   qui dilexcit nos, et dedit consolationem aeternam, et spem bonam per
   gratiam,

   17. Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work.

   17. Consoletur corda vestra, et stabiliat vos in omni opere et sermone
   bono.


   He deduces this exhortation on good grounds from what goes before,
   inasmuch as our steadfastness and power of perseverance rest on nothing
   else than assurance of divine grace. When, however, God calls us to
   salvation, stretching forth, as it were, his hand to us; when Christ,
   by the doctrine of the gospel, presents himself to us to be enjoyed;
   when the Spirit is given us as a seal and earnest of eternal life,
   though the heaven should fall, we must, nevertheless, not become
   disheartened. Paul, accordingly, would have the Thessalonians stand,
   not merely when others continue to stand, but with a more settled
   stability; so that, on seeing almost all turning aside from the faith,
   and all things full of confusion, they will, nevertheless, retain their
   footing. And assuredly the calling of God ought to fortify us against
   all occasions of offense in such a manner, that not even the entire
   ruin of the world shall shake, much less overthrow, our stability.

   15 Hold fast the institutions. Some restrict this to precepts of
   external polity; but this does not please me, for he points out the
   manner of standing firm. Now, to be furnished with invincible strength
   is a much higher thing than external discipline. Hence, in my opinion,
   he includes all doctrine under this term, as though he had said that
   they have ground on which they may stand firm, provided they persevere
   in sound doctrine, according as they had been instructed by him. I do
   not deny that the term paradoseis is fitly applied to the ordinances
   which are appointed by the Churches, with a view to the promoting of
   peace and the maintaining of order, and I admit that it is taken in
   this sense when human traditions are treated of, (Matthew 15:6.) Paul,
   however, will be found in the next chapter making use of the term
   tradition, as meaning the rule that he had laid down, and the very
   signification of the term is general. The context, however, as I have
   said, requires that it be taken here to mean the whole of that doctrine
   in which they had been instructed. For the matter treated of is the
   most important of all -- that their faith may remain secure in the
   midst of a dreadful agitation of the Church.

   Papists, however, act a foolish part in gathering from this that their
   traditions ought to be observed. They reason, indeed, in this manner --
   that if it was allowable for Paul to enjoin traditions, it was
   allowable also for other teachers; and that, if it was a pious thing
   [691] to observe the former, the latter also ought not less to be
   observed. Granting them, however, that Paul speaks of precepts
   belonging to the external government of the Church, I say that they
   were, nevertheless, not contrived by him, but divinely communicated.
   For he declares elsewhere, (1 Corinthians 7:35,) that it was not his
   intention to ensnare consciences, as it was not lawful, either for
   himself, or for all the Apostles together. They act a still more
   ridiculous part in making it their aim to pass off, under this, the
   abominable sink of their own superstitions, as though they were the
   traditions of Paul. But farewell to these trifles, when we are in
   possession of Paul's true meaning. And we may judge in part from this
   Epistle what traditions he here recommends, for he says -- whether by
   word, that is, discourse, or by epistle. Now, what do these Epistles
   contain but pure doctrine, which overturns to the very foundation the
   whole of the Papacy, and every invention that is at variance with the
   simplicity of the Gospel?

   16 Now the Lord himself. When he ascribes to Christ a work altogether
   Divine, and represents him, in common with the Father, as the Author of
   the choicest blessings, as we have in this a clear proof of the
   divinity of Christ, so we are admonished, that we cannot obtain
   anything from God unless we seek it in Christ himself: and when he asks
   that God may give him those things which he had enjoined, he shews
   clearly enough how little influence exhortations have, unless God
   inwardly move and affect our hearts. Unquestionably there will be but
   an empty sound striking upon the ear, if doctrine does not receive
   efficacy from the Spirit.

   What he afterwards adds, who hath loved you, and hath given
   consolation, etc., relates to confidence in asking; for he would have
   the Thessalonians feel persuaded that God will do what he prays for.
   And from what does he prove this? Because he once shewed that they were
   dear to him, while he has already conferred upon them distinguished
   favors, and in this manner has bound himself to them for the time to
   come. This is what he means by everlasting consolation. The term hope,
   also, has the same object in view -- that they may confidently expect a
   never-failing continuance of gifts. But what does he ask? That God may
   sustain their hearts by his consolation; for this is his office, to
   keep them from giving way through anxiety or distrust; and farther,
   that he may give them perseverance, both in a pious and holy course of
   life, and in sound doctrine; for I am of opinion, that it is rather of
   this than of common discourse that he speaks, so that this agrees with
   what goes before.

   CHAPTER 3
     __________________________________________________________________

   2 Thessalonians 3:1-5

   1. Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have
   free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:

   1. Quod reliquum est, orate fratres pro nobis: ut sermo Domini currat
   et glorificetur, quemadmodum et apud vos;

   2. And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for
   all men have not faith.

   2. Et ut liberemur ab importunis et malignis hominibus: non enim omnium
   est fides.

   3. But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from
   evil.

   3. Fidelis autem Dominus, qui confirmabit vos, et custodiet a maligno.

   4. And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and
   will do the things which we command you.

   4. Confidimus autem in Domino de vobis, quod quae vobis praecipimus, et
   facitis, et facturi estis.

   5. And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the
   patient waiting for Christ.

   5. Dominus autem dirigat corda vestra in dilectionem Dei, et
   exspectationem Christi.


   1 Pray for us. Though the Lord powerfully aided him, and though he
   surpassed all others in earnestness of prayer, he nevertheless does not
   despise the prayers of believers, by which the Lord would have us
   aided. It becomes us, after his example, eagerly to desire this aid,
   and to stir up our brethren to pray for us.

   When, however, he adds -- that the word of God may have its course, he
   shows that he has not so much concern and regard for himself
   personally, as for the entire Church. For why does he desire to be
   recommended to the prayers of the Thessalonians? That the doctrine of
   the gospel may have its course. He does not desire, therefore, so much
   that regard should be had to himself individually, as to the glory of
   God and the common welfare of the Church. Course means here
   dissemination; [692] glory means something farther, -- that his
   preaching may have its power and efficacy for renewing men after the
   image of God. Hence, holiness of life and uprightness on the part of
   Christians is the glory of the gospel; as, on the other hand, those
   defame the gospel who make profession of it with the mouth, while in
   the meantime they live in wickedness and baseness. He says -- as among
   you; for this should be a stimulus to the pious, to see all others like
   them. Hence those that have already entered into the kingdom of God are
   exhorted to pray daily that it may come. (Matthew 6:10.)

   2 That we may be delivered. The old interpreter has rendered it, not
   unhappily, in my opinion -- unreasonable [693] Now, by this term, as
   also by that which immediately follows, (ton poneron,) evil, Paul means
   wicked and treacherous men, who lurked in the Church, under the name of
   Christians, or at least Jews, who with a mad zeal for the law furiously
   persecuted the gospel. He knew, however, how much danger impended over
   them from both these classes. Chrysostom, however, thinks that those
   only are meant who maliciously oppose the gospel by base doctrines,
   [694] -- not by weapons of violence, as for example, Alexander,
   Hymeneus, and the like; but for my part, I extend it generally to all
   kinds of dangers and enemies. He was at that time proceeding towards
   Jerusalem, and wrote in the midst of his journeyings. Now, he had
   already been divinely forewarned that imprisonments and persecutions
   awaited him there. (Acts 20:23.) He means, however, deliverance, so
   that he may come off victorious, whether by life or by death.

   All have not faith. This might be explained to mean, "Faith is not in
   all." This expression, however, were both ambiguous and more obscure.
   Let us therefore retain Paul's words, by which he intimates that faith
   is a gift of God that is too rare to be found in all. God, therefore,
   calls many who do not come to him by faith. Many pretend to come to
   him, who have their heart at the farthest distance from him. Farther,
   he does not speak of all indiscriminately, but merely animadverts upon
   those that belong to the Church: for the Thessalonians saw that very
   many held faith in abhorrence; [695] nay, they saw how small was the
   number of believers. Hence it would have been unnecessary to say this
   as to strangers; but Paul simply says that all that make a profession
   of faith are not such in reality. Should you take in all Jews, they
   appeared to have nearness to Christ, for they ought to have recognized
   him by means of the law and the prophets. Paul, there can be no
   question specially marks out those with whom he would have to do. Now,
   it is probable that they were those who, while they had the appearance
   and honorary title of piety, were nevertheless very far from the
   reality. From this came the conflict.

   With the view of shewing, therefore, that it was not groundlessly, or
   without good reason, that he dreaded contests with wicked and perverse
   men, he says that faith is not common to all, because the wicked and
   reprobate are always mixed with the good, as tares are with the good
   wheat. (Matthew 13:25.) And this ought to be remembered by us whenever
   we have annoyance given us by wicked persons, who nevertheless desire
   to be reckoned as belonging to the society of Christians -- that all
   men have not faith. Nay more, when we hear in some instances that the
   Church is disturbed by base factions, let this be a shield to us
   against offenses of this nature; for we shall not merely inflict injury
   upon pious teachers, if we have doubts as to their fidelity, whenever
   domestic enemies do them harm, but our faith will from time to time
   waver, unless we keep in mind that among those who boast of the name of
   Christians there are many that are treacherous. [696]

   3 But God is faithful. As it was possible that their minds, influenced
   by unfavorable reports, might come to entertain some doubts as to
   Paul's ministry, having taught them that faith is not always found in
   men, he now calls them back to God, and says that he is faithful, so as
   to confirm them against all contrivances of men, by which they will
   endeavor to shake them. "They, indeed, are treacherous, but there is in
   God a support that is abundantly secure, so as to keep you from giving
   way." He calls the Lord faithful, inasmuch as he adheres to his purpose
   to the end in maintaining the salvation of his people, seasonably aids
   them, and never forsakes them in dangers, as in 1 Corinthians 10:13,

   God is faithful, who will not suffer
   you to be tried above that ye are able to bear.

   These words, however, themselves shew that Paul was more anxious as to
   others than as to himself. Malicious men directed against him the
   stings of their malignity; the whole violence [697] of it fell upon
   him. In the mean time, he directs all his anxieties towards the
   Thessalonians, lest this temptation should do them any injury.

   The term evil may refer as well to the thing, that is, malice, as to
   the persons of the wicked. I prefer, however, to interpret it of Satan,
   the head of all the wicked. For it were a small thing to be delivered
   from the cunning or violence of men, if the Lord did not protect us
   from all spiritual injury.

   4 We have confidence. By this preface he prepares the way for
   proceeding to give the instruction, which we shall find him immediately
   afterwards subjoining. For the confidence which he says he has
   respecting them, made them much more ready to obey than if he had
   required obedience from them in a way of doubt or distrust. He says,
   however, that this hope, which he cherished in reference to them, was
   founded upon the Lord, inasmuch as it is his to bind their hearts to
   obedience, and to keep them in it; or by this expression, (as appears
   to me more probable,) he meant to testify, that it is not his intention
   to enjoin anything but by the commandment of the Lord. Here,
   accordingly, he marks out limits for himself as to enjoining, and for
   them as to obeying -- that it should be only in the Lord. [698] All,
   therefore, that do not observe this limitation, do to no purpose resort
   to Paul's example, with the view of binding the Church and subjecting
   it to their laws. Perhaps he had this also in view, that the respect
   which was due to his Apostleship might remain unimpaired among the
   Thessalonians, however the wicked might attempt to deprive him of the
   honor that belonged to him; for the prayer which he immediately
   subjoins tends towards this object. For provided men's hearts continue
   to be directed towards love to God, and patient waiting for Christ,
   other things will be in a desirable state, and Paul declares that he
   desires nothing else. From this it is manifest, how very far he is from
   seeking dominion for himself peculiarly. For he is satisfied provided
   they persevere in love to God, and in the hope of Christ's coming. In
   following up with prayer his expression of confidence, [699] he
   admonishes us that we must not relax in eagerness of prayer on the
   ground that we cherish good hope.

   As, however, he states here in a summary manner the things that he knew
   to be most necessary for Christians, let every one make it his endeavor
   to make proficiency in these two things, in so far as he desires to
   make progress towards perfection. And, unquestionably, the love of God
   cannot reign in us unless brotherly love is also exercised. Waiting for
   Christ, on the other hand, teaches us to exercise contempt of the
   world, mortification of the flesh, and endurance of the cross. At the
   same time the expression might be explained as meaning, the patience of
   Christ -- that which Christ's doctrine begets in us; but I prefer to
   understand it as referring to the hope of ultimate redemption. For this
   is the only thing that sustains us in the warfare of the present life,
   that we wait for the Redeemer; and farther, this waiting requires
   patient endurance amidst the continual exercises of the cross.

   2 Thessalonians 3:6-10

   6. Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
   that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly,
   and not after the tradition which he received of us.

   6. Praecipimus autem vobis, fratres in nomine Domini nostri Iesu
   Christi, ut vos subducatis ab omni fratre, qui inordinate ambulet, et
   non iuxta institutionem, quam accepit a nobis.

   7. For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not
   ourselves disorderly among you;

   7. Ipsi enim scitis, quomodo oporteat nos imitari, quia non inordinate
   egimus inter vos:

   8. Neither did we eat any man's bread for nought; but wrought with
   labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to
   any of you:

   8. Neque gratis panem comedimus a quoquam, sed cum labore et sudore
   nocte dieque facientes opus, ne cui vestrum graves essemus.

   9. Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample
   unto you to follow us.

   9. Non quod non habeamus potestatem, sed ut nos ipsos exemplar
   proponeremus vobis ad imitandum vos.

   10. For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any
   would not work, neither should he eat.

   10. Etenim quum essemus apud vos, hoc vobis praecepimus, ut, qui
   laborare non vult, is neque comedat.


   He now proceeds to the correcting of a particular fault. As there were
   some indolent, and at the same time curious and prattling persons, who,
   in order that they might scrape together a living at the expense of
   others, wandered about from house to house, he forbids that their
   indolence should be encouraged by indulgence, [700] and teaches that
   those live holily who procure for themselves the necessaries of life by
   honorable and useful labor. And in the first place, he applies the
   appellation of disorderly persons, not to those that are of a dissolute
   life, or to those whose characters are stained by flagrant crimes, but
   to indolent and worthless persons, who employ themselves in no
   honorable and useful occupation. For this truly is ataxia, (disorder,
   [701] ) -- not considering for what purpose we were made, and
   regulating our life with a view to that end, while it is only when we
   live according to the rule prescribed to us by God that this life is
   duly regulated. Let this order be set aside, and there is nothing but
   confusion in human life. This, also, is worthy to be noticed, lest any
   one should take pleasure in exercising himself apart from a legitimate
   call from God: for God has distinguished in such a manner the life of
   men, in order that every one may lay himself out for the advantage of
   others. He, therefore, who lives to himself alone, so as to be
   profitable in no way to the human race, nay more, is a burden to
   others, giving help to no one, is on good grounds reckoned to be
   ataktos, (disorderly.) Hence Paul declares that such persons must be
   put away from the society of believers, that they may not bring
   dishonor upon the Church.

   6 Now we command you in the name. Erasmus renders it -- "by the name,"
   as if it were an adjuration. While I do not altogether reject this
   rendering, I, at the same time, am rather of opinion that the particle
   in is redundant, as in very many other passages, and that in accordance
   with the Hebrew idiom. Thus the meaning will be, that this commandment
   ought to be received with reverence, not as from a mortal man, but as
   from Christ himself; and Chrysostom explains it in this manner. This
   withdrawment, [702] however of which he speaks, relates -- not to
   public excommunication but to private intercourse. For he simply
   forbids believers to have any familiar intercourse with drones of this
   sort, who have no honorable means of life, in which they may exercise
   themselves. He says, however, expressly -- from every brother, because
   if they profess themselves to be Christians they are above all others
   intolerable, inasmuch as they are, in a manner, the pests and stains of
   religion.

   Not according to the injunction -- namely, that which we shall find him
   shortly afterwards adding -- that food should not be given to the man
   that refuses to labor. Before coming to this, however, he states what
   example he has given them in his own person. For doctrine obtains much
   more of credit and authority, when we impose upon others no other
   burden than we take upon ourselves. Now he mentions that he himself was
   engaged in working with his hands night and day, that he might not
   burden any one with expense. He had, also, touched somewhat on this
   point in the preceding Epistle -- to which my readers must have
   recourse [703] for a fuller explanation of this point.

   As to his saying, that he had not eaten any one's bread for naught, he
   assuredly would not have done this, though he had not labored with his
   hands. For that which is due in the way of right, is not a thing that
   is gratuitous, and the price of the labor which teachers [704] lay out
   in behalf of the Church, is much greater than the food which they
   receive from it. But Paul had here in his eye inconsiderate persons,
   for all have not so much equity and judgment as to consider what
   remuneration is due to the ministers of the word. Nay more, such is the
   niggardliness of some, that, though they contribute nothing of their
   own, they, envy them their living, as if they were idle men. [705] He,
   also, immediately afterwards declares that he waived his right, when he
   refrained from taking any remuneration, by which he intimates, that it
   is much less to be endured, that those, who do nothing, shall live on
   what belongs to others. [706] When he says, that they know how they
   ought to imitate, he does not simply mean that his example should be
   regarded by them as a law, but the meaning is, that they knew what they
   had seen in him that was worthy of imitation, nay more, that the very
   thing of which he is at present speaking, has been set before them for
   imitation.

   9 Not because we have not. As Paul wished by his laboring to set an
   example, that idle persons might not like drones [707] eat the bread of
   others, so he was not willing that this very thing [708] should do
   injury to the ministers of the word, so that the Churches should
   defraud them of their proper livelihood. In this we may see his
   singular moderation and humanity, and how far removed he was from the
   ambition of those who abuse their powers, so as to infringe upon the
   rights of their brethren. There was a danger, lest the Thessalonians,
   having had from the beginning the preaching of the gospel from Paul's
   mouth gratuitously, [709] should lay it down as a law for the future as
   to other ministers; the disposition of mankind being so niggardly.
   Paul, accordingly, anticipates this danger, and teaches that he had a
   right to more than he had made use of, that others may retain their
   liberty unimpaired. He designed by this means to inflict the greater
   disgrace, as I have already noticed above, on those that do nothing,
   for it is an argument from, the greater to the less.

   10 He that will not labor. From its being written in Psalm 128:2 --

   Thou art blessed, eating of the labor of thy hands,

   also in Proverbs 10:4,

   The blessing of the Lord is upon the hands of him that laboreth,

   it is certain that indolence and idleness are accursed of God. Besides,
   we know that man was created with this view, that he might do
   something. Not only does Scripture testify this to us, but nature
   itself taught it to the heathen. Hence it is reasonable, that those,
   who wish to exempt themselves from the common law, [710] should also be
   deprived of food, the reward of labor. When, however, the Apostle
   commanded that such persons should not eat, he does not mean that he
   gave commandment to those persons, but forbade that the Thessalonians
   should encourage their indolence by supplying them with food.

   It is also to be observed, that there are different ways of laboring.
   For whoever aids [711] the society of men by his industry, either by
   ruling his family, or by administering public or private affairs, or by
   counseling, or by teaching, [712] or in any other way, is not to be
   reckoned among the idle. For Paul censures those lazy drones who lived
   by the sweat of others, while they contribute no service in common for
   aiding the human race. Of this sort are our monks and priests who are
   largely pampered by doing nothing, excepting that they chant in the
   temples, for the sake of preventing weariness. This truly is, (as
   Plautus speaks,) [713] to "live musically." [714]

   2 Thessalonians 3:11-13

   11. For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly,
   working not at all, but are busybodies.

   11. Audimus enim quosdam versantes inter vos inordinate nihil operis
   agentes, sed curiose satagentes.

   12. Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus
   Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.

   12. Talibus autem praecipimus, et obsecramus [715] per Dominum nos trum
   Iesum Christum, ut cum quiete operantes suum ipsorum panem edant.

   13. But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.

   13. Vos autem fratres, ne defatigemini benefaciendo.


   11 We hear that there are some among you. It is probable that this kind
   of drones were, as it were, the seed of idle monkhood. For, from the
   very beginning, there were some who, under pretext of religion, either
   made free with the tables of others, or craftily drew to themselves the
   substance of the simple. They had also, even in the time of Augustine,
   come to prevail so much, that he was constrained to write a book
   expressly against idle monks, where he complains with good reason of
   their pride, because, despising the admonition of the Apostle, they not
   only excuse themselves on the ground of infirmity, but they wish to
   appear holier than all others, on the ground that they are exempt from
   labors. He inveighs, with good reason, against this unseemliness, that,
   while the senators are laborious, the workman, or person in humble
   life, does not merely live in idleness, [716] but would fain have his
   indolence pass for sanctity. Such are his views. [717] In the mean
   time, however, the evil has increased to such an extent, that idle
   bellies occupy nearly the tenth part of the world, whose only religion
   is to be well stuffed, and to have exemption from all annoyance [718]
   of labor. And this manner of life they dignify, sometimes with the name
   of the Order, sometimes with that of the Rule, of this or that
   personage. [719]

   But what does the Spirit say, on the other hand, by the mouth of Paul?
   He pronounces them all to be irregular and disorderly, by whatever name
   of distinction they may be dignified. It is not necessary to relate
   here how much the idle life of monks has invariably displeased persons
   of sounder judgment. That is a memorable saying of an old monk, which
   is recorded by Socrates in the Eighth Book of the Tripartite History --
   that he who does not labor with his hands is like a plunderer. [720] I
   do not mention other instances, nor is it necessary. Let this statement
   of the Apostle suffice us, in which he declares that they are
   dissolute, and in a manner lawless.

   Doing nothing. In the Greek participles there is, an elegant
   (prosonomasia) play upon words, which I have attempted in some manner
   to imitate, by rendering it as meaning that they do nothing, but have
   enough to do in the way of curiosity. [721] He censures, however, a
   fault with which idle persons are, for the most part, chargeable, that,
   by unseasonably bustling about, they give trouble to themselves and to
   others. For we see, that those who have nothing to do are much more
   fatigued by doing nothing, than if they were employing themselves in
   some very important work; they run hither and thither; wherever they
   go, they have the appearance of great fatigue; they gather all sorts of
   reports, and they put them in a confused way into circulation. You
   would say that they bore the weight of a kingdom upon their shoulders.
   Could there be a more remarkable exemplification of this than there is
   in the monks? For what class of men have less repose? Where does
   curiosity reign more extensively? Now, as this disease has a ruinous
   effect upon the public, Paul admonishes that it ought not to be
   encouraged by idleness.

   12 Now we command such. He corrects both of the faults of which he had
   made mention -- a blustering restlessness, and retirement from useful
   employment. He accordingly exhorts them, in the first place, to
   cultivate repose -- that is, to keep themselves quietly within the
   limits of their calling, or, as we commonly say, "sans faire bruit,"
   (without making a noise.) For the truth is this: those are the most
   peaceable of all, that exercise themselves in lawful employments; [722]
   while those that have nothing to do give trouble both to themselves and
   to others. Further, he subjoins another precept -- that they should
   labor, that is, that they should be intent upon their calling, and
   devote themselves to lawful and honorable employments, without which
   the life of man is of a wandering nature. Hence, also, there follows
   this third injunction -- that they should eat their own bread; by which
   he means, that they should be satisfied with what belongs to them, that
   they may not be oppressive or unreasonable to others.

   Drink water, says Solomon, from thine own fountains, and let the
   streams flow down to neighbors. (Proverbs 5:15.)

   This is the first law of equity, that no one make use of what belongs
   to another, but only use what he can properly call his own. The second
   is, that no one swallow up, like some abyss, what belongs to him, but
   that he be beneficent to neighbors, and that he may relieve their
   indigence by his abundance. [723] In the same manner, the Apostle
   exhorts those who had been formerly idle to labor, not merely that they
   may gain for themselves a livelihood, but that they may also be helpful
   to the necessities of their brethren, as he also teaches elsewhere.
   (Ephesians 4:28.)

   13 And you, brethren. Ambrose is of opinion that this is added lest the
   rich should, in a niggardly spirit, refuse to lend their aid to the
   poor, because he had exhorted them to eat every one his own bread. And,
   unquestionably, we see how many are unbefittingly ingenious in catching
   at a pretext for inhumanity. [724] Chrysostom explains it thus -- that
   indolent persons, however justly they may be condemned, must
   nevertheless be assisted when in want. I am simply of opinion, that
   Paul had it in view to provide against an occasion of offense, which
   might arise from the indolence of a few. For it usually happens, that
   those that are otherwise particularly ready and on the alert for
   beneficence, become cool on seeing that they have thrown away their
   favors by misdirecting them. Hence Paul admonishes us, that, although
   there are many that are undeserving, [725] while others abuse our
   liberality, we must not on this account leave off helping those that
   need our aid. Here we have a statement worthy of being observed -- that
   however ingratitude, moroseness, pride, arrogance, and other unseemly
   dispositions on the part of the poor, may have a tendency to annoy us,
   or to dispirit us, from a feeling of weariness, we must strive,
   nevertheless, never to leave off aiming at doing good.

   The second epistle to the Thessalonians was written from Athens.

   Ad Thessalonicenses secunda missa fuit ex Athenis.


   14 If any one obeys not. He has already declared previously, that he
   commands nothing but from the Lord. Hence the man, that would not obey,
   would not be contumacious against a mere man, but would be rebellious
   against God himself; [727] and accordingly he teaches that such persons
   ought to be severely chastised. And, in the first place, he desires
   that they be reported to him, that he may repress them by his
   authority; and, secondly, he orders them to be excommunicated, that,
   being touched with shame, they may repent. From this we infer, that we
   must not spare the reputation of those who cannot be arrested otherwise
   than by their faults being exposed; but we must take care to make known
   their distempers to the physician, that he may make it his endeavor to
   cure them.

   Keep no company. I have no doubt that he refers to excommunication;
   for, besides that the (ataxia) disorder to which he had adverted
   deserved a severe chastisement, contumacy is an intolerable vice. He
   had said before, Withdraw yourselves from them, for they live in a
   disorderly manner, (2 Thessalonians 3:6.) And now he says, Keep no
   company, for they reject my admonition. He expresses, therefore,
   something more by this second manner of expression than by the former;
   for it is one thing to withdraw from intimate acquaintance with an
   individual, and quite another to keep altogether aloof from his
   society. In short, those that do not obey after being admonished, he
   excludes from the common society of believers. By this we are taught
   that we must employ the discipline of excommunication against all the
   obstinate [728] persons who will not otherwise allow themselves to be
   brought under subjection, and must be branded with disgrace, until,
   having been brought under and subdued, they learn to obey.

   That he may be ashamed. There are, it is true, other ends to be served
   by excommunication -- that contagion may spread no farther, that the
   personal wickedness of one individual may not tend to the common
   disgrace of the Church, and that the example of severity may induce
   others to fear, (1 Timothy 5:20;) but Paul touches upon this one merely
   -- that those who have sinned may by shame be constrained to
   repentance. For those that please themselves in their vices become more
   and more obstinate: thus sin is nourished by indulgence and
   dissimulation. This, therefore, is the best remedy -- when a feeling of
   shame is awakened in the mind of the offender, so that he begins to be
   displeased with himself. It would, indeed, be a small point gained to
   have individuals made ashamed; but Paul had an eye to farther progress
   -- when the offender, confounded by a discovery of his own baseness, is
   led in this way to a full amendment: for shame, like sorrow, is a
   useful preparation for hatred of sin. Hence all that become wanton
   [729] must, as I have said, be restrained by this bridle, lest their
   audacity should be increased in consequence of impunity.

   15 Regard him not as an enemy. He immediately adds a softening of his
   rigor; for, as he elsewhere commands, we must take care that the
   offender be not swallowed up with sorrow, (2 Corinthians 2:7,) which
   would take place if severity were excessive. Hence we see that the use
   of discipline ought to be in such a way as to consult the welfare of
   those on whom the Church inflicts punishment. Now, it cannot but be
   that severity will fret, [730] when it goes beyond due bounds. Hence,
   if we wish to do good, gentleness and mildness are necessary, that
   those that are reproved may know that they are nevertheless loved. In
   short, excommunication does not tend to drive men from the Lord's
   flock, but rather to bring them back when wandering and going astray.

   We must observe, however, by what sign he would have brotherly love
   shewn -- not by allurements or flattery, but by admonitions; for in
   this way it will be, that all that will not be incurable will feel that
   concern is felt for their welfare. In the mean time, excommunication is
   distinguished from anathema: for as to those that the Church marks out
   by the severity of its censure, Paul admonishes that they should not be
   utterly cast away, as if they were cut off from all hope of salvation;
   but endeavors must be used, that they may be brought back to a sound
   mind.

   16 Now the Lord of peace. This prayer seems to be connected with the
   preceding sentence, with the view of recommending endeavors after
   concord and mildness. He had forbidden them to treat even the
   contumacious [731] as enemies, but rather with a view to their being
   brought back to a sound mind [732] by brotherly admonitions. He could
   appropriately, after this, subjoin an injunction as to the cultivation
   of peace; but as this is a work that is truly Divine, he betakes
   himself to prayer, which, nevertheless, has also the force of a
   precept. At the same time, he may also have another thing in view --
   that God may restrain unruly persons, [733] that they may not disturb
   the peace of the Church.

   17 The salutation, with my own hand. Here again he provides against the
   danger, of which he had previously made mention -- lest epistles
   falsely ascribed to him should find their way into the Churches. For
   this was an old artifice of Satan -- to put forward spurious writings,
   that he might detract from the credit of those that are genuine; and
   farther, under pretended designations of the Apostles, to disseminate
   wicked errors with the view of corrupting sound doctrine. By a singular
   kindness on the part of God, it has been brought about that, his frauds
   being defeated, the doctrine of Christ has come down to us sound and
   entire through the ministry of Paul and others. The concluding prayer
   explains in what manner God aids his believing people -- by the
   presence of Christ's grace.
