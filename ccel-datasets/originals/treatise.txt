  CHAPTER I

   That he who intends to become a Spiritual Man must first use much
   Bodily Exercise in Penance, and in Destroying of sin

   DEAR BROTHER IN CHRIST, --There be in the holy Church two kinds of
   life, by the which Christian souls do serve and please God, and procure
   their own salvation. The one is corporal, the other spiritual.

   Corporal working appertaineth principally to the men and women of the
   world, who for the nature of their estate do lawfully use worldly
   goods, and intermeddle and deal with worldly businesses and affairs.
   This life also belongeth to all young beginners in spirituality who be
   but newly converted from sensual and worldly sins to the service of
   God; and this life is to dispose and enable such persons for spiritual
   working, by taming the body by corporal works and exercises, and
   thereby bringing it into obedience and subjection to the spirit,
   whereby it may become supple and ready, and not much contrarious to the
   spirit in her spiritual exercisings; for as St Paul saith, that woman
   was made for man, and not man for woman. Even so corporal working was
   ordained for spiritual, and not spiritual working for corporal.
   Corporal working is to go before, and spiritual working cometh after,
   as the same St Paul saith in these words: That is not first which is
   spiritual, but that which is sensible (or corporal), afterwards cometh
   that which is spiritual. And the reason why it should be so is this,
   that we are born in sin and in corruption of the flesh, by the which we
   are in souls so blinded and so overlaid that we neither have the
   spiritual sight or knowing of God by light of understanding, nor the
   spiritual tasting or feeling of Him by a clean desire of loving; and
   therefore we cannot suddenly start out of the dark night of this
   fleshly corruption into the spiritual light; for we are not as yet able
   to endure such spiritual light, by reason of the sickness of our souls,
   any more than we can with our bodily eyes, when they are sore, behold
   and look upon the light of the sun; and for that cause we must expect
   and work by degrees and process of time. First, by corporal works
   diligently, till we be discharged, or much lightened, or eased from
   this heavy burden of sin and sensuality, that hindereth us from
   spiritual working; and till our souls be somewhat cleansed from great
   outward sins, and enabled for spiritual workings.

   By the corporal working that I speak of, thou must understand that I
   mean all manner of good works or deeds that thy soul doth by the senses
   or the members of thy body, either upon or towards thyself, as in
   fasting, watching, or in restraining thy fleshly or sensual desires, by
   penance-doing, or other acts of mortification. Or upon, or towards thy
   Christian brother, in performance of the works of mercy, spiritual or
   corporal. Or to, or towards God Himself, by suffering (for the love of
   Him and His justice) all manner of bodily pains and afflictions that
   shall occur for thee to undergo, either as immediately from His own
   hands, or by the means and from the hands of other creatures of His.
   All these kind of works done in faith and out of charity (without which
   they are of no worth) do please God. Therefore whoso desireth to become
   a spiritual man, it will be securest and profitable for him that he be
   first, for a long time, well exercised in these corporal workings, for
   these corporal deeds are practices and tokens of moral virtues, without
   which a soul is not able to work spiritually. Break down first pride
   within thee by bodily sufferings and bearings, and also by thinking in
   thy mind of something that will help to humble thee; and, moreover, by
   eschewing and avoiding all ostentations, boastings, or praising of
   thyself, either privately by thyself in thy mind, or by thy words or
   external deeds, or carriage towards, or with others; by this means
   casting away and mortifying within thee all vainglory and complacence
   in thyself for any talent, gift, or thing corporal or spiritual that
   God hath bestowed on thee. Also mortify and destroy within thee, so
   soon as thou art able, all envy and anger towards thy Christian
   brethren; whether they be rich or poor, good or bad, hate them not, nor
   disdain them, nor willingly offend them by words or by deeds. Likewise
   destroy and mortify in thee all coveting of worldly goods, and see that
   neither for the getting, or holding, nor saving of them, thou do not
   offend thy conscience, nor break verity with God, or thy Christian
   brother, for the love of any earthly thing; but what thou gettest, or
   hast, keep it without inordinate love or affection to it, and spend it
   as reasonable occasions shall require, for the honour of God, and the
   succour of thy Christian brother. Mortify also, and destroy as much as
   thou canst, all yielding to bodily sloth, and unnecessary bodily ease,
   and the sensual vices of gluttony and luxury, with the inordinations
   that rise out of them. And after that thou hast been well exercised and
   tried in all such kind of corporal works, thou mayest then by the grace
   of God, ordain thee and apply thee to spiritual working.

   The grace and goodness of our Lord Jesus Christ, that He hath showed to
   thee, in withdrawing of thine heart from the love and liking of worldly
   vanity, and from the use of fleshly and sensual sins, and in turning of
   thy will entirely to His service, bringeth into mine heart much matter
   to love Him in His mercy; and also it greatly moveth and urgeth me to
   strengthen thee in thy good purpose, and in the work which thou hast
   begun between thee and God, so that it may be brought to a good end.
   And so far as may be in my power to help thee in it, my best endeavours
   in it I shall most willingly afford thee, first and principally for the
   service and honour of God, and next in requital of thy tender affection
   of love thou bearest to me, though I be a wretch, and unworthy of thy
   love or favour. I know well the desire of thy heart, as how that thou
   greatly covetest to serve our Lord both in soul and body, fully and
   wholly, without intermeddling or troubling thyself in worldly
   businesses, that so thou mayest, by the grace of God, attain to more
   knowledge, and spiritual feeling of God, and of spiritual things. Such
   desire of thine is (as I hope) good, and from God, for it is set upon
   Him in charity spiritually. Nevertheless, as in regard of external
   matters and workings in them, such desire of thine is to be moderated
   and ruled with discretion, according to the nature and quality of thy
   estate, which thou art to regard in thy spiritual intentions; for
   charity unruled, that is, not rightly ordered, turneth sometimes into a
   fault or vice. And therefore it is said of our Lord by a holy soul in
   the holy Scripture: He hath ordered charity in me; [1] that is to say,
   our Lord giveth to me charity, hath set it in order and good rule
   within me, whereby it might not err in its exercise, nor be lost
   through my indiscreet doings. Even so the said desire and charity which
   our Lord hath wrought in thee, out of His goodness and mercy, must be
   so ruled and moderated, that in the exercises of it, it do regard the
   nature of thy estate and condition of life, and the manner of living,
   which in former time thou hast held, and the measure and quantity of
   virtues that now are in thee. Thou must not altogether follow thy said
   desire in giving over or neglecting those businesses and cares of the
   world that are necessary, and do belong to thee, either for thee
   upholding of thy own person in his degree, or in the ruling or ordering
   of other persons or things that pertain to thy charge, and give thee
   wholly to retiredness, spiritual devotions and holy meditations, as if
   thou wert a Friar or Monk, or another man that were not bound (as thou
   art) to the world by children or servants; for it is not for thee to do
   so, and if thou dost, then keepest thou not the order of charity. Also
   if thou wouldst altogether leave and forbear all spiritual exercises
   (especially now after the grace and calling that God hath given thee
   for them) and give thyself wholly to the businesses of the world, in
   fulfilling of the works of the active life, as fully as do other men,
   that never felt such devotions nor had such grace or calling as thou
   hast, thou dost then leave the order of charity; for thy state
   requireth of thee to attend to each of them in divers times. Thou shalt
   mingle the works of active life with the spiritual works of the
   contemplative life, and then thou dost well; for thou shalt sometimes
   be busy, with Martha, for to order and govern thine household, thy
   children, thy servants, thy neighbours and thy tenants. If they do
   well, comfort and help them therein; if they do amiss, then tell and
   teach them for their amendment, and chastise them as there shall be
   cause. Thou shalt also wisely look after and know thy things and thy
   worldly goods, as that they be well and duly used or preserved by thy
   servants, well ordered and reasonably spent, whereby thou mayest the
   more plenteously, out of thy temporal means, fulfil the deeds of mercy
   and charity towards thy Christian brethren. Also thou shalt sometimes,
   with Mary, leave or lay aside the businesses of the world, and shalt
   sit down at the feet of our Lord with humility, in prayers and holy
   thoughts, and in Contemplation of Him, according to the grace that He
   shall give thee for it, and so thou shalt go from that one to that
   other, profitably and fruitfully, and fulfil them both; and so doing
   thou observest well the order of charity.

CHAPTER II

   To what kind of Men the Active Life pertaineth

   BUT that thou mayest the less wonder at that that I have said, and that
   thou mayest better understand the reason thereof, therefore I shall
   declare the matter a little more fully to thee. Thou must understand
   that God is served by three kinds of life, as either by an active life,
   or by a contemplative, or by a third, that is mixed of them both, and
   therefore is commonly called a mixed life. The active life belongeth to
   worldly men and women that are gross and ignorant, as to the
   understanding or knowledge of spiritual exercises or ways, for they
   neither feel nor taste devotion by fervour of love as other men do, nor
   can they well conceive what it is or how it may be come by; and
   nevertheless, they have in them the fear of God and of the pains of
   Hell, and therefore they eschew and forbear sin, and have a desire for
   to please God, and to attain to Heaven, and a good will they bear to
   their Christian brethren. Unto these men it is needful and speedful to
   use the works of the active life as diligently as they can in the help
   of themselves and of their Christian brethren, for more they cannot do.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER III

   To whom the Contemplative Life appertaineth

   THE Contemplative life appertaineth only to such men and women as for
   the love of God have forsaken all notorious sins, both of the flesh and
   of the world, and have given over all intermeddling with the affairs
   and businesses of the world, or with worldly goods, as also all care
   and charge over others, and all superiority or offices that concern the
   government of others (if ever they had any such) and make themselves
   poor and, as it were, naked from all the things of this life save for
   what their corporal nature doth merely need and of necessity require.
   Unto these men and women it appertaineth diligently and seriously to
   employ themselves in internal exercises for to get thereby (through the
   grace of our Lord) cleanness in heart and peace in conscience by
   destroying of sin and gaining of virtue, and so to come to
   Contemplation; since such cleanness (necessary for Contemplation)
   cannot be had without much exercise of body and continual travail or
   industry in spirit, by devout prayers, fervent desires and spiritual
   meditation.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER IV

   To whom appertained the Mixed Life

   THE third kind of life that is called the mixed life belongeth to
   Prelates of holy Church and to pastors and curates who have charge and
   superiority over other men or women, for to teach and govern them, both
   as to their bodies and as to their souls, and principally to animate
   and guide them in the performance of the deeds of mercy both corporal
   and spiritual towards their Christian brethren. Unto these men of the
   mixed life it appertaineth sometimes to use the works of mercy in
   active life, in help and sustenance of themselves and of their subjects
   and of others also, and sometimes for to leave all manner of external
   businesses and to give themselves to contemplative exercises, as to
   prayer and meditations, reading of holy Scriptures or other good books
   or to some other spiritual exercises, according to what they shall feel
   themselves disposed. Also, this mixed life appertaineth to some
   temporal men, who are owners of much land and goods and have withal
   some dominion or mastership over other men, for to govern and sustain
   them, as a father hath over his children, and a master over his
   servants, and a lord over his tenants; the which men have received also
   of our Lord's gift, the grace of Devotion, and in some measure a taste
   and practice of spiritual exercise. Unto these men, I say, belongeth
   the foresaid mixed life, that is both active and contemplative; for if
   these men having (as they have) such external charge and cares lying on
   them, out of some obligation or necessity, would altogether leave or
   neglect such charge and businesses of the world pertaining to them, and
   give themselves wholly to the exercises of contemplative life, they
   would not do well in so doing, for they observe not the order of
   charity; for charity (as thou well knowest) consisteth in the love of
   God and of thy Christian brethren. And therefore he that hath charity
   in him, will not by occasion of his devotions, used immoderately
   towards God, omit that which he ought to do towards his Christian
   brother, but will serve both God and them for God, at divers times, as
   now the one and then the other; for he that for the loving of God in
   Contemplation leaveth the loving of his Christian brethren, and doth
   not perform towards them that which he ought, and is bound unto, he
   fulfilleth not the rule and obligation of charity. Likewise on the
   contrary side whoso hath so great a regard to the works of the active
   life and to the business of the world that for the love of his
   Christian brethren, and the serving of them, he leaveth or neglecteth
   all spiritual exercises, God having given him a call thereunto, he
   fulfilleth not charity, and so saith St Gregory. For though our Saviour
   Christ, for to stir up some to use the mixed life, took upon Himself
   the person of such manner of men, i.e., both of Prelates and of such
   other as are of the said mixed estate, and gave them example by His own
   working that they should upon occasion use the exercises of the mixed
   life, as He Himself did at those times that He spoke with men and
   meddled with them, showing and exercising His deeds of mercy towards
   them, taught the ignorant by His preaching, visited the sick and healed
   them of their diseases, fed the hungry and comforted the sorrowful;
   nevertheless, at other times He left the conversation of worldly men,
   and even of His own disciples, and went into the desert upon the hills,
   and continued there all night all alone in prayers, as the Gospel
   testifieth to us. And this mixed life did our Lord in Himself exercise,
   and show in the same manner, for an example to all other men that have
   taken on them the state or condition that requireth the exercises of
   the said mixed life, that is to say, that they should sometimes apply
   themselves to the external affairs and businesses belonging to their
   charge, and to the curing of such their Christian brethren as pertain
   to them to look to, instruct or provide for; and this to do according
   to reason and discretion and their need; and at another time to give
   themselves to devotion and to the exercises of a Contemplative life,
   being principally (as before I have said) reading and praying.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER V

   How holy Bishops held and used the said Mixed Life

   THE said mixed life did holy Bishops hold and lead, who had charge over
   men's souls and had the ministration and disposal of temporal goods;
   for those holy men did not wholly forsake the administration looking
   to, and the disposal of worldly goods, and give themselves altogether,
   or unreasonably to Contemplation, notwithstanding the grace and gift
   they had for Contemplation; but very often left their own rest in
   Contemplation (which for their parts they had much rather have
   continued in still) for the love and service of their Christian
   brethren, and were contented to intermeddle with worldly businesses,
   for succouring and helping of those that were under their charge; and
   surely such doing of theirs was true charity. For justly and discreetly
   did they divide the time of their life into two parts, whereof the one
   they bestowed in the lower part of love and charity, that is to say, in
   the works of the active life (for they were bound thereto by taking on
   them their Prelacy): and another part of their time they spent in the
   higher part of love and charity, and that was in the contemplation of
   God, and of spiritual things by prayers and holy recollections; and so
   they had and held charity to God and their Christian brethren, both
   interiorly in affection of soul, and also exteriorly by doing and
   performing good corporal or external works. Other men that were only
   contemplatives, and were free from all cares and Prelacies, they also
   had charity towards God and their Christian brethren, but it was only
   interiorly in the affection of their soul, and not used outwardly in
   corporal deeds; and it may be it was so increased inwardly through
   their contemplations, that they needed not to intermeddle with external
   things for the bettering their charity, nor did it belong to their
   state of life to seek after such external workings, nor to intermeddle
   therewith, there being no necessity nor obligation for it on them; and
   so their internal charity sufficed for them. But those, whom before I
   mentioned, that were in Prelacy, and others also that were holy secular
   men, had perfect charity, both interiorly in their affection and did
   also exercise the same exteriorly in bodily working or deeds, and such
   doing is properly the mixed life which I have spoken of, consisting of
   the active and contemplative both together. And surely for such men
   that are in spiritual superiority, or have charge of the souls of
   others, as Prelates, Pastors and Curates have, or that are in temporal
   authority in the government of others, as worldly Lords and Masters
   are, I hold this mixed life best, and most expedient or necessary for
   them, so long as they remain in the said superiority and charge over
   others. But as for others that are free, and not obliged to any
   ministration or superiority, temporal or spiritual, I judge that the
   contemplative life alone by itself (if they have grace and calling to
   it) were, in truth, the best, the most expedient, most meritorious,
   most fair and most worthy for them to use, and not willingly to leave
   it for any outward working of the active life, unless it were in case
   of great need, as for the helping or comforting of some other men,
   either in their bodies or in their souls; and need requiring it, he to
   go about the doing of it, either when the party, or some other for him,
   requesteth, and craveth at his hands the doing of it; or that himself
   sees a mere necessity in the case, or else (being religious) when he is
   bidden by his superior to undertake or intermeddle with the work.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VI

   That kind of Life was most fitting for him for whom this Treatise was
   made

   BY that which I have said thou mayest partly understand the differences
   between one and another of the aforesaid three kinds of lives; and thou
   mayest by what I have said also judge which of them best fitteth thee,
   since that our Lord hath ordained and set thee in a state of
   superiority (of such nature as it is) and authority over others, and
   hath lent thee some store of worldly goods and lands, by the which thou
   mayest not only maintain and sustain thyself, but also all those other
   special persons that are under thy authority and government, and
   mightest withal govern them according to thy best knowledge and
   ability; and therewith also thou hast, through the goodness of our
   Lord, received from Him the grace for to know thyself, and a spiritual
   desire and taste of His love. I am of the mind that the life which I
   have termed to be mixed is best and most befitting thee; and thou
   accordingly to divide and dispose of thy time wisely and to the
   satisfaction of the foresaid rule of charity. For know thou well that
   if thou leave the necessary business or the active life belonging to
   thee, and be careless, and take no heed of thy worldly goods as how
   they be kept or spent, nor lookest after those that pertain to thy
   charge to see they do well, nor wilt afford thy help upon the necessity
   of thy Christian brother by reason of thy love and desire thou hast to
   apply thyself only to solitude and spiritual exercises, imagining that
   by so doing thou art excused and freed from thy foresaid obligations.
   If, I say, thou do so, thou dost not wisely nor profitably for thy
   soul; for what are thy works or exercises worth (be they spiritual or
   corporal) unless they be done according to justice and reason, to the
   honour of God and agreeable to His will? surely they are even nothing
   worth. Therefore if thou leave or neglect that thing which thou art
   bound unto by the law of charity, justice or other obligation, and wilt
   entirely give thee to another thing, voluntarily taken on thee, under
   pretense of better pleasing and serving of God, in a thing which thou
   art not bound unto, in so doing thou dost no discreet or acceptable
   service to Him. In so doing thou art careful to do honour and worship
   to His head and to His face, and to deck and adorn them fairly and
   curiously, but thou neglectest and leavest His body, with the feet,
   ragged and rent, and takest no care nor heed of them, nor dost thou
   anything honour Him; and it is but a shame and an indignity and no kind
   of honour for a man to be curiously dressed and decked about his head
   with pearls and precious stones, and therewith to have all his body
   naked and bare, as it were a beggar. Even so spiritually, it is no
   honour to God for one to crown His head and leave His body bare; for
   thou must understand that our Lord Jesus Christ, as a man, is the head
   of His spiritual body, which is the holy Church, the members or limbs
   of His body are all Christian men, some are arms, some are feet, and
   some are other members, according to the qualities, condition or
   estates they are of in the holy Church.

   And now if thou be diligent with all thy skill and ability for to deck
   and adorn His head, that is, for to honour Him with the remembrance of
   His passion and of His other works done in His humanity, with devotion,
   love and thanks to Him for the same, and forgettest or neglectest His
   feet (which are thy children, thy servants, thy tenants and all thy
   Christian brethren) and lettest them to decay or perish for want of
   looking to, or to want clothing sufficient, or other necessaries, or
   otherwise not looked unto and provided for as they ought to be, then
   dost thou not please Him, nor doest Him any honour; thou seemest to
   kiss His mouth by devotion and spiritual prayer, but thou treadest upon
   His feet, and defilest them, inasmuch as thou wilt not tend to them
   (through thy negligence) that belong to thy charge and care. This is my
   opinion and advice to thee in this point; nevertheless if thou be of
   the mind that I say not aright in this matter, for that thou thinkest
   it were a fairer and more pleasing office to God for to do honour to
   His head, as to be all day devoutly thinking of His passion, and
   producing acts of inward affection upon it, than for to go home to
   other works that are more external, and make clean His feet, as for to
   employ thyself both in words and deeds about the helping or benefiting
   of thy Christian brethren, in so thinking thou thinkest amiss, and
   mistakest. For surely he will more thank thee and reward thee for the
   humble washing of His feet when they are very foul, and yield an ill
   savour to thee, than for all the curious painting and fair dressing or
   decking that thou canst make about His head, by the devoutest
   remembrance of His humanity; for it is fair enough, and needeth not
   much decking or dressing from thee; but for His feet, and other His
   limbs, that are sometimes ill-arrayed, and have need to be holpen by
   thee (namely, since thou art bound thereto), our Lord will render thee
   more thanks, if thou wilt humbly and charitably look unto them.

   For the lower or meaner that the service which thou dost to thy Lord
   seemeth to be, in regard they are performed towards His members, and
   not immediately towards Himself, yet doing it for the love of Him, when
   reasonable occasions or need require it, and that with a cheerful and
   humble heart, thou much more pleasest Him than in service immediately
   done to Himself with omission of these offices of need or charity
   towards thy Christian brethren. And that thou mayest be the more
   willing to go about such an employment, thou shalt do well to think
   that it is sufficient, and best of all for thee to be employed in the
   very least degree, and lowest estate of His service, especially since
   it is His will that it be so. For thou must think, that since He hath
   put thee into that charge and estate of life, that it is the very best
   for thee, and that thou canst not do better than in performing what
   belongs thereto in the best manner and with all the willingness and
   gladness of mind that thou art able.

   This I tell thee not as though that already thou dost it not, and
   better too; but to the end that thou shouldst do it with more alacrity
   and cheerfulness by occasion of this my writing; and shouldst not think
   it much sometimes to lessen or forbear thy spiritual exercise for to go
   and deal in worldly affairs pertaining to thee and thy estate, as to
   the looking and seeing too, that thy goods be well kept and spent
   according to reason, looking to the behaviour of thy servants and thy
   tenants, and doing other good deeds towards thy Christian brethren
   according to thy ability and their need, but shouldst perform both
   these works and exercises, that is to say, the internal and external,
   at divers and several times, and with as good a will the one as the
   other, so far as thou canst. As for example, if thou hast been at thy
   prayer and spiritual exercise, that finished thou shalt go and busy
   thyself in some corporal or external doing concerning thy Christian
   brethren, and therefore spend reasonable time with willingness and
   gladness of mind. And after that thou hast been busily employed for a
   time about thy servants, and other men with whom thou shalt have
   occasions, and hast profitably spent with them so much time as shall be
   truly needful, thou shalt then break from these external doings, and
   shalt return again to thy prayers and devotions, which thou shalt
   perform according to the grace that God shall give thee for it; and so
   doing, thou, by the grace of our Lord, shalt put away and avoid sloth,
   laziness, idleness and vain rest, which often creep upon us through the
   deceitfulness of our nature, under pretense or colour of contemplation
   or other spiritual recollections; whereby we come to omit the
   performance of good and meritorious external affairs and businesses
   pertaining to us and our charge by the appointment or providence of
   God. And thus thou shalt be always in some good exercise or other,
   internal or external, by turns, and in their proper times.

   Therefore thou shalt do well to observe and do that spiritually, that
   is, in thy carriage in a spiritual life, which Jacob did in a matter
   that was only corporal or external. The holy Scripture telleth, how
   that Jacob, when he began to serve his master Laban, he coveted Rachel
   his master's daughter for her fairness to be his wife, and for the
   having of her he served seven years; but when he had thought for to
   have had her to his wife, he had first Leah, the other daughter,
   instead of Rachel, and afterwards he takes Rachel, and so he had both
   at the last. By Jacob in holy Scripture is understood an overcomer of
   sins; by those two wives are understood, as St Gregory saith, the two
   kinds of lives that are in the holy Church, which are the active life
   and the contemplative life. Leah is as much to say as labour and
   painful working, and betokeneth the active life. Rachel is as much as
   to say as a sight of the beginning, which is God, and betokeneth the
   contemplative life. Leah bore children, but she was sore-eyed. Rachel
   was fair and lovely, but she was barren. And now even as Jacob coveted
   Rachel for her fairness, and yet had her not when he would, but first
   took Lead and afterwards Rachel, even so, every man labouring, and
   heartily seeking (by compunction for his former great sins of the flesh
   and of the world) now to become a new servant to God in cleanness of
   good living, hath a great desire to have and come by Rachel, which is
   to have rest in spiritual sweetness, devotion and contemplation, for it
   is so fair, and so lovely a life, that in hope for to have it he
   determined with himself, by the grace of our Lord, for to serve Him
   with all his diligence and might; but oft-times when he thinketh to
   have Rachel, that is, rest in devotion, our Lord suffereth him to be
   well exercised and tried, either with the temptations of the world, or
   of the devil, or of his flesh, or else with some external businesses
   and doing, corporal or spiritual, in help or succour of his Christian
   brethren; and when he is thus well exercised, and in travails with
   Leah, and is well-nigh overcome, then our Lord giveth him Rachel, that
   is, grace and devotion, and rest in conscience, and then hath he both
   Rachel and Leah.

   So shalt thou do, according to the example of Jacob, these two lives,
   active and contemplative, since God calleth and enableth thee for both,
   and use the one with the other of them. By the one life (which is the
   active) thou shalt bring forth the fruit of many good deeds in help of
   thy Christian brethren; and by the other shalt thou be made to become
   fair, clear-sighted and clean in the supreme brightness and beauty,
   which is God, the beginner and ender of all that is made, and then
   shalt thou be truly Jacob, and an out-goer and overcomer of all sins;
   and after that, by the grace of God, thy name shall be changed, as
   Jacob's name was, and turned into Israel, and Israel is as much as to
   say: a man seeing God. Therefore, if thou be first Jacob, and will
   discreetly use these two lives afterwards, in time thou shalt be
   Israel, that is, a true Contemplative, either in this life, if God will
   deliver thee, and make thee free from the charges and businesses which
   thou art bound to, or else after this life, fully and perfectly in the
   bliss of heaven when thou comest thither. A man shall desire a
   contemplative life, for it is fair and full of merit, therefore thou
   shalt ever have it in thy mind, and in thy desire; but thou shalt have
   in using active life, for it is both expedient and necessary.
   Therefore, if upon just occasions, either concerning thy children or
   thy servants or any other of thy Christian brethren, for their profit
   or their heart's ease, upon reasonable cause, asking it of thee, thou
   be put from thy rest in devotion, when thou hadst much rather stay
   still thereat, be not angry with them, nor heavy or sad within thyself,
   so far as thou art able to help it, nor afraid, as if God would be
   angry with thee, that thou leavest Him for any other business or doing,
   for He will not be angry but well pleased and delighted thou so do. And
   therefore in such a case readily leave off thy devotion of what kind
   soever it be, and go about the deed, being service to thy Christian
   brethren, and that as willing and readily, as if our Lord Himself had
   called and bidden thee to go about it. Do so, I say, and endure the
   difficulty thou findest in it for His love; and put away all grudging
   for it, so far as thou canst; as also all bitterness and offence taken
   against thy Christian brother for calling thee to the said employment.

CHAPTER VII

   That a Man's Devotion sometimes will be the greater by reason of the
   outward Work which before out of Charity he had been in hand with

   AND it may fall out sometimes that the greater trouble thou hast
   exteriorly had in doing of thy active works, the more inflamed desire
   shalt thou afterwards have to God and the more sight of God and
   spiritual things, through the grace of our Lord, in devotion when thou
   comest thereto; for it fareth thereby as if thou hadst a little coal of
   fire, and wouldst make a fire therewith, and make it burn; thou wouldst
   first lay to some sticks, and with them over-cover the coal so that
   there is as yet no show or seeming hope of fire by it; nevertheless
   when thou hast abiden awhile and afterwards blowest it a little, anon,
   suddenly there will arise out a great flame of fire, so that the sticks
   will be turned all into fire. Even so is it spiritually; thy will and
   thy desire that thou hast to God is as it were a little coal of fire in
   thy soul, for it giveth to thee somewhat of light and of spiritual
   heat; but it is very little that it giveth, for often it waxeth cold
   and turneth to a fleshly rest (or into a rest of flesh and sensuality)
   and sometimes into idleness and doing of no good; therefore it is
   expedient that thou put to sticks, that is, some works of the active
   life; and though it be so that those works do seem for a time to be a
   let to thy desire, so that it may not be so entire nor so fervent as
   thou wouldst it were, yet be not daunted nor troubled thereat, but
   abide and suffer awhile, and so blow at the fire; that is, first go and
   do thy works, and afterwards, go alone to thy prayers and devotions,
   and lift up thine heart to God, and pray Him that of His goodness He
   will accept thy works that thou doest and receive them to His honour
   and glory; hold them as nothing in thine own sight, nor to be of any
   worth save so far as God only out of His goodness shall vouchsafe to
   accept of them; humbly acknowledge thy wretchedness and frailty really
   attributing thy good deeds to Him; and so much as they have any
   goodness in them, and inasmuch as they are bad, or not done discreetly
   with all circumstances requisite for a good deed, ascribe them to
   thyself, and then for this humility shall all thy good deeds turn into
   a flame of fire as do sticks laid upon a coal; and thou thus doing, thy
   external good deeds shall not hinder thy devotion but rather increase
   it. And moreover, our Lord saith in holy Scripture thus: Fire shall
   always burn in My Alter, and the Priest rising up in the morning shall
   put wood thereunto, so that the fire may not be extinguished. [2] This
   fire is love and desire to God in a soul, the which fire requireth that
   it be nourished and maintained by laying to sticks, so that it may not
   go out; and these sticks are of divers matters, as some of one kind of
   wood and some of another. A man that is learned and hath some
   understanding in the holy Scripture, if he have this fire of devotion
   in his heart, it is good for him to get him sticks of holy examples and
   devout prayers, and nourish the fire with them. Another man that is
   unlearned cannot so readily have at hand the sayings of holy Scripture,
   or of Doctors for the purpose, and therefore it is necessary for him to
   do many good external deeds to his Christian brethren, and thereby
   maintain and exercise towards them the love he beareth them for God.

   And so it is good that each man in his degree, and according to what is
   most agreeable to the benefit and disposition of his soul, do get him
   sticks of one thing or another, as either by praying, considering,
   meditating or reading in some good and devout book, or in doing of some
   corporal or external work, thereby for to nourish in his soul the fire
   of love so that it may not become quenched; for the affection of love
   is dainty and tender, and will easily go out and vanish away unless it
   be well kept and continually nourished by good deeds or exercises,
   corporal or spiritual.

   Now therefore, since our Lord hath put into thine heart a little
   sparkle of this blessed fire, that is Himself, (as holy Scripture
   saith, Our Lord is a consuming fire; [3] for, as a material fire
   wasteth all bodily things that may be wasted, so a spiritual fire, that
   is God, wasteth all kind of sin, and therefore our Lord is likened to
   fire wasting) I pray thee to nourish this fire within thee. This fire
   is nothing else but Love and Charity. This hath He sent into the earth,
   as He saith in the Gospel: I came to send fire into the earth, and to
   what end, but that it might burn? [4] that is, God hath put into man's
   soul a fire of love and a good desire, and a great good will for to
   please Him, and that He hath done to this end, that man should know it,
   keep it, and nourish it, and strengthen and increase it, and thereby be
   saved. The greater desire that thou hast to Him and for Him, the
   greater is the fire of love in thee, and the less that the desire is in
   thee, the less is the fire. The quantity or measure of thy desire
   within thee, how much it is, neither thyself doth know, nor doth any
   man know how great it is in him, much less the quantity of love that is
   in another man; God only knoweth it, or he to whom God shall reveal and
   make it known. And therefore dispute not with thyself as if thou
   wouldst know how great thy desire is; be busy and serious to desire as
   much as thou canst, but not to know the quantity or measure of thy
   desire.

CHAPTER VIII

   What the Desire of God for Himself is and how that in Cleanness of
   Conscience is found true Comfort and Sweetness

   SAINT AUGUSTINE saith that the life of every good Christian man is a
   continual desire to God, and such desire is of great power and virtue,
   for it is a great crying in the ears of God; the more fervently thou
   desirest, the higher thou criest, the better thou prayest, and the
   wiser are thy thoughts. And what is this desire? Surely nothing but a
   loathing of all this worldly bliss, a forsaking of all fleshly or
   sensual love in thine heart, and an extreme loving, with a most hungry
   longing and thirsting after God and the everlasting bliss of Heaven;
   this is that which may be called a desire of God for Himself.

   If thou hast this desire, as I verily hope and believe that thou hast,
   I pray thee keep it well and nourish it diligently; and when thou shalt
   pray or meditate of God, make this desire of Him to be the beginning
   and final intention of such thy exercises, and of all other thy works
   and deeds, thereby to increase it. Seek and nourish only this, and seek
   not after any feeling in thy corporal senses, external or internal, nor
   any sensible sweetness or devotion, neither by the ear nor by the taste
   of thy palate, nor by any wonderful light or sight of thy eyes, nor
   seek the sight of Angels, no, though our Lord Himself would appear in
   His body to the sight of thy eyes, make no great matter of that; and
   therefore let all thy diligence be that thou mayest truly and really
   perceive and find in thy soul, and especially in thy will, a loathing
   and full forsaking of all manner of sin and of all manner of
   uncleanness, with a spiritual seeing or perceiving how foul, how ugly
   and how painful these things be; and that thou mayest have within thee
   a mighty desiring of virtues, and, namely, of humility and charity, and
   finally, of the bliss of Heaven. This that I shall now tell thee were
   (as I would think) a spiritual comfort, and a spiritual sweetness in a
   man's soul; and that is, to have cleanness in conscience from
   wickedness and from all worldly vanities, with a firm faith and humble
   hope and a full desire of God. Howsoever it be for having of other
   comforts and sweetnesses I esteem that sweetness to be true, sound and
   secure that is found in cleanness of conscience, with a strong will of
   forsaking and loathing of all sins, and with inward sight and fervent
   desire of spiritual things; all other comforts and sweetnesses caused
   by any manner of feelings, unless they lead or help to the said end,
   that is, to cleanness of conscience and spiritual desire of God, are
   not secure to rest on.

   But now thou wilt perhaps ask, whether this desire be love to God?

   As to that I answer and say: That this desire is not properly love, but
   a beginning and taste of love, for love properly is a perfect uniting
   and coupling together of the lover and the loved into one. Perfect love
   maketh God and the soul to be as if they both together were but one
   thing. But such perfect coupling and union may not be had in this life,
   but only in desire and longing thereto, as by the example that I shall
   now deliver thee. If a man love another man that is absent, he greatly
   desireth his presence. Even so spiritually, as long as we are in this
   life, our Lord is absent from us, so that here we may neither see Him
   nor feel Him as He is, and therefore are not able (for want of such
   sight and feeling) here to love Him in fulness and perfection and in
   reality as we might do if we had the sight of Him really, and as He is
   in His own being; the which, because we have not, nor shall have in
   this life, therefore all that we can do here is to have a desire and a
   great longing and thirsting for to be present with Him and see Him in
   His bliss, and to be fully and perfectly united unto Him in love. This
   desire we may have in us (of His gift) in this life, by the which we
   shall be saved, for it is love unto Him, such as may here be had. St
   Paul saith thus: We know that while we are in this body we are pilgrims
   (or strangers) from God. [5] That is, we abide in this earth, or
   banishment, absent from Heaven, for we here walk by faith, and not by
   sight (that is, we here live in faith, not in real sight of Him as He
   is); but we are bold, and have a good will rather to be absent from the
   body, and to be present to our Lord (that is, we, through cleanness of
   conscience and sure trust of salvation, dare desire parting from our
   body by bodily death, and thereupon to be present to our Lord);
   nevertheless, because as yet we may not, therefore we endeavour,
   whether present or absent, to please Him; that is, we strive against
   the sins of the world, and pleasures of the flesh, and sensuality, by
   desire to Him, seeking to burn and consume in the fire of such our
   desire all things that may let or hinder us from Him.

   But thou wilt perhaps further ask me: Whether a man may continually
   have this desire in his heart? and thou perhaps thinkest that he
   cannot.

   As to that I will answer according to my opinion in it, which is, that
   thou mayest have this desire in thine heart and intention virtually or
   habitually, always and continually; but thou canst not so have it as to
   working or exercising upon it, as thou mayest better understand by this
   example. If thou wert sick, thou wouldst have, as every man in such a
   case hath, continually a natural desire in thine heart of bodily
   health; and this whether thou be asleep or awake, but art thinking of
   some worldly things; thou hast then such a desire only in intention or
   habit, and not in using or acting upon it. But when thou thinkest on
   thy bodily sickness or on thy health, then hast thou thy said desire of
   health in using and acting. Even so it is spiritually in the desire of
   God. He who by the gift of God hath this desire, though he sleep, or
   else thinketh not on God, but on some other worldly things, yet hath he
   this desire in his heart and soul till he commit some deadly sin. But
   as soon as he thinketh on God or purity of life or the joys of Heaven,
   then his desire to God worketh actually, as long as he keepeth his
   thought and intention to please God, either in prayers, meditations, or
   any other good action, so that all his endeavour be to excite this
   desire, and discreetly use it sometimes in one deed, sometimes in
   another, according as he is disposed and hath grace thereto.

   This desire is the root of all thy actions that are rewardable. For
   whatever good deed thou doest for God's sake, whether it be bodily or
   spiritual, as when thou prayest or meditatest, it is an exercising and
   using of this desire. And therefore when thou doest any good work,
   scruple not whether thou desirest God or no, for thy deed showeth thy
   desire. Some ignorantly conceive that they desire not God except they
   be ever calling upon Him either with their mouths or their hearts; and
   therefore they are continually saying, Lord save me, or some such-like
   words; which words indeed are good, because they stir up the heart to a
   desiring of God. Yet nevertheless, without any such words, a pure
   thought of God, or any spiritual thing, or of virtue, or the humanity
   of Christ, or joys of Heaven, or understanding of the holy Scriptures,
   with love, may be better than such words. And the more spiritual thy
   thought is, the more is thy desire. Be not, therefore, in doubt whether
   thou desirest God, when thou thinkest upon Him or doest any outward
   good work to thy neighbour, for thy deeds show it. Nevertheless, though
   all thy good actions, spiritual and corporal, are a demonstration of
   thy desire to God, yet is there a great difference between spiritual
   and corporal deeds, for deeds of a Contemplative life are not so
   outward as the other; and therefore when thou prayest unto, or
   meditatest upon God, thy desire to Him is more entire, more fervent,
   more spiritual than when thou doest external works of charity to thy
   neighbour.

   Now, if thou ask me by what means thou shalt keep this desire, and
   nourish it, I shall tell a little in that point, not with the meaning
   that thou shalt or must use the self-same form that I tell thee for it;
   but that thou thereby have some kind of general example, whereof thou
   shalt make use upon thy need and according to thy manner --not my
   manner, unless mine seem more for thy purpose, for I neither may nor
   can tell thee fully what is best for thee to use; but I shall tell thee
   somewhat according to what I think.

CHAPTER IX

   How thou shalt Dispose thee to Devotion

   IN the night after thy sleep, if thou wilt rise to pray and serve our
   Lord, thou shalt feel thyself at the first to be fleshly, heavy, and,
   as it were, drowned in sensuality, and ofttimes impertinent thoughts of
   the world or other vanities pressing into thy mind. But then shalt thou
   dispose thee to pray, or to think some good thought, for to revive and
   quicken thine heart towards God, and do thou use all thy discreet
   industry, for the drawing up of thy thoughts from worldly vanities, and
   from vain imaginations that come into thy mind, that so thou mayest
   feel some devotion in such vocal prayers as thou shalt then use, if
   thou use any such; or else (if thou wilt) enter thou into some
   spiritual thoughts, whereby thou mayest not remain hindered and
   troubled with such vain thoughts of the world or of thy flesh. And now
   as for matter of good thoughts for thee, thou must know that there be
   divers matters of such thoughts or meditations, but which of them were
   best for thee to take and use I cannot tell thee.

   But I trow that such matter and manner of thinking or meditating,
   wherein thou feelest greatest gust, facility and ease or pleasure, is
   best for thee to use so long as it continueth so grateful to thy
   spirit. Thou mayest (it thou wilt) sometimes think on thy sins
   heretofore committed, and of the frailties into which thou daily
   fallest, and ask mercy and forgiveness for them. Also after this thou
   mayest think on the frailties and sins and miseries, corporal and
   spiritual, of thy Christian brethren, with pity and compassion of them,
   and ask mercy and forgiveness for them as tenderly as for thyself, and
   as if thou hadst done them, and that is a good exercise for the time.
   For I tell thee for truth that thou mayest make of other men's sins a
   precious ointment for to heal thine own soul, when thou thinkest on
   them with compassion and sorrow for them; this ointment is precious and
   very medicinal, though the spicery or things whereof it is composed be
   not clean, or otherwise wholesome; for it is treacle or mithridate,
   made of poison for to do away and destroy poison; that is to say, thine
   own and other men's sins. If thou beat and bruise them well with sorrow
   of thine heart, pity and compassion, they turn into treacle or
   mithridate, that will cleanse and make whole thy soul from pride and
   envy, and bring into it love and charity to thy Christian brethren.
   Such thought is good for thee sometimes to take into thee.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER X

   How a Man is to Think on the Humanity of Christ

   ALSO for thy exercise of devotion thou mayest think on the humanity of
   our Lord, as of His birth, of His Passion or of any other of His works,
   and feed thy thought with spiritual imagination thereof, for to move
   thine affection more to the love of Him. This thought (I mean of
   something of our Saviour's humanity) is good and expedient, namely,
   when it cometh freely of God's gift, with devotion and fervour of
   spirit, else a man will not likely find taste or devotion in it. And if
   he have it not with such facility and sending of God, I think it not
   expedient that a man should much force himself in it, as if he would
   get it by violence; for so doing he might hurt his head and body too,
   and yet be never the nearer. Therefore I think that it is good for a
   man to have in his mind and thought sometimes our Saviour's humanity,
   or some matter thereof; and if devotion come withal, and relish or gust
   found in it, then to hold it and follow it for a time, but leave off
   soon, and hang not long thereon. And if devotion come not by thinking
   of the Passion, strive not, nor press too much for to have and come by
   such devotion or feeling in it, but take what will easily come; and if
   it come not easily betake thee to some other matter, wherein thou
   thinkest or hopest to find more devotion or gust.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XI

   How a Man shall think on Virtues and upon the Saints

   ALSO other thoughts there be that are more spiritual, as to think on
   virtues, and to see by light of understanding the virtue of humility,
   what it is, and what great reasons be why a man should be humble; and
   also what is patience, cleanness in soul, justice, charity, sobriety
   and other such like virtues; and how worthy it is that a man should
   labour for the getting of them, and of the means by which they may be
   gotten, and by such thoughts to have a great desire and longing to the
   having of those virtues; and also for to have a spiritual sight of the
   three principal, or Theological Virtues, Faith, Hope and Charity. By
   the sight and desire of these virtues a soul should see and feel much
   grace of our Lord, without which grace a man's soul is half blind, and
   without spiritual sweetness or taste. Also, for to think on the saints,
   as the apostles, martyrs, confessors and holy virgins, beholding in his
   interior their holy living and the grace and virtues that our Lord gave
   them in their life, and by the remembrance and consideration hereof, to
   stir thy heart for to take example from them for leading a better and
   perfecter life.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XII

   How a Man shall think of the Holiness of our Lord Jesus and of our
   Blessed Lady

   ALSO the thinking and considering (above all other saints) of our Lady
   St Mary and her excellency in grace and virtues is a good matter for
   raising and exercise of devotion, by seeing with thy spiritual eye the
   abundance of grace that was in her holy soul when she was here living,
   which our Lord had given her, above what He gave to any of the other
   Saints; for she was replenished with all other virtues, without one
   spot of sin, showing and manifesting by her life perfect humility and
   fulness of charity, with the beauty and excellence of all other
   virtues, the which virtues altogether make her so holy, that there
   would no temptation, or motion of pride, envy, wrath or anger, sensual
   delight or of any other kind of sin or imperfection enter into her
   heart or defile her soul in any part of it. By the beholding of the
   beauty and excellency of this blessed soul, a man's heart should be
   moved and put into a great spiritual delight and comfort.

   And much more and above that is the beholding of the soul of our Lord
   Jesus, the which soul of His was fully and wholly united to the
   divinity, excelling without any comparison our blessed Lady and all
   other creatures. For in the Passion of Jesus are two natures, that is,
   God and man, perfectly united together. By the virtue of this most
   blessed union, which cannot be expressed nor yet conceived by man's wit
   or understanding, the soul of Jesus hath received the perfection and
   fulness of all wisdom and goodness; as the Apostle saith: The fulness
   of the divinity doth dwell is Christ corporally; [6] that is, the
   divinity of God was fully united to the humanity (or man's nature) in
   the soul of Jesus, and so, by the means of His soul dwelling in His
   body, the remembrance of the humanity of our Lord after this manner
   (that is, to regard the virtues and surpassing grace of the soul of
   Jesus) should be right comfortable to a man's soul.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [6] Col. 2:9.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XIII

   Of seeing and beholding the Power (by some consideration or thinking),
   the Wisdom, the Goodness and the Mercy of God in His Creatures

   ALSO the remembrance of the power, the wisdom and the goodness of our
   Lord in all His creatures; for as much as we living here on earth
   cannot see God fully and as He is in His essence, therefore we are to
   see and behold Him, love and fear Him upon the sight and consideration
   of His creatures and His works; and in them also are we to admire and
   wonder at His power and goodness. Also, for to think on the mercy of
   our Lord, that He hath showed to me and to thee, and to all sinful
   captives that sometimes were in bondage to the devil, through the
   greatness and multitude of our sins; how He patiently suffered us to
   live in our sin, and in our heinous contempts of Him, and work no
   revenge on us for the same, as He most justly might have done, and
   might most worthily have cast us down headlong into Hell, if His love
   had not hindered Him; but out of love He spared us, and sent His grace
   into our souls, taking us out of the state of heinous sins, and by His
   grace hath turned our will entirely unto Him, and made us thereby, for
   the having of Him, and for His love, to forsake all manner of sin. The
   remembrance of His mercy and goodness, in these and in other matters
   and points more and greater than I can now reckon up, may justly cause
   and bring into a soul a great truth and confidence in our Lord, and a
   full hope of salvation, and greatly inflameth the desire of love to
   aspire to the joys of Heaven.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XIV

   How the Consideration and thinking on the Miseries and Perils of this
   Life is apt to breed in a soul the Desire of Heaven

   ALSO to think upon the miseries, mischiefs and perils, corporal and
   spiritual, that happen in this life; and after that to think of the
   joys of Heaven, as how great happiness is there, and what wonderful joy
   and delight; for there is neither sin, nor sorrow, nor passion nor
   pain, hunger nor thirst, aches nor sickness, doubt nor fear, shame nor
   blame, nor want of power, nor strength, nor lack of light, nor coldness
   in love; but there is most excellent beauty, clearness, strength,
   health, everlasting delights, perfect wisdom, love, peace, honour,
   security, rest, joy and bliss in abundance without ever having any end.
   The consideration of these points ought to cause thee the more
   fervently to covet and desire those everlasting joys and rest of that
   same most blessed life. Many men are covetous of worldly goods, honours
   and earthly riches, and think both in dreaming and waking how and by
   what means they might come thereto; and then they forget all care of
   their souls' good, and all thoughts of the pains of Hell, or of the
   joys of Heaven. Surely these men are not wise; they are like to
   children that run after butterflies, and, because they look not to
   their feet, they sometimes easily fall down and break their legs. What
   is all the pomp, honours, riches and jollity of this world but a
   butterfly? Surely it is no more, yea, it is much less. Therefore, I
   pray thee, be covetous of the joys of Heaven, and thou shalt have
   honour and riches that shall last for ever. For at the latter day, when
   worldly covetous men bring no good in their hands (because all their
   honour and riches, which they only made account of, are turned into
   nothing but sorrow and pain) then the good men of the world, that have
   truly forsaken all vain honours and riches of this world, or else if
   they had them they made no account in their hearts of them, nor did set
   their love or delight in them, but have ever lived in the peace of God
   and in humility and in hope, and sometimes in sorrows or afflictions,
   and patiently expected the mercy of God; they (I say) shall then fully
   attain that which they here coveted, for they shall be crowned as
   kings, and shall ascend up with our Lord into the bliss of Heaven. Also
   there be many other good considerations or thoughts (more than I can
   speak of) that serve to stir and raise a man's mind and affection to
   loathe the vanities of this world and to desire the joys of Heaven.

   These matters I have not mentioned unto thee as if I had withal fully
   showed the manner how they are exercised in a man's soul; but I have
   only touched them a little, to the end thou mightest, by so much the
   better, understand these things for such use as thou canst best make of
   them.

CHAPTER XV

   How a Man shall do when he feeleth no taste nor comfort in his Mental
   Exercises

   NEVERTHELESS I would think it were good for thee that when thou
   disposest thee to think on God, as I have before said, or in any other
   manner, and peradventure thou feelest no gust nor devotion in thy
   exercise, but only a naked mind and a weak will; by which thou wouldst
   fain think on God, but canst not; then I think it is good for thee that
   thou strive not too much with thyself, for so thou mayest fall into
   greater darkness, unless thou knowest how to work more subtlety, and
   more above in spirit, and with all quietness in the senses. But thou
   not knowing how to do so for want of experience or skill in it, I hold
   it more secure for thee in such a case for to say thy Pater noster and
   thine Ave Maria, or else thy Matins, or to read in thy Psalter, for
   that is evermore a sure standard that will not fail. Whoso may cleave
   thereto he shall not err; and if thou canst by thy prayer get devotion,
   look then that this devotion be only in affection, that is to say in a
   great desire toward God, with a spiritual delight. Hold on then such
   thy saying of those vocal prayers, and not easily break off; for
   oftentimes it happeneth that praying with the mouth getteth and keepeth
   devotion, and if in such a case thou cease from saying, thy devotion
   withal vanisheth away.

   Nevertheless, if Devotion in prayer bring into thine heart a devout
   thought of the humanity of our Lord, or of any of the other matters
   before mentioned by me, and this thought should be hindered by thy
   saying of the vocal prayers, then will it be best for thee to cease
   from thy saying, and to feed thy mind and affection with the thought of
   the said good matter till it leave thee and be vanished away.

CHAPTER XVI

   What a Man is to take heed of in his Prayers and Meditations

   BUT of certain things it behoveth thee to beware in thy meditations; of
   some of them I shall tell thee. One is that when thou hast had a
   spiritual thought or imagination of the humanity of our Lord, or of
   other bodily things, and thy soul hath been comforted and fed
   therewith, and afterward it passeth away of itself; do not seek, as it
   were, by mastery or force to hold it still, for then it will turn thee
   into pain and bitterness. Also, if it pass not away, but dwell still in
   thy mind, without any travail or industry of thine, and thou, for the
   comfort thou findest in it, wilt not leave it, and thereupon it still
   continuing with thee, cometh to bereave or hinder thee of thy sleep at
   nights, or else in the day times hindereth thee from other good deeds,
   or else through the great fervour that it worketh in thy body, thy body
   or thine head by it falleth into a great feebleness, then must thou
   lessen or moderate, and sometimes forbear such exercise of thine, even
   when thou hast most devotion in it, or to it, and wouldst otherwise be
   most loth to forbear it, or part from it; and therefore thou must needs
   use discretion in the matter, for to avoid those mischiefs, or any of
   them, which now I have reckoned up to thee, or any other mischief or
   peril that may come to thee through indiscreet fervour or love to those
   thy exercises; and in particular, give it over when it is reasonable
   time to give it over, or when thy Christian brother may receive harm,
   or take just offence at thee by occasion of thy long stay at such thy
   devotions. If thou do otherwise in this matter than I have told thee, I
   think thou dost not well nor wisely in it.

   A worldly man or woman that peradventure feels not devotion twice in a
   year, if he (through the grace of our Lord Jesus) feel great
   compunction for his sins, or think seriously or devoutly on the Passion
   of our Lord, or upon any other good matter, if he by occasion thereof,
   and his devotion therein, be put from his sleep and his rest, for one,
   or two, or three nights, until his head ache, it makes no great matter,
   nor will he be the worse for it; such devotion cometh but seldom upon
   such persons. But as for thee, or any other man or woman, that every
   day duly performest, or hath such devotions, and intendest to continue
   in pursuing of such daily exercises, it is expedient for thee to use
   and hold discretion in thy performance of those thy exercises, and not
   fully to yield and plunge thyself into devotion, so far as it will
   offer itself unto thee, but moderate thyself in it, and take it
   moderately, though it offer itself to thee in abundance.

   Also I hold it good, that thou observe this discretion in thy exercise,
   which is, that thou tarry not too long at it, that thereby thou put
   thyself from taking thy meat or of thy sleep, when the time shall be
   for taking of them, or do give just cause of displeasure or damage to
   any other man, through occasion of overlong tarrying at such thy
   devotion. The wise man saith: That all things have their time. [7]

   Another thing which behoveth thee to beware of is that when thy mind
   hath been employed for a time in the imagination of the humanity of our
   Saviour, or any other good matter, and after this thou seekest with all
   the desire of thine heart, for to have a more spiritual knowing or
   feeling of the divinity; press not too much upon such desire, nor
   suffer the desire of thine heart to tarry too long therein, as if thou
   wert expecting and tarrying for some better or higher elevation of thy
   spirit, or for a feeling that had more worth or excelling in it than
   any thou hast hitherto had. Thou shalt not do so. It is enough for thee
   and for me for to have a desire and a longing to our Lord; and if He
   out of His grace and goodness will vouchsafe, over and above such
   desires of ours, freely, and of His own accord, to send us of His
   spiritual light, and open our spiritual eye, for to see or know more of
   Him than heretofore he did or could, by our own labour and industry,
   let us thank him for it; but if He do not (because we are not as yet
   humble enough, but were likely to grow proud by reason of such
   extraordinary favours, if He bestowed them on us, or are not disposed
   in other respects, and namely, by cleanness of conscience through well
   living, for to receive such grace and favour at His hands), then let us
   humbly acknowledge our own unworthiness, and hold ourselves satisfied
   with the desire we have of Him, and with other common good thoughts,
   that may easily be had and used by our imagination; as thinking of our
   sins, of Christ's Passion, or other such like things, or else with some
   vocal prayers of the Psalter or other vocal prayers, and thank Him with
   all our hearts, that He bestoweth upon us any portion of His grace or
   favour, though it be the least that any man hath. And if thou do
   otherwise, thou mayest easily be deceived (for thy presumption) by the
   spirit of error; for it is a great folly for a man of his own head or
   wilfulness to press or strain himself too much, to get into the sight
   or exercise of spiritual things further than he seeth well that he hath
   invitation and enablement for it. For the wise man saith that the
   searcher of the Majesty (of God) shall be oppressed by the glory of
   Him; [8] for not having humility, cleanness and worthiness in soul, for
   such a sight he shall be cast down, and made to know himself better
   than he did through this confusion. And therefore the same wise man in
   another place saith thus: Do not seek for things that are higher, nor
   search into things that pass thy strength; [9] that is to say, high
   things that are above thy natural reason and apprehension seek not
   after, and great matters that are above thy ability or strength do not
   search into. By these words the wise man doth not wholly forbid us to
   seek after and desire the knowing and having of spiritual and heavenly
   things, but he forbiddeth us to seek for them in a preposterous manner,
   which is too soon, and sooner than we are fit for them or that God
   calleth us to them, as when we are as yet sensual, and not cleansed
   from the vain love of the world; being in that degree, we are not to
   take upon us as if we could or would by our labour or industry, or by
   our own wit, enable ourselves to discern, see or know spiritual things,
   or procure in us great fervour of the love of God; so that albeit we
   see that we set at nought all worldly things, and it seem to us that we
   would for God's love forsake all the wealth, honour and joys of this
   world; yet for all this we are unfit and indisposed for to seek and
   behold spiritual things that are above us, until our souls through
   precedent exercises of the imagination, become to be more subtle, or as
   it were thin, or somewhat spiritual, and withal he become well
   mortified and settled in virtues by process of time and by increase in
   grace. For (as St Gregory saith) no man suddenly (or hastily) becometh
   supreme or perfect in grace, but beginneth with little, and proceedeth
   on by little and little, until that he come to be perfect, the which
   God grant that we all may one day be. Amen.

   FINIS.
