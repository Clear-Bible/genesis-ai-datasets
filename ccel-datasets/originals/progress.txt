   1853.

   "Howbeit, we speak wisdom among them that are perfect; yet not the
   wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to
   nought: but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden
   wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory."

   1 Cor. ii. 6.

EDITOR'S PREFACE.

   The Providence of God among the Churches seems to call to the present
   time for further light upon the subject of a higher experience than
   that usually attained by the members of our Christian societies. Among
   the teachers who have been from time to time anointed for this work,
   Fenelon and Madame Guyon are justly held in high estimation. While
   some, perhaps, have had a more interior experience, few, if any, have
   so joined to the deepest devotion, a power of spiritual analysis that
   eminently fitted them for the office of instructors.

   The extracts from Fenelon here given under the title of "Christian
   Counsel" have been translated from the "Avis Chretiens" contained in
   the fourth volume of the Paris edition of his works in 10 vols. 12 mo,
   1810.

   The Spiritual Letters are from the same source.

   The translation of the "Method of Prayer" is that which commonly passes
   under the name of Thomas Digby Brooke. It has been carefully compared
   and corrected by the Editions of the "Opuscules" published at Cologne
   1704, and Paris 1790. The "Concise View" and "Spiritual Maxims" which
   follow, have been translated from the Paris edition of 1790.

   It was at first proposed to have prefixed to the selections an account
   of the lives of the authors, but the design was subsequently abandoned.
   The very unsatisfactory character of a mere sketch, the space that
   would be demanded by anything like a fitting biography, and the very
   accessible form in which the materials have been lately placed by
   Professor Upham, are some of the reasons that contributed to the
   change.

   As this little work is intended to be simply devotional, matter of a
   purely sectarian or controversial character has been as far as possible
   omitted.

   And now, beloved reader, one word in conclusion, from the love of God
   to you. God has led you, in his Providence, to open this book that He
   may do you good. If through his infinite mercy you have had a personal
   experience of the matters herein written, your heart will be filled
   with thanksgiving and praise as you read. What hath God wrought! If
   not, you will find many things strange, and it would not be surprising
   if you should be ready to pronounce some untrue. But ah! beware of
   being wise in your own conceit! The Spirit of God that searcheth the
   deep things of God, alone can decide.

   Do not distrust the reports of these spies whom God has sent before you
   into the promised land. It is a land flowing with milk and honey; true,
   the children of Anak are there, in whose sight we are but as
   grasshoppers, but they are bread for us. The Lord God, He it is that
   shall fight for us, and He will surely bring us into that exceeding
   good land.

   The natural man receiveth not the things of God, for they are
   foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are
   spiritually discerned. If, then, you have not experienced the things
   that follow, think it not strange that they should seem foolish and
   false; in God's own time they shall be perceived, if you follow on to
   know.

   If you will be advised by one who knows nothing, and who is least in
   the household of faith, you will deny nothing--reject nothing--despise
   nothing, lest haply you be found fighting against God: you will receive
   nothing but what is accompanied by the Amen of the Spirit of God in
   your heart; all else shall be as the idle wind. Reading thus, in
   absolute dependence, not upon man's wisdom or teaching, but upon the
   utterances of the blessed Spirit within, you shall infallibly be guided
   into all Truth. Such is the promise of Him who cannot lie. And may His
   blessing rest upon you!

CHRISTIAN COUNSEL,

  ON DIVERS MATTERS PERTAINING TO

THE INNER LIFE.

    BY FENELON.

   "I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest
   be rich; and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed, and that the
   shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with
   eye-salve, that thou mayest see."--Rev. iii. 18.
     __________________________________________________________________

  I. OF THE LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD THERE IS IN THE WORLD

   What men stand most in need of, is the knowledge of God. They know, to
   be sure, by dint of reading, that history gives an account of a certain
   series of miracles and marked providences; they have reflected
   seriously on the corruption and instability of worldly things; they are
   even, perhaps, convinced that the reformation of their lives on certain
   principles of morality is desirable in order to their salvation; but
   the whole of the edifice is destitute of foundation; this pious and
   Christian exterior possesses no soul. The living principle which
   animates every true believer, God, the all and in all, the author and
   the sovereign of all, is wanting. He is, in all things, infinite--in
   wisdom power and love,--and what wonder, if everything that comes from
   his hand should partake of the same infinite character and set at
   nought the efforts of human reason. When He works, his ways and his
   thoughts are declared by the prophet to be as far above our ways and
   our thoughts as the heavens are above the earth (Isaiah Lv. 9). He
   makes no effort when He would execute what He has decreed; for to Him
   all things are equally easy; He speaks and causes the heavens and the
   earth to be created out of nothing, with as little difficulty as he
   causes water to descend or a stone to fall to the ground. His power is
   co-extensive with his will; when He wills, the thing is already
   accomplished. When the Scriptures represent Him as speaking in the
   creation of the world, it is not to be understood as signifying that it
   was necessary that the word of command should issue from Him, in order
   that the universe he was about to create should hear and obey his will;
   that word was simple and interior, neither more nor less than the
   thought which he conceived of what He was about to do and the will to
   do it. The thought was fertile, and without being rendered exterior,
   begat from Him as the fountain of all life, the sum of the things that
   are. His mercy, too, is but his pure will; He loved us before the
   creation of the world; He saw and knew us, and prepared his blessings
   for us; He loved and chose us from all Eternity. Every new blessing we
   receive is derived from this Eternal origin; He forms no new will
   respecting us; it is not He that changes, but we. When we are righteous
   and good, we are conformable to his will and agreeable to Him; when we
   depart from well doing and cease to be good, we cease to be conformable
   to Him and to please Him. This is the immutable standard which the
   changeable creature is continually approaching and leaving. His justice
   against the wicked and his love towards the righteous are the same
   thing; it is the same quality that unites Him to everything that is
   good, and is incompatible with everything that is evil. Mercy is the
   goodness of God, beholding our wickedness and striving to make us good;
   perceived by us in time, it has its source in the eternal love of God
   for his creature. From Him alone proceeds true goodness; alas! for that
   presumptuous soul that seeks it in itself! It is God's love towards us
   that gives us everything; but the richest of his gifts is that we may
   love Him with that love which is his due. When He is able by his love
   to produce that love in us, He reigns within; He constitutes there our
   life, our peace, our happiness, and we then already begin to taste that
   blissful existence which He enjoys. His love towards us is stamped with
   his own character of infinity: it is not like ours, bounded and
   constrained; when He loves, all the measures of his love are infinite.
   He comes down from Heaven to earth to seek the creature of clay whom he
   loves; He becomes creature and clay with him; He gives him his flesh to
   eat. These are the prodigies of Divine love in which the Infinite
   outstrips all the affection we can manifest. He loves like a God, with
   a love utterly incomprehensible. It is the height of folly to seek to
   measure infinite love by human wisdom. Far from losing any element of
   its greatness in these excesses, He impresses upon his love the stamp
   of his own grandeur, while He manifests a delight in us bounded only by
   the infinite. O! how great and lovely is He in his mysteries! But we
   want eyes to see them, and have no desire to behold God in everything.

  II. OF THE NECESSITY OF KNOWING AND LOVING GOD.

   It is not astonishing that men do so little for God and that the little
   which they do costs them so much. They do not know Him; scarcely do
   they believe that He exists; and the impression they have is rather a
   blind deference for general opinion than a lively and distinct
   conviction of the Divinity. They suppose it is so, because they do not
   dare to examine, and because they are indifferent in the matter, their
   souls being distracted by the inclination of their affections and
   passions for other objects; but their only idea of Him is of something
   wonderful, far off and unconnected with us. They think of Him as a
   stern and powerful Being, ever making requisitions upon us, thwarting
   our inclinations, threatening us with great evils, and against whose
   terrible judgment it behooves every one to be on his guard. Such is the
   inward thought of those who think seriously about religion, and their
   number even is small enough. "He is one who fears God," say they; and
   in truth such an one fears only, but does not love; as the child is in
   awe of the master who punishes him, or as the servant is in dread of
   the blows of one whom he serves from fear, and of whose interests is he
   utterly regardless. Would he like to be treated by a son or a servant
   as he treats God? It is because God is not known; if He were known, He
   would be loved. God is love, says the apostle John (1 John iv.8; 16) ;
   he who loves Him not, does not know Him, for how could we know love
   without loving it? It is plain, then, that all those who have hitherto
   only feared God, have not known Him.

   But who shall know Thee, O! my God? He who shall seek with his whole
   heart to know Thee, who shall know himself with approbation no longer,
   and to whom all that is not Thou shall be as though it were not! The
   world cannot receive this saying because it is full of self, and
   vanity, and lies, and is empty of God; but I trust that there will
   always be souls hungering for God, who will relish the truth which I am
   about to set forth.

   O my God! before Thou madest the Heavens and the earth, there was none
   other but Thee. Thou wert, because of thy years there was no beginning;
   but Thou wert alone. Out of Thee there was nothing, and Thou did'st
   rejoice in this blessed solitude; Thou are all sufficient in Thyself,
   and thou hadst no need of anything out of Thyself, for none can give
   unto Thee, and it is Thou that givest to all by thine all-powerful
   word, that is, by thy simple will. To it, nothing is difficult, and it
   doeth whatsoever it will from its own labor. Thou didst cause that this
   world, which was not as yet, should begin to be; not as the workmen of
   the earth, who find the materials for their work ready made to their
   hands, and whose art consists in bringing them together, and arranging
   them by slow degrees in the requisite order; Thou didst find nothing
   ready made, but didst create all the materials for thy work. It was to
   nothing that Thou didst say, "Let the world be," and it was. Thou didst
   only speak and it was done.

   But why didst Thou create all these things? They were all made for man
   and man was made for Thee. This is the order which is of thine
   appointment, and woe to him who inverts it, who would that all should
   be for him and shuts himself in self! He breaks the fundamental law of
   creation.

   No! Lord, Thou canst not yield the essential prerogatives of a creator;
   it would degrade Thee. Thou canst pardon the guilty soul that has
   warred against Thee, because Thou canst fill it with thy pure love; but
   thou canst not cease to be at variance with the soul which refers all
   thy gifts to itself, and refuses to embrace Thee as its Creator with a
   sincere and disinterested affection. To have no feeling but fear, is
   not to refer to itself to Thee, but on the contrary, to think of Thee
   solely with reference to self. To love Thee with a single eye to the
   good Thou canst bestow, is not to lose one's self in Thee, but to lose
   Thee in self! What then must be done in order that we may be lost in
   Thee? We must renounce, forget and forever lose sight of self, take
   part with Thee and shine, O God, against ourselves and ours; have no
   longer any will, glory or peace, but thine only; in a word, we must
   love Thee without loving self except in and for Thee.

   God who made us out of nothing, re-creates us, as it were, every
   moment. It does not follow that because we were yesterday, we shall of
   course be to-day; we should cease to exist and return into the
   nothingness out of which He formed us, did not the same all-powerful
   hand prevent. Of ourselves we are nothing; we are but what God has made
   us, and for so long time only as He pleases. He has but to withdraw the
   hand that sustains us and we plunge into the abyss of annihilation, as
   a stone held in the air falls by its own weight when its support is
   removed. Existence and life, then, are only ours because they are
   conferred by God.

   There are blessings, however, of a purer and higher order than these; a
   well-ordered life is better than life; virtue is of higher price than
   health; uprightness of heart and the love of God are as far above
   temporal goods as the heavens are above the earth. If then these lower
   and baser gifts are held only through the mercy and at the pleasure of
   God, with how much more reason must it be true of the sublime gift of
   his love!

   They know Thee not, then, O my God, who regard Thee as an all-powerful
   Being, separate from themselves, giving laws to all nature, and creator
   of everything which we behold; they know Thee but in part! they know
   not that which is most marvelous and which most nearly concerns thy
   rational creatures! To know that Thou art the God of my heart, that
   Thou there doest what pleaseth Thee, this it is that elevates and
   affects me! When I am good, it is because Thou renderest me so; not
   only dost Thou turn my heart as pleaseth Thee, but Thou givest me one
   like thine own! It is Thyself that Thou lovest in me; Thou art the life
   of my soul as my soul is the life of my body; Thou art more intimately
   present to me than I am to myself; this I, to which I am so attached
   and which I have so ardently loved, ought to be strange to me in
   comparison with Thee; Thou art the bestower of it; without Thee it
   never would have been; therefore it is that Thou desirest that I should
   love Thee better than it.

   O incomprehensible power of my Creator! O rights of the Creator over
   the creature which the creature will never sufficiently comprehend! O
   prodigy of love which God alone could perform! God interposes himself
   as it were, between me and myself; He separates me from myself; He
   desires to be nearer to me by his pure love than I am to myself. He
   would have me look upon this "me" as a stranger; He would have me
   escape from its walls, sacrifice it whole to Him, returning it
   absolutely and unconditionally to Him from whom I received it. What I
   am ought certainly to be less precious to me than He by whom I am. He
   made me for himself and not to be my own; that is, to love Him and to
   will what He wills, and not to seek my own will. Does any one feel his
   heart revolt at this total sacrifice of self to Him who has created us?
   I weep for his blindness; I compassionate his bondage to self, and pray
   God to deliver him from it, by teaching him to love Him above every
   other object.

   O my God! in these souls, offended at thy pure love, I behold the
   darkness and rebellion resulting from the fall! Thou didst not make
   man's heart will this monstrous passion of appropriation. The
   uprightness wherein the scriptures teach us he was originally created
   consisted in this, that he had no claim upon himself but acknowledged
   that he belonged to his Creator. O Father! thy children are sadly
   changed, and no longer bear thine image! They are enraged, they are
   discouraged when they are told they should belong to Thee as Thou
   belongest to Thyself! They desire to reverse this holy order, and would
   madly raise themselves into Gods; they desire to be their own, to do
   everything for self, or at least, to surrender themselves with certain
   reservations and conditions, and for their own advantage. O monstrous
   usurpation! O unknown rights of God! O the ingratitude and insolence of
   the creature! Miserable nothing! what hast thou to keep for thyself!
   What hast thou which belongs to thee? What hast thou which did not come
   from on high, and ought not to return thither? Everything, yea, even
   this I which would divide with God his gifts, is a gift of God, and was
   only made for Him; everything within thee cries out against thee and
   for thy Creator. Be still, then, thou who, having been created, wouldst
   deny thy Creator, and surrender thyself wholly to Him.

   But alas! O my God! what a consolation is it to know that everything
   within as well as without me, is the work of thy hand! Thou art ever
   with me. When I do wrong, Thou are within me, reproaching me with the
   evil which I do, raising within me regrets for the good which I
   abandon, and opening to me thine arms of mercy. When I do good, Thou
   inspirest the desire, and doest it in me and with me; it is Thou who
   lovest good and hatest evil in my heart, who sufferest and prayest, who
   doest good to the neighbor and givest alms: I do all these things but
   by thy means; Thou causest me to do them; it is Thou who puttest them
   in me. These good works, which are thy gifts, become my works; but they
   do not cease to be thy gifts; and they cease to be good works if I look
   at them for a moment as emanating from myself, or if I forget that they
   are good only because they come from Thee.

   Thou, then, (it is my delight to believe it!) art incessantly working
   within me; there Thou laborest invisibly like a miner in the bowels of
   the earth. Thou doest everything and yet the world beholds Thee not,
   attributes nothing to Thee; and even I myself wandered everywhere
   vainly searching for Thee outside of myself; I ran over all the wonders
   of nature that I might form some conception of thy greatness; I asked
   thy creatures of Thee and not once thought of finding Thee in the
   depths of my heart where Thou hadst never ceased to dwell. No, O my
   God! it is not necessary to descent into the depths nor to pass beyond
   the seas; it is not necessary to ascend into the heavens to find Thee;
   Thou art nearer to us than we are to ourselves.

   O my God! who art at once so great and so condescending, so high above
   the heavens and so accommodating to the misery of the creature, so
   infinite and so intimately enclosed in the depths of my heart, so
   terrible and so lovely, so jealous and so easy to be entreated of those
   who converse with Thee with the familiarity of pure love, when will thy
   children cease to be ignorant of Thee? Where shall I find a voice loud
   enough to reproach the whole world with its blindness, and to tell it
   with authority all that Thou art? When we bid men look for Thee in
   their own hearts, it is as though we bade them search for Thee in the
   remotest and most unknown lands! What territory is more distant or more
   unknown to the greater part of them, vain and dissipated as they are,
   than the ground of their own hearts? Do they ever know what it is to
   enter within themselves? Have they ever endeavored to find the way? Can
   they even form the most distant conception of the nature of that
   interior sanctuary, that impenetrable depth of the soul where Thou
   desirest to be worshipped in spirit and in truth? They are ever outside
   of themselves in the objects of their ambition or of their pleasure.
   Alas! how can they understand heavenly truths, since, as our Lord says,
   they cannot even comprehend those which are earthly? (John iii. 12.)
   They cannot conceive what it is to enter within themselves by serious
   reflexion; what would they say if they were told bid to come out of
   themselves that they might be lost in God?

   As for me, my Creator, I shut my eyes to all exterior things, which are
   but vanity and vexation of spirit, (Eccles. i. 14,) that I may enjoy in
   the deepest recesses of my heart an intimate companionship with Thee
   through Jesus Christ thy Son, who is thy Wisdom and Eternal
   Understanding. He became a child that by his childhood and the folly of
   his cross, he might put to shame our vain and lying wisdom. Cost what
   it may, and in spite of my fears and speculations, I desire to become
   lowly and a fool, still more despicable in my own eyes than in those of
   the wise in their own conceit. Like the apostles, I would become drunk
   with the Holy Spirit, and be content with them to become the sport of
   the world.

   I find Thee everywhere within. It is Thou that doest every good thing
   which I seem to do. I have a thousand times experienced that I could
   not of myself govern my temper, overcome my habits, subdue my pride,
   follow my reason nor will again the good which I had once willed. It is
   Thou that must both bestow the will and preserve it pure; without Thee
   I am but a reed shaken by the wind. Thou art the author of all the
   courage, the uprightness and the truth which I possess; Thou has given
   me a new heart which longs after thy righteousness, and which is
   athirst for thine eternal truth; Thou has taken away the old man full
   of filth and corruption, and which was jealous, vain, ambitious,
   restless, unrighteous and devoted to its own pleasure. In what a state
   of misery did I live. Ah! could I ever have believed that I should be
   enabled thus to turn to Thee, and shake off the yoke of my tyrannical
   passions?

   But, behold a marvel that eclipses all the rest! Who but Thee could
   ever have snatched me from myself, and turned all my hatred and
   contempt against mine own bosom? I have not done this; for it is not by
   our own power that we depart from self; no! Thou, O Lord, didst shine
   with thine own light into the depth of my heart which could not be
   reached by any other, and didst there reveal the whole of my foulness.
   I know that, even after beholding, I have not changed it; that I am
   still filthy in thy sight, that my eyes have not been able to discover
   the extent of my pollution; but I have, at least, seen a part, and I
   desire to behold the whole. I am despised in my own sight, but the hope
   that I have in Thee causes me to live in peace; for I will neither
   flatter my defects nor suffer them to discourage me. I take thy side, O
   God, against myself; it is only by thy strength that I am able to do
   this. Behold what hath God wrought within me! and Thou continuest thy
   work from day to day in cleansing me from the old Adam and in building
   up the new. This is the new creation which is gradually going on.

   I leave myself, Father, in thy hands; make and re-make this clay, shape
   it or grind it to atoms; it is thine own, it has nought to say; only
   let it always be subservient to thine ever-blessed designs, and let
   nothing in me oppose thy good pleasure for which I was created.
   Require, command, forbid; what wouldst Thou have me do? what not do?
   Exalted, or abased, rejoicing or suffering, doing thy work or laid
   aside, I will always praise Thee alike, ever yielding up all my own
   will to Thine! Nothing remains for me but to adopt the language of
   Mary: "Be it unto me according to thy words," (Luke i. 38.)

   Let me, O my God, stifle forever in my heart, every thought that would
   tempt me to doubt thy goodness. I know that Thou canst not but be good.
   O merciful Father! let me no longer reason about grace, but silently
   abandon myself to its operation. Grace performs everything in us, but
   does it with and through us; it is by it, therefore, that I act, that I
   forbear, that I suffer, that I wait, that I resist, that I believe,
   that I hope, and that I love, all in co-operation with grace. Following
   its guidance, it will do all things in me, and I shall do all things
   through it; it moves the heart, but the heart must move; there is no
   salvation without man's action. I must work, then, without losing a
   moment, that I may put no hinderance in the way of that grace which is
   incessantly working within me. All the good is of grace, all the evil
   is of self; when I do right, it is grace that does it; when I do wrong,
   it is because I resist grace. I pray God that I may not seek to know
   more than this; all else will but serve to nourish a presumptuous
   curiosity. O my God! keep me ever in the number of those babes to whom
   Thou revealest thy mysteries, while Thou concealest them from the wise
   and prudent!

   Thou causest me clearly to understand that Thou makest use of the evils
   and imperfections of the creature to do the good which thou hast
   determined beforehand. Thou concealest thyself under the importunate
   visitor, who intrudes upon the occupation of thy impatient child, that
   he may learn not to be impatient, and that he may die to the
   gratification of being free to study or work as he pleases. Thou
   availest thyself of slanderous tongues to destroy the reputation of
   thine innocent children, that, beside their innocence, they may offer
   Thee the sacrifice of their too highly-cherished reputation. By the
   cunning artifices of the envious, Thou layest low the fortunes of those
   whose were too much set upon their prosperity. It is thy hand that
   sends death upon him to whom life is a constant source of danger, and
   the tomb a harbor of refuge. It is Thou that makest his death a remedy,
   bitter enough, it is true, but effectual, for those who were too fondly
   attached to him, and thus, while saving one, by removing him from life,
   Thou preparest the others, by that very act, for a happy death. Thus
   Thou mercifully strewest bitterness over everything that is not
   Thyself, to the end that our hearts, formed to love Thee and to exist
   upon thy love, may be, as it were, constrained to return to Thee by a
   want of satisfaction in everything else.

   And this is because Thou art all Love, and consequently all Jealousy. O
   jealous God! (for thus art thou called!) a divided heart displeases
   Thee; a wandering one excites thy pity. Thou art infinite in all
   things, in love as well as in wisdom and power. Thou lovest like an
   infinite God when thou lovest; Thou movest heaven and earth to save thy
   loved ones; Thou becomest man, a babe, the vilest of men, covered with
   reproaches, dying with infamy and under the pangs of the cross; all
   this is not too much for an infinite love. Our finite love and limited
   wisdom cannot understand it; how should the finite comprehend the
   Infinite? it has neither eyes to see it nor a heart to take it in; the
   debased and narrowed soul of man and his vain wisdom are offended, and
   can perceive no trace of God in this excess of love. But for myself, it
   is by this very character of infinity that I recognize it: this is the
   love that does all things; that brings to pass even the evils we
   suffer, so shaping them that they are but the instruments of preparing
   the good which, as yet, has not arrived.

   But ah! when shall we return love for Love? When shall we seek Him who
   seeks us and constantly carries us in his arms? When He bears us along
   in his tender and paternal bosom, then it is that we forget Him; in the
   sweetness of his gifts, we forget the Giver; his ceaseless blessings,
   instead of melting us into love, distract our attention and turn it
   away from Him.
     __________________________________________________________________

  III. ON PURE LOVE.

   The Lord hath made all things for Himself (Prov. xvi. 4), says the
   Scripture; everything belongs to Him, and He will never release his
   right to anything. Free and intelligent creatures are his as much as
   those which are otherwise. He refers every unintelligent thing totally
   and absolutely to Himself, and He desires that his intelligent
   creatures should voluntarily make the same disposition of themselves.
   It is true that He desires our happiness, but that is neither the chief
   end of his work, nor an end to be compared with that of his glory. It
   is for his glory only that He wills our happiness; the latter is a
   subordinate consideration, which He refers to the final and essential
   end of his glory.

   That we may enter into his designs in this respect, we must prefer God
   before ourselves, and endeavor to will our own happiness for his glory;
   in any other case, we invert the order of things. And we must not
   desire his glory on account of our own salvation, but, on the other
   hand, the desire for his glory should impel us to seek our own
   happiness as a thing which He has been pleased to make a part of his
   glory. It is true that all holy souls are not capable of exercising
   this explicit preference for God over themselves, but there must at
   least be an implicit preference; the former, which is more perfect, is
   reserved for those whom God has endowed with light and strength to
   prefer Him to themselves, to such a degree as to desire their own
   happiness simply because it adds to his glory.

   Men have a great repugnance to this truth, and consider it to be a very
   hard saying, because they are lovers of self from self-interest. They
   understand, in a general and superficial way, that they must love God
   more than all his creatures, but they have no conception of loving God
   more than themselves, and loving themselves only for Him. They can
   utter these great words without difficulty, because they do not enter
   into their meaning, but they shudder when it is explained to them, that
   God and his glory are to be preferred before ourselves and everything
   else to such a degree that we must love his glory more than our own
   happiness, and must refer the latter to the former, as a subordinate
   means to an end.

  IV. ON PRAYER AND THE PRINCIPAL EXERCISES OF PIETY.

   1. True prayer is only another name for the love of God. Its excellence
   does not consist in the multitude of our words; for our Father knoweth
   what things we have need of before we ask Him. The true prayer is that
   of the heart, and the heart prays only for what it desires. To pray,
   then is to desire--but to desire what God would have us desire. He who
   asks what he does not from the bottom of his heart desire, is mistaken
   in thinking that he prays. Let him spend days in reciting prayers, in
   meditation or in inciting himself to pious exercises, he prays not once
   truly, if he really desire not the things he pretends to ask.

   2. O! how few there are who pray! for how few are they who desire what
   is truly good! Crosses, external and internal humiliation, renouncement
   of our own wills, the death of self and the establishment of God's
   throne upon the ruins of self love, these are indeed good; not to
   desire these, is not to pray; to desire them seriously, soberly,
   constantly, and with reference to all the details of life, this is true
   prayer; not to desire them, and yet to suppose we pray, is an illusion
   like that of the wretched who dream themselves happy. Alas! how many
   souls full of self, and of an imaginary desire for perfection in the
   midst of hosts of voluntary imperfections, have never yet uttered this
   true prayer of the heart! It is in reference to this that St. Augustine
   says: He that loveth little, prayeth little; he that loveth much,
   prayeth much.

   3. On the other hand, that heart in which the true love of God and true
   desire exist, never ceases to pray. Love, hid in the bottom of the
   soul, prays without ceasing, even when the mind is drawn another way.
   God continually beholds the desire which He has himself implanted in
   the soul, though it may at times be unconscious of its existence; his
   heart is touched by it; it ceaselessly attracts his mercies; it is that
   Spirit which, according to St. Paul, helpeth our infirmities and maketh
   intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. (Rom. viii.
   26.)

   4. Love desires of God that he would give us what we need, and that He
   would have less regard to our frailty than to the purity of our
   intentions. It even covers over our trifling defects, and purifies us
   like a consuming fire; "He maketh intercession for the Saints,
   according to the will of God. (Rom. viii. 27.) For "we know not what we
   should pray for as we ought," and, in our ignorance, frequently request
   what would be injurious; we should like fervor of devotion, distinct
   sensible joys and apparent perfections, which would serve to nourish
   within us the life of self and a confidence in our own strength; but
   love leads us on, abandons us to all the operations of grace, puts us
   entirely at the disposal of God's will, and thus prepares us for all
   his secret designs.

   5. Then we will all things and yet nothing. What God gives, is
   precisely what we should have desired to ask; for we will whatever He
   wills and only that. Thus, this state contains all prayer: it is a work
   of the heart which includes all desire. The Spirit prays within us for
   those very things which the Spirit himself wills to give us. Even when
   we are occupied with outward things, and our thoughts drawn off by the
   providential engagements of our position, we still carry within us a
   constantly burning fire, which not only cannot be extinguished, but
   nourishes a secret prayer, and is like a lamp continually lighted
   before the throne of God, "I sleep but my heart waketh." (Sol. Song v.
   2.) "Blessed are those servants, whom the Lord when he cometh, shall
   find watching." (Luke xii. 37.)

   6. There are two principal points of attention necessary for the
   preservation of this constant spirit of prayer which unites us with
   God: we must continually seek to cherish it, and we must avoid
   everything that tends to make us lose it.

   In order to cherish it, we should pursue a regulated course of reading;
   we must have appointed seasons of secret prayer, and frequent states of
   recollection during the day; we should make use of retirement when we
   feel the need of it, or when it is advised by those of greater
   experience, and unite in the ordinances appropriate to our condition.

   We should greatly fear and be exceedingly cautious to avoid all things
   that have a tendency to make us lose this state of prayer. Thus we
   should decline those worldly occupations and associates which dissipate
   the mind, pleasures which excite the passions, and everything
   calculated to awaken the love of the world and those old inclinations
   that have caused us so much trouble.

   There is an infinity of detail in these two heads; general directions
   only can be given, because each individual case presents features
   peculiar to itself.

   7. We should choose those works for reading which instruct us in our
   duty and in our faults; which, while they point out the greatness of
   God, teach us what is our duty to Him, and how very far we are from
   performing it; not those barren productions which melt and
   sentimentalize the heart; the tree must bear fruit; we can only judge
   of the life of the root by its fecundity.

   8. The first effect of a sincere love is an earnest desire to know all
   that we ought to do to gratify the object of our affection. Any other
   desire is a proof that we love ourselves under a pretence of loving
   God; that we are seeking an empty and deceitful consolation in Him;
   that we would use God as an instrument for our pleasure, instead of
   sacrificing that for his glory. God forbid that his children should so
   love Him! Cost what it may, we must both know and do without
   reservation what he requires of us.

   9. Seasons of secret prayer must be regulated by the leisure, the
   disposition, the condition, and the inward impulse of each individual.

   Meditation is not prayer, but it is its necessary foundation; it brings
   to mind the truths which God has revealed. We should be conversant not
   only with all the mysteries of Jesus Christ, and the truths of his
   Gospel, but also with everything they ought to operate in us for our
   regeneration; we should be colored and penetrated by them as wool is by
   the dye.

   10. So familiar should they become to us, that, in consequence of
   seeing them at all times and ever near to us, we may acquire the habit
   of forming no judgment except in their light; that they may be to us
   our only guide in matters of practice, as the rays of the sun are our
   only light in matters of perception.

   When these truths are once, as it were, incorporated in us, then it is
   that our praying begins to be real and fruitful. Up to that point it
   was but the shadow; we thought we had penetrated to the inmost recesses
   of the gospel, when we had barely set foot upon the vestibule--all our
   most tender and lively feelings, all our firmest resolutions, all our
   clearest and farthest views, were but the rough and shapeless mass from
   which God would hew in us his likeness.

   11. When his celestial rays begin to shine within us, then we see in
   the true light; then there is no truth to which we do not
   instantaneously assent, as we admit, without any process of reasoning,
   the splendor of the sun, the moment we behold his rising beams. Our
   union with God must be the result of our faithfulness in doing and
   suffering all his will.

   12. Our meditations should become every day deeper and more interior. I
   say deeper, because by frequent and humble meditation upon God's truth,
   we penetrate farther and farther in search of new treasures; and more
   interior, because as we sink more and more to enter into these truths,
   they also descend to penetrate the very substance of our souls. Then it
   is that a simple word goes farther than whole sermons.

   13. The very things which had been, fruitlessly and coldly, heard a
   hundred times before, now nourish the soul with a hidden manna, having
   an infinite variety of flavors for days in succession. Let us beware,
   too, of ceasing to meditate upon truths which have heretofore been
   blessed to us, so long as there remains any nourishment in them, so
   long as they yet yield us anything; it is a certain sign that we still
   need their ministration; we derive instruction from them without
   receiving any precise or distinct impression; there is an indescribable
   something in them, which helps us more than all our reasonings. We
   behold a truth, we love it and repose upon it; it strengthens the soul
   and detaches us from ourselves; let us dwell upon it in peace as long
   as possible.

   14. As to the manner of meditating, it should not be subtle, nor
   composed of long reasonings; simple and natural reflections derived
   immediately from the subject of our thoughts are all that is required.

   We need take a few truths; meditate upon these without hurry, without
   effort, and without seeking for far-fetched reflections.

   Every truth should be considered with reference to its practical
   bearing. To receive it without employing all means to put it faithfully
   in practice at whatever cost, is to desire "to hold the truth in
   unrighteousness" (Rom. i. 18); it is a resistance to the truth
   impressed upon us, and of course, to the Holy Spirit. This is the most
   terrible of all unfaithfulness.

   15. As to a method in prayer, each one must be guided by his own
   experience. Those who find themselves profited in using a strict
   method, need not depart from it, while those who cannot so confine
   themselves, may make use of their own mode, without ceasing to respect
   that which has been useful to many, and which so many pious and
   experienced persons have highly recommended. A method is intended to
   assist; if it be found to embarrass, instead of assisting, the sooner
   it is discarded the better.

   16. The most natural mode, at first, is to take a book, and to cease
   reading whenever we feel so inclined by the passage upon which we are
   engaged, and, whenever that no longer ministers to our interior
   nourishment, to begin again. As a general rule, those truths which we
   highly relish, and which shed a degree of practical light upon the
   things which we are required to give up for God, are leadings of Divine
   Grace, which we should follow without hesitation. The Spirit bloweth
   where it listeth, (John iii. 8,) and where the Spirit of the Lord is,
   there is liberty. (2 Cor. iii. 17.)

   In the course of time the proportion of reflections and reasonings will
   diminish, and that of tender feelings, affecting views and desires,
   will increase as we become sufficiently instructed and convinced by the
   Holy Spirit. The heart is satisfied, nourished, warmed, set on fire; a
   word only will give it employment for a long time.

   17. Finally, increase of prayer is indicated by an increase of
   simplicity and steadiness in our views, a great multitude of objects
   and considerations being no longer necessary. Our intercourse with God
   resembles that with a friend; at first, there are a thousand things to
   be told, and as many to be asked; but after a time, these diminish,
   while the pleasure of being together does not. Everything has been
   said, but the satisfaction of seeing each other, of feeling that one is
   near the other, or reposing in the enjoyment of a pure and sweet
   friendship, can be felt without conversation; the silence is eloquent
   and mutually understood. Each feels that the other is in perfect
   sympathy with him, and that their two hearts are incessantly poured one
   into the other, and constitute but one.

   18. Thus it is that in prayer, our communion with God becomes a simple
   and familiar union, far beyond the need of words. But let it be
   remembered that God himself must alone institute this prayer within us;
   nothing would be more rash nor more dangerous, than to dare to attempt
   it of ourselves. We must suffer ourselves to be led step by step, by
   some one conversant with the ways of God, who may lay the immovable
   foundations of correct teaching, and of the complete death of self in
   everything.

   19. As regards retirement and attending upon ordinances, we must be
   governed by the advice of some one in whom we have confidence. Our own
   necessities, the effect produced upon us, and many other circumstances,
   are to be taken into consideration.

   20. Our leisure and our needs must regulate our retirements; our needs,
   because it is with the soul as with the body; when we can no longer
   work without nourishment, we must take it; we shall otherwise be in
   danger of fainting. Our leisure, because, this absolute necessity of
   food excepted, we must attend to duty before we seek enjoyment in
   spiritual exercises. The man who has public duties and spends the time
   appropriate to them in meditating in retirement, would miss of God
   while he was seeking to be united to Him. True union with God is to do
   his will without ceasing, in spite of all our natural disinclination
   and in every duty of life, however disagreeable or mortifying.

   21. As precautions against wanderings we must avoid close and intimate
   intercourse with those who are not pious, especially when we have been
   before led astray by their infectious maxims. They will open our wounds
   afresh: they have a secret correspondence deep in our souls; there is
   there a soft and insinuating counsellor who is always ready to blind
   and deceive us.

   22. Would you judge of a man? says the Holy Spirit. (Prov. xiii. 20.)
   Observe who are his companions. How can he who loves God, and who loves
   nothing except in and for God, enjoy the intimate companionship of
   those who neither love, nor know God, and who look upon love to Him as
   a weakness? Can a heart full of God and sensible of its own frailty,
   ever rest, and be at ease with those who have no feelings in common
   with it, but are ever seeking to rob it of its treasure? Their
   delights, and the pleasures of which Faith is the source, are
   incompatible.

   23. I am well aware that we cannot, nay, that we ought not to break
   with those friends to whom we are bound by esteem of their natural
   amiability, by their services, by the tie of sincere friendship, or by
   the regard consequent upon mutual good offices. Friends whom we have
   treated with a certain familiarity and confidence, would be wounded to
   the quick, were we to separate from them entirely; we must gently and
   imperceptibly diminish our intercourse with them, without abruptly
   declaring our alteration of sentiment; we may see them in private,
   distinguish them from our less intimate friends, and confide to them
   those matters in which their integrity and friendship enable them to
   give us good advice, and to think with us, although our reasons for so
   thinking are more pure and elevated than theirs. In short, we may
   continue to serve them, and to manifest all the attentions of a cordial
   friendship, without suffering our hearts to be embarrassed by them.

   24. How perilous is our state without this precaution! If we do not,
   from the first, boldly adopt all measures to render our piety entirely
   free and independent of our unregenerate friends, it is threatened with
   a speedy downfall. If a man surrounded by such companions be of a
   yielding disposition and inflammable passions, it is certain that his
   friends, even the best-intentioned ones, will lead him astray. They may
   be good, honest, faithful, and possessed of all those qualities which
   render friendship perfect in the eye of the world; but, for him, they
   are infected, and their amiability only increases the danger. Those who
   have not this estimable character, should be sacrificed at once;
   blessed are we, when a sacrifice that ought to cost us so little, may
   avail to give us so precious a security for our eternal salvation!

   25. Not only, then, should we be exceedingly careful whom we will see,
   but we must also reserve the necessary time that we may see God alone
   in prayer. Those who have stations of importance to fill, have
   generally so many indispensable duties to perform, that without the
   greatest care in the management of their time, none will be left to be
   alone with God. If they have ever so little inclination for
   dissipation, the hours that belong to God and their neighbor disappear
   altogether.

   We must be firm in observing our rules. This strictness seems
   excessive, but without it everything falls into confusion; we become
   dissipated, relaxed and lose strength; we insensibly separate from God,
   surrender ourselves to all our pleasures, and only then begin to
   perceive that we have wandered, when it is almost hopeless to think of
   endeavoring to return.

   Prayer, prayer! this is our only safety. "Blessed be God which hath not
   turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me." (Ps. 116:20.) And to be
   faithful in prayer it is indispensable that we should dispose all the
   employments of the day, with a regularity nothing can disturb.
     __________________________________________________________________

  V. ON CONFORMITY TO THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.

   We must imitate Jesus; live as He lived, think as He thought, and be
   conformed to his image, which is the seal of our sanctification.

   What a contrast! Nothingness strives to be something, and the
   Omnipotent becomes nothing! I will be nothing with Thee, my Lord! I
   offer Thee the pride and vanity which have possessed me hitherto. Help
   Thou my will; remove from me occasions of my stumbling; turn away mine
   eyes from beholding vanity (Psalm cxviii. 37); let me behold nothing
   but Thee and myself in thy presence, that I may understand what I am
   and what Thou art.

   Jesus Christ was born in a stable; he was obliged to fly into Egypt;
   thirty years of his life were spent in a workshop; he suffered hunger,
   thirst, and weariness; he was poor, despised and miserable; he taught
   the doctrines of Heaven, and no one would listen. The great and the
   wise persecuted and took him, subjected him to frightful torments,
   treated him as a slave and put him to death between two malefactors,
   having preferred to give liberty to a robber, rather than to suffer him
   to escape. Such was the life which our Lord chose; while we are
   horrified at any kind of humiliation, and cannot bear the slightest
   appearance of contempt.

   Let us compare our lives with that of Jesus Christ, reflecting that he
   was the Master and that we are the servants; that He was all-powerful,
   and that we are but weakness; that he was abased and that we are
   exalted. Let us so constantly bear our wretchedness in mind, that we
   may have nothing but contempt for ourselves. With what face can we
   despise others, and dwell upon their faults, when we ourselves are
   filled with nothing else? Let us begin to walk in the path which our
   Saviour has marked out, for it is the only one that can lead us to Him.

   And how can we expect to find Jesus if we do not seek Him in the states
   of his earthly life, in loneliness and silence, in poverty and
   suffering, in persecution and contempt, in annihilation and the cross?
   The saints find him in heaven, in the splendors of glory and in
   unspeakable pleasures; but it is only after having dwelt with Him on
   earth in reproaches, in pain and in humiliation. To be a Christian is
   to be an imitator of Jesus Christ. In what can we imitate Him if not in
   his humiliation? Nothing else can bring us near to Him. We may adore
   him as Omnipotent, fear him as just, love him with all our heart as
   good and merciful,--but we can only imitate him as humble, submissive,
   poor and despised.

   Let us not imagine that we can do this by our own efforts; everything
   that is written is opposed to it; but we may rejoice in the presence of
   God. Jesus has chosen to be made partaker of all our weaknesses; He is
   a compassionate high-priest who has voluntarily submitted to be tempted
   in all points like as we are; let us, then, have all our strength in
   Him who became weak that he might strengthen us; let us enrich
   ourselves out of his poverty, confidently exclaiming, I can do all
   things through Christ which strengtheneth me. (Philip. iv. 13.)

   Let me follow in thy footsteps, O Jesus! I would imitate Thee, but
   cannot without the aid of thy grace! O humble and lowly Saviour, grant
   me the knowledge of the true Christian, and that I may willingly
   despise myself; let me learn the lesson, so incomprehensible to the
   mind of man, that I must die to myself by an abandonment that shall
   produce true humility.

   Let us earnestly engage in this work, and change this hard heart, so
   rebellious to the heart of Jesus Christ. Let us make some approaches
   toward the holy soul of Jesus; let Him animate our souls and destroy
   all our repugnances. O lovely Jesus! who hast suffered so many injuries
   and reproaches for my sake, let me esteem and love them for thine, and
   let me desire to share thy life of humiliation!
     __________________________________________________________________

  VI. ON HUMILITY.

   What a mercy is humiliation to a soul that receives it with a steadfast
   faith! There are a thousand blessings in it for ourselves and for
   others; for our Lord bestows his grace upon the humble. Humility
   renders us charitable towards our neighbor; nothing will make us so
   tender and indulgent to the faults of others as a view of our own.

   Two things produce humility when combined; the first is a sight of the
   abyss of wretchedness from which the all-powerful hand of God has
   snatched us, and over which he still holds us, as it were, suspected in
   the air, and the other is the presence of that God who is ALL.

   Our faults, even those most difficult to bear, will all be of service
   to us, if we make use of them for our humiliation, without relaxing our
   efforts to correct them. It does no good to be discouraged; it is the
   result of a disappointed and despairing self-love. The true method of
   profiting by the humiliation of our faults, is to behold them in all
   their deformity, without losing our hope in God, and without having any
   confidence in ourselves.

   We must bear with ourselves without either flattery or discouragement,
   a mean seldom attained; for we either expect great things of ourselves
   and of our good intentions, or wholly despair. We must hope nothing for
   self, but wait for everything from God. Utter despair of ourselves, in
   consequence of a conviction of our helplessness, and unbounded
   confidence in God, are the true foundations of the spiritual edifice.

   That is a false humility, which, acknowledging itself unworthy of the
   gifts of God, dares not confidently expect them; true humility consists
   in a deep view of our utter unworthiness, and in an absolute
   abandonment to God, without the slightest doubt that He will do the
   greatest things in us.

   Those who are truly humble, will be surprised to hear anything exalted
   of themselves. They are mild and peaceful, of a contrite and humble
   heart, merciful and compassionate; they are quiet, cheerful, obedient,
   watchful, fervent in spirit and incapable of strife; they always take
   the lowest place, rejoice when they are despised, and consider every
   one superior to themselves; they are lenient to the faults of others in
   view of their own, and very far from preferring themselves before any
   one. We may judge of our advancement in humility, by the delight we
   have in humiliations and contempt.
     __________________________________________________________________

  VII. ON PRAYER

   Many are tempted to believe that they no longer pray, when they cease
   to enjoy a certain pleasure in the act of prayer. But, if they will
   reflect that perfect prayer is only another name for love to God, they
   will be undeceived.

   Prayer, then, does not consist in sweet feelings, nor in the charms of
   an excited imagination, nor in that illumination of the intellect that
   traces with ease the sublimest truths in God; nor even in a certain
   consolation in the view of God: all these things are external gifts
   from his hand, in the absence of which, love may exist even more
   purely, as the soul may then attach itself immediately and solely to
   God, instead of to his mercies.

   This is that love by naked faith which is the death of nature, because
   it leaves it no support; and when we are convinced that all is lost,
   that very conviction is the evidence that all is gained.

   Pure love is in the will alone; it is no sentimental love, for the
   imagination has no part in it; it loves, if we may so express it,
   without feeling, as faith believes without seeing. We need not fear
   that this love is an imaginary thing--nothing can be less so than the
   mere will separate from all imagination: the more purely intellectual
   and spiritual are the operations of our minds, the nearer are they, not
   only to reality but to the perfection which God requires of us: their
   working is more perfect; faith is in full exercise while humility is
   preserved.

   Such love is chaste: for it is the love of God in and for God; we are
   attached to Him, but not for the pleasure which he bestows on us; we
   follow Him, but not for the loaves and fishes.

   What! some may say, can it be that a simple will to be united with God,
   is the whole of piety? How can we be assured that this will is not a
   mere idea, a trick of the imagination, instead of a true willing of the
   soul?

   I should indeed believe that it was a deception, if it were not the
   parent of faithfulness on all proper occasions; for a good tree
   bringeth forth good fruit; and a true will makes us truly earnest and
   diligent in doing the will of God; but it is still compatible in this
   life with little failings which are permitted by God that the soul may
   be humbled. If, then, we experience only these little daily frailties,
   let us not be discouraged, but extract from them their proper fruit,
   humility.

   True virtue and pure love reside in the will alone. Is it not a great
   matter always to desire the Supreme Good whenever He is seen; to keep
   the mind steadily turned towards Him, and to bring it back whenever it
   is perceived to wander; to will nothing advisedly but according to his
   order; in short, in the absence of all sensible enjoyment, still to
   remain the same in the spirit of a submissive, irreclaimable
   burnt-offering? Think you it is nothing to repress all the uneasy
   reflections of self-love; to press forward continually without knowing
   whither we go, and yet without stopping; to cease from self-satisfied
   thoughts of self, or at least, to think of ourselves as we would of
   another; to fulfill the indications of Providence for the moment, and
   no further? Is not this more likely to be the death of the Old Adam
   than fine sentiments, in which we are, in fact, thinking only of self,
   or external acts, in the performance of which we congratulate self on
   our advancement?

   It is a sort of infidelity to simple faith when we desire to be
   continually assured that we are doing well; it is, in fact, to desire
   to know what we are doing, which we shall never know, and of which it
   is the will of God that we should be ignorant. It is trifling by the
   way in order to reason about the way. The safest and shortest course is
   to renounce, forget and abandon self, and through faithfulness to God
   to think no more of it. This is the whole of religion--to get out of
   self and of self-love in order to get into God.

   As to involuntary wanderings, they are no hinderance to love, inasmuch
   as love is in the will, and the will only wanders when it wills to
   wander. As soon as we perceive that they have occurred, we drop them
   instantly and return to God, and thus, while the external senses of the
   spouse are asleep, the heart is watching; its love knows no
   intermission. A tender parent does not always bear his son distinctly
   in mind; he thinks and imagines a thousand things disconnected with
   him, but they do not interfere with the paternal affection; the moment
   that his thoughts rest again upon his child, he loves, and feels in the
   depths of his soul that though he has ceased to think of him he has not
   for an instant failed to love him. Such should be our love to our
   Heavenly Father; a love simple, trustful, confident and without
   anxiety.

   If our imagination take wing and our thoughts wander, let us not be
   perplexed; all these things are not that "hidden man of the heart in
   that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet
   spirit," of which St. Peter speaks. (1 Pet. iii. 4.) Let us only turn
   our thoughts, whenever we can, towards the face of the Well-beloved
   without being troubled at our wanderings. When He shall see fit to
   enable us to preserve a more constant sense of his presence with us, He
   will do so.

   He sometimes removes it for our advancement; it amuses us with too many
   reflections which are true distractions, diverting the mind from a
   simple and direct look toward God and withdrawing us from the shades of
   naked faith.

   We often seek in these reflections a resting-place for our self-love
   and consolation in the testimony we endeavor to extract from them for
   self; and thus the warmth of our feelings causes us to wander. On the
   contrary, we never pray so purely as when we are tempted to believe
   that we do not pray at all; we fear that we pray ill, but we should
   only fear being left to the desolation of sinful nature, to a
   philosophical infidelity, seeking perpetually a demonstration of its
   own operations in faith; in short, to impatient desires for consolation
   in sight and feeling.

   There is no more bitter penance than this state of pure faith without
   sensible support; and hence it seems to me the most effective, the most
   crucifying, and the least illusive. Strange temptation! We look
   impatiently for sensible consolation from the fear of not being
   penitent enough! Ah! why do we not consider the renouncement of that
   consolation which we are so strongly tempted to seek, as a proof of our
   penitence? Remember our Lord abandoned by his Father on the cross: all
   feeling, all reflection withdrawn that his God might be hidden from
   him; this was indeed the last blow that fell upon the man of sorrows,
   the consummation of the sacrifice!

   Never should we so abandon ourselves to God as when He seems to abandon
   us. Let us enjoy light and consolation when it is his pleasure to give
   it to us, but let us not attach ourselves to his gifts, but to Him; and
   when He plunges us into the night of Pure Faith, let us still press on
   through the agonizing darkness.

   Moments are worth days in this tribulation; the soul is troubled and
   yet at peace; not only is God hidden from it, but it is hidden from
   itself, that all may be of faith; it is discouraged, but feels
   nevertheless an immovable will to bear all that God may choose to
   inflict; it wills all, accepts all, even the troubles that try its
   faith, and thus in the very height of the tempest, the waters beneath
   are secretly calm and at peace, because its Will is one with God's.
   Blessed be the Lord who performeth such great things in us,
   notwithstanding our unworthiness!

  VIII. ON MEDITATION.

   When the solid foundations of a perfect conversion of heart, a
   scrupulous repentance and a serious meditation of all the Christian
   virtues have been laid, both theoretically and practically, we become
   gradually so accustomed to these truths, that we regard them at last
   with a simple and steady look, without the necessity of going back to
   examine and convince ourselves of each of them in detail. They are then
   all embraced in a certain enjoyment of God, so pure and so intimate,
   that we find everything in Him. It is no longer the intellect that
   examines and reasons; it is the will which loves and plunges into the
   infinite Good.

   But this is not your state. You must walk for a long while in the way
   of the sinners who are beginning to seek God; ordinary meditation is
   your lot, too happy that God condescends to admit you to it.

   Walk then in the spirit, like Abraham, without knowing whither you go;
   be content with your daily bread, and remember that in the desert the
   manna of to-day could not be preserved until to-morrow without
   corrupting. The children of God must be shut up to the grace of the
   present moment, without desiring to foresee the designs of Providence
   concerning them.

   Meditate, then, since now is your opportunity, upon all the mysteries
   of Jesus Christ and upon all the Gospel truths which you have for so
   long a time ignored and rejected. When God shall have entirely effaced
   from your mind the impression of all your worldly maxims, and the
   Spirit shall have left there no trace of your old prejudices, then it
   will be necessary to ascertain the direction in which you are attracted
   by grace, and to follow step by step without anticipating.

   In the meantime, dwell in peace in the bosom of God, like a little
   child on the breast of its mother; be satisfied with thinking on your
   chosen subject simply and easily; suffer yourself to be led gently to
   the truths which affect you, and which you find to nourish your heart.
   Avoid all exertions that excite the intellect, which often tempt us to
   believe that there is more piety in a dangerous vivacity of the
   imagination, than in a pure and upright intention of abandonment to
   God. Avoid likewise all refined speculation; confine yourself to simple
   reflections, and recur to them frequently. Those who pass too rapidly
   from one truth to another, feed their curiosity and restlessness; they
   even distract their intellect by too great a multiplicity of views.

   Give every truth time to send down deep roots into the heart; the main
   point is--to love. Nothing gives rise to such severe fits of
   indigestion as eating too much and too hastily. Digest every truth
   leisurely, if you would extract the essence of it for your nourishment,
   but let there be no restless self-reflective acts. Be sure that your
   exercise will not be acceptable unless performed without agitation or
   tumult.

   I am well aware that you will have distractions enough; bear them
   without impatience, dismiss them and recur quietly to your subject as
   soon as you perceive that your imagination has wandered. In this way
   these involuntary distractions will produce no injurious effects, and
   the patience with which you bear them without being discouraged, will
   advance you farther than a more continuous meditation, in which you
   might take more self-satisfaction. The true method of conquering
   wandering thoughts, is never to attack them directly with bitterness,
   and never to be discouraged by their frequency or duration.

   Suffer yourself, then, to be quietly occupied by the subject you have
   chosen; only let the exercise be as holy as you can make it, to which
   end take the following directions:

   Do not encumber yourself with a great number of thoughts upon a
   subject; but dwell upon each sufficiently long to allow it to afford
   its proper nourishment to the heart. You will gradually become
   accustomed to regard each truth steadily by itself, without flitting
   from one to another; this habit will serve to fix them deeply in your
   soul. You will thus, also, acquire a habit of dwelling upon your themes
   with pleasure and peaceful acquiescence, instead of considering them
   rapidly and intellectually as most persons do. Thus the foundations
   will be firmly laid for all that God intends to do in you; he will thus
   mortify the natural activity of the mind, that ever inclines it to seek
   novelties, instead of deeply imprinting the truths already in some
   degree familiar. You must not, however, forcibly restrain your mind to
   a subject which no longer seems to afford any nourishment; I would
   advise only that you should not abandon it so long as it still
   ministers food.

   As to your affections, retain all which the view of your subject
   naturally and quietly induces; but do not attempt to stir yourself up
   to great efforts, for they will exhaust and agitate you, and even cause
   aridities; they will occupy you too much with your own exertions, and
   implant a dangerous confidence in your own power; in short, they will
   attach you too firmly to sensible pleasures, and will thus prepare you
   great trouble in a time of dryness. Be content, then, to follow with
   simplicity, and without too many reflections, the emotions which God
   shall excite in view of your subject, or of any other truth. As for
   higher things, have no thoughts of them; there is a time for
   everything, and it is of the greatest importance that nothing should be
   precipitated.

   One of the cardinal rules of the spiritual life is, that we are to live
   exclusively in the present moment, without casting a look beyond. You
   remember that the Israelites in the desert followed the pillar of fire,
   or of cloud, without knowing whither it was leading them; they had a
   supply of manna but for one day; all above that became useless. There
   is no necessity now for moving rapidly; think only of laying a solid
   foundation; see that it is deep and broad by an absolute renunciation
   of self, and by an abandonment without reserve to the requirements of
   God. Let God, then, raise upon this foundation such a building as He
   pleases. Shut your eyes and commit yourself to Him. How wonderful is
   this walking with Abraham in pure faith, not knowing whither we go! and
   how full of blessings is the path!

   God will then be your guide; He himself will travel with you, as we are
   told He did with the Israelites, to bring them step by step across the
   desert to the promised land. Ah! what will be your blessedness if you
   will but surrender yourself into the hands of God, permitting him to do
   whatever He will, not according to your desires, but according to His
   own good pleasure!
     __________________________________________________________________

  IX. ON MORTIFICATION.

   God calls us hourly and momentarily to the exercise of mortification;
   but nothing can be more false than the maxim that we should always
   choose that which mortifies us the most. Such a plan would soon destroy
   our health, our reputation, our business, our intercourse with our
   relatives and friends, and the good works which Providence requires of
   us. I have no hesitation in saying that we ought to avoid certain
   things which experience has shown us to injure our health, such as
   certain kinds of food, etc. This course will, no doubt, spare us some
   suffering; but it does not tend to pamper the body nor require the
   employment of expensive or delicious substitutes; on the contrary, it
   conduces to a sober, and, therefore, in many respects, mortified life.

   Failures in regimen are owing to a want of mortification; they are not
   due either to courage in enduring pain, or to indifference to life, but
   to a weak hankering for pleasure, and impatience of anything that
   annoys. Submitting to regimen for the purpose of preserving health, is
   a great constraint; we would much rather suffer and be sick, than be
   constantly restraining our appetites; we love liberty and pleasure more
   than health. But God arranges all that in the heart which is devoted to
   Him; He causes us to fall in quietly with every regulation, and takes
   away a certain want of pliability in the will, and a dangerous
   confidence in ourselves; He blunts the desires, cools the passions, and
   detaches the man, not only from exterior things, but from self, renders
   him mild, amiable, simple, lowly, ready to will or not, according to
   His good pleasure. Let it be so with us; God desires it, and is ready
   to effect it; let us not resist his will. The mortification which comes
   in the order of God, is more serviceable than any enjoyment in devotion
   which should result from our own affection and choice.

   In regard to austerities, every one must regard his attraction, his
   state, his need and his temperament. A simple mortification, consisting
   in nothing more than an unshaken fidelity in providential crosses, is
   often far more valuable than severe austerities which render the life
   more marked, and tempt to a vain self-complacency. Whoever will refuse
   nothing which comes in the order of God, and seek nothing out of that
   order, need never fear to finish his day's work without partaking of
   the cross of Jesus Christ. There is an indispensable Providence for
   crosses as well as for the necessities of life; they are a part of our
   daily bread; God never will suffer it to fail. It is sometimes a very
   useful mortification to certain fervent souls, to give up their own
   plans of mortification, and adopt with cheerfulness those which are
   momentarily revealed in the order of God.

   When a soul is not faithful in providential mortifications, there is
   reason to fear some illusion in those which are sought through the
   fervor of devotion; such warmth is often deceitful, and it seems to me
   that a soul in this case would do well to examine its faithfulness
   under the daily crosses allotted by Providence.

  X. ON SELF-ABANDONMENT.

   If you would fully comprehend the meaning of self-abandonment, [1]
   recall the interior difficulty which you felt, and which you very
   naturally testified when I directed you always to count as nothing this
   self which is so dear to us. To abandon one's self is to count one's
   self as nought; and he who has perceived the difficulty of doing it,
   has already learned what that renunciation is, which so revolts our
   nature. Since you have felt the blow, it is evident that it has fallen
   upon the sore spot in your heart; let the all-powerful hand of God work
   in you as he well knows how, to tear you from yourself.

   The origin of our trouble is, that we love ourselves with a blind
   passion that amounts to idolatry. If we love anything beyond, it is
   only for our own sakes. We must be undeceived respecting all those
   generous friendships, in which it appears as though we so far forgot
   ourselves as to think only of the interests of our friend. If the
   motive of our friendship be not low and gross, it is nevertheless still
   selfish; and the more delicate, the more concealed, and the more proper
   in the eyes of the world it is, the more dangerous does it become, and
   the more likely to poison us by feeding our self-love.

   In those friendships which appear, both to ourselves and to the world,
   so generous and disinterested, we seek, in short, the pleasure of
   loving without recompense, and by the indulgence of so noble a
   sentiment, of raising ourselves above the weak and sordid of our race.
   Besides the tribute which we pay to our own pride, we seek from the
   world the reputation of disinterestedness and generosity; we desire to
   be loved by our friends, although we do not desire to be served by
   them; we hope that they will be charmed with what we do for them
   without any expectation of return; and in this way we get that very
   return which we seem to despise: for what is more delicious to a
   delicate self-love, than to hear itself applauded for not being
   self-love?

   You may have seen some one who seemed to think of every one but
   himself, who was the delight of good people, who was well disciplined,
   and seemed entirely forgetful of self. The self-oblivion is so great
   that self-love even would imitate it, and finds no glory equal to that
   of seeming to seek none at all. This moderation and self-renunciation
   which, if genuine, would be the death of nature, become, on the other
   hand, the most subtle and imperceptible food of a pride which despises
   all ordinary forms of glory, and desires only that which is to be
   secured by trampling under foot all the gross objects of ambition which
   captivate ordinary minds.

   But it is not a difficult matter to unmask this modest arrogance--this
   pride which seems no pride at all, so much does it appear to have
   renounced all the ordinary objects of desire. Condemn it and it cannot
   bear to be found fault with; let those whom it loves fail to repay it
   with friendship, esteem, and confidence, and it is stung to the quick.
   It is easy to see that it is not disinterested, though it tries so hard
   to seem so: it does not indeed accept payment in as gross coin as
   others; it does not desire insipid praise, or money, or that good
   fortune which consists in office and dignities. It must be paid,
   nevertheless; it is greedy of the esteem of good people; it loves that
   it may be loved again and be admired for its disinterestedness; it
   seems to forget self, that, by that means, it may draw the attention of
   the whole world upon self alone.

   It does not, indeed, make all these reflections in full detail; it does
   not say in so many words, I will deceive the whole world with my
   generosity, in order that the world may love and admire me; no, it
   would not dare to address such a gross and unworthy language to itself;
   it deceives itself with the rest of the world; it admires itself in its
   generosity, as a belle admires her beauty in a mirror; it is affected
   by perceiving that it is more generous and more disinterested than the
   rest of mankind; the illusion it prepares for others extends to itself;
   it passes with itself for what it passes itself upon others, that is,
   for generosity, and this is what pleases it more than anything else.

   However little we may have looked within to study the occasions of our
   pleasure and our grief, we shall have no difficulty in admitting that
   pride, as it is more or less delicate, has various tastes. But give it
   what taste you will, it is still pride; and that which appears the most
   restrained and the most reasonable is the most devilish; in esteeming
   itself, it despises others; it pities those who are pleased with
   foolish vanities; it recognizes the emptiness of greatness and rank; it
   cannot abide those who are intoxicated with good fortune; it would, by
   its moderation, be above fortune, and thus raise itself to a new
   height, by putting under foot all the false glory of men; like Lucifer,
   it would become like to the Most High. It would be a sort of divinity,
   above all human passions and interests, and it does not perceive that
   it seeks to place itself above men by this deceitful pride which blinds
   it.

   We may be sure, then, that it is the love of God only that can make us
   come out of self. If his powerful hand did not sustain us, we should
   not know how to take the first step in that direction.

   There is no middle course; we must refer everything either to God or to
   self; if to self, we have no other God than self; if to God, we are
   then in order, and regarding ourselves only as one among the other
   creatures of God, without selfish interests, and with a single eye to
   accomplish his will, we enter into that self-abandonment which you
   desire so earnestly to understand.

   But let me say again, that nothing will so shut your heart against the
   grace of abandonment, as that philosophic pride and self love in the
   disguise of worldly generosity, of which you should be especially in
   fear, on account of your natural disposition towards it. The greater
   our inherent endowment of frankness, disinteredness, pleasure in doing
   good, delicacy of feeling, love of honor, and generous friendship, the
   more lively should be our distrust of self, and our fear lest we take
   complacency in these gifts of nature.

   The reason why no creature can draw us out of ourselves is, that there
   is none that deserves to be preferred before ourselves. There is none
   which has the right so to detach us, nor the perfection which would be
   necessary to unite us to them without reference to ourselves, nor the
   power to satisfy the soul in such an attachment. Hence it is that we
   love nothing out of ourselves, except for the reference it has to self;
   we choose under the direction of our coarse and brutal passions, if we
   are low and boorish, or under the guidance of a refined desire for
   glory, if we are so delicate as not to be satisfied with what is gross
   and vulgar.

   But God does two things, which He only has the power to do. He reveals
   himself to us, with all his rights over the creature, and in all the
   charms of his goodness. Then we feel that, not having made ourselves,
   we are not made for ourselves; that we are created for the glory of Him
   whom it has pleased to form us; that He is too great to make anything
   except for Himself, and that thus all our perfection and our happiness
   should be to be lost in Him.

   This is what no created thing, dazzling though it may be, can make us
   realize in respect to itself. Far from finding in them that infinity
   which so fills and transports us in God, we discover only a void, a
   powerlessness to fill our hearts, an imperfection that continually
   drives us into ourselves.

   The second miracle which God works is, to operate in our hearts that
   which He pleases, after having enlightened our understanding. He is not
   satisfied with having displayed his own charms; He makes us love Him by
   producing, by his grace, his love in our hearts; and He thus himself
   performs within us, what He makes us see we owe to Him.

   You desire, perhaps, to know more in detail in what this
   self-abandonment consists. I will endeavor to satisfy you.

   There is little difficulty in comprehending that we must reject
   criminal pleasures, unjust gains, and gross vanities, because the
   renouncement of these things consists in a contempt which repudiates
   them absolutely, and forbids our deriving any enjoyment from them; but
   it is not so easy to understand that we must abandon property honestly
   acquired, the pleasures of a modest and well-spent life, and the honors
   derivable from a good reputation, and a virtue which elevates us above
   the reach of envy.

   The reason why we do not understand that these things must be given up,
   is, that we are not required to discard them with dislike, but, on the
   contrary, to preserve them to be used according to the station in which
   the Divine Providence places us.

   We have need of the consolation of a mild and peaceful life, to console
   us under its troubles; in respect to honors, we must regard "that which
   is convenient," and we must keep the property we possess to supply our
   wants. How then are we to renounce these things at the very moment when
   we are occupied in the care of preserving them? We are, moderately and
   without inordinate emotion, to do what is in our power to retain them,
   in order to make a sober use of them, without desiring to enjoy them or
   placing our hearts upon them.

   I say, a sober use of them, because, when we are not attached to a
   thing for the purposes of self-enjoyment and of seeking our happiness
   in it, we use only so much of it as we are necessarily obliged to; as
   you may see a wise and faithful steward study to appropriate only so
   much of his master's property as is precisely requisite to meet his
   necessary wants.

   The abandonment of evil things then, consists in refusing them with
   horror; of good things, in using them with moderation for our
   necessities, continually studying to retrench all those imaginary wants
   with which greedy nature would flatter herself.

   Remember that we must not only renounce evil, but also good things; for
   Jesus has said, "Whatsoever he be of you that forsaketh not all he
   hath, he cannot be my disciple." (Luke xiv. 33.)

   It follows, then, that the Christian must abandon everything that he
   has, however innocent; for, if he do not renounce it, it ceases to be
   innocent.

   He must abandon those things which it is his duty to guard with the
   greatest possible care, such as the good of his family, or his own
   reputation, for he must have his heart on none of these things; he must
   preserve them for a sober and moderate use; in short, he must be ready
   to give them all up whenever it is the will of Providence to deprive
   him of them.

   He must give up those whom he loves best, and whom it is his duty to
   love; and his renouncement of them consists in this, that he is to love
   them for God only; to make use of the consolation of their friendship
   soberly, and for the supply of his wants; to be ready to part with them
   whenever God wills it, and never to seek in them the true repose of his
   heart. This is that chastity of true Christian friendship which seeks
   in the mortal and earthly friend, only the heavenly spouse. It is thus
   that we use the world and the creature as not abusing them, according
   to Saint Paul. (1 Cor. vii. 31.) We do not desire to take pleasure in
   them; we only use what God gives us, what he wills that we should love,
   and what we accept with the reserve of a heart, receiving it only for
   necessity's sake, and keeping itself for a more worthy object.

   It is in this sense that Christ would have us leave father and mother,
   brothers and sisters, and friends, and that he is come to bring a sword
   upon earth.

   God is a jealous God; if, in the recesses of your soul, you are
   attached to any creature, your heart is not worthy of Him: He must
   reject it as a spouse that divides her affections between her
   bridegroom and a stranger.

   Having abandoned everything exterior, and which is not self, it remains
   to complete the sacrifice by renouncing everything interior, including
   self.

   The renouncement of the body is frightful to most delicate and
   worldly-minded persons. They know nothing, so to speak, that is more
   themselves than this body, which they flatter and adorn with so much
   care; and even when deprived of its graces, they often retain a love
   for its life amounting to a shameful cowardice, so that the very name
   of death makes them shudder.

   Your natural courage raises you above these fears, and I think I hear
   you say, I desire neither to flatter my body, nor to hesitate in
   consenting to its destruction, whenever it shall be the will of God to
   waste and consume it to ashes.

   You may thus renounce the body, and yet there may remain great
   obstacles in the way of your renouncing the spirit. The more we are
   able, by the aid of our natural courage, to despise the clay tenement,
   the more apt are we to set a higher value upon that which it contains,
   by the aid of which we are enabled to look down upon it.

   We feel towards our understanding, our wisdom, and our virtue, as a
   young and worldly woman feels towards her beauty. We take pleasure in
   them; it gives us a satisfaction to feel that we are wise, moderate,
   and preserved from the excitement which we see in others; we are
   intoxicated with the pleasure of not being intoxicated with pleasure;
   we renounce with courageous moderation the most flattering temptations
   of the world, and content us with the satisfaction derived from a
   conviction of our self-control.

   What a dangerous state! What a subtle poison! How recreant are you to
   God, if you yield your heart to this refinement of self-love! You must
   renounce all satisfaction and all natural complacency in your own
   wisdom and virtue.

   Remember, the purer and more excellent the gifts of God, the more
   jealous He is of them.

   He showed mercy to the first human rebel, and denied it to the angels.
   Both sinned by the love of self, but as the angel was perfect, and
   regarded as a sort of divinity, God punished his unfaithfulness with a
   fiercer jealousy than He did man's disobedience. We may infer from
   this, that God is more jealous of his most excellent gifts than He is
   of the more common ones; He would have us attached to nothing but
   Himself, and to regard his gifts, however excellent, as only the means
   of uniting us more easily and intimately to Him. Whoever contemplates
   the grace of God with a satisfaction and sort of pleasure of ownership,
   turns it into poison.

   Never appropriate exterior things to yourself then, such as favor or
   talents, nor even things the most interior. Your good will is no less a
   gift of God's mercy, than the life and being which you receive direct
   from his hands. Live, as it were, on trust; all that is in you, and all
   that you are, is only loaned you; make use of it according to the will
   of Him who lends it, but never regard it for a moment as your own.

   Herein consists true self-abandonment; it is this spirit of
   self-divesting, this use of ourselves and of ours with a single eye to
   the movements of God, who alone is the true proprietor of his
   creatures.

   You will desire to know, probably, what should be the practice of this
   renouncement in detail. But I answer that the feeling is no sooner
   established in the interior of the soul, than God himself will take you
   by the hand, that you may be exercised in self-renunciation in every
   event of every day.

   Self-abandonment is not accomplished by means of painful reflections
   and continual struggles; it is only by refraining from
   self-contemplation, and from desiring to master ourselves in our own
   way, that we lose ourselves in God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1] The terms abandonment, annihilation and death of itself, and the
   correlative expressions, union with God, oneness, and others of similar
   import, are frequently used by writers on the higher life, as a most
   concise and convenient form of designating a state of experience
   indicated throughout the New Testament, by such texts as the following:
   "Wherefore, if ye be dead with Christ," etc. (Col. ii. 20.) "If ye then
   be risen with Christ, etc. (Col. iii. 1.) "For ye are dead and your
   life is hid with Christ in God." (Col. iii. 3.) "And they that are
   Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts." Gal.
   v. 24.) "For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of
   his good pleasure." Phil. ii. 13.) "That they all may be one: as Thou,
   Father, art one in me and I in Thee, that they also may be one in us."
   (John xvii. 21.) It has been objected by some, that this abnegation of
   self, recommended in such glowing terms by these pious authors,
   involved two exceedingly dangerous errors. That on the one hand it
   necessarily implied an abandonment and loss of our identity, by a sort
   of Pagan transfusion into God, and on the other , that it bordered
   upon, if it did not constitute, a very pernicious form of
   perfectionism, in that it made God the author of all our willing and
   doing whatever their moral character. It can scarcely be necessary to
   say to any one who has made himself familiar with the subject, that
   such doctrines would be a melancholy perversion of the teachings of the
   writers in question. By the death of self, and annihilation of the
   will, they simply mean to express, in the strongest manner possible,
   that the soul, on every occasion, and under all circumstances, wills
   only what God wills, retaining perfectly its identity, and of course,
   its power to will. By union with, or absorption into God, they intend
   to convey the idea of the state of Oneness referred to by Christ,
   wherein the soul is made partaker of the perfect Holiness of God; but
   none are more earnest in insisting that the smallest appearance of evil
   is unanswerable evidence that such an attainment is still at a
   distance. By their fruits ye shall know them, is constantly asserted to
   be the inexorable standard of judgment for this, as for all other
   states of experience.-Editor.

  XI. ON TEMPTATIONS.

   I know of but two resources against temptations. One is, faithfully to
   follow the interior light in sternly and immediately cutting off
   everything we are at liberty to dismiss, and which may excite or
   strengthen the temptation. I say everything which we are at liberty to
   dismiss, because we are not always permitted to avoid the occasions of
   evil. Such as are unavoidable connected with the particular position in
   which Providence has placed us, are not considered to be within our
   power.

   The other expedient consists in turning towards God in every
   temptation, without being disturbed or anxious to know if we have not
   already yielded a sort of half consent, and without interrupting our
   immediate recourse to God. By examining too closely whether we have not
   been guilty of some unfaithfulness, we incur the risk of being again
   entangled in the temptation. The shortest and surest way is to act like
   a little child at the breast; when we show it a frightful monster, it
   shrinks back and buries its face in its mother's bosom, that it may no
   longer behold it.

   The sovereign remedy is the habit of dwelling continually in the
   presence of God. He sustains, consoles, and calms us.

   We must never be astonished at temptations, be they never so
   outrageous. On this earth all is temptation. Crosses tempt us by
   irritating our pride, and prosperity by flattering it. Our life is a
   continual combat, but one in which Jesus Christ fights for us. We must
   pass on unmoved, while temptations rage around us, as the traveller,
   overtaken by a storm, simply wraps his cloak more closely about him,
   and pushes on more vigorously towards his destined home.

   If the thought of former sins and wretchedness should be permitted to
   come before us, we must remain confounded and abashed before God,
   quietly enduring in his adorable presence all the shame and ignominy of
   our transgressions. We must not, however, seek to entertain or to call
   up so dangerous a recollection.

   In conclusion, it may be said that in doing what God wills, there is
   very little to be done by us; and yet there is a wonderful work to be
   accomplished, no less than that of reserving nothing, and making no
   resistance for a moment, to that jealous love, which searches
   inexorably into the most secret recesses of the soul for the smallest
   trace of self, for the slightest intimations of an affection of which
   itself is not the author. So, on the other hand, true progress does not
   consist in a multitude of views, nor in austerities, trouble and
   strife; it is simply willing nothing and everything, without
   reservation and without choice, cheerfully performing each day's
   journey as Providence appoints it for us; seeking nothing, refusing
   nothing; finding everything in the present moment, and suffering God,
   who does everything, to do his pleasure in and by us, without the
   slightest resistance. O how happy is he who has attained to this state!
   and how full of good things is his soul, when it appears emptied of
   everything!

   Let us pray the Lord to open to us the whole infinitude of his paternal
   heart, that our own may be there submerged and lost, so that it may
   make but one with His! Such was the desire of Paul for the faithful,
   when he longed for them in the bowels of Jesus Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

  XII. ON WANDERING THOUGHTS AND DEJECTION.

   1. Two things trouble you; one is, how you may avoid wandering
   thoughts; the other, how you may be sustained against dejection. As to
   the former, you will never cure them by set reflections; you must not
   expect to do the work of grace by the resources and activity of nature.
   Be simply content to yield your will to God without reservation; and
   whenever any state of suffering is brought before you, accept it as his
   will, in an absolute abandonment to his guidance.

   Do not go out in search of these crucifixions, but when God permits
   them to reach you without your having sought them, they need never pass
   without your deriving profit from them.

   Receive everything that God presents to your mind, notwithstanding the
   shrinking of nature, as a trial by which He would exercise and
   strengthen your faith. Never trouble yourself to inquire whether you
   will have strength to endure what is presented, if it should actually
   come upon you, for the moment of trial will have its appointed and
   sufficient grace; that of the present moment is to behold the
   afflictions presented tranquilly, and to feel willing to receive them
   whenever it should be the will of God to bestow them.

   Go on cheerfully and confidently in this trust. If this state of the
   will should not change in consequence of a voluntary attachment to
   something out of the will of God, it will continue forever.

   Your imagination will doubtless wander to a thousand matters of vanity;
   it will be subject to more or less agitation, according to your
   situation and the character of the objects presented to its regard. But
   what matter? The imagination, as St. Theresa declares, is the fool of
   the household; it is constantly busy in making some bustle or other, to
   distract the mind which cannot avoid beholding the images which it
   exhibits. The attention is inevitable, and is a true distraction, but,
   so long as it is involuntary, it does not separate us from God; nothing
   can do that but some distraction of the will.

   You will never have wandering thoughts if you never will to have them,
   and may then say with truth that you have prayed without ceasing.
   Whenever you perceive that you have involuntarily strayed away, return
   without effort, and you will tranquilly find God again without any
   disturbance of soul. As long as you are not aware of it, it is no
   wandering of the heart; when it is made manifest, look to God at once
   with fidelity, and you will find that this simple faithfulness to Him
   will be the occasion of blessing you with his more constant and more
   familiar indwelling.

   A frequent and easy recollection is one of the fruits of this faithful
   readiness to leave all wanderings as soon as they are perceived; but it
   must not be supposed that it can be accomplished by our own labors.
   Such efforts would produce trouble, scrupulosity, and restlessness in
   all those matters in which you have most occasion to be free. You will
   be constantly dreading lest you should lose the presence of God and
   continually endeavoring to recover it; you will surround yourself with
   the creations of your own imagination, and thus, the presence of God,
   which ought, by its sweetness and illumination, to assist us in
   everything which comes before us in his providence, will have the
   effect of keeping us always in a tumult, and render us incapable of
   performing the exterior duties of our condition.

   Be never troubled, then, at the loss of the sensible presence of God;
   but, above all, beware of seeking to retain Him by a multitude of
   argumentative and reflective acts. Be satisfied during the day, and
   while about the details of your daily duties, with a general and
   interior view of God, so that if asked, at any moment, whither your
   heart is tending, you may answer with truth that it is toward God,
   though the attention of your mind may then be engrossed by something
   else. Be not troubled by the wanderings of your imagination which you
   cannot restrain; how often do we wander through the fear of wandering
   and the regret that we have done so! What would you say of a traveller
   who, instead of constantly advancing in his journey, should employ his
   time in anticipating the falls which he might suffer, or in weeping
   over the place where one had happened? On! on! you would say to him,
   on! without looking behind or stopping. We must proceed, as the Apostle
   bids us, that we may abound more and more. (1 Thess. iv. 1.) The
   abundance of the love of God will be of more service in correcting us
   than all our restlessness and selfish reflections.

   This rule is simple enough; but nature, accustomed to the intricacies
   of reasoning and reflection, considers it as altogether too simple. We
   want to help ourselves, and to communicate more impulse to our
   progress; but it is the very excellency of the precept that it confines
   us to a state of naked faith, sustained by God alone in our absolute
   abandonment to Him, and leads us to the death of self by stifling all
   remains of it whatever. In this way we shall not be led to increase the
   external devotional practices of such as are exceedingly occupied, or
   are feeble in body, but shall be contented with turning them all into
   simple love; thus, we shall only act as constrained by love, and shall
   never be overburdened, for we shall only do what we love to do.

   2. Dejection often arises from the fact that, in seeking God, we have
   not so found Him as to content us. The desire to find Him, is not the
   desire to possess Him: it is simply a selfish anxiety to be assured,
   for our own consolation, that we do possess Him. Poor Nature, depressed
   and discouraged, is impatient of the restraints of naked faith, where
   every support is withdrawn; it is grieved to be travelling, as it were,
   in the air, where it cannot behold its own progress towards perfection.
   Its pride is irritated by a view of its defects, and this sentiment is
   mistaken for humility. It longs, from self-love, to behold itself
   perfect; it is vexed that it is not so already; it is impatient,
   haughty, and out of temper with itself and everybody else. Sad state!
   As though the work of God could be accomplished by our ill-humor! As
   though the peace of God could be attained by means of such interior
   restlessness!

   Martha, Martha! why art thou troubled and anxious about many things?
   One thing is needful, to love Him and to sit attentively at his feet!

   When we are truly abandoned to God, all things are accomplished without
   the performance of useless labor; we suffer ourselves to be guided in
   perfect trust; for the future, we will whatever God wills, and shut our
   eyes to everything else; for the present, we give ourselves up to the
   fulfillment of his designs.

   Sufficient for every day is the good and the evil thereof. This daily
   doing of the will of God is the coming of his kingdom within us, and at
   the same time our daily bread. We should be faithless indeed, and
   guilty of heathen distrust, did we desire to penetrate the future,
   which God has hidden from us; leave it to Him: let Him make it short or
   long, bitter or sweet; let Him do with it even as it shall please
   Himself.

   The most perfect preparation for this future, whatever it may be, is to
   die to every will of our own, and yield ourselves wholly up to his; we
   shall in this frame of mind, be ready to receive all the grace suitable
   to whatever state it shall be the will of God to develop in and around
   us.

   3. When we are thus prepared for every event, we begin to feel the Rock
   under our feet at the very bottom of the abyss; we are ready to suppose
   every imaginable evil of ourselves, but we throw ourselves blindly into
   the arms of God, forgetting and losing everything else. This
   forgetfulness of self is the most perfect renouncement of self and
   acceptance of God; it is the sacrifice of self-love; it would be a
   thousand times more agreeable to accuse and condemn ourselves, to
   torment body and mind, rather than to forget.

   Such an abandonment is an annihilation of self-love, in which it no
   longer finds any nourishment. Then the heart begins to expand; we begin
   to feel lighter for having thrown off the burden of self, which we
   formerly carried; we are astounded to behold the simplicity and
   straightness of the way. We thought there was a need of strife and
   constant exertion, but we now perceive that there is little to do; that
   it is sufficient to look to God with confidence, without reasoning
   either upon the past or the future, regarding Him as a loving Father,
   who leads us every moment by the hand. If some distraction or other
   should hide Him for a moment, without stopping to look at it, we simply
   turn again to Him from whom we had departed. If we commit faults, we
   repent with a repentance wholly of love, and, returning to God, he
   makes us feel whatever we ought. Sin seems hideous, but we love the
   humiliation of which it is the cause, and for which God permitted it.

   As the reflections of our pride upon our defects are bitter,
   disheartening and vexatious, so the return of the soul towards God is
   recollected, peaceful and sustained by confidence. You will find by
   experience how much more your progress will be aided by this simple,
   peaceful turning to God, than by all your chagrin and spite at the
   faults that exist in you. Only be faithful in turning quietly towards
   God alone, the moment you perceive what you have done; do not stop to
   argue with yourself; you can gain nothing from that quarter; when you
   accuse yourself of your misery, I see but you and yourself in
   consultation; poor wisdom that will issue from where God is not!

   Whose hand is it that must pluck you out of the mire? Your own? Alas!
   you are buried deeper than thought, and cannot help yourself; and more,
   this very slough is nothing but self; the whole of your trouble
   consists in the inability to leave yourself, and do you expect to
   increase your chances by dwelling constantly upon your defects, and
   feeding your sensitiveness by a view of your folly? You will in this
   way only increase your difficulties, while the gentlest look towards
   God would calm your heart. It is his presence that causes us to go
   forth from self, and when He has accomplished that, we are in peace.
   But how are we to go forth? Simply by turning gently towards God, and
   gradually forming the habit of so doing, by a faithful persistence in
   it, whenever we perceive that we have wandered from Him.

   As to that natural dejection which arises from a melancholic
   temperament, it belongs purely to the body, and is the province of the
   physician. It is true that it is constantly recurring, but let it be
   borne in peace, as we receive from his hands a fever or any other
   bodily ailment.

   The question is not, what is the state of our feelings, but what is the
   condition of our will. Let us will to have what is the condition of our
   will. Let us will to have whatever we have, and not to have whatever we
   have not. We would not even be delivered from our sufferings, for it is
   God's place to apportion to us our crosses and our joys. In the midst
   of affliction we rejoice, as did the Apostle; but it is not joy of the
   feelings, but of the will. The wicked are wretched in the midst of
   their pleasures, because they are never content with their state; they
   are always desiring to remove some thorn, or to add some flower to
   their present condition. The faithful soul, on the other hand, has a
   will which is perfectly free; it accepts, without questioning, whatever
   bitter blessings God develops, wills them, from them, and embraces
   them; it would not be freed from them, if it could be accomplished by a
   simple wish; for such a wish would be an act originating in self, and
   contrary to its abandonment to Providence, and it is desirous that this
   abandonment should be absolutely perfect.

   If there be anything capable of setting a soul in a large place, it is
   this absolute abandonment to God. It diffuses in the soul a peace which
   flows as a river, and a righteousness which is as the waves of the sea.
   (Isaiah xlviii. 18.) If there be anything that can render the soul
   calm, dissipate its scruples and dispel its fears, sweeten its
   sufferings by the anointing of love, impart strength to it in all its
   actions, and spread abroad the joy of the Holy Spirit in its
   countenance and words, it is this simple, free, and child-like repose
   in the arms of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

  XIII. ON CONFIDENCE IN GOD.

   The best rule we can ever adopt, is to receive equally, and with the
   same submission, everything that God sends us during the day, both
   within and without.

   Without, there are things disagreeable that must be met with courage,
   and things pleasant that must not be suffered to arrest our affections.
   We resist the temptations of the former by accepting them at once, and
   of the latter by refusing to admit them into our hearts. The same curse
   is necessary in regard to the interior life; whatever is bitter serves
   to crucify us, and works all its benefit in the soul, if we receive it
   simply, with a willingness that knows no bounds, and a readiness that
   seeks no alleviation.

   Pleasant gifts, which are intended to support our weakness by giving us
   a sensible consolation in our external acts, must be accepted with
   equal satisfaction, but in a different way. They must be received,
   because God sends them, and not because they are agreeable to our own
   feelings; they are to be used, like any other medicine, without
   self-complacency, without attachment to them, and without
   appropriation. We must accept them, but not hold on to them; so that
   when God sees fit to withdraw them, we may neither be dejected nor
   discouraged.

   The source presumption lies in attachment to these transitory and
   sensible gifts. We imagine we have no regard to anything but the gift
   of God, while we are really looking to self, appropriating his mercy
   and mistaking it for Him. And thus we become discouraged whenever we
   find that we have been deceived in ourselves; the soul, however, that
   is sustained upon God, is not surprised at its own misery; it is
   delighted to find new proof that it can do nothing of itself, and that
   God must do everything. I am never in the least troubled at being poor,
   when I know that my Father has infinite treasures which He will give
   me. We shall soon become independent of trust in ourselves, if we
   suffer our hearts to feed upon absolute confidence in God.

   We must count less upon sensible delights and the measures of wisdom
   which devise for our own perfection, than upon simplicity, lowliness,
   renunciation of our own efforts, and perfect pliability to all the
   designs of grace. Everything else tends to emblazon our virtues, and
   thus inspire a secret reliance upon our own resources.

   Let us pray God that he would root out of our hearts everything of our
   own planting, and set out there, with his own hands, the tree of life,
   bearing all manner of fruits.
     __________________________________________________________________

  XIV. IN WHAT MANNER WE ARE TO WATCH OURSELVES.

   The following seem to me to be useful practical directions as to the
   manner in which we ought to watch ourselves, without being too much
   occupied with the duty.

   The wise and diligent traveller watches all his steps, and keeps his
   eyes always directed to that part of the road which is immediately
   before him; but he does not incessantly look backwards to count his
   steps and examine his footmarks,--he would lose time and hinder his
   progress by so doing.

   The soul which God truly leads by the hand (for I do not now speak of
   those who are learning to walk, and who are yet looking for the road),
   ought to watch its path, but with a simple, tranquil vigilance confined
   to the present moment, and without restlessness from love of self. Its
   attention should be continually directed to the will of God, in order
   to fulfill it every instant, and not be engaged in reflex acts upon
   itself in order to be assured of its state, when God prefers it should
   be uncertain. Thus the Psalmist exclaims, Mine eyes are ever toward the
   Lord; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net. (Ps. xxv. 15.)

   Observe how, in order to keep his feet in safety in a way sown with
   snares, instead of fixing his eyes upon the ground to scrutinize every
   step, he raises them to the Lord. We never watch so diligently over
   ourselves as when we walk in the presence of God, as He commanded
   Abraham. And, in fact, what should be the end of all our vigilance? To
   follow step by step the will of God. He who conforms to that in all
   things, watches over himself and sanctifies himself in everything.

   If, then, we never lost sight of the presence of God, we should never
   cease to watch, and always with a simple, lovely, quiet and
   disinterested vigilance; while, on the other hand, the watchfulness
   which is the result of a desire to be assured of our state, is harsh,
   restless, and full of self. We must walk not by our own light, but by
   that of God. We cannot behold the holiness of God without feeling
   horror at the smallest of our transgressions.

   In addition to the presence of God and a state of recollection, we may
   add, the examination of conscience according to our need, but conducted
   in a way that grows more and more simple, easy, and destitute of
   restless self-contemplations. We examine ourselves not for our own
   satisfaction, but to conform to the advice we receive, and to
   accomplish the will of God.

   In short, we abandon ourselves into the hands of God, and are just as
   happy in knowing ourselves there, as we should be miserable if we were
   in our own. We desire to see nothing of what it pleases Him to conceal.
   As we love Him infinitely more than we do ourselves, we make an
   unconditional sacrifice of ourselves to his good pleasure; desiring
   only to love Him and to forget ourselves. He who thus generously loses
   his soul, shall find it again with eternal life.
     __________________________________________________________________

  XV. ON THE INWARD TEACHING OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD.

   It is certain from the Holy Scriptures (Rom. viii.; John xiv.,) that
   the Spirit of God dwells within us, acts there, prays without ceasing,
   groans, desires, asks for us what we know not how to ask for ourselves,
   urges us on, animates us, speaks to us when we are silent, suggests to
   us all truth, and so unites us to Him that we become one spirit. (1
   Cor. vi. 17.) This is the teaching of faith, and even those instructors
   who are farthest removed from the interior life, cannot avoid
   acknowledging so much. Still, notwithstanding these theoretical
   principles, they always strive to maintain that in practice the
   external law, or at least a certain light of learning and reason,
   illuminates us within, and that then our understanding acts of itself
   from that instruction. They do not rely sufficiently upon the interior
   teacher, the Holy Spirit, who does everything in us. He is the soul of
   our soul; we could not form a thought or a desire without Him. Alas!
   what blindness is ours! We reckon ourselves alone in the interior
   sanctuary, when God is much more intimately present there than we are
   ourselves.

   What, then! you will say, are we all inspired? Yes, doubtless; but not
   as were the prophets and apostles. Without the actual inspiration of
   the Spirit of grace, we could neither do, nor will, nor believe any
   good thing. We are, then, always inspired, but we incessantly stifle
   the inspiration. God does not cease to speak, but the noise of the
   creatures without, and of our passions within, confines us and prevents
   our hearing. We must silence every creature, including self, that in
   the deep stillness of the soul we may perceive the ineffable voice of
   the Bridegroom. We must lend an attentive ear, for his voice is soft
   and still, and is only heard of those who hear nothing else!

   Ah, how rare is it to find a soul still enough to hear God speak! The
   slightest murmur of our vain desires, or of a love fixed upon self,
   confounds all the words of the Spirit of God. We hear well enough that
   he is speaking, and that he is asking for something, but we cannot
   distinguish what is said, and are often glad enough that we cannot. The
   least reserve, the slightest self-reflective act, the most
   imperceptible fear of hearing too clearly what God demands, interferes
   with the interior voice. Need we be astonished, then, if so many
   people, pious indeed, but full of amusements, vain desires, false
   wisdom, and confidence in their own virtues, cannot hear it, and
   consider its existence as a dream of fanatics? Alas! what would they
   with their proud reasonings? Of what efficacy would be the exterior
   word of pastors, or even of the Scriptures themselves, if we had not
   within, the word of the Holy Spirit giving to the others all their
   vitality? The outward word, even of the Gospel, without the
   fecundating, vivifying, interior word would be but an empty sound. It
   is the letter that alone killeth (2 Cor. iii. 6), and the Spirit alone
   can give us life.

   O! eternal and omnipotent word of the Father, it is thou that speakest
   in the depth of our souls! The word that proceeded from the mouth of
   the Saviour, during the days of his mortal life, has only had energy to
   produce such wonderous fruits, because it has been animated by that
   Spirit of life which is The Word itself. Hence it is that St. Peter
   says: Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life.
   (John vi. 68.)

   It is not, then, the outward law of the Gospel alone which God shows us
   internally, by the light of reason and faith; it is his Spirit that
   speaks, touches, operates in and animates us; so that it is the Spirit
   which does in us and with us whatever we do that is good, as it is our
   soul that gives life to our body, and regulates all its movements.

   It is, then, true, that we are continually inspired, and that we do not
   lead a gracious life, except so far as we act under this interior
   inspiration. But O God! how few Christians feel it! how few are they,
   who do not annihilate it by their voluntary distractions, or by their
   resistance!

   Let us recognize, then, the fact that God is incessantly speaking in
   us. [2] He speaks in the impenitent also, but, stunned by the noise of
   the world and their passions, they cannot hear Him; the interior voice
   is to them a fable. He speaks in awakened sinners; they are sensible of
   remorse of conscience, which is the voice of God reproaching them
   inwardly for their sins. When they are deeply moved, they have no
   difficulty in understanding about this interior voice, for it is it
   that pierces them so sharply. It is in them that two-edged sword of
   which Paul speaks as piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and
   spirit. (Heb. iv. 12.) God causes himself to be perceived, enjoyed,
   followed; they hear that sweet voice that buries a reproach in the
   bottom of the heart, and causes it to be torn in pieces. Such is true
   and pure contrition.

   God speaks, too, in wise and enlightened persons, whose life, outwardly
   correct, seems adorned with many virtues; but such are often too full
   of themselves and their lights, to listen to God. Everything is turned
   into reasoning; they substitute the principles of natural wisdom and
   the plans of human prudence, for what would come infinitely better
   through the channel of simplicity and docility to the word of God. They
   seem good, sometimes better than others; they are so, perhaps, up to a
   certain point, but it is a mixed goodness. They are still in possession
   of themselves, and desire always to be so, according to the measure of
   their reason; they love to be in the hands of their own counsel, and to
   be strong and great in their own eyes.

   I thank thee, O my God with Jesus Christ, that Thou hast hid thine
   ineffable secrets from these great and wise ones, whilst Thou takest
   pleasure in revealing them to feeble and humble souls! It is with babes
   alone that Thou art wholly unreserved; the others Thou treatest in
   their own way; they desire knowledge and great virtues, and Thou givest
   them dazzling illuminations, and convertest them into heroes. But this
   is not the better part; there is something more hidden for thy dearest
   children; they lie with John on thy breast. As for these great ones who
   are constantly afraid of stooping and becoming lowly, Thou leavest them
   in all their greatness; they shall never share thy caresses and thy
   familiarity, for to deserve these, they must become as little children,
   and play upon thy knees.

   I have often observed that a rude, ignorant sinner, just beginning to
   be touched by a lively sense of the love of God, is much more disposed
   to listen to this inward language of the Spirit of Grace, than those
   enlightened and learned persons who have grown old in their own wisdom.
   God, whose sole desire is to communicate Himself, cannot, so to speak,
   find where to set his foot in souls so full of themselves, who have
   grown fat upon their own wisdom and virtues; but, as says the
   Scripture, "his secret is with the simple." (Prov. iii. 32. vulg.)

   But where are they? I do not find them; God sees them and loves to
   dwell in them; "My Father and I," says Jesus Christ, "will come unto
   him and make our abode with him." (John xiv. 23.) Ah! a soul delivered
   from self, and abandoned to grace, counting itself as nothing, and
   walking, without thought, at the will of that pure love which is its
   perfect guide, has an experience which the wise can neither receive nor
   understand!

   I was once as wise as any; thinking I saw everything, I saw nothing; I
   crept along feeling my way by a succession of reasonings, but there was
   no ray to enlighten my darkness; I was content to reason. But when we
   have silenced everything within, that we may listen to God, we know all
   things without knowing anything, and then perceive that, until then, we
   were utterly ignorant of all that we thought we understood. We lose all
   that we once had, and care not for it; we have then no more that
   belongs to self; all things are lost, and we with them. There is
   something within that joins with the spouse in the Canticles in saying;
   "Let me see thy countenance, let he hear thy voice; for sweet is thy
   voice and thy countenance is comely." (Sol. Song. ii. 14.) Ah! how
   sweet is that voice, it makes me all tremulous within! Speak, O
   beloved, and let none other dare to speak but Thee! Be still, my soul;
   speak, Love!

   Then it is that we know all things without knowing anything. Not that
   we have the presumption to suppose that we possess in ourselves all
   truth. No! on the contrary, we feel that we see nothing, can do
   nothing, and are nothing: we feel it and are delighted at it. But in
   this unreserved abandonment, we find everything we need from moment to
   moment, in the infinity of God. There we find the daily bread of
   knowledge, as of everything else, without lying up; then the unction
   from above teaches us all truth, while it takes away our own wisdom,
   glory, interest, yea, our own will; it makes us content with our
   powerlessness, and with a position below every creature; we are ready
   to yield to the merest worms of the dust, and to confess our most
   secret miseries before the whole world, fearing unfaithfulness more
   than punishment and confusion of face.

   Here it is, I say, that the Spirit teaches us all truth; for all truth
   is eminently contained in this sacrifice of love, where the soul strips
   itself of everything to present it to God.

  XVI. ON DAILY FAULTS AND THE TOLERATION OF OURSELVES.

   You understand that many of our faults are voluntary in different
   degrees, though they may not be committed with a deliberate purpose of
   failing in our allegiance to God. One friend sometimes reproaches
   another for a fault not expressly intended to be offensive, and yet
   committed with the knowledge that it would be so. In the same way, God
   lays this sort of faults to our charge. They are voluntary, for
   although not done with an express intention, they are still committed
   freely and against a certain interior light of conscience, which should
   have caused us to hesitate and wait.

   Of these offences, pious souls are often guilty; as to those of
   deliberate purpose, it would be strange indeed if a soul consecrated to
   God should fall into such.

   Little faults become great, and even monstrous in our eyes, in
   proportion as the pure light of God increases in us; just as the sun in
   rising, reveals the true dimensions of objects which were dimly and
   confusedly discovered during the night. Be sure that, with the increase
   of the inward light, the imperfections which you have hitherto seen,
   will be beheld as far greater and more deadly in their foundations,
   than you now conceive them, and that you will witness, in addition, the
   development of a crowd of others, of the existence of which you have
   not now the slightest suspicion. You will there find the weaknesses
   necessary to deprive you of all confidence in your own strength; but
   this discovery, far from discouraging, will serve to destroy your
   self-reliance, and to raze to the ground the edifice of pride. Nothing
   marks so decidedly the solid progress of a soul, as that it is enabled
   to view its own depravity without being disturbed or discouraged.

   It is an important precept to abstain from doing a wrong thing whenever
   we perceive it in time, and when we do not, to bear the humiliation of
   the fault courageously.

   If a fault is perceived before it is committed, we must see to it that
   we do not resist and quench the Spirit of God, advising us of it
   inwardly. The Spirit is easily offended, and very jealous; He desires
   to be listened to and obeyed; He retires if He be displeased; the
   slightest resistance to Him is a wrong, for everything must yield to
   Him, the moment He is perceived. Faults of haste and frailty are
   nothing in comparison with those where we shut our ears to the voice of
   the Holy Spirit beginning to speak in the depths of the heart.

   Restlessness and an injured self-love will never mend those faults
   which are not perceived until after they are committed; on the
   contrary, such feelings are simply the impatience of wounded pride at
   beholding what confounds it. We must quietly humble ourselves in peace;
   I say in peace, for it is no humiliation to do it in a vexed and
   spiteful way. We must condemn our faults, mourn over them, repent of
   them, without seeking the slightest shadow of consolation in any
   excuse, and behold ourselves covered with confusion in the presence of
   God; and all this without being bitter against ourselves or
   discouraged; but peacefully reaping the profit of our humiliation. Thus
   from the serpent itself we draw the antidote to his venom.

   It often happens that what we offer to God, is not what he most desires
   to have of us; that we are frequently the most unwilling to give, and
   the most fearful He will ask. He desires the sacrifice of the Isaac,
   the well-beloved son; all the rest is as nothing in his eyes, and he
   permits it to be offered in a painful unprofitable manner, because He
   has no blessings for a divided soul. He will have everything, and until
   then there is no rest. Who hath hardened himself against Him and hath
   prospered? (Job ix. 4.) Would you prosper, and secure the blessing of
   God upon your labors? Reserve nothing, cut to the quick and burn, spare
   nothing, and the God of peace will be with you. What consolation, what
   liberty, what strength, what enlargedness of heart, what increase of
   grace, will follow when there remains nothing between God and the soul,
   and when the last sacrifices have been offered up without hesitation!

   We must neither be astonished nor disheartened. We are not more wicked
   than we were; we are really less so; but while our evil diminishes, our
   light increases, and we are struck with horror at its extent. But let
   us remember, for our consolation, that the perception of our disease is
   the first step to a cure; when we have no sense of our need, we have no
   curative principle within; it is a state of blindness, presumption and
   insensibility, in which we are delivered over to our own counsel, and
   commit ourselves to the current, the fatal rapidity of which we do not
   realize, until we are called to struggle against it.

   We must not be discouraged either by experience of our weakness, or by
   dislike of the constant activity which may be inseparable from our
   condition in life. Discouragement is not a fruit of humility, but of
   pride; nothing can be worse. Suppose we have stumbled, or even fallen,
   let us rise and run again; all our falls are useful, if they strip us
   of a disastrous confidence in ourselves, while they do not take away a
   humble and salutary trust in God.

   The repugnances which we feel towards our duties, come, no doubt, of
   imperfections; if we were perfect, we should love everything in the
   order of God, but since we are born corrupt, and with a nature
   revolting against his laws, let us praise Him that He knows how to
   evolve good from evil, and can make use even of our repugnances as a
   source of virtue. The work of grace does not always advance as
   regularly as that of nature, says St. Theresa.

   Carefully purify your conscience, then, from daily faults; suffer no
   sin to dwell in your heart; small as it may seem, it obscures the light
   of grace, weighs down the soul, and hinders that constant communion
   with Jesus Christ which it should be your pleasure to cultivate; you
   will become lukewarm, forget God, and find yourself growing in
   attachment to the creature. A pure soul, on the other hand, which is
   humiliated, and rises promptly after its smallest faults, is always
   fervent and always upright.

   God never makes us sensible of our weakness except to give us of His
   strength; we must not be disturbed by what is involuntary. The great
   point is, never to act in opposition to the inward light, and to be
   willing to go as far as God would have us.
     __________________________________________________________________

  XVII. ON FIDELITY IN SMALL MATTERS.

   St. Francis of Sales says that great virtues and fidelity in small
   things are like sugar and salt; sugar is more delicious, but of less
   frequent use, while salt enters into every article of our food. Great
   virtues are rare; they are seldom needed, and when the occasion comes,
   we are prepared for it by everything which has preceded, excited by the
   greatness of the sacrifice, and sustained either by the brilliancy of
   the action in the eyes of others, or by self-complacency in our ability
   to do such wonderful things. Small occasions, however, are unforeseen;
   they recur every moment, and place us incessantly in conflict with our
   pride, our sloth, our self-esteem, and our passions; they are
   calculated thoroughly to subdue our wills, and leave us no retreat. If
   we are faithful in them, nature will have no time to breathe, and must
   die to all her inclinations. It would please us much better to make
   some great sacrifices, however painful and violent, on condition of
   obtaining liberty to follow our own pleasure, and retain our old habits
   in little things. But it is only by this fidelity in small matters that
   the grace of true love is sustained and distinguished from the
   transitory excitements of nature.

   It is with piety as it is with our temporal goods; there is more danger
   from little expenses than from larger disbursements, and he who
   understands how to take care of what is insignificant, will soon
   accumulate a large fortune. Everything great owes its greatness to the
   small elements of which it is composed; he that loses nothing, will
   soon be rich.

   Consider, on the other hand, that God does not so much regard our
   actions, as the motive of love from which they spring, and the
   pliability of our wills to his. Men judge our deeds by their outward
   appearance; with God, that which is most dazzling in the eyes of man,
   is of no account. What he desires is a pure intention, a will ready for
   anything, and ever pliable in his hands, and an honest abandonment of
   self; and all this can be much more frequently manifested on small than
   on extraordinary occasions; there will also be much less danger from
   pride, and the trial will be far more searching. Indeed, it sometimes
   happens, that we find it harder to part with a trifle than with an
   important interest; it may be more of a cross to abandon a vain
   amusement, than to bestow a large sum in charity.

   We are the more easily deceived about these small matters, in
   proportion as we imagine them to be innocent, and ourselves indifferent
   to them. Nevertheless, when God takes them away, we may easily
   recognize, in the pain of the deprivation, how excessive and
   inexcusable were both the use and the attachment. If we are in the
   habit of neglecting little things, we shall be constantly offending our
   families, our domestics, and the public. No one can well believe that
   our piety is sincere, when our behavior is loose and irregular in its
   little details. What ground have we for believing that we are ready to
   make the greatest sacrifices, when we daily fail in offering the least?

   But the greatest danger of all consists in this, that by neglecting
   small matters, the soul becomes accustomed to unfaithfulness. We grieve
   the Holy Spirit, we return to ourselves, we think it a little thing to
   be wanting towards God. On the other hand, true love can see nothing
   small; everything that can either please or displease God, seems to be
   great; not that true love disturbs the soul with scruples, but it puts
   no limits to its faithfulness. It acts simply with God; and as it does
   not concern itself about those things which God does not require from
   it, so it never hesitates an instant about those which He does, be they
   great or small.

   Thus it is not by incessant care that we become faithful and exact in
   the smallest things, but simply by a love which is free from the
   reflections and fears of restless and scrupulous souls. We are, as it
   were, drawn along by the love of God; we have no desire to do anything
   but what we do, and no will in respect to anything which we do not do.
   At the very moment when God is following the soul, relentlessly
   pursuing it into the smallest details, and seemingly depriving it of
   all its liberty, it finds itself in a large place, and enjoys a perfect
   peace in Him. Happy soul!

   Those persons who are by nature less strict in small matters, should
   lay down and preserve inviolate the most rigid laws in respect to them.
   They are tempted to despise them; they habitually think little of them,
   and do not sufficiently estimate their importance; they do not consider
   the insensible progress of our passions, and even forget their own sad
   experience on the subject. They prefer rather to be deluded by the
   promise of an imaginary firmness, and to trust to their own courage
   that has so often deceived them, than to subject themselves to a
   never-ceasing fidelity. It is a small matter, say they; true, but it is
   of amazing consequence to you; it is a matter that you love well enough
   to refuse to give it up to God; a matter which you sneer at in words,
   that you may have a pretence to retain it; a small matter, but one that
   you withhold from your Maker, and which will prove your ruin.

   It is no nobility of soul that despises small things; on the contrary,
   it is a contracted spirit that regards as unimportant, what it cannot
   trace to its necessary and overwhelming results. The more trouble it
   occasions us to be on our guard against small matters, the more need
   have we to fear negligence, to distrust our strength, and to interpose
   impregnable barriers between ourselves and the least remissness.

   Finally, judge by your own feelings. What would you think of a friend
   who owed everything to you, and who was willing from a sense of duty to
   serve you on those rare occasions which are called great, but who
   should manifest neither affection nor the least regard for your wishes
   in the common intercourse of life?

   Do not be frightened at this minute attention to small matters. It
   needs courage at first; but this is a penance which you deserve, which
   you need, and which will work out for you peace and security; without
   it, all is trouble and relapse. God will gradually make it pleasant and
   easy to you, for true love is obedient without constraint, and without
   strife or effort.
     __________________________________________________________________

  XVIII. ON TRANSITORY EMOTIONS, FIDELITY, AND SIMPLICITY.

   We must not be surprised if we frequently perceive in ourselves
   emotions of pride, of self-complacency, of confidence in ourselves, of
   desire to follow our own inclination contrary to right, of impatience
   at the weakness of others, or at the annoyances of our own state. In
   such cases we must instantly let them drop like a stone to the bottom
   of the sea, recollect ourselves in God, and wait, before acting, until
   we are in such a frame as our recollection should induce in us. If the
   distraction of business, or of vivacity of imagination, should hinder
   us from calmly and easily entering into such a state, we must at least
   endeavor to be quiet by the rectitude of the will, and by the desire
   for recollection. In such a case, the will to be recollected, answers
   to deprive the soul of its own will, and to render it docile in the
   hands of God.

   If perchance in your excitement, some emotion too nearly allied to
   depraved nature, should have escaped you, be not discouraged; go
   straight on; quietly bear the humiliation of your fault before God,
   without being delayed by the smarting of self-love at the betrayal of
   its weakness. Proceed confidently, without being troubled by the
   anguish of a wounded pride that cannot bear to see itself imperfect.
   Your fault will be of service in causing you to die to self, and to
   become nothing before Him.

   The true method of curing this defect is to become dead to the
   sensitiveness of self-love, without hindering the course of grace,
   which had been a little interrupted by this transitory unfaithfulness.

   The great point is to renounce your own wisdom by simplicity of walk,
   and to be ready to give up the favor, esteem, and approbation of every
   one, whenever the path in which God leads you passes that way. We are
   not to meddle with things which God does not lay upon us, nor uselessly
   utter hard sayings which those about us are not able to bear.

   We must follow after God, never precede Him; when He gives the signal,
   we must leave all and follow Him. If, after an absolute consecration to
   Him, and a conviction in conscience that he requires something of us,
   we hesitate, delay, lose courage, dilute what He would have us do,
   indulge fears for our own comfort or safety, desire to shield ourselves
   from suffering and obloquy, or seek to find some excuse for not
   performing a difficult and painful duty, we are truly guilty in his
   sight. God keep you from such unfaithfulness! Nothing is more dreadful
   than this inward resistance to Him; it is that sin against the Holy
   Ghost of which our Lord assures us that it shall not be forgiven,
   neither in this world, neither in the world to come. (Matt. xii. 32.)

   Other faults committed in the simplicity of your good intentions, will
   be of service if they produce humility, and render you of less account
   in your own eyes. But resistance to the Spirit of God through pride and
   a pusillanimous worldly wisdom, tender of its own comfort in performing
   the work of God, is a fault which will insensibly quench the Spirit of
   Grace in your heart. God, jealous and rejected after so much mercy,
   will depart and leave you to your own resources; you will then turn
   round in a kind of circle instead of advancing with rapid strides along
   the King's highway; your inward life will grow dim and dimmer, without
   your being able to detect the sure and deep-seated source of your
   disease.

   God would behold in you a simplicity which will contain so much the
   more of his wisdom as it contains less of your own; He desires to see
   you lowly in your own eyes, and as docile in his hands as a babe. He
   desires to create in your heart that child-like disposition so
   distasteful to the spirit of man, but so agreeable to the spirit of the
   Gospel, in spite of the infection of a scornful and contemptuous world.

   By this very simplicity and lowliness He will heal all the remains of
   haughty and self-confident wisdom in you, and you shall say with David,
   And I will yet be more vile than this, and will be base in mine own
   sight, (1 Sam. vi. 22,) from the moment that you give yourself to the
   Lord.
     __________________________________________________________________

  XIX. ON THE ADVANTAGES OF SILENCE AND RECOLLECTION.

   You must endeavor to be as silent as the proprieties of human
   intercourse will permit. This grace cherishes the presence of God,
   saves us many proud and rude expressions, and suppresses a great
   multitude of idle words and dangerous judgments of our neighbor.
   Silence humbles our spirit, and gradually detaches it from the world;
   it constitutes in the heart a sort of solitude like that you so much
   long after, and will supply all your wants in the many perplexities
   that surround you. If we never unnecessarily open our mouths, we may
   enjoy many moments of communion even when unavoidably detained in
   society.

   You desire to be at liberty, that you may pray to God; and God, who
   knows so much better than we do, what we really want, sends perplexity
   and restraint, that you may become mortified. This trial from the hand
   of God, will be far more serviceable to you, than the self-sought
   sweetness of prayer. You know very well that constant retirement is not
   necessary, in order to love God. When He gives you the time, take it
   and profit by it, but until then, wait in faith, well persuaded that
   what He orders is best.

   Frequently raise your heart to Him in abstraction from the world; speak
   only when obliged to; bear with patience whatever happens to cross you.
   You are already acquainted with religion, and God treats you according
   to your necessity; you have more need of mortification than of
   illumination. The only thing I fear for you in this state, is
   wanderings, and you may avoid those by silence. Only be faithful in
   keeping silence, when it is not necessary to speak, and God will send
   grace to preserve you from dissipation when it is.

   When you are not permitted to enjoy long seasons of leisure, economize
   the short ones; ten minutes thus faithfully employed before God, in the
   midst of your distractions, will be as valuable to you as whole hours
   devoted to Him, in your more unoccupied moments. Farther, these little
   odds and ends of time, will amount to quite a sum in the course of the
   day, and present this advantage, that God will very likely have been
   more in mind than if you had given it to Him all at once. Love,
   silence, suffering, yielding our own pleasure to the will of God, and
   to the love of our neighbor, such is our portion; too happy in bearing
   the burden which God himself lays upon us in the order of his
   Providence!

   The crosses which originate with ourselves, are not near as efficient
   in eradicating self-love, as those which come in the daily allotments
   of God. These latter contribute no ailment for the nourishment of our
   own wills, and as they proceed immediately from a merciful Providence,
   they are accompanied by grace sufficient for all our needs. We have
   nothing to do, then, but to surrender ourselves to God each day,
   without looking farther; He will carry is in his arms as a tender
   mother bears her child. Let us believe, hope, and love with all the
   simplicity of babes; in every necessity turning a loving and trusting
   look towards our Heavenly Father. For what says the Scripture, "Can a
   woman forget her sucking child that she should not have compassion on
   the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee!"
   (Isaiah xlix. 15.)
     __________________________________________________________________

  XX. PRIVATION AND ANNIHILATION, A TERROR EVEN TO THE SPIRITUALLY-MINDED.

   There is scarce any one who desires to serve God, but does so for
   selfish reasons; we expect gain and not loss, consolation and not
   suffering, riches and not poverty, increase and not diminution. But the
   whole interior work is of an opposite character; to be lost,
   sacrificed, made less than nothing, and despoiled of an excessive
   delight, even in the gifts of God, that we may be forced to cling to
   Him alone.

   We are like a patient eagerly desiring returning health, who feels his
   own pulse forty times a day, and requires his physician to prescribe
   frequent doses of various remedies, and to give him a daily assurance
   that he is getting better. Such is almost the only use we make of our
   spiritual conductors. We travel in a little round of every-day virtues,
   never gathering sufficient courage to pass generously beyond it, and
   our guides, like the doctor, flatter, console, encourage and strengthen
   our selfish sensitiveness, and administer pleasant remedies, to the
   effects of which we soon become insensible.

   The moment we find ourselves deprived of the delights of grace, that
   milk for babes, we are at once in despair; a manifest proof that we
   were looking to the means, instead of to the end, and solely for
   selfish gratification.

   Privations are meat for men; by them the soul is rendered hardy, is
   separated from self, and offered in a pure sacrifice to God; but we
   give up all, the moment they commence. We cannot but think that
   everything is going to ruin, when, in fact, the foundations are just
   beginning to be solidly laid. Nothing would give us more delight than
   that God should do all his pleasure with us, provided it should always
   be to magnify and perfect us in our own eyes. But if we are not willing
   to be destroyed and annihilated, we shall never become that whole burnt
   offering, which is entirely consumed in the blaze of God's love.

   We desire to enter into a state of pure faith, and retain our own
   wisdom! To be a babe, and great in our own eyes! Ah! what a sad
   delusion!
     __________________________________________________________________

  XXI. ON THE PROPER USE OF CROSSES.

   We are hardly to be persuaded of the goodness of God in loading those
   whom He loves with crosses. Why, we say, should He take pleasure in
   causing us to suffer? Could he not render us good without making us
   miserable? Yes, doubtless, He could, for all things are possible with
   God. He holds in his omnipotent hands the hearts of men, and turns them
   as He will; as the skill of the workman can give direction to the
   stream on the summit of a hill. But able as He was to save us without
   crosses, He has not chosen to do it; as he has not seen fit to create
   men at once in the full vigor of manhood, but has suffered them to grow
   up by degrees amid all the perils and weaknesses of infancy and youth.
   In this matter, He is the Master; we have only to adore in silence the
   depths of His wisdom, without comprehending it. Nevertheless, we see
   clearly that we never could become wholly good without becoming humble,
   unselfish, and disposed to refer everything to God, without any
   restless self-reflective acts.

   The work of grace, in detaching us from self and destroying our
   self-love, could not be otherwise than painful, without a miracle.
   Neither in his gracious nor providential dealings does God work a
   miracle lightly. It would be as great a wonder to see a person full of
   self become in a moment dead to all self-interest and all
   sensitiveness, as it would be to see a slumbering infant wake in the
   morning a fully-developed man. God works in a mysterious was in grace
   as well as in nature, concealing his operations under an imperceptible
   succession of events, and thus keeps us always in the darkness of
   faith. He not only accomplishes his designs gradually, but by means
   that seem the most simple, and the most competent to the end, in order
   that human wisdom may attribute the success to the means, and thus his
   own working be less manifest; otherwise every act of God would seem to
   be a miracle, and the state of faith, wherein it is the will of God
   that we should live, would come to an end.

   This state of faith is necessary, not only to stimulate the good,
   causing them to sacrifice their reason in a life so full of darkness,
   but also to blind those who, by their presumption, deserve such a
   sentence. They behold the works of God, but do not understand them;
   they can see nothing in them but the effects of material laws; they are
   destitute of true knowledge, for that is only open to those who
   distrust their own abilities; proud human wisdom is unworthy to be
   taken into the counsels of God.

   God renders the working of grace slow and obscure, then, that he may
   keep us in the darkness of faith. He makes use of the inconstancy and
   ingratitude of the creature, and of the disappointments and surfeits
   which accompany prosperity, to detach us from them both; He frees us
   from self by revealing to us our weaknesses, and our corruptions, in a
   multitude of backslidings. All this dealing appears perfectly natural,
   and it is by this succession of natural means that we are burnt as by a
   slow fire. We should like to be consumed at once by the flames of pure
   love, but such an end would scarce cost us anything; it is only an
   excessive self-love that desires thus to become perfect in a moment and
   at so cheap a rate.

   Why do we rebel against the length of the way? Because we are wrapt up
   in self; and God must destroy an infatuation which is a constant
   hinderance to his work. Of what, then, can we complain? Our trouble is,
   that we are attached to creatures, and still more to self; God prepares
   a series of events which gradually detaches us from creatures, and
   separates us from self. The operation is painful, but is rendered
   necessary by our corruption, and the same cause makes it distressing;
   if our flesh were sound, the surgeon would use no knife; he only cuts
   in proportion to the depth of the wound, and the diseased condition of
   the parts; if we suffer greatly, it is because the evil is great; is
   the surgeon cruel because he cuts to the quick? Nay, on the contrary,
   it is both love and skill; he would treat in the same way his only and
   well-beloved son.

   It is the same with God. He never afflicts us, if we may so say, except
   against his own inclination; his paternal heart is not gratified by the
   sight of our misery, but he cuts to the quick, that He may heal the
   disease in our souls. He must snatch away from us whatever we cling to
   too fondly, and all that we love irregularly and to the prejudice of
   his rights. He acts in this as we do by children; they cry because we
   take away the knife, which was their amusement, but might have been
   their death. We weep, we become discouraged, we cry aloud; we are ready
   to murmur against God, as children get angry with their mothers. But
   God lets us weep, and secures our salvation; He afflicts only to amend;
   even when He seems to overwhelm, He means nothing but good; it is only
   to spare us the evils we were preparing for ourselves. The things we
   now lament for a little space, would have caused us to mourn forever;
   what we think lost, was indeed lost when we seemed to have it, but now
   God has laid it aside for us, that we may inherit it in the eternity so
   near at hand. He only deprives us of what we cherish, to teach us how
   to love it purely, solidly, and moderately, and to secure to us its
   eternal enjoyment in his own bosom; to do us a thousand times more good
   than we could ask or think of ourselves.

   With the exception of sin, nothing happens, in this world, out of the
   will of God. It is He who is the author, ruler, and bestower of all; He
   has numbered the hairs of our head, the leaves of every tree, the sand
   upon the sea-shore, and the drops of the ocean. When He made the
   universe, his wisdom weighed and measured every atom. It is he that
   breathes into us the breath of life, and renews it every moment; He it
   is that knows the number of our days, and that holds in his
   all-powerful hand, the keys of the tomb to open or to shut.

   What we admire, is as nothing in the eyes of God: a little more or less
   of life, is a difference that disappears in the light of eternity. What
   matter whether this fragile vessel, this clay tabernacle, be broken and
   reduced to ashes, a little sooner or later?

   Ah! what short-sighted and deceitful views are ours! We are thrown into
   consternation at the death of a man in the prime of life. What a
   dreadful loss! exclaims the world. Who has lost anything? The dead? He
   has lost some years of vanity, illusion, and danger to his immortal
   soul; God has snatched him from the midst of his iniquities, and
   separated him from a corrupt world and his own weakness. The friends
   whom he has left? They are deprived of the poison of worldly felicity;
   they lose a perpetual intoxication; they get rid of the forgetfulness
   of God and themselves, in which they lay sunk--say, rather, they gain
   the bliss of detachment from the world, through the virtue of the
   cross. The same blow that saves the dying, prepares the survivors, by
   their suffering, to labor courageously for their own salvation. O! is
   it not true that God is good, tender, compassionate towards our misery,
   even when He seems to launch his thunders at us, and we are
   open-mouthed in our complaints of his severity!

   What difference can we discover between two persons who lived a century
   ago? The one died twenty years before the other, but now they are both
   gone; the separation which then seemed so abrupt and so long, appears
   as nothing to us, and was, in fact, but short. Those things which are
   severed, shall soon be reunited, and no trace of the separation will be
   visible. We look upon ourselves as immortal, or at least as having a
   duration of ages. O folly and madness! those who die from day to day,
   tread upon the heels of those that are already dead; life flows like a
   torrent; that which is gone is but a dream, and even while we
   contemplate that which now is, it vanishes and is lost in the abyss of
   the past. So will it be with the future; days, months, and years, glide
   like the billows of a torrent, each hurrying along the other. A few
   moments more, and all is over! Alas! how short will that existence then
   appear, which now wearies us with its sad and tedious length!

   The disgust of life is the result of the weakness of our self-love. The
   sick man thinks the night will never end, because he sleeps not, but it
   is no longer than others; we exaggerate all our sufferings by our
   cowardice; they are great, it is true, but they are magnified by
   timidity. The way to lessen them is to abandon ourselves courageously
   into the hands of God; we must suffer, but the end of our pain is to
   purify our souls, and make us worthy of Him.

  XXII. ON THE INTERIOR OPERATIONS OF GOD TO BRING MAN TO THE TRUE END OF HIS
  CREATION.

   In the beginning God attacked us in externals; little by little he
   withdrew such of his creatures as we loved too much, and contrary to
   his law. But this outward work, though essential in laying the
   foundation of the building, goes but a little way towards the
   completion of the whole edifice. The interior operation, although
   invisible, is beyond comparison, greater, more difficult, and more
   wonderful!

   There comes a time, when God, having completely stripped us, having
   mortified the flesh as to the creatures to which it clung, commences an
   interior work for the purpose of forcing from us our hold upon Self.
   External objects are now no longer the subjects of his spoliations: he
   would tear from us the I, which is the centre of our self-love. It was
   only for the sake of this I that we loved all the rest; and He now
   pursues it relentlessly and without cessation. To deprive a man of his
   clothing, would be harsh treatment enough; but that is nothing in
   comparison with the discipline which should strip off his skin and
   muscles, and reduce him to a skeleton of bones. Trim up the branches of
   a tree, and far from killing it, you even add to its vigor, and it
   shoots out again on every side; but attack the trunk, wither the root,
   and it fades, languishes and dies. It is the good will of God towards
   us, thus to make us die to self.

   As to the external mortification of the senses, He causes us to
   accomplish it be certain courageous efforts against ourselves. The more
   the senses are destroyed by the courage of the soul, the more highly
   does the soul estimate its own virtue, and live by its own labor. But
   in process of time, God reserves for his own hand the work of attacking
   the soul in its depths, and depriving it finally of the last vestige of
   the life of Self. It is no longer the strength of the soul that is then
   employed against the things without, but its weakness that is turned
   against itself. It looks at self; it is shocked at what it sees: it
   remains faithful, but it no longer beholds its own fidelity. Every
   defect in its previous history rises up to view, and often new faults,
   of which it had never before even suspected the existence. It no longer
   finds those supports of fervor and courage which formerly nourished it.
   It faints; like Jesus, it is heavy even unto death. All is taken away
   but the will to retain nothing, and to let God work without
   reservation.

   It has not even the consolation of perceiving that it has such a will.
   It is no longer a perceptible, designed will, but simple, without
   reflex acts, and so much the more hidden, as it is deeper and more
   intimate in the soul. In such a state, God sees to everything that is
   necessary to detach the soul from self. He strips it little by little,
   removing one after another all the investments in which is was wrapped.

   The last operations, though not always the greatest, are, nevertheless,
   the most severe. Though the outside garments may be more costly than
   those within, yet the removal of the latter is more painful than that
   of the former. During the first, we are consoled by reflecting upon
   what is left us; during the last, nought remains but bitterness,
   nakedness, and confusion.

   I shall perhaps be asked, in what these deprivations consist; but I
   cannot say. They are as various as the characters of men. Each man
   suffers according to his necessity, and the designs of God. How is it
   possible to know what will be taken off from us, when we do not know
   what we have on? We cling to an infinity of things which we should
   never suspect; we only feel that they are a part of us when they are
   snatched away, as I am only conscious that I have hairs when they are
   pulled from my head. God develops to us, little by little, what is
   within us, of which we are, until then, entirely ignorant, and we are
   astonished at discovering in our very virtues, defects of which we
   should never have believed ourselves capable. It is like a grotto which
   appears perfectly dry, but in which the water suddenly sprout out from
   every point, even from those that were least suspended.

   These spoliations are not commonly such as could have been anticipated.
   That which we expect, finds us prepared, and is scarce proper to hasten
   the death of self. God surprises us in the most unlooked-for quarters.
   They are nothings, but nothings which desolate us and crucify
   self-love. Great and striking virtues are no longer appropriate; they
   would nourish pride, and communicate a certain degree of strength and
   interior assurance contrary to the design of God, which is, to make us
   lose ground. Then it is a simple, single way; everything is
   commonplace. Others see nothing great, and the person himself discovers
   within, only what seems natural, weak, and feeble; but he would rather
   a hundred times, fast all his life on bread and water, and practice the
   greatest austerities, than suffer what is going on within him. Not
   because he enjoys a certain taste of fervor in austerities; not at all,
   that delight is gone; but he finds in the pliability which God requires
   in an infinity of little things, more of self-abandonment and death
   than there would be in great sacrifices.

   Nevertheless, God never leaves the soul until He has rendered it supple
   and pliable, by twisting it all manner of ways. At one time the person
   must speak frankly; at another be still; he must be praised, then
   blamed, then forgotten, and then examined anew; he must be low, he must
   be high, he must suffer condemnation without uttering a word in
   self-defence, and again he must speak well of himself. He must be
   willing to find himself weak, restless, and irresolute in the merest
   trifles; manifesting the waywardness of a little child; shocking his
   friends by his coldness; becoming jealous and suspicious without
   reason; even relating his most foolish jealousies to those in regard to
   whom he feel them; speaking with patience and labor to persons,
   contrary to their desire and his own, and without fruit; appearing
   artificial and faithless; in short, to find himself arid, languishing,
   weary of God, dissipated in mind, and so far separated from every
   gracious thought as to be tempted to despair. Such are examples of some
   of the spoliations which now desolate myself; but there is an infinity
   of others which God apportions to each one according to his own wise
   purposes.

   Let no one tell me that these are only empty imaginations. Can we doubt
   that God acts immediately in the soul? that He so acts as to make it
   die to self? that, after having subdued the grosser passions, He
   attacks all the subtle resources of self-love within, especially in
   those souls who have generously and without reserve delivered
   themselves up to the operations of his grace? The more He would purify
   them, the more He exercises them interiorly. The world has neither eyes
   to see nor ears to hear these trials; but the world is blind; its
   wisdom is dead; it cannot coexist with the Spirit of truth. "The things
   of God," says the Apostle, "knoweth no man but the Spirit of God;" "the
   Spirit searcheth the deep things of God." (1 Cor. ii. 10,11.)

   We are not, at first, accustomed to this interior supervision, which
   thus tends to raze us to the foundation. We are willing to be silent
   and recollected; to suffer all things; to be at the disposal of
   Providence, like a man passively trusting himself to the current of a
   river; but we dare not yet risk listening to the interior voice,
   calling us to the sacrifices which God is preparing. We are like the
   child Samuel, who did not yet know the Lord; when the Lord called, he
   thought it was Eli, but he was told that he had been dreaming, and that
   no one spoke to him. Just so, we are uncertain whether it may not be
   some imagination which would carry us too far. Often the high-priest
   Eli, that is, our spiritual advisers, tell us that we have been
   dreaming, and bid us lie down again. But God does not leave us, and
   continues to wake us, until we lend an ear to what He has to say.

   If it were a matter of visions, apparitions, revelations, extraordinary
   illuminations, miracles, things contrary to true teaching, we should be
   right in not being detained by them. But when God has led us to a
   certain point of abandonment, and we subsequently have an interior
   conviction that He still desires us to give up certain innocent things,
   the tendency of all which is only to make us more simple and more
   profoundly dead to self, can it be an illusion to yield to such
   drawings? Probably no one follows them without good counsel. The
   repugnance which our wisdom and self-love manifest to them, is a
   sufficient evidence that they are of grace; for we see that we are only
   hindered from following them by selfish considerations. The more we
   fear to do these things, the more we have need to do them; for it is a
   fear which arises only from delicacy, want of pliability and attachment
   either to our pleasures or our views. We must die to all the sentiments
   of the natural life. Thus every pretext for retreat is cut off by the
   conviction in the depths of the soul, that the sacrifices required will
   assist in causing us to die.

   Ease and promptness in yielding to these movements, are the means by
   which souls make the greatest advances. Those who are ingenuous enough
   never to hesitate, soon make incredible progress. Others argue, and
   never fail to find a sufficient reason for not following the interior
   monitor. They are willing and not willing; they want to wait for
   certainties; they search about for advisers, who will bid them not do
   what they are afraid of doing; they stop at every step, and look back;
   then languish in irresolution, and insensibly estrange the Spirit of
   God. At first they grieve Him by their hesitation; then they irritate
   Him by formal resistance, and finally quench his operations by repeated
   opposition.

   While they thus resist, they find pretexts both to conceal and justify
   the resistance; but they insensibly grow dry; they lose their
   simplicity, and, make what effort they may to deceive themselves, they
   are not at peace; there is always at the bottom of the conscience, a
   feeling of reproach that they have been wanting toward God. But as God
   becomes more distant, because they are departing from Him, the soul
   becomes hardened by degrees. It is no longer peaceful; but it no longer
   seeks true peace; on the contrary, it wanders farther and farther from
   it, by seeking it where it is not; like a dislocated bone, a continual
   source of pain, and out of its natural position, yet, it manifests no
   tendency to resume its place, but, on the contrary, binds itself fast
   in its false relations.

   Ah! how much to be pitied is that soul which is just beginning to
   reject the secret invitations of God, when he demands that it shall die
   to all! At first, it is but an atom; but the atom becomes a mountain,
   and soon forms a sort of chaos between it and God. We play deaf when
   God demands a lowly simplicity; we are afraid to listen; we should be
   glad enough to be able to convince ourselves that we had not heard; we
   say so, but are not persuaded. We get into a tumult; we doubt all our
   past experience; and the graces which had served the most effectually
   to make us humble and simple before God, begin to look like illusions.
   We seek without, for spiritual advisers who may calm the trouble
   within; we readily find them, for there are so many, gifted even with
   much knowledge and piety, who have yet but little experience.

   In this condition, the more we strive to recover, the sicker we get. We
   are like the wounded deer, bearing in his side the fatal arrow; the
   more he struggles through the woods to be delivered of his enemy, the
   more deeply he buries it in his body. Alas! "Who hath hardened himself
   against Him and hath prospered." (Job ix. 4.) Can God, who is Himself
   the true Peace, leave that heart peaceful which opposes itself to his
   designs? Such a person is like one with an unknown disorder. Physicians
   employ their art in vain to give him any solace. You behold him sad,
   depressed, languishing; no food, no remedy can avail to do him good; he
   dies day by day. Can we wonder that, wandering from the true way, we
   should ceaselessly continue to stray farther and farther from the right
   course?

   But, as you will say, the commencement of these things is a small
   matter; true, but the end is deplorable. In the sacrifice which we made
   when we devoted ourselves wholly to God, we reserved nothing and felt
   happy in so doing, while we were looking at things with a general view
   and at a distance; but when God takes us at our word and accepts our
   offer in detail, we are made aware of a thousand repugnances, the
   existence of which we had not so much as suspected before. Our courage
   fails; frivolous excuses are suggested to flatter our feeble and
   tempted souls; then we hesitate and doubt whether it is our duty to
   obey; we do only the half of what God requires of us, and we mix with
   the divine influence a something of self, trying still to secure some
   nutriment for that corrupt interior which wills not to die. A jealous
   God retires: the soul begins to shut its eyes, that it may not see that
   it has no longer the courage to act, and God leaves it to its weakness
   and corruption, because it will be so left. But think of the magnitude
   of its error!

   The more we have received of God, the more ought we to render. We have
   received prevenient love and singular grace: we have received the gift
   of pure and unselfish love, which so many pious souls have never
   tasted; God has spared nothing to possess us wholly; He has become the
   interior Bridegroom; He has taken pains to do everything for his
   bride--but He is infinitely jealous. Do not wonder at the exacting
   nature of his jealousy! What is its object? Is it talents,
   illuminations, the regular practice of external virtues? Not at all; He
   is easy and condescending in such matters. Love is only jealous about
   love; the whole of his scrutiny falls upon the state of the will. He
   cannot share the heart of the spouse with any other; still less can He
   tolerate the excuses by which she would convince herself that her heart
   is justly divided; this it is that lights the devouring fires of his
   jealousy. As long, O spouse! as pure and disinterested love shall guide
   thee, so long the Bridegroom will bear with inexhaustible patience all
   thy wrong doing through weakness or inadvertence, without prejudice to
   the purity of thy love; but from the moment that thou shalt refuse
   anything that God asks, and begin to deceive thyself in the refusal,
   from that moment He will regard thee as a faithless spouse, and one
   seeking to conceal her infidelity!

   How many souls, after having made great sacrifices, fall into these
   ways! False wisdom is the source of the whole difficulty; it is not so
   much through defect of courage as through excess of reason, that we are
   arrested at this point. It is true that when God has called souls to
   this state of absolute sacrifice, he treats them in accordance with the
   gifts He has lavished upon them; He is insatiable for deaths, losses,
   renunciation; He is jealous of his own gifts even, because the
   excellence of the blessings secretly breeds within us a sort of
   self-condfidence. All must be destroyed, every vestige must perish! We
   have abandoned everything--and He comes now to take everything, leaving
   us absolutely nothing. If there be the smallest thing to which we
   cling, however good it may appear, there He comes sword in hand, and
   cuts into the remotest corner of the soul. If we are still fearful in
   any recess, to that spot He comes, for He always attacks us in our
   weakest points. He pushes hard, without giving us time to breathe. Do
   you wonder? Can we be dead while we yet breathe? We desire that God
   would give us the death-stroke; but we long to die without pain; we
   would die to our own will by the power of the will itself; we want to
   lose all and still hold all. Ah! what agony, what distress, when God
   has brought us to the end of our strength! We faint like a patient
   under a painful surgical operation. But the comparison is nought, for
   the object of the surgeon is to give us life--that of God to make us
   die.

   Poor souls! weak in spirit! how these last blows overwhelm you! The
   very apprehension of them makes you tremble and fall back! How few are
   there who make out to cross the frightful desert! Scarcely shall two or
   three behold the promised land! Woe to those from whom God had reason
   to expect everything, and who do not accept the grace! Woe to him who
   resists the interior guidance! strange sin, that against the Holy
   Spirit! Unpardonable either in this world or in the next, what is it
   but resistance to the divine monitor within? He who resists the Spirit,
   striving for his conversion shall be punished in this world by
   affliction, and in the next by the pains of hell. Happy is he who never
   hesitates; who fears only that he follows with too little readiness;
   who would rather do too much against self than too little! Blessed is
   he who, when asked for a sample, boldly presents his entire stock, and
   suffers God to cut from the whole cloth! happy he who, esteeming
   himself as nothing, puts God to no necessity of sparing him! Thrice
   happy he whom all this does not affright!

   It is thought that this state is a painful one; it is a mistake; here
   is peace and liberty; here the heart, detached from everything, is
   immeasurably enlarged, so as to become illimitable; nothing cramps it;
   and in accordance with the promise, it becomes, in a certain sense, one
   with God himself.

   Thou only O my God! canst give the peace which is then enjoyed! The
   less timid the soul is in the sacrifice of itself, the greater liberty
   does it acquire! At length, when it no longer hesitates to lose all and
   forget self, it possesses all. It is true that it is not a conscious
   possession, so that the soul addressed itself as happy, for that would
   be to return to self after having quitted it forever; but it is an
   image of the condition of the blessed, who will be always ravished by
   the contemplation of God, without having a moment, during the whole of
   eternity, to think of themselves and their felicity. They are so
   satisfied in these transports, that they will be eternally rejoicing,
   without once saying to themselves that they are happy.

   Thou grantest to those souls who never resist thee, O bridegroom of
   souls! even in this life, a foretaste of this felicity. They will all
   things and nothing. As it is things created which hem up the heart,
   these souls, being restrained by no attachment to the creature, and no
   reflections of self, enter as it were into thine immensity! Nothing
   stops them; they become continually more and more lost; but though
   their capacity should increase to an infinite extent, Thou wouldst fill
   it; they are always satisfied. They do not say that they are happy, but
   feel that they are so; they do not posses happiness, but their
   happiness possesses them. Let any one ask them at any moment, Do you
   will to suffer what you suffer? Would you have what you have not? They
   will answer without hesitation and without reflection, I will to suffer
   what I suffer, and to want that which I have not; I will everything
   which God wills; I will nothing else.

   Such, my God, is true and pure worship in spirit and in truth. Thou
   seekest such to worship Thee, but scarce findest them! There are few
   but seek self in thy gifts, instead of seeking Thee alone in the cross
   and in spoliation. Most seek to guide Thee instead of being guided by
   Thee. They give themselves up to Thee, that they may become great, but
   withdraw when they are required to become little. They say they are
   attached to nothing, and are overwhelmed by the smallest losses. They
   desire to possess Thee, but are not willing to lose self, that they may
   be possessed by Thee. This is not loving Thee; it is desiring to be
   loved by Thee. O God, the creature knows not to what end Thou hast made
   him; teach him, and write in the depths of his soul, that the clay must
   suffer itself to be shaped at the will of the potter!
     __________________________________________________________________

  XXIII. ON CHRISTIAN PERFECTION.

   Christian Perfection is not that rigorous, tedious, cramping thing that
   many imagine. It demands only an entire surrender of everything to God
   from the depths of the soul, and the moment this takes place, whatever
   is done for Him becomes easy. They who are God's without reserve, are
   in every state content; for they will only what He wills, and desire to
   do for Him whatever he desires them to do; they strip themselves of
   everything, and in this nakedness find all things restored an hundred
   fold. Peace of conscience, liberty of spirit, the sweet abandonment of
   themselves and theirs into the hand of God, the joy of perceiving the
   light always increasing in their hearts, and finally the freedom of
   their souls from the bondage of the fears and desires of this world,
   these things constitute that return of happiness which the true
   children of God receive an hundred fold in the midst of their crosses,
   while they remain faithful.

   They are sacrificed, it is true, but it is to that which they love
   best; they suffer, but they will to endure all that they do receive,
   and prefer that anguish to all the false joys of the world; their
   bodies are subject to excruciating pain; their imaginations are
   troubled; their minds become languid and weak, but the will is firm and
   peacefully quiet in the interior of the soul, and responds a joyful
   Amen! to every stroke from the hand that would perfect the sacrifice.

   What God requires of us, is a will which is no longer divided between
   Him and any creature; a simple, pliable state of will which desires
   what He desires, rejects nothing but what He rejects, and wills without
   reserve what He wills, and under no pretext wills what He does not. In
   this state of mind, all things are proper for us; our amusements, even,
   are acceptable in his sight.

   Blessed is he who thus give himself to God! He is delivered from his
   passions, from the opinions of men, from their malice, from the tyranny
   of their maxims, from their cold and miserable raillery, from the
   misfortunes which the world attributes to chance, from the infidelity
   and fickleness of friends, from the artifices and snares of enemies,
   from the wretchedness and shortness of life, from the horrors of an
   ungodly death, from the cruel remorse that follows sinful pleasures,
   and finally from the everlasting condemnation of God!

   The true Christian is delivered from this innumerable multitude of
   evils, because, putting his will into the hands of God, he wills only
   what He wills, and thus finds comfort in the midst of all his suffering
   in the way of faith, and its attendant hope.

   What weakness it is, then, to be fearful of consecrating ourselves to
   God, and of getting too far into so desirable a state!

   Happy those who throw themselves, as it were, headlong, and with their
   eyes shut, into the arms of "the Father of mercies, and the God of all
   comfort!" (2 Cor. i. 3.) Their whole desire then, is to know what is
   the will of God respecting them; and they fear nothing so much as not
   perceiving the whole of his requirements. So soon as they behold a new
   light in his law, they are transported with joy, like a miser at the
   finding of a treasure.

   No matter what cross may overwhelm the true child of God, he wills
   everything that happens, and would not have anything removed which his
   Father appoints; the more he loves God, the more is he filled with
   content; and the most stringent perfection, far from being a burthen,
   only renders his yoke the lighter.

   What folly to fear to be too devoted to God! to fear to be happy! to
   fear to love the will of God in all things! to fear to have too much
   courage under inevitable crosses, too much consolation in the love of
   God, and too great a detachment from the passions which make us
   miserable!

   Let us refuse, then, to set our affections upon things of the earth
   that we may set them exclusively upon God. I do not say, that we must
   abandon them entirely; for if our lives be already moral and well
   ordered, we have only to change the secret motive of our actions into
   Love, and we may continue almost the same course of life. God does not
   overturn our conditions nor the duties attached to them, but we may go
   on doing that now for the service of God which we did formerly to
   satisfy the world, and to please ourselves. There will only be this
   difference: instead of being harassed by pride, by overbearing passion,
   and by the malicious censures of the world, we shall act with liberty,
   with courage, and with hope in God. We shall be animated with
   confidence; the expectation of things eternal, which advance as things
   temporal recede from us, will support us in the midst of suffering; the
   love of God, who will cause us to perceive how great is his love toward
   us, will lend us wings to fly in his ways, and to raise us above all
   our miseries. Is this hard to believe? Experience will convince us. "O
   taste and see that the Lord is good!" says the Psalmist. (Ps. xxxiv.
   8.)

   The Son of God says to every Christian without exception, "If any man
   will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and
   follow me." (Matt. xix. 24.) The broad way leadeth unto destruction; we
   must walk in the strait way, though there be few that travel therein.
   It is only the violent who take the Kingdom by force. We must be born
   again, renounce and hate ourselves, become children, be poor in spirit,
   mourn that we may be comforted, and not be of this world, which is
   cursed because of offences.

   Many are affrighted at these truths, and their fear arises from this:
   that while they know the exacting nature of religion, they are ignorant
   of its gifts, and of the spirit of love which renders everything easy.
   They are not aware that religion leads to the highest perfection, while
   bestowing peace through a principle of love that smooths every rough
   place.

   They who are in truth and indeed wholly consecrated to God, are ever
   happy. They prove that the yoke of our Redeemer is easy and his burden
   light; that in Him is the peace of the soul, and that He gives rest to
   them that are weary and heavy laden, according to his own blessed
   promise. But how unhappy are those poor, weak souls, who are divided
   between God and the world! They will and they do not will; they are
   lacerated at once by their passions and their remorse; they are afraid
   of the judgments of God and of the opinions of men; they dislike the
   evil, but are ashamed of the good; they suffer the pains of virtue,
   without enjoying its consolations. Ah! could they but have a little
   courage,--just enough to despise the vain conversation, the cold
   sneers, and the rash judgments of men,--what peace would they not enjoy
   in the bosom of God!

   It is dangerous to our salvation, unworthy of God and of ourselves, and
   destructive even of our peace of mind, to desire to remain always in
   our present position. Our whole life is only given us that we may
   advance with rapid strides towards our heavenly country. The world
   recedes like a deceptive shadow, and eternity already approaches to
   receive us. Why do we linger and look behind, while the light of the
   Father of Mercies is shining upon us from before? Let us make haste to
   reach the Kingdom of God.

   All the vain pretexts which are used to cover our reservations toward
   God are instantly dissipated by the first commandment of the law: "Thou
   shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
   and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind." (Luke x. 27.) Notice
   how many expressions are here brought together by the Holy Spirit, to
   forestall all the reservations the soul might make to the prejudice of
   this jealous Love; not only with the whole extent and strength of the
   soul, but with all the intensity of the intellect. How then can we
   conclude that we love Him if we cannot make up our minds to receive his
   law, and to apply ourselves at once to fulfil all his blessed will?

   They who fear that they shall discover too clearly what this love
   demands, are very far indeed from possessing the active and incessant
   affection required by this commandment.

   There is but one way in which God should be loved, and that is to take
   no step except with Him and for Him, and to follow, with a generous
   self-abandonment, everything which He requires.

   They who live in some self-denial, but have still a wish to enjoy a
   little of the world, think that this is a small matter; but they run
   the risk of being included in the number of those lukewarm ones whom
   God will spue out of his mouth. (Rev. iii. 16.)

   God is not pleased with the souls that say, "thus far will I go and no
   farther." Should the creature prescribe laws to the Creator? What would
   a master say of his servants, or a king of his subjects, who should be
   willing to serve him, but only after their own fashion? who should be
   afraid of becoming too much interested in his service and his
   interests, and who should be ashamed publicly to acknowledge themselves
   attached to him? Or rather, what will the King of kings say to us if we
   serve Him in this wicked manner?

   The time is not far distant; it is near, it is even at hand; let us
   hasten to anticipate it; let us love that eternal beauty which never
   grows old, and which preserves in endless youth those who love nought
   but it; let us despise this miserable world which is already falling to
   pieces on every side! Have we not beheld for years, that they, who
   to-day are high in honor and in the esteem of men, to-morrow, surprised
   by death, are laid side by side in the tomb? This poor world, the
   object of so much insane attachment, we are daily about to leave; it is
   but misery, vanity and folly; a phantom,--the very fashion of which
   passeth away! (1 Cor. vii. 31.)
     __________________________________________________________________

  XXIV. THE WAY OF NAKED FAITH AND PURE LOVE IS BETTER AND MORE CERTAIN THAN
  THAT OF ILLUMINATIONS AND SENSIBLE DELIGHTS.

   Those who are attached to God, only so far as they enjoy pleasure and
   consolation, resemble those who followed the Lord, not to hear his
   teaching, but because they did eat of the loaves and were filled. (John
   vi. 26.) They are ready to say with Peter, "Master, it is good for us
   to be here; and let us make three tabernacles; (Mark ix. 5); but they
   know not what they say. After being intoxicated with the joys of the
   mountain they deny the Son of God and refuse to follow him to Calvary.
   Not only do they desire delights, but they seek illuminations also; the
   mind is curious to behold, while the heart requires to be filled with
   soft and flattering emotions. Is this dying to self? Is this the way in
   which the just shall live by faith? (Heb. x. 38.)

   They desire to have extraordinary revelations, which may be regarded as
   supernatural gifts, and a mark of the special favor of God. Nothing is
   so flattering to self-love; all the greatness of the world at once
   could not so inflate the heart; these supernatural gifts nourish in
   secret the life of nature. It is an ambition of the most refined
   character, as it is wholly spiritual; but it is merely ambition; a
   desire to feel, to enjoy, to posses God and his gifts, to behold his
   light, to discern spirits, to prophesy, in short, to be an
   extraordinarily gifted person; for the enjoyment of illuminations and
   delights, leads the soul little by little towards a secret coveting of
   all these things.

   Yet the apostle shows us a more excellent way, (1 Cor. xii. 31,) for
   which he inspires us with a holy emulation; it is the way of charity
   which seeketh not her own, (1 Cor. xiii. 5,) and desires not to be
   clothed upon, if we may adopt the apostle's language, but suffers
   herself to be unclothed. She is less in search of pleasure than of God,
   whose will she longs to fulfil. If she finds pleasure in devotion, she
   does not rest in it, but makes it serve to strengthen her weakness, as
   a convalescent uses a staff to aid in walking, but throws it aside on
   his restoration. In the same way the tender and child-like soul that
   God fed with milk in the beginning, suffers itself to be weaned when He
   sees it is time that it should be nourished upon strong meat.

   We must not be ever children, always hanging upon the breast of
   heavenly consolations; we must put away childish things with St. Paul.
   (1 Cor. xiii. 11.) Our early joys were excellent to attract us, to
   detach us from gross and worldly pleasures by others of a purer kind,
   and to lead us into a life of prayer and recollection; but to be
   constantly in a state of enjoyment that takes away the feeling of the
   cross, and to live in a fervor of devotion, that continually keeps
   paradise open, this is not dying upon the cross and becoming nothing.

   This life of illumination and sensible delights, is a very dangerous
   snare, if we become so attached to it as to desire nothing farther; for
   he who has no other attraction to prayer, will quit both it and God,
   whenever this source of his gratification is dried up. St. Theresa
   says, you know, that a vast number of souls leave off praying at the
   very moment when their devotion is beginning to be real. How many are
   there who, in consequence of too tender rearing in Jesus Christ, and
   too great fondness for the milk of his word, go back and abandon the
   interior life as soon as God undertakes to wean them! We need not be
   astonished at this, for they mistake the portico of the temple for the
   very sanctuary itself; they desire the death of their gross external
   passions, that they may lead a delicious life of self-satisfaction
   within. Hence so much infidelity and disappointment, even among those
   who appeared the most fervent and the most devoted; those who have
   talked the loudest of abandonment, of death to self, of the darkness of
   faith and of desolation, are often the most surprised and discouraged,
   when they really experience these things, and their consolation is
   taken away. O how excellent is the way pointed out by John of the
   Cross, who would have us believe without seeing, and love without
   desiring to feel!

   This attachment to sensible delights, is the fruitful source of all our
   illusions; souls are earthly in desiring something tangible, as it
   were, before they can feel firm. But this is all wrong; it is these
   very things of sense that produce vacillation; we think, while the
   pleasure lasts, that we shall never desert God; we say in our
   prosperity, that we shall never be moved (Ps. xxx. 6.); but the moment
   our intoxication is over, we give up all for lost, thus substituting
   our own pleasure and imagination in place of God. Naked faith, alone,
   is a sure guard against illusion. When our foundation is not upon any
   imagination, feeling, pleasure, or extraordinary illumination; when we
   rest upon God only in pure and naked faith, in the simplicity of the
   gospel receiving the consolations which He sends, but dwelling in none;
   abstaining from judging, and ever obedient; believing that it is easy
   to be deceived, and that others may be able to set us right; in short,
   acting every moment with simplicity and an upright intention, following
   the light of the faith of the present moment; then we are indeed in a
   way that is but little subject to illusion.

   Experience will demonstrate, better than anything else, how much more
   certain this path is than that of illuminations and sensible delights.
   Whoever will try it, will soon find that this way of naked faith,
   rigidly followed, is the profoundest and most complete death of self.
   Interior delights and revelations indemnify our self-love for all its
   external sacrifices, and cherish a secret and refined life of nature;
   but to suffer ourselves to be stripped within and without at once,
   without by Providence, and within by the night of pure faith, this is a
   total sacrifice, and a state the farthest possible from self-deception.

   Those, then, who seek to guard against being deceived by a constant
   succession of emotions and certainties, are by that very course
   exposing themselves most surely to such a result. On the other hand,
   those who follow the leadings of the love that strips them and the
   faith that walks in darkness, without seeking any other support, avoid
   all the sources of error and illusion. The author of the Imitation of
   Christ (book iii.) tells you, that if God takes away your inward
   delights, it should be your pleasure to remain pleasureless. O how
   beloved of God is a soul thus crucified, that rests calmly upon the
   cross, and desires only to expire with Jesus! It is not true to say
   that we are afraid of having lost God, on being deprived of feeling; it
   is impatience under the trial, the restlessness of a pampered and
   dainty nature, a search for some support for self-love, a weariness of
   abandonment, and a secret return to self, after our consecration to
   God. O God, where are they who stop not in the road to death? If they
   persevere unto the end, they shall receive a crown of life.
     __________________________________________________________________

  XXV. ON THE PRESENCE OF GOD.

   The true source of all our perfection is contained in the command of
   God in Abraham, "Walk before me, and be thou perfect." (Gen. xvii. 1.)

   The presence of God calms the soul, and gives it quiet and repose even
   during the day, and in the midst of occupation--but we must be given up
   to God without reserve.

   When we have once found God, we have nothing to seek among men; we must
   make the sacrifice of our dearest friendships; the best of friends has
   entered into our hearts, that jealous Bridegroom who requires the whole
   of it for himself.

   It takes no great time to love God, to be refreshed by his presence, to
   elevate our hearts to Him, or to worship Him in the depths of our soul,
   to offer to Him all we do and all we suffer; this is the true kingdom
   of God within us, which cannot be disturbed.

   When the distraction of the senses and the vivacity of the imagination
   hinder the soul from a sweet and peaceful state of recollection, we
   should at least be calm as to the state of the will: in that case, the
   will to be recollected is a sufficient state of recollection for the
   time being. We must return toward God, and do everything which He would
   have us do with a right intention.

   We must endeavor to awake within ourselves, from time to time, the
   desire of being devoted to God in all the extent of our powers; in our
   intellect, to know him and think on him, and in our will, to love him.
   We must desire too, that our outward senses may be consecrated to him
   in all their operations.

   Let us be careful how we voluntarily engage, either externally or
   internally, in matters which cause such distraction of the will and
   intellect, and so draw them out of themselves that they find difficulty
   in re-entering and finding God.

   The moment we discover that anything causes excessive pleasure or joy
   within us, let us separate our heart from it, and, to prevent it from
   seeking its repose in the creature, let us present it to God, the true
   object of love, the sovereign good. If we are faithful in breaking up
   all attachment to the creature, that is, if we prevent its entering
   into those depths of the soul which our Lord reserves for Himself, to
   dwell there and to be there respected, adored, and loved, we shall soon
   experience that pure joy which He never fails to give to a soul freed
   and detached from all human affections. [3]

   Whenever we perceive within us anxious desires for anything, whatever
   it may be, and find that nature is hurrying us with too much haste to
   do what is to be done, whether it be to say something, see something,
   or to do something, let us stop short, and repress the precipitancy of
   our thoughts and the agitation of our actions--for God has said, that
   his Spirit does not dwell in disquiet.

   Be careful not to take too much interest in what is going on around
   you, nor to be much engaged in it--it is a fruitful source of
   distraction. As soon as we have found what it is that God requires of
   us in anything that comes up, let us stop there and separate ourselves
   from all the rest. By that means we shall always preserve the depths of
   the soul free and equable, and rid ourselves of many things that
   embarrass our hearts, and prevent them from turning easily toward God.

   An excellent means of preserving our interior solitude and liberty of
   soul, is to make it a rule to put an end, at the close of every action,
   to all reflections upon it, all reflex acts of self-love, whether of a
   vain joy or sorrow. Happy is he whose mind contains only what is
   necessary, and who thinks of nothing except when it is time to think of
   it! so that it is God who excites the impression, by calling us to
   perform his will as soon as it is exhibited, rather than the mind
   laboriously foreseeing and seeking it. In short, let us be accustomed
   to recollect ourselves during the day and in the midst of our
   occupations, by a simple view of God. Let us silence by that means all
   the movements of our hearts, when they appear in the least agitated.
   Let us separate ourselves from all that does not come from God. Let us
   suppress our superfluous thoughts and reveries. Let us utter no useless
   word. Let us seek God within us, and we shall find Him without fail,
   and with Him, joy and peace.

   While outwardly busy, let us be more occupied with God than with
   everything else. To be rightly engaged, we must be in his presence and
   employed for Him. At the sight of the Majesty of God, our interior
   ought to become calm and remain tranquil. Once a single word of the
   Saviour suddenly calmed a furiously agitated sea: one look of his at
   us, and of ours toward Him, ought always to perform the same miracle
   within us.

   We must often raise our hearts to God. He will purify, enlighten, and
   direct them. Such was the daily practice of the sacred Psalmist: "I
   have set the Lord always before me." (Ps. xvi. 8.) Let us often employ
   the beautiful words of the same holy prophet, "Whom have I in heaven
   but thee? And there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee! God
   is the strength of my heart and my portion forever!" (Ps. lxxiii. 25.)

   We must not wait for a leisure hour, when we can bar our doors; the
   moment that is employed in regretting that we have no opportunity to be
   recollected, might be profitably spent in recollection. Let us turn our
   hearts toward God in a simple, familiar spirit, full of confidence in
   him. The most interrupted moments, even while eating or listening to
   others, are valuable. Tiresome and idle talk in our presence, instead
   of annoying, will afford us the delight of employing the interval in
   seeking God. Thus all things work together for good to them that love
   God.

   We must read according to our necessity and desire, but with frequent
   interruptions, for the purpose of recollection. A word or two, simple
   and full of the Spirit of God, will be to us as hidden manna. We forget
   the words, but the effect remains; they operate in secret, and the soul
   is fed and enriched.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [3] The reader will not understand by this, that the soul, in a state
   of true abandonment, does not exhibit affection for those about it. As,
   by that process, it commences to see God as He is, it also begins to be
   like Him, and is all love. Its whole existence, like that of God, may
   be summed up in the single word "Love." But its love is divine, not
   human; its affection for all creatures of God, in their respective
   relations, is higher, and deeper, and holier than it ever was
   before.--Editor.
     __________________________________________________________________

  XXVI. ON CONFORMITY TO THE WILL OF GOD.

   The essence of virtue consists in the attitude of the will. This is
   what the Lord would teach us when he said, "The kingdom of God is
   within you." (Luke xvii. 21.) It is not a question of extensive
   knowledge, of splendid talents, nor even of great deeds; it is a simple
   matter of having a heart and loving. Outward works are the fruits and
   consequences of loving, and the spring of all good things is at the
   bottom of the soul.

   There are some virtues which are appropriate to certain conditions, and
   not to others; some are good at one time, and some at another; but an
   upright will is profitable for all times and all places. That kingdom
   of God which is within us, consists in our willing whatever God wills,
   always, in everything, and without reservation; and thus his kingdom
   comes; for his will is then done as it is in Heaven, since we will
   nothing but what is dictated by his sovereign pleasure.

   Blessed are the poor in spirit! Blessed are they who are stripped of
   everything, even of their own wills, that they may no longer belong to
   themselves! How poor in spirit does he become who has given up all
   things to God! But how is it that our will becomes right, when it
   unreservedly conforms to that of God? We will whatever He wills; what
   He does not will, we do not; we attach our feeble wills to that
   all-powerful one that regulates everything. Thus nothing can ever come
   to pass against our wishes; for nothing can happen contrary to the will
   of God, and we find in his good pleasure an inexhaustible source of
   peace and consolation.

   The interior life is the beginning of the blessed peace of the saints,
   who eternally cry, Amen, Amen! We adore, we praise, we bless God in
   everything; we see Him incessantly, and in all things his paternal hand
   is the sole object of our contemplation. There are no longer any evils;
   for even the most terrible that come upon us, work together for good,
   as St. Paul says, to those that love God. (Rom. viii. 28.) Can the
   suffering that God destines to purify and make us worthy of himself, be
   called an evil?

   Let us cast all our cares, then, into the bosom of so good a Father,
   and suffer Him to do as He pleases. Let us be content to adopt his will
   in all points, and to abandon our own absolutely and forever. How can
   we retain anything of our own, when we do not even belong to ourselves?
   The slave has nothing; how much less, then, should we own anything, who
   in ourselves are but nothingness and sin, and who are indebted for
   everything to pure grace! God has only bestowed upon us a will, free
   and capable of self-possession, that we may the more generously
   recompense the gift by returning it to its rightful owner.

   We have nothing but our wills only; all the rest belongs elsewhere.
   Disease removes life and health; riches make to themselves wings;
   intellectual talents depend upon the state of the body. The only thing
   that really belongs to us is our will, and it is of this, therefore,
   that God is especially jealous, for He gave it to us, not that we
   should retain it, but that we should return it to Him, whole as we
   received it, and without the slightest reservation.

   If the least desire remain, or the smallest hesitation, it is robbing
   God, contrary to the order of creation; for all things come from Him,
   and to Him they are all due.

   Alas! how many souls there are full of self, and desirous of doing good
   and serving God, but in such a way as to suit themselves; who desire to
   impose rules upon God as to his manner of drawing them to Himself. They
   want to serve and possess Him, but they are not willing to abandon
   themselves to Him, and be possessed by Him.

   What a resistance they offer to Him, even when they appear so full of
   zeal and fervor! It is certain that in one sense, their spiritual
   abundance becomes an obstacle to their progress; for they hold it all,
   even their virtues, in appropriation, and constantly seek self, even in
   good. O how superior to such fervid and illuminated souls, walking
   always in virtue, in a road of their own choice, is that humble heart
   that renounces its own life, and every selfish movement, and dismisses
   all will except such as God gives from moment to moment, in accordance
   with his Gospel and Providence!

   Herein lies the meaning of those words of the Lord; "If any man will
   come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow
   me." (Matt. xvi. 24; Luke xiv. 33.) We must follow Jesus Christ, step
   by step, and not open up a path for ourselves. We can only follow Him
   by denying ourselves; and what is this but unreservedly abandoning
   every right over ourselves? And so St. Paul tells us; "Ye are not your
   own (1 Cor. vi. 19): no, not a thing remains that belongs to us! Alas
   for him that resumes possession of anything after once abandoning it!

   To desire to serve God in one place rather than in another, in this way
   rather than in that, is not this desiring to serve Him in our own way
   rather than in his? But to be equally ready for all things, to will
   everything and nothing, to leave ourselves in his hands, like a toy in
   the hands of a child, to set no bounds to our abandonment, inasmuch as
   the perfect reign of God cannot abide them, this is really denying
   ourselves; this is treating Him like a God, and ourselves like
   creatures made solely for his use.
     __________________________________________________________________

  XXVII. GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR ATTAINING INWARD PEACE.

   There is no peace to them that resist God: if there be joy in the
   world, it is reserved for a pure conscience; the whole earth is full of
   tribulation and anguish to those who do not possess it.

   How different is the peace of God from that of the world! It calms the
   passions, preserves the purity of the conscience, is inseparable from
   righteousness, unites us to God and strengthens us against temptations.
   The peace of the soul consists in an absolute resignation to the will
   of God.

   "Martha, Martha, thou are careful and troubled about many things; but
   one thing is needful." (Luke x. 41.) The pain we suffer from so many
   occurrences, arises from the fact that we are not entirely abandoned to
   God in everything that happens.

   Let us put all things, then, into his hands, and offer them to Him in
   our hearts, as a sacrifice beforehand. From the moment that you cease
   to desire anything according to your own judgment, and begin to will
   everything just as God wills it, you will be free from your former
   tormenting reflections and anxieties about your own concerns; you will
   no longer have anything to conceal or take care of.

   Until then, you will be troubled, vacillating in your views and
   enjoyments, easily dissatisfied with others and but little satisfied
   with yourself, and full of reserve and distrust. Your good intentions,
   until they become truly humble and simple, will only torment you; your
   piety, however sincere, will be the occasion of more internal reproach
   then of support or consolation. But if you will abandon your whole
   heart to God, you will be full of peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.

   Alas for you, if you will regard man in the work of God! In our choice
   of a guide, men must be counted as nothing; the slightest respect for
   their opinion dries up the stream of grace, and increases our
   indecision. We suffer and we displease God besides.

   How can we refuse to bestow all our love upon God, who first loved us
   with the tender love of a Father, pitying our frailty, and well knowing
   the mire from which we have been dragged? When a soul is filled with
   this love, it enjoys peace of conscience, it is content and happy, it
   requires neither greatness nor reputation, nor pleasure, nor any of the
   perishing gifts of time; it desires only the will of God, and watches
   incessantly in the joyful expectation of its Spouse.
     __________________________________________________________________

  XXVIII. PURE LOVE ONLY CAN SUFFER ARIGHT AND LOVE ITS SUFFERINGS.

   We know that we must suffer, and that we deserve it; nevertheless, we
   are always surprised at affliction, as if we thought we neither merited
   nor had need of it. It is only true and pure love that delights to
   endure, for nothing else is perfectly abandoned. Resignation induces us
   to bear pain, but there is a something in it which is afflicted in
   suffering, and resists. The resignation that measures out its
   abandonment to God with selfish reflection, is willing to suffer, but
   is constantly examining to ascertain whether it suffers acceptably. In
   fact, the resigned soul is composed as it were of two persons; one
   keeping the other in subjection, and watching lest it should revolt.

   In pure love, unselfish and abandoned, the soul is fed in silence on
   the cross, and on union with the crucified Saviour, without any
   reflections on the severity of its sufferings. There exists but a
   single, simple will, which permits God to see it just as it is, without
   endeavoring to behold itself. It says nothing, does nothing. What then
   does it do? It suffers. And is this all? Yea, all; it has nothing else
   to do but to suffer. Love can be heard easily enough, without speech or
   thought. It does all that it is required to do, which is, to have no
   will when it is stripped of all consolation. The purest of all loves is
   a will so filled with that of God, that there remains nothing else.

   What a consolation is it to think that we are then rid of so many
   anxieties about our exercise of patience and the other virtues in the
   sight of those about us? It is enough to be humbled and abandoned in
   the midst of suffering. This is not courage; it is something both more
   and less; less in the eyes of the ordinary class of Christians, more in
   the eyes of pure faith. It is a humiliation which raises the soul into
   all the greatness of God; a weakness which strips it of every resource,
   to bestow upon it his omnipotence. "When I am weak," says St. Paul,
   "then I am strong; I can do all things through Christ which
   strengtheneth me." (2 Cor. xii. 10; Phil. iv. 13.)

   It suffices then, to feed upon some short sentences suited to our state
   and our taste, with frequent interruptions to quiet the senses and make
   room for the inward spirit of recollection. We sometimes suffer,
   scarcely knowing that we are in distress; at other times we suffer, and
   know that we bear it ill, but we carry this second and heavier cross
   without impatience. True love goes ever straightforward, not in its own
   strength, but esteeming itself as nothing. Then indeed we are truly
   happy. The cross is no longer a cross when there is no self to suffer
   under it, and to appropriate its good and evil.
     __________________________________________________________________

  XXIX. INTERESTED AND DISINTERESTED LOVE HAVE EACH ITS APPROPRIATE SEASON.

   Why do the gifts of God confer more pleasure when they exist in
   ourselves than when they are conferred upon our neighbor, if we are not
   attached to self? If we prefer to see them in our possession rather
   than in that of those about us, we shall certainly be afflicted when we
   see them more perfect in them than they are in ourselves; and this
   constitutes envy. What is our duty then? We must rejoice that the will
   of God is done in us, and that it reigns there not for our happiness
   and perfection, but for his own good pleasure and glory.

   Now, take notice of two matters. The first is, that this distinction is
   not an empty subtlety; for God, in his desire to desolate the soul for
   its own perfection, causes it really to pass through these trials of
   self, and never lets it alone until He has deprived its love of selfish
   reflection and support. There is nothing so jealous, so exacting, and
   so searching as this principle of pure love; it cannot abide a thousand
   things that were imperceptible in our previous state; and what pious
   persons would call an unprofitable nicety, seems an essential point to
   the soul that is desirous of destroying self. As with gold in the
   furnace, the fire consumes all that is not gold, so it seems necessary
   that the heart should be melted with fervent heat, that the love of God
   may be rendered pure.

   The second remark is, that God does not pursue every soul in this way
   in the present life. There is an infinite number of truly pious persons
   whom He leaves in some degree under the dominion of self-love; these
   remains of self help to support them in the practice of virtue, and
   serve to purify them to a certain point.

   Scarce anything would be more injudicious or more dangerous than to
   deprive them of the contemplation of the grace of God in them as
   tending to their own personal perfection. The first class exercise
   disinterested gratitude; they are thankful to God for whatever He does
   in them, solely because He does it for his own glory; the second are
   also grateful, but partly because their own perfection is secured at
   the same time. If the former should endeavor to deprive the latter of
   this mixed motive and this interior comfort in self, in reference to
   grace, they would cause them as much injury as they would an infant by
   weaning it before it was able to eat; to take away the breast, would be
   to destroy it. We must never seek to deprive a soul of the food which
   still contains nutriment for it, and which God suffers to remain as a
   stay to its weakness. To forestall grace is to destroy it. Neither must
   the latter condemn the former because they do not see them as much
   concerned as themselves about their own perfection in the grace
   ministered unto them. God works in every one as he pleases; the wind
   bloweth where it listeth, (John iii. 8,) and as it listeth. The
   forgetfulness of self in the pure contemplation of God, is a state in
   which God can do in our souls whatever most pleases Himself. The
   important point is, that those who are still in a measure supported by
   self, should not be too anxious about the state of such as are in pure
   love, nor should these latter endeavor to make the former pass through
   the trials peculiar to a higher state of grace before God calls them to
   it.

  XXX. ON TRUE LIBERTY.

   When we are no longer embarrassed by the restless reflections of self,
   we begin to enjoy true liberty.

   False wisdom, on the other hand, always on the watch, ever occupied
   with self, constantly jealous of its own perfection, suffers severely
   whenever it is permitted to perceive the smallest speck of
   imperfection.

   Not that the man who is simple minded and detached from self, fails to
   labor toward the attainment of perfection; he is the more successful in
   proportion as he forgets himself, and never dreams of virtue in any
   other light than as something which accomplishes the will of God.

   The source of all our defects is the love of self; we refer everything
   to that, instead of to the love of God. Whoever, then, will labor to
   get rid of self, to deny him-self, according to the instructions of
   Christ, strikes at once at the root of every evil, and finds, in this
   simple abandonment of self, the germ of every good.

   Then those words of Scripture are heard within and understood, "Where
   the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." (2 Cor. iii. 17.) We
   neglect nothing to cause the kingdom of God to come both within and
   without; but in the midst of our frailties we are at peace. We would
   rather die than commit the slightest voluntary sin, but we have no fear
   for our reputation from the judgment of man. We court the reproach of
   Christ Jesus, and dwell in peace though surrounded by uncertainties;
   the judgments of God do not affright us, for we abandon ourselves to
   them, imploring his mercy according to our attainments in confidence,
   sacrifice, and absolute surrender. The greater the abandonments, the
   more flowing the peace; and in such a large place does it set us, that
   we are prepared for everything; we will everything and nothing; we are
   as guileless as babes.

   Our illumination from God discovers the lightest transgressions, but
   never discourages. We walk before Him; but if we stumble, we hasten to
   resume our way, and have no watchword but Onward!

   If we would find God, we must destroy the remains of the old Adam
   within. The Lord held a little child in his arms, when He declared, "of
   such is the kingdom of Heaven." The sum of the principal directions is
   this: do not reason too much, always have an upright purpose in the
   smallest matters, and pay no attention to the thousand reflections by
   which we wrap and bury ourselves in self, under pretence of correcting
   our faults.
     __________________________________________________________________

  XXXI. ON THE EMPLOYMENT OF TIME.

   I understand perfectly well that you do not ask at my hands any proof
   that it is incumbent upon us to employ all our time to good purpose;
   grace has long since convinced you of this. It is a pleasant thing to
   come in contact with those who can meet us half way; but,
   notwithstanding this, much remains to be done, and there is a wonderful
   distance between the conviction of the intellect, even combined with
   the good intention of the heart, and a faithful and exact obedience.

   Nothing has been more common in ancient, as well as in modern times,
   then to meet souls who were perfect and holy, theoretically. (Matt.
   vii. 16,) "Ye shall know them by their fruits," says the Saviour. And
   this is the only rule that never deceives, when it is properly
   understood; it is that by which we must judge ourselves.

   There is a time for everything in our lives; but the maxim that governs
   every moment, is, that there should be none useless; that they should
   all enter into the order and sequence of our salvation; that they are
   all accompanied by duties which God has allotted with his own hand, and
   of which He will demand an account; for from the first instant of our
   existence to the last, He has never assigned us a barren moment, nor
   one which we can consider as given up to our own discretion. The great
   thing is to recognize his will in relation to them. This is to be
   effected, not by an eager and restless seeking, which is much more
   likely to spoil everything, than to enlighten us as to our duty, but by
   a true submission to those whom God has set over us, and a pure and
   upright heart which seeks God in its simplicity, and heartily opposes
   all the duplicity and false wisdom of self, as fast as it is revealed.
   For we misemploy our time, not only when we do wrong or do nothing, but
   also when we do something else than what was incumbent on us at the
   moment, even though it may be the means of good. We are strangely
   ingenious in perpetually seeking our own interest; and what the world
   does nakedly and without shame, those who desire to be devoted to God
   do also, but in a refined manner, under favor of some pretext which
   serves as a veil to hide from them the deformity of their conduct.

   The best general means to ensure the profitable employment of our time,
   is to accustom ourselves to living in continual dependence upon the
   Spirit of God and his law, receiving, every instant, whatever He is
   pleased to bestow; consulting Him in every emergency requiring instant
   action, and having recourse to Him in our weaker moments, when virtue
   seems to fail; invoking his aid, and rising our hearts to Him whenever
   we are solicited by sensible objects, and find ourselves surprised and
   estranged from God, and far from the true road.

   Happy is the soul that commits itself, by a sincere self-abandonment,
   into the hands of its Creator, ready to do all his will, and
   continually crying, "Lord, what wouldst Thou have me to do? Teach me to
   do thy will, for Thou art my God!" (Acts. ix. 6; Psalm cxliii. 10.)

   During our necessary occupations, we need only pay a simple attention
   to the leadings of Divine Providence. As they are all prepared for us,
   and presented by Him, our only care should be to receive them with a
   child-like spirit, and submit everything absolutely to Him; our temper,
   our own will, our scruples, our restlessness, our self-reflections, our
   overflowing emotions of hurry, vain joy, or other passions which
   assault us according as we are pleased or displeased with the different
   events of the day. Let us be careful, however, not to suffer ourselves
   to be overwhelmed by the multiplicity of our exterior occupations, be
   they what they may.

   Let us endeavor to commence every enterprise with a pure view to the
   glory of God, continue it without distraction, and finish it without
   impatience.

   The intervals of relaxation and amusement are the most dangerous
   seasons for us, and perhaps the most useful for others; we must, then,
   be on our guard, that we be as faithful as possible to the presence of
   God. We must make use of all that Christian vigilance so much
   recommended by our Lord; raise our hearts to God in the simple view of
   faith, and dwell in sweet and peaceful dependence upon the Spirit of
   grace, as the only means of our safety and strength. This is especially
   necessary for such as are looked up to as in authority, and whose words
   may be the cause of so much good or evil.

   Our leisure hours are ordinarily the sweetest and pleasantest for
   ourselves; we can never employ them better than in refreshing our
   spiritual strength, by a secret and intimate communion with God. Prayer
   is so necessary, and the source of so many blessings, that he who has
   discovered the treasure cannot be prevented from having recourse to it,
   whenever he has an opportunity.

   I could add much more concerning these matters, and I may perhaps do
   so, if my present views do not escape me; but, if they do, it is of
   little consequence. God gives others when He pleases; if He does not,
   it is a proof that they are not necessary; and if so, we should be well
   satisfied with their loss.

SPIRITUAL LETTERS.

  FENELON.

   "And I have declared unto them thy name and will declare it; that the
   love wherewith thou hast loved me, may be in them and I in them."--John
   xvii. 26.

SPIRITUAL LETTERS.
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER I. The advantage of humiliation.

   I pray often to God that He would keep you in the hollow of his hand.
   The most essential point is lowliness. It is profitable for all things,
   for it produces a teachable spirit which makes everything easy. You
   would be more guilty than many others if you made any resistance to God
   on this point. On the one hand, you have received abundant light and
   grace on the necessity of becoming like a little child; and on the
   other, no one has had an experience fitter to humiliate the heart and
   destroy self-confidence. The great profit to be derived from an
   experience of our weakness, is to render us lowly and obedient. May the
   Lord keep you!
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER II. How to bear suffering so as to preserve our peace.

   As to our friend, I pray God to bestow upon him a simplicity that shall
   give him peace. When we are faithful in instantly dropping all
   superfluous and restless reflections, which arise from a self-love as
   different as possible from charity, we shall be set in a large place
   even in the midst of the strait and narrow path. We shall be in the
   pure liberty and innocent peace of the children of God, without being
   found wanting either towards God or man.

   I apply to myself the same counsel that I give to others, and am well
   persuaded that I must seek my own peace in the same direction. My heart
   is now suffering; but it is the life of self that causes us pain; that
   which is dead does not suffer. If we were dead, and our life were hid
   with Christ in God, (Col. iii. 3,) we should no longer perceive those
   pains in spirit that now afflict us. We should not only bear bodily
   sufferings with equanimity, but spiritual affliction also, that is to
   say, trouble sent upon the soul without its own immediate act. But the
   disturbances of a restless activity, in which the soul adds to the
   cross imposed by the hand of God, the burden of an agitated resistance,
   and an unwillingness to suffer, are only experienced in consequence of
   the remaining life of self.

   A cross which comes purely from God, and is cordially welcomed without
   any self-reflective acts, is at once painful and peaceful; but one
   unwillingly received and repelled by the life of nature, is doubly
   severe; the resistance within is harder to bear than the cross itself.
   If we recognize the hand of God, and make no opposition in the will, we
   have comfort in our affliction. Happy indeed are they who can bear
   their sufferings in the enjoyment of this simple peace and perfect
   acquiescence in the will of God! Nothing so shortens and soothes our
   pains as this spirit of non-resistance.

   But we are generally desirous of bargaining with God; we would like at
   least to impose the limits and see the end of our sufferings. That same
   obstinate and hidden hold of life, which renders the cross necessary,
   causes us to reject it in part, and by a secret resistance, which
   impairs its virtue. We have thus to go over the same ground again and
   again; we suffer greatly, but to very little purpose. The Lord deliver
   us from falling into that state of soul in which crosses are of no
   benefit to us! God loves a cheerful giver, according to St. Paul (2
   Cor. ix. 7); ah! what must be his love to those who, in a cheerful and
   absolute abandonment, resign themselves to the entire extent of his
   crucifying will!
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER III. The beauty of the cross.

   I cannot but wonder at the virtue that lies in suffering; we are worth
   nothing without the cross. I tremble and am in an agony while it lasts,
   and all my conviction of its salutary effects vanish under the torture,
   but when it is over, I look back at it with admiration, and am ashamed
   that I bore it so ill. This experience of my folly is a deep lesson of
   wisdom to me.

   Whatever may be the state of your sick friend, and whatever the issue
   of her disease, she is blessed in being so quiet under the hand of God.
   If she die, she dies to the Lord; if she live, she lives to Him. Either
   the cross or death, says St. Theresa.

   Nothing is beyond the necessity of the cross but the established
   kingdom of God; when we bear it in love, it is his kingdom begun, with
   which we must remain satisfied while it is his pleasure. You have need
   of the cross as well as I. The faithful Giver of every good gift
   distributes them to each of us with his own hand, blessed be his name!
   Ah! how good it is to be chastened for our profit!
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER IV. The death of self.

   I cannot express to you, my dear sister, how deeply I sympathize with
   your afflictions; but my grief is not unmixed with consolation. God
   loves you, since He does not spare you, but lays upon you the cross of
   Jesus Christ. Whatever light, whatever feeling we may possess, is all a
   delusion, if it lead us not to the real and constant practice of dying
   to self. We cannot die without suffering, neither can we be said to be
   dead, while there is still any part in us which is alive. That death
   with which God blesses the soul, pierces even to the dividing asunder
   of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow. He who sees in us
   what we cannot see, knows full well where the blow should fall; He
   takes away that which we are most reluctant to give up. Pain is only
   felt where there is life, and where there is life, is just the place
   where death is needed. Our Father wastes no time by cutting into parts
   which are already dead; if He sought to continue life, He would do so,
   but He seeks to destroy, and this He can only accomplish by cutting
   into that which is quick and living. You need not expect Him to attack
   those gross and wicked desires which you renounced forever, when you
   gave yourself away to Him, but he will prove you, perhaps, by
   destroying your liberty of soul, and by depriving you of your most
   spiritual consolations.

   Would you resist? Ah! no! Suffer all things! This death must be
   voluntary, and can only be accomplished to that extent to which you are
   willing it should be. To resist death, and repel its advances, is not
   being willing to die. Give up voluntarily, then, to the good pleasure
   of God, all your reliances, even the most spiritual, whenever He may
   seem disposed to take them from you. What fearest thou, O thou of
   little faith? Dost thou fear that He may not be able to supply to thee
   from Himself, that succor which He takes away on the part of man? And
   why does He take it away, except to supply it from Himself, and to
   purify thee by the painful lesson? I see that every way is shut up, and
   that God means to accomplish his work in you, by cutting off every
   human resource. He is a jealous God; He is not willing you should owe
   what He is about to perform in you, to any other than to Himself alone.

   Give yourself up to his plans--be led whither He will by his
   providences. Beware how you seek aid from man, when God forbids
   it--they can only give you what He gives them for you. Why should you
   be troubled that you can no longer drink from the aqueduct when you are
   led to the perennial spring itself from which its waters are derived?
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER V. Peace lies in simplicity and obedience.

   Cultivate peace; be deaf to your too prolific imagination; its great
   activity not only injures the health of your body, but introduces
   aridity into your soul. You consume yourself to no purpose; peace and
   interior sweetness are destroyed by your restlessness. Think you God
   can speak in those soft and tender accents that melt the soul, in the
   midst of such a tumult as you excite by your incessant hurry of
   thought? Be quiet, and He will soon be heard. Indulge but a single
   scruple; to be scrupulously obedient.

   You ask for consolation; but you do not perceive that you have been led
   to the brink of the fountain, and refuse to drink. Peace and
   consolation are only to be found in simple obedience. Be faithful in
   obeying without reference to your scruples, and you will soon find that
   the rivers of living water will flow according to the promise. You will
   receive according to the measure of your faith; much, if you believe
   much; nothing, if you believe nothing and continue to give ear to your
   empty imaginations.

   You dishonor true love by the supposition that it is anxious about such
   trifles as continually occupy your attention; it goes straight to God
   in pure simplicity. Satan is transformed into an angel of light; he
   assumes the beautiful form of a scrupulous love and a tender
   conscience; but you should know by experience the trouble and danger
   into which he will lead you by vehement scruples. Everything depends
   upon your faithfulness in repelling his first advances.

   If you become ingenuous and simple in your desires, I think you will
   have been more pleasing to God than if you had suffered a hundred
   martyrdoms. Turn all your anxieties toward your delay in offering a
   sacrifice so right in the sight of God. Can true love hesitate when it
   is required to please its well-beloved?
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER VI. The true source of peace is in the surrender of the will.

   Remain in peace; the fervor of devotion does not depend upon yourself;
   all that lies in your power is the direction of your will. Give that up
   to God without reservation. The important question is not how much you
   enjoy religion, but whether you will whatever God wills. Humbly confess
   your faults; be detached from the world, and abandoned to God; love Him
   more than yourself, and his glory more than your life; the least you
   can do is to desire and ask for such a love. God will then love you and
   put his peace in your heart.
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER VII. True good is only reached by abandonment.

   Evil is changed into good when it is received in patience through the
   love of God; while good is changed into evil when we become attached to
   it through the love of self. True good lies only in detachment, and
   abandonment to God. You are now in the trial; put yourself confidently
   and without reserve into his hand. What would I not sacrifice to see
   you once more restored in body, but heartily sick of the love of the
   world! Attachment to ourselves is a thousand times more infectious than
   a contagious poison, for it contains the venom of self. I pray for you
   with all my heart.
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER VIII. Knowledge puffeth up; charity edifieth.

   I am happy to hear of your frame of mind, and to find you communicating
   in simplicity everything that takes place within you. Never hesitate to
   write me whatever you think God requires.

   It is not at all surprising that you have a sort of jealous ambition to
   advance in the spiritual life, and to be intimate with persons of
   distinction who are pious. Such things are by nature very flattering to
   our self-love, and it eagerly seeks them. But we should not strive to
   gratify such an ambition by making great progress in the religious
   life, and by cultivating the acquaintance of persons high in honor; our
   aim should be to die to the flattering delights of self-love, by
   becoming humble and in love with obscurity and contempt, and to have a
   single eye to God.

   We may hear about perfection without end, and become perfectly familiar
   with its language, and yet be as far from its attainment as ever. Our
   great aim should be, to be deaf to self, to hearken to God in silence,
   to renounce every vanity, and to devote ourselves to solid virtue. Let
   us speak but little and do much, without a thought as to whether we are
   observed or not.

   God will teach you more than the most experienced Christians, and
   better than all the books that the world has ever seen. And what is
   your object in such an eager chase after knowledge? Are you not aware
   that all we need is to be poor in spirit, and to know nothing but
   Christ and Him crucified? Knowledge puffeth up; it is only charity that
   can edify. (1 Cor. viii. 1.) Be content with charity, then, alone.
   What! is it possible that the love of God, and the abandonment of self
   for his sake, is only to be reached through the acquisition of so much
   knowledge? You have already more than you use, and need further
   illuminations much less than the practice of what you already know. O
   how deceived we are, when we suppose we are advancing, because our vain
   curiosity is gratified by the enlightenment of our intellect! Be
   humble, and expect not the gifts of God from man.
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER IX. We are not to choose the manner in which our blessings shall be
  bestowed.

   You know what God requires of you; will you refuse? You perceive that
   your resistance to the drawings of his grace, arises solely from
   self-love: will you suffer the refinements of pride, and the most
   ingenious inventions of self, to reject the mercies of God? You who
   have so many scruples in relation to the passing thought, which is
   involuntary and therefore innocent, who confess so many things that
   should rather be dismissed at once, have you no scruples about your
   long-continued resistance to the Holy Spirit, because He has not seen
   fit to confer the benefits you desire, by a channel which was
   flattering to your self-love?

   What matter if you received the gifts of grace as beggars receive
   bread? The gifts themselves would be neither less pure nor less
   precious. Your heart would only be the more worthy of God, if, by its
   humility and annihilation, it attracted the succor that He was disposed
   to send. Is this the way you put off self? Is this the view that pure
   faith takes of the instrument of God? Is it thus that you die to the
   life of self within? To what purpose are your readings about pure love,
   and your frequent devotions? How can you read what condemns the very
   depths of your soul? You are influenced not only be self-interest, but
   by the persuasions of pride, when you reject the gifts of God, because
   they do not come in a shape to suit your taste. How can you pray? What
   is the language of God in the depths of your soul? He asks nothing but
   death, and you desire nothing but life. How can you put up to Him a
   prayer for his grace, with a restriction that He shall only send it by
   a channel demanding no sacrifice on your part but ministering to the
   gratification of your carnal pride?
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER X. The discovery and death of self.

   Yes, I joyfully consent that you call me your father! I am so and will
   be always; there needs only on your part a full and confident
   persuasion of it, which will come when your heart is enlarged.
   Self-love now shuts it up. We are in a strait place, indeed, when we
   are enclosed in self, but when we emerge from that prison, and enter
   into the immensity of God and the liberty of his children, we are set
   at large.

   I am rejoiced to find that God has reduced you to a state of weakness.
   Your self-love can neither be convinced nor vanquished by any other
   means, ever finding secret resources and impenetrable retreats in your
   courage and ingenuity. It was hidden from your eyes, while it fed upon
   the subtle poison of an apparent generosity, by which you constantly
   sacrificed yourself for others. God has forced it to cry aloud, to come
   forth into open day, and display its excessive jealousy. O how painful,
   but how useful, are these seasons of weakness? While any self-love
   remains, we are afraid of its being revealed, but so long as the least
   symptom of it lurks in the most secret recesses of the heart, God
   pursues it, and by some infinitely merciful blow, forces it into the
   light. The poison then becomes the remedy; self-love, pushed to
   extremity, discovers itself in all its deformity by a transport of
   despair, and disgraces all the refinements, and dissipates the
   flattering illusions of a whole life. God sets before your eyes your
   idol, self. You behold it, and cannot turn your eyes away; and as you
   have no longer power over yourself, you cannot keep the sight from
   others.

   Thus to exhibit self-love without its mask is the most mortifying
   punishment that can be inflicted. We no longer behold it wise,
   discreet, polite, self-possessed, and courageous in sacrificing itself
   for others; it is no longer the self-love whose nourishment consisted
   in the belief that it had need of nothing, and the persuasion that its
   greatness and generosity deserved a different name. It is the
   selfishness of a silly child, screaming at the loss of an apple; but it
   is far more tormenting, for it also weeps from rage that it has wept;
   it cannot be still, and refuses all comfort, because its venomous
   character has been detected. It beholds itself foolish, rude, and
   impertinent, and is forced to look its own frightful countenance in the
   face. It says with Job: "For the thing which I greatly feared is come
   upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me." (Job iii.
   25.) For precisely that which it most fears is the most necessary means
   of its destruction.

   We have no need that God should attack in us what has neither life nor
   sensibility. It is the living only that must die, and all the rest is
   nought. This, then, is what you needed, to behold a self-love
   convinced, sensitive, gross, and palpable. And now all you have to do,
   is to be quietly willing to look at it as it is; the moment you can do
   this, it will have disappeared.

   You ask for a remedy, that you may get well. You do not need to be
   cured, but to be slain; seek not impatiently for a remedy, but let
   death come. Be careful, however, lest a certain courageous resolve to
   avail yourself of no remedy, be itself a remedy in disguise, and give
   aid and comfort to this cursed life. Seek no consolation for self-love,
   and do not conceal the disease. Reveal everything in simplicity and
   holiness, and then suffer yourself to die.

   But this is not to be accomplished by any exertion of strength.
   Weakness is become your only possession; all strength is out of place;
   it only serves to render the agony longer and more distressing. If you
   expire from exhaustion, you will die so much the quicker and less
   violently. A dying life must of necessity be painful. Cordials are a
   cruelty to the sufferer on the wheel; he only longs for the fatal blow,
   not food, nor sustenance. If it were possible to weaken him and hasten
   his death, we should abridge his sufferings; but we can do nothing; the
   hand alone that tied him to his torture can deliver him from the
   remains of suffering life.

   Ask, then, neither remedies, sustenance, nor death; to ask death, is
   impatience; to ask food or remedies, is to prolong our agony. What,
   then, shall we do? Let alone; seek nothing, hold to nothing; confess
   everything, not as a means of consolation, but through humility and
   desire to yield. Look to me, not as a source of life, but as a means of
   death. As an instrument of life would belie its purpose, if it did not
   minister to life, so an instrument of death would be falsely named, if,
   in lieu of slaying, it kept alive. Let me, then, be, or at least seem
   to you to be, hard, unfeeling, indifferent, pitiless, wearied, annoyed,
   and contemptuous. God knows how far it is from the truth; but he
   permits it all to appear; and I shall be much more serviceable to you
   in this false and imaginary character than by my affection and real
   assistance, for the point is not, how you are to be sustained and kept
   alive, but how you are to lose all and die.
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER XI. The sight of our imperfections should not take away our peace.

   There is something very hidden and very deceptive in your suffering;
   for while you seem to yourself to be wholly occupied with the glory of
   God, in your inmost soul it is self alone that occasions all your
   trouble. You are, indeed, desirous that God should be glorified, but
   that it should take place by means of your perfection, and you thus
   cherish the sentiments of self-love. It is simply a refined pretext for
   dwelling in self. If you would truly derive profit from the discovery
   of your imperfections, neither justify nor condemn on their account,
   but quietly lay them before God, conforming your will to his in all
   things that you cannot understand, and remaining at peace; for peace is
   the order of God for every condition whatever. There is, in fact, a
   peace of conscience which sinners themselves should enjoy when awakened
   to repentance. Their suffering should be peaceful and mingled with
   consolation. Remember the beautiful word which once delighted you, that
   the Lord was not in noise and confusion, but in the still, small voice.
   (1 Kings xix. 11.)

  LETTER XII. Living by the cross and by faith.

   Everything is a cross; I have no joy but bitterness; but the heaviest
   cross must be borne in peace. At times it can neither be borne nor
   dragged; we can only fall down beneath it, overwhelmed and exhausted. I
   pray that God may spare you as much as possible in apportioning your
   suffering; it is our daily bread; God alone knows how much we need; and
   we must live in faith upon the means of death, confident, though we see
   it not, that God, with secret compassion, proportions our trials to the
   unperceived succor that He administers within. This life of faith is
   the most penetrating of all deaths.
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER XIII. Despair at our imperfection is a greater obstacle than the
  imperfection itself.

   Be not concerned about your defects. Love without ceasing, and you
   shall be much forgiven, because you have loved much. (Luke vii. 47.) We
   are apt to seek the delights and selfish supports of love, rather than
   love itself. We deceive ourselves, even in supposing we are endeavoring
   to love, when we are only trying to see that we love. We are more
   occupied with the love, says St. Francis of Sales, than with the
   Well-beloved. If He were our only object, we should be all taken up
   with Him; but when we are employed in obtaining an assurance of his
   love, we are still in a measure busy with self. Our defects, regarded
   in peace and in the spirit of love, are instantly consumed by love
   itself; but considered in the light of self, they make us restless, and
   interrupt the presence of God and the exercise of perfect love. The
   chagrin we feel at our own defects, is ordinarily a greater fault than
   the original defect itself. You are wholly taken up with the less of
   the two faults, like a person whom I have just seen, who, after reading
   the life of one of the saints, was so enraged at his own comparative
   imperfection, that he entirely abandoned the idea of living a devoted
   life. I judge of your fidelity by your peace and liberty of soul; the
   more peaceful and enlarged your heart, the nearer you seem to be to
   God.
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER XIV. Pure faith sees God alone.

   Be not anxious about the future; it is opposed to grace. When God sends
   you consolation, regard Him only in it, enjoy it day by day as the
   Israelites received their manna, and do not endeavor to lay it up in
   store. There are two peculiarities of pure faith; it sees God alone
   under all the imperfect envelopes which conceal Him, [4] and it holds
   the soul incessantly in suspense. We are kept constantly in the air,
   without being suffered to touch a foot to solid ground. The comfort of
   the present instant will be wholly inappropriate to the next; we must
   let God act with the most perfect freedom, in whatever belongs to Him,
   and think only of being faithful in all that depends upon ourselves.
   This momentary dependence, this darkness and this peace of the soul,
   under the utter uncertainty of the future, is a true martyrdom, which
   take place silently and without any stir. It is death by a slow fire;
   and the end comes so imperceptibly and interiorly, that it is often
   almost as much hidden from the sufferer himself, as from those who are
   unacquainted with his state. When God removes his gifts from you, He
   knows how and when to replace them, either by others or by Himself. He
   can raise up children from the very stones.

   Eat then your daily bread without thought for the morrow; "sufficient
   unto the day is the evil thereof." (Matt. vi. 34.) To-morrow will take
   thought for the things of itself. He who feeds you to-day, is the same
   to whom you will look for food to-morrow; manna shall fall again from
   heaven in the midst of the desert, before the children of God shall
   want any good thing.

   [4] The man that looks on glass, On it may stay his eye; Or, if he
   pleaseth, through it pass, And then the heavens espy.--Herbert. Pure
   faith cannot see the neighbor that succeeds, as he blindly thinks, in
   injuring us, nor the disease that attacks our bodies; that would be to
   stay its eye upon the glass, in which it would see a thousand flaws and
   imperfections that would annoy it and destroy its peace; it looks right
   through and discovers God; and what He permits, it cannot but joyfully
   acquiesce in.--Editor.
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER XV. Our knowledge stands in the way of our becoming wise.

   Live in peace, my dear young lady, without any thought for the future;
   perhaps there will be none for you. You have no present, even, of your
   own, for you must only use it in accordance with the designs of God, to
   whom it truly belongs. Continue the good works that occupy you, since
   you have an attraction that way, and can readily accomplish them. Avoid
   distractions, and the consequences of your excessive vivacity, and,
   above all things, be faithful to the present moment, and you will
   receive all necessary grace.

   It is not enough to be detached from the world; we must become lowly
   also; in detachment, we renounce the things without, in lowliness, we
   abandon self. Every shadow of perceptible pride must be left behind,
   and the pride of wisdom and virtue is more dangerous than that of
   worldly fortune, as it has a show of right, and is more refined.

   We must be lowly-minded in all points, and appropriate nothing to
   ourselves, our virtue and courage least of all. You rest too much in
   your own courage, disinterestedness, and uprightness. The babe owns
   nothing; it treats a diamond and an apple alike. Be a babe; have
   nothing of your own; forget yourself; give way on all occasions; let
   the smallest be greater than you.

   Pray simply from the heart, from pure love, and not from the head, from
   the intellect alone.

   Your true instruction is to be found in spoliation, deep recollection,
   silence of the whole soul before God, in renouncing your own spirit,
   and, in the love of lowliness, obscurity, feebleness, and annihilation.
   This ignorance is the accomplished teacher of all truth; knowledge
   cannot attain to it, or can reach it but superficially.
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER XVI. Those who endeavor to injure us are to be loved and welcomed as
  the hand of God.

   I sympathize, as I ought, in all your troubles, but I can do nothing
   else except pray God that He would console you. You have great need of
   the gift of his Spirit to sustain you in your difficulties, and to
   restrain your natural vivacity under the trials which are so fitted to
   excite it. As to the letter touching your birth, I think you should lay
   it before God alone, and beg his mercy upon him who has sought to
   injure you.

   I have always perceived, or thought that I perceived, that you were
   sensitive on that point. God always attacks us on our weak side; we do
   not aim to kill a person by striking a blow at his insensible parts,
   such as the hair or nails, but by endeavoring to reach at once the
   noble organs, the immediate seats of life. When God would have us die
   to self, he always touches the tenderest spot, that which is fullest of
   life. It is thus that he distributes crosses. Suffer yourself to be
   humbled. Silence and peace under humiliation are the true good of the
   soul; we are tempted, under a thousand specious pretexts, to speak
   humbly; but it is far better to be humbly silent. The humility that can
   yet talk, has need of careful watching; self-love derives comfort from
   its outward words.

   Do not suffer yourself to get excited by what is said about you. Let
   the world talk; do you strive to do the will of God; as for that of
   men, you could never succeed in doing it to their satisfaction, and it
   is not worth the pains. A moment of silence, of peace, and of union to
   God, will amply recompense you for every calumny that shall be uttered
   against you. We must love our fellows, without expecting friendship
   from them; they leave us and return, they go and come; let them do as
   they will; it is but a feather, the sport of the wind. See God only in
   them; it is He that afflicts or consoles us, by means of them,
   according as we have need.
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER XVII. Quietness in God our true resource.

   Warmth of imagination, ardor of feeling, acuteness of reasoning, and
   fluency of expression, can do but little. The true agent is a perfect
   abandonment before God, in which we do everything by the light which He
   gives, and are content with the success which He bestows. This
   continual death is a blessed life known to few. A single word, uttered
   from this rest, will do more, even in outward affairs, than all our
   most eager and officious care. It is the Spirit of God that then speaks
   the word, and it loses none of its force and authority, but enlightens,
   persuades, moves, and edifies. We have accomplished everything, and
   have scarce said anything.

   On the other hand, if left to the excitability of our natural
   temperament, we talk forever, indulging in a thousand subtle and
   superfluous reflections; we are constantly afraid of not saying or
   doing enough; we get angry, excited, exhausted, distracted, and finally
   make no headway. Your disposition has an especial need of these maxims;
   they are as necessary for your body as your soul, and your physician,
   and your spiritual adviser should act together.

   Let the water flow beneath the bridge; let men be men, that is to say,
   weak, vain, inconstant, unjust, false, and presumptuous; let the world
   be the world still; you cannot prevent it. Let every one follow his own
   inclination and habits; you cannot recast them, and the best course is,
   to let them be as they are and bear with them. Do not think it strange
   when you witness unreasonableness and injustice; rest in peace in the
   bosom of God; He sees it all more clearly than you do, and yet permits
   it. Be content to do quietly and gently what it becomes you to do, and
   let everything else be to you as though it were not.
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER XVIII. True friendships are founded only in God.

   We must be content with what God gives, without having any choice of
   our own. It is right that his will should be done, not ours; and that
   his should become ours without the least reservation, in order that it
   may be done on earth as it is done in heaven. This is a hundred times
   more valuable an attainment than to be engaged in the view or
   consolation of self.

   O how near are we to each other when we are all united in God! How well
   do we converse when we have but a single will and a single thought in
   Him who is all things in us! Would you find your true friends, then?
   Seek them only in Him who is the single source of true and eternal
   friendship. Would you speak with or hear from them? Sink in silence
   into the bosom of Him who is the word, the life, and the soul of all
   those who speak and live the truth. You will find in Him not only every
   want supplied, but everything perfect, which you find so imperfect in
   the creatures in whom you confide.
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER XIX. The cross a source of our pleasure.

   I sympathize with all your distresses; but we must carry the cross with
   Christ in this transitory life. We shall soon have no time to suffer;
   we shall reign with God our consolation, who will have wiped away our
   tears with his own hand, and from before whose presence pain and
   sighing shall forever flee away. While this fleeting moment of trial is
   permitted us, let us not lose the slightest portion of the worth of the
   cross. Let us suffer in humility and in peace; our self-love
   exaggerates our distresses, and magnifies them in our imagination. A
   cross borne in simplicity, without the interference of self-love to
   augment it, is only half a cross. Suffering in this simplicity of love,
   we are not only happy in spite of the cross, but because of it; for
   love is pleased in suffering for the Well-beloved, and the cross which
   forms us into his image is a consoling bond of love.
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER XX. The absence of feeling and the revelation of self no sufficient
  causes of distress.

   I pray God that this new year may be full of grace and blessing to you.
   I am not surprised that you do not enjoy recollection as you did on
   being delivered from a long and painful agitation. Everything is liable
   to be exhausted. A lively disposition, accustomed to active exertion,
   soon languishes in solitude and inaction. For a great number of years
   you have been necessarily much distracted by external activity, and it
   was this circumstance that made me fear the effect of the life of
   abandonment upon you. You were at first in the fervor of your
   beginnings, when no difficulties appear formidable. You said with
   Peter, it is good for us to be here; but it is often with us as it was
   with him, that we know not what we say. (Mark ix. 56.) In our moments
   of enjoyment, we feel as if we could do everything; in the time of
   temptation and discouragement, we think we can do nothing, and believe
   that all is lost. But we are alike deceived in both.

   You should not be disturbed at any distraction that you may experience;
   the cause of it lay concealed within even when you felt such zeal for
   recollection. Your temperament and habits all conduce to making you
   active and eager. It was only weariness and exhaustion that caused you
   to relish an opposite life. But, by fidelity to grace, you will
   gradually become permanently introduced into the experience of which
   you have had a momentary taste. God bestowed it that you might see
   whither He would lead you; He then takes it away, that we may be made
   sensible that it does not belong to us; that we are neither able to
   procure nor preserve it, and that it is a gift of grace that must be
   asked in all humility.

   Be not amazed at finding yourself sensitive, impatient, haughty,
   self-willed; you must be made to perceive that such is your natural
   disposition. We must bear the yoke of the daily confusion of our sins,
   says St. Augustine. We must be made to feel our weakness, our
   wretchedness, our inability to correct ourselves. We must despair of
   our own heart, and have no hope but in God. We must bear with
   ourselves, without flattering, and without neglecting a single effort
   for our correction.

   We must be instructed as to our true character, while waiting for God's
   time to take it away. Let us become lowly under his all-powerful hand;
   yielding and manageable as often as we perceive any resistance in our
   will. Be silent as much as you can. Be in no haste to judge; suspend
   your decisions, your likes and dislikes. Stop at once when you become
   aware that your activity is hurried, and do not be too eager even for
   good things.
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER XXI. The imperfection of others to be borne in love.

   It is a long while since I renewed the assurance of my attachment to
   you in our Lord. It is, nevertheless, greater than ever. I desire with
   all my heart that you may always find in your household the peace and
   consolation which you enjoyed in the beginning. To be content with even
   the best of people, we must be contented with little and bear a great
   deal. Those who are most perfect, have many imperfections, and we have
   great faults, so that between the two, mutual toleration becomes very
   difficult. We must bear one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of
   Christ, (Gal. vi. 2,) thus setting off one against the other in love.
   Peace and unanimity will be much aided by frequent silence, habitual
   recollection, prayer, self-abandonment, renunciation of all vain
   criticisms, and a faithful departure from the vain reflections of a
   jealous and difficult self-love. To how much trouble would this
   simplicity put an end! Happy he who neither listens to self nor to the
   tales of others!

   Be content with leading a simple life, according to your condition. Be
   obedient, and bear your daily cross; you need it, and it is bestowed by
   the pure mercy of God. The grand point is to despise self from the
   heart, and to be willing to be despised, if God permits it. Feed upon
   Him alone; St. Augustine says that his mother lived upon prayer; do you
   do so likewise, and die to everything else. We can only live to God by
   the continual death of self.
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER XXII. The fear of death not taken away by our own courage, but by the
  grace of God.

   I am not in the least surprised to learn that your impression of death
   becomes more lively, in proportion as age and infirmity bring it
   nearer. I experience the same thing. There is an age at which death is
   forced upon our consideration more frequently, by more irresistible
   reflections, and by a time of retirement in which we have fewer
   distractions. God makes use of this rough trial to undeceive us in
   respect to our courage, to make us feel our weakness, and to keep us in
   all humility in his own hands.

   Nothing is more humiliating than a troubled imagination, in which we
   search in vain for our former confidence in God. This is the crucible
   of humiliation, in which the heart is purified by a sense of its
   weakness and unworthiness. In his sight shall no man living be
   justified (Psalm cxliii. 2); yea, the heavens are not clean in his
   sight, (Job xv. 15,) and in many things we offend all. (James iii. 2.)
   We behold our faults and not our virtues; which latter it would be even
   dangerous to behold, if they are real.

   We must go straight on through this deprivation without interruption,
   just as we were endeavoring to walk in the way of God, before being
   disturbed. If we should perceive any fault that needs correction, we
   must be faithful to the light given us, but do it carefully, lest we be
   led into false scruples. We must then remain at peace, not listening to
   the voice of self-love, mourning over our approaching death, but detach
   ourselves from life, offering it in sacrifice to God, and confidently
   abandon ourselves to Him. St. Ambrose was asked, when dying, whether he
   was not afraid of the judgments of God; "We have a good master," said
   he, and so must we reply to ourselves. We need to die in the most
   impenetrable uncertainty, not only as to God's judgment upon us, but as
   to our own characters. We must, as St. Augustine has it, be so reduced
   as to have nothing to present before God but our wretchedness and his
   mercy. Our wretchedness is the proper object of his mercy, and his
   mercy is all our merit. In your hours of sadness, read whatever will
   strengthen your confidence and establish your heart. "Truly God is good
   to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart." (Psalm lxxiii. 1.)
   Pray for this cleanness of heart, which is so pleasing in his sight,
   and which renders Him so compassionate to our failings.
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER XXIII. Sensitiveness under reproof the surest sign we needed it.

   I greatly desire that you may have interior peace. You know that it
   cannot be found, except in lowliness of mind, and lowliness is not
   real, except it be produced by God upon every proper occasion. These
   occasions are chiefly when we are blamed by someone who disapproves of
   us, and when we experience inward weakness. We must accustom ourselves
   to bearing both these trials.

   We are truly lowly when we are no longer taken by surprise at finding
   ourselves corrected from without and incorrigible within. We are then
   like little children, below everything, and are willing to be so; we
   feel that our reprovers are right, but that we are unable to overcome
   ourselves, in order to correct our faults. Then we despair of
   ourselves, and expect nothing except from God; the reproofs of others,
   harsh and unfeeling as they may be, seem to us less than we deserve; if
   we cannot bear them, we condemn our sensitiveness more than all our
   other imperfections. Correction cannot then make us more humble than it
   finds us. The interior rebellion, far from hindering the profit of the
   correction, convinces us of its absolute necessity; in truth, the
   reproof would not have been felt, if it had not cut into some living
   part; had death been there, we should not have perceived it; and thus
   the more acutely we feel, the more certainly we know that the
   correction was necessary.

   I beg your forgiveness if I have said anything too harsh; but do not
   doubt my affection for you, and count as nothing everything that comes
   from me. See only the hand of God, which makes use of the awkwardness
   of mine, to deal you a painful blow. The pain proves that I have
   touched a sore spot. Yield to God, acquiesce in all his dealings, and
   you will soon be at rest and in harmony within. You know well enough
   how to give this advice to others; the occasion is important, critical.
   O what grace will descend upon you, if you will bear, like a little
   child, all the means God employs to humiliate and dispossess you of
   your senses and will! I pray that he may so diminish you that you can
   no longer be found at all.
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER XXIV. Imperfection only is intolerant of imperfection.

   It has seemed to me that you have need of more enlargedness of heart in
   relation to the defects of others. I know that you cannot help seeing
   them when they come before you, nor prevent the opinions you
   involuntarily form concerning the motives of some of those about you.
   You cannot even get rid of a certain degree of trouble which these
   things cause you. It will be enough if you are willing to bear with
   those defects which are unmistakable, refrain from condemning those
   which are doubtful, and not suffer yourself to be so afflicted by them
   as to cause a coolness of feeling between you.

   Perfection is easily tolerant of the imperfections of others; it
   becomes all things to all men. We must not be surprised at the greatest
   defects in good souls, and must quietly let them alone until God gives
   the signal of gradual removal; otherwise we shall pull up the wheat
   with the tares. God leaves, in the most advanced souls, certain
   weaknesses entirely disproportioned to their eminent state. As workmen,
   in excavating the soil from a field, leave certain pillars of earth
   which indicate the original level of the surface, and serve to measure
   the amount of material removed--God, in the same way, leaves pillars of
   testimony to the extent of his work in the most pious souls.

   Such persons must labor, each one in his degree, for his own
   correction, and you must labor to bear with their weaknesses. You know
   from experience the bitterness of the work of correction; strive then
   to find means to make it less bitter to others. You have not an eager
   zeal to correct, but a sensitiveness that easily shuts up your heart.

   I pray you more than ever not to spare my faults. If you should think
   you see one, which is not really there, there is no harm done; if I
   find that your counsel wounds me, my sensitiveness demonstrates that
   you have discovered a sore spot; but if not, you will have done me an
   excellent kindness in exercising my humility, and accustoming me to
   reproof. I ought to be more lowly than others in proportion as I am
   higher in position, and God demands of me a more absolute death to
   everything. I need this simplicity, and I trust it will be the means of
   cementing rather than of weakening our attachment.
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER XXV. We should listen to God and not to self-love.

   I beseech you not to listen to self. Self-love whispers in one ear and
   the love of God in the other; the first is restless, bold, eager, and
   impetuous; the other is simple, peaceful, and speaks but a few words in
   a mild and gentle voice. The moment we attend to the voice of self
   crying in our ear, we can no longer hear the modest tones of holy love.
   Each speaks only of its single object. Self-love entertains us with
   self, which, according to it, is never sufficiently well attended to;
   it talks of friendship, regard, esteem, and is in despair at everything
   but flattery. The love of God, on the other hand, desires that self
   should be forgotten, that it should be trodden under foot and broken as
   an idol, and that God should become the self of espoused souls, and
   occupy them as others are occupied by self. Let the vain, complaining
   babbler, self-love, be silenced, that in the stillness of the heart we
   may listen to that other love that only speaks when addressed.
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER XXVI. Absolute trust the shortest road to God.

   I have no doubt but that God constantly treats you as one of his
   friends, that is, with crosses, sufferings, and humiliations. The ways
   and means of God to draw souls to Himself, accomplish his design much
   more rapidly and effectually than all the efforts of the creature; for
   they destroy self-love at its very root, where, with all our pains, we
   could scarce discover it. God knows all its windings, and attacks it in
   its strongest holds.

   If we had strength and faith enough to trust ourselves entirely to God,
   and follow Him simply wherever He should lead us, we should have no
   need of any great effort of mind to reach perfection. But as we are so
   weak in faith, as to require to know all the way without trusting in
   God, our road is lengthened and our spiritual affairs get behind.
   Abandon yourself as absolutely as possible to God, and continue to do
   so to your latest breath, and He will never desert you.
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER XXVII. The time of temptation and distress is no time to form resolves.

   Your excessive distress is like a summer torrent, which must be
   suffered to run away. Nothing makes any impression upon you, and you
   think you have the most substantial evidence for the most imaginary
   states; it is the ordinary result of great suffering. God permits you,
   notwithstanding your excellent faculties, to be blind to what lies
   immediately before you, and to think you see clearly what does not
   exist at all. God will be glorified in your heart, if you will be
   faithful in yielding to his designs. But nothing would be more
   injudicious than the forming of resolutions in a state of distress,
   which is manifestly accompanied by an inability to do anything
   according to God.

   When you shall have become calm, then do in a spirit of recollection,
   what you shall perceive to be nearest the will of God respecting you.
   Return gradually to devotion, simplicity, and the oblivion of self.
   Commune and listen to God, and be deaf to self. Then do all that is in
   your heart, for I have no fear that a spirit of that sort will permit
   you to take any wrong step. But to suppose that we are sane when we are
   in the very agony of distress, and under the influence of a violent
   temptation of self-love, is to ensure our being led astray. Ask any
   experienced adviser, and he will tell you that you are to make no
   resolutions until you have re-entered into peace and recollection. You
   will learn from him that the readiest way to self-deception is, to
   trust to ourselves in a state of suffering, in which nature is so
   unreasonable and irritated.

   You will say that I desire to prevent you doing as you ought, if I
   forbid your doing it at the only moment when you are capable of it. God
   forbid! I neither desire to permit nor hinder: my only wish is so to
   advise you that you shall not be found wanting toward God. Now it is as
   clear as day, that you would fall in that respect, if you took counsel
   at the hands of a self-love wounded to the quick, and an irritation
   verging upon despair. Would you change anything to gratify your
   self-love, when God does not desire it? God forbid! Wait, then, until
   you shall be in a condition to be advised. To enjoy the true advantages
   of illumination, we must be equally ready for every alternative, and
   must have nothing which we are not cheerfully disposed at once to
   sacrifice for His sake.
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER XXVIII. Who has love, has all.

   I have thought frequently, since yesterday, on the matters you
   communicated to me, and I have increasing confidence that God will
   sustain you. Though you take no great pleasure in religious exercises,
   you must not neglect to be faithful in them, as far as your health will
   permit. A convalescent has but little appetite, but he must eat to
   sustain life.

   It would be very serviceable to you, if you could occasionally have a
   few minutes of Christian converse with such of your family as you can
   confide in, and, as to the choice, be guided in perfect liberty by your
   impressions at the moment. God does not call you by any lively
   emotions, and I heartily rejoice at it, if you will but remain
   faithful; for a fidelity, unsustained by delights, is far purer, and
   safer from danger, than one accompanied by those tender feelings, which
   may be seated too exclusively in the imagination. A little reading and
   recollection every day, will be the means of insensibly giving you
   light and strength for all the sacrifices God will require of you. Love
   Him, and I will acquit you of everything else; for everything else will
   come by love. I do not ask from you a love tender and emotional, but
   only that your will should lean towards love, and that, notwithstanding
   all the corrupt desires of your heart, you should prefer God before
   self and the whole world.

  LETTER XXIX. Weakness preferable to strength, and practice better than
  knowledge.

   I am told, my dear child in our Lord, that you are suffering from
   sickness. I suffer with you, for I love you dearly; but I cannot but
   kiss the hand that smites you, and I pray you to kiss it lovingly with
   me. You have heretofore abused your health and the pleasures derived
   from it; this weakness and its attendant pains are the natural
   consequence of such a course.

   I pray God only that He may depress your spirit even more than your
   body, and while He comforts the latter according to your need, that He
   may entirely vanquish the former. O how strong we are when we begin to
   perceive that we are but weakness and infirmity! Then we are ever ready
   to believe that we are mistaken, and to correct ourselves while
   confessing it; our minds are ever open to the illumination of others;
   then we are authoritative in nothing, and say the most decided things
   with simplicity and deference for others; then we do not object to be
   judged, and submit without hesitation to the censure of the first
   comer. At the same time, we judge no one without absolute necessity; we
   speak only to those who desire it, mentioning the imperfections we seem
   to have discovered, without dogmatism, and rather to gratify their
   wishes than from a desire to be believed or create a reputation for
   wisdom.

   I pray God that He may keep you faithful to his grace, and that He who
   hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus
   Christ. (Phil. i. 6.) We must bear with ourselves with patience and
   without flattery, and remain in unceasing subjection to every means of
   overcoming our thoughts and inward repugnances; we shall thus become
   more pliable to the impressions of grace in the practice of the gospel.
   But let this work be done quietly and peacefully, and let it not be
   entered upon too eagerly, as though it could all be accomplished in a
   single day. Let us reason little, but do much. If we are not careful,
   the acquisition of knowledge will so occupy this life that we shall
   need another to reduce our acquirements into practice. We are in danger
   of believing ourselves advanced towards perfection in proportion to our
   knowledge [5] of the way; but all our beautiful theories, far from
   assisting in the death of self, only serve to nourish the life of Adam
   in us by a secret delight and confidence in our illumination. Be quit
   then of all trust in your own power and in your own knowledge of the
   way, and you will make a great stride towards perfection. Humility and
   self-distrust, with a frank ingenuousness, are fundamental virtues for
   you.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [5] This seems one of the most common as well as most serious mistakes
   to which spiritual persons are liable. God gives the knowledge and
   desires us to put it in practice; but the moment we see it, we are so
   carried away with delight, that we forget that there is anything else
   to be done; whereas we have comparatively slender reason to rejoice
   until it is put in vital operation in the life. Ye see, says the
   Saviour, but do not perceive; ye hear, but do not understand. Food,
   lying undigested in the stomach, is not only of no service to the body,
   but, if not removed, will become a serious injury; it is only when it
   is assimilated and mingled with the blood, and when it appears by its
   good effects in our hands, feet, head, and trunk, that it can be said
   to have become our own. To have a divine truth in the intellect, is
   indeed matter of thanksgiving; but it will avail only to our
   condemnation, if it be not also loved in the heart and acted in the
   life. Let us remember that it is not the knowledge of the way that God
   desires in us, but the practice of it; not light, but love. For though
   I understand all mysteries and all knowledge--and have not charity--I
   am nothing. (1 Cor. xiii. 2.)--Editor.
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER XXX. Beware of the pride of reasoning; the true guide to knowledge is
  love.

   Your mind is too much occupied with exterior things, and still worse,
   with argumentation, to be able to act with a frequent thought of God. I
   am always afraid of your excessive inclination to reason; it is a
   hinderance to that recollection and silence in which He reveals
   Himself. Be humble, simple, and sincerely abstracted with men; be
   recollected, calm, and devoid of reasonings before God. The persons who
   have heretofore had most influence with you, have been infinitely dry,
   reasoning, critical, and opposed to a true interior life. However
   little you might listen to them, you would hear only endless reasonings
   and a dangerous curiosity, which would insensibly draw you out of Grace
   and plunge you into the depths of Nature. Habits of long standing are
   easily revived; and the changes which cause us to revert to our
   original position are less easily perceived, because they are natural
   to our constitution. Distrust them, then; and beware of beginnings
   which, in fact, include the end.

   It is now four months since I have had any leisure for study; but I am
   very happy to forego study, and not to cling to anything, when
   providence would take it away. It may be that during the coming winter
   I shall have leisure for my library, but I shall enter it then, keeping
   one foot on the threshold, ready to leave it at the slightest
   intimation. The mind must keep fasts as well as the body. I have no
   desire to write, or speak, or to be spoken about, or to reason, or to
   persuade any. I live every day aridly enough, and with certain exterior
   inconveniences which beset me; but I amuse myself whenever I have an
   opportunity, if I need recreation. Those who make almanacs upon me, and
   are afraid of me, are sadly deceived. God bless them! I am far from
   being so foolish as to incommode myself for the sake of annoying them.
   I would say to them as Abraham said to Lot: Is not the whole land
   before thee? If you go to the east, I will go to the west. (Gen. xiii.
   9.)

   Happy he who is indeed free! The Son of God alone can make us free; but
   He can only do it by snapping every bond; and how is this to be done?
   By that sword which divides husband and wife, father and son, brother
   and sister. The world is then no longer of any account; but, as long as
   it is anything to us, so long our freedom is but a word, and we are as
   easily captured as a bird whose leg is fastened by a thread. He seems
   to be free; the string is not visible; but he can only fly its length,
   and he is a prisoner. You see the moral. What I would have you possess
   is more valuable than all you are fearful of losing. Be faithful in
   what you know, that you may be entrusted with more. Distrust your
   intellect, which has so often misled you. My own has been such a
   deceiver, that I no longer count upon it. Be simple, and firm in your
   simplicity. "The fashion of this world passeth away." (1 Cor. vii. 31.)
   We shall vanish with it, if we make ourselves like it by reason of
   vanity; but the truth of God remains forever, and we shall dwell with
   it if it alone occupies our attention.

   Again I warn you, beware of philosophers and great reasoners. They will
   always be a snare to you, and will do you more harm than you will know
   how to do them good. They linger and pine away in discussing exterior
   trifles, and never reach the knowledge of the truth. Their curiosity is
   an insatiable spiritual avarice. They are like those conquerors who
   ravage the world without possessing it. Solomon, after a deep
   experience of it, testifies to the vanity of their researches.

   We should never study but on an express intimation of Providence; and
   we should do it as we go to market, to buy the provision necessary for
   each day's wants. Then, too, we must study in the spirit of prayer. God
   is, at the same time, the Truth and the Love. We can only know the
   truth in proportion as we love--when we love it, we understand it well.
   If we do not love Love, we do not know Love. He who loves much, and
   remains humble and lowly in his ignorance, is the well-beloved one of
   the Truth; he knows what philosophers not only are ignorant of, but do
   not desire to know. Would that you might obtain that knowledge which is
   reserved for babes and the simple-minded, while it is hid from the wise
   and prudent. (Matt. xi. 25.)
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER XXXI. The gifts of God not to be rejected on account of the channel
  that brings them.

   I am glad you find in the person of whom you speak, the qualities you
   were in search of. God puts what He pleases where He pleases. Naaman
   could not be healed by all the waters of Syria, but must apply to those
   of Palestine. What does it matter from what quarter our light and help
   come? The source is the important point, not the conduit; that is the
   best channel which most exercises our faith, puts to shame our human
   wisdom, makes us simple and humble, and undeceives us in respect to our
   own power. Receive, then, whatever He bestows, in dependence upon the
   Spirit that bloweth where it listeth. We know not whence it cometh nor
   whither it goeth. (John iii. 8.) But we need not seek to know the
   secrets of God; let us only be obedient to what He reveals.

   Too much reasoning is a great distraction. Those who reason--the
   indevout wise--quench the inward spirit as the wind extinguishes a
   candle. After being with them for awhile, we perceive our hearts dry,
   and our mind off its centre. Shun intercourse with such men; they are
   full of danger to you.

   There are some who appear recollected, but whose appearance deceives
   us. It is easy to mistake a certain warmth of the imagination for
   recollection. Such persons are eager in the pursuit of some outward
   good, to which they are attached; they are distracted by this anxious
   desire; they are perpetually occupied in discussions and reasonings,
   but know nothing of that inward peace and silence, that listens to God.
   They are more dangerous than others, because their distraction is more
   disguised. Search their depths, and you will find them restless,
   fault-finding, eager, constantly occupied without, harsh and crude in
   all their desires, sensitive, full of their own thoughts, and impatient
   of the slightest contradiction; in a word, spiritual busy-bodies,
   annoyed at everything, and almost always annoying.
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER XXXII. Poverty and spoliation the way of Christ.

   Everything contributes to prove you; but God who loves you, will not
   suffer your temptations to exceed your strength. He will make use of
   the trial for your advancement. But we must not look inwards with
   curiosity to behold our progress, our strength, or the hand of God,
   which is not the less efficient because it is invisible. Its principal
   operations are conducted in secrecy, for we should never die to self,
   if He always visibly stretched out his hand to save us. God would then
   sanctify us in light, life, and the possession of every spiritual
   grace; but not upon the cross, in darkness, privation, nakedness and
   death. The directions of Christ are not, if any one will come after me,
   let him enjoy himself, let him be gorgeously apparelled, let him be
   intoxicated with delight, as was Peter on the mount, let him be glad in
   his perfection in me and in himself, let him behold himself, and be
   assured that he is perfect; on the contrary, his words are; If any one
   will come after me, I will show him the road he must take; let him deny
   himself, take up his cross and follow me in a path beside precipices,
   where he will see nothing but death on every hand. (Matt. xvi. 24.) St.
   Paul declares that we desire to be clothed upon, and that it is
   necessary, on the contrary, to be stripped to very nakedness, that we
   may then put on Christ.

   Suffer Him, then, to despoil self-love of every adornment, even to the
   inmost covering under which it lurks, that you may receive the robe
   whitened by the blood of the Lamb, and having no other purity than his.
   O happy soul, that no longer possesses anything of its own, nor even
   anything borrowed, and that abandons itself to the Well-beloved, being
   jealous of every beauty but his? O spouse, how beautiful art thou, when
   thou hast no longer anything of thing own! Thou shalt be altogether the
   delight of the bridegroom, when He shall be all thy comeliness! Then He
   will love thee without measure, because it will be Himself that He
   loves in thee.

   Hear these things and believe them. This pure truth shall be bitter in
   your mouth and belly, but it shall feed your heart upon that death
   which is the only true life. Give faith to this, and listen not to
   self; it is the grand seducer, more powerful than the serpent that
   deceived our mother. Happy the soul that hearkens in all simplicity to
   the voice that forbids its hearing or compassionating self!
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER XXXIII. The will of God our only treasure.

   I desire that you may have that absolute simplicity of abandonment that
   never measures its own extent, nor excepts anything in the present
   life, no matter how dear to our self-love. All illusions come, not from
   such an abandonment as this, but from one attended by secret
   reservations.

   Be as lowly and simple in the midst of the most exacting society as in
   your own closet. Do nothing from the reasonings of wisdom, nor from
   natural pleasure, but all from submission to the Spirit of life and
   death; death to self, and life in God. Let there be no enthusiasm, no
   search after certainty within, no looking forwards for better things,
   as if the present, bitter as it is, were not sufficient to those whose
   sole treasure is the will of God, and as if you would indemnify
   self-love for the sadness of the present by the prospects of the
   future! We deserve to meet with disappointment when we seek such vain
   consolation. Let us receive everything in lowliness of spirit, seeking
   nothing from curiosity, and withholding nothing from a disguised
   selfishness. Let God work, and think only of dying to the present
   moment without reservation, as though it were the whole of eternity.
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER XXXIV. Abandonment not a heroic sacrifice, but a simple sinking into
  the will of God.

   Your sole task, my dear daughter, is, to bear your infirmities both of
   body and mind. When I am weak, says the Apostle, then am I strong;
   strength is made perfect in weakness. We are only strong in God in
   proportion as we are weak in ourselves; your feebleness will be your
   strength if you accept it in all lowliness.

   We are tempted to believe that weakness and lowliness are incompatible
   with abandonment, because this latter is represented as a generous act
   of the soul by which it testifies its great love, and makes the most
   heroic sacrifices. But a true abandonment does not at all correspond to
   this flattering description; it is a simple resting in the love of God,
   as an infant lies in its mother's arms. A perfect abandonment must even
   go so far as to abandon its abandonment. We renounce ourselves without
   knowing it; if we knew it, it would no longer be complete, for there
   can be no greater support than a consciousness that we are wholly given
   up.

   Abandonment consist, not in doing great things for self to take delight
   in, but simply in suffering our weakness and infirmity, in letting
   everything alone. It is peaceful, for it would no longer be sincere, if
   we were still restless about anything we had renounced. It is thus that
   abandonment is the source of true peace; if we have not peace, it is
   because our abandonment is exceedingly imperfect.
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER XXXV. Daily dying takes the place of final death.

   We must bear our crosses; self is the greatest of them; we are not
   entirely rid of it until we can tolerate ourselves as simply and
   patiently as we do our neighbor. If we die in part every day of our
   lives, we shall have but little to do on the last. What we so much
   dread in the future will cause us no fear when it comes, if we do not
   suffer its terrors to be exaggerated by the restless anxieties of
   self-love. Bear with yourself, and consent in all lowliness to be
   supported by your neighbor. O how utterly will these little daily
   deaths destroy the power of the final dying!
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER XXXVI. Suffering belongs to the living, not the dead.

   Many are deceived when they suppose that the death of self is the cause
   of all the agony they feel, but their suffering is only caused by the
   remains of life. Pain is seated in the living, not the dead parts; the
   more suddenly and completely we expire, the less pain do we experience.
   Death is only painful to him who resist it; the imagination exaggerates
   its terrors; the spirit argues endlessly to show the propriety of the
   life of self; self-love fights against death, like a sick man in the
   last struggle. But we must die inwardly as well as outwardly; the
   sentence of death has gone forth against the spirit as well as against
   the body. Our great care should be that the spirit die first, and then
   our bodily death will be but a falling asleep. Happy they who sleep
   this sleep of peace!
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER XXXVII. The limits of our grace are those of our temptation.

   I sympathize sincerely with the sufferings of your dear sick one, and
   with the pain of those whom God has placed about her to help her bear
   the cross. Let her not distrust God, and He will proportion her
   suffering to the patience which He will bestow. No one can do this but
   He who made all hearts, and whose office it is to renew them by his
   grace. The man in whom He operates, knows nothing of the proper
   proportions; and, seeing the extent, neither of his future trials, nor
   of the grace prepared to meet them, he is tempted to discouragement and
   despair. Like a man who had never seen the ocean, he stands, at the
   coming in of the tide, between the water and an impassable wall of
   rock, and thinks he perceives the terrible certainty that the
   approaching waves must surely engulf him; he does not see that he
   stands within the point, at which God, with unerring finger, has drawn
   their boundry-line, and beyond which they shall not pass.

   God proves the righteous as with the ocean; he stirs it up, and makes
   its great billows seem to threaten our destruction, but He is always at
   hand to say, thus far shalt thou go and no farther. "God is faithful,
   who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able." (1 Cor.
   x. 13.)
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER XXXVIII. Resisting God, an effectual bar to grace.

   You perceive, by the light of God, in the depth of your conscience,
   what grace demands of you, but you resist Him. Hence your distress. You
   begin to say within, it is impossible for me to undertake to do what is
   required of me; this is a temptation to despair. Despair as much as you
   please of self, but never of God; He is all good and all powerful, and
   will grant you according to your faith. If you will believe all things,
   all things shall be yours, and you shall remove mountains. If you
   believe nothing, you shall have nothing, but you alone will be to
   blame. Look at Mary, who, when the most incredible thing in the world
   was proposed to her, did not hesitate, but exclaimed; "be it unto me
   according to thy word." (Luke i. 38.)

   Open, then your heart. It is now so shut up, that you not only have not
   the power to do what is required of you, but you do not even desire to
   have it; you have no wish that your heart should be enlarged, and you
   fear that it will be. How can grace find room in so straitened a heart?
   All that I ask of you is, that you will rest in a teachable spirit of
   faith, and that you will not listen to self. Simply acquiesce in
   everything with lowliness of mind, and receive peace through
   recollection, and everything will be gradually accomplished for you;
   those things which, in your hour of temptation, seemed the greatest
   difficulties, will be insensibly smoothed away.
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER XXXIX. God speaks more effectually in the soul, than to it.

   Nothing gives me more satisfaction than to see you simple and peaceful.
   Simplicity brings back the state of Paradise. We have no great
   pleasures, and suffer some pain; but we have no desire for the former,
   and we receive the latter with thanksgiving. This interior harmony, and
   this exemption from the fears and tormenting desires of self-love,
   create a satisfaction in the will, which is above all the joys of
   intoxicating delights. Dwell, then, in your terrestrial paradise, and
   take good care not to leave it from a vain desire of knowing good and
   evil.

   We are never less alone than when we are in the society of a single
   faithful friend; never less deserted, than when we are carried in the
   arms of the All-powerful. Nothing is more affecting than the instant
   succor of God. What He sends by means of his creatures, contracts no
   virtue from that foul and barren channel; it owes everything to the
   source. And so, when the fountain breaks forth within the heart itself,
   we have no need of the creature. "God, who at sundry times and in
   divers manners, spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,
   hath, in these last days, spoken unto us by his Son." (Heb. i. 1,2.)
   Shall we then feel any regret that the feeble voice of the prophets has
   ceased? O how pure and powerful is the immediate voice of God in the
   soul! It is certain whenever Providence cuts off all the channels.
     __________________________________________________________________

  LETTER XL. The circumcision of the heart.

   Our eagerness to serve others, frequently arises from mere natural
   generosity and a refined self-love; it may soon turn into dislike and
   despair. But true charity is simple, and ever the same towards the
   neighbor, because it is humble, and never thinks of self. Whatever is
   not included in this pure charity, must be cut off.

   It is by the circumcision of the heart that we are made children and
   inheritors of the faith of Abraham, in order that we may, like him,
   quit our native country without knowing whither we go. Blessed lot! to
   leave all and deliver ourselves up to the jealousy of God, the knife of
   circumcision! Our own hand can effect nothing but superficial reforms;
   we do not know ourselves, and cannot tell where to strike; we should
   never light upon the spot that the hand of God so readily finds.
   Self-love arrests our hand and spares itself; it has not the courage to
   wound itself to the quick. And besides, the choice of the spot and the
   preparation for the blow, deaden its force. But the hand of God strikes
   in unexpected places, it finds the very joint of the harness, and
   leaves nothing unscathed. Self-love then becomes the patient; let it
   cry out, but see to it that it does not stir under the hand of God,
   lest it interfere with the success of the operation. It must remain
   motionless beneath the knife; all that is required is fidelity in not
   refusing a single stroke.

   I am greatly attached to John the Baptist, who wholly forgot himself
   that he might think only of Christ; he pointed to Him, he was but the
   voice of one crying in the wilderness to prepare the way, he sent Him
   all his disciples, and it was this conduct, far more than his solitary
   and austere life, that entitled him to be called the greatest among
   them that are born of women.

   The end.

Method of Prayer

     __________________________________________________________________

    A

    SHORT AND VERY EASY

METHOD OF PRAYER;

   WHICH ALL CAN PRACTICE WITH THE GREATEST FACILITY, AND ARRIVE

   IN A SHORT TIME, BY ITS MEANS, AT A HIGH DEGREE OF PERFECTION.

  BY MADAME GUYON.

   "Walk before me and be thou perfect."--Gen. xvii. 1.
     __________________________________________________________________

  THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE.

   This little treatise, conceived in great simplicity, was not originally
   intended for publication. It was written for a few individuals, who
   were desirous of loving God with all their heart. Many, however,
   because of the profit they received in reading the manuscript, wished
   to obtain copies, and, on this account alone, it was committed to the
   press.

   It still remains in its original simplicity. It contains no censure on
   the various divine leadings of others; on the contrary, it enforces the
   received teachings. The whole is submitted to the judgment of the
   learned and experienced; requesting them, however, not to stop at the
   surface, but to enter into the main design of the author, which is to
   induce the whole world to love God, and to serve Him with comfort and
   success, in a simple and easy manner, adapted to those little ones who
   are unqualified for learned and deep researches, but who earnestly
   desire to be truly devoted to God.

   An unprejudiced reader will find, hidden under the most common
   expressions, a secret unction, which will excite him to seek after that
   happiness which all should wish to enjoy.

   In asserting that perfection is easily attained, the word facility, is
   used; because God is, indeed found with facility, when we seek Him
   within ourselves. But some, perhaps, may urge that passage in St. John
   "Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me," (vii. 34); this apparent
   difficulty, however, is removed by another passage, where He, who
   cannot contradict himself, has said to all, "Seek and ye shall find,"
   (Matt. vii. 7). It is true, indeed, that he who would seek God, seeks
   Him where He is not; and, therefore, it is added, "Ye shall die in your
   sins." But he, who will take some trouble to seek God in his own heart,
   and sincerely forsake his sin, that he may draw near unto Him, shall
   infallibly find Him.

   A life of piety appears so frightful to many, and prayer of such
   difficult attainment, that they are discouraged from taking a single
   step towards it. But as the apprehended difficulty of an undertaking
   often causes despair of succeeding and reluctance in commencing, so its
   desirableness, and the idea that it is easy to accomplish, induce us to
   enter upon its pursuit with pleasure, and to pursue it with vigor. The
   advantages and facility of this way are therefore set forth in the
   following treatise.

   O were we once persuaded of the goodness of God toward his poor
   creatures, and of his desire to communicate Himself to them, we should
   not create ideal monsters, nor so easily despair of obtaining that good
   which He is so earnest to bestow: "He that spared not his own Son, but
   delivered him up for us all; how shall He not, with him, also freely
   give us all things?" (Rom. viii. 32). It needs only a little courage
   and perseverance; we have enough of both in our temporal concerns, but
   none at all in the one thing needful, (Luke x. 42).

   If any think that God is not easily to be found in this way, let them
   not on my testimony alter their minds, but let them try it, and their
   own experience will convince them, that the reality far exceeds all my
   representations of it.

   Beloved reader, pursue this little tract with a sincere and candid
   spirit, in lowliness of mind, and not with an inclination to criticize,
   and you will not fail to reap profit from it. It was written with a
   desire that you might wholly devote yourself to God; receive it then
   with a like desire: for it has no other design than to invite the
   simple and the child-like to approach their father, who delights in the
   humble confidence of his children, and is greatly grieved at their
   distrust. With a sincere desire, therefore, for your salvation, seek
   nothing from the unpretending method here proposed, but the love of
   God, and you shall assuredly obtain it.

   Without setting up our opinions above those of others, we mean only
   with sincerity to declare, from our own experience and the experience
   of others, the happy effects produced by thus simply following after
   the Lord.

   As this treatise was intended only to instruct in prayer, nothing is
   said of many things which we esteem, because they do not immediately
   relate to our main subject. It is, however, beyond a doubt, that
   nothing will be found herein to offend, provided it be read in the
   spirit with which it was written. And it is still more certain, that
   those who in right earnest make trial of the way, will find we have
   written the truth.

   It is Thou alone, O holy Jesus, who lovest simplicity and innocence,
   "and whose delight is to dwell with the children of men," (Prov. viii.
   31), with those who are, indeed, willing to become "little children,"
   (Matt. xviii. 3); it is Thou alone, who canst render this little work
   of any value, by imprinting it on the heart, and leading those who read
   it to seek Thee within themselves, where Thou reposest as in the
   manger, waiting to receive proofs of their love, and to give them
   testimony of thine. They lose these advantages by their own fault. But
   it belongeth unto thee, O child Almighty! uncreated Love! silent and
   all-containing Word! to make thyself loved, enjoyed and understood.
   Thou canst do it; and I know Thou wilt do it by this little work, which
   belongeth entirely to Thee, proceedeth wholly from Thee, and tendeth
   only to Thee!
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

   Introduction. That all are called to prayer, and by the aid of ordinary
   grace may put up the prayer of the heart, which is the great means of
   salvation, and which can be offered at all times, and by the most
   uninstructed.

   All are capable of prayer, and it is a dreadful misfortune that almost
   all the world have conceived the idea that they are not called to
   prayer. We are all called to prayer, as we are all called to salvation.

   Prayer is nothing but the application of the heart to God, and the
   internal exercise of love. St. Paul has enjoined us to "pray without
   ceasing;" (1 Thess. v. 17,) and our Lord bids us watch and pray, (Mark
   xiii. 33,37): all therefore may, and all ought to practise prayer. I
   grant that meditation is attainable but by few, for few are capable of
   it; and therefore, my beloved brethren who are athirst for salvation,
   meditative prayer is not the prayer which God requires of you, nor
   which we would recommend.

   2. Let all pray: you should live by prayer, as you should live by love.
   "I counsel you to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that ye may be
   rich." (Rev. iii. 18.) This is very easily obtained, much more easily
   than you can conceive.

   Come all ye that are athirst to the living waters, nor lose your
   precious moments in hewing our cisterns that will hold no water. (John
   vii. 37; Jer. ii. 13.) Come ye famishing souls, who find nought to
   satisfy you; come, and ye shall be filled! Come, ye poor afflicted
   ones, bending beneath your load of wretchedness and pain, and ye shall
   be consoled! Come, ye sick, to your physician, and be not fearful of
   approaching him because ye are filled with diseases; show them, and
   they shall be healed!

   Children, draw near to your Father, and he will embrace you in the arms
   of love! Come ye poor, stray, wandering sheep, return to your Shepherd!
   Come, sinners, to your Saviour! Come ye dull, ignorant, and illiterate,
   ye who think yourselves the most incapable of prayer! ye are more
   peculiarly called and adapted thereto. Let all without exception come,
   for Jesus Christ hath called ALL.

   Yet let not those come who are without a heart; they are excused; for
   there must be a heart before there can be love. But who is without a
   heart? O come, then, give this heart to God; and here learn how to make
   the donation.

   3. All who are desirous of prayer, may easily pray, enabled by those
   ordinary graces and gifts of the Holy Spirit which are common to all
   men.

   Prayer is the key to perfection, and the sovereign good; it is the
   means of delivering us from every vice, and obtaining us every virtue;
   for the one great means of becoming perfect, is to walk in the presence
   of God. He himself hath said, "Walk before me, and be thou perfect."
   (Gen. xvii. 1.) It is by prayer alone that we are brought into his
   presence, and maintained in it without interruption.

   4. You must, then, learn a species of prayer which may be exercised at
   all times; which does not obstruct outward employments; which may be
   equally practised by princes, kings, prelates, priests and magistrates,
   soldiers and children, tradesmen, laborers, women, and sick persons; it
   is not the prayer of the head, but of the heart.

   It is not a prayer of the understanding alone, for the mind of man is
   so limited in its operations that it can have but one object at a time;
   but it is the prayer of the heart which is not interrupted by the
   exercises of reason. Nothing can interrupt this prayer but disordered
   affections; and when once we have enjoyed God, and the sweetness of his
   love, we shall find it impossible to relish aught but himself.

   5. Nothing is so easily obtained as the possession and enjoyment of
   God. He is more present to us than we are to ourselves. He is more
   desirous of giving Himself to us than we are to possess Him; we only
   need to know how to seek Him, and the way is easier and more natural to
   us than breathing.

   Ah! ye who think yourselves so dull and fit for nothing, by prayer you
   may live on God himself with less difficulty or interruption that you
   live on the vital air. Will it not then be highly sinful to neglect
   prayer? But doubtless you will not, when you have learnt the method,
   which is the easiest in the world.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER II.

   1. First degree of prayer, practised in two ways; one by reading and
   meditation, the other by meditation alone.

   2,3. Rules and methods of meditation.

   4. Remedies for its difficulties.

   There are two ways of introducing some important practical or
   speculative truth, always preferring the practical, and proceeding
   thus: whatever truth you have chosen, read only a small portion of it,
   endeavoring to taste and digest it, to extract the essence and
   substance of it, and proceed no farther while any savor or relish
   remains in the passage: then take up your book again, and proceed as
   before, seldom reading more than half a page at a time.

   It is not the quantity that is read, but the manner of reading, that
   yields us profit. Those who read fast, reap no more advantage, than a
   bee would by only skimming over the surface of the flower, instead of
   waiting to penetrate into it, and extract its sweets. Much reading is
   rather for scholastic subjects, than divine truths; to receive profit
   from spiritual books, we must read as I have described; and I am
   certain that if that method were pursued, we should become gradually
   habituated to pray by our reading, and more fully disposed for its
   exercise.

   2. Meditation, which is the other method, is to be practised at an
   appropriated season, and not in the time of reading. I believe that the
   best manner of meditating is as follows:

   When by an act of lively faith, you are placed in the presence of God,
   read some truth wherein there is substance; pause gently thereon, not
   to employ the reason, but merely to fix the mind; observing that the
   principal exercise should ever be the presence of God, and that the
   subject, therefore, should rather serve to stay the mind, than exercise
   it in reasoning.

   Then let a lively faith in God immediately present in our inmost souls,
   produce an eager sinking into ourselves, restraining all our senses
   from wandering abroad: this serves to extricate us, in the first
   instance, from numerous distraints, to remove us far from external
   objects, and to bring us nigh to God, who is only to be found in our
   inmost centre, which is the Holy of Holies wherein he dwells. He has
   even promised to come and make his abode with him that doeth his will.
   (John xiv. 23.) St. Augustine blames himself for the time he lost in
   not having sought God, from the first, in this manner of prayer.

   3. When we are thus fully entered into ourselves, and warmly penetrated
   throughout with a lively sense of the Divine presence; when the senses
   are all recollected, and withdrawn from the circumference to the
   centre, and the soul is sweetly and silently employed on the truths we
   have read, not in reasoning, but in feeding thereon, and animating the
   will by affection, rather than fatiguing the understanding by study;
   when, I say, the affections are in this state, (which, however
   difficult it may appear at first, is, as I shall hereafter show, easily
   attainable,) we must allow them sweetly to repose, and, as it were,
   swallow what they have tasted.

   For as a person may enjoy the flavor of the finest viands in
   mastication, yet receive no nourishment from them, if he does not cease
   the action and swallow the food; so when our affections are enkindled,
   if we endeavor to stir them up yet more, we extinguish the flame, and
   the soul is deprived of its nourishment. We should, therefore, in a
   repose of love, full of respect and confidence, swallow the blessed
   food we have received. This method is highly necessary, and will
   advance the soul more in a short time, than any other in years.

   4. But as I have said that our direct and principal exercise should
   consist in the contemplation of the Divine presence, we should be
   exceedingly diligent in recalling our dissipated senses, as the most
   easy method of overcoming distractions; for a direct contest only
   serves to irritate and augment them; whereas, by sinking within, under
   a view by faith, of a present God, and simply recollecting ourselves,
   we wage insensibly very successful, though indirect war with them.

   It is proper here to caution beginners against wandering from truth to
   truth, and from subject to subject; the right way to penetrate every
   divine truth, to enjoy its full relish, and to imprint it on the heart,
   is to dwell upon it whilst its savor continues.

   Though recollection is difficult in the beginning, from the habit the
   soul has acquired of being always abroad, yet, when by the violence it
   has done itself, it becomes a little accustomed to it, the process is
   soon render perfectly easy; and this partly from the force of habit,
   and partly because God, whose one will towards his creatures is to
   communicate himself to them, imparts abundant grace, and an
   experimental enjoyment of his presence, which very much facilitate it.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER III.

   1. Method of meditative prayer for those who cannot read;

   2,3. Applied to the Lord's Prayer and to some of the attributes of God.

   4. Transition from the first to the second degree of prayer.

   Those who cannot read books, are not, on that account, excluded from
   prayer. The great book which teaches all things, and which is written
   all over, within and without, is Jesus Christ himself.

   The method they should practice is this: they should first learn this
   fundamental truth, that "the kingdom of God is within them," (Luke
   xvii. 21,) and that it must be sought there only.

   It is as incumbent on the clergy to instruct their parishioners in
   prayer, as in their catechism. It is true they tell them the end of
   their creation; but they do not give them sufficient instructions how
   they may attain it.

   They should be taught to begin by an act of profound adoration and
   annihilation before God, and closing the corporeal eyes, endeavor to
   open those of the soul; they should then collect themselves inwardly,
   and by a lively faith in God, as dwelling within them, pierce into the
   divine presence; not suffering the senses to wander abroad, but holding
   them as much as may be in subjection.

   2. They should then repeat the Lord's prayer in their native tongue;
   pondering a little upon the meaning of the words, and the infinite
   willingness of that God who dwells within them to become, indeed,
   "their father." In this state let them pour out their wants before him;
   and when they have pronounced the word, "father," remain a few moments
   in a reverential silence, waiting to have the will of this their
   heavenly Father made manifest to them.

   Again, the Christian, beholding himself in the state of a feeble child,
   soiled and sorely bruised by repeated falls, destitute of strength to
   stand, or of power to cleanse himself, should lay his deplorable
   situation open to his Father's view in humble confusion; occasionally
   intermingling a word or two of love and grief, and then again sinking
   into silence before Him. Then, continuing the Lord's prayer, let him
   beseech this King of Glory to reign in him, abandoning himself to God,
   that He may do it, and acknowledging his right to rule over him.

   If they feel an inclination to peace and silence, let them not continue
   the words of the prayer so long as this sensation holds; and when it
   subsides, let them go on with the second petition, "thy will be done on
   earth as it is in heaven!" upon which let these humble supplicants
   beseech God to accomplish in them, and by them, all his will, and let
   them surrender their hearts and freedom into his hands, to be disposed
   of as He pleases. When they find that the will should be employed in
   loving, they will desire to love, and will implore Him for his love;
   but all this will take place sweetly and peacefully: and so of the rest
   of the prayer, in which the clergy may instruct them.

   But they should not burthen themselves with frequent repetitions of set
   forms, or studied prayers; for the Lord's prayer once repeated as I
   have just described, will produce abundant fruit.

   3. At other times, they may place themselves as sheep before their
   Shepherd, looking up to Him for their true food: O divine Shepherd,
   Thou feedest thy flock with Thyself, and art indeed their daily bread.
   They may also represent to him the necessities of their families: but
   let all be done from this principal and one great view of faith, that
   God is within them.

   All our imaginations of God amount to nothing; a lively faith in his
   presence is sufficient. For we must not form any image of the Deity,
   though we may of Jesus Christ, beholding him in his birth, or his
   crucifixion, or in some other state or mystery, provided the soul
   always seeks Him in its own centre.

   On other occasions, we may look to him as a physician, and present for
   his healing virtue all our maladies; but always without perturbation,
   and with pauses from time to time, that the silence, being mingled with
   action, may be gradually extended, and our own exertion lessened; till
   at length, by continually yielding to God's operations, He gains the
   complete ascendancy, as shall be hereafter explained.

   4. When the divine presence is granted us, and we gradually begin to
   relish silence and repose, this experimental enjoyment of the presence
   of God introduces the soul into the second degree of prayer, which, by
   proceeding in the manner I have described, is attainable as well by the
   illiterate as by the learned; some privileged souls, indeed, are
   favored with it even from the beginning.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IV.

   1. Second degree of prayer, called here "The prayer of simplicity." At
   what time we reach it.

   2. How to offer and continue it.

   3. Requisites to offering it acceptably.

   Some call the second degree of prayer Contemplation, The prayer of
   faith and stillness, and others call it The prayer of simplicity. I
   shall here use this latter appellation, as being more just than that of
   contemplation, which implies a more advanced state than that I am now
   treating of.

   When the soul has been for some time exercised in the way I have
   mentioned, it gradually finds that it is enabled to approach God with
   facility; that recollection is attended with much less difficulty, and
   that prayer becomes easy, sweet, and delightful: it recognizes that
   this is the true way of finding God, and feels that " his name is as
   ointment poured forth." (Cant. i. 3.) The method must now be altered,
   and that which I describe must be pursued with courage and fidelity,
   without being disturbed at the difficulties we may encounter in the
   way.

   2. First, as soon as the soul by faith places itself in the presence of
   God, and becomes recollected before Him, let it remain thus for a
   little time in respectful silence.

   But if, at the beginning, in forming the act of faith, it feels some
   little pleasing sense of the Divine presence, let it remain there
   without being troubled for a subject, and proceed no farther, but
   carefully cherish this sensation while it continues. When it abates, it
   may excite the will by some tender affection; and if, by the first
   moving thereof, it finds itself reinstated in sweet peace, let it there
   remain; the fire must be gently fanned, but as soon as it is kindled,
   we must cease our efforts, lest we extinguish it by our activity.

   3. I would warmly recommend to all, never to finish prayer without
   remaining some little time afterward in a respectful silence. It is
   also of the greatest importance for the soul to go to prayer with
   courage, and to bring with it such a pure and disinterested love, as
   seeks nothing from God, but to please Him, and to do his will; for a
   servant who only proportions his diligence to his hope of reward, is
   unworthy of any recompense. Go then to prayer, not desiring to enjoy
   spiritual delights, but to be just as it pleases God; this will
   preserve your spirit tranquil in aridities as well as in consolation,
   and prevent your being surprised at the apparent repulses or absence of
   God.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER V.

   On various matters occurring in or belonging to the degree of prayer,
   that is to say,

   1. On aridities; which are caused by deprivation of the sensible
   presence of God for an admirable end, and which are to be met by acts
   of solid and peaceful virtue of mind and soul.

   2. Advantages of this course.

   Though God has no other desire than to impart Himself to the loving
   soul that seeks Him, yet He frequently conceals Himself from it, that
   it may be roused from sloth, and impelled to seek Him with fidelity and
   love. But with what abundant goodness does He recompense the
   faithfulness of his beloved! And how often are these apparent
   withdrawings of Himself succeeded by the caresses of love!

   At these seasons we are apt to believe that it proves our fidelity, and
   evinces a greater ardor of affection to seek Him by an exertion of our
   own strength and activity; or that such a course will induce Him the
   more speedily to revisit us. No, dear souls, believe me, this is not
   the best way in this degree of prayer; with patient love, with
   self-abasement and humiliation, with the reiterated breathings of an
   ardent but peaceful affection, and with silence full of veneration, you
   must await the return of the Beloved.

   2. Thus only can you demonstrate that it is Himself alone, and his good
   pleasure, that you seek; and not the selfish delights of your own
   sensations in loving Him. Hence it is said (Eccles. ii. 2,3): "Be not
   impatient in the time of dryness and obscurity; suffer the suspensions
   and delays of the consolations of God; cleave unto him, and wait upon
   him patiently, that thy life may increase and be renewed."

   Be patient in prayer, though during your whole lifetime you should do
   nothing else than wait the return of the Beloved in a spirit of
   humiliation, abandonment, contentment, and resignation. Most excellent
   prayer! and it may be intermingled with the sighings of plaintive love!
   This conduct indeed is most pleasing to the heart of God, and will,
   above all others, compel his return.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VI.

   1, 2. On the abandonment of self to God, its fruit, and its
   irrevocableness.

   3. Its nature; God requires it.

   4. Its practice.

   Here we must begin to abandon and give up our whole existence to God,
   from the strong and positive conviction, that the occurrences of every
   moment result from his immediate will and permission, and are just such
   as our state requires. This conviction will make us content with
   everything; and cause us to regard all that happens, not from the side
   of the creature, but from that of God.

   But, dearly beloved, whoever you are who sincerely wish to give
   yourselves up to God, I conjure you, that after having once made the
   donation, you take not yourselves back again; remember, a gift once
   presented, is no longer at the disposal of the giver.

   2. Abandonment is a matter of the greatest importance in our progress;
   it is the key to the inner court; so that he who knows truly how to
   abandon himself, will soon become perfect. We must therefore continue
   steadfast and immovable therein, without listening to the voice of
   natural reason. Great faith produces great abandonment; we must confide
   in God, "hoping against hope." (Rom. iv. 18.)

   3. Abandonment is the casting off all selfish care, that we may be
   altogether at the divine disposal. All Christians are exhorted to
   abandonment; for it is said to all; "Take no thought for the morrow;
   for your Heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.
   (Matt. vi. 32-34.) "In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall
   direct thy paths." (Prov. iii. 6.) "Commit thy works unto the Lord and
   thy thoughts shall be established." (Prov. xvi. 3.) "Commit thy way
   unto the Lord; trust also in Him and He will bring it to pass." (Psalm
   xxxvii. 5.)

   Our abandonment, then, should be, both in respect to external and
   internal things, an absolute giving up of all our concerns into the
   hands of God, forgetting ourselves and thinking only of Him; by which
   the heart will remain always disengaged, free, and at peace.

   4. It is practised by continually losing our own will in the will of
   God; renouncing every private inclination as soon as it arises, however
   good it may appear, that we may stand in indifference with respect to
   ourselves, and only will what God has willed from all eternity;
   resigning ourselves in all things, whether for soul or body, for time
   or eternity; forgetting the past, leaving the future to Providence, and
   devoting the present to God; satisfied with the present moment, which
   brings with it God's eternal order in reference to us, and is as
   infallible a declaration of his will, as it is inevitable and common to
   all; attributing nothing that befalls us to the creature, but regarding
   all things in God, and looking upon all, excepting only our sins, as
   infallibly proceeding from Him.

   Surrender yourselves then to be led and disposed of just as God
   pleases, with respect both to your outward and inward state.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VII.

   1. On suffering: that it should be accepted from the hand of God.

   2. Its use and profit.

   3. Its practice.

   Be patient under all the sufferings God sends; if your love to Him be
   pure, you will not seek Him less on Calvary, than on Tabor; and surely,
   He should be as much loved on that as on this, since it was on Calvary
   that he made the greatest display of love.

   Be not like those who give themselves to Him at one season, only to
   withdraw from Him at another. They give themselves only to be caressed,
   and wrest themselves back again, when they are crucified; or at least
   turn for consolation to the creature.

   2. No, beloved souls, you will not find consolation in aught but in the
   love of the cross, and in total abandonment; who savoreth not the
   cross, savoreth not the things that be of God. (See Matt. xvi. 23.) It
   is impossible to love God without loving the cross; and a heart that
   savors the cross, finds the bitterest things to be sweet; "To the
   hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet;" (Prov. xxvii. 7:) because it
   finds itself hungering for God, in proportion as it is hungering for
   the cross. God gives us the cross, and the cross gives us God.

   We may be assured that there is an internal advancement, when there is
   progress in the way of the cross; abandonment and the cross go hand in
   hand together.

   3. As soon as anything is presented in the form of suffering, and you
   feel a repugnance, resign yourself immediately to God with respect to
   it, and give yourself up to Him in sacrifice: you will then find, that
   when the cross arrives, it will not be so very burthensome, because you
   have yourself desired it. This, however does not prevent you from
   feeling its weight, as some have imagined; for when we do not feel the
   cross, we do not suffer. A sensibility to suffering is one of the
   principal parts of suffering itself. Jesus Christ himself chose to
   endure its utmost rigors. We often bear the cross in weakness, at other
   times in strength; all should be alike to us in the will of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VIII.

   1. On mysteries; God gives them in this state in reality.

   2,3. We must let Him bestow or withhold as seems good to Him, with a
   loving regard to his will.

   It will be objected, that, by this method, we shall have no mysteries
   imprinted on our minds; but so far is this from bring the case, that it
   is the peculiar means of imparting them to the soul. Jesus Christ, to
   whom we are abandoned, and whom we follow as the way, whom we hear as
   the truth, and who animates us as the life (John xiv. 6,) in imprinting
   himself on the soul, impresses there the characters of his different
   states. To bear all the states of Jesus Christ, is a much greater
   thing, than merely to meditate about them. St. Paul bore in his body
   the states of Jesus Christ; "I bear in my body," says he, "the marks of
   the Lord Jesus;" (Gal. vi. 17;) he does not say that he reasoned
   thereon.

   2. In this state of abandonment Jesus Christ frequently communicates
   some peculiar views, or revelations of his states: these we should
   thankfully accept, and dispose ourselves for what appears to be his
   will; receiving equally whatever frame He may bestow, and having no
   other choice, but that of ardently reaching after Him, of dwelling ever
   with Him, and of sinking into nothingness before Him, and accepting
   indiscriminately all his gifts, whether darkness or illumination,
   fecundity or barrenness, weakness or strength, sweetness or bitterness,
   temptations, distractions, pain, weariness, or uncertainty; and none of
   all these should, for one moment, retard our course.

   3. God engages some, for whole years, in the contemplation and
   enjoyment of a single mystery, the simple view or contemplation of
   which recollects the soul; let them be faithful to it; but as soon as
   God is pleased to withdraw this view from the soul, let it freely yield
   to the deprivation. Some are very uneasy at their inability to meditate
   on certain mysteries; but without reason, since an affectionate
   attachment to God includes in itself every species of devotion, and
   whoever is calmly united to God alone, is, indeed, most excellently and
   effectually applied to every divine mystery. Whoever loves God loves
   all that appertains to him.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IX.

   1.2. On virtue. All virtues come with God and are solidly and deeply
   implanted in the soul in this degree of the prayer of the heart.

   3. This takes place without difficulty.

   It is thus that we acquire virtue with facility and certainty; for as
   God is the principle of all virtues, we inherit all in the possession
   of Himself; and in proportion as we approach toward his possession, in
   like proportion do we receive the most eminent virtues. For all virtue
   is but as a mask, an outside appearance mutable as our garments, if it
   be not bestowed from within; then, indeed, it is genuine, essential,
   and permanent: "The King's daughter is all glorious within," says
   David. (Psalm xlv. 13.) These souls, above all others, practice virtue
   in the most eminent degree, though they advert not to any particular
   virtue. God, to whom they are united, leads them to the most extensive
   practice of it; He is exceedingly jealous over them, and permits them
   not the least pleasure.

   2. What a hungering for sufferings have those souls, who thus glow with
   divine love! How would they precipitate themselves into excessive
   austerities, where they permitted to pursue their own inclinations!
   They think of nought save how they may please their Beloved; and they
   begin to neglect and forget themselves; and as their love to God
   increases, so do self-detestation and disregard of the creature.

   3. O were this simple method once acquired, a way so suited to all, to
   the dull and ignorant as well as to the most learned, how easily would
   the whole church of God be reformed! Love only is required: "Love,"
   says St. Augustine, "and then do what you please." For when we truly
   love, we cannot have so much as a will to do anything that might offend
   the object of our affections.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER X.

   1. On mortification: that it is never perfect when it is solely
   exterior.

   2. But it must be accomplished by dwelling upon God within.

   3. Which, however, does not dispense with its outward practice to some
   degree.

   4. Hence, a sound conversion.

   I say further, that, in any other way, it is next to impossible to
   acquire a perfect mortification of the senses and passions.

   The reason is obvious: the soul gives vigor and energy to the senses,
   and the senses raise and stimulate the passions; a dead body has
   neither sensations nor passions, because its connection with the soul
   is dissolved. All endeavors merely to rectify the exterior impel the
   soul yet farther outward into that about which it is so warmly and
   zealously engaged. Its powers are diffused and scattered abroad; for,
   its whole attention being immediately directed to austerities and other
   externals, it thus invigorates those very senses it is aiming to
   subdue. For the senses have no other spring whence to derive their
   vigor than the application of the soul to themselves, the degree of
   their live and activity being proportioned to the degree of attention
   which the soul bestows upon them. This life of the senses stirs up and
   provokes the passions, instead of suppressing or subduing them;
   austerities may indeed enfeeble the body, but for the reasons just
   mentioned, can never take off the keenness of the senses, nor lessen
   their activity.

   2. The only method of effecting this, is inward recollection, by which
   the soul is turned wholly and altogether inward, to possess a present
   God. If it direct all its vigor and energy within, this simple act
   separates it from the senses, and, employing all its powers internally,
   it renders them faint; and the nearer it draws to God, the farther is
   it separated from self. Hence it is, that those in whom the attractions
   of grace are very powerful, find the outward man altogether weak and
   feeble, and even liable to faintings.

   3. I do not mean by this, to discourage mortification; for it should
   ever accompany prayer, according to the strength and state of the
   person, or as obedience demands. But I say, that mortification should
   not be our principal exercise; nor should we prescribe to ourselves
   such and such austerities, but simply following the internal
   attractions of grace, and being occupied with the divine presence,
   without thinking particularly on mortification, God will enable us to
   perform every species of it. He gives those who abide faithful to their
   abandonment to Him, no relaxation until He has subdued everything in
   them that remains to be mortified.

   We have only, then, to continue steadfast in the utmost attention to
   God, and all things will be perfectly done. All are not capable of
   outward austerities, but all are capable of this. In the mortification
   of the eye and ear, which continually supply the busy imagination with
   new subjects, there is little danger of falling into excess; but God
   will teach us this also, and we have only to follow his Spirit.

   4. The soul has a double advantage by proceeding thus; for, in
   withdrawing from outward objects, it constantly draws nearer to God;
   and besides the secret sustaining and preserving power and virtue which
   it receives, it is farther removed from sin the nearer it comes to Him;
   so that its conversion becomes firmly established as a matter of habit.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XI.

   1. On the perfect conversion which is the result of this kind of
   prayer; how it is accomplished.

   2,3. Two of its aids; the drawing of God, and the tendency of the soul
   to its centre.

   4. Its practice.

   "Turn ye unto Him from whom the children of Israel have so deeply
   revolted." (Isa. xxxi. 6.) Conversion is nothing more than turning from
   the creature in order to return to God.

   It is not perfect (however good and essential to salvation) when it
   consists simply in turning from sin to grace. To be complete, it should
   take place from without inwardly.

   When the soul is once turned toward God, it finds a wonderful facility
   in continuing steadfast in conversion; and the longer it remains thus
   converted, the nearer it approaches and the more firmly it adheres to
   God; and the nearer it draws to Him, it is of necessity the farther
   removed from the creature, which is so contrary to Him; so that it is
   so effectually established in conversion, that the state becomes
   habitual, and as it were natural.

   Now, we must not suppose that this is effected by a violent exertion of
   its own powers; for it is not capable of, nor should it attempt any
   other co-operation with divine grace, than that of endeavoring to
   withdraw itself from external objects, and to turn inwards; after which
   it has nothing farther to do, than to continue firm in its adherence to
   God.

   2. God has an attractive virtue which draws the soul more and more
   powerfully to Himself, and in attracting, He purifies; just as it is
   with a gross vapor exhaled by the sun, which, as it gradually ascends,
   is rarified and rendered pure; the vapor, indeed, contributes to its
   ascent only by its passivity; but the soul co-operates freely and
   voluntarily.

   This kind of introversion is very easy and advances the soul naturally,
   and without effort, because God is our centre. The centre always exerts
   a very powerful attractive virtue; and the more spiritual and exalted
   it is, the more violent and irresistible are its attractions.

   3. But besides the attracting virtue of the centre, there is, in every
   creature, a strong tendency to reunion with its centre, which is
   vigorous and active in proportion to the spirituality and perfection of
   the subject.

   As soon as anything is turned towards its centre, it is precipitated
   towards it with extreme rapidity, unless it be withheld by some
   invincible obstacle. A stone held in the hand is no sooner disengaged
   than by its own weight it falls to the earth as to its centre; so also
   water and fire, when unobstructed, flow incessantly towards their
   centre. Now, when the soul by its efforts to recollect itself, is
   brought into the influence of the central tendency, it falls gradually,
   without any other force than the weight of love, into its proper
   centre; and the more passive and tranquil it remains, the the freer
   from self-motion, the more rapidly it advances, because the energy of
   the central attractive virtue is unobstructed, and has full liberty for
   action. [6]

   4. All our care should therefore be directed towards acquiring the
   greatest degree of inward recollection; nor should we be discouraged by
   the difficulties we encounter in this exercise, which will soon be
   recompensed on the part of God, by such abundant supplies of grace, as
   will render it perfectly easy, provided we are faithful in meekly
   withdrawing our hearts from outward distractions and occupations, and
   returning to our centre, with affections full of tenderness and
   serenity. When at any time the passions are turbulent, a gentle retreat
   inwards to a present God, easily deadens them; any other way of
   opposing rather irritates than appeases them.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [6] This beautiful image comprehends the whole essence of the divine
   life, as understood by the teachers of the interior, and seems to
   contain as much truth as beauty. God is the great magnet of the soul,
   but of that only; and impurity or admixture prevents his full
   attractive power. If there were nothing of the kind in the soul, it
   would rush, under this all-powerful attraction, with irresistible and
   instantaneous speed, to be lost in God. But many load themselves with
   goods, or seize some part of earth or self with so tenacious a grasp,
   that they spend their whole lives without advancing at more than a
   snail's pace towards their centre; and it is only when God in love
   strikes their burden violently from their hands, that they begin to be
   conscious of the hinderance that detained them. If we will only suffer
   every weight to drop, and withdraw our hands from self, and every
   creature, there will be but little interval between our sacrifice and
   our resurrection. Some pious persons have objected to the passivity
   here inculcated, as though the soul were required to become dead, like
   an inanimate object, in order that God might do his pleasure with it.
   But this objection will vanish if it be considered that the life of the
   soul is in the will, and that this condition of utter passivity implies
   the highest state of activity of the will, in willing without any
   cessation, and with all its powers, that the will of God shall be done
   in it, and by it, and through it. See this further insisted upon in
   chapter xxi.--Editor.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XII.

   1. Another and more exalted degree of prayer, the prayer of the simple
   presence of God, or of Active Contemplation, of which very little is
   said, the subject being reserved for another treatise.

   2,3,4. How selfish activity merges here in an activity lively, full,
   abundant, divine, easy, and as it were natural; a state far different
   from that idleness and passivity objected to by the opponents of the
   inner life. The subject illustrated by several comparisons.

   5. Transition to Infused Prayer, in which the fundamental, vital
   activity of the soul is not lost, but is more abundantly and powerfully
   influenced (as are the faculties) by that of God.

   6. The facility of these methods of coming to God, and an exhortion to
   self abandonment.

   The soul that is faithful in the exercise of love and adherence to God,
   as above described, is astonished to feel Him gradually taking
   possession of its whole being; it now enjoys a continual sense of that
   presence which is become as it were natural to it; and this, as well as
   prayer, becomes a matter of habit. It feels an unusual serenity
   gradually diffusing itself over all its faculties. Silence now
   constitutes its whole prayer; whilst God communicates an infused love,
   which is the beginning of ineffable blessedness.

   O that I were permitted to pursue this subject, and describe some
   degrees of the endless progression of subsequent states? But I now
   write only for beginners; and shall therefore proceed no farther, but
   wait our Lord's time for developing what may be applicable to every
   state. [7]

   2. We must, however, urge it as a matter of the highest import, to
   cease self-action and self-exertion, that God himself may act alone: He
   says by the mouth of his prophet David, "Be still and know that I am
   God." (Psalm xlvi. 10.) But the centre is so infatuated with love and
   attachment to its own working, that it does not believe that it works
   at all unless it can feel, know, and distinguish all its operations. It
   is ignorant that its inability minutely to observe the manner of its
   motion, is occasioned by the swiftness of its progress; and that the
   operations of God, abounding more and more, absorb those of the
   creature; just as we see that the stars shine brightly before the sun
   rises, but gradually vanish as his light advances, and become
   invisible, not from want of light in themselves, but from the excess of
   it in him.

   The case is similar here; for there is a strong and universal light
   which absorbs all the little distinct lights of the soul; they grow
   faint and disappear under its powerful influence, and self-activity is
   now no longer distinguishable.

   3. Those greatly err, who accuse this prayer of inactivity, a charge
   that can only arise from inexperience. O! if they would but make some
   efforts towards the attainment of it, they would soon become full of
   light and knowledge in relation to it.

   This appearance of inaction is, indeed, not the consequence of
   sterility, but of abundance, as will be clearly perceived by the
   experienced soul, who will recognize that the silence is full and
   unctuous by reason of plenty.

   4. There are two kinds of people that keep silence; the one because
   they have nothing to say, the other because they have too much: the
   latter is the case in this state; silence is occasioned by excess and
   not by defect.

   To be drowned, and to die of thirst, are deaths widely different; yet
   water may be said to be the cause of both; abundance destroys in one
   case, and want in the other. So here the fullness of grace stills the
   activity of self; and therefore it is of the utmost importance to
   remain as silent as possible.

   The infant hanging at its mother's breast, is a lively illustration of
   our subject; it begins to draw the milk, by moving its little lips; but
   when its nourishment flows abundantly, it is content to swallow without
   effort; by any other course it would only hurt itself, spill the milk,
   and be obliged to quit the breast.

   We must act in like manner in the beginning of prayer, by moving the
   lips of the affections; but as soon as the milk of divine grace flows
   freely, we have nothing to do, but, in stillness, sweetly to imbibe it,
   and when it ceases to flow, again stir up the affections as the infant
   moves its lips. Whoever acts otherwise, cannot make the best use of
   this grace, which is bestowed to allure the soul into the repose of
   Love, and not to force it into the multiplicity of self.

   5. But what becomes of the babe that thus gently and without exertion,
   drinks in the milk? Who would believe that it could thus receive
   nourishment? Yet the more peacefully it feeds, the better it thrives.
   What, I say, becomes of this infant? It drops asleep on its mother's
   bosom. So the soul that is tranquil and peaceful in prayer, sinks
   frequently into a mystic slumber, wherein all its powers are at rest,
   till it is wholly fitted for that state, of which it enjoys these
   transient anticipations. You see that in this process the soul is led
   naturally, without trouble, effort, art or study.

   The interior is not a strong hold, to be taken by storm and violence;
   but a kingdom of peace, which is to be gained only by love. If any will
   thus pursue the little path I have pointed out, it will lead them to
   infused prayer. God demands nothing extraordinary nor too difficult; on
   the contrary, He is greatly pleased by a simple and child-like conduct.

   6. The most sublime attainments in religion, are those which are
   easiest reached; the most necessary ordinances are the least difficult.
   It is thus also in natural things; if you would reach the sea, embark
   on a river, and you will be conveyed to it insensibly and without
   exertion. Would you go to God, follow this sweet and simple path, and
   you will arrive at the desired object, with an ease and expedition that
   will amaze you.

   O that you would but once make the trial! how soon would you find that
   all I have said is too little, and that your own experience will carry
   you infinitely beyond it! What is it you fear? why do you not instantly
   cast yourself into the arms of Love, who only extended them on the
   cross that He might embrace you? What risk do you run in depending
   solely on God, and abandoning yourself wholly to Him? Ah! he will not
   deceive you, unless by bestowing an abundance beyond your highest
   hopes; but those who expect all from themselves, may hear this rebuke
   of God by his prophet Isaiah, "Ye have wearied yourselves in the
   multiplicity of your ways, and have not said, let us rest in peace."
   (Isa. lvii. 10, vulgate.)

   Torrents," and less diffusely in the "Concise View," follows the
   present treatise.--Editor.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIII.

   1. On the rest before God present in the soul in a wonderful way.

   2. Fruits of this peaceful presence.

   3. Practical advice.

   The soul advanced thus far, has no need of any other preparation than
   its quietude: for now the presence of God, during the day, which is the
   great effect, or rather continuation of prayer, begins to be infused,
   and almost without intermission. The soul certainly enjoys transcendent
   blessedness, and finds that God is more intimately present to it than
   it is to itself.

   The only way to find him is by introversion. No sooner do the bodily
   eyes close, than the soul is wrapt in prayer: it is amazed at so great
   a blessing, and enjoys an internal converse, which external matters
   cannot interrupt.

   2. The same may be said of this species of prayer, that is said of
   wisdom: "all good things come together with her." (Wisdom vii. 11.) For
   virtues flow from this soul into exercise with so much sweetness and
   facility, that they appear natural to it, and the living spring within
   breaks forth abundantly into a facility for all goodness, and an
   insensibility to all evil.

   3. Let it then remain faithful in this state; and beware of choosing or
   seeking any other disposition whatever than this simple rest, as a
   preparative either to confession or communion, to action or prayer; for
   its sole business is to suffer itself to be filled with this divine
   effusion. I would not be understood to speak of the preparations
   necessary for ordinances, but of the most interior disposition in which
   they can be received.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIV.

   1,2. On interior silence; its reason; God recommends it.

   3. Exterior silence, retirement and recollection contribute to it.

   "The Lord is in his holy temple; let all the earth keep silence before
   him." (Hab. ii. 20.) The reason why inward silence is so indispensable,
   is, because the Word is essential and eternal, and necessarily requires
   dispositions in the soul in some degree correspondent to His nature, as
   a capacity for the reception of Himself. Hearing is a sense formed to
   receive sounds, and is rather passive than active, admitting, but not
   communicating sensation; and if we would hear, we must lend the ear for
   that purpose. Christ, the eternal Word, who must be communicated to the
   soul to give it new life, requires the most intense attention to his
   voice, when He would speak within us.

   2. Hence it is so frequently enjoined upon us in sacred writ, to listen
   and be attentive to the voice of God; I quote a few of the numerous
   exhortations to this effect: "Hearken unto me, my people, and give ear
   unto me, O my nation!" (Isa. li. 4,) and again "Hear me, all ye whom I
   carry in my bosom, and bear within my bowels:" (Isa. xlvi. 3,) and
   further by the Psalmist, "Hearken, O daughter! and consider, and
   incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's
   house; so shall the king greatly desire thy beauty." (Ps. xlv. 10,11.)

   We must forget ourselves, and all self-interest, and listen and be
   attentive to God; these two simple actions, or rather passive
   dispositions, produce the love of that beauty, which He himself
   communicates.

   3. Outward silence is very requisite for the cultivation and
   improvement of inward; and, indeed, it is impossible we should become
   truly interior, without loving silence and retirement. God saith by the
   mouth of his prophet, "I will lead her into solitude, and there will I
   speak to her heart (Hos. ii. 14, vulg.); and unquestionably the being
   internally engaged with God is wholly incompatible with being
   externally busied about a thousand trifles.

   When, through weakness, we become as it were uncentered, we must
   immediately turn again inward; and this process we must repeat as often
   as our distractions recur. It is a small matter to be devout and
   recollected for an hour or half hour, if the unction and spirit of
   prayer do not continue with us during the whole day.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XV.

   1,2. On the examination of conscience; how it is performed in this
   state, and that by God himself.

   3,4. On the confession, contrition, and forgetfulness or remembrance of
   faults in this state.

   5. This is not applicable to the previous degree, Communion.

   Self-examination should always precede confession, but the manner of it
   should be conformable to the state of the soul. The business of those
   that are advanced to the degree of which we now treat, is to lay their
   whole souls open before God, who will not fail to enlighten them, and
   enable them to see the peculiar nature of their faults. This
   examination, however, should be peaceful and tranquil; and we should
   depend on God for the discovery and knowledge of our sins, rather than
   on the diligence of our own scrutiny.

   When we examine with effort, we are easily deceived, and betrayed by
   self-love into error: "We call the evil good, and the good evil," (Isa.
   v. 20); but when we lie in full exposure before the Sun of
   Righteousness, his divine beams render the smallest atoms visible. We
   must, then, forsake self, and abandon our souls to God, as well in
   examination as confession.

   2. When souls have attained to this species of prayer, no fault escapes
   the reprehension of God; no sooner are they committed than they are
   rebuked by an inward burning and tender confusion. Such is the scrutiny
   of Him who suffers no evil to be concealed; and the only way is to turn
   simply to God, and bear the pain and correction He inflicts.

   As He becomes the incessant examiner of the soul, it can now no longer
   examine itself; and if it be faithful in its abandonment, experience
   will prove that it is much more effectually explored by his divine
   light, than by all its own carefulness.

   3. Those who tread these paths should be informed of a matter
   respecting their confusion, in which they are apt to err. When they
   begin to give an account of their sins, instead of the regret and
   contrition they had been accustomed to feel, they find that love and
   tranquility sweetly pervade and take possession of their souls: now
   those who are not properly instructed are desirous of resisting this
   sensation, and forming an act of contrition, because they have heard,
   and with truth, that this is requisite. But they are not aware that
   they thereby lose the genuine contrition, which is this infused love,
   and which infinitely surpasses any effect produced by self-exertion,
   comprehending the other acts in itself as in one principal act, in much
   higher perfection than if they were distinctly perceived.

   Let them not be troubled to do otherwise, when God acts so excellently
   in and for them. To hate sin in this manner, is to hate it as God does.
   The purest love is that which is of his immediate operation in the
   soul; why should we then be so eager for action? Let us remain in the
   state He assigns us, agreeably to the instructions of the wise man:
   "Put your confidence in God; remain in quiet where he hath placed you."
   (Eccles. xi. 22.)

   4. The soul will also be amazed at finding a difficulty in calling its
   faults to remembrance. This, however, should cause no uneasiness,
   first, because this forgetfulness of our faults is some proof of our
   purification from them, and, in this degree of advancement, it is best
   to forget whatever concerns ourselves that we may remember only God.
   Secondly, because, when confession is our duty, God will not fail to
   make known to us our greatest faults; for then He himself examines; and
   the soul will feel the end of examination more perfectly accomplished,
   than it could possibly have been by all our own endeavors.

   5. These instructions, however, would be altogether unsuitable to the
   preceding degrees, while the soul continues in its active state,
   wherein it is right and necessary that it should an all things exert
   itself, in proportion to its advancement. As to those who have arrived
   at this more advanced state, I exhort them to follow these
   instructions, and not to vary their simple occupations even on
   approaching the communion; let them remain in silence, and suffer God
   to act freely. He cannot be better received than by Himself.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVI.

   1. On reading and vocal prayers; they should be limited.

   2. Not to be used against our interior drawing, unless they are of
   obligation.

   The method of reading in this state, is to cease when you feel yourself
   recollected, and remain in stillness, reading but little, and always
   desisting when thus internally attracted.

   2. The soul that is called to a state of inward silence, should not
   encumber itself with vocal prayers; whenever it makes use of them, and
   finds a difficulty therein, and an attraction to silence, let it not
   use constraint by persevering, but yield to the internal drawing,
   unless the repeating such prayers be a matter of obligation. In any
   other case, it is much better not to set forms, but wholly given up to
   the leadings of the Holy Spirit; and in this way every species of
   devotion is fulfilled in a most eminent degree.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVII.

   1. On petitions; those which are self-originated cease; and their place
   is supplied by those of the Spirit of God.

   2. Abandonment and faith necessary here.

   The soul should not be surprised at feeling itself unable to offer up
   to God such petitions as had formerly been made with facility; for now
   the Spirit maketh intercession for it according to the will of God;
   that Spirit which helpeth our infirmities; "for we know not what we
   should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit itself maketh intercession
   for us with groanings which cannot be uttered." (Rom. viii. 26.) We
   must second the designs of God, which tend to divest us of all our own
   operations, that his may be substituted in their place.

   2. Let this, then, be done in you; and suffer not yourself to be
   attached to anything, however good it may appear; it is no longer such
   to you, if it in any measure turns you aside from what God desires of
   you. For the divine will is preferable to every other good. Shake off,
   then, all self-interest, and live by faith and abandonment; here it is
   that genuine faith begins truly to operate.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVIII.

   1. On faults committed in the state. We must turn from them to God
   without trouble or discouragement.

   2. The contrary course weakens us and is opposed to the practice of
   humble souls.

   Should we either wander among externals, or commit a fault, we must
   instantly turn inwards; for having departed thereby from God, we should
   as soon as possible turn toward Him, and suffer the penalty which He
   inflicts.

   It is of great importance to guard against vexation on account of our
   faults; it springs from a secret root of pride, and a love of our own
   excellence; we are hurt at feeling what we are.

   2. If we become discouraged, we are the more enfeebled; and from our
   reflections on our imperfections, a chagrin arises, which is often
   worse than the imperfection themselves.

   The truly humble soul is not surprised at its defects or failings; and
   the more miserable it beholds itself, the more it abandons itself to
   God, and presses for a more intimate alliance with Him, seeing the need
   it has of his aid. We should the rather be induced to act thus, as God
   himself has said, "I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which
   thou shalt go; I will guide thee with mine eye." (Psalm xxxii. 8.)
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIX.

   1. On distractions and temptations; the remedy for them is to turn to
   God.

   2. This is the practice of the saints, and there is danger in any other
   way.

   A direct struggle with distractions and temptations rather serves to
   augment them, and withdraws the soul from that adherence to God, which
   should ever be its sole occupation. We should simply turn away from the
   evil, and draw yet nearer to God. A little child, on perceiving a
   monster, does not wait to fight with it, and will scarcely turn its
   eyes toward it, but quickly shrinks into the bosom of its mother, in
   assurance of its safety. "God is in the midst of her," says the
   Psalmist, "she shall not be moved; God shall help her, and that right
   early." (Psalm xlvi. 5.)

   2. If we do otherwise, and in our weakness attempt to attack our
   enemies, we shall frequently find ourselves wounded, if not totally
   defeated: but, by remaining in the simple presence of God, we shall
   find instant supplies of strength for our support. This was the
   resource of David: "I have set," says he, "the Lord always before me;
   because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. Therefore my
   heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth; my flesh also shall rest in
   hope." (Psalm xvi. 8,9.) And it is said in Exodus, "The Lord shall
   fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace." (Exod. xiv. 14.)
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XX.

   1,2. Prayer divinely explained as a devotional sacrifice, under the
   similitude of incense.

   3. Our annihilation in this sacrifice.

   4,5. Solidity and fruit of this prayer according to the Gospel.

   Both devotion and sacrifice are comprehended in prayer, which,
   according to St. John is an incense, the smoke whereof ascendeth unto
   God; therefore it is said in the Apocalypse, that "unto the angel was
   given much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all
   saints." (Rev. viii. 3.)

   Prayer is the effusion of the heart in the presence of God: "I have
   poured out my soul before the Lord," said the mother of Samuel. (1 Sam.
   i. 15.) The prayer of the wise men at the feet of Christ in the stable
   of Bethlehem, was signified by the incense they offered.

   2. Prayer is a certain warmth of love, melting, dissolving, and
   sublimating the soul, and causing it to ascend unto God, and, as the
   soul is melted, odors rise from it; and these sweet exhalations proceed
   from the consuming fire of love within.

   This is illustrated in the Canticles, (i. 12,) where the spouse says,
   "While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the
   smell thereof." The table is the centre of the soul; and when God is
   there, and we know how to dwell near, and abide with Him, the sacred
   presence gradually dissolves the hardness of the soul, and, as it
   melts, fragrance issues forth; hence it is, that the Beloved says of
   his spouse, in seeing her soul melt when he spoke, "Who is this that
   cometh out of the wilderness, like pillars of smoke perfumed with myrrh
   and frankincense?" (Cant. v. 6; iii. 6.)

   3. Thus does the soul ascend to God, by giving up self to the
   destroying and annihilating power of divine love. This is a state of
   sacrifice essential to the Christian religion, in which the soul
   suffers itself to be destroyed and annihilated, that it may pay homage
   to the sovereignty of God; as it is written, "The power of the Lord is
   great, and he is honored only by the humble." (Eccles. iii. 20.) By the
   destruction of self, we acknowledge the supreme existence of God. We
   must cease to exist in self, in order that the Spirit of the Eternal
   Word may exist in us: it is by the giving up of our own life, that we
   give place to his coming; and in dying to ourselves, He himself lives
   in us.

   We must surrender our whole being to Christ Jesus, and cease to live
   any longer in ourselves, that He may become our life; "that being dead,
   our life may be hid with Christ in God." (Col. iii. 3.) "Pass ye into
   me," sayeth God, "all ye who earnestly seek after me." (Eccles. xxi.
   16.) But how is it we pass into God? In no way but by leaving and
   forsaking ourselves, that we may be lost in Him; and this can be
   effected only by annihilation, which, being the true prayer of
   adoration, renders unto God alone, all blessing, honor, glory, and
   power, forever and ever." (Rev. v. 13.)

   4. This prayer of truth; it is "worshipping God in spirit and in
   truth:" (John iv. 23.) "In spirit," because we enter into the purity of
   that Spirit which prayeth within us, and are drawn forth from our own
   carnal and human method; "in truth," because we are thereby placed in
   the truth of the all of God, and the nothing of the creature.

   There are but these two truths, the All and the Nothing; everything
   else is falsehood. We can pay due honor to the All of God, only in our
   own Annihilation; which is no sooner accomplished, that He, who never
   suffers a void in nature, instantly fills us with Himself.

   Ah! did we but know the virtues and the blessings which the soul
   derives from this prayer, we should not be willing to do anything else;
   It is the pearl of great price; the hidden treasure, (Matt. xiii.
   44,45,) which, whoever findeth, selleth freely all that he hath to
   purchase it; it is the well of living water, which springeth up unto
   everlasting life. It is the adoration of God "in spirit and in truth:"
   (John iv. 14-23:) and it is the full performance of the purest
   evangelical precepts.

   5. Jesus Christ assures us, that the "kingdom of God is within us:"
   (Luke xvii. 21:) and this is true in two senses: first, when God
   becomes so fully Saviour and Lord in us, that nothing resists his
   domination, then our interior is his kingdom; and again, when we
   possess God, who is the Supreme Good, we possess his kingdom also,
   wherein there is fulness of joy, and where we attain the end of our
   creation. Thus it is said, "to serve God is to reign." The end of our
   creation, indeed, is to enjoy God, even in this life; but, alas! who
   thinks of it?
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXI.

   The objections of slothfulness and inactivity made to this form of
   prayer fully met, and the truth shown that the soul acts nobly,
   forcibly, calmly, quickly, freely, simply, sweetly, temperately, and
   certainly; but in dependence upon God, and moved by his Holy Spirit:
   the restless and selfish activity of nature being destroyed, and the
   life of God communicated by union with Him.

   Some persons, when they hear of the prayer of silence, falsely imagine
   that the soul remains stupid, dead, and inactive; but it unquestionably
   acts more nobly and more extensively than it had ever done before; for
   God himself is its mover, and it now acts by the agency of his Spirit.
   St. Paul would have us led by the Spirit of God. (Rom. viii. 14.)

   It is not meant that we should cease from action; but that we should
   act through the internal agency of his grace. This is finely
   represented by the prophet Ezekiel's vision of the wheels, which had a
   living Spirit; and whithersoever the Spirit was to go, they went; they
   ascended and descended as they were moved; for the Spirit of life was
   in them, and they returned not when they went. (Ezek. i. 18.) Thus the
   soul should be equally subservient to the will of that vivifying Spirit
   which is in it, and scrupulously faithful to follow only as that moves.
   These motions never tend to return in reflections on the creatures or
   self; but go forward in an incessant approach toward the end.

   2. This activity of the soul is attended with the utmost tranquility.
   When it acts of itself, the act is forced and constrained, and,
   therefore, it is more easily distinguished; but when the action is
   under the influence of the Spirit of grace, it is so free, so easy, and
   so natural, that it almost seems as if we did not act at all. "He
   brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me, because He
   delighted in me." (Ps. xviii. 19.)

   When the soul is in its central tendency, or in other words, is
   returned through recollection into itself, from that moment, the
   central attraction becomes a most potent activity, infinitely
   surpassing in energy every other species. Nothing, indeed, can equal
   the swiftness of this tendency to the centre; and though an activity,
   yet it is so noble, so peaceful, so full of tranquility, so natural,
   and so spontaneous, that it appears to the soul as if it were none at
   all.

   When a wheel rolls slowly we can easily perceive its parts; but when
   its motion is rapid, we can distinguish nothing. So the soul which
   rests in God, has an activity exceedingly noble and elevated, yet
   altogether peaceful; and the more peaceful it is, the swifter is its
   course; because it is given up to that Spirit by whom it is moved and
   directed.

   3. This attracting Spirit is no other than God himself, who, in drawing
   us, causes us to run to Him. How well did the spouse understand this,
   when she said, "Draw me, we will run after thee." (Cant. i. 4.) Draw me
   unto Thee, O my divine centre, by the secret springs of my existence,
   and all my powers and senses shall follow Thee! This simple attraction
   is both an ointment to heal and a perfume to allure: we follow, saith
   she, the fragrance of thy perfumes; and though so powerful an
   attraction, it is followed by the soul freely, and without constraint;
   for it is equally delighted as forcible; and whilst it attracts by its
   power, it carries us away by its sweetness. "Draw me," says the spouse,
   "and we will run after thee." She speaks of and to herself: "draw me,"
   --behold the unity of the centre which is drawn! "we will run,"--behold
   the correspondence and course of all the senses and powers in following
   the attraction of the centre!

   4. Instead, then, of encouraging sloth, we promote the highest
   activity, by inculcating a total dependence of the Spirit of God, as
   our moving principle; for it is in Him, and by Him alone, that we live
   and move, and have our being. (Acts xvii. 28.) This meek dependence on
   the Spirit of God is indispensably necessary, and causes the soul
   shortly to attain the unity and simplicity in which it was created.

   We must, therefore, forsake our multifarious activity, to enter into
   the simplicity and unity of God, in whose image we were originally
   formed. (Gen. i. 27.) "The Spirit is one and manifold, (Wisdom vii.
   22,) and his unity does not preclude his multiplicity. We enter into
   his unity when we are united to his Spirit, and by that means have one
   and the same spirit with Him; and we are multiplied in respect to the
   outward execution of his will, without any departure from our state of
   union.

   In this way, when we are wholly moved by the divine Spirit, which is
   infinitely active, our activity must, indeed, be more energetic than
   that which is merely our own. We must yield ourselves to the guidance
   of "wisdom, which is more moving than any motion," (Wisdom vii. 24,)
   and by abiding in dependence upon its action, our activity will be
   truly efficient.

   5. "All things were made by the Word, and without Him was not anything
   made, that was made." (John i. 3.) God originally formed us in his own
   image and likeness; He breathed into us the Spirit of his Word, that
   breath of Life (Gen. ii. 7) which He gave us at our creation, in the
   participation whereof the image of God consisted. Now, this Life is
   one, simple, pure, intimate, and always fruitful.

   The devil having broken and deformed the divine image in the soul by
   sin, the agency of the same Word whose Spirit was inbreathed at our
   creation, is absolutely necessary for its renovation. It was necessary
   that it should be He, because He is the express image of his Father;
   and no image can be repaired by its own efforts, but must remain
   passive for that purpose under the hand of the workman.

   Our activity should, therefore, consist in placing ourselves in a state
   of susceptibility to divine impressions, and pliability to all the
   operations of the Eternal Word. Whilst tablet is unsteady, the painter
   is unable to produce a correct picture upon it, and every movement of
   self is productive of erroneous lineaments; it interrupts the work and
   defeats the design of this adorable Painter. We must then remain in
   peace, and move only when He moves us. Jesus Christ hath life in
   himself, (John v. 26,) and He must give life to every living thing.

   The spirit of the church of God is the spirit of the divine movement.
   Is she idle, barren, or unfruitful? No; she acts, but her activity is
   in dependence upon the Spirit of God, who moves and governs her. Just
   so should it be in her members; that they may be spiritual children of
   the Church, they must be moved by the Spirit.

   6. As all action is estimable only in proportion to the grandeur and
   dignity of the efficient principle, this action is incontestably more
   noble than any other. Actions produced by a divine principle, are
   divine; but creaturely actions, however good they appear, are only
   human, or at least virtuous, even when accompanied by grace.

   Jesus Christ says that He has life in Himself: all other beings have
   only a borrowed life; but the Word has life in Himself; and being
   communicative of his nature, He desires to bestow it upon man. We
   should therefore make room for the influx of this life, which can only
   be done by the ejection and loss of the Adamical life, and the
   suppression of the activity of self. This is agreeable to the assertion
   of St. Paul, "If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things
   are passed away; behold, all things are become new," (2 Cor. v. 17;)
   but this state can be accomplished only by dying to ourselves, and to
   all our own activity, that the activity of God may be substituted in
   its place.

   Instead, therefore, of prohibiting activity, we enjoin it; but in
   absolute dependence on the Spirit of God, that his activity may take
   the place of our own. This can only be effected by the consent of the
   creature; and this concurrence can only be yielded by moderating our
   own action, that the activity of God may, little by little, be wholly
   substituted for it.

   7. Jesus Christ has exemplified this in the Gospel. Martha did what was
   right; but because she did it in her own spirit, Christ rebuked her.
   The spirit of man is restless and turbulent; for which reason he does
   little, though he seems to do a great deal. "Martha," says Christ,
   "thou art careful and troubled about many things; but one thing is
   needful; and Mary hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken
   away from her." (Luke x. 41,42.) And what was it Mary had chosen?
   Repose, tranquility, and peace. She had apparently ceased to act, that
   the Spirit of Christ might act in her; she had ceased to live, that
   Christ might be her life.

   This shows how necessary it is to renounce ourselves, and all our
   activity, to follow Christ; for we cannot follow Him, if we are not
   animated by his Spirit. Now that his Spirit may gain admittance, it is
   necessary that our own should be expelled: "He that is joined unto the
   Lord," says St. Paul, "is one spirit." (1 Cor. vi. 17.) And David said
   it was good for him to draw near unto the Lord, and to put his trust in
   him. (Psalm lxxiii. 28.) What is this drawing near? it is the beginning
   of union.

   8. Divine union has its commencement, its progress, its achievement,
   and its consummation. It is at first an inclination towards God. When
   the soul is introverted in the manner before described, it gets within
   the influence of the central attraction, and acquires an eager desire
   after union; this is the beginning. It then adheres to Him when it has
   got nearer and nearer, and finally becomes one, that is, one spirit
   with Him; and then it is that spirit which had wandered from God,
   returns again to its end.

   9. Into this way, then, which is the divine motion, and the spirit of
   Jesus Christ, we must necessarily enter. St. Paul says, "If any man
   have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his" (Rom. viii. 9):
   therefore, to be Christ's, we must be filled with his Spirit, and
   emptied of our own. The Apostle, in the same passage, proved the
   necessity of this divine influence. "As many," says he, "as are led by
   the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God." (Rom. viii. 14.)

   The spirit of divine filiation is, then, the spirit of divine motion:
   he therefore adds, "Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to
   fear; but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby ye cry Abba,
   Father." This spirit is no other than the spirit of Christ, through
   which we participate in his filiation; "The Spirit beareth witness with
   our spirit that we are the children of God."

   When the soul yields itself to the influence of this blessed Spirit, it
   perceives the testimony of its divine filiation; and it feels also,
   with superadded joy, that it has received, not the spirit of bondage,
   but of liberty, even the liberty of the children of God; it then finds
   that it acts freely and sweetly, though with vigor and infallibility.

   10. The spirit of divine action is so necessary in all things, that St.
   Paul, in the same passage, founds that necessity on our ignorance with
   respect to what we pray for: "The Spirit," says he, "also helpeth our
   infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought; but
   the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us, with groanings which
   cannot be uttered." This is plain enough; if we know not what we stand
   in need of, nor how to pray as we ought for those things which are
   necessary, and if the Spirit which is in us, and to which we resign
   ourselves, must ask for us, should we not permit Him to give vent to
   his unutterable groanings in our behalf?

   This Spirit is the Spirit of the Word, which is always heard, as He
   says himself: "I knew that thou hearest me always;" (John xi. 42;) and
   if we freely admit this Spirit to pray and intercede for us, we also
   shall be always heard. And why? Let us learn from the same great
   Apostle, that skillful Mystic, and Master of the interior life, where
   he adds, "He that searcheth the heart, knoweth what is the mind of the
   Spirit; because he maketh intercession for the saints, according to the
   will of God" (Rom. viii. 27): that is to say, the Spirit demands only
   what is conformable to the will of God. The will of God is that we
   should be saved, and that we should become perfect: He, therefore,
   intercedes for all that is necessary for our perfection.

   11. Why, then, should we be burthened with superfluous cares, and weary
   ourselves in the multiplicity of our ways, without ever saying, let us
   rest in peace. God himself invites us to cast all our care upon Him;
   and He complains in Isaiah, with ineffable goodness, that the soul had
   expended its powers and its treasures on a thousand external objects,
   when there was so little to do to attain all it need desire.
   "Wherefore," saith God, "do you spend money for that which is not
   bread; and your labor for that which satisfieth not? Hearken diligently
   unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight
   itself in fatness." (Isa. lv. 2.)

   Oh! did we but know the blessedness of thus hearkening to God, and how
   greatly the soul is strengthened by such a course! "Be silent, O all
   flesh, before the Lord" (Zech. ii. 13); all must cease as soon as He
   appears. But to engage us still farther to an abandonment without
   reservation, God assures us, by the same Prophet, that we need fear
   nothing, because he takes a very special care of us; "Can a woman
   forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the
   son of her womb? Yes, she may forget; yet will not I forget thee."
   (Isa. xlix. 15.) O words full of consolation! Who after that will fear
   to abandon himself wholly to the guidance of God?
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXII.

   1-6. Distinction between inward and outward acts; in this state the
   acts of the soul are inward, but habitual, continued, direct, lasting,
   deep, simple, unconscious, and resembling a gentle and perpetual
   sinking into the ocean of Divinity.

   7,8. A comparison.

   9. How to act when we perceive no attraction.

   Acts are distinguished into external and internal. External acts are
   those which appear outwardly, and bear relation to some sensible
   object, and have no moral character, except such as they derive from
   the principle from which they proceed. I intend here to speak only of
   internal acts, those energies of the soul, by which it turns internally
   towards some objects, and away from others.

   2. If during my application to God, I should form a will to change the
   nature of my act, I should thereby withdraw myself from God and turn to
   created objects, and that in a greater or less degree according to the
   strength of the act: and if, when I am turned towards the creature, I
   would return to God, I must necessarily form an act for that purpose;
   and the more perfect this act is, the more complete is the conversion.

   Till conversion is perfected, many reiterated acts are necessary; for
   it is with some progressive, though with others it is instantaneous. My
   act, however, should consist in a continual turning to God, an exertion
   of every faculty and power of the soul purely for Him, agreeably to the
   instructions of the son of Sirach: "Re-unite all the motions of thy
   heart in the holiness of God" (Eccles. xxx. 24,); and to the example of
   David, "I will keep my whole strength for thee," (Psalm lix. 9, vulg.)
   For we have strayed from our heart by sin, and it is our heart only
   that God requires: "My son give me thine heart, and let thine eye
   observe my ways." (Prov. xxiii. 26.) To give the heart to God, is to
   have the whole energy of the soul ever centering in Him, that we may be
   rendered conformable to his will. We must, therefore, continue
   invariably turned to God, from our first application to Him.

   But the spirit being unstable, and the soul accustomed to turn to
   external objects, it is easily distracted. This evil, however, will be
   counteracted if, on perceiving the wandering, we, by a pure act of
   return to God, instantly replace ourselves in Him; and this act
   subsists as long as the conversion lasts, by the powerful influence of
   a simple and unfeigned return to God.

   3. As many reiterated acts form a habit, the soul contracts the habit
   of conversion; and that act which was before interrupted and distinct
   becomes habitual.

   The soul should not, then, be perplexed about forming an act which
   already subsists, and which, indeed, it cannot attempt to form without
   very great difficulty; it even finds that it is withdrawn from its
   proper state, under pretence of seeking that which is in reality
   acquired, seeing the habit is already formed, and it is confirmed in
   habitual conversion and habitual love. It is seeking one act by the
   help of many, instead of continuing attached to God by one simple act
   alone.

   We may remark, that at times we form with facility many distant yet
   simple acts; which shows that we have wandered, and that we re-enter
   our heart after having strayed from it; yet when we have re-entered, we
   should remain there in peace. We err, therefore, in supposing that we
   must not form acts; we form them continually: but let them be
   conformable to the degree of our spiritual advancement.

   4. The great difficulty with most spiritual people arises from their
   not clearly comprehending this matter. Now, some acts are transient and
   distinct, others are continued, and again, some are direct, and others
   reflective. All cannot form the first, neither are all in a state
   suited to form the others. The first are adapted to those who have
   strayed, and who require a distinct exertion, proportioned to the
   extent of their deviation; if the latter be inconsiderable, an act of
   the most simple kind is sufficient.

   5. By the continued act, I mean that whereby the soul is altogether
   turned toward God by a direct act, always subsisting, and which it does
   not renew unless it has been interrupted. The soul being thus turned,
   is in charity, and abides therein; "and he that dwelleth in love,
   dwelleth in God." (1 John iv. 16.) The soul then, is it were, exists
   and rests in the habitual act. It is, however, free from sloth; for
   there is still an uninterrupted act subsisting, which is a sweet
   sinking into the Deity, whose attraction becomes more and more
   powerful. Following this potent attraction, and dwelling in love and
   charity, the soul sinks continually deeper into that Love, maintaining
   an activity infinitely more powerful, vigorous, and effectual than that
   which served to accomplish its first return.

   6. Now the soul that is thus profoundly and vigorously active, being
   wholly given up to God, does not perceive this act, because it is
   direct and not reflective. This is the reason why some, not expressing
   themselves properly, say, that they make no acts; but it is a mistake,
   for they were never more truly or nobly active; they should say, that
   they did not distinguish their acts, and not that they did not act. I
   grant that they do not act in themselves; but they are drawn, and they
   follow the attraction. Love is the weight which sinks them. As one
   falling into the sea, would sink from one depth to another to all
   eternity, if the sea were infinite, so they, without perceiving their
   descent, drop with inconceivable swiftness into the lowest deeps.

   It is, then, improper to say that we do not make acts; all form acts,
   but the manner of their formation is not alike in all. The mistake
   arises from this, that all who know they should act, are desirous of
   acting distinguishably and perceptibly; but this cannot be: sensible
   acts are for beginners; there are others for those in a more advanced
   state. To stop in the former, which are weak and of little profit, is
   to declare ourselves of the latter; as to attempt the latter without
   having passed through the former, is a no less considerable error.

   7. "To everything there is a season" (Eccles. iii. 1): every state has
   its commencement, its progress, and its consummation, and it is an
   unhappy error to stop in the beginning. There is no art but what has
   its progress; at first, we labor with toil, but at last we reap the
   fruit of our industry.

   When the vessel is in port, the mariners are obliged to exert all their
   strength, that they may clear her thence, and put to sea; but they
   subsequently turn her with facility as they please. In like manner,
   while the soul remains in sin and the creature, many endeavors are
   requisite to effect its freedom; the cables which hold it must be
   loosed, and then by strong and vigorous efforts it gathers itself
   inward, pushes off gradually from the old port of Self, and, leaving
   that behind, proceeds to the interior, the haven so much desired.

   8. When the vessel is thus started, as she advances on the sea, she
   leaves the shore behind; and the farther she departs from the land, the
   less labor is requisite in moving her forward. At length she begins to
   get gently under sail, and now proceeds so swiftly in her course, that
   the oars, which are become useless, are laid aside. How is the pilot
   now employed? he is content with spreading the sails and holding the
   rudder.

   To spread the sails, is to lay ourselves before God in the prayer of
   simple exposition, to be moved by his Spirit; to hold the rudder, is to
   restrain our heart from wandering from the true course, recalling it
   gently, and guiding it steadily by the dictates of the Spirit of God,
   which gradually gains possession of the heart, just as the breeze by
   degrees fills the sails and impels the vessel. While the winds are
   fair, the pilot and the mariners rest from their labors. What progress
   do they not now secure, without the least fatigue! They make more way
   now in one hour, while they rest and leave the vessel to the wind, than
   they did in a length of time by all their former efforts; and even were
   they now to attempt using the oars, besides greatly fatiguing
   themselves, they would only retard the vessel by their useless
   exertions.

   This is our proper course interiorly, and a short time will advance us
   by the divine impulsion farther than many reiterated acts of
   self-exertion. Whoever will try this path, will find it the easiest in
   the world.

   9. If the wind be contrary and blow a storm, we must cast anchor in the
   sea, to hold the vessel. This anchor is simply trust in God and hope in
   his goodness, waiting patiently the calming of the tempest and the
   return of a favorable gale; thus did David: "I waited patiently for the
   Lord, and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry." (Ps. xl. 1.) We must
   therefore be resigned to the Spirit of God, giving ourselves up wholly
   to his divine guidance.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXIII.

   1,2. The barrenness of preaching, vice, error, heresies, and all sorts
   of evils arise from the fact that the people are not instructed in the
   prayer of the heart;

   3-5. Although the way is surer, easier, and fitter for the simple
   minded.

   6-8. Exhortation to pastors to set their flocks upon the practice of
   it, without employing them in studied forms and methodical devotion.

   If all who labored for the conversion of others sought to reach them by
   the heart, introducing them immediately into prayer and the interior
   life, numberless and permanent conversions would ensue. On the
   contrary, few and transient fruits must attend that labor which is
   confined to outward matters, such as burdening the disciple with a
   thousand precepts for external exercises, instead of leading the soul
   to Christ by the occupation of the heart in Him.

   If ministers were solicitous thus to instruct their parishioners,
   shepherds, while they watched their flocks, would have the spirit of
   the primitive Christians, and the husbandman at the plough maintain a
   blessed intercourse with his God; the manufacturer, while he exhausted
   his outward man with labor, would be renewed with inward strength;
   every species of vice would shortly disappear, and every parishioner
   become spiritually minded.

   2. O when once the heart is gained, how easily is all the rest
   corrected! this is why God, above all things, requires the heart. By
   this means alone, we may extirpate the dreadful vices which so prevail
   among the lower orders, such as drunkenness, blasphemy, lewdness,
   enmity and theft. Jesus Christ would reign everywhere in peace, and the
   face of the church would be renewed throughout.

   The decay of internal piety is unquestionably the source of the various
   errors that have appeared in the world; all would speedily be
   overthrown, were inward devotion re-established. Errors take possession
   of no soul, except such as are deficient in faith and prayer; and if,
   instead of engaging our wandering brethren in constant disputations, we
   would but teach them simply to believe, and diligently to pray, we
   should lead them sweetly to God.

   O how inexpressibly great is the loss sustained by mankind from the
   neglect of the interior life! And what an account will those have to
   render who are entrusted with the care of souls, and have not
   discovered and communicated to their flock this hidden treasure!

   3. Some excuse themselves by saying, that there is danger in this way,
   or that simple persons are incapable of comprehending the things of the
   Spirit. But the oracles of truth affirm the contrary: "The Lord loveth
   those who walk simply." (Prov. xii. 22, vulg.) But what danger can
   there be in walking in the only true way, which is Jesus Christ, giving
   ourselves up to Him, fixing our eye continually on Him, placing all our
   confidence in his grace, and tending with all the strength of our soul
   to his purest love?

   4. The simple ones, so far from being incapable of this perfection,
   are, by their docility, innocence, and humility, peculiarly qualified
   for its attainment; and, as they are not accustomed to reasoning, they
   are less tenacious of their own opinions. Even from their want of
   learning, they submit more freely to the teachings of the divine
   Spirit; whereas others, who are cramped and blinded by
   self-sufficiency, offer much greater resistance to the operations of
   grace.

   We are told in Scripture that "unto the simple, God giveth the
   understanding of his law" (Psalm cxviii. 130, vulg.): and we are also
   assured, that God loves to communicate with them: "The Lord careth for
   the simple; I was reduced to extremity and He saved me." (Psalm cxvi.
   6, cxv. 6, vulg.) Let spiritual fathers be careful how they prevent
   their little ones from coming to Christ; He himself said to his
   apostles, "Suffer little children to come unto me, for of such is the
   kingdom of heaven." (Matt. xix. 14.) It was the endeavor of the
   apostles to prevent children from going to our Lord, which occasioned
   this command.

   5. Man frequently applies a remedy to the outward body, whilst the
   disease lies at the heart. The cause of our being so unsuccessful in
   reforming mankind, especially those of the lower classes, is our
   beginning with external matters; all our labors in this field, do but
   produce such fruit as endures not; but if the key of the interior be
   first given, the exterior would be naturally and easily reformed.

   Now this is very easy. To teach man to seek God in his heart, to think
   of Him, to return to Him whenever he finds he has wandered from Him,
   and to do and suffer all things with a single eye to please Him, is
   leading the soul to the source of all grace, and causing it to find
   there everything necessary for sanctification.

   6. I therefore beseech you all, O ye that have the care of souls, to
   put them at once into this way, which is Jesus Christ; nay, it is He
   himself that conjures you, by all the blood he has shed for those
   entrusted to you. "Speak to the heart of Jerusalem!" (Isa. xl. 2,
   vulg.) O ye dispensers of his grace! preachers of his word! ministers
   of his sacraments! establish his kingdom!--and that it may indeed be
   established, make Him ruler over the heart! For as it is the heart
   alone that can oppose his sovereignty, it is by the subjection of the
   heart that his sovereignty is most highly honored: "Give glory to the
   holiness of God, and he shall become your sanctification." (Isa. viii.
   13, vulg.) Compose catechisms expressly to teach prayer, not by
   reasoning nor by method, for the simple are incapable of that; but to
   teach the prayer of the heart, not of the understanding; the prayer of
   God's Spirit, not of man's invention.

   7. Alas! by directing them to pray in elaborate forms, and to be
   curiously critical therein, you create their chief obstacles. The
   children have been led astray from the best of fathers, by your
   endeavoring to teach them too refined a language. Go, then, ye poor
   children, to your heavenly Father, speak to him in your natural
   language; rude and barbarous as it may be, it is not so to Him. A
   father is better pleased with an address which love and respect have
   made confused, because he sees that it proceeds from the heart, than he
   is by a dry and barren harangue, though never so elaborate. The simple
   and undisguised emotions of love are infinitely more expressive than
   all language, and all reasoning.

   8. Men have desired to love Love by formal rules, and have thus lost
   much of that love. O how unnecessary is it to teach an art of loving!
   The language of love is barbarous to him that does not love, but
   perfectly natural to him that does; and there is no better way to learn
   how to love God, than to love him. The most ignorant often become the
   most perfect, because they proceed with more cordiality and simplicity.
   The Spirit of God needs none of our arrangements; when it pleases Him,
   He turns shepherds into Prophets, and, so far from excluding any from
   the temple of prayer, he throws wide the gates that all may enter;
   while wisdom is directed to cry aloud in the highways, "Whoso is simple
   let him turn in hither" (Prov. ix. 4); and to the fools she saith,
   "Come eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled."
   (Prov. ix. 5.) And doth not Jesus Christ himself thank his Father for
   having "hid these things from the wise and prudent, and revealed them
   unto babes?" (Matt. xi. 25.)

  CHAPTER XXIV.

   On the passive way to Divine Union.

   It is impossible to attain Divine Union, solely by the way of
   meditation, or of the affections, or by any devotion, no matter how
   illuminated. There are many reasons for this, the chief of which are
   those which follow.

   1. According to Scripture, "no man shall see God and live." (Exod.
   xxxiii. 20.) Now all the exercises of discursive prayer, and even of
   active contemplation, regarded as an end, and not as a mere preparative
   to that which is passive, are still living exercises, by which we
   cannot see God; that is to say, be united with him. All that is of man
   and of his doing, be it never so noble, never so exalted, must first be
   destroyed.

   St. John relates that there was silence in heaven. (Rev. viii. 1.) Now
   heaven represents the ground and centre of the soul, wherein all must
   be hushed to silence when the majesty of God appears. All the efforts,
   nay, the very existence, of self, must be destroyed; because nothing is
   opposite to God, but self, and all the malignity of man is in
   self-appropriation, as the source of its evil nature; insomuch that the
   purity of a soul increases in proportion as it loses this self-hood;
   and that which was a fault while the soul lived in self-appropriation,
   is no longer such, after it has acquired purity and innocence, by
   departing from that self-hood, which caused the dissimilitude between
   it and God.

   2. To unite two things so opposite as the purity of God and the
   impurity of the creature, the simplicity of God and the multiplicity of
   man, much more is requisite than the efforts of the creature. Nothing
   less than an efficacious operation of the Almighty can ever accomplish
   this; for two things must have some relation or similarity before they
   can become one; as the impurity of dross cannot be united with the
   purity of gold.

   3. What, then, does God do? He sends his own Wisdom before Him, as fire
   shall be sent upon the earth, to destroy by its activity all that is
   impure; and as nothing can resist the power of that fire, but it
   consumes everything, so this Wisdom destroys all the impurities of the
   creature, in order to dispose it for divine union.

   The impurity which is so fatal to union consists in self-appropriation
   and activity. Self-appropriation; because it is the source and fountain
   of all that defilement which can never be allied to essential purity;
   as the rays of the sun may shine, indeed, upon mire, but can never be
   united with it. Activity; for God being in an infinite stillness, the
   soul, in order to be united to Him, must participate of his stillness,
   else the contrariety between stillness and activity would prevent
   assimilation.

   Therefore, the soul can never arrive at divine union but in the rest of
   its will; nor can it ever become one with God, but by being
   re-established in central rest and in the purity of its first creation.

   4. God purifies the soul by his Wisdom, as refiners do metals in the
   furnace. Gold cannot be purified but by fire, which gradually consumes
   all that is earthy and foreign, and separates it from the metal. It is
   not sufficient to fit it for use that the earthy part should be changed
   into gold; it must then be melted and dissolved by the force of fire,
   to separate from the mass every drossy or alien particle; and must be
   again and again cast into the furnace, until it has lost every trace of
   pollution, and every possibility of being farther purified.

   The goldsmith cannot now discover any adulterate mixture, because of
   its perfect purity and simplicity. The fire no longer touches it; and
   were it to remain an age in the furnace, its spotlessness would not be
   increased, nor its substance diminished. It is then fit for the most
   exquisite workmanship, and if, thereafter, this gold seem obscured or
   defiled, it is nothing more than an accidental impurity occasioned by
   the contact of some foreign body, and is only superficial; it is no
   hinderance to its employment, and is widely different from its former
   debasement, which was hidden in the ground of its nature, and, as it
   were, identified with it. Those, however, who are uninstructed,
   beholding the pure gold sullied by some external pollution, would be
   disposed to prefer an impure and gross metal, that appeared
   superficially bright and polished. [8]

   5. Farther, the pure and the impure gold are not mingled; before they
   can be united, they must be equally refined; the goldsmith cannot mix
   dross and gold. What will he do, then? He will purge out the dross with
   fire, so that the inferior may become as pure as the other, and then
   they may be united. This is what St. Paul means, when he declares that
   "the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is" (1 Cor. iii
   3); he adds, "If any man's work be burnt, he shall suffer loss, but he
   himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire." He here intimates, that
   there are works so degraded by impure mixtures, that though the mercy
   of God accepts them, yet they must pass through the fire, to be purged
   from self; and it is in this sense that God is said to examine and
   judge our righteousness, because that by the deeds of the law there
   shall no flesh be justified; but by the righteousness of God, which is
   by faith in Jesus Christ. (Rom. iii. 20, etc.)

   6. Thus we may see that the divine justice and wisdom, like a pitiless
   and devouring fire, must destroy all that is earthly, sensual, and
   carnal, and all self-activity, before the soul can be united to its
   God. Now, this can never be accomplished by the industry of the
   creature; on the contrary, he always submits to it with reluctance;
   because, as I have said, he is so enarmored of self, and so fearful of
   its destruction, that did not God act upon him powerfully and with
   authority, he would never consent.

   7. It may, perhaps, be objected here, that as God never robs man of his
   free will, he can always resist the divine operations; and that I
   therefore err in saying God acts absolutely, and without the consent of
   man.

   Let me, however, explain. By man's giving a passive consent, God,
   without usurpation, may assume full power and an entire guidance; for
   having, in the beginning of his conversion, made an unreserved
   surrender of himself to all that God wills of him or by him, he thereby
   gave an active consent to whatever God might afterwards require. But
   when God begins to burn, destroy, and purify, the soul does not
   perceive that these operations are intended for its good, but rather
   supposes the contrary; and, as the gold at first seems rather to
   blacken than brighten in the fire, so it conceives that its purity is
   lost; insomuch, that if an active and explicit consent were then
   required, the soul could scarcely give it, nay would often withhold it.
   All it does is to remain firm in its passive consent, enduring as
   patiently as possible all these divine operations, which it is neither
   able nor desirous to obstruct.

   8. In this manner, therefore, the soul is purified from all its
   self-originated, distinct, perceptible, and multiplied operations,
   which constitute a great dissimilitude between it and God; it is
   rendered by degrees conform, and then uniform; and the passive capacity
   of the creature is elevated, ennobled, and enlarged, though in a secret
   and hidden manner, hence called mystical; but in all these operations
   the soul must concur passively. It is true, indeed, that in the
   beginning its activity is requisite; from which, however, as the divine
   operations become stronger, it must gradually cease; yielding itself up
   to the impulse of the divine Spirit, till it is wholly absorbed in Him.
   But this is a process which lasts a long time.

   9. We do not, then, say, as some have supposed, that there is no need
   of activity; since, on the contrary, it is the gate; at which, however,
   we should not always tarry, since we ought to tend towards ultimate
   perfection, which is impracticable except the first helps are laid
   aside; for however necessary they may have been at the entrance of the
   road, they afterwards become greatly detrimental to those who adhere to
   them obstinately, preventing them from ever attaining the end. This
   made St. Paul say, "Forgetting those things which are behind, and
   reaching forth to those which are before, I press toward the mark, for
   the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus." (Phil. iii. 13.)

   Would you not say that he had lost his senses, who, having undertaken a
   journey, should fix his abode at the first inn, because he had been
   told that many travellers had come that way, that some had lodged
   there, and that the masters of the house dwelt there? All that we wish,
   then, is, that souls would press toward the end, taking the shortest
   and easiest road, and not stopping at the first stage. Let them follow
   the counsel and example of St. Paul, and suffer themselves to be led by
   the Spirit of God, (Rom. viii. 14,) which will infallibly conduct them
   to the end of their creation, the enjoyment of God.

   10. But while we confess that the enjoyment of God is the end for which
   alone we were created, and that every soul that does not attain divine
   union and the purity of its creation in this life, can only be saved as
   by fire, how strange it is, that we should dread and avoid the process;
   as if that could be the cause of evil and imperfection in the present
   life, which is to produce the perfection of glory in the life to come.

   11. None can be ignorant that God is the Supreme Good; that essential
   blessedness consists in union with Him; that the saints differ in
   glory, according as the union is more or less perfect; and that the
   soul cannot attain this union by the mere activity of its own powers,
   since God communicates Himself to the soul, in proportion as its
   passive capacity is great, noble and extensive. We can only be united
   to God in simplicity and passivity, and as this union is beatitude
   itself, the way that leads us in this passivity cannot be evil, but
   must be the most free from danger, and the best.

   12. This way is not dangerous. Would Jesus Christ have made this the
   most perfect and necessary of all ways, had it been so? No! all can
   travel it; and as all are called to happiness, all are likewise called
   to the enjoyment of God, both in this life and the next, for that alone
   is happiness. I say the enjoyment of God himself, and not of his gifts;
   these latter do not constitute essential beatitude, as they cannot
   fully content the soul; it is so noble and so great, that the most
   exalted gifts of God cannot make it happy, unless the Giver also
   bestows Himself. Now the whole desire of the Divine Being is to give
   Himself to every creature, according to the capacity with which it is
   endowed; and yet, alas! how reluctantly man suffers himself to be drawn
   to God! how fearful is he to prepare for divine union!

   13. Some say, that we must not place ourselves in this state. I grant
   it; but I say also, that no creature could ever do it; since it would
   not be possible for any, by all their own efforts, to unite themselves
   to God; it is He alone must do it. It is altogether idle, then, to
   exclaim against those who are self-united, as such a thing cannot be.

   They say again, that some may feign to have attained this state. None
   can any more feign this, than the wretch who is on the point of
   perishing with hunger can, for any length of time at least, feign to be
   full and satisfied. Some wish or word, some sigh or sign, will
   inevitably escape him, and betray that he is far from being satisfied.

   Since then none can attain this end by their own labor, we do not
   pretend to introduce any into it, but only to point out the way that
   leads to it: beseeching all not to become attached to the
   accommodations on the road, external practices, which must all be left
   behind when the signal is given. The experienced instructor knows this,
   points to the water of life, and lends his aid to obtain it. Would it
   not be an unjustifiable cruelty to show a spring to a thirsty man, then
   bind him so that he could not reach it, and suffer him to die of
   thirst?

   14. This is just what is done every day. Let us all agree in the way,
   as we all agree in the end, which is evident and incontrovertible. The
   way has its beginning, process, and termination; and the nearer we
   approach the consummation, the farther is the beginning behind us; it
   is only by leaving the one, that we can arrive at the other. You cannot
   get from the entrance to a distant place, without passing over the
   intermediate space, and, if the end be good, holy, and necessary, and
   the entrance also good, why should the necessary passage, the direct
   road leading from the one to the other, be evil?

   O the blindness of the greater part of mankind, who pride themselves on
   science and wisdom! How true is it, O my God, that thou hast hid these
   things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes!

   from pride, and the sight of men, who judge only from the outward
   appearance, to preserve them from corruption, and hide them in the
   secret of his presence. (Ps. xxxi. 20.) At the time I wrote, I had
   heard no mention of the perversions subsequently spoken of that those

  PART I.

ON THE WAY TO GOD
     __________________________________________________________________

    CHAPTER I.

   THE FIRST DEGREE: CONVERSION.

   1. The first degree is the return of the soul to God, when, being truly
   converted, it begins to subsist by means of grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

    CHAPTER II.

   THE SECOND DEGREE: THE EFFECTUAL TOUCH IN THE WILL.

   2. The soul then receives an effectual touch in the will, which invites
   it to recollection, and instructs it that God is within, and must be
   sought there; that He is present in the heart, and must be there
   enjoyed.

   3. This discovery, in the beginning, is the source of very great joy to
   the soul, as it is an intimation or pledge of happiness to come; in its
   very commencement, the road it is to pursue is opened and is shown to
   be that of the inward life. This knowledge is the more admirable, as it
   is the spring of all the felicity of the soul, and the solid foundation
   of interior progress; for those souls who tend toward God merely by the
   intellect, even though they should enjoy a somewhat spiritual
   contemplation, yet can never enter into intimate union, if they do not
   quit that path and enter this of the inward touch, where the whole
   working is in the will.

   4. Those who are led in this way, though conducted by a blind
   abandonment, yet experience a savory knowledge. They never walk by the
   light of the intellect, like the former, who receive distinct lights to
   guide them, and who, having a clear view of the road, never enter those
   impenetrable passes of the hidden will which are reserved for the
   latter. The former proceed upon the evidence furnished by their
   illuminations, assisted by their reason, and they do well; but the
   latter are destined to pursue blindly an unknown course, which,
   nevertheless, appears perfectly natural to them, although they seem
   obliged to feel their way. They go, however, with more certainty than
   the others, who are subject to be misled in their intellectual
   illuminations; but these are guided by a supreme Will which conducts
   them howsoever it will. And further, all the more immediate operations
   are performed in the centre of the soul, that is, in the three powers
   reduced to the unity of the will, where they are all absorbed,
   insensibly following the path prescribed for them by that touch to
   which we have before referred.

   5. These latter are they who pursue the way of Faith and absolute
   Abandonment. They have neither relish nor liberty for any other path;
   all else constrains and embarrasses them. They dwell in greater
   aridities than the others, for as there is nothing distinct to which
   their minds are attached, their thoughts often wander and have nothing
   to fix them. And as there are differences in souls, some having more
   sensible delights, and others being drier, so it is with those who are
   led by the will; the former sort have more relish and less solid
   acquirement, and should restrain their too eager disposition, and
   suffer their emotions to pass, even when they seem burning with love;
   the latter seem harder and more insensible, and their state appears
   altogether natural; nevertheless, there is a delicate something in the
   depth of the will, which serves to nourish them, and which is, as it
   were, the condensed essence of what the others experience in the
   intellect and in ardor of purpose.

   6. Still, as this support is exceedingly delicate, it frequently
   becomes imperceptible, and is hidden by the slightest thing. This gives
   rise to great suffering, especially in times of tribulation and
   temptation; for as the relish and support are delicate and concealed,
   the will partakes of the same character in a high degree, so that such
   souls have none of those strong wills. Their state is more indifferent
   and insensible, and their way more equable; but this does not hinder
   them from having as severe and even more serious trouble than others;
   for nothing being done in them by impulse, everything takes place, as
   it were, naturally, and their feeble, insensible, hidden wills cannot
   be found, to make head against their foes. Their fidelity, however,
   often excels that of the others. Notice the striking difference between
   Peter and John; one seems to be overflowing with extraordinary zeal,
   and falls away at the voice of a maid-servant; the other makes no
   external manifestation, and remains faithful unto the end.

   7. You will ask me, then, if these souls are urged on by no violent
   influence, but walk in blindness, do they do the will of God? They do,
   more truly, although they have no distinct assurance of it; His will is
   engraved in indelible characters on their very inmost recesses, so that
   they perform with a cold and languid, but firm and inviolable,
   abandonment, what the others accomplish by the drawings of an exquisite
   delight.

   8. Thus they go on under the influence of this divine touch, from one
   degree to another, by a faith more or less sensibly savory, and
   experience constant alternations of aridity and enjoyment of the
   presence of God, but ever finding that the enjoyment becomes
   continually deeper and less perceptible, and thus more delicate and
   interior. They discover, too, that in the midst of their aridity, and
   without any distinct illumination, they are not the less enlightened;
   for this state is luminous in itself, though dark to the soul that
   dwells in it. And so true is this, that they find themselves more
   acquainted with the truth; I mean that truth implanted in their
   interior, and which causes everything to yield to the Will of God. This
   divine Will becomes more familiar to them, and they are enabled, in
   their insipid way, to penetrate a thousand mysteries that never could
   have been discovered by the light of reason and knowledge. They are
   insensibly and gradually preparing, without being aware of it, for the
   states that are to follow.

   9. The trials of this state are alternations of dryness and facility.
   The former purified the attachment or tendency and natural relish that
   we have for the enjoyment of God. So that the whole of this degree is
   passed in these alternations of enjoyment, aridity, and facility,
   without any intermixture of temptations, except very transitory ones,
   or certain faults; for in every state, from the beginning onward, the
   faults of nature are much more liable to overtake us in times of
   aridity than in seasons of interior joy, when the unction of grace
   secures us from a thousand evils. In all the preceding states thus far,
   the soul is engaged in combatting its evil habits, and in endeavoring
   to overcome them by all sorts of painful self-denial.

   10. In the beginning, when God turned its look inward, he so influenced
   it against itself, that it was obliged to cut off all its enjoyments,
   even the most innocent, and to load itself with every kind of
   affliction. God gives no respite to some in this regard, until the life
   of Nature, that is, of the exterior senses as manifested in appetites,
   likes and dislikes, is wholly destroyed.

   11. This destruction of the appetites and repugnances of the outward
   senses, belongs to the second degree, which I have called the effectual
   touch in the will, and in which the highest and greatest virtue is
   practised, especially when the inward drawing is vigorous and the
   unction very savory. For there is no sort of contrivance that God does
   not discover to the soul, to enable it to conquer and overcome self in
   everything; so that at length, by this constant practice, accompanied
   by the gracious unction before referred to, the spirit gets the upper
   hand of nature, and the interior part comes under subjection without
   resistance. There is, then, no further trouble from this source, any
   more than if all external feeling had been taken away. This state is
   mistaken, by those who are but little enlightened, for a state of
   death; it is, indeed, the death of the senses, but there is yet a long
   way to that of the spirit.
     __________________________________________________________________

    CHAPTER III.

   THE THIRD DEGREE: PASSIVITY AND INTERIOR SACRIFICE.

   12. When we have for some time enjoyed the repose of a victory that has
   cost us so much trouble, and suppose ourselves forever relieved from an
   enemy whose whole power has been destroyed, we enter into the third
   degree, next in order to the other, which is a way of faith more or
   less savory, according to the state. We enter into a condition of
   alternate dryness and facility, as I have stated, and in this dryness,
   the soul perceives certain exterior weaknesses, natural defects, which,
   though slight, take it by surprise; it feels, too, that the strength it
   had received for the struggle, is dying away. This is caused by the
   loss of our active, inward force; for although the soul, in the second
   degree, imagines itself to be in silence before God, it is not entirely
   so. It does not speak, indeed, either in heart or by mouth, but it is
   in an active striving after God and constant outbreathing of love, so
   that, being the subject of the most powerful amorous activity, exerted
   by the Divine Love towards Himself, it is continually leaping, as it
   were, towards its object, and its activity is accompanied by a
   delightful and almost constant peace. As it is from this activity of
   love that we acquire the strength to overcome nature, it is then that
   we practice the greatest virtues and most severe mortifications.

   13. But just in proportion as this activity decays, and is lost in an
   amorous passivity, so does our strength of resistance sink and
   diminish, and, as this degree advances, and the soul becomes more and
   more passive, it becomes more and more powerless in combat. As God
   becomes strong within, so do we become weak. Some regard this
   impossibility of resistance as a great temptation, but they do not see
   that all our labor, aided and assisted by grace, can only accomplish
   the conquest of our outward senses, after which God takes gradual
   possession of our interior, and becomes Himself our purifier. And as He
   required all our watchfulness while He continued us in amorous
   activity, so He now requires all our fidelity to let Him work, while He
   begins to render Himself Lord by the subjection of the flesh to the
   Spirit.

   14. For it must be observed that all our outward perfection depends
   upon, and must follow the inward; so that when we are employed in
   active devotion, however simple, we are actively engaged against
   ourselves just as simply.

   15. The second degree accomplishes the destruction of the outward
   senses, the third, that of the inward, and this is brought about by
   means of this savory passivity. But as God is then working within, He
   seems to neglect the outward, and hence the reappearance of defects,
   though feebly and only in a time of aridity, which we thought extinct.

   16. The nearer we approach the termination of the third degree, the
   longer and more frequent are our aridities, and the greater our
   weakness. This is a purification which serves to destroy our internal
   feelings, as the amorous activity put an end to our external, and in
   each degree, there are alternations of dryness and enjoyment. The
   dryness serves as a purifier from its barrenness and weakness. As soon
   as we cease, from inability, to practice mortifications of our own
   fashioning, those of Providence take their place--the crosses which God
   dispenses according to our degree. These are not chosen by the soul;
   but the soul, under the interior guidance of God, receives such as He
   appoints.
     __________________________________________________________________

    CHAPTER IV.

   THE FOURTH DEGREE: NAKED FAITH.

   17. The fourth degree is naked faith; here we have nothing but inward
   and outward desolation; for the one always follows the other.

   18. Every degree has its beginning, progress, and consummation.

   19. All that has hitherto been granted and acquired with so much labor,
   is here gradually taken away.

   20. This degree is the longest, and only ends with total death, if the
   soul be willing to be so desolated as to die wholly to self. For there
   is an infinite number of souls that never pass the first degrees, and
   of those who reach the present state there are very few in whom its
   perfect work is accomplished.

   21. This desolation takes place in some with violence, and although
   they suffer more distress than others, yet they have less reason to
   complain, for the very severity of their affliction is a sort of
   consolation. There are others who experience only a feebleness and a
   kind of disgust for everything, which has the appearance of being a
   failure in duty and unwillingness to obey.

   22. We are first deprived of our voluntary works, and become unable to
   do what we did in the preceding degrees; and as this increases, we
   begin to feel a general inability in respect to everything, which,
   instead of diminishing, enlarges day by day. This weakness and
   inability gradually taking possession of us, we enter upon a condition
   in which we say: "For that which I do, I allow not; for what I would,
   that do I not; but what I hate, that do I." (Rom. vii. 15.)

   23. After being thus deprived of all things, both inward and outward,
   which are not essential, the work begins upon those which are; and in
   proportion as the virtuous life becoming a Christian, which we regarded
   with so much complacency, disappears, [9] we are likewise spoiled of a
   certain interior delight and substantial support. As this support
   becomes weaker and more subtile, the more perceptible becomes its loss.
   It is to be remarked, however, that there is no loss except to our own
   consciousness, as it still exists in the soul, but imperceptibly and
   without apparent action. If it were not hidden, the death and loss of
   self could not be accomplished. But it retires within, and shuts itself
   up so closely that the soul is not aware of its presence.

   24. Do you ask why this course is pursued? The whole object of the way
   thus far has been to cause the soul to pass from multiplicity to the
   distinct sensible without multiplicity; from the distinct sensible to
   the distinct insensible; then to the sensible indistinct, which is a
   general delight much less attractive than the other. It is vigorous in
   the beginning and introduces the soul into the perceived, which is a
   purer and less exquisite pleasure than the first; from the perceived,
   into faith sustained and working by love; passing in this way from the
   sensible to the spiritual, and from the spiritual to naked faith,
   which, causing us to be dead to all spiritual experiences, makes us die
   to ourselves and pass into God, that we may live henceforth from the
   life of God only.

   25. In the economy of grace, then, we begin with sensible things,
   continue with those which are spiritual, and end by leading the soul
   gradually into its centre, and uniting it with God.

   26. The more deeply this imperceptible support retires, the more does
   it knit the soul together, so that it cannot continue to multiply
   itself among a thousand things which it can no longer either affect or
   even perceive; and, entirely stripped, it is gradually obliged to
   desert even itself.

   27. It is stripped without mercy, then, equally and at the same time,
   of everything both within and without, and what is worst of all, is
   delivered over to temptations; and the more fully it is thus given up
   to temptation, the more completely is it deprived of strength to resist
   them from without; thus it is weakened still farther at the very time
   when it is subjected to more violent attacks, and finally its internal
   support is removed, which, while it served as a refuse and asylum,
   would be an evidence of the goodness of God, and of its faithfulness to
   itself.

   28. So you may see a man pursued by a powerful adversary; he fights,
   and defends himself as well as he is able, always contriving, however,
   to get nearer and nearer to a stronghold of safety; but the longer he
   fights the weaker he becomes, while the strength of his opponent is
   constantly increasing. What shall he do? He will gain the portal of the
   stronghold as adroitly as he can, for there he will find abundant aid.
   But, on reaching it, he sees that it is closed, and finds that, far
   from rendering him any assistance, the keepers have barricaded every
   loophole of refuge; he must fall into the hands of his powerful enemy,
   whom he recognizes, when, defenceless and in despair, he has given
   himself up, as his best and truest friend.

   29. Be sure, then, that this degree comprehends all these things; the
   privation of every good, the accumulation of all sorts of weaknesses,
   powerlessness of defence, no interior asylum; God himself often appears
   angry; and, to crown all, temptations.

   30. Willingly, I think I hear you say, provided I might be sure that my
   will was not in harmony with the malignity of nature and the weaknesses
   of the senses. Ah! you would be too happy; but that cannot be. In
   proportion as you become enfeebled and destitute of every operation and
   activity of love, however insignificant, the will, which was founded in
   that vigor of love, becoming weaker day by day, gradually disappears;
   and vanishing thus, it is certain that it takes no part in anything
   that is passing in the man, but is separate. But as it does not
   manifest itself anywhere, by any sign, it affords no assured support to
   the soul, but the contrary; for, no longer finding the will in an
   attitude of resistance, the soul believes that it is consenting to
   everything, and that it has joined in with the animal will, which is
   the only one perceptible.

   31. You will, perhaps, remind one that I have before stated that, in
   the first contest of amorous activity, nature and the senses had
   become, as it were, extinguished and subdued. It is true; but the
   spirit of self, by the very victories that grace had thus acquired for
   it, has become high-minded, more tenacious of what it esteems good, and
   still more indomitable. God, who is determined to subdue it, makes use
   for that purpose, of an apparent resurrection of that same nature which
   the soul supposed dead. But observe that He does not use nature until
   He has extracted its malignity, destroyed it and separated the superior
   will from that which rendered it violent and criminal. He extracts the
   venom of the viper, and then uses it as an antidote to the spirit.
   Whoever shall become acquainted with the admirable economy of grace and
   the wisdom of God in bringing man to a total sacrifice of self, will be
   filled with delight, and, insensible as he may be, will expire with
   love. The little traces of it which have been revealed to my heart,
   have often overwhelmed me with ecstasy and transport.

   32. Fidelity in this degree requires us to suffer spoliation to the
   whole extent of the designs of God, without being anxious about
   ourselves, sacrificing to God all our interests both for time and for
   eternity. Nothing must be made a pretext for reserving or retaining the
   slightest atom, for the least reservation is the cause of an
   irreparable loss, as it prevents our death, from being total. We must
   let God work his absolute pleasure, and suffer the winds and tempests
   to beat upon us from every quarter, submerged, as we may often be,
   beneath the tumultuous billows.

   33. A wonderful thing is here perceived; far from being estranged by
   our suffering and wretched state, it is then that God appears; and if
   any weakness has been apparent, He gives us some token of his immediate
   presence, as if to assure the soul for a moment, that He was with it in
   its tribulation. I say for a moment, for it is of no service
   subsequently, as a support, but is rather intended to point out the way
   and invite the soul to the further loss of self.

   34. These states are not continuous in their violence; there are
   remissions, which, while they afford space for taking breath, serve, at
   the same time, to render the subsequent trial more painful. For nature
   will make use of anything to sustain its life, as a drowning man will
   support himself in the water by clinging to the blade of a razor,
   without adverting to the pain it causes him, if there be nothing else
   within his reach.

   [9] It is not at all likely that any one who has attentively read thus
   far in this little work, will suppose that when the "virtuous life
   becoming a Christian" is said to disappear, it is meant that the person
   in this state is suffered to fall away into open sin. It simply
   disappears from his own eyes; to those of others, as well as to God, he
   exhibits in his degree, as ever, the Lord Jesus.--Editor.
     __________________________________________________________________

    CHAPTER V.

   THE FIFTH DEGREE: MYSTICAL DEATH.

   35. Attacked thus on all sides by so many enemies, without life and
   without support, we have no resource but to expire in the arms of Love.
   When death is complete, the most terrible states cause no further
   trouble. We do not recognize death from the fact of having passed
   through all these states, but by an absolute want of power to feel
   pain, to think of or care for self, and, by our indifference to
   remaining there forever, without manifesting the slightest sign of
   vitality. Life is evidenced by a will for or repugnance to something;
   but here, in this death of the soul, all things are alike. It remains
   dead and insensible to everything that concerns itself, and, let God
   reduce it to what extremity He will, feels no repugnance. It has no
   choice between being Angel or Demon, [10] because it has no longer any
   eyes for self. It is then that God has placed all its enemies beneath
   his footstool, and, reigning supreme, takes and possesses it the more
   fully, as it has the more completely deserted itself. But this takes
   place by degrees.

   36. There remains for a long time, even after death, a trace of the
   living heat, which is only gradually dissipated. All states effect
   somewhat towards cleansing the soul, but here the process is completed.

   37. We do not die spiritually, once for all, as we do naturally; it is
   accomplished gradually; we vibrate between life and death, being
   sometimes in one and sometimes in the other, until death has finally
   conquered life. And so it is in the resurrection; an alternate state of
   life and death, until life has finally overcome death.

   38. Not that the new life does not come suddenly. He who was dead,
   finds himself living, and can never afterward doubt that he was dead
   and is alive again; but it is not then established; it is rather a
   disposition toward living, then a settled state of life.

   39. The first life of grace began in the sensible, and sank continually
   inward toward the centre, until, having reduced the soul to unity, it
   caused it to expire in the arms of love; for all experience this death,
   but each by means peculiar to himself. But the life that is now
   communicated arises from within; it is, as it were, a living germ which
   has always existed there, though unobserved, and which demonstrates
   that the life of grace has never been wholly absent, however it may
   have been suffered to remain hidden. There it remained even in the
   midst of death; nor was it less death because life was concealed in it;
   as the silk-worm lies long dead in the chrysalis, but contains a germ
   of life that awakes it to a resurrection. This new life, then, buds in
   the centre, and grows from there; thence it gradually extends over all
   the faculties and senses, impregnating them with its own life and
   fecundity.

   40. The soul, endued with this vitality, experiences an infinite
   contentment; not in itself, but in God; and this especially when the
   life is well advanced.

   41. But, before entering upon the effects of this admirable life, let
   me say, that there are some who do not pass through these painful
   deaths; they only experience a mortal languor and fainting, which
   annihilate them, and cause them to die to all.

   42. Many spiritual persons have given the name of death, to the earlier
   purifications, which are, indeed, a death in relation to the life
   communicated, but not a total death. They result in an extinguishment
   of some one of the lives of nature, or of grace; but that is widely
   different from a general extinction of all life.

   43. Death has various names, according to our different manner of
   expression or conception. It is called a departure, that is, a
   separation from self in order that we may pass into God; a loss, total
   and entire, of the will of the creature, which causes the soul to be
   wanting to itself, that it may exist only in God. Now, as this will is
   in everything that subsists in the creature, however good and holy it
   may be, all these things must necessarily be destroyed, so far as they
   so subsist, and so far as the good will of man is in them, that the
   will of God alone may remain. Everything born of the will of the flesh
   and the will of man, must be destroyed. Then nothing but the will of
   God is left, which becomes the principle of the new life, and,
   gradually animating the old extinguished will, takes its place and
   changes it into faith.

   44. From the time that the soul expires mystically, it is separated
   generally from everything that would be an obstacle to its perfect
   union with God; but it is not, for all that, received into God. This
   causes it the most extreme suffering. You will object here, that, if it
   be wholly dead, it can no longer suffer. Let me explain.

   45. The soul is dead as soon as it is separated from self; but this
   death or mystic decease is not complete until it has passed into God.
   Until then, it suffers very greatly, but its suffering is general and
   indistinct, and proceeds solely from the fact that it is not yet
   established in its proper place.

   46. The suffering which precedes death, is caused by our repugnance to
   the means that are to produce it. This repugnance to the means whenever
   these means recur, or grow sharper; but in proportion as we die we
   become more and more insensible, and seem to harden under the blows,
   until at last death comes in truth through an entire cessation of all
   life. God has unrelentingly pursued our life into all its covert hiding
   places; for so malignant is it, that when hard pressed, it fortifies
   itself in its refuges, and makes use of the holiest and most reasonable
   pretexts for existence; but, being persecuted and followed into its
   last retreat, in a few souls (alas! how few!) it is obliged to abandon
   them altogether.

   47. No pain then remains arising from the means which have caused our
   death, and which are exactly the opposite to those which used to
   maintain our life; the more reasonable and holy the latter are in
   appearance, the more unreasonable and defiled is the look of the other.

   48. But after death--which is the cause of the soul's departure from
   self, that is, of its losing every self-appropriation whatever; for we
   never know how strongly we cling to objects until they are taken away,
   and he who thinks that he is attached to nothing, is frequently grandly
   mistaken, being bound to a thousand things, unknown to himself--after
   death, I repeat, the soul is entirely rid of self, but not at first
   received into God. There still exists a something, I know not exactly
   what, a form, a human remnant; but that also vanishes. It is a tarnish
   which is destroyed by a general, indistinct suffering, having no
   relation to the means of death, since they are passed away and
   completed; but it is an uneasiness arising from the fact of being
   turned out of self, without being received into its great Original. The
   soul loses all possession of self, without which it could never be
   united to God; but it is only gradually that it becomes fully possessed
   of Him by means of the new life, which is wholly divine.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [10] That is, from any selfish consideration of its own position; it
   only wills what God wills for it, and, if it were a supposable case,
   that God should desire it to be a devil, that would be the very thing
   it would crave above all others. If there should be any minds, however,
   so constituted as not to be able to take in a supposition apparently so
   contrary to the revealed order of God, as we perceive it in his word
   and works,--to such, it is an unprofitable nicety, which they may pass
   without concern.--Editor.
     __________________________________________________________________

    CHAPTER VI.

   UNION WITH GOD: BUT NOT YET RECOGNIZED.

   49. As soon as the soul has died in the embraces of the Lord, it is
   united to Him in truth and without any intermediate; for in losing
   everything, even its best possessions, it has lost the means and
   intermediates which dwelt in them; and even these greatest treasures
   themselves were but intermediates. It is, then, from that moment,
   united to God immediately, but it does not recognize it, nor does it
   enjoy the fruits of its union, until He animates it and becomes its
   vivifying principle. A bride fainting the the arms of her husband, is
   closely united to him, but she does not enjoy the blessedness of the
   union, and may even be unconscious of it; but when he has contemplated
   her for some time, fainting from excess of love, and recalls her to
   life by his tender caresses, then she perceives that she is in
   possession of him whom her soul loves, and that she is possessed by
   him.

  PART II.

  ON UNION WITH GOD.
     __________________________________________________________________

    CHAPTER I.

   THE RESURRECTION.

   50. The soul thus possessed of God, finds that He is so perfectly Lord
   over it, that it can no longer do anything but what He pleases and as
   He pleases; and this state goes on increasing. Its powerlessness is no
   longer painful but pleasant, because it is full of the life and power
   of the Divine Will.

   51. The dead soul is in union, but it does not enjoy the fruits of it
   until the moment of its resurrection, when God, causing it to pass into
   Him, gives it such pledges and assurances of the consummation of its
   divine marriage, that it can no longer doubt: for this immediate union
   is so spiritual, so refined, so divine, so intimate, that it is equally
   impossible for the soul to conceive or to doubt it. For we may observe
   that the whole way whereof we speak, is infinitely removed from any
   imagination; these souls are not in the least imaginative, having
   nothing in the intellect, and are perfectly protected from deceptions
   and illusions, as everything takes place within.

   52. During their passage through the way of faith, they had nothing
   distinct, far distinctness is entirely opposed to faith, and they could
   not enjoy anything of that sort, having only a certain generality as a
   foundation upon which everything was communicated to them. But it is
   far otherwise when the life becomes advanced in God; for though they
   have nothing distinct for themselves, they have for others, and their
   illumination for the use of others, though not always received by those
   for whom it was intended, is the more certain as it is more immediate,
   and as it were natural.

   53. When God raises a soul, that is to say, receives it into Himself,
   and the living germ, which is no other than the Life and Spirit of the
   Word, begins to appear, it constitutes the revelation in it of Jesus
   Christ, (Gal. i. 16,) who lives in us by the loss of the life of Adam
   subsisting in self.

   54. The soul is thus received into God, and is there gradually changed
   and transformed into Him, as food is transformed into the one who has
   partaken of it. All this takes place without any loss of its own
   individual existence, as has been elsewhere explained.

   55. When transformation begins, it is called annihilation, since in
   changing our form, we become annihilated as to our own, in order to
   take on His. This operation goes on constantly during life, changing
   the soul more and more into God, and conferring upon it a continually
   increasing participation in the divine qualities, making it
   unchangeable, immovable, etc. But He also renders it fruitful in, and
   not out of, Himself.

   56. This fruitfulness extends to certain persons whom God gives and
   attaches to the soul, communicating to it his Love, full of Charity.
   For the love of these divine souls for the persons thus bestowed upon
   them, while it is far removed from the natural feelings, is infinitely
   stronger than the love of parents for their children, and though it
   appears eager and precipitate, it is not so, because he, who exhibits
   it, merely follows the movement impressed upon him.

   57. To make this intelligible, we must know that God did not deprive
   the senses and faculties of their life, to leave them dead; for though
   there might be life in the centre of the soul, they would remain dead
   if that life were not also communicated to them. It increases by
   degrees, animates all the powers and senses which, until then, had
   remained barren and unfruitful, enlarges them in proportion to its
   communication, and renders them active, but with an activity derived
   and regulated from God, according to his own designs. Persons in a
   dying or dead condition, must not condemn the activity of such souls,
   for they could never have been put in divine motion if they had not
   passed through the most wonderful death. During the whole period of
   faith, the soul remains motionless; but after God has infused into it
   the divine activity, its sphere is vastly extended; but, great as it
   may be, it cannot execute a self-originated movement.
     __________________________________________________________________

    CHAPTER II.

   THE LIFE IN GOD.

   58. There is no more to be said here of degrees; that of glory being
   all that remains, every means being left behind, and the future
   consisting in our enjoying an infinite stretch of life, and that more
   and more abundantly. (John x. 10.) As God transforms the soul into
   Himself, his life is communicated to it more plentifully. The love of
   God for the creature is incomprehensible, and his assiduity
   inexplicable; some souls He pursues without intermission, prevents
   them, seats Himself at their door, and delights Himself in being with
   them and in loading them with the marks of his love. He impresses this
   chaste, pure, and tender love upon the heart. St. Paul and St. John the
   Evangelist, felt the most of this maternal affection. But to be as I
   have described it, it must be bestowed upon the soul in the state of
   grace of which I have just spoken; otherwise, such emotions are purely
   natural.

   59. The prayer of the state of faith is an absolute silence of all the
   powers of the soul, and a cessation of every working, however delicate,
   especially toward its termination. The soul in that state, perceiving
   no more prayer, and not being able to set apart fixed seasons for it,
   since all such exercises are taken away, is led to think that it has
   absolutely lost all kind of devotion. But when life returns, prayer
   returns with it, and accompanied by a marvellous facility; and as God
   takes possession of the senses and faculties, its devotion becomes
   sweet, gentle, and very spiritual, but always to God. Its former
   devotion caused it to sink within itself, that it might enjoy God, but
   that which it now has, draws it out of self, that it may be more and
   more lost and changed in God.

   60. This difference is quite remarkable, and can only be accomplished
   by experience. The soul is silent in the state of death, but its
   stillness is barren, and accompanied by a frantic rambling, which
   leaves no mark of silence save the impossibility of addressing God,
   either with the lips or the heart. But after the resurrection, its
   silence is fruitful and attended by an exceedingly pure and refined
   unction, which is deliciously diffused over the senses, but with such a
   purity, that it occasions no stay and contracts no taint.

   61. It is now impossible for the soul to take what it has not, or to
   put off what it has. It receives with passive willingness whatever
   impressions are made upon it. Its state, however overwhelming, would be
   free from suffering, if God, who moves it towards certain free things,
   gave them the necessary correspondence. But as their state will not
   bear it, it becomes necessary that what God wills they should have,
   should be communicated by means of suffering for them.

   62. It would be wrong for such persons to say that they do not wish
   these means; that they desire God only. He is anxious that they should
   die to a certain interior support of self, which causes them to say
   that they desire God only, and if they were to reject these means, they
   would withdraw themselves from the order of God, and arrest their
   progress. But, being given simply as means, though fruitful in grace
   and virtue, however secret and concealed, they finally disappear when
   the soul finds itself united with the means in God, and He communicates
   Himself directly. Then God withdraws the means, upon which he no longer
   impresses any movement in the direction of the person to whom they are
   attached; because it might then serve as a stay, its utility being at
   least recognized. The soul can then no longer have what it had, and
   remains in its first death in respect to them, though still very
   closely united.

   63. In this state of resurrection comes that ineffable silence, by
   which we not only subsist in God, but commune with Him, and which, in a
   soul thus dead to its own working, and general and fundamental
   self-appropriation, becomes a flux and reflux of divine communion, with
   nothing to sully its purity; for there is nothing to hinder it.

   64. The soul then becomes a partaker of the ineffable communion of the
   Trinity, where the Father of spirits imparts his spiritual fecundity,
   and makes it one spirit with Himself. Here it is that it communes with
   other souls, if they are sufficiently pure to receive its
   communications in silence, according to their degree and state; here,
   that the ineffable secrets are revealed, not by a momentary
   illumination, but in God himself, where they are all hid, the soul not
   possessing them for itself, nor being ignorant of them.

   65. Although I have said that the soul then has something distinct, yet
   it is not distinct in reference to itself, but to those with whom it
   communes; for what it says is said naturally and without attention, but
   seems extraordinary to the hearers, who, not finding the thing in
   themselves, notwithstanding it may be there, consider it as something
   distinct and wonderful, or perhaps fanatical. Souls that are still
   dwelling among the gifts, have distinct and momentary illuminations,
   but these latter have only a general illumination, without defined
   beams, which is God himself; whence they draw whatever they need, which
   is distinct whenever it is required by those with whom they are
   conversing, and without any of it remaining with themselves afterwards.
     __________________________________________________________________

    CHAPTER III.

   THE TRANSFORMATION.

   66. There are a thousand things that might be said about the inward and
   celestial life of the soul thus full of life in God, which He dearly
   cherishes for Himself, and which He covers externally with abasement,
   because He is a jealous God. But it would require a volume, and I have
   only to fulfill your request. God is the life and soul of this soul,
   which thus uninterruptedly lives in God, as a fish in the sea, in
   inexpressible happiness, though loaded with the sufferings which God
   lays upon it for others.

   67. It has become so simple, especially when its transformation is far
   advanced, that it goes its way perpetually without a thought for any
   creature or for itself. It has but one object, to do the will of God.
   But as it has to do with many of the creatures who cannot attain to
   this state, some of them cause it suffering by endeavoring to compel it
   to have a care for self, to take precautions, and so on, which it
   cannot do; and others by their want of correspondence to the Will of
   God.

   68. The crosses of such souls are the most severe, and God keeps them
   under the most abject humiliations and a very common and feeble
   exterior, though they are his delight. Then Jesus Christ communicates
   Himself in all his states, and the soul is clothed upon both with his
   inclinations and sufferings. It understands what man has cost Him, what
   his faithlessness has made Him suffer, what is the redemption of Jesus
   Christ, and how He has borne his children.

   69. The transformation is recognized by the want of distinction between
   God and the soul, it not being able any longer to separate itself from
   God; everything is equally God, because it has passed into its Original
   Source, is reunited to its ALL, and changed into Him. But it is enough
   for me to sketch the general outlines of what you desire to know;
   experience will teach you the rest, and having shown you what I ought
   to be to you, you may judge of what I am in our Lord.

   70. In proportion as its transformation is perfected, the soul finds a
   more extended quality in itself. Everything is expanded and dilated,
   God making it a partaker of his infinity; so that it often finds itself
   immense, and the whole earth appears but as a point in comparison with
   this wonderful breadth and extension. Whatever is in the order and will
   of God, expands it; everything else contracts it; and this contraction
   restrains it from passing out. As the will is the means of effecting
   the transformation, and the center is nothing else but all the
   faculties united in the will, the more the soul is transformed, the
   more its will is changed and passed into that of God, and the more God
   himself wills for the soul. The soul acts and works in this divine
   will, which is thus substituted for its own, so naturally, that it
   cannot tell whether the will of the soul is become the will of God, or
   the will of God become the will of the soul.

   71. God frequently exacts strange sacrifices from souls thus
   transformed in Him; but it costs them nothing, for they will sacrifice
   everything to Him without repugnance. The smaller sacrifices cost the
   most, and the greater ones the least, for they are not required until
   the soul is in a state to grant them without difficulty, to which it
   has a natural tendency. This is what is said of Jesus Christ on his
   coming into the world; "Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the
   book it is written of me; I delight to do thy will, O my God; yea, thy
   love is within my heart." (Psalm xi. 7,8.) As soon as Christ comes into
   any soul to become its living principle, He says the same thing of it;
   He becomes the eternal Priest who unceasingly fulfills within the soul
   his sacerdotal office. This is sublime indeed, and continues until the
   victim is carried to glory.

   72. God destines these souls for the assistance of others in the most
   tangled paths; for, having no longer any anxiety in regard to
   themselves, nor anything to lose, God can use them to bring others into
   the way of his pure, naked and assured will. Those who are still
   self-possessed, could not be used for this purpose; for, not having yet
   entered into a state where they follow the will of God blindly for
   themselves, but always mingling it with their own reasonings, and false
   wisdom, they are not by any means in a condition to withhold nothing in
   following it blindly for others. When I say withhold nothing, I mean of
   that which God desires in the present moment; for He frequently does
   not permit us to point out to a person all that hinders him, and what
   we see must come to pass in respect to him, except in general terms,
   because he cannot bear it. And though we may sometimes say hard things,
   as Christ did to the Capernaites, He nevertheless bestows a secret
   strength to bear it; at least He does so to the souls whom He has
   chosen solely for Himself; and this is the touchstone.

SPIRITUAL MAXIMS

   ATTRIBUTED TO

    PERE LA COMBE,

   AT ONE TIME SPIRITUAL DIRECTOR OF MADAME GUYON.

   "Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand
   doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the
   breasts."--Isa. xxviii. 9.

SPIRITUAL MAXIMS.

   1. To rob God of nothing; to refuse Him nothing; to require of Him
   nothing; this is great perfection. [11]

   2. In the commencement of the spiritual life, our hardest task is to
   bear with our neighbor; in its progress, with ourselves, and in its
   end, with God.

   3. He that regards self only with horror, is beginning to be the
   delight of God.

   4. The more we learn what humility is, the less we discover of it in
   ourselves.

   5. When we suffer aridity and desolation with equanimity, we testify
   our love to God; but when He visits us with the sweetness of his
   presence, He testifies his love to us.

   6. He that bears the privations of the gifts of God and the esteem of
   men, with an even soul, knows how to enjoy his Supreme Good beyond all
   time and above all means.

   7. Let no one ask a stronger mark of an excellent love to God, than
   that we are insensible to our own reputation.

   8. Would you exert all your powers to attain Divine Union? Use all your
   strength for the destruction of self.

   9. Be so much the enemy of self as you desire to be the friend of God.

   10. How are we directed in the law to love ourselves? In God with the
   same love that we bear to God; because as our true selves are in Him,
   our love must be there also.

   11. It is a rare gift to discover an indescribable something, which is
   above grace and nature; which is not God, but which suffers no
   intermediate between God and us. It is a pure and unmixed emanation of
   a created being who is immediately connected with the Uncreated
   Original, from whom he proceeds. It is a union of essence with essence,
   in which nothing that is neither can act the part of an intermediate.

   12. The ray of the creature is derived from the Sun of the Divinity; it
   cannot, however, be separated from it; and if its dependence upon its
   divine principle is essential, its union is not less so. O wonder! The
   creature which can only be by the power of God, cannot exist without
   Him, and the root of its being, that nothing can come between or cause
   the slightest separation. This is the common condition of all
   creatures; but it is only perceived by those whose purified faculties
   can trace the grandeur of their centre, and whose interior, freed from
   the defilement that covered it, begins to return to its origin.

   13. Faith and the cross are inseparable: the cross is the shrine of
   faith, and faith is the light of the cross.

   14. It is only by the death of self that the soul can enter into Divine
   Truth, and understand in part what is the light that shineth in
   darkness.

   15. The more the darkness of self-knowledge deepens about us, the more
   does the divine truth shine in the midst.

   16. Nothing less than a divine operation can empty us of the creature
   and of self, for whatever is natural tends constantly to fill us with
   the creature, and occupy us with ourselves. This emptiness without
   anything distinct, is, then, an excellent sign, though it exist
   surrounded by the deepest and, I may say, the most importunate
   temptations.

   17. God causes us to promise in time of peace what He exacts from us in
   time of war; He enables us to make our abandonments in joy, but He
   requires the fulfilment of them in the midst of much bitterness. It is
   well for thee, O Love! to exercise thy rights; suffer as we may, we
   will not return to self, or if we suffer because we have done so, the
   remedy for the evil is to devote ourselves afresh with an enlarged
   abandonment. Strange malady, the cure of which is only to be found in a
   worse! O Lord, cause me to do whatever Thou wilt, provided I do only
   thy will? [12]

   18. How hidden is the theology of Love! O Love, Thou sulliest to excess
   what Thou wouldst raise to the heights of purity! Thou profanest thine
   own sanctuary; there is not left one stone upon another that is not
   cast into the dirt. And what shall be the end? Thou knowest it from the
   beginning; it is worthy of so great a Workman that his work should be
   hidden, and that while He seems to destroy, He should accomplish it the
   most effectually.

   19. Ah Lord! who seest the secrets of the heart, Thou knowest if I yet
   expect anything from myself, or if there be anything which I would
   refuse to Thee!

   20. How rare is it to behold a soul in an absolute abandonment of
   selfish interests, that it may devote itself to the interests of God!

   21. The creature would willingly cease to be creature if it could
   become God; but where shall we find one willing that God should resume
   everything He has bestowed without receiving anything in return? I say
   everything, and everything without reserve, even to our own
   righteousness, which is dearer to man than his existence, and to our
   rest, by which we enjoy self and the gifts of God in self, and in which
   we place our happiness, without knowing it. Where shall we find an
   abandonment that is as comprehensive as the will of God, not only when
   accompanied by delights, illumination, and feeling, but under all
   circumstances and in fact? O it is a fruit of Paradise that can scarce
   be found upon the earth!

   22. God is infinitely more honored by the sacrifices of death than by
   those of life; by the latter we honor Him as a great Sovereign, but by
   the former, as God, losing all things for his glory. This is the reason
   why Jesus Christ made many more sacrifices of death than of life; and I
   suspect no one will gain all without having lost all.

   23. Reason should not undertake to comprehend the last destructions;
   they are ordained expressly to destroy our reason.

   24. God has means more efficient, more conducive to his own glory, and
   more edifying for souls, but they are less sanctifying. These great and
   dazzling gifts are very gratifying to nature, even when it seems to
   give way beneath their weight, and thus nourish its secret life; but
   distresses, continual dyings, and unprofitableness for any good,
   crucify the most vital parts of the soul, which are those which prevent
   the coming of the kingdom of God.

   25. In our solemn feasts, some strive to do something for Thee, O my
   God! and others, that Thou mayest do something for them; but neither of
   these is permitted to us. Love forbids the one and cannot suffer the
   other.

   26. It is harder to die to our virtues than to our vices; but the one
   is just as necessary as the other for perfect union. Our attachments
   are the stronger as they are more spiritual.

   27. What is a help to perfection at one time, is a hinderance at
   another; what formerly helped you in your way to God, will now prevent
   your reaching Him; the more wants we have, the further we are from God,
   and the nearer we approach him, the better can we dispense with
   everything that is not Himself. When we have come there, we use
   everything indifferently, and have no more need but of Him.

   28. Who can say to what extent the divine abandonment will carry the
   poor soul that is given up to it? or rather, to whom can we describe
   the extremity of sacrifice which God exacts from his simple victim? He
   raises him by degrees, and then plunges him into the abyss; he
   discovers new points to him day by day, and never ceases until he has
   sacrificed everything God wills, putting no other bounds to his
   abandonment than God does to his decrees. He even goes further,
   submitting to everything that God could do, or his sovereign will
   ordain. Then every selfish interest is given up; all is surrendered to
   the Author of All, and God reigns supreme over his nothingness.

   29. God gives us gifts, graces, and natural talents, not for our own
   use, but that we may render them to Him. He takes pleasure in giving
   and in taking them away, or in so disposing of us, that we cannot enjoy
   them; but their grand use is to be offered in a continual sacrifice to
   Him; and by this He is most glorified.

   30. Naked faith keeps us in ignorance, uncertainty, and oblivion of
   everything in reference to ourselves; says everything, excepts nothing,
   neither grace nor nature, virtue nor vice; it is the darkness
   concealing us wholly from ourselves, but revealing so much the more of
   the Divinity and the greatness of his works; an obscurity that gives us
   an admirable discernment of spirits, and dislodges the esteem and love
   of self from its most secret recesses. Pure love reigns underneath,
   notwithstanding; for how can a soul go about to consider its own
   interest, when it cannot so much as look at itself? Or, how could it be
   pleased to look at what it cannot see? It either sees nothing, or
   nothing but God, who is All and in all, and the more it is blinded to
   self, the more it beholds of Him.

   31. There are but few men who are led by their reason, most of them are
   fewer, indeed, who act from an illuminated faith, or from reason
   enlightened by faith; but shall we find a single one who admits no
   guide but a blind faith, which, though it leads him straight to God by
   the short road of abandonment, seems, nevertheless, to precipitate him
   into abysses from which he has no hope of ever escaping? There are,
   however, some such souls, who have noble trust enough to be
   blindfolded, and led they know not whither. Many are called, but few
   are willing to enter, and they who have most fully surrendered
   themselves to the sway of their senses, their passions, their reason,
   and the distinct illuminations of faith, are they who have the greatest
   difficulty in plunging into the gulf of the blindest and most naked
   faith; whereas the simple souls enter with ease. It is the same as with
   the shipwrecked; those who know how to swim, or who have perhaps seized
   a plank of the ship, struggle and contend for a long while before they
   drown; but those who cannot swim, and who have nothing to sustain them,
   are instantly submerged, and, sinking without a struggle beneath the
   surface, die and are delivered from their suffering.

   32. The spirituality of most spiritual persons is nothing but
   presumption. When the Divine Truth penetrates to their centre, it
   discovers many a theft from God in their course, and teaches them that
   the only way to secure themselves is by an abandonment without reserve
   to God, and submission to his guidance; for, whenever we endeavor to
   bring about our own perfection, or that of others, by our own efforts,
   the result is simply imperfection.

   33. The soul that is destined to have no other support but God himself,
   must pass through the strangest trials. How much agony and how many
   deaths must it suffer before losing the life of self! It will encounter
   no purgatory in the other world, but it will feel a terrible hell in
   this; a hell not only of pain--that would be a small matter--but also
   of temptations its own resistance to which it does not perceive; this
   is the cross of crosses, of all sufferings the most intolerable, of all
   deaths the most despairing.

   34. All consolation that does not come from God is but desolation; when
   the soul has learned to receive no comfort but in God only, it has
   passed beyond the reach of desolation.

   35. By the alternations of interior union and desertion, God sometimes
   makes us feel what He is, and sometimes gives us to perceive what we
   are. He does the latter to make us hate and die to ourselves, but the
   former to make us love Him, and to exalt us into union.

   36. It is in vain for man to endeavor to instruct man in those things
   which the Holy Spirit alone can teach.

   37. To take and receive all things not in ourselves, but in God, is the
   true and excellent way of dying to ourselves and living only to God.
   They who understand the practice of this, are beginning to live purely;
   but, outside of this, nature is always mingled with grace, and we rest
   in self instead of permitting ourselves no repose, except in the
   Supreme Good, who should be the center of every movement of the heart,
   as He is the final end of all the measures of love.

   38. Why should we complain that we have been stripped of the divine
   virtues, if we had not hidden them away as our own? Why should we
   complain of a loss, if we had no property in the thing lost? or why
   does deprivation give us so much pain, except because of the
   appropriation we had made of that which was taken away?

   39. When thou canst not find thyself, nor any good, then rejoice that
   all things are rendered unto God.

   40. O monster justly abhorred of God and man! after being humiliated in
   so many ways, I cannot become humble, and I am so pampered with pride,
   that when I most endeavor to be humble, I set about my own praises!

   41. Some saints have been sanctified by the easy and determined
   practice of all the virtues, but there are others who owe their
   sanctification to having endured with perfect resignation the privation
   of every virtue.

   42. If we do not go so far as to be stopped by nothing short of the
   power of God, we are not entirely free from presumption; and if our
   abandonment is bounded by anything short of the possible will of God,
   we are not yet disengaged from appropriation; and presumption and
   appropriation are impurities.

   43. I have never found any who prayed so well as those who had never
   been taught how. They who have no master in man, have one in the Holy
   Spirit.

   44. He who has a pure heart will never cease to pray; and he who will
   be constant in prayer, shall know what it is to have a pure heart.

   45. God is so great and so independent, that He can find means to
   glorify Himself even by sin.

   46. While our abandonment blesses or spares us, we shall find many to
   advise it; but let it bring us into trouble, and the most
   spiritually-minded will exclaim against it.

   47. It is easy enough to understand the course of such as go on from
   virtue to virtue, but who can comprehend the decrees that send some
   dashing from one precipice to another, and from abyss to abyss? or who
   shall bring aid and comfort to these hidden favorites of God, whom He
   gradually deprives of every stay, and who are reduced to an inability
   to know or help themselves as utter as their ignorance of what sustains
   them?

   48. Who can comprehend the extent of that supreme homage which is due
   to the will of God?

   49. Those who are abandoned are cast from one precipice to another, and
   from one abyss to another, as if they were lost.

   50. The harmlessness of the dove consists in not judging another; the
   wisdom of the serpent in distrusting ourselves.

   51. Self-seeking is the gate by which a soul departs from peace; and
   total abandonment to the will of God, that by which it returns.

   52. Alas! how hard it is to will only the will of God, and yet to
   believe that we do nothing but what is contrary to that will! to desire
   nothing so much as to do His will, and not even to know what it is! to
   be able to show it with great confidence to others, but not to find it
   for ourselves! When we are full of His will, and everywhere penetrated
   by it, we no longer know it. This is, indeed, a long and painful
   martyrdom, but one which will result in an unchangeable peace in this
   life, and an incomprehensible felicity in the next!

   53. He who has learned to seek nothing but the will of God, shall
   always find what he seeks.

   54. Which is the harder lot for a soul that has known and loved God,
   not to know whether it loves God, or whether God loves it?

   55. Which of the two would the perfect soul choose, if the choice were
   presented, to love God, or to be loved by Him?

   56. Tell me, what is that which is neither separated from God nor
   united to God, but which is inseparable from Him?

   57. What is the state of a soul which has neither power nor will? and
   what can it do, and not do?

   58. Who shall measure the extent of the abandonment of a soul that is
   no longer self-possessed in anything, and which has an absorbing sense
   of the supremity of the power and will of God?

   59. Who can take in the extent of the interior sacrifices of Jesus
   Christ, except him to whom He shall manifest them?

   60. How can they be delivered from the life of self, who are not
   willing to abandon all their possessions? How can they believe
   themselves despoiled of all, who possess the greatest treasure under
   heaven? Do not oblige me to name it, but judge, if you are enlightened;
   there is one of them which is less than the other, which is lost before
   it, but which those who must lose everything have the greatest trouble
   in parting with.

   THE END.
