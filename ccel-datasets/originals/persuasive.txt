  THE

                                    PREFACE

  TO THE

READER.

   Having been desired by my learned and pious Friend Mr. Edmund Elys, to
   draw up such a Persuasive as I now present the Reader with; finding my
   self well at leisure from other Business, and considering that it was
   suitable to my Profession, and present Condition; as being conducive to
   my preparation for that change, which the pains and infirmities I
   laboured under, seemed to threaten the near approach of, and might
   possibly be in some measure useful and beneficial to others: I was
   easily induced to comply with his Request, and to employ those
   Intervals I had of ease or remission of pain, in Meditations upon this
   Subject. I do not pretend to any thing new, or not delivered by others.
   Practical Divinity and Morality are such beaten Subjects, and have
   exercised the Wits and Pens of so many thinking Men, that there is
   nothing of this Nature can be said or written, which hath not already
   been so. But because not every Man, nay scarce any Man, hath read all
   that hath been written upon this, or any other Subject, something new
   to every Reader may perchance occur in this Writing: And yet if there
   does not, it may not be unprofitable to read the same things over
   again, as the Apostle in effect saith, Philip. iii. 1. But to do every
   Man right, I must acknowledge my self to have borrowed a good part of
   my Matter out of the Right Reverend Father in God, Dr. John Wilkins,
   late Lord Bishop of Chester, his Treatise of Natural Religion; wherein
   he hath in my judgment written so well concerning the Happiness that
   attends a Religious Life in this World, that little which is material
   can be added; and therefore I might well have spared my pains: Only
   this Tractate may possibly fall into the hands of some who never saw,
   nor would else have seen that; and recommend to them the reading of the
   whole.

CHAP. I.

   Some Mistakes about the Object of Happiness.

   HAPPINESS is that which all Men desire, and yet but few obtain: One
   reason is, because they mistaken their Object, placing it in something
   wherein it is not to be found; some in Bodily Pleasures, whom Aristotle
   calls apolaustikoi' others in Riches, whom the same Author calls
   chrematistikoi'. Others in Honour and Power, whom he denominates
   polistikoi' which things cannot make us happy: Because,

   1. They are not in our Power, but may forcibly be taken away from us;
   and should they continue with us during Life, at Death we must
   necessarily part with them.

   2. They make us not better, being common to good and bad. Now if bad
   Men may possess them, they cannot render us happy; because, as the Poet
   truly saith, Nemo malus felix, No wicked Man can be happy.

   3. They cannot satisfie the vast desires, or fill the Capacity of the
   Soul. The Soul of Man is spiritual and immortal, and therefore Bodily
   Pleasures, or Temporal Enjoyments are no way suitable to it, nor of
   answerable duration,

   My business in the following Discourse, shall be, to prove that a Holy
   Life is the only Happy Life, even in this World, advancing us to as
   high a degree of Happiness as we are capable of in this Imperfect
   State, and the only preparatory to a State of Eternal Felicity in the
   World to come.

   Before I proceed to prove this, it will be requisite to explain the
   Terms.

   1. What is meant by Holiness. 2. What by Happiness.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAP. II.

   What Holiness is.

   Holiness (as I have shewn in a former Treatise) is a Word of various
   significations in Scripture.

   When it is attributed to God, it signifies (as Dr. Owtram well [1]
   observes) either, 1. His transcendent Purity, or constant and immutable
   volition of that which is right and good, which the Apostle Peter
   proposes to our imitation, 1 Pet. 1. 14. As he that hath called you is
   holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation. Because it is
   written, Be ye holy, for I am holy, 1 John 3. 3. And every man that
   hath this hope in him, purifieth himself, as he is pure. Psal. 145. 17.
   The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works. Or,

   2. His glorious Majesty, which manifests it self in all Excellencies
   and Perfections, infinite Wisdom, infinite Power and Might, sovereign
   Dominion over all things; in respect whereof he is worthy of all Praise
   and Worship. So that Holy is often equivalent to great, and greatly to
   be feared, and had in reverence of all that draw nigh to him. In this
   sense God is often in Scripture called the Holy one of Israel; that is,
   that venerable Deity who is to be worshipped by a transcendent and
   incommunicable Worship, and his Name to be invoked with the most
   profound reverence and devotion.

   When Holiness is attributed to other things besides God, it signifies
   either, 1. A relative or outward Holiness, which results from a
   Separation from common and profane use, and application to a religious.
   God being the Sovereign Lord of all things, and himself holy, whatever
   is in a peculiar manner related to him, and appertains to his Worship
   and Service, whether Person or thing, hath a kind of relative Holiness,
   and upon account thereof an esteem and respect is due to it. Or, 2. An
   inherent or inward Holiness, or perfect conformity of heart and life to
   the Law and Will of God: Which kind of Holiness is proper only to
   rational Beings.

   You will say, If Holiness be such a perfect conformity, &c. then no Man
   ever was, is, or shall be holy in this Mortal Life. Doth not the
   Scripture tell us, 1 Kings 8. 46. There is no man that sinneth not? And
   Eccles. 7. 10. For there is not a just man upon earth that doth good,
   and sinneth not. Prov. 20. 9. Who can say, I have made my heart clean,
   I am pure from my sin? James 3. 2. In many things we offend all. 1 John
   1. 8. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive our selves, and the
   truth is not in us. And an Heathen Man could say, Nemo invenitur qui se
   possit absolvere; & innocentem quisque se dicit, respiciens testem, non
   conscientiam: There is no Man to be found that can absolve himself; and
   he that saith he is innocent, must respect a Witness, not his own
   Conscience.

   I answer, It is true, that perfect and sinless Holiness is not
   attainable by mortal Men in this present Life, and therefore God is
   pleased to accept of sincerity of Obedience instead of Perfection; and
   so we may define Holiness, so far as it is attainable in this imperfect
   state, to be a sincere and constant desire and endeavour to obey God in
   all his Commands. More than this, we cannot perform, and less than this
   God will not accept.

   1. This Obedience must be universal, without reserve or exception of
   any Command. Whatsoever we shall be convinced to be God's Will, and our
   Duty, we must set about it, and do it, be it never so uneasy to Flesh
   and Blood: Whatsoever we shall be convinced to be contrary thereto,
   though never so pleasing, never so customary to us, we must resolutely
   shun and avoid it. God must have the whole Heart; he admits no rival;
   Zeal for one Commandment will not compensate for the breach of another.
   We must with the Psalmist, Psal. 119. 128. Esteem all his precepts
   concerning all things to be right, and hate every false way.

   2. This desire and endeavour must be sincere and hearty; we must not
   harbour or entertain any secret inclination to any evil way. We must
   withdraw all degrees of Affection from whatever is sinful, or unlawful,
   or prohibited by God. The love or liking of any sin, or even wishing it
   were lawful, cannot consist with the love of God, which is the spring
   and source of sincere Obedience. Quis coram Deo innocens invenitur, qui
   vellet fieri quod vetatur, si subtrahas quod timetur. Ac per hoc in
   ipsa voluntate reus est, qui vult facere quod non licet fieri.
   Augustin. Epist. 121. Who can be found innocent before God, who wishes
   that might be done. which is forbidden; and would do it were it not for
   fear of Punishment, &c.

CHAP. III.

   What Happiness is.

   Happiness in general may be defined to be the secure and constant
   presence and enjoyment of whatsoever is really good, desireable and
   delightful; together with the absence of whatever is afflictive and
   tormenting.

   It is described by Boetius, to be Status omnium honorum aggregatione
   perfectus: An Estate perfect by the confluence of all good things. And
   by Cicero, Secretis malis omnibus cumulatum bonorum possessio: An
   accumulated possession of good things, all evil things being withdrawn.
   The holy Psalmist himself makes the happiness of the Beatifick Vision
   to consist in fulness of Joy, and Eternal Pleasures, Psal. 17. ult. In
   thy presence there is fulness of joy, and at thy right hand there are
   pleasures for evermore. And by our Blessed Saviour the happiness of
   Heaven is called the joy of the Lord, Matth. 25. 21 and 23.

   Happiness is usually distinguished into Objective and Formal.

   Objective Happiness is that Object or thing which renders us happy.

   Formal Happiness is the union with, or enjoyment of that Object.

   The supreme Objective Happiness of Man, his chief good, or last end, is
   the ever blessed Deity.

   His Formal Happiness is the Enjoyment of this Object, which consists in
   the knowledge and love of God, and that joy an delectation which
   naturally and necessarily flows therefrom; John 17. 3. And this is Life
   eternal, that they may know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ,
   whom thou hast sent.

   You will say, If the happiness of Man consists in the love of God, how
   can holiness of life be said to render a Man happy?

   I answer, Because holiness or obedience to the Commandments of God, is
   in effect the same thing with the love of God. By the Apostle John it
   is made to be the very same, 1 John 5. 3. For this is the love of God,
   that we keep his Commandments. And Galat. 5. 3. Love is said to be the
   fulfilling of the Law. Dr. Hammond in his Note upon John 14. 15.
   observes, that the Notion of loving God in Scripture, but especially in
   the New Testament, seems most fitly to be taken from one most eminent
   Act and Expression of Love amongst all Men; that is, doing those things
   which are most grateful and acceptable to the beloved. Now our only way
   of doing things grateful to God, is our performing what he commands;
   and therefore it is consequent, that our obedience to the Will or
   Commands of God, in the highest and most perfect manner, is styled the
   loving of him; being indeed the prime, if not only way of demonstrating
   our love to him, John 14. 21. He that hath my Commandments, and keepeth
   them, he it is that loveth me: and ver. 23. If any man love me, he will
   keep my word: and 1 John 2. 5. He that keeps his word, in him is the
   love of God made perfect, &c. Another Notion there is of the Love of
   God, viz. a desire of union and near conjunction with him; but this is
   but seldom lookt upon in the Scriptures. Thus far Dr. Hammond.

   Love is by some Divines distinguished into Appreciative and Sensible,
   or rather Passionate.

   Appreciative Love is such an affection whereby we prize or value any
   one Object above another.

   Sensible or Passionate Love is that which hath a greater influence upon
   the Body, and doth more strongly move and affect it.

   Our Love to God in this state is of the first kind, such an affection
   or disposition of Soul, whereby we prize him above all things; so that
   neither Father nor Mother, nor Wife, nor Child, though they may more
   sensibly and passionately affect us, are so much esteemed by us, we can
   be content to part with them when God pleases, and quietly to submit to
   his Will. No Worldly advantage, much less the gratifying any Lust, can
   prevail with us to break any one of his Commandments. Yet ought we not
   to rest contented with this degree of love to God, but to labour after
   that which is more ardent and passionate; else how can we satisfie our
   selves in a Time of Temptation, that our Obedience to God's Commands
   proceeds not rather from a Principle of Fear, or Self-love, than of
   love to God.

CHAP. IV.

   Of the Division of Happiness.

   Though the supreme and chief Happiness of Man consists in the knowledge
   and love of God, yet there are other things which contribute to the
   completion of it, especially in this World, viz. Those which tend to
   the making our present condition easy and comfortable to us; such as
   Health, Wealth, Friends, Reputation; the contrary whereto; as Sickness,
   Bodily-pain, Hunger and Thirst, Disgrace, &c. would render it grievous
   and unpleasant. The former of these are eagerly pursu'd by a great part
   of Mankind, as their chief good and happiness. Could we therefore
   demonstrate (and I think it not difficult to do) that Holiness or
   obedience to God's Commands, is the most effectual means to procure and
   secure these outward Enjoyments to us, so far as there is any good in
   them; I think we should need no other consideration to recommend a Holy
   Life and Conversation to all sorts and conditions of Men.

   Which that we may do the more clearly and satisfactorily, it will be
   convenient to make a division of Happiness according to the several
   states of Man, and his several parts, and the particular ingredients,
   which make up the happiness of each part, in each state.

   And because I cannot think of a better, I shall make use of that of Dr.
   Wilkins, late Lord Bishop of Chester, in his Treatise of Natural
   Religion.

   The Happiness then of Man is either that of this present Estate, which
   determines at Death; or that of a future Estate, which commences at
   Death, and continues to all Eternity.

   The Happiness of this present Estate may be divided into, 1. External,
   or, that of the Outward Man: Or, 2. Internal, or that of the Inner Man.

   External Happiness consists principally in, 1. Health, 2. Safety,
   Liberty and Quiet. 3. Riches. 4. Pleasures. 5. Honour and Reputation.
   6. Friends. Under which Name I comprehend also Natural Relations; As
   Wife, and Children, and Parents, who are usually called so in common
   speech; as when we say, Such a Man hath good Friends, or his Friends
   are well to live.

   Internal Happiness consists in the knowledge and love of God,
   manifested by our obedience to his Commands; the improvement of all our
   Faculties; inward peace of Conscience, Joy and Tranquillity of Mind.

   The Happiness of the future Estate, is the clear Vision of God,
   likeness to him, and union with him by perfect love: 1 John 3. 2. We
   shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. This differs chiefly
   in degree from the precedent.

   Before I run over these Heads in particular, I shall premise two things
   in general.

   First, That keeping of God's Commandments is every way for the good,
   benefit and advantage of the whole world, and Mankind in general. Sin,
   1 which is the breach of God's Law, is the only procuring and
   productive cause of all the Evils and Miseries, Troubles and Distresses
   that are in the world. Did Men generally obey God's Laws, the whole
   Earth, which is now for the most part an Akeldama, or Field of Blood,
   would be turn'd into a very Paradise, into a Heaven: Men would then
   beat their Swords into Plowshares, and their Spears into Pruning-hooks.
   Men who now are Wolves and Tygers one to another, who bite and devour
   one another, would then be a protection and defence, and mutual help
   one to another. Whence come wars and fightings among you, (saith the
   Apostle James) come they not hence, even of your lusts, which war in
   your members? Running over all the Commandments of God, I might easily
   deduce and demonstrate in particular, that each of them conduces to the
   publick good and benefit.

   Secondly, The Commandments of God are not grievous or uneasy; his Law
   is holy, and just, and good, his Precepts equal and reasonable; nay, so
   suitable and agreeable to the Nature and Reason of Man, that I will be
   bold to say, They ought upon their own account to be observed and
   obeyed by us, were there no Heaven to reward our Obedience, no Hell to
   punish our Disobedience.

   This is the foundation of that Stoical Doctrine, That Virtue is its own
   Reward, and that Happiness consists in the very doing of Virtuous
   Actions: And therefore a wise Man is satisfied with the Conscience of
   well-doing, and will not do any dishonest or wicked thing, to avoid any
   Suffering or Torment whatsoever. The reason is, because God hath
   imprinted in our Nature an aversation from Vice, and dislike of it; so
   that we cannot but condemn our selves for doing any thing that is
   dishonest or unjust: Se judice nemo nocens absolvitur: No nocent person
   is absolved, himself being Judge. Nor can any terrour or torment acquit
   us from blame, if to avoid it we do any vile or dishonest action. But
   on the contrary, if we resolutely stick to that which is good, whatever
   we suffer for it, we satisfy our own Consciences, and rejoice in having
   done so, and gain the approbation and applause of all Men. The Evil of
   Sin is greater, and more to be avoided than the Evil of Pain or
   Suffering, tho' that be a great Evil too; and that man be far from
   being happy, who labours under extreme Bodily Pain, especially if
   without hope of deliverance: Such a Man's very Being would be a Burthen
   to him; it being a true saying, Præftat non esse quàm miserum esse:
   Better not to be, than to be miserable.

   But our gracious God hath not put us off with such a Reward as this;
   (which notwithstanding the Apostle saith of the Christians of his time,
   That if in this life only they had hope, they would be of all men the
   most miserable:) but hath promised to recompense our Obedience with
   Eternal Life and Happiness; and particularly our Sufferings for his
   Cause, and for Righteousness sake, with a far more exceeding and
   eternal weight of glory. And for our encouragement hath permitted us to
   have a respect to this recompence of reward; as Moses, that Man of God,
   and others of his Servants mentioned Heb. 11. had.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAP. V.

   Of Health.

   Health is a Blessing so necessary to our Well-being in this World, that
   without it we cannot enjoy any thing else, no not our own selves: And
   therefore the common salutation among us at every meeting of Neighbour
   or Friends is this, How do you? that is, are you in Health or no? And
   the Answer Well, or Ill; that is, in health or not: As if Health were
   the chief or only good thing worth the enquiring after, in the presence
   or enjoyment whereof we could not be miserable whatever else we wanted:
   Nor in the absence, happy or well, whatever besides we possessed.
   Indeed there is no taste or relish, no comfort or delight in any
   worldly good, where health is wanting; and therefore it is by all Men
   highly valued and purchased at the dearest rate, as Bishop Wilkins well
   observes.

   Health is such a just temper and constitution of all the parts of the
   Body, both solid and fluid, as may inable the several Members and
   Faculties duly to perform their natural Functions, from whence proceeds
   not only an indolency or freedom from Pain and Sickness, but also vigor
   and activity, alacrity and light heartedness, a pleasant and delicious
   sympathy in the Soul. To this head I refer freedom from Bodily Pain,
   the extremity whereof is altogether inconsistent with Happiness: St.
   Augustine confesses, That he was compelled to consent to Cornelius
   Celsus, who affirmed Bodily Pain to be the greatest Evil. Neither
   (saith he) did his Reason seem to me absurd, viz. That Man being
   compounded of two parts, Soul and Body, of which the first is the
   better, the latter the worser; the greatest good must be the best thing
   belonging to the better part; that is, Wisdom: And the greatest Evil
   the worst thing belonging to the worser part; that is, Pain. Whether
   this Reason be solid and conclusive, let others judge; but I fully
   agree with him in the Assertion, That of all Evils we are sensible of
   in this World, Bodily Pain is the sorest; It drowning, as I may so say,
   and taking away the sense of all other Evils, and wholly possessing the
   Soul. It is such an afflictive and tormenting Passion, such a Vultur or
   Tyger, tearing and gnawing upon the Soul, so abhorrent to Humane
   Nature, that an excessive degree of it must needs make a Man miserable
   and unhappy; unless we can reconcile and unite extremes, the greatest
   Evil that Man is capable of suffering, with the greatest good he can
   enjoy. Hence the Torments of Hell are every where in Scripture set
   forth by consuming Fire, unquenchable Fire, everlasting Burnings; and
   Hell it self called a Lake of Fire, a Lake which burns with Fire and
   Brimstone; because Fire produceth the greatest Bodily Pain; than which
   nothing is more terrible to Humane Nature, and more likely to affright
   Men from Sin. On the contrary, St. John in his Revelation considering
   the absolute inconsistency of Pain and Happiness, tells us, That in the
   New Jerusalem there shall be no sorrow, nor any more Pain.

   There is indeed a degree of Bodily Pain, which may be said to be kat'
   a'nthropon, not exceeding the measure of Man's Patience; and there is a
   degree which we are not able to bear, which takes up the whole Mind,
   not suffering it to divert its thoughts one Minute to any other Object.

   Away then with the foolish vaunts of the proud Stoicks, who boast that
   their Wise Man is happy in Phalaris his Bull; whom [2] St. Augustine
   thus smartly and ingeniously checks and confutes, If Life may be happy
   in extreme bodily torment, why do they advise a man afflicted with the
   most grievous pains to depart out of it? Why does not their Wiseman
   rather continue in it, that he may enjoy the happiness of it? Is a
   happy life to be forsaken and fled from? But if such a Life be really
   miserable, what else but pride hinders them from confessing it to be
   so.

   You will say, Did not the holy Martyrs endure the greatest Bodily
   Torments with invincible patience, yea some of them with joy and
   exultation.

   I answer, 'Tis true indeed they did so; but then I suppose, that as
   their Temptations and Sufferings were extraordinary, so they were
   extraordinarily supported under them; and that God (as the Apostle
   saith) did not suffer them to be tempted above what he enabled them to
   bear. It seems to me most likely, that he did quite take away, or very
   much mitigate the sense of pain; possibly by obstructing those Nerves
   which convey that motion to the Brain, which excites such a sense, or
   how else it seemed best to his Divine Wisdom.

   I proceed now to prove, that this. Blessing is the portion of those who
   lead a godly Life, who keep God's Commandments, and abide in his Love:
   And that, 1. From the Promises of God: 2. From the natural consequence
   of several Virtues commanded by him. Such are, 1. Temperance and
   Sobriety, 2. Labor and Industry. 3. A due government and moderation of
   our Passions.

   1. Health and Long Life, (I put them together, the one for the most
   part being the consequent of the other) are in Scripture promised as
   rewards to the obedience of the Commandments of God. Exod. 23. 25. Thou
   shalt serve the Lord thy God--And I will take away Sickness from the
   midst of thee. Deut. 7. 15. And the Lord will take away from thee all
   Sickness, and will put none of the evil Diseases of Egypt (which thou
   knowest) upon thee. Prov. 3. 7, 8. Fear the Lord and depart from evil:
   It shall be health to thy Navel, and Marrow to thy Bones. Prov. 3. 16.
   It is said of Wisdom, That length of days are in her right hand. Psal.
   34. 12. What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that
   he may see good? Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips that thou
   speak no guile. Depart from evil, and do good, &c. repeated 1 Pet. 3.
   10. On the other side Sickness and grievous Diseases and premature
   Death are often threatned as Punishments of Sin and Disobedience: Deut.
   28. 60, 61. If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this Law,
   &c. He will bring upon thee all the evil Diseases of Egypt, &c. also
   every Sickness, and every Plague which is not written in this Law.
   Prov. 2. 22. The wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the
   transgressors shall be rooted out of it. Prov. 11. 19. As righteousness
   tendeth to life, so he that pursueth evil, pursueth it to his own
   Death.

   2. Health and Long Life are the natural consequents of some Virtues
   commanded by God: As,

   1. Temperance and Sobriety in the use of Meats and Drinks: That this is
   a most effectual means to preserve Health, I appeal to the general
   consent of Physicians, who are the most competent Judges in this Cafe,
   all unanimously prescribing a moderate Diet, not only as a principal
   means to continue Health, but also to cure many Diseases, Hence
   Hippocrates saith, 6 Epid. Sect. 4. Aph. 10. Askesis ugie`s akoresi'e
   trophes, aokni'e po'non: The exercise of preferring health is, not to
   eat to satiety, not to be slothful in labor.

   That a very spare and ascetick Diet conduces much to Health and long
   Life, may be confirmed by many eminent Examples: St. Paul, the first
   Hermite (as St. Jerome in his Life reports) arrived to the Age of 115
   Years, an hundred whereof he spent in the Wilderness, sustaining
   himself daily the first forty with a few Dates, and a draught of Water;
   and when Dates failed, with half a Loaf of Bread, which a Raven brought
   him. St. Anthony (as Athanasius witnesseth) lived 105 Years, of which
   he spent 90 in the Desert, supporting his Body with Bread and Water
   only, to which in his extreme old Age he added a few Sallet Herbs.
   Arsenius, the Emperor Arcadius his Tutor, lived 120 Years, fifty five
   whereof he spent in the Wilderness, in wonderful abstinence. Not long
   before our Times, Ludovicus Cornarus, a Venetian Nobleman, when he had
   lived unhealthfully to the 35th Year of his Age, being frequently
   afflicted with divers Diseases, at last by the advice of a certain
   Physician, he used a restrained Diet, whereby alone he gradually cured
   them all; by little and little diminishing the quantity of his Meat and
   Drink, till he descended to fourteen Ounces of Meat, reckoning Bread,
   Flesh, Eggs, and other Edibles, and sixteen Ounces of Drink daily;
   persevering in which Regimen, he produced his Life healthful, vigorous,
   and free from Diseases above 100 Years, as himself witnesseth in a Book
   he put forth, entituled, The benefits and advantages of a sober Life.
   Whence we may collect (saith Riverius) out of whose Institutions I
   borrow'd these Instances, That a spare Diet doth very much conduce, not
   only to the continuance of Health, but also to the curing of
   contumacious Diseases, and of long continuance. For though Natural Heat
   having suddenly concocted the small quantity of Food taken in, is
   afterwards employed about the superfluous Humours, digesting,
   dissipating, and by little and little expelling them through the
   several Emunctories of the Body, till at last the Body becomes pure and
   free from the Causes and Seeds of all Diseases.

   Moreover, It is very remarkable, which the same Riverius adds, That if
   an exact Diet cannot quite take away some chronical and incurable
   Diseases, yet doth it much alleviate them, and render them more
   tolerable, so that the sick Persons may live a long time under them. So
   we see not a few daily, who produce their Lives many Years under an
   Ulcer of the Lungs, a Scirrhus of the Liver or Spleen, a Stone in the
   Reins or Bladder. Aristotle in his Problems witnesseth, That there was
   a certain Philosopher in his time, named Herodicus, who though he
   laboured under a Consumption, yet by a strict observation of Diet,
   attained to 100 Years.

   The. Benefits of Temperance will best appear from the Mischiefs and
   Inconveniencies the contrary Vices of Intemperance and Excess bring
   upon us; especially as to the impairing and ruining of our Health,
   which is a natural consequent thereof. For the Stomach by immoderate
   repletion being overcharged or clog'd, with more than it can digest,
   must needs flubber over its work, as a Mill that is fed too fast, and
   instead of a well concocted and benign Chyle, transmit to the other
   Vessels a Crude and impure Juice, full of many heterogeneous and
   noxious Particles or Qualities, that breed an universal Distemper and
   Dyscrasie in the Body, and lay the foundation of many future diseases;
   an error in the first concoction (as the old Physicians well observe)
   being seldom or never corrected in the subsequent.

   That most diseases owe their original to excess in eating and drinking,
   appears in that they are cured by blood-letting, purging vomiting,
   sweating, and other Evacuations, whereby the abundance of superfluous
   Humours is exhausted. It is a Proverbial Saying, Plures occidit gula
   quàm gladius: The Throat hath slain more than the Sword. Rioting and
   drunkenness offer such violence to Nature, do so inflame the Blood, the
   vehicle of Life, waste and dissipate the Spirits, that Men guilty of
   them seldom live out half their days: Insomuch that (as Bishop Wilkins
   well observes) no Man of ordinary prudence, who is to take a Lease for
   Lives, will be content (if he can well avoid it) to choose one whom he
   knows to be vicious and intemperate.

   It may be objected, that some who daily exceed all bounds in eating and
   drinking, feeding themselves (as the Apostle saith) without fear, do
   yet live to an extreme old Age.

   I answer, That there are but very few of these, and those of exceeding
   firm strength of Parts and temperament of Body; who yet if they live
   temperately, might holdout much longer, and would be more fit for all
   the Actions of the Mind and Understanding: For (saith Riverius) Those
   who live intemperately, must needs be fill'd with many noxious Humours,
   and often troubled with Sickness; neither can they, without prejudice
   to their Health, be long intent on the difficult Functions of the Mind;
   both because in them the whole force of Nature, and of the Spirits is
   spent in the concoction of Meats; from which, if by any contention of
   mind, they be violently withdrawn, concoction will be depraved, and
   many crudities ensue; and also because they have need of frequent
   Bodily Exercise to dissipate, or Medicaments to purge out their ill
   Humours they daily accumulate. So that though such men seem to live
   long in the Body, yet in effect they live but little to their mind, and
   to those ends for which Life was given; being but a little while fit
   for the Functions of the Soul, the greatest part of their time being
   necessarily bestowed on the Service of the Body.

   And yet even in these the Body is not made of Steel or Adamant, the
   strength of their Natural Temper cannot always resist and hold out
   against the rude shocks and batteries of so many excesses and
   debauches, but must needs by degrees be weakened and impaired, and. at
   last utterly marred and subverted.

   I might add further in commendation of this Grace of Temperance, that
   it conduces much to the preservation of the External form, and
   comeliness of the Body, an Endowment highly valued by all men: Whereas
   on the contrary, vicious Courses, but especially Intemperance, defacing
   the inward pulchritude of the Soul, do change even the outward
   Countenance into an abhorred hue; as I have else where noted out of Dr.
   Moor.

   I should now dismiss this Particular, did not the great prevalency of
   this Vice of Intemperance, especially in drinking invite me to superadd
   something further of the pernicious effects and consequents of it.

   1. First, Then this Vice hath a very ill influence upon the Spirit and
   Soul of Man, degrading it, and subjecting it to the Body. The
   generality of Heathen Philosophers (as Bishop Wilkins observes) agree
   in this, That Sin is the Natural Cause of debasing the Soul, immersing
   it into a state of sensuality and darkness, deriving such an impotency
   and deformity upon the mind, as the most loathsome Diseases do upon the
   Body. I shall add, but especially Intemperance, which Clouds the
   understanding, disabling it to any Studies of sublime and subtile
   Speculation; the gross fumes of strong and inebriating Liquors, having
   a like effect upon the Understanding, as thick Foggs and Mists upon our
   bodily Eyes, hindring them from seeing things at a distance, or
   discerning clearly Objects that are near. Neither doth it only darken
   the Understanding, but mightily weaken the Memory, dulling also and
   impairing all the Parts and Faculties of the Soul; depressing and
   fastning down to the earth that Particle of the divine Breath:

   Atque affigit humi Divinæ particulam auræ:

   Stupifying and infatuating the Man by degrees, till at last there be
   little left of him but the outward shape, and that too very much marred
   and deformed.

   2. This Sin not only sows the Seeds of future Diseases, but very often
   is the occasion of many present Quarrels, and Fightings, and Wounds,
   and even Death it self. Prov. 23. 29. Who hath wo? Who hath sorrow? Who
   hath contentions? Who hath babblings? Who hath wounds without cause?
   Who hath redness of eyes? They that tarry long at the wine, they that
   go to seek mixt wine. Nothing more frequent than quarrelling and
   brawling at drinking Meetings, and sometimes challenging and duelling.
   Some also we now and then hear of, who being in Drink, by Falls from
   Horses, or other Casualties, have ruined or destroyed themselves; and
   alas, in what condition must such Men die!

   3, It occasions an unaccountable expence of time, which by all Wise Men
   is esteemed a most precious and inestimable Jewel; Cujus unius (saith
   Seneca) honesta est avaritia; which alone may honestly be coveted.
   Sometimes whole Afternoons and Nights being spent in drinking bouts,
   and as much time more before they can get clear of the evil effects of
   them. Time was not given us to waste in the service of our Lusts, but
   to bestow on the duties of God's Worship, or some honest Calling,
   whereby in our Places and Stations we may be serviceable to our
   Generations, and do good in the World: No Man need want employment, and
   yet if he did, he were better be idle, than not well occupied, as the
   Proverb is. He that hath no bodily Labor or Exercise to busy himself
   in, may find Work enough in cultivating his mind, in advancing and
   improving his Faculties, in searching out the Mysteries of Nature, and
   Works of God; whereby he may be induced to glorifie his Creator, to
   admire and celebrate his infinite Wisdom, Power and Goodness, and may
   probably hit upon something, which may be of publick use and benefit.

   When at the great day of account, the Supreme Judge of all Men shall
   demand of us, How we spent such an Afternoon, or such a Night, Think
   we, that we shall have the confidence to answer him, in drinking, or
   vain talking; or rather that we shall not stand mute, being ashamed to
   confess how we spent them; or that he would be satisfied with such an
   account should it be given him? Let us then be careful so to husband
   and manage, so to expend and improve our time, that we may have a good
   account to make thereof at that day.

   4. Intemperance is a chargeable and expensive Vice, unaccountably
   wasting the outward Estate. Prov. 23. 20, 21. Be not among wine
   bibbers, among riotous eaters of flesh: For the drunkard and the
   glutton shall come to poverty. Deerit egentibus Æs laquei pretium: They
   shall not have Money enough to buy them a Halter. No vice hath consumed
   so many Estates, and reduced so many of the meaner sort to poverty as
   this; which being so, men given to it would do well to consider
   before-hand, how unsupportable Poverty and Necessity will be to them
   who have lived plentifully; especially seeing instead of being pitied
   and relieved, they are like to be reproach'd and scorn'd by others. If
   Poverty makes all men ridiculous, as the Poet saith, much more then
   those who have brought it upon themselves by their own default. Men
   wild by riotous courses waste Estates left them by their Ancestors, I
   look upon as injurious to their Posterity; such Estates being not
   acquired by their industry, and consequently not theirs to dispose of,
   or make away, but only to use for term of Life, according to the
   intention of their Progenitors, by whom they were raised and left them.
   However, all are accountable to God for the expence of their Estates;
   Seneca could say, Tam expensorum quàm acceptorum rationem esse
   reddendam: We must give an account as well of what we spend, as of what
   we receive or get.

   5. Intemperance is a Vice contrary to Charity and Justice, disabling us
   to relieve the Poor, or contribute to any good Work. Can we think that
   he hath the least spark of Charity, or indeed common Humanity in him,
   who will spoil and destroy that, which will serve to support and
   maintain the indigent and necessitous; who will rather mischief
   himself, than benefit others; who will rather abuse and ruine his own
   Body, than refresh the fainting Spirits of his Brethren. Surely God
   intended that all that are born into the World, should have a portion
   in the World; not that one should devour and waite more than is fit,
   and another starve for want of Sustenance. All came alike naked into
   the World, and if Providence hath divided to thee more than to another,
   it hath made thee but a Steward to dispense thy Estate among others;
   which if thou be a good Man, possibly thou mayest do more to their
   advantage, than they would do themselves, were they owners of it, or
   were it equally divided among them. And this thou art to look upon as
   the main reason why God hath given to thee more than to them. The
   Scripture saith, Withhold not good from him to whom it is due; making
   relief a debt to the indigent; but to discharge debts is a piece of
   Justice, and not of Charity.

   But if he be unjust who relieves not the poor, though nothing related
   to him, what shall we call them of the poorer sort, who spend that at
   the Alehouses, which should serve to maintain their Families? who have
   Wives and Children at home that want Necessaries, and they consume upon
   their Lusts what should support them: these Men are something more than
   unjust, barbarous and inhumane. We find them in the black List of those
   whom the Apostle, Rom. 1. saith, are given up to a reprobate mind;
   a'storgoi, Men without natural affection.

   6ly. I might add, That this Vice is injurious to posterity, entailing
   Diseases upon them: Children do very often inherit the Distempers and
   Infirmities of their Parents, as well as the Shape and Lineaments of
   their Bodies. And therefore let men, as they love their Children, and
   tender their ease and well-being in this World, have a care lest by
   their debauches and excesses they contract diseases and ill habits of
   body on themselves, and derive them to their Issue; which if of the
   more painful sort, as Gout or Stone, may give their Children (I will
   not say just) cause to curse the day wherein they were born, and the
   Parents which begat and brought them forth.

   Lastly, This Vice blasts a Man's Reputation, Honour and Esteem in the
   World. As Virtue is honourable in the sight of all Men, there being
   scarce any Nation so salvage and barbarous, but pays some respect and
   veneration to it: So is Vice reproachful, and vicious Persons
   despicable; and among other Vices, especially Drunkenness, which makes
   a man a laughing-stock, a scorn and derision to the very vulgar, nay,
   to his own Companions; none being more apt to deride him than they: It
   turns Reason out of doors, and transforms a Man into a Beast, or
   something worse. Thus Seneca in his 84 Epistle: Dic quàm turpe sit,
   plus sibi ingerere quàm capiat, & stomachi sui non nôsse mensuram; quàm
   multa ebrii faciant, quibus sobrii erubescant; nihil aliud esse
   ebrietatem quàm voluntariam infantam, &c. Tell, saith he, a Drunkard,
   what a filthy thing it is to pour down more than he can keep, and not
   to know the measure of his Stomach: How many things Men do when they
   are drunk, of which they are ashamed when they are sober: That
   Drunkenness is nothing else but a voluntary Madness. Extend this Habit
   or Condition of the Drunken Man to many days, and you will not doubt of
   his Madness; so that it is no less a Phrenzy than any other, only a
   shorter. Relate to him the Example of Alexander the Great, who in a
   drunken fit killed Clitus, his most dear and faithful Friend; and
   afterward when he came to understand the Fact, he would have died: to
   be sure he deserved it.

   Drunkenness doth both inflame and discover other Vices, removing that
   Modesty which prevents and gives a check to evil Endeavours, and which
   God hath engrafted in our natures to be a powerful curb to restrain us
   from sin. For more abstain from Vice for fear of shame, than out of a
   good will and love to Virtue. When the strength of Wine hath got
   possession of the Soul, those Evils which before lay hid, shew
   themselves, and come abroad; for Drunkenness doth not make Vices, but
   manifest them, and bring them to light. Then the Adulterer doth not
   wait for the Twilight, or Bed-Chamber, but without delay gives full
   swinge to his Sensual Appetites. The unchaste person confesses and
   publishes his Disease: The Petulant and Quarrelsome cannot contain
   Tongue or Hand: The Insolent becomes more proud; the cruel more fierce
   and inhumane; the spightful more malignant and mischievous. Much more
   he hath worth the reading, for which I refer to the Book.

   Here some may possibly demand, What measures of eating and drinking are
   we to observe? I answer, What are most agreeable to the ends of eating
   and drinking; those are the support of our Bodies, and preserving them
   in the most perfect state of Health, I need give no more severe Rules
   than Physicians prescribe, and therefore I shall borrow two or three
   out of Riverius his Institutions.

   1. Akoresi'e trophes before mentioned out of Hippocrates; Never eat to
   satiety, but always rise from the Table with an Appetite; because in
   those who are in perfect health, the Appetite is strong, and lasts till
   the Stomach be too much filled; which repletion is very hurtful and
   prejudicial to Health.

   2. If you ordinarily take so much Meat and Drink, that afterward you
   feel a certain Torpor, heaviness and sluggishness of body, when as
   before you were active, brisk, and cheerful, it is a sign that you have
   exceeded the convenient measure of eating; and the quantity of Food is
   so long to be diminished, till the foresaid inconveniencies appear no
   more.

   3. If after Meat you find your self unfit for Study, Meditation,
   Contemplation, and other Functions as well of the Mind, as of the Body,
   it is clear that you exceed the just measures of eating and drinking.

   These Rules are to be observed chiefly by Scholars and Gentlemen, who
   are not exercised in continual bodily Labor.

   Secondly,

   Moderate Labour and Exercise conduces much to the maintenance and
   preservation of Health, aokni'e po'non as Hippocrates calls it not
   being slothful in labor: And Galen for that purpose prefers it before a
   spare Diet. It puts the Blood in motion thereby, increasing the natural
   heat, facilitating concoction and rendring it more thin and fluid, less
   apt to stagnate or coagulate, and more, easy to pass the capillary
   extremes of the Veins and Arteries, and so to irrigate and enliven all
   the Muscles and Members of the Body; by which means the Body becomes
   more robust, less obnoxious to external Injuries, and fit for any
   Action.

   Moreover, keeping the Blood in a due temper and degree of heat, it
   inables it by insensible perspiration, to cast off any noxious
   Particles, which might spoil its crasis, and put it into irregular
   motions, and breed divers diseases: Want of perspiration being the
   cause of almost all diseases. But of labor and diligence in our
   Callings, I shall have occasion to speak further under another Head.

   I might add something concerning rest or sleep, the moderation whereof
   hath some influence upon bodily Health; Physicians telling us, That the
   excess relaxes the tone of all the Members, oppresses the Head, and
   fills it with many Vapours and ill Humours, dulls the Wits, mars the
   Complexion and Habit of the Body, diminishes the native heat, and
   renders all the Parts and Members more sluggish and inept to motion.
   Neither is it less prejudicial to Wealth than to Health, bringing want
   and poverty upon those that give themselves up to it, Prov. 20. 13.
   Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty: Open thine eyes, and thou
   shalt be satisfied with Bread. Prov. 6. 9, 10, 11. How long wilt thou
   sleep, O sluggard? when wilt then arise out of thy sleep? Yet a little
   slumber, yet a little sleep, yet a little folding of the hands to
   sleep: So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want
   as an armed man; which is repeated Prov. 24. 33.

   Thirdly,

   A Third thing requisite to the preservation and continuance of Health,
   is a due government and moderation of our Passions, the excess of which
   hath great force in altering the temper of the Body, and in bringing on
   grievous diseases, and some times death it self. I shall instance in
   three.

   1. Anger, Which if not supprest at first but suffered to kindle in the
   Breast, breaks out suddainly into a violent flame, bearing down all
   before it, dethrones Reason, and turns the man into a Phrenetick: Ira
   furor brevis est: Anger is a short Madness, and if it be indulged and
   becomes unbridled, it may by the violent commotion of the Spirits, so
   alter and pervert the very crasis and temper of the Brain, as to
   introduce a lading and perpetual one. The like happens sometimes also
   in other passions; as grief, fear and love.

   2. Fear: What paleness and trembling doth it often cause? subverting
   the whole Oeconomy of the Body: Fear of poverty or disgrace hath driven
   many men to that extremity, as to lay violent hands upon themselves.
   Fear of death hath sometimes brought upon men that they feared. But
   above all, fear hath a very bad influence upon the Body in infectious
   diseases, especially in the Plague; in which a Reverend and Learned
   Person faith upon experience, It is a mortal Companion: And a late
   famous Physician in his Treatise upon that Disease: Pestis non est
   Pestis nisi adsit terror: The Pestilence is no Pestilence unless it be
   attended with terror.

   3. Sorrow and Sadness, the excess whereof is no less injurious to the
   health of the body than the forementioned Passions, abating the natural
   heat, and by degrees introducing a general languor and wasting; or by
   incrassating the humors for want of a due motion of the Blood, bringing
   on Melancholick and delirous effects.

   These and the like Passions the Scripture commands us either wholly to
   extirpate, or at least to moderate and subdue. 1 Anger, Coloss. 3. 8.
   But now you also put off all these, Anger, Wrath, Strife. Prov. 16. 32.
   He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth
   his own spirit, than he that taketh a City: Suitably whereto the Poet
   saith,

   Fortior est qui se quàm qui fortissima vincit.

   And doubtless whosoever shall subdue and matter this Passion, shall
   experience much joy and delight in the victory.

   As for Fear, if of Poverty or Want, we have God's promise for our
   security, That provision shall be made for us of all things necessary:
   Our Saviour tells us. That if we seek the Kingdom of God, and his
   righteousness, these outward things shall be added to us. Death we need
   not fear, as being to the godly but a passage into a better Life; and
   consequently are forbidden by our Saviour, to fear men, the word they
   can do to us being to kill the body.

   Immoderate Sorrow even for our dearest Relations and Friends is
   forbidden us by the Apostle, and yet this is an Affliction that wounds
   as deep as any. The uselesness of sorrow for any worldly loss, setting
   aside the ill influence it hath upon our health, is a sufficient
   argument against giving way to this Passion; Sorrow being so far from
   helping us, that it doth but add to our burthen. For what we bring upon
   our selves by our own default or negligence, so much trouble may be
   useful as to make us more careful for the future, and no more,

   --Flagrantior æquo

   Non debet dolor esse viri, nec vulnere major: [3]

   A Man's Grief ought not to be immoderate, not to exceed the cause of
   it.

CHAP. VI.

   Of Safety, Liberty and Quiet.

   Secondly, Safety, Liberty and Quiet conduce much to the Happiness of
   the outward Man.

   I refer these to one Head, because I find them linked together in
   Bishop Wilkins his Treatise of Natural Religion; and before him in
   Bishop Andrews his Manual of Devotions more than once, and because they
   are of near affinity one to another.

   1. By Safety I understand, 1. Freedom from force and violence,
   captivity, loss of Goods by Enemies, foreign or domestick, by Pirates
   and Robbers. For our security from these we have many promises in
   Scripture, Levit. 25. 18. If you shall do my Statutes, and keep my
   Judgments, ye shall dwell in the Land in safety. Prov. 1. 33. Whoso
   hearkneth unto me, shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of
   evil, Job 10. 18.

   2. Freedom from perils and dangers, and sad accidents; as Fire,
   Tempest, contagious Diseases, Terrors by Night; for our security from
   these also we are not without promises of the divine protection. Prov.
   12. 21. There shall no evil happen to the just, but the wicked shall be
   filled with mischief. Psal. 91. 3. He shall deliver thee from the snare
   of the Fowler, and from the noisome Pestilence. And v. 5. Thou shalt
   not be afraid for the terror by night, nor for the pestilence that
   walketh in darkness. Prov. 3. 23. Then shalt thou walk in thy way
   safely, and thy foot shall not stumble. Job 5. 19, 20. In famine he
   shall redeem thee from death, and in war from the power of the Sword,
   &c.

   II. By Liberty is meant, being at our own disposal, and not under
   Bondage, restraint or imprisonment; from which, obedience to the
   Commandments of God secures us. For the most usual causes of Sufferings
   of this nature are neglect of our duties, or vicious and illegal acts;
   as Murthers, Adulteries, Theft, Sedition, and the like, which are all
   contrary to God's Commandments; these enjoining us to obey Laws, to
   submit to Government, to do our own business, and not to be busy-bodies
   in other mens matters, &c.

   III. By Quiet is understood immunity from Troubles, and molestations
   proceeding from Enmity, Contentions, Law-suits, Immoderate Care and
   Anxiety about worldly things; Obedience to the Law of God doth in a
   great measure secure us from these: That commands us to love even our
   Enemies. Now who can be so barbarous and inhumane as to injure them
   that truly love him, and seek his good? Moreover the Scripture tells
   us, That when a mans ways please the Lord, he maketh even his enemies
   to be at peace with him, Prov. 16. 7. And the Apostle puts the
   Question, Who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that
   which is good? 1 Pet. 3. 13. As for Contentions and Law-suits, another
   Apostle adviseth us rather to suffer wrong than molest our selves and
   brethren with them. And for care and anxiety about worldly things,
   which is indeed a very tormenting Passion, we are forbidden it often in
   Scripture: And our Saviour, Matth. 6. 25, &c. produceth many Arguments
   or Considerations to arm us against it.

CHAP. VII.

   Of Riches.

   Thirdly, Riches are esteemed a great ingredient of our happiness and
   well-being in this world: though some are of opinion, that they
   contribute nothing thereto, but that a mean estate is the best; and
   therefore Agur prays, Prov. 30. 8. Give me neither poverty nor riches.
   And the Preacher, Eccles. 5. 11. Saith of Riches, What good is there to
   the owners thereof, save the beholding of them with their eyes? And the
   Heathen Poet Horace,

     --Si ventri bene, si lateri est, quid
     Divititæ possunt regales addere majus?

   If we are well provided with Food and Clothing, what more can Kingly
   Riches add to us? And the Apostle, 1 Tim. 6. 8. adviseth us, That
   having food and raiment; we should therewith be content; because they
   that will be rich, fall into temptation and a snare, and into many
   foolish and hurtful Lusts, which drown men in destruction and
   perdition. It is clear that Riches do expose to the temptations of
   Pride and Luxury, and the sad consequences thereof.

   You will say. If Riches have such an ill influence upon Mens Manners,
   why then are they proposed in Scripture as rewards to virtuous actions?
   why are they made the effects and fruits of God's Blessing?

   I answer, Riches if well used, and it is Our own fault if we use them
   not well, are real Blessings, enabling us to do much good in the World;
   to be rich in good Works, to relieve the Necessities of others, to feed
   the Hungry, to cloath the Naked, to redeem Prisoners and Captives, to
   deliver the Oppressed, to minister to the Sick convenient Diet and
   Physick, &c. And our Saviour tells us, That it is a more blessed thing
   to give, than to receive; and consequently to have whereof to give.

   I should now proceed to shew, That Riches are a Blessing promised to
   our Obedience, and likewise a natural consequent and effect of it: And
   in the first place to explain what is meant by Riches; but I find this
   so well done to my hand by [4] Dr. Wilkins, late Bishop of Chester,
   that I shall spare my pains, and only transcribe what I find upon this
   Head in his Treatise of the Principles of Natural Religion, Lib. 2.
   Cap. 4.

   The Word Riches is capable of a twofold sense.

   { Absolute,
     Relative.

   1. In the more absolute sense it may be defined to consist in such a
   measure of Estate, as may be sufficient to serve a Man's occasions and
   conveniencies; when his Possessions are so proportioned as fully to
   answer all the necessities of his condition, and afford him a
   comfortable subsistence according to his Quality, and the station
   wherein he is placed. In which sense men of all ranks and degrees are
   capable of being rich. A Husbandman or an ordinary Tradesman may as
   truly be styled a Rich Man, as a Gentleman, a Lord, or a King. Though
   perhaps what these can very well afford to fling away upon their
   Diversions be more than all the Estate and Possessions that the other
   can pretend to.

   And upon this ground all men grant, that a man may be as truly liberal
   in giving a Penny, but a poor Mite, as another in giving an Hundred
   Pounds; because these things are to be rneasured according to the
   different conditions of the Givers, or proportion of their Estates: And
   a Man may as well be rich with a little, as liberal with a little.

   Now though this be the true notion of Riches, yet in the opinion of
   Moralists and Philosophers is it not enough to denominate a man rich;
   but there is further required an Acquiescence of Mind, Contentment or
   Satisfaction with such a Sufficiency: Dives est, non qui plus habet,
   sed qui nihil cupit: He is not rich who hath much, but who covets no
   more. Aristotle affirms, That the true nature of Riches doth consist in
   the contented use and enjoyment of the things that we have, rather than
   in the possession of them. Those that out of penuriousness can scarce
   afford themselves the ordinary Conveniencies of Life, out of their
   large Possessions, have been always accounted poor: Such men may be
   truly said to want those things they have, because lying by useless, it
   is all one as if they had them not.

   Moreover, That Man who is not content with what is in it self
   sufficient for his condition, is not rich, nor ever will be so; because
   there can be no other real limits to his desires, but that of
   sufficiency, whatever is beyond this being boundless and infinite. And
   though men may please themselves with an imagination, that if they had
   but such an addition to their Estates, they should then think they had
   enough, yet that is but a mere imagination, there being no real cause
   why they should be more satisfied then, than they are now.

   2. Riches may be taken in a more relative sense, and so they may be
   described to consist in having large Possessions, when a man's Estate
   and Revenue is of such a proportion as is commonly esteemed great;
   whether with relation to the generality of other men; and so only those
   at the upper end of the world are capable of being counted rich; or
   else with respect to others of the same rank and order and so all such
   are accounted rich, who do in their Possessions exceed the common sort
   of those that are of the same rank with them; this kind of Wealth
   consisting properly in comparison; there being not any one determinate
   sum or proportion of revenue to which the name of Riches may be
   appropriated, but that it may be as much below the occasions of some
   persons, as it is above the condition of others, who yet live
   plentifully.

   Those that are rich in this comparative sense, may rather be styled
   proprietors of great Possessions, than truly rich; because though such
   Possessions be in themselves great, yet they may not be sufficient to
   free the owner of them from want and poverty, whether in respect to his
   real or imaginary occasions for more: And that is not Riches which
   cannot free a Man from being poor; and want of Necessaries is as truly
   Poverty in him that hath much, as in him that hath but little. He that
   in any one Condition of Life, hath enough to answer his Conveniencies,
   such a Man is more truly rich than he whose Revenue is a thousand times
   greater, if it be not equal either to his Occasions or his Mind. Riches
   in this second comparative sense are no where promised to our obedience
   to the Commandments of God, or to any particular Grace and Virtue; nor
   are they the natural effects and consequents of such Obedience; as if
   he that were godly, should be thereby advanced to the greatest
   Possessions that any man else doth enjoy; but only that Religion will
   be a means to supply him with such a sufficiency as may denominate him
   rich, and free him from such necessities, whether real or imaginary, as
   others of his rank are liable to.

   1. Riches are proposed in Scripture as a Reward or Blessing to them
   that fear God, and keep his Commandments. It is said of Wisdom, that is
   the fear of God, which in several places of Scripture is said to be the
   beginning of Wisdom, or the chief Wisdom; nay, Wisdom it self, Job 28.
   28. And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is Wisdom;
   and to depart from evil is understandmg. Prov. 3. 16. That length of
   days are in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and honour, &c.
   c. 8. 18. Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches, &c. And
   again, V. 21. That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance,
   and I will fill their treasures. Psal. 34. 9. They that fear the Lord,
   there is no want to them. Levit. 26. 3, &c. God promises to the
   Israelites, if they will walk in his Statutes, and keep his
   Commandments, a confluence of all worldly Blessings; and the like in
   Deut. 18. The Apostle tells us, 1 Tim. 4. 8, That Godliness hath the
   promises as well of this life, as of that which is to come.

   2. The fear of God, and the practice of several Virtues commanded by
   him, are the most effectual means to gain and increase Riches: As

   1. Diligence and Industry in our Callings, The hand of the diligent
   maketh rich, Prov. 10. 4. No gains without pains. Man is born to labor,
   as the sparks fly upward. God hath not sent us into the world like
   Leviathan, to take our pastime here, but to bear our part of the
   Burthens of Mankind. Tho' a Man be born to an Estate sufficient to
   maintain him without Labor, yet I look upon him as unjust, if he lives
   upon the Sweat of other Mens Brows, and is not some way or other so
   helpful and beneficial to them, as to compensate for his Food and
   Raiment: Every man that hath Riches is accountable to God for the
   expence of them; being, as I said before, but a Steward to him who is
   the supreme Proprietor.

   2. Justice and Honesty in our Dealings: It is commonly said, That
   honesty is the best Policy; and so in this particular we find it in
   experience to be; those Tradesmen having the greatest custom, and
   quickest returns, who are noted for their just and honest Dealings,

   3. Temperance and Sobriety: These conduce as well to the encreasing of
   our Estates, as the health of our Bodies, cutting off all superfluous
   Expences in gratifying our Sensual Appetites and Desires: Whereas the
   contrary Vices of Voluptuousness and Luxury, to which we may add
   Idleness, Prodigality, Pride, are known waiters of Estates, often
   bringing men to a morsel of bread, and clothing them with rags, as
   Solomon saith.

   But besides the having a sufficiency of all things necessary and
   convenient in reference to our rank and order in this world; to
   denominate us truly rich, as I said before, there is required
   contentment and satisfaction of mind with such a sufficiency, and a
   free use of the things we have, which is attainable only by Religion;
   that teaches and enables us to be content with our Estates, and to live
   comfortably without such things as others know not how to want, Heb.
   13. 5. Be content with such things as ye have; for he hath said, I will
   never leave thee nor forsake thee. The ability of being content with a
   little, may much more truly be called Riches, than the having of much
   without being satisfied therewith: As it is better to be in health with
   a moderate Appetite, than to be continually eating and drinking under
   the disease of a boulimi'a [voracious Appetite] or a Dropsy: And in
   this sense a little that the righteous hath is better than great riches
   of the ungodly.

   Now that the fear of God, and practice of those Virtues he commands us,
   is a real means of procuring and preserving a sufficiency of worldly
   Goods, and contentment therewith, we find confirmed by experience: Let
   any man impartially consider, what kind of persons those are, among the
   generality of Men, who in their several degrees and orders are
   accounted most able, and most wealthy; and it will appear that they are
   such as are most diligent in their Callings, most just and honest in
   their Dealings, most regular and sober in their Conversations, most
   liberal towards any good Work: Upon which account it is that such
   places, where men have the opportunity of being instructed in, and
   excited to the Duties of Religion, do thereupon thrive and flourish
   most; it being one property of Religion to civilize men, and make them
   more inquisitive in Learning, and more diligent in practising their
   several Professions. And as for contentment of Mind, it is not to be
   obtained but upon the account of Religion, Piety and Virtue: Such men
   need not fear future want, because they have God's Promise for their
   security: Let them but do good, and put their trust in him, and verily
   they shall be fed. They are also to consider, that great Riches cannot
   make them more happy than they are, but rather expose them to
   Temptations.

   But it may be objected, 1. That there are some kinds of Virtue which
   seem to have a contrary tendency, as Charity to those that want, Bounty
   and Liberality to any good Work. To which I answer,

   That these Acts may very well consist with Riches in the most proper
   Notion of it, as it denotes a sufficiency for our Occasions; the
   ability of contributing in some proportion towards any worthy and
   charitable Work being in the esteem of every good Man one Of those
   occasions and conveniencies required to such a sufficiency, and cannot
   any more be a prejudice to it, than it would be for a Man to lay up
   some part of his Estate in the safest place, to lend it out upon the
   best interest, to part with it for the purchase of the same favour and
   assistance from others in the like exigencies; to lay it out upon his
   pleasure, with respect to that inward comfort and satisfaction which
   doth accompany the Conscience of doing worthy things. And besides all
   this, experience will assure us, that there is a secret Blessing, which
   doth for the most part accompany such Actions; so that Men grow the
   richer, not the poorer for them, according to that Proverb, Giving to
   the poor, increases a Man's store: And they that in this kind sow
   bountifully, do often even in this world, reap bountifully.

   Obj. 1. There are some kinds of Vice that seem to have a tendency to
   the enriching of men; as Fraud, Extortions, Sordidness, all kinds of
   unlawful ways of getting and keeping an Estate. But to this it may be
   said,

   1. That these Vices may tend to the encreasmg of Mens Possessions, but
   not to the making of them truly rich; and it is a plain Argument that
   such persons do not think themselves to have a sufficiency, who can
   apply themselves to such wretched Courses for the getting more.

   2. 'Tis commonly seen in experience, that there is a secret Curse
   attends such Practices, a Canker that eats into such Gain, a Hole in
   the bottom of the Bag, by which it insensibly drains out, and wastes
   away; Malè parta malè dilabuntur: He that shall carefully observe the
   usual course of things in the World, may from his own experience find
   Instances enough to confirm those Sayings of the Wiseman, Prov. 11. 24.
   There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that
   withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty. Chap. 13. 11,
   22. Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished. The wealth of the
   sinner is laid up for the just. Chap. 22. 16. He that oppresseth the
   poor to increase his riches, shall certainly come to want. Chap. 28. 8.
   He that by unjust gain increaseth his substance, shall gather it for
   him that will pity the poor.

   But if a man who by Extortion or unjust gain raises an Estate, happens
   to transmit it to his Posterity, he usually entails upon them a Curse
   together with it, it decaying by degrees, and coming to nothing: De
   malè quæsitis vix gaudet tertius hæres: The third Heir scarce ever
   enjoying an ill-gotten Estate.

   Obj. 3. It may be objected, That there are some good Men that are poor;
   and that God hath chosen the poor of this world to receive the Gospel,
   and to be rich in faith, James 2. 5. To this it may be said,

   1. That the Providence of God may so order it sometimes, as to reduce
   good Men to great exigencies, to wander up and down in Sheeps-Skins,
   and Goats-Skins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented: But then these
   are particular exempt Cases, such as are not suitable to the most usual
   and general course of things. But besides, such as are good Men may
   sometimes be defective in several of those Duties which Religion doth
   oblige them to, as Diligence, Caution, &c. And the poverty of such may
   justly be ascribed to their defect in Religion.

   2. As for that Scripture, That God hath chosen the poor in this world;
   it is not to be understood in the more absolute sense for such as want
   Necessaries; because it's plain from other Texts, That though some of
   the Primitive Believers were by reason of the Persecution of those
   times, reduced to great exigencies, yet the generality of the rest were
   very liberal in their Contributions towards them. But it must be
   understood in the Relative Sense, concerning such as might be styled
   comparatively poor; that is, such as were of a lower rank, and meaner
   condition than others, and consequently had less Temptation to corrupt
   and seduce them, than those that did more abound in these earthly
   things; of whom our Saviour saith, It is hard for a rich Man to enter
   into the Kingdom of God.

   It may further be objected by those of the lowest rank of poor: We are
   as it were condemned to perpetual Poverty; our condition is so mean,
   and our charge so great, and the gain so small and inconsiderable,
   which comes in by our utmost Labor and Industry, that it will scarce
   suffice to provide things absolutely necessary for the support of our
   selves and dependents; so far are we from any possibility of mending
   our Estates, or growing rich.

   To These I answer, That we do not say, That all that are truly
   religious shall certainly grow rich, let their Circumstances be what
   they will; but only that obedience to God's Commands is the most likely
   way of improving and advancing a man's Estate, that hath means and
   opportunities of gaining; which though God hath denied thee, yet hast
   thou no reason to be discontented with thy Condition, or to complain
   that thou art hardly dealt with: Thou art not so forlorn, destitute,
   neglected a Wretch as thou may'st imagine. There is a great Philosopher
   affirms, That there is no Man born into the World, and grown up to
   years of discretion, but hath received more good at the hands of God
   than evil, more pleasure than pain; though he overlooks and considers
   not the pleasure, as thinking it due to him, but fixes too much upon
   the pain; which is indeed due, and for the most part deserved. And
   another great [5] Divine saith thus, Suppose all manner of evils and
   afflictions, which are now promiscuously scattered up and down in the
   world, whether they concern Soul or Body; Spiritual Blindness and
   Obduracy, Poverty, Slavery, Reproach, Sickness, Pain, Maimedness,
   Deformity, &c. I say, suppose all these were to be distributed among
   Mankind, so as every one were to have an equal share of them; would you
   be content to stand to this distribution? I suppose there are not many
   persons in this Nation in so miserable and forlorn a condition, that
   upon serious consideration of the special advantages they do, or may
   partake of, above many other Millions in the World, would consent to
   it. But I shall add further for thy encouragement, and the vindication
   of the goodness of God to thee; That he hath put thee into a near
   capacity of obtaining as happy an Estate, as the rich, or learned, or
   powerful: The Gate of Heaven is set open to thee, eternal Life and
   Immortality offered to thee, upon more easie terms in some respect,
   than to the rich and mighty. Consider that God may on purpose set thee
   in a low station, put thee into a mean condition to remove from thee
   the Temptations to Pride, Luxury, and other Vices, which Riches or
   Honour would have exposed thee to, and which he foresaw thou wouldest
   not be able to resist. Consider that he is Wise, and knows better what
   Condition is fit for thee than thou thy self dost; and likewise good,
   and hath therefore chosen what is best and most proper for thee. Bestir
   thy self then and make a Virtue of Necessity, and what thou must
   suffer, suffer patiently, resigning thy Will to the Will of God: And
   seeing thou hast not, nor art ever likely to obtain those things, in
   the enjoyment whereof many Men falsly place their happiness, labour
   after durable Riches and Righteousness, an Inheritance incorruptible
   and undefiled, and that fadeth not away: Be not contented to be
   miserable here, and eternally miserable hereafter, when thou needest
   not: And seeing God hath denied thee these wordly Goods, to compel
   thee, as it were, to seek after better. This course, if thou takest,
   [of loving and fearing God, and keeping his Commandments], thou shalt
   not only obtain eternal Life hereafter, but also render thy condition
   tolerable, nay comfortable to thee here: Thou shalt enjoy inward peace
   and satisfaction of Mind, and for thy outward estate, God will, if he
   fees it best for thee, raise thee up Friends to assist thee; or
   otherwise make such provision for thee, that thou shalt not want what
   is necessary for thy support and maintenance.

CHAP. VIII.

   Of Pleasure.

   Fourthly;

   I Proceed to Pleasure, which is either bodily or spiritual, sensual, or
   intellectual. But first I shall endeavour to explain what is meant by
   this Word Pleasure, what is the true sense and notion of it.

   Pleasure is that agreeable and delightful Sense that is excited in the
   Soul, either by an impression or motion made upon the outward Organs or
   Sensation, by any suitable Object, and conveyed by the Nerves to the
   Brain; or else by internal consideration and reflection upon any Object
   or Action by the understanding. Those are called pleasant Tastes or
   Smells which are apt to cause such a gentle motion of the Nerves
   belonging to the Organs of those Senses, the Tongue and Nose; as is
   naturally destined to excite a grateful and delicious sense in the
   Soul: Those delectable Sights, which in like manner affect our Eyes, as
   curious Pictures and Statues, artificial Engines, elegant and regular
   Motions: Those agreeable Sounds which have a charming influence on our
   Ears, as Musick and Harmony. The Touch or Feeling is gratified and
   delighted by various Motions of those Nerves which do not minister to
   the other Senses.

   To the Senses of Touch and Taste, appertain those Pleasures, which by
   the wise Providence of God are annexed to the satisfaction of our
   natural Appetites.

   These Appetites implanted in us, and all Animals, are to those Things
   or Actions, which serve either to the support and preservation of the
   Individuum, or each particular Animal; or to the propagation of the
   Kind. Those which serve to the support and preservation of the
   Individuum, are the Appetites of Meat and Drink, or the Actions of
   Eating and Drinking: To which the Divine Providence hath not only
   premised a painful Sense of Hunger to be a Monitor to us when we have
   need of Meat and Drink, and compel us to the use of them; but hath also
   annexed Pleasure to the very Actions of Eating and Drinking, which
   otherwise would have been no very grateful Exercise.

   This Pleasure of eating and drinking abides no longer than till the
   Necessities of Nature are satisfied, and so far Religion doth allow of
   it. When our Hunger and Thirst are well appeased, all that follows is
   but a faint kind of Pleasure, if it be not rather to be styled Satiety,
   or Glutting: Yet doth not the use of Meats and Drinks consist in an
   indivisible point; there is a more moderate and restrained use of them:
   When we keep within the bounds of our Appetites; akoresi'e trophes as
   Hippocrates calls it, not feeding to satiety, nor of the most delicate
   Viands. This ought to be our daily practice; and there is a more free
   and liberal use of them in feasting, which is also allowed us upon
   occasions of Joy; and on Days of Thanksgiving; as Marriages,
   Christenings, Victory over publick Enemies, Commemorations of great
   Mercies to Mankind in general, our own Nation, or our selves in
   particular: Such are the Festivals of our Saviour's Nativity,
   Resurrection, Ascension, Mission of the Holy Ghost, &c. Our Saviour
   himself was pleased to honour a Marriage-feast with his presence: And
   he accepted of a great Feast from Matthew at his calling, Luke 5. 25.
   But to speak in general, the Apostle saith, God giveth us all things
   richly to enjoy. And the Wiseman, Eccles. 5. 18. It is good and comely
   for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labor
   that he taketh under the Sun, all the days of his Use, which God giveth
   him; for it is his portion: And in the next Verse he saith, It is the
   gift of God. The same we have, Chap. 3. 13, So we see God allows us a
   free use, and cheerful enjoyment of these outward Blessings. We are to
   serve God with joyfulness and gladness of heart, for the abundance of
   all things, Deut. 28. 47. God doth not prohibit us the use and
   participation of these or any other sensible Pleasures, that are
   agreeable to Reason, or our true Interests; but only our Mistakes and
   Excesses, in and about them (as the Bishop of Chester speaks) teaching
   us so to regulate our selves in the life of them, that they may truly
   deserve the name of Pleasure.

   As for those Appetites and Actions which tend to the propagation and
   continuance of the Species and the Pleasures that attend them, God hath
   not denied us a moderate and regular satisfaction and use of them; nay,
   in some cases commanded it.

   Now the most sincere Pleasure proceeds from such a moderate, regular,
   seasonable, well circumstantiate use; such an enjoyment as may be
   reflected upon without horror, fear of Punishment, or consciousness of
   guilt, which attends the excessive, irregular, unseasonable use, or
   rather, the abuse of them, and renders the thought and memory of them
   very bitter and grievous: But of this particular I have written in a
   former [6] Treatise.

   But here it may be objected, That our Saviour in the Gospel hath
   abridged us of some Pleasures of this kind, which are not in themselves
   sinful or unlawful, as having been permitted by God to the Jews, and
   practised by the Ancient Patriarchs, and other men eminent for Piety,
   without reproof, I mean, the use of many Wives.

   To which I answer, That granting Polygamy not to be in it self
   unlawful, or to have any natural turpitude in it; yet is our Saviour's
   Prohibition grounded upon good Reason, viz. because God at the first
   created Mankind Male and Female; that is, one Female only, as well as
   one Male; and in effect he doth so still; there being as many, nay more
   Males than Females born into the World: And therefore it is
   unreasonable that some men should have many Wives, because they cannot
   have them unless others lack.

   That there are more Males than Females born, appears, by the Catalogues
   in all places, where accounts have been taken of the number of each
   Sex: And I doubt not but the case is the same in all places where such
   accounts have not been taken.

   It may here be asked why these Appetites are so vehement and
   importunate?

   I answer, To secure the great end of continuing the Species, and
   carrying on the World: For had they been weak and languid, it might
   have come to pass, that through inadvertency, or to avoid the labor and
   trouble of bringing up Children, and maintaining of Families, the
   greatest part of men might have abstained from such Actions, and so the
   Race of Mankind by degrees have been extinct, and the World dispeopled.

   That these Appetites are so extravagant and irregular, and not without
   great difficulty to be moderated and ruled, or kept within bounds, is
   an effect of the Apostasy of Man: That God permits them so to continue,
   one cause may be, that they may be matter wherein to exercise Virtue:
   For were these vicious Inclinations, and inordinate Appetites taken
   way, were men left in absolute indifferency to Good and Evil, there
   could be no such thing as Virtue and Vice, nothing praise, or
   blame-worthy, no place for Rewards or Punishments. For the exercise of
   Virtue consists in resisting, and striving against vicious Appetites,
   subduing Passions, and mortifying of Lusts; and those that labour
   herein, are virtuous Persons. Those that are slothful, that lay the
   Reins upon the Necks of their Lusts, and follow whither they lead and
   hurry them away, are vicious,

   You will say, Are not these Exercises painful and repugnant to our
   natural Appetites and Inclinations, and consequently contrary to
   Pleasure? Is. not the subduing of Lusts compared to the cutting off of
   Members, which cannot be done without pain?

   I answer, It must be granted, that there is difficulty at first in the
   New Birth, in passing from one state to another, all Excellent things
   being hard to obtain, Difficilia quæ pulchra. Indeed we are so made as
   not much to value that which cost us no pains; and on the contrary, as
   Dr. Cockburn well observes, the Mind of Man is never so well pleased,
   as when it useth its Reason, and always takes most delight in the
   things which it self hath wrought. And therefore, as he proceeds, it
   was, and is wisely provided, to set the Necessaries, the Comforts, and
   Conveniences of Life at some distance from Laziness and Sloth, and to
   hedge them about with some difficulties, that while we search and
   labour for them, we may at the same time, and by the same means improve
   our Intellectual Faculties, and carry on the growth and perfection of
   our Souls. I might add, That the labor and exercise of the Body doth
   also conduce much to the Health and Strength, and Well-being of that.
   For as Hippocrates well saith, a'skesis ugie`s aokni'e po'non,
   unslothfulness in Labour, if I may make such a Word, is the means to
   preserve health.

   And, not only bodily Necessaries, but the knowledge of the Mysteries of
   Nature and the Works of God, and curious Mathematical Speculation, is
   to be obtained with Study and Industry. For by this use and exercise of
   our Intellectual Faculties, our Mind and Understanding is highly
   advanced and improved to such a degree, as suddenly to penetrate and
   comprehend the most abstruse and subtile Inventions and Notions of
   Naturalists and Mathematicians. And as Weapons and Utensils by lying by
   unoccupied do contract a Scurf or Rust, but do usu & tractatione
   spendescere; become bright by handling and use; so do our
   Understandings also. And though this study and contention of mind be
   laborious and painful, yet the enlarging the Understanding, and
   acquisition of Knowledge, and hitting upon useful Discoveries and
   Inventions, do abundantly compensate for that; nay, sometimes fill the
   Mind with unspeakable joy and pleasure. Pythagoras was so overjoyed at
   the invention of the 49th Proportion of the first Book of Euclide's El.
   that he sacrificed a Hecatombe to the Gods: And I have read of a Smith,
   that upon the invention of an Engine to make Water to ascend by
   descending, which was nothing else but Archimedes his Screw, and which
   had been invented long before, though he knew nothing of it, was so
   overwhelmed with joy, that it broke his Brains, and quite distracted
   him.

   No wonder then that Virtue which is the most excellent of all
   acquisitions should be difficult to attain. Indeed the difficulty and
   labor of attaining and exercising of it, makes it to be commendable or
   rewardable. And therefore though it be in it self an excellent thing,
   and may be said to be its own reward, yet because it is difficult and
   uneasy to Flesh and Blood, in this our lapsed and degenerate Estate,
   God is pleased for our encouragement, to propose to us an ample reward,
   no less than eternal Life and Happiness. He hath promised to give grace
   and glory, and to withhold no good thing from them who lead a holy
   life. And if this be not sufficient to quicken our endeavours, and to
   encourage us to strive, and wrestle, and run, nothing can; for I am
   sure a greater than this cannot be proposed, it containing all the good
   we can desire, or are indeed capable of enjoying. The Heathen Poet
   tells us.

   Tes d' aretes idrota theoi` propa'roithen e'thekan
   Atha'natoi; makro`s de` kai` o'rthios oimos ep' aute'n,
   Kai` trechu`s to` proton.

   The Gods have set Sweat before Virtue, the way to which is long, steep
   and rough at the first: But afterward that becomes easy and delightful,
   which was at first difficult; and a great deal of pleasure and joy
   attends the very contention with, and conquests of our Lusts and
   Passions; and that godly sorrow that is required as one of the first
   acts in the change of our condition, is always accompanied with secret
   pleasure: And as it is said of wicked Men, That in the midst of
   laughter their heart is sorrowful; so may it be said of good Men, That
   in the midst of their sorrow their heart is joyful. On the other hand,
   there are far greater difficulties and pains to be undergone in the
   Service and Drudgery of impetuous Lusts. [7] The Trouble of being cured
   is not so great as that of being sick; nor is the trouble of being
   sober comparable to .that of being debauched, and intemperate. Non est
   (saith Seneca) ut quibusdam dictum est, arduum in virtutes & asperum
   iter; plano adeuntur. Non vanæ vobis auctor rei venio; facilis ear ad
   beatam vitam via, inite modò bonis auspiciis, ipsisque Diis bene
   juvantibus, &c. The way to Virtue is not (as some have written) steep
   and rough, but plain and level. Let me become to you the Author of a
   new, and not frivolous thing. The way to a happy Life is easy, do but
   enter upon it with God's help: It is much more difficult to do what
   they [wicked Men] do. What is more facile than calmness and quiet of
   mind? What more laborious than Anger? What more remiss and void of
   trouble than Clemency? What more busy and toilsome than Cruelty?
   Chastity is vacant and at ease: Lust is always occupied and unquiet. He
   that tells Lies is hard put to it to maintain and make them good; and
   yet for all his shifts, is often detected, and put to shame: Whereas he
   that speaks truth is void of all fear and trouble. The like may be said
   of other Virtues and Vices compared together: So that Virtue is in it
   self more agreeable to Reason, and more easy and eligible than Vice;
   and it proceeds from the pravity and corruption of our Natures, that we
   do not chuse it accordingly.

   Besides, in all Pleasures we are to consider, whether the subsequent
   pain and sorrow do not outweigh the present enjoyment; which if it do,
   the voluptuary Philosophers themselves advise to abstain from them. Now
   the Pleasures of sin, (as the Scripture calls them) as Intemperance and
   Impurity do often bring upon the committers of them Pain and Sickness,
   and sometimes noisome Diseases in this Life; but, to be sure, eternal
   Misery and Distress in the World to come: Between which, and a short
   and transient Pleasure, there is no proportion. I might add hereto the
   Judgment of Seneca, concerning the filthiness and unmanliness, of these
   Vices of Intemperance and Lust: Nulli (saith he) turpitùs occupati
   sunt: No Men are more sordidly employed. Etiamsi vanâ gloriæ imagine
   teneantur, speciosè tamen errant: Licet avaros mihi, &c. If Men be
   taken with a vain image of glory, they err, but yet speciously. Should
   you enumerate to me covetous Persons, or angry Men, or such as exercise
   unjust hatred, or war one against another; all these viriliùs peccant,
   sin more manly: But such as give up, or prostitute themselves to
   Gluttony, Drunkenness, and Lust, eorum inhonesta labes est; their stain
   is dishonourable and sordid.

   Of the Pleasures of the Senses of Seeing, Hearing, and Swelling I shall
   say nothing, but that if duly circumstantiated, and placed upon proper
   Objects, they have no turpitude in them, but may lawfully be enjoyed.
   Of Seeing and Hearing I have said something in a former Discourse.

   As for those things which we call by the name of Sports and Diversions,
   Religion doth likewise admit of a moderate use of these: And what is
   beyond such a use doth rather tire Men, than recreate them: [8] It
   being as much the property of such things to weary a Man, when he is
   once sufficiently refreshed by them, as it is to refresh him when he is
   wearied by other things.

   Of Intellectual Pleasures we shall speak when we come to treat of the
   Happiness of the inward Man.

   Here it may be objected, That the Life of a Christian is a melancholy
   and mournful Life, and that we must take leave of all the Pleasures and
   Delights of the World, when once we enter upon it. Doth not Salomon
   say, Eccles. 7. 2. It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to
   the house of feasting, &c. V. 3. Sorrow is better than laughter, for by
   the sadness of the countenance, the heart is made better. V. 4. The
   heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; and the heart of fools
   is in the house of mirth.

   This is a great prejudice against a holy Life, and deters many Men from
   venturing up it. They are loath to part with all Mirth and Jollity and
   Pleasure, which they esteem the chief Happiness of their Lives, and to
   live more retrained and regular Lives; at least they desire to enjoy
   them a little longer, till they are tired and glutted with them,
   deferring their Repentance to Sickness or old Age.

   To this I answer, That innocent mirth and joy, or even feasting it
   self, are not absolutely forbidden. The same Author tells us, That
   there is a time to weep, and a time to laugh: A time to mourn, and a
   time to dance: And that every thing is beautiful in its Season; nay,
   Christians are commanded to rejoice evermore. But in this place he
   compares Laughter and Sorrow; Feasting and Mourning together, and
   prefers the latter, and upon very good reason; because Feasting is
   oftentimes an occasion of temptation to intemperance and excess in
   eating and drinking; idle and vain talk; scurrilous and prophane
   jesting; lascivious Songs, which tend to corrupt Mens Manners,
   effeminate their Minds, and bring them in love with sensual and
   bruitish Pleasures. Whereas from sorrow and mourning there is no such
   danger, whatever the occasion of it be; whether publick calamities,
   losses, death of Relations, or Friends. Thereby we are brought to
   consider the uncertainty of all these outward Enjoyments, not to
   overvalue them, or set our hearts upon them, that so we may hot be
   overwhelmed with grief at the loss of them; to bewail our own and
   others Sins, which for the most part bring these afflictions and
   sufferings upon our selves, or them; to condole with, comfort and
   support those who are too much dejected and apt to sink under their
   burthens.

CHAP. IX.

   Of Honour and Reputation.

   Fifthly,

   A Fifth thing conducive to the happiness of the outward Man is Honour
   and Reputation a Blessing highly to be valued, and much to be preferred
   before Riches or Pleasures, or even Life it self. Prov. 22. 1. A good
   name is rather to be chosen than great Riches, and loving favour rather
   than Silver and Gold. Eccles. 7. 1. A good name is better than precious
   Ointment. It is a Proverb among the Vulgar, Take away my good name, and
   take away my life: Intimating, that it is as dear to them as their
   Lives. Much more then will a generous person chuse rather to die, than
   to do any unworthy thing, that may expose him to Infamy, or Mali his
   Reputation. And because it is a thing of so great excellency, therefore
   we do pay it as the best service we can do, and return we can make to
   God. and his Deputies, Magistrates and Parents. Honour is a good thing,
   whereby we not only reap many advantages while we live, but that doth
   also survive us, and abide after us when we are gone out of the World,
   Psal. 112. 6. The Righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance. There
   is in Man a natural desire to have a good Name perpetuated and
   mentioned with honour when, he is dead and gone; which (as a learned
   [9] Prelate saith) is a sign that there is in Humane Nature some
   presage of a Life after Death, in which they hope, among other Rewards
   of well doing, to meet with this also, to be well spoken of to
   Posterity. And another [10] Man among many tokens of immortality, hath
   by secret instinct a natural desire to be thought of and spoken of in
   after-times. Honour is a great spur and encouragement to virtuous
   Actions: Every Man (saith the forementioned Author) that hath any spark
   of generosity in him, is desirous of fame; and though Men care not how
   soon it comes, yet they will be glad to have it after Death, rather
   than not at all. And (Bishop Wilkms faith) The more wise and virtuous
   any Man is, the more care will he take to transmit a grateful Memory of
   himself to future times, that he be well spoken of, that his Name may
   be as a precious Ointment, leaving a Perfume behind it; that Men may
   rise up at the mention of it, and call him blessed. Nor (saith he) can
   any Man despise Honour; but he that doth either despair of it, or
   resolve against doing any thing that may deserve it. And certainly
   (saith the Arch-Bishop) he that hath no regard to his Fame, is lost to
   all purposes of Virtue and Goodness. When a Man is once come to this,
   not to care what others say of him; the next step is to have no care
   what he himself does. Quod Conscientia est apud Deum, id fama est apud
   Homines: What Conscience is in respect of God, that Fame is in respect
   of Men. Next to a good Conscience, a clear Reputation ought to be to
   every Man the dearest thing in the World.

   You'll say, What is Honour?

   It is very Well defined by the [11] Bishop of Chester, often mentioned,
   to be, The esteem and good opinion Men have concerning the person or
   actions of another, together with such external Expressions of respect
   as are suitable thereunto.

   Now this so valuable a good is the peculiar reward of Virtue and Piety,
   1 Sam. 2. 30. Them that honour me, 1 will honour, and them that despise
   me, shall be lightly esteemed, Prov. 4. 8, 9. Solomon saith of Wisdom,
   that is the fear of God, Exalt her, and she shall promote thee, and
   bring thee to honour. She shall give to thy head an Ornament of grace,
   and a crown of glory, Prov. 10. 7. The memory of the just is blessed,
   but the name of the wicked shall rot, Prov. 3. 35. The wise shall
   inherit glory: But shame shall be the promotion of fools. Piety and
   Virtue command a respect from all sorts of Men. Good Men hold
   themselves obliged to give it, by the Command of God, and the
   excellency of the thing, it being a gift of God; and wicked Men though
   they may deny that outward respect that is due to good and righteous
   persons; yet even these cannot but have an inward veneration for
   Goodness and Religion. It is very remarkable, that even the rude and
   licentious Vulgar at Rome had such a reverence of the Person of Cato,
   that though such lewdness was permitted by the Law in the Festival of
   Flora, yet so long as he was present in the Theatre, they could not go
   on with their obscene sports, nor have the confidence to demand those:
   Florales joci nudandarum meretricum, as Seneca calls them. The wicked
   indeed hate the righteous, because his life is a reproof to them, and
   gives them some check in their vicious courses, taking from them their
   great excuse of the impossibility of God's Commandments; and
   demonstrating, that through the assistance of Divine Grace, which is
   always granted to them who do what in them lies, and pray for it; it is
   possible to obey them to such a degree as will be accepted by God:
   Wicked Men though they hate Virtue in the Subject, yet simply and
   abstractedly they acknowledge it to be good; though in their practice
   they prefer Vice before Virtue; yet never any arrived to to that degree
   of sottishness, as to say, it was better than Virtue: For example;
   better to be a glutton, and a drunkard than a temperate Person; to
   cheat and defraud, than to be just and righteous in our dealings: And
   therefore, though they hate and persecute Men for being religious, yet
   they disguise the Subject of their hatred, pretending it to be
   Hypocrisie, Heresie, Superstition, or the like, that they hate them
   for. Whence it appears, that they are self condemned Persons. Seneca in
   his Fourth Book, De Beneficiis cap. 17. hath much to this purpose, Adeò
   gratiosa est virtus (saith he) ut insitum etiam malis sit probare
   meliora: Virtue is so gracious, that it is naturally ingrafted even in
   bad Men to approve that which is good. And again. Nec quisquam tantum à
   naturalis lege descivit & hominem exuit, ut animi causâ malus sit.
   Neither hath any Man so far degenerated from the natural Law, and put
   off Man, as to be wicked for his minds sake, or only because it is his
   pleasure to be so. And again, Maximum hoc habemus à naturâ meritum,
   quod virtus in omnium animos lumen suum permittit, etiam qui non
   sequuntur, illam vident: Nature hath herein deserved exceeding well of
   us, That Virtue sends its light into all Mens Minds, even they that do
   not follow it, yet see it.

   Against what is generally said, That there is nothing truly honourable
   but Virtue, it may be objected, that Learning and Knowledge is
   honourable, and yet it is not always accompanied with Virtue, there
   being some learned Men vicious, as St. Augustine also supposes in that
   Saying, Quid prodest esse peritum & periturum? I answer, That the
   acquisition of Learning and Knowledge is by something virtuous and
   commendable, viz. Labour and Industry in a Calling; nay, Knowledge it
   self being that which all Men naturally desire, and being some
   participation of a divine Perfection, viz. Omniscience; and being that
   which distinguishes us from and advances us above brute Beasts, and
   makes us capable of Virtue and Happiness, a higher degree of it,
   exalting our Faculties, enabling us to ad in a larger Sphere, and to do
   more good, must be acknowledged to be an excellent quality, and to
   merit some honour and respect; and all Men generally think so, and give
   it accordingly.

   That it doth so, appears further from the contrary, that is, Ignorance
   and Folly, which is among all Men very dishonourable and reproachful;
   insomuch, that Men abhor nothing more than the imputation of Folly;
   esteeming it a greater disgrace to be accounted Fools, than to be
   accounted vicious; though indeed wicked Men be the greatest Fools, and
   on the contrary, godly Men the only wise Men.

   Here I cannot but wonder, that there should be such an unsatiable
   thirst after Honour, implanted in the nature of Man: Why Men should be
   so jealous of losing the reputation of any new Invention; so troubled
   and disturbed at having any of their Observations or Discoveries,
   though by themselves communicated to others, published without an
   honourable mention of them; so nettled at the discovery of any mistaken
   in their Writings, though but Grammatical; and being upbraided with it,
   why they should be willing to accept of false honour and undue Praises:
   Why they should think it a great matter to be praised by ignorant
   Persons, and incompetent Judges for such Abilities and Gifts, as they
   are not conscious to themselves of; Doth praise add any thing to them
   of real good besides conceit?

   I cannot conceive any other reason than what I intimated before, that
   it might be a powerful spur to incite them to the practice and exercise
   of religious and virtuous Actions; If it be objected that Men are as
   jealous of their Reputation in point of Knowledge, as they are in point
   of Virtue; I answer, It is an error, and a fault, and they ought not to
   be so; though for the reasons before alledged, I deny not Knowledge to
   be an excellent quality, which enlarges and advances the Understanding,
   and renders a Man capable of greater Employments, and doing more good
   than others of inferior Abilities, and Improvements.

   And further, that it is not Virtue alone to which Honour is due; as
   appears in that we are commanded to honour Parents, Magistrates,
   Ministers in general, as such, without any restriction or exception of
   those that are vicious. It is enough that they have an Authority
   derived from God, and a kind of divine Impress and Character upon them,
   to make them venerable.

CHAP. X.

   Of Friends.

   Sixthly,

   Friends are no small comfort and addition to our Happiness or
   Well-being in this World: Scarce any outward Blessing is so desirable,
   useful, and beneficial as Friendship. Cicero saith, Non aquâ non igni
   pluribus in locis utimur quàm amicitiâ: We have not more frequent use
   of Fire and Water, than we have of Friendship. Nothing so agreeable to
   Nature as it, (saith the same Author) nothing thing so convenient
   either for Prosperity, or Adversity: Nothing more pleasant and
   delightful than the sincere love and affection of a Faithful Friend,
   and reciprocal love of him; nothing more acceptable than his Society
   and Converse.

   But besides the pleasure and delight which Friendship affords us, we
   reap many and great Benefits from it. As,

   1. Faithful Counsel and Advice, which is of great moment in any
   doubtful Matter; it being true, Plus vident oculi quàm oculus: Many
   Eyes see more than one: Or any Matter of weighty concernment, wherein
   it is not safe to trust to our own Judgments, Prov. 27. 9. Ointment and
   perfume rejoice the heart; so doth the sweetness of a man's friend by
   hearty counsel. How great comfort must it needs be to have one whom we
   may securely unbosom our selves to, and trust with a Secret? to whom we
   may open our Griefs? disburthen our Minds, and so find ease and relief?

   2. Seasonable Reproof: This (saith the Author of the Whole Duty of Man)
   is of all others the most peculiar Duty of a Friend. I might add, the
   greatest benefit he can bestow upon his Friend, it being indeed that
   which none else is qualified for. Such an unwillingness there is in
   most Men to hear of their faults, that those that undertake that Work,
   had need have a great prepossession of their Hearts to make them
   patient of it. Of the absurdity and unreasonableness of this
   unwillingness to be reproved, Cicero saith very well, Atque illud
   absurdum est, quod ii qui monentur, eam molestiam quam debent capere
   non capiunt, eam capiuns quâ debent carere. Peccâsse enim se non
   anguntur, objurgari molestè ferunt: Quod contrà oportebat, delicto
   dolere, objurgatione gaudere. It is absurd, that they which are
   admonished receive not thence the trouble which they ought to have, but
   that which they ought to want. For they are not sorry that they have
   finned, but they take it ill that they are reproved. Whereas on the
   contrary they ought to grieve for their Offence, but rejoice for their
   Reproof.

   3. Condolence and Consolation in any Adversity, Affliction, or
   Suffering; as Sickness, the Death of any near Relation or Friend, loss
   of Worldly Goods by Fire, Shipwrack, Inundation, Invasion of Enemies,
   or the like. He that condoles with his Friend in such Accidents, doth
   as it were bear part of his Burthen, and by consolatory Considerations
   strengthens his Spirit, and enables him to support it. And there is
   great need of this to some Natures, which otherwise are in danger to be
   oppressed and overwhelmed with Grief, and even distracted by such
   Calamities.

   4. Relief and Supply of Want in case of Poverty and Necessity; a true
   Friend as well as a Brother is born for adversity, and will rather
   rejoice in contributing liberally to the support of his Friend, than
   desert him, or deny his assistance. In this case Friends may be a snare
   to us, tempting us to put our confidence in Man rather than God, and to
   think our Security greater in the multitude of Friends, than the
   providence and protection of God.

   5. Prayers to God for us, recommending us to him for all Blessings,
   both Spiritual and Temporal.

   Now all true Friendship is grounded upon Virtue: Virtus amicitiam &
   gignit & continet, nec sine virtute Amicitiâ ullo pacto esse potest,
   Cic. de Amicitia. Virtue doth both beget and maintain Friendship; nor
   can there possibly be any Friendship without Virtue. True Friends are
   such as sincerely desire and endeavour each others real good, both
   spiritual and temporal; but such friendship cannot be contracted and
   continued but only between persons truly religious, that love and fear
   God. We cannot expect fidelity and the benefits before recited from any
   but those who are so qualified: And those that are so, their friendship
   is courted by all Men, and who so happy as they that can get an
   interest in it!
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAP. XI.

   Of the Happiness of the Inward Man.

   I Proceed now to treat of the Happiness of the Inner Man, the Soul or
   Spirit, and that consists in the love of God, and of our Neighbour;
   whatever makes the Soul happy, must be suitable and agreeable to the
   Nature of it. Now the Soul is a spiritual substance, and therefore its
   Objective Happiness must be so too. The Soul is immortal, and therefore
   the Object which makes it happy must be of eternal duration. The
   desires of the Soul are very vast and extensive; nay, infinite; and
   therefore not to be satisfied but by an Infinite Good.

   From the Love of God flows an universal Obedience to all his holy
   Commandments, John 14. 13. If a man love me, he will keep my words. It
   is the nature of love to desire and endeavour to please and gratifie
   the Party beloved: And therefore he that loves God will labour to
   please him, by doing those things that are acceptable to him, and right
   in his fight. The Love of God will add Wings to his Soul, and constrain
   him to run the ways of his Commandments, which will no longer seem
   grievous or burthensome to him, but pleasant and delightful; yea,
   eligible, were they proposed to his choice in competition with the
   short and unsatisfactory Pleasures of Sin.

   Now Holiness of Life, and Obedience to the Commandments of God, hath
   the promises of all good things both for the Soul and Body; for this
   Life, and a better, Psal. 84. 11. He will give grace and glory, and no
   good thing will he withhold from them that live uprightly. Psal. 34.
   10. They that fear the Lord shall not want any good thing. Rom. 8. 28.
   We know that all things work together for good to them that love God. 1
   Tim. 4. 8. Godliness is profitable to all things, having the promises
   of the Life, that now is, and of that which is to come.

   Moreover those that love God, cannot but be happy, because they that
   love him, shall be beloved of him, both of the Father, and of the Son,
   John 14. 21. He that loveth me, shall be beloved of my Father , and I
   will love him, and manifest my self to him. And again, V. 25. If a man
   love me, my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our
   abode with him. God is the fountain of Happiness; whatever good is in
   the Creature, it came from him, and is but a Beam of his Light:
   Whatever is in the Creature in a limited, restrained, imperfect manner?
   is in him without limitation, without restriction, without
   imperfection. He both can and will make them whom he loves as happy as
   they are capable of being. God is the only Object: that deserves the
   highest degree of our Love, and he requires it: And therefore it is as
   well against our Duty as our Interest to deny it.

   As for the Love of our Neighbour, that is commanded us by God, Levit.
   19. 18. Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self, repeated Matt. xx.
   9. 1 John 4. 21. And this Commandment have we from him, that he who
   loveth God, love his Brother also. From this immediately flows the
   performance of the Duties of the Second Table. That great Rule of doing
   to others as we would they should do to us in like case; and the
   contrary of not doing to others that we would not should be done to us,
   are necessary consequences of loving our Neighbour as our selves. If we
   loved him as our selves, we would wish him as much good, and do him as
   much good as we do to our selves. We would willingly that other Men
   should do their Duties to us, shew us all kindness, and be helpful and
   beneficial to us in all our Wants and Necessities; and why? because we
   love our selves. Had we the same love to them, it would have the same
   effects. We would do the same good to them, that we desire from them.
   To instance in the particular Commands:

   Children, Subjects and Inferiors would yield to their Parents,
   Magistrates and Superiors, all that. Honour, Reverence and Obedience,
   which themselves would expect and desire from their Inferiors, were
   they in the same Relations and Circumstances.

   No Man would willingly have his own Body killed, or wounded, or any way
   tormented and put to pain; because no Man ever yet hated his own flesh,
   but nourisheth and cherisheth it, as the [12] Apostle speaks. Did he
   then love his Neighbour as himself, he would be so far from injuring
   him in that kind, that he would not suffer others to do so, if he could
   help it.

   Every Man is jealous of the Loyalty of his Wife, and impatient of
   having his Enclosure invaded, and made common, because he sets a high
   value on her Love and Fidelity, and looks upon it as a great dishonour,
   as well as an injury done him, to be robbed of it. Think we then he
   would offer such an abuse and wrong to his Neighbour, did he love him
   as himself, and were as tender of his Reputation as his own.

   Did Men love their Neighbours as themselves, there would be no need of
   Locks and Bars to secure their Goods from rapine and surreptions by
   Thieves and Robbers, because there would be no such; so that every Man
   might lie down securely, and there would be none to make him afraid:
   Love is so far from invading another's right, that it is liberal and
   communicative, and willing rather to part, with its own.

   The like, if it were needful, might easily be shewn in, the rest of the
   Commandments relating to our Neighbour.

   It remains now that we speak of the Effects and Consequents of a Holy
   Life upon the Soul or Inward Man.

   They are,

   I. The regulating and exalting of our Faculties, and inabling them for
   their proper Functions.

   II. The Peace, Tranquillity and Joy attendant to, and consequent
   thereupon.

   I. As for the regulating and exalting of our Faculties, they are, 1.
   The Understanding. 2. The Will. 3. The Affections.

   1. The Understanding: As Sin and Vice do stupifie and blind it, and
   disable it to judge aright; so the Commandments of God when obeyed do
   enlighten it, and enable it to discern and approve things that are
   excellent, Psalm 119. 98. Thou through thy Commandments hast made me
   wiser than mine enemies; for they are ever with me, V. 99. I have more
   understanding than all my teachers; for thy testimonies are my
   meditation. V. 100. I understand more than the ancients, because I keep
   thy precepts. Psalm 111. 10. A good understanding have all they that do
   his Commandments.

   2. The Will: The Perfection whereof consists in a perfect resignation
   to the Will of God; and true liberty, that is, freedom from the Bondage
   of Sin and Corruption, from the slavery of Satan, from the dominion of
   every vile Affection.

   Wicked Men are real Slaves and Vassals to their Lusts: This the very
   Heathen acknowledged; as Cicero and Horace, Juvenal, Persius, and
   others.

   From this Bondage the Son of God delivers us, John 8. 34. Our Saviour
   saith, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. And V. 36. If
   the son therefore shall make you free, ye shalt be free indeed.

   3 . The Affections or Passions: The Law of God requires and commands us
   to moderate and rule them, to place them upon their proper Objects, and
   to keep them within their due bounds; and good reason there is we
   should hold a strict hand over them: Animum rege, qui nisi paret
   imperat. If they be given way to, and the Bridle let loose, they become
   the great disturbers of Mens peace, quiet, and tranquillity; Anger,
   Hatred, Envy, &c. What storms and tumults do they raise in the Breast?
   What Mischievous Imaginations do they excite? What plotting, and
   counterplotting of revenge? Breaking out many times into railings,
   revilings, opprobrious Language, bitter Curses and Execrations: they
   toss the Mind to and fro, as contrary Winds do the Sea, causing it to
   cast up Mire and Dirt.

   On the contrary; where the Passions are duly governed and moderated,
   kept within their proper bounds and chanels, the Soul is calm and
   serene, and fit for any Employment or Exercise civil or religious.

   II. The Happiness of the Inward Man consists in that peace, joy and
   tranquillity that is attendant upon, or consequent to our obedience to
   God's Commands.

   1. Pleasure and Delight attends the performance of our Duties. Virtuous
   and pious Actions are agreeable to the Nature and Inclinations of good
   Men: It is as grateful and pleasing to a good Man to do good, as to an
   hungry Man to eat, or a thirsty Man to drink. It is as great a
   satisfaction to his rational Inclinations, as those other are to the
   sensual Appetites. Nothing can be more delightful and welcome to a
   generous Mind, than an opportunity of shewing it self grateful, to
   Parents, Friends and Benefactors, and making ample returns to those by
   whom he hath been obliged for the favours received: Nothing more
   acceptable than to be employed in worthy Actions, especially such as
   tend to promote publick good, the peace and prosperity of our Country,
   or Mankind in general The Heathen Poet could say,

   Dulce & decorum est pro Patriâ mori.

   It is a sweet and comely thing even to die for ones Country: Which yet
   I suppose is too high a flight or pitch of Charity for a Heathen to
   attain to; and that there must be something of glory to carry them so
   far. To overcome evil with good, and return Kindnesses instead of
   Injuries, thereby melting the Hearts of our Enemies, and making them
   our Friends, is certainly a more pleasant thing, and much more for our
   peace and ease, than revenging our selves of them. To return good for
   evil is a Godlike quality; our Saviour commanding us to love our
   enemies, and do good to them that hate us, &c. to engage us thereto,
   proposes God's Example; who causes his sun to shine on the evil, and on
   the good; and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. Who is kind
   unto the unthankful and the evil. Cicero in his Gratulatory Oration to
   Cæsar for M. Marcellus, makes him that forgives Enemies, and restores
   them to their former Dignities, like to God: Non ego illum summis viris
   comparo, sed Deo similem judico.

   2. Peace and Joy, and confidence towards God is a necessary consequent
   of Obedience to his Commandments, 1 John 3. 21. If our hearts condemn
   us not, then have we confidence towards God; and whatsoever we ask, we
   receive of him, because we keep his Commandments, and do those things
   that are pleasing in his sight. Delight and Pleasure, and satisfaction
   of Mind, inward Peace and Tranquillity naturally follow religious
   Actions: When a Man hath done his Duty, and spent his time well, he can
   reflect upon his doings with comfort; he is not afraid to review his
   Life past, and call himself to an account for what he hath done; Res
   severa est verum gaudium, saith Seneca: Unde sit interrogas? dicam; ex
   bonâ conscientiâ, ex honestis consiliis, ex rectis actionibus: True joy
   is a severe thing: Do you ask whence it comes? I'll tell you; from a
   good Conscience, from honest Counsels, from just Actions. A good
   Conscience is said to be a continual Feast: The Poet resembles it to a
   brazen Wall, which secures the Soul from all inward Trouble and
   Disquiet, Fear and Terror.

     --Hic murus aheneus esto,
     Nil conscire sibi, nullâ pallesere culpâ.

   I shall conclude this Particular with the Words of Dr. Wilkins, Bishop
   of Chester, the most rational, solid, sublime, compleat, durable
   Delights of all others do flow from the Conscience of well-doing. 'Tis
   a chief part this, of that Heaven we enjoy upon Earth; and it is a
   principal part of that Happiness which we hope to enjoy in Heaven; next
   to the Beatifical Vision and Fruition of God, is the Happiness of a
   good Conscience, and next to that, the Society of Saints and Angels,
   Solomon saith of Wisdom, that is the fear of God, Her ways are ways of
   pleasantness, and all her paths are peace, Prov. 3. 17. Peace internal,
   Peace external, Peace eternal: Peace with our selves; Peace with Men;
   Peace with God; as I have heard a Reverend Divine distinguish it.

   On the other side, no Man can be happy that keeps not a good
   Conscience: But without Holiness of Life, and Obedience to God's
   Commandments, a good Conscience cannot be kept, Esay 57. 21. There is
   no peace to the wicked, saith my God. Guilt is an obligation to
   Punishment; but an obligation to Punishment infers an expectation of
   it; and whosoever expects it, doth really suffer it: as Seneca
   excellently, Dat poenas quisquis expectat; quisquis autem meruit,
   expectat: That man doth really suffer punishment, who expects it: But
   whosoever hath deserved it, expects it. Were it not for diversion, and
   non-attendance to his Condition, a wicked Man would carry a continual
   Hell in his Breast; there is therefore (as I have noted elsewhere) but
   a thought's distance between him and Hell: His only security is in
   being a stranger to himself. This, (one would think) should be the most
   powerful curb imaginable to restrain Men from Sin, and the most
   effectual Persuasive in the World to a holy Life; That those that live
   in Sin cannot think upon their Condition without fear and disquiet;
   especially those who are guilty of secret Crimes, who are liable to
   those more severe Lashes, and affrighting Rebukes of Conscience. These
   Men are not able to hear such Sins reproved without blushing and
   confusion, and inward trouble of Mind;

     --Rubet Auditor cui frigida mens est
     Crimmibus, tacitâ sudant præcordia culpâ.

     --He whose Spirits feel
     Cold guilt, his Crimes laid open,

     Blushing hears
      His conscious Intrails sweat.

   Nay, sometimes they are in such distress, as to be a burthen to
   themselves, as holy Job [13] speaks, and weary of their very Beings, so
   as to chuse Strangling rather than Life; or else to be their own
   delators, and publish their guilt. God hath implanted in our Natures
   (as I noted before) an aversation from, and dislike of Sin: The Reason
   of Man cannot be reconciled to it, but must needs disapprove and
   condemn it. We know (as the Apostle speaks, Rom. 7.) that the Law and
   Commandment of God is holy, and just, and good; and therefore he that
   lives in Sin, is a self-condemned Person, and can have no inward Peace,
   You will object, Consuetudo peccandi tollit sensum peccati: The Custom
   of Sinning takes away the sense of Sin: And some Men have their
   Consciences cauterized, being past feeling, and go on securely in their
   vicious Courses without check or remorse. I answer, That such Men
   indeed, who long resist the Grace of God, he is pleased at last to
   withdraw it from them, and give them up to a reprobate Mind, to do
   things not convenient; yet is not their condition the better for this;
   But this senselesness or stupidity is a more dangerous and incurable
   Disease, answering to a Lethargy, or Apoplexy in the Body.

   Neither yet do the Troubles of Mind arismg from in evil Conscience,
   determine in Death, but continue for ever. This is that Worm which
   dieth not; a sad reflection upon our own desperate madness and folly in
   leading such wicked Lives, as have brought this Misery upon us; and a
   perpetual indignation against, and condemnation of our selves.

   I have often wondred that the very Heathens, who had no clear
   Revelation of a future Estate after this Life ended, nor any more than
   an ancient Tradition of Rewards and Punishments then to be received or
   suffered, accordingly as Men had lived virtuous or wicked Lives should
   be so terrified with a sense of guilt; and that the consciousness of
   secret Crimes should be so grievous and insupportable to them, arming
   their Minds against themselves and making them their own Tormentors, as
   the Poet expresses it,

     --Quos diri conscia facti
     Mens habet attonitos, & surdo verbere cædit,
     Occultum quatiente animo tortore flagellum.

   I cannot but think that this great terrour and anxiety of Mind
   attending the consciousness of any heinous Sin, is more than the effect
   of an expedition of punishment, grounded only upon an ancient
   Tradition; but that the sense of a connexion between Sin and Punishment
   is deeply imprinted upon the Soul of Man, by the Finger of God; and is
   one great Argument of the existence of a Deity.

   Against what we have said concerning the Happiness that attends the
   godly in this present State, it may be objected: Is it not said in
   Scripture, Psal. 34. 19. Many are the afflictions of the righteous. And
   do we not read in the Hebrews, Chap. 11. 37. of some who had trial of
   bonds and imprisonments, who were stoned, sawn in sunder, tempted,
   slain with the sword, wandred about in Sheeps-skins and Goats-skins,
   being destitute, afflicted, tormented, of whom the world was not
   worthy. And doth not the Apostle say, 1 Cor. 15. 19. If in this life
   only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. And 2
   Tim. 3. 12. All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
   persecution.

   To all this I answer, that we speak according to the natural and usual
   course of things. But there are some exceptions from general Rules,
   peculiar and exempt Cases; some righteous persons, whom for weighty and
   wise Reasons God is pleased to permit to be exercised with great and
   sore Afflictions and Distresses; either perhaps to manifest his own
   Power in supporting them; or to set them forth as illustrious Examples
   of Fortitude, Faith and Patience. Did not righteous Men sometimes
   conflict with adversity and Misery, there would be no use of such a
   Grace as Patience; nay, it could not be known that there were any such;
   or, to enhance their future reward. The Martyrs who seal the Truth with
   their Blood, shall in the judgment of Divines, be advanced to a higher
   degree of Glory than ordinary Christians, and be crowned with Aureolæ
   suitable to their deserts.

   But those two latter places of the Apostle are to be understood of the
   Primitive Times of Christianity, when all the Powers of the World were
   Heathen; when God was pleased to make use of the Sufferings of the
   Professors of it to propagate the Gospel, after a strange and wonderful
   manner: So that Sanguis Martyrum was said to be Semen Ecclesiæ, the
   Blood of Martyrs, the Seed of the Church. But now since the publick
   reception and acknowledgment of the Truth: Since Kings have become
   nursing Fathers, and Queens nursing Mothers to the Church: The case is
   altered, and Religion instead of exposing its Professors to Sufferings,
   doth rather promote their Worldly Interest.

   Those Afflictions which God is pleased to lay upon his Children and
   Servants as fatherly Corrections for their Miscarriages, serving as
   Physick to purge out the Reliques of Corruption, and to embitter Sin to
   them, and quicken them to the performance of their Duty; are no
   prejudice to our Assertion, because we bring them upon our selves by
   own default; and 'tis not holiness of Life, but the want of it, and
   neglect of our Duties, which is always the procuring, and often the
   productive cause of them. For God doth not willingly afflict nor grieve
   the Children of men, Lament. 3. 33. Here we may note the great
   imperfection of the Love of God even in the bell Men, Afflictions being
   oftentimes a more powerful Curb to restrain them from the commission of
   Sin; and a more effectual Spur to quicken them to Duty, than the Love
   of God; as we see in David, the Man after God's own heart, Psal. 119.

CHAP. XII.

   Of the Happiness of the Future Estate, or of Eternal Life.

   IT remains that we say something concerning the Happiness of the Future
   Estate after this Life is ended.

   The Happiness of this Estate is called Eternal Life, and consists in
   the Knowledge and Love of God, and his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, and
   the joy and delectation that necessarily results therefrom, John 17. 3.
   And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God,
   and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent. That is, know thee to be their
   God, know thee so as to love thee. Knowledge alone is not sufficient to
   make us happy; the lapsed Angels know the Excellencies and Perfections
   of the Divine Nature, but yet they are never the more happy for that
   Knowledge, because they have no interest in God, nor are like to reap
   any benefit or advantage by what they know of him. So in Men here in
   this World, Virtue and Knowledge may be separated: A knowing Man may be
   a vicious Man, and consequently unhappy. Again, Knowledge of the
   Mysteries of Nature, and the Works of God, though there be in Man an
   eager third after it, and some Pleasure in obtaining it: yet if it
   terminates only in Knowledge, and be directed to no further end, it
   doth not contribute much to our Happiness. It is a known saying,

   Scire tuum nihil est nisi te scire hoc sciat alter;

   And truly I am apt to think there may be something of truth in it.
   Those Men that exercise their Wits in curious Mathematical
   Speculations, could they be allured that their Inventions and
   Discoveries should never come to the knowledge of any Creature but
   themselves, I doubt whether the pleasure of the Intention, would in
   their own esteem compensate the labor and toil of the Inquisition. But
   yet even in this State thus much may be said in commendation of
   Knowledge; that it doth advance and enlarge the Understanding, and
   render the Soul capable of a greater degree of Happiness, as I have
   said before.

   But in the World to come the Vision of God cannot be separated from his
   Love. Such a knowledge of God will transform the blessed Souls to whom
   it shall be communicated into his holy Image; We shall be like him
   (saith the Apostle) for we shall see him as he is. None shall be
   admitted to this sight, but those that are pure in heart; Without
   holiness no man shall see God. And to these the clear understanding of
   all the Works of God, both of Creation and Providence, will stir up the
   most exalted Affections of Admiration, Love, and Joy.

   But I shall not proceed further in my own Words to describe the
   Happiness of a future Estate, or eternal Life, because I find it so
   fully and clearly done by the Right Reverend Dr. Patrick, now Lord
   Bishop of Ely, in his Treatise of The Witnesses to Christianity, Part
   2^d. that I have nothing material to add to it. Therefore I shall
   transcribe thence what he hath concerning the Love of God; for the rest
   referring the Reader to the Book it self.

   And if (saith he) the Nature of this Life be further examined, you will
   find the Mind [of which he had spoken before] is not the only Faculty
   that shall be gratified, but the Will shall conceive a Love as great as
   the Knowledge of which I have discoursed. For as God is the highest
   Object of the Understanding, being the prime Truth, so he is the
   chiefest Object of the Will, being the first and best Good. And
   therefore as the Understanding then shall most clearly know him, so the
   Will in like manner shall most ardently love him, and find perfect
   satisfaction in that Love. There is a necessary connexion between these
   things, and it cannot be otherwise, but that from the best Good clearly
   known there will flow the greatest Love, drawing along with it the
   greatest delight, and the most perfect repose. And therefore to see God
   contains in its Notion both Love and Delectation, with Rest, and
   Satisfaction, Love naturally flows from thence, as from its Fountain;
   and the other naturally flow from Love, which is the highest Act of
   that Faculty which we call the Will, as knowing and contemplating is of
   the Understanding. Desire indeed is the first motion of it, when any
   thing is apprehended to be good for us; but that will there be quenched
   in possession and enjoyment, and no more of it can be conceived to
   remain than a longing for the continuance and increase of this
   Happiness, which yet will be so certain, that we shall be rather
   confident than desirous.

   The Will therefore having such a glorious Object always before it, will
   be wholly employed in Love, and spend it self without any decay in
   flames of affection towards this universal Good, which shines so fairly
   and brightly in its Eyes. It will apply it self to the enjoyment of it,
   with as great a vehemency as it can; and laying its Mouth (as St.
   Augustin teaches me to speak ) to the Spring of all Happiness, do more
   than taste the sweetness of it: We; may expect to have it fill'd with
   those delicious Pleasures which we know attend on Love, and which in
   that State will be proportionable to the greatness of the good that is
   embraced, and to the strength and Ardency of the embracement.

   And whereas, here in this World, Men are apt to love beyond all reason,
   whereby their Love becomes adulterate, and is mix'd with so many
   discontents, that it proves but a bitter sweet; there our Understanding
   will be in its full growth, and highest pitch; so that as nothing which
   is reasonable shall be omitted to be done; nothing likewise (hall be
   done that is unreasonable: This Love will be grounded upon the cleared
   Judgment; this Flame kindled by the purest Light; so that there shall
   be no trouble or disquiet in it, but perfect rest and peace.

   And whereas in this World, Mens Affections flow to things that are not
   near so big as themselves (i.e. as their own Desires) and so they
   languish, and faint, and fall sick; even in the enjoyment of the best
   good it affords, because they find it is not a supply proportionable to
   their want, or to their expectation: There will be no such emptiness,
   or want of satisfaction in those Coelestial Enjoyments; because we
   shall embrace not only our proper good, but that which is commensurate
   to our desires, and beyond our hopes: Our Affections will not fall then
   upon that which cannot sustain the whole weight of them; but feeling
   themselves born up to the greatest height of Love, by a good so full,
   that it will leave no room for complaint or uneasiness, they will enjoy
   the most solid rest and satisfaction.

   Do but conceive them in your Minds, what a pleasure it is, here in this
   Life, to love, and to be beloved; and you will have some notion whereby
   to take a measure of the Life we are speaking of, which will consist in
   such mutual Love, and delightful correspondencies. And they who have
   neither Father nor Mother, Wife nor Children, near Kindred, nor
   Relations, whereon to place their Affection, let them consider, if they
   have but a singular Friend, what the pleasure is that two persons, who
   sincerely and purely love, take in the sweet Company and Conversation
   of each other. Or if I must suppose any Man to be so unkind and so
   unhappy, as to have no love for any body but his own self, let him
   think what contentment he hath, and how he is pleased if he can arrive
   any thing near to a quiet enjoyment of his dear self. And such a
   delightful state may be a small Image of Heaven, where holy Souls will
   love God with a far greater flame than ever they did (or shall then)
   love themselves; because he will appear infinitely more lovely, and to
   bear also a far greater love to them, than it is possible for them to
   do to themselves.

   Now none can tell how transporting it will be to a good Soul, when it
   feels it self the beloved of God, as well as full of love to him;
   because we cannot think how great the Love of the Almighty is, unless
   we could know how great he is himself. This is a thing that cannot fail
   to have a strange power over our affections, and to matter them; so
   that we shall be quite taken out of our selves, for we all extremely
   love to be beloved.

   If any Neighbour (hews us an unexpected and undeserved Kindness, we are
   apt to think he is the best person in the World: and the poorest wretch
   in the World, if we see in him the undoubted signs of an hearty love to
   us, we cannot chuse but requite it with some Expressions of kindness
   back again; nay if a Dog, or such a dumb Creature do but fawn upon us,
   or delight in our Company, and with a great deal of observance follow
   us wheresoever we go, we cannot but be so far pleased with his
   inclination towards us, as to make much of it, and to be troubled to
   see any harm befall it, and to love to see it play, and be well
   pleased. Judge then what a pleasure it will be to pious Souls to find
   themselves beloved of him, who hath put these kind Resentments into our
   Natures. To what an height will the sweet breathings of his Love blow
   up the Flames of theirs? Into what Extasies will they fall, when they
   feel by the happy fruits what an exceeding great affection their
   heavenly Father bears to them? It is above our present thoughts to
   apprehend the Joy that will then overflow them: But we may conceive a
   little of it, if we remember, that God is love, and that by our Love he
   will be in us, and by his Love we shall be in him.

   He proceeds to speak of the love of Saints and Angels: The pleasure,
   joy, and delegation that naturally and necessarily flows from this
   knowledge and love of God, the Happiness which the Body shall be
   exalted to, and the eternal duration of all these.

   This Eternal Life our Blessed Saviour hath brought to light through the
   Gospel, and hath promised to all those who by patient continuance in
   well doing seek for glory, and honour, and immortality, Rom. 2. 7. And
   this is the promise that he hath promised, even eternal life, 1 John 2.
   25.

   Some perchance may say, The great disproportion that is between the
   Services and Rewards makes this Promise of Eternal Life difficult to be
   believ'd: For who can think that God should recompense our poor and
   imperfect Duties and Services, performed for a very short time, with
   such ap immense and eternal weight of Glory and Happiness?

   To this I answer; That though indeed it cannot consist with God's
   Justice to punish any Creature without, or beyond its demerit; yet
   nothing hinders but that he may be as bountiful as he pleases, and in
   his Rewards exceed all the deserts, and even expectations of his
   Creatures, an hundred or a thousand fold.

   Let us then admire the transcendent and unmerited goodness and love of
   God, in doing such great things for us, as fending his Son into the
   World to take our nature upon him, to suffer Death for our Sins, and to
   give us the great Promise of Eternal Life; and let us endeavour in some
   measure to answer this Love by suitable Affections of the most ardent
   Love and Gratitude.

   Let us also love the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity, which we have all
   the reason in the World to do, considering the greatness of his Love to
   us manifested by the great things he hath done and suffered for us,
   John 15. 9. As the Father hath loved me (saith our Saviour to his
   Disciples) so have I loved you. And V. 13. he proceeds to say, Greater
   love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his
   Friends. Ye are my Friends, &c. By which Words he intimates, that he
   was about to make the greatest demonstration of his Love to his
   Apostles, and to all true Believers, by laying down his Life for them.
   The Apostle Paul carries this yet higher, Rom. 5. 7, 8. For scarce for
   a righteous man will one die; yet, peradventure for a good man some
   would even dare to die. But God commendeth his love towards us, in that
   while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. This exceeds the highest
   degree of love Man ever attained to, Ephes. 5. 2. As Christ also hath
   loved us, and given himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God
   for a sweet smelling favour. Phil. 2. 6, 7, 8. Who being in the form of
   God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God; but made himself of
   no reputation, and took upon him the form of a Servant, and was made in
   the likeness of man. And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled
   himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross.
   That the Eternal Son of God, equal with his Father, should so highly
   advance our Nature, as to unite it to the Divine in one Person, that so
   he might be qualified by the Sacrifice of himself to expiate our Sins,
   to make an atonement for us, and to reconcile us unto God: The
   greatness of this Love, together with the freeness and unmeritedness of
   it, there being not any the lead Motive on our part to invite him to
   it, is so matchless and stupendious, that it challenges the highest
   degree of reciprocal affection and gratitude. Magnes amoris amor; Love
   is the Loadstone of Love. We cannot chuse but love them again, in whom
   we discern any Expressions of unfeigned love to us, as I have before
   noted: And our love for the degree of it mull be in some measure
   answerable to the Dignity, and to the merit of the Person who loveth
   us: For Favours done us, and benefits bestowed upon us, Gratitude is
   the moll natural, I might say, necessary ebullition of of the Mind of
   Man.

   To this purpose Seneca, Epist. 81. In hoc fidei populi credamus, Nihil
   esse grato animo honestius. Omnes hoc urbes, omnes etiam ex Barbaris
   regionibus gentes conclamabunt: In hoc bonis malisque conveniet. Erunt
   qui voluptates laudent, erunt qui labores malint, erunt qui dolorem
   maximum malum dicant, erunt qui ne malum quidem appellent; Divitias
   aliquis ad summum bonum admittet; alius illas dicet humanæ malo vitæ
   repertas, nihil esse eo locupletius, cui quod donet, Fortuna non
   invenit. In tantâ judiciorum diversitate, referendam benè merentibus
   gratiam omnes uno tibi, quod aiunt, ore affirmabunt; in hoc tam discors
   turba consentiet.

   "In this let us believe what People generally agree in, That there is
   nothing more honest and commendable than a grateful Mind. All Cities,
   all Nations, even of Barbarous Countries; all Men, both good and bad,
   consent in this. There are some who commend Pleasures; others prefer
   Labours: Some there be, who say that pain is the greatest Evil; others,
   who will not grant it to be any Evil at all: One will admit Riches to
   be the chiefest good; another affirms them to be the Mischief of human
   Life; and that none can be richer than he upon whom Fortune cannot find
   any thing which she may bestow. In such a diversity of Judgments about
   other things, that thanks are to be returned to those who have deserv'd
   well of us, all with one Mouth affirm: In this these Dissenting Parties
   are all agreed."

   We are by Nature inclined to requite kindnesses; non docti sed facti,
   non instituti sed imbuti sumus: And if we cannot do that, to retain, at
   least, a grateful sense and memory of them, and upon all occasions to
   acknowledge our obligations to such Benefactors, as we are not able to
   recompense, to honour and love them, and to do all we can to please and
   gratifie them. Ingratum si dixeris, omnia dixeris: You cannot say worse
   of a Man, than that he is ungrateful; Ingratitude being an unnatural
   Sin. Seeing then we cannot requite this transcendent kindness of our
   Saviour to us, nor make him any amends for that great Salvation he hath
   wrought for us, and those inestimable Benefits he hath bestowed on us,
   let us not be wanting to dc/ what in us lies, to express our gratitude,
   by acknowledging, and celebrating his goodness to us, and the great
   things he hath done for us, singing with the holy Psalmist, [14] Bless
   the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me bless his holy name.
   Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits. And by
   devoting our selves to his Service, and doing always those things which
   are pleasing and acceptable to him. Let his love constrain us not to
   live any longer to our selves, but unto him who hath died for us, and
   rose again, 1 Cor. 5. 16. Who hath redeemed us to God by his blood,
   Revel. 5. 9. And made us Kings and Priests unto our God. Let us have a
   care that we do not frustrate the Grace of God, as to our selves, and
   render this great undertaking of our Saviour in vain to us; nay, an
   aggravation of our Condemnation: For how shall we escape, if we neglect
   so great salvation? As the Apostle speaks, Heb. 2. 3.

   Let not the difficulty of obeying God's Commandments, and leading a
   holy life, deter or discourage us from endeavouring it: We know that
   neither Learning nor Riches, nor any thing that is excellent is to be
   obtained without pains-taking. Now nothing so excellent, so desirable,
   so worthy our utmost endeavors as Eternal Life; this will abundantly
   recompense all our labour and travel; nay, though we were put to suffer
   Persecution, Imprisonment, or even Death it self, for Conscience sake,
   and bearing witness to the Truth, we should have no need to repent it:
   Our Reward shall be answerable to, nay far exceed our Work, 2 Cor. 4.
   17. Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a
   far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory.

   To sum up all in brief: Since then, 1. A Holy Life and Conversation
   here secures to us an interest in a Future State of Eternal Bliss and
   Happiness, Glory and Immortality in the World to come, and thereby
   delivers us from the fear of Death, that King of Terrors, as it is
   denominated, Job 18. 14. that phoberon phobero'taton, as Aristotle
   calls it, The most terrible of all terribles: Which the wisest
   Philosophers by all their Argumentations could never either arm others
   against, or secure themselves from the fear of; the very best of them,
   even Socrates himself being doubtful of the immortality of the Soul;
   our Saviour alone having brought life and immortality to light through
   the Gospel: Of which [Death] wicked Men cannot but have a dreadful
   apprehension, because of that indignation and wrath, tribulation and
   anguish, which is threatned against those who obey not the truth, but
   obey unrighteousness, Rom. 2. 8, 9.

   2. Since also it conduceth much to the well being and happiness of the
   outward and inward Man in this present Life, as I have endeavoured to
   demonstrate in this Discourse.

   Moreover (3.) Since this Holiness and Obedience is even in the
   judgment, and by the confession of vicious Persons themselves better
   and more eligible than the life they lead.

   And Lastly, Since it is more facile, easy and pleasant than the Slavery
   and Drudgery of Sin and Satan.

   Since, I say, all this is true and certain, surely it is the greatest
   folly and madness imaginable, for a little false and transient
   Pleasure, and to gratify some deceitful Lust, as the Apostle justly
   calls them, Ephes. 4. 22. to forego not only our hopes of that eternal
   Life and Happiness, which our Saviour hath purchased for us, and upon
   our Obedience promised to us, those sincere and solid Pleasures which
   are at God's right hand for evermore. Rev. 22. 14. our right to the
   Tree of Life, and of entring in through the Gates into the New
   Jerusalem; which is their portion who keep God's Commandments; but also
   that present comfort and satisfaction of mind, that inward peace and
   joy which attends the Conscience of well doing here.

   Mark what a [15] Heathen saith of these sensual Pleasures, Dimitte
   istas voluptates turbidas, magno luendas: non venturæ tantum, sed &
   præteritæ nocent. Quemadmodum scelera etiamsi non sint deprehensa cùm
   fierent, solicitudo non cum ipsis abit; ità voluptatum improbarum etiam
   post ipsas poenitentia est: Non sunt solidæ, non sunt fideles; etiamsi
   non nocent, fugiunt. Dismiss (saith he) these troubled, or muddy and
   impure pleasures, which you must pay dearly for; they are hurtful not
   only when they are coming, but when they are past: As crimes though
   undiscovered when they are committed, leave not the committers of them
   without solicitude, so Repentance always attends unlawful Pleasures:
   They are not solid they are false and deceitful, and though they were
   not hurtful, yet are they transient, only in motion, and suddainly
   gone.

   As for Riches or Honours, or any other worldly good, they are also
   unsatisfactory. We find our Expectations in the pursuit of them,
   frustrated in the acquisition and enjoyment; being presently full and
   weary of that, which we did most eagerly and impotently desire and long
   after.

   And yet were there never so much worth and goodness in them, they are,
   1. Uncertain, as the Apostle calls them, 1 Tim. 6. 17. they may be
   taken away from us before we die. 2, They are of short continuance; if
   they abide with us till death, we must then necessarily part with them:
   For as the same Apostle saith, V. 7th of the same Chapter, We brought
   nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.

  FINIS.
