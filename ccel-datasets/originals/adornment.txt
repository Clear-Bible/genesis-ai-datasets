                                  INTRODUCTION

   Jan van Ruysbroeck--three of whose most important works are here for
   the first time presented to English readers--is the greatest of the
   Flemish mystics, and must take high rank in any list of Christian
   contemplatives and saints. He was born in 1273, at the little village
   of Ruysbroeck or Ruusbroeck between Brussels and Hal, from which he
   takes his name; and spent his whole life within his native province of
   Brabant. At eleven years old, he is said to have run away from home and
   found his way to Brussels; where he was received by his uncle Jan
   Hinckaert, a canon of the Cathedral of St Gudule. Hinckaert, who was a
   man of great piety, lived with another devout priest named Francis van
   Coudenberg in the most austere fashion; entirely devoted to prayer and
   good works. The two ecclesiastics brought the boy up, and gave him a
   religious education, which evidently included considerable training in
   theology and philosophy: subjects for which he is said to have shown,
   even in boyhood, an astonishing aptitude. In 1317 he took orders, and
   obtained through his uncle's influence a prebend's stall in St Gudule;
   a position which he occupied for twenty-six years.

   During youth and early middle-age, then, Ruysbroeck lived in Brussels,
   fulfilling the ordinary duties of a cathedral chaplain: and here some
   of his earlier works may have been written. Here no doubt he developed
   that shrewd insight into human character to which his books bear
   witness; and here gained his experience of those "false mystics" and
   self-sufficient quietists so vividly described and sternly condemned in
   the second book of The Adornment of the Spiritual Marriage, in The Book
   of Truth, and other places. In the early fourteenth century a number of
   heretical sects, of which the Brethren of the Free Spirit were typical,
   flourished in the Low Countries. Basing their doctrine on a pantheistic
   and non-Christian conception of the Godhead, they proclaimed the
   "divinity of man," and preached a quietism of the most soul-destroying
   kind, together with an emancipation from the fetters of law and custom
   which often resulted in actual immorality. [1] As Ruysbroeck grew in
   knowledge of the true contemplative life, the dangers attending on its
   perversion became ever more clear to him: and he entered upon that
   vigorous campaign against the heretical quietists which was the chief
   outward event of his Brussels period.

   As to his spiritual development during these years, we can have no
   certain knowledge: since none of his works are exactly dated, and the
   order in which they should be arranged is a matter of inference. But it
   is inherently probable that he was experiencing the early stages of
   that mysterious growth of the soul which he describes so exactly in the
   first two books of The Adornment of the Spiritual Marriage: the hard
   self-discipline, the enlightenment, raptures, and derelictions, of the
   "active" and "interior" life. At this period, he had made little
   impression on his contemporaries. The Augustinian canon Pomerius, who
   had known in their old age some of Ruysbroeck's friends and followers,
   and who wrote his Life [2] in the year 1420, describes him as a simple,
   quiet, rather shabby-looking person, who "went about the streets of
   Brussels with his mind lifted up into God." Yet it is certain that
   great force of character, much shrewd common sense, and remarkable
   intellectual qualities lay behind this meek appearance. We know how
   greatly he disliked "singular conduct" in those who had given
   themselves to the spiritual life. They should be, he thought, like
   "other good men"; [3] and this ideal found expression in his own life.
   A devout and orthodox Catholic, well read in scholastic theology and
   philosophy, on the mental and social side at least, he was a thorough
   man of his time; apparently accepting without criticism its
   institutions and ideas. Many passages in his works indicate this: for
   instance, his constant and unquestioning use of the categories of
   mediaeval psychology, or his quiet assumption [4] that "putting to the
   torture" is part of the business of a righteous judge. But on the
   spiritual side his period influenced him little. There, his concern was
   with truths which lie, as he says, "outside Time" in the Eternal Now;
   and when he is trying to interpret these to us the Middle Ages and
   their limitations fall away. Then we catch fragments which Plato or
   Plotinus on one hand, Hegel on the other, might recognise as the
   reports of one who had known and experienced the Reality for which they
   sought. "My words," said Ruysbroeck, "are strange, but those who love
   will understand": and this indeed is true, for he possessed in an
   extraordinary degree the power--which so many great mystics have
   lacked--of giving verbal and artistic expression to his soaring
   intuitions of Eternity.

   In 1343, when he was fifty years old, the growing sense of contrast
   between those intuitions and the religious formalism and unreality of
   the cathedral life, the distracting bustle of the town, reached a point
   at which it seems to have become unendurable to him. Together with
   Hinckaert and Coudenberg--both now old men--he left Brussels for ever;
   all three intending to settle in some lonely country place, where they
   could devote themselves to the life of prayer and contemplation. They
   were given the old hermitage of Groenendael, or the Green Valley, in
   the forest of Soignes outside Brussels. There they were presently
   joined by disciples, and formed a small community, which was eventually
   placed under the rule of the Augustinian canons. Coudenberg became the
   provost and Ruysbroeck the prior; and under their government the priory
   of Groenendael soon became known as the home of a special holiness.

   We shall probably be right if we identify his thirty-eight years,
   sojourn in the forest with the "God-seeing" stage of Ruysbroeck's
   mystical life. [5] Here without doubt all his greatest works were
   written. The Adornment of the Spiritual Marriage must have been
   composed soon after his retreat from Brussels, for we know that in 1350
   he sent a copy of it to the group of Rhenish mystics who called
   themselves the Friends of God. The Sparkling Stone and The Book of
   Truth--both written at the request of friends, to explain difficult
   points in his earlier books--belong to a later date. We need not feel
   surprised that the full flowering of his genius should coincide with
   his abandonment of the world. In one form or another such abandonment
   has been found imperative by all the great explorers of Eternity; whose
   inward quest of the One nearly always entails some withdrawal from the
   multiplicity of things. But beyond this, there was in Ruysbroeck's
   mysticism--at once so intimate in its feeling so vast in its reach--a
   deeply poetic strain. The silence and growing beauty of the forest
   ministered to this: and many passages in his books show how easily he
   discovered intimations of divinity through the loving contemplation of
   natural things. A beautiful tradition tells us that he would go out
   alone into the woods when he felt that the inspiration of God was upon
   him; and there, sitting under his favourite tree, would write as the
   Holy Ghost dictated. The brethren used to declare that once, having
   been absent many hours from the priory, he was at last found in this
   place, rapt in ecstacy and surrounded by a brilliant aura of divine
   light--a legend which closely resembles many similar stories in the
   lives of the saints.

   Such ecstatic absorption in God, however, formed only one side of
   Ruysbroeck's religious life. True to his own doctrine of the "balanced
   career" of action and contemplation as the ideal of the Christian soul
   [6] his rapturous ascents towards Divine Reality were compensated by
   the eager and loving interest with which he turned towards the world of
   men. In the daily life of the priory he sought perpetually for
   opportunities of service, especially those of the most menial kind. As
   time passed, and his great mystical gifts became known, many disciples
   came to him: amongst them Gerard Groot, afterwards the founder of the
   Brothers of the Common Life and hence spiritual ancestor of Thomas ?
   Kempis. To all these he gave patient help and robust advice; initiating
   them, so far as it was possible, into the secrets of the true spiritual
   life, and ruthlessly exposing the pious pretensions of those who sought
   only a reputation for sanctity. It is clear even from his writings that
   he possessed to a remarkable degree the "gift of the discernment of
   spirits"--in other words, that his shrewd judgment of humanity seldom
   failed him. All know the story of the two priests, who came from Paris
   to ask his opinion of their spiritual state: merely to receive the
   truthful but disconcerting reply, "You are as holy as you wish to be!"

   The thirty-eight years which Ruysbroeck passed at Groenendael were,
   from the point of view of the earthly biographer, almost devoid of
   incident. True, he formed many friendships with the most spiritual men
   of his time, and seems occasionally to have left his priory in order to
   visit them. We possess a charming account of one such visit; that to
   Gerard Naghel, the Prior of Hérines, at whose suggestion The Book of
   Truth was written. "His peaceful and joyful countenance, his humble
   good-humoured speech," says Gerard, made him loved by all with whom he
   came into contact: a sentence which brings to mind Ruysbroeck's own
   picture of those happy men who walk in the way of love.


   "Those who follow the way of love

   Are the richest of all men living:

   They are bold, frank, and fearless,

   They have neither travail nor care,

   For the Holy Ghost bears all their burdens.

   They seek no outward seeming,

   They desire nought that is esteemed of men,

   They affect not singular conduct,

   They would be like other good men." [7]

   Further, he saw during these years the rapid growth of the
   community--now swiftly becoming one of the chief centres of spiritual
   life in the Low Countries--and the wide dissemination of his own works.
   He even lived to see certain passages in those works criticised, as
   supporting a pantheistic and heretical view of the union of the soul
   with God. The Book of Truth was written to refute this accusation. But
   the true events of these years took place for him in that supernal
   world of high contemplation which it was his special province to
   disclose to his fellow-men. There his real life was fixed. There his
   loving ardour was for ever young. Thither he drew those treasures of
   mystical knowledge which he is said to have poured forth to his
   brethren in long ecstatic discourses when the Spirit impelled him to
   speak: for he never taught or spoke unless he felt himself inspired
   thereto by God. When old age came upon him, though his ghostly vision
   never lost its keenness his earthly eyes grew dim: and his later works
   were dictated, when the Spirit moved him, to one of the younger
   brothers of the house. At eighty-eight years of age his strength
   failed: and after a short illness, which never clouded the radiance of
   his spirit, he died upon December 2nd, 1381.

  II

   Ruysbroeck wrote all his works in the dialect of his native province of
   Brabant: which stands in much the same relation to modern Flemish as
   Chaucer's English stands to our own speech. Eleven of these works have
   come down to us in various MS. collections; and all of them, with one
   or two others of doubtful authenticity, are included in the great
   standard Latin translation made in the sixteenth century by the
   Carthusian monk Laurentius Surius. [8]

   The authentic writings are these:

   1. The Spiritual Tabernacle: a long symbolic treatise on the tabernacle
   of the Israelites, considered as a type of the spiritual life.

   2. The Twelve Points of True Faith: a short mystical interpretation of
   the Creed.

   3. The Book of the Four Temptations: an oblique attack on false
   mystics.

   These are probably early works.

   4. The Kingdom of God's Lovers.

   5. The Adornment of the Spiritual Marriage.

   Two elaborate and orderly treatises on the threefold life and
   development of the soul, which probably belong to the first years at
   Groenendael.

   6. The Mirror of Eternal Salvation: written before 1359.

   7. The Seven Cloisters: written before 1363.

   8. The Seven Degrees of Love: written before 1372.

   This group of works, forming a graduated instruction on the ascetic and
   mystical life, seems to have been written for Dame Margaret Van
   Meerbeke, a nun in the Convent of Poor Clares at Brussels.

   9. The Book of the Sparkling Stone.

   10. The Book of Supreme Truth.

   11. The Twelve Béguines.

   These three books, the substance of which is now accessible to English
   readers, [9] contain the finest fruit of Ruysbroeck's genius. The
   Twelve Béguines is partly written in the rough rhymed verse which he
   uses in many parts of The Kingdom of God's Lovers and other places; as
   if at times his ecstatic apprehensions presented themselves to the
   surface mind in a rhythmic form and "prayer into song was turned."
   There is a short example of this in The Book of Truth. Such verse,
   however, though its uncouth strangeness gives to it an impressive
   quality, is a far less successful medium for the expression of his
   subtle mystical perceptions than the vigorous prose style of his best
   passages; for instance, the wonderful ninth chapter of The Sparkling
   Stone. [10]

   When we come to examine the character of these mystical perceptions, we
   find that Ruysbroeck was one of the few mystics who have known how to
   make full use of a strong and disciplined intellect, without ever
   permitting it to encroach on the proper domain of spiritual intuition.
   An orderly and reasoned view of the universe is the ground plan upon
   which the results of those intuitions are set out: yet we are never
   allowed to forget the merely provisional character of the best
   intellectual concepts where we are dealing with ultimate truth.
   Ultimate truth, he says, is not accessible to the human reason: "the
   What-ness of God" we can never know. [11] Yet this need not discourage
   us from exploring, and describing as well as we can, those rich regions
   of approximate truth and life-giving experience which await us beyond
   the ramparts of the sensual world. The intellectual ideas and symbols
   which he uses most often are taken to a large extent from the Bible and
   the Liturgy, and the works of his great predecessors and
   contemporaries; and conform to the main lines of the Christian mystical
   tradition. St Paul and St Augustine, in particular, have influenced his
   thought. The notion popularised by M. Maeterlinck, that Ruysbroeck was
   an "ignorant monk" who became in his ecstacies a profound philosopher,
   is contradicted by the reminiscences of Plato, Aristotle, and Plotinus,
   the many quotations from Dionysius the Areopagite, St Augustine,
   Richard of St Victor, St Bernard, and other mystical authors, which we
   find in his works. Indeed, only those familiar with these great seers
   and thinkers are in a position to recognise the sources and unravel the
   meaning of his more difficult passages. He was in fact almost as well
   equipped on the intellectual as on the contemplative side: and hence
   was enabled to interpret to others, in language with which all educated
   Christians in his day were more or less familiar, something at least of
   the adventures of his spirit in the fathomless Ocean of God.

   Those intellectual concepts, however, of which he availed himself, are
   constantly used by him in an original way: and always as a means of
   expressing the results of direct personal inspiration and experience.
   Particularly characteristic is the living quality with which he invests
   theological formulae that for us have become fixed and sterile. As
   Dante, without deviating from the narrow path of scholastic philosophy,
   brings us at last into the presence of "that Eternal Light which loves
   and smiles," [12] so Ruysbroeck leads us back by way of the most
   orthodox Trinitarian doctrine to the very heart of Reality: the eternal
   and abysmal Fountain of life-giving life.

   In the three books which are now translated we shall find all his most
   characteristic ideas, though here it is only possible to touch upon a
   few of them. [13] For Ruysbroeck, as for St Augustine, Reality is both
   Being and Becoming: one-fold and changeless in essence, active and
   diverse in expression--a dualism aptly represented by the theological
   dogma of the Trinity in Unity. So too man, the image of God, is a unity
   who manifests himself in diversity; "made trinity, like to the unmade
   Blessed Trinity," as our own mystic Julian of Norwich has it. [14] The
   ultimate truth is the Godhead: the Divine Unity of religion, the
   Absolute of philosophy. It is Simple, not with the simplicity of
   negation but with the simplicity of complete affirmation: gathering up
   into its unity all the rich complexities of power, wisdom, and love. In
   its essence it is "dark," "naked," "wayless"; inaccessible to all the
   processes of thought. Yet it is alive through and through; the eternal
   "lifegiving ground" from which all comes. The ideas of "Fatherhood",
   and "Sonhood" represent its quickening fruitfulness; [15] the Holy
   Ghost is the name of the Divine energy and love which pours forth into
   the created world, and thence, like a strong ebb-tide, draws all things
   back into their Origin. [16] Though the soul plunged in God, "sunk in
   His unity," seems to itself to experience a profound rest and
   stillness, yet it is really surrendered to the movement of this mighty
   power: for "God is an ocean that ebbs and flows."

   The ideas, then, of movement, effort, and growth are central for
   Ruysbroeck's thought. Again and again we are impressed by his almost
   modern sense of life and action as the substance of the real: his
   freedom from merely static conceptions. Therefore we find that the
   theme of all his more important books is the growth and development of
   the soul: the forms in which God's energy plays upon it, the forms
   which should be taken by its response. The goal of this development is
   the unified state of "pure simplicity" in which it is able to "lose
   itself in the Fathomless Love" and enter into the complete and beatific
   enjoyment, possession, or use of God--for all these meanings are
   included in the word ghebruken, usually translated "fruition," which is
   his favourite term for the consummation of the mystical life. [17]

   In The Adornment of the Spiritual Marriage this growth is divided into
   the three stages of the Active, Interior, and Superessential Life:
   called in The Sparkling Stone by the old names of the state of Servant,
   Friend, and Son. Man, we know, has a natural, active life; the only one
   that he usually recognises. This he may "adorn with the virtues" and
   make well-pleasing to God (Book I.). But beyond this he has a spiritual
   or "interior" life, which is susceptible of grace, the Divine energy
   and love; and by this can be remodelled in accordance with its true
   pattern or archetype, the Spirit of Christ (Book II.). Beyond this,
   again, he has a superessential or "God-seeing life," in virtue of the
   spark of Divine life implanted in him. By the union of his powers of
   reason will and feeling with this spark--a welding of the several
   elements of his being into unity--he may enter into his highest life;
   the dual and God-like existence of fruition in God and work for God,
   alternate action and rest (Book III.). The correspondences of the
   active life are with that moral order which we recognise as binding on
   all men of good will. Those of the interior life are with the
   experiences which we usually recognise as religious and spiritual. But
   the correspondences of the superessential life are with a plane of
   being which lies beyond thought, and has, so far as our intellectual
   perceptions go, no condition. It is a wayless state, "above reason, not
   without reason"; [18] dark with excess of light. This state is the
   Being of God; but for us it is "beyond being."

   The First Book, then, is almost wholly concerned with the development
   of the Christian character: the only solid and enduring foundation of
   the mystical life. It treats of the virtues which adorn our human
   nature and make it ready for the coming of the Spirit of Christ; and of
   the primary importance of intention, the stretching out of the loving
   will toward God, "having Him in mind" in all things. "Mean only God,"
   said the old English mystics. So for Ruysbroeck meyninghe en
   minnen--will and love--sum up the obligations of the soul at this stage
   of its growth, and prepare it for the greater experiences of the
   interior life. Though he never uses the traditional formula of the
   Mystic Way, we may regard this active life as more or less equivalent
   to the Way of Purgation. The same stage is treated in the 1st and 6th
   chapters of The Sparkling Stone and the 3rd chapter of The Book of
   Truth.

   The Second Book goes on from moral training to spiritual training, and
   includes all that ascetic writers mean by the "Illuminative Way." It
   deals with those "ghostly exercises," the deliberate responses of the
   soul to the invitation of God, which form the first degrees of our
   interior life, and with the dawning of the true mystical consciousness.
   It falls into three chief divisions, treating of three ways in which
   the Spirit of God comes into our inner man (caps. 5, 6, and 7).

   In the first division (caps. 8-32) Ruysbroeck treats of the action of
   grace on the "lower powers," or sense life. In the allegory of the
   Seasons, he describes the normal development of the illuminated life in
   its emotional aspect: its joys and ardours, reactions and despairs. The
   Holy Ghost "hunting the spirit of man" (cap. 3) has seized and
   transfigured those "desirous, affective and irascible" powers of the
   soul which, according to the doctrine of medieval psychology, make up
   natural life of normal men. [19]

   In the second division (caps. 35-38) this process is extended to the
   "higher powers" of the soul: the memory or mind, the understanding, and
   the will. The experience of God is, for these higher powers, an
   experience of fresh enlightenment and fresh ardour; in Ruysbroeck's
   favourite imagery, of light and fire. Grace, which dwells like a living
   fountain at the heart of our personality--the "unity of the
   spirit"--thence pours forth into each faculty in three streams of
   radiance: claerheit, a word expressive at once of pervading brightness
   and limpid clearness, which occurs on almost every page of his
   writings. The sense of this supernal clarity, veritably experienced--a
   viva luce, a quickening light, of which we become aware when we open
   the soul's eyes--is found in nearly every mystical writer from the time
   of St John, and probably originates in that consciousness of enhanced
   lucidity which frequently accompanies spiritual exaltation. It was
   crystallised by the schoolmen in the doctrine of the lumen gloriae--the
   Divine light which transfigures the soul and makes it like to God [20]
   --and much of Ruysbroeck's work is really a poetic elaboration of this
   idea. As a "simple light" this Radiance now frees the mind from the
   teasing complexity of distracting images: as a "spreading light" it
   illuminates the understanding: as a burning flame, it enkindles the
   will. The self thus becomes capable of the first form of contemplation,
   adherence to God by means of the purified reason and will: responding
   to the "loving drawing-nigh" of God--dat minlike neyghen Gods--with an
   ardent outstretching of himself towards that seeking and compelling
   power.

   The powers of the soul, then, in the second stage of illumination,
   become inundated by the divine claerheit. It "drenches them"; and the
   result of this is seen in the state of perfect charity to which the
   self now attains: the condition of equable outflowing love to God and
   all manner of men (caps. 39-43). In the third and highest stage (caps.
   49-65), we pass beyond the enhancement and enlightenment of the
   separate powers of our nature to the "essential being" of the self:
   that unity of the spirit of which Ruysbroeck is always speaking, and
   wherefrom the powers proceed, as the Divine Persons proceed from the
   Unity of God. [21] Whether our mental and emotional powers as such
   participate in the spiritual life, is for him a secondary
   consideration. They may do so, if they be wholly surrendered to God.
   But our true union with Him takes place in the abysmal deeps of our
   being--our "ground"--and ever abides there: for here our life, as it
   were, buds out from the Divine life, and here God dwells eternally
   "according to His essence." If we learn to enter within, passing beyond
   the powers to the unity of the spirit, we become conscious of this.
   [22] There we experience His mysterious touch and stirrings; feel and
   respond to the thrust and invitation of His love, as He drives each
   created spirit forth to work His will, and draws it home again towards
   His heart. There, outside Time, the Eternal Birth takes place (caps.
   57-61).

   As a result of this practice in introversion, this simplification of
   consciousness, the self now first becomes capable of the second form of
   contemplation, described in The Twelve Béguines as

   "A knowing which is in no wise;

   For ever abiding above the reason." [23]

   and enters upon that profound yet simple communion with God which
   Ruysbroeck calls the most inward of all exercises. For this his
   favourite image is that of feeding: the soul tastes God (cap. 65),
   eats, devours, assimilates Him, and in her turn is eaten and consumed
   [24] --language which probably reflects his great personal devotion to
   the Eucharist. With this mystical savouring and feeding upon Reality,
   the self reaches the term of the interior life, and the full stature of
   that "secret friend of God" described with such marvellous subtlety in
   the 8th chapter of The Sparkling Stone.

   It is at this point that the dangers of a false mysticism make
   themselves felt. Here, then, Ruysbroeck enters upon a vigorous and
   acute criticism of Quietism (caps. 66-67): especially valuable to us at
   the present day, when so many irresponsible apostles of "new mysticism"
   are recommending voluntary passivity of this type as a substitute for
   the stern discipline and perpetual willed effort involved in the
   Christian science of prayer. Ruysbroeck describes the interior
   blankness and silence of the quietist as a psychic trick: a deliberate
   sinking down into the subconscious--the subsoil of human nature--where
   it is true that the Divine Life dwells and supports our created life,
   but where we are below instead of above the levels of normal
   consciousness. Here, indeed, the soul experiences a sensation of rest
   and peace: but it is merely resting in its own emptiness, a false
   repose which demands no exercise of virtue, no tension of the will, and
   is a caricature of the active and loving surrender taught by the
   Christian saints. The true emptiness and idleness of which Ruysbroeck
   speaks as an essential preparation of the contemplative state, is a
   condition of meek and passive attentiveness to God, which excludes
   consciousness of the ordinary objects of perception and thought; sweeps
   and garnishes the interior castle. Here the virtue is not in the
   emptiness and idleness, but in the humble and eager yielding of
   ourselves. Although man cannot by his own effort reach God, yet without
   such deliberate loving effort we shall never possess Him. [25]

   Beyond even the highest point of this interior life, in which the
   contemplative feels himself to be living "in God," [26] is that
   transfigured or deified life, as the Platonic mystics named it, which
   Ruysbroeck calls overwesen--superessential--the life of the "God-seeing
   man" (Book III). Whereas in the interior life we may be said to
   re-discover the lost inheritance of our spirit, in this life there is a
   genuine transcendence, a passing beyond that spirit's created being:
   for the Being of God, in which this consummation is found, is "more
   than being" to us. It abides beyond all the concepts of reason, beyond
   anything that we can name or describe, outside Time, in the bosom of
   Divine Reality: that deep Quiet of the Godhead which cannot be moved.
   Those who ascend thereto have passed from the state of "secret friends"
   to that of the "hidden sons" of God, and completed the soul's journey
   to its home. [27] Then they find themselves, so far as their separate
   consciousness persists, in a place that is placeless and a way that is
   wayless: in the abysmal Onwise of God, a word for which we have no
   exact equivalent, but which embodies one of Ruysbroeck's most important
   conceptions, and is the occasion of some of his most mysterious
   utterances. It represents that world of spiritual reality which is
   beyond all attributes and conditions; which is neither This nor That,
   which is "in no wise"--the Absolute wherein all ways and modes of
   being, all wise, are swallowed up, and all our finite perceptions die
   into ignorance and darkness (cap. 4). [28]

   "The splendour of That which is in no wise is as a fair mirror

   Wherein shines the everlasting light of God:

   It has no attributes,

   And in it all the activities of reason fail.

   It is not God

   But it is the light whereby we see Him:

   Those who walk in the divine light thereof

   Discover in themselves the Unwalled." [29]

   Seen from the synthetic and spiritual point of view, this supernal
   world of experience is the Essential Unity, wherein the richness of
   Eternal Life consists, and where the surrendered soul enjoys the
   peaceful fruition of God. But seen from the analytic and intellectual
   point of view it is the Essential Nudity, the "nought" or "divine dark"
   of Dionysius the Areopagite: for it has been stripped of every
   character of which we can think. [30] Here the mystic feels himself, as
   regards his essential being, to be poured out into God, melted and
   merged in Him as a river in the sea: and, as regards his own separate
   consciousness, apprehends Him in one simple act of absorbed attention
   "seeing and staring" with wide-open eyes. It is in this one act,
   sometimes felt by us as a passing beyond ourselves, sometimes as a
   fixed ecstatic vision, "beholding that which we are, and becoming that
   which we behold" that the self at last knows itself to be one life and
   one spirit with God. [31]

   The mystic has now entered into union with the three wise, the three
   modes or ways, under which Divine Love imparts itself in the spirit of
   man: characteristically distinguished by Ruysbroeck as three forms of
   movement. First this energetic love pours itself out from the Godhead
   into us as grace: and we, in receiving it and making it ours by our
   virtues and good works, are united to God "through means." This is the
   function of the active life harmonising man's work with God's work.
   Then, as a compelling tide, it draws us within its own flood back
   towards God. This is the union "without means"' wherein we are wholly
   surrendered to His love: it is the proper condition of the interior
   life. But when we have reached the superessential life, and seem to our
   own feeling to be lost in the Darkness, burned up in the Brightness,
   and sunk in the Eternal Stillness of God--that "dark silence where all
   lovers lose themselves," [32] --then the circle is complete. We are
   made part of His divine fruition or "content the eternal satisfaction
   and eternal activity of Perfect Love; achieving thus the "union without
   distinction," though not union without "otherness." [33] Henceforward
   we can participate in God's dual life of rest and work, transcendent
   fruition and immanent fruitfulness: abiding in restful possession of
   Him, yet perpetually sent down from the heights to serve the whole
   world. [34]

   The final state of the Christian mystic, then, is not annihilation in
   the Absolute. It is a condition wherein we dwell wholly in God, one
   life and truth with Him; yet still "feel God and ourselves," as the
   lover feels his beloved, in a perfect union which depends for its joy
   on an invincible otherness. The soul, transfused and transfigured by
   the Divine Love as molten iron is by the fire, becomes, it is true,
   "one simple blessedness with God" [35] yet ever retains its
   individuality: one with God beyond itself, yet other than God within
   itself. [36] The "deified man" is fully human still, but spiritualised
   through and through; not by the destruction of his personality, but by
   the taking up of his manhood into God. There he finds, not a static
   beatitude, but a Height, a Depth, a Breadth of which he is made part,
   yet to which he can never attain: for the creature, even at its
   highest, remains finite, and is conscious that Infinity perpetually
   eludes its grasp and leads it on. So heaven itself is discovered to be
   no mere passive fulfillment, but rather a forward-moving life: [37] an
   ever new loving and tasting, new exploring and enjoying of the Infinite
   Fulness of God, that inexhaustible Object of our knowledge and delight.
   It is the eternal voyage of the adventurous soul on the vast and stormy
   sea of the Divine.

HERE BEGINS

                                 THE FIRST BOOK

  PROLOGUE

   Ecce sponsus venit,

   exile obviam ei.

   Behold, the Bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet him. These words were
   written by St Matthew the Evangelist, and Christ spoke them to His
   disciples and to all other men in the parable of the virgins. This
   Bridegroom is Christ, and human nature is the bride; the which God has
   made in His own image and after His likeness. And in the beginning He
   had set her in the highest and most beautiful, the richest and most
   fertile place in all the earth: that is, in Paradise. And He had given
   her dominion over all creatures; and He had adorned her with graces;
   and had given her a commandment, so that by obedience she might have
   merited to be confirmed and established with her Bridegroom in an
   eternal troth, and never to fall into any grief, or any sin.

   Then came a beguiler, the hellish fiend, full of envy, in the shape of
   a subtle serpent, and he beguiled the woman; and they both beguiled the
   man, in whom above all the whole of our nature consists. And the fiend
   seduced that nature, the bride of God, with false counsel; and she was
   driven into a strange country, poor and miserable and captive and
   oppressed, and beset by her enemies; so that it seemed as though she
   might never attain reconciliation and return again to her native land.

   But when God thought the time had come, and had mercy on the suffering
   of His beloved, He sent His Only Begotten Son to earth, in a fair
   chamber, in a glorious temple; that is, in the body of the Virgin Mary.
   There He was married to this bride, our nature, and He united her with
   His own person through the most pure blood of this noble Virgin. The
   priest who married the bride was the Holy Ghost; the angel Gabriel
   brought the offer; the glorious Virgin gave her consent. Thus Christ,
   our faithful Bridegroom, united our nature with His person; and He has
   sought us in strange countries, and taught us heavenly customs and
   perfect faithfulness, and has laboured for us and fought as our
   champion against the adversary. And He has broken open our prison, and
   won the victory, and by His death slain our death; and He has redeemed
   us by His blood, and made us free through His living waters of baptism,
   and enriched us with His sacraments and with His gifts: that we might
   go out (as He says) with all the virtues, to meet Him in the house of
   glory and to enjoy Him without end in eternity.

   Now Christ, the Master of Truth, says: Behold the Bridegroom cometh, go
   ye out to meet Him. In these words, Christ our Lover teaches us four
   things. First, He gives us a command, in that He says: Behold. Those
   who neglect this command and remain blind are all damned. Secondly, He
   shows us what we shall see, that is, the coming of the Bridegroom; for
   He says, The Bridegroom cometh. In the third place, He teaches and
   commands us what we shall do, for He says: Go ye out. And in the fourth
   place, by saying: To meet Him, He shows us the use and the purpose of
   our labour and of all our life; that is to say, the loving meeting with
   our Bridegroom.

   These words we shall now declare and set forth in three ways. First,
   according to the common way relating to the life of beginners, which is
   called the Active Life, and which is necessary for all men who wish to
   be saved. Secondly, we will explain these same words in their relation
   to the interior, exalted, and God-desiring life, at which many men may
   arrive by their virtues and by the grace of God. Thirdly, we will
   expound them in respect of a superessential, God-seeing life, which few
   men can attain or taste, by reason of the sublimity and high nobility
   of that life.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER I

  OF THE ACTIVE LIFE

   Since the time of Adam, Christ, the Wisdom of the Father, has said to
   all men, and He says so still, inwardly according to His Divinity:
   Behold. And this beholding is needful. Now mark this well: that for
   anyone who wishes to see, either in a bodily or a ghostly manner, three
   things are necessary.

   The first thing is that, if a man will see bodily and outwardly, he
   must have the outward light of heaven, or some other material light, to
   illuminate the medium, that is, the air, through which he will see. The
   second thing is, that he must permit the things which he wishes to see
   to be reflected in his eyes. And the third thing is that the organs,
   the eyes, must be sound and flawless, so that gross bodily things can
   be subtly reflected in them. If a man lack any of these three things
   his bodily sight is wanting. Of this sight, however, we shall say
   nothing more; but we shall speak of a ghostly and supernatural sight,
   in which all our bliss abides.

   For all who wish to see in a ghostly and supernatural manner three
   things also are needful. The first is the light of Divine grace; the
   second is a free turning of the will to God, the third is a conscience
   clean from any mortal sin.

   Now mark this: God being a common good, and His boundless love being
   common to all, He gives His grace in two ways: prevenient grace, and
   the grace by which one merits eternal life. Prevenient grace is common
   to all men, Pagan and Jew, good and evil. By reason of His common love,
   which God has towards all men, He has caused His name and the
   redemption of human nature to be preached and revealed to the uttermost
   parts of the earth. Whosoever wishes to turn to Him can turn to Him.
   All the sacraments, baptism and every other sacrament are made ready
   for all men who wish to receive them according to the needs of each;
   for God wishes to save all men and to lose not one. At the day of
   Judgment, no one shall be able to complain that, had he wished to be
   converted, but little was done for him. Thus God is a common light and
   a common splendour enlightening heaven and earth, and every man, each
   according to his need and worth. [38]

   But although, even as God is common to all, the sun shines upon all
   trees, yet many a tree remains without fruits, and many a tree brings
   forth wild fruits of little use to men. And for this reason such trees
   are pruned, and shoots of fruitful trees are grafted into them, so that
   they may bear good fruits, savoury and useful to man.

   The light of Divine grace is a fruit-bearing shoot, coming forth from
   the living paradise of the eternal kingdom; and no deed can bring
   refreshment or profit to man if it be not born of this shoot. This
   shoot of Divine grace, which makes man pleasing to God, and through
   which he merits eternal life, is offered to all men. But it is not
   grafted into all, because some will not cut away the wild branches of
   their trees; that is, unbelief, and a perverse and disobedient will
   opposed to the commandments of God.

   But if this shoot of God's grace is to be grafted into our souls, there
   must be of necessity three things: the prevenient grace of God, the
   conversion of one's own free will, and the purification of conscience.
   The prevenient grace touches all men, God bestowing it upon all men.
   But not all men give on their part the conversion of the will and the
   purification of conscience; and that is why so many lack the grace of
   God, through which they should merit eternal life.

   The prevenient grace of God touches a man from without and from within.
   From without through sickness; or through the loss of external goods,
   of kinsmen, and of friends; or through public disgrace. Or he may be
   stirred by a sermon, or by the examples of the saints or of good men,
   their words, or their deeds; so that he learns to recognize himself as
   he is. This is how God touches a man from without.

   Sometimes a man is touched also from within, through remembering the
   sorrows and the sufferings of our Lord, and the good which God has
   bestowed upon him and upon all other men; or by considering his sins,
   the shortness of life, the fear of death and the fear of hell, the
   eternal torments of hell and the eternal joy of heaven, and how God has
   spared him in his sins and has awaited his conversion. Or he may ponder
   the marvellous works of God in heaven and in earth, and in all
   creatures. Such are the workings of the prevenient grace of God,
   stirring men from without and from within, in many ways. And besides
   this, man has a natural tendency towards God, because of the spark of
   the soul, and because of that highest reason, which always desires the
   good and hates the evil. In all these ways God touches all men, each
   one according to his need; so that at times a man is smitten, reproved,
   alarmed, and stands still within himself to consider himself. And all
   this is still prevenient grace, and not yet efficacious grace. Thus
   does prevenient grace prepare the soul for the reception of the other
   grace, through which eternal life is merited. For when the soul has
   thus got rid of evil willing and evil doing, it is perplexed and
   smitten with fear of what it should do, considering itself, its wicked
   works, and God. And from this there arise a natural repentance of its
   sins and a natural good-will. Such is the highest work of prevenient
   grace.

   If a man does all he can, and cannot do more because of his feebleness,
   it rests with the infinite goodness of God to finish the work. Then,
   straight as a sunbeam, there comes a higher light of Divine grace, and
   it is shed into the soul according to its worth, though neither merited
   nor desired. For in this light God gives Himself out of free goodness
   and generosity, the which never creature can merit before it has
   received it. And this is an inward and mysterious working of God in the
   soul, above time; and it moves the soul and all its powers. Therewith
   ends prevenient grace and begins the other grace, that is to say, the
   supernatural light.

   This light is the first point necessary, and from it there arises a
   second point, and that on the part of the soul; namely, the free
   conversion of the will, in a single moment of time. And here it is that
   charity is born of the union of God with the soul. These two points
   hang together, so that the one cannot be fulfilled without the other.
   Where God and the soul come together in the union of love, then God,
   above time, gives His light; and the soul, in a single moment of time,
   gives, by virtue of the grace received, its free conversion to Him. And
   there charity is born of God and of the soul in the soul, for charity
   is a bond of love, tying God to the loving soul.

   Of these two things--that is to say, the grace of God and the free
   conversion of the will enlightened by grace--charity, that is, Divine
   love, is born. And from this Divine love the third point arises; that
   is, the purification of conscience. And these three points belong
   together in such a way that one cannot exist long without the others;
   for whosoever has Divine love has also perfect contrition for his sins.

   Yet here we must take heed to the order of Divine and creaturely things
   as they are here shown. For God gives His light, and by this light man
   gives his willing and perfect conversion: and of these two is born a
   perfect love towards God. And from this love there come forth perfect
   contrition and purification of conscience. And these arise from the
   consideration of misdeeds and all that may defile the soul: for when a
   man loves God he despises himself and all his works. This is the order
   of every conversion. From it there come true repentance, a perfect
   sorrow for every evil thing which one has done, and an ardent desire
   never to sin again and evermore to serve God in humble obedience. Hence
   too an open confession, without reserve, ambiguity, or excuse; a
   perfect satisfaction according to the counsel of a prudent priest; and
   the beginning of virtue and of all good works.

   These three things, as you have heard, are needful to a spiritual or
   godly sight. If you have them, Christ is saying within you: Behold, and
   you are beholding in truth. And this is the first of the four chief
   points; namely, that in which Christ our Lord says: Behold.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [38] "Light" is the second of the Divine Names which Dionysius the
   Areopagite attributes to the Godhead, being placed by him between
   "Goodness" and "Beauty"; and his influence may be traced in
   Ruysbroeck's frequent use of it. Thus he says, "Let us now extol the
   spiritual name of Light, under which we contemplate the Good; and
   declare that He is called spiritual Light because He fills every
   supercelestial mind with spiritual light, expelling ignorance and error
   from all souls in which they may be . . . the Good is therefore called
   spiritual Light above all other light: as fontal Ray and overflowing
   Stream of light, shining out of its fulness upon every mind above,
   around, and in the world, renewing all their powers, and embracing them
   in its span. (Divine Names, cap. 4.)
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER II

  SHOWING HOW WE SHALL CONSIDER THE COMING OF CHRIST IN THREE WAYS

   Now, by saying: The Bridegroom cometh, He shows us further what we
   shall see. Christ, our Bridegroom, spoke this word in Latin: Venit. And
   this word implies two tenses, the past and the present; and yet here it
   denotes the future too.

   And that is why we shall consider three comings of our Bridegroom,
   Jesus Christ. In the first coming He became man, for man's sake, out of
   love. The second coming takes place daily, often and many times, in
   every loving heart, with new graces and with new gifts, as each is able
   to receive them. The third coming we shall see as the coming in the
   Judgment, or at the hour of death. And in all these comings there are
   three things to be considered: the why and the wherefore, the inward
   way, and the outward work.

   The reason why God created the angels and man, was His unfathomable
   goodness and nobleness whereby He willed to do it; that the bliss and
   the richness which He is Himself might be revealed to rational
   creatures, so that they might taste Him in time, and enjoy Him outside
   time in eternity.

   The reason why God became man was His incomprehensible love, and the
   need of all men; for man had been corrupted by the Fall, and could not
   amend himself.

   But the reason why Christ, according to His Godhead and according to
   His manhood, wrought all His works on earth, this reason is fourfold:
   His Divine love which is without measure; the created love, called
   charity, which He had in His soul through union with the Eternal Word
   and through the perfect gift of His Father; the great need of man; and
   the glory of His Father. These are the reasons for the coming of Christ
   our Bridegroom, and for all His works, both outward and inward.

   Now, if we would follow Christ our Bridegroom in virtue, so far as we
   are able, we must consider in what wise He was inwardly and the works
   which He wrought outwardly; that is to say, His virtues and the deeds
   of these virtues.

   In what wise He was according to His Godhead, this is inaccessible and
   incomprehensible to us; for it is that according to which He is born of
   the Father without ceasing, and wherein the Father, in Him and through
   Him, knows, creates, orders and rules all things in heaven and on
   earth. For He is the Wisdom of the Father, and they breathe forth one
   Spirit, that is, one Love, which is a common bond between Them and all
   saints, and all good men in heaven and on earth. Of this condition we
   shall not speak any more; but we shall speak of that condition which He
   had through Divine gifts and according to His created manhood. [39] And
   this condition was manifold. For as many inward virtues as Christ
   possessed, so many were His inward conditions: for every virtue has its
   special condition. The sum of the virtues and conditions in the soul of
   Christ, this is above the understanding and above the comprehension of
   all creatures. But we shall take three of them: namely, humility,
   charity, and patient suffering, in inward and outward things. These are
   the three chief roots and beginnings of all virtues and all perfection.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [39] The word here translated "conditions" is Ruysbroeck's favourite
   term, "wise," meaning ways or modes of being; literally, "how" Christ
   was as regards each virtue. The Flemish of this passage reads, "Want
   alsoe menighe inwendighe doghet, alsoe menighe inwendighe wise hadde
   Christus."
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER III

  OF HUMILITY

   Now understand this: we find in Christ, according to His Godhead, two
   kinds of humility.

   The first kind is this: that He willed to become man, and took upon
   Himself that very nature which had been banished and cursed to the
   bottom of hell, and willed to become one with it according to His
   personality; so that now any man, either good or evil, can say: Christ,
   the Son of God, is my brother.

   The second kind of humility according to His Godhead consists in this;
   that He chose a poor maiden, and not a king's daughter, for His mother,
   so that a poor maiden should be the mother of God, who is Lord of
   heaven and earth and all creatures.

   And further, we can say of all the works of humility which Christ ever
   wrought, that they were wrought by God Himself.

   Now let us take the humility which was in Christ according to His
   manhood and through the grace and the gifts of God. In this humility
   His soul with all its powers bowed down in reverence and adoration
   before the most high might of the Father; for a bowed down heart is a
   humble heart. And therefore He wrought all His works for the praise and
   for the honour of His Father, and never and in nothing sought His own
   glory according to His humanity.

   He was humble and subject to the old law, and to the commandments, and
   also to custom whenever such was right. And that is why He was
   circumcised, and taken into the temple, and redeemed in the customary
   way; and He paid His tribute money to Caesar like any other Jew. And He
   was humble and subject to His mother and to the lord Joseph; and that
   is why He served them with true reverence according to all their needs.
   He chose poor and outcast people for His comrades, to live with, and
   wherewith to convert the world: these were the Apostles. And He was
   lowly and meek among them and among all other men. And He was ever
   ready for all men in whatever inward or outward need they might be: as
   if he were the servant of all the world.

   This is the first point which we find in Christ our Bridegroom.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER IV

  OF CHARITY

   The second point is charity, beginning and origin of all virtues. This
   charity upheld the higher powers of His soul in quietness, and in a
   fruition of that very bliss which He now enjoys. And this charity kept
   Him constantly uplifted to His Father in reverence, in love, in
   adoration, in praise; with fervent prayers for the needs of all men,
   and with an offering up of all His works to the glory of His Father.

   It was also this same charity that made Christ stoop with loving
   faithfulness and kindness to the bodily and ghostly needs of all men.
   And in this He gave an example to all men, teaching them by His life
   how to live. He fed in ghostly wise with true and inward teachings all
   those men who could understand them: and others from without through
   the senses with signs and wonders. And sometimes He fed them also with
   bodily food, as when they had followed Him into the desert and were in
   need of it. He made the deaf hear and the lame walk straight, and the
   blind see, and the dumb speak, and cast forth devils from men. He
   raised up the dead; and this should be understood both in a bodily and
   a ghostly way. Christ, our Lover, has laboured for us from without and
   from within, with true faithfulness. His charity we cannot fathom and
   understand, for it flows out of the unfathomable fountain of the Holy
   Ghost, and transcends all that creatures have ever experienced of
   charity; for Christ was God and man in one Person.

   And this is the second point: that is to say, charity.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER V

  OF PATIENT ENDURANCE

   The third point is patient endurance. We should mark this point
   carefully, for it adorned Christ our Bridegroom during all His life.
   For His sufferings began very early, as soon as He was born; they began
   with poverty and cold. Then He was circumcised and shed His blood; He
   was driven to a strange country; He served the lord Joseph and His
   mother; He suffered hunger and thirst, shame and contempt, the vile
   words and works of the Jews. He fasted, He watched, and He was tempted
   by the devil. He was subject to all men; He wandered from country to
   country, from town to town, with much labour and great zeal, that He
   might preach the Gospel.

   At last He was taken prisoner by the Jews, who were His enemies, though
   He was their friend. He was betrayed, mocked and insulted, scourged and
   buffetted, and condemned by false witness. He bore His cross with great
   pains up to the highest point of the land. He was stripped stark naked.
   So fair a body neither man nor woman ever saw so cruelly ill-used. He
   suffered shame, and anguish, and cold, before all the world: for He was
   naked, and it was cold, and a searching wind cut into His wounds. He
   was nailed to the wood of the cross with blunt nails, and so stretched
   out that His veins were torn asunder. He was lifted up and then flung
   down, and because of the blow His wounds began to bleed again. His head
   was crowned with thorns; His ears heard the Jews cry in their fury:
   Crucify Him, Crucify Him, with many other infamous words. His eyes saw
   the hardness and malice of the Jews, and the anguish of His mother. And
   His eyes overflowed with the bitterness of sorrow and death; His nose
   smelt the filth which the Jews spat out of their mouths into His face;
   His mouth and tongue dripped with vinegar mingled with gall, and every
   sensitive part of His body had been wounded by the scourge.

   Christ our Bridegroom, wounded to the death, forsaken of God and of all
   creatures, dying on the cross, hanging like a log for which no one
   cared, save Mary, His poor mother, who could not help Him!

   Christ also suffered spiritually, in His soul, because of the hardened
   hearts of the Jews and of those who were putting Him to death; for
   whatever signs and wonders they saw, they remained in their wickedness.
   And He suffered because of their corruption and because of the
   vengeance for His death; for He knew that God would avenge it on them,
   body and soul. Also He suffered from the distress and anguish of His
   mother and His disciples, who were in great affliction. And He suffered
   still more, because His death would be of no profit to so many men, and
   because of the ingratitude of man and because of the false oaths which
   many would swear, reviling and blaspheming Him Who had died out of love
   for us all. And also His bodily nature and His lower reason suffered,
   because God had withdrawn the inflow of His grace and of His
   consolations, and had left them alone in such distress. And of this
   Christ complained, exclaiming: My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken
   Me? But as to all His sufferings our Lover was silent; and cried to His
   Father saying: Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.
   And Christ was heard of His Father because of His reverence; for those
   who acted from ignorance were soon afterwards converted.

   These then were Christ's inward virtues: humility, charity, and patient
   endurance. These three virtues Christ our Bridegroom practised during
   all His life, and He died with them, and paid our debt according to
   justice. And of His generosity He has opened His side. Thence flow
   forth the rivers of well-being and the sacraments of bliss. And He has
   ascended in power, and sits at the right hand of the Father, and reigns
   in eternity.

   This is the first coming of our Bridegroom, and it is wholly past.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VI

  OF THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST

   The second coming of Christ our Bridegroom takes place every day within
   good men; often and many times, with new graces and gifts, in all those
   who make themselves ready for it, each according to his power. We would
   not speak here of a man's first conversion, nor of the first grace
   which was given to him when he turned from sin to the virtues. But we
   would speak of an increase of new gifts and new virtues from day to
   day, and of the present coming of Christ our Bridegroom which takes
   place daily within our souls.

   Now we must consider the why and the wherefore, the way and the working
   of this coming. Its wherefore is fourfold: God's mercy and our
   destitution, God's generosity and our desire. These four things cause
   the growth of virtue and of nobleness.

   Now understand this: when the sun sends its beams and its radiance into
   a deep valley between two high mountains, and, standing in the zenith,
   can yet shine upon the bottom and ground of the valley, then three
   things happen: the valley becomes full of light by reflection from the
   mountains, and it receives more heat, and becomes more fruitful, than
   the plain and level country. And so likewise, when a good man takes his
   stand upon his own littleness, in the most lowly part of himself, and
   confesses and knows that he has nothing, and is nothing, and can
   nothing, of himself, neither stand still nor go on, and when he sees
   how often he fails in virtues and good works: then he confesses his
   poverty and his helplessness, then he makes a valley of humility. And
   when he is thus humble, and needy, and knows his own need; he lays his
   distress, and complains of it, before the bounty and the mercy of God.
   And so he marks the sublimity of God and his own lowliness; and thus he
   becomes a deep valley. And Christ is a Sun of righteousness and also of
   mercy, Who stands in the highest part of the firmament, that is, on the
   right hand of the Father, and from thence He shines into the bottom of
   the humble heart; for Christ is always moved by helplessness, whenever
   a man complains of it and lays it before Him with humility. Then there
   arise two mountains, that is, two desires; one to serve God and praise
   Him with reverence, the other to attain noble virtues. Those two
   mountains are higher than the heavens, for these longings touch God
   without intermediary, and crave His ungrudging generosity. And then
   that generosity cannot withhold itself, it must flow forth; for then
   the soul is made ready to receive, and to hold, more gifts.

   These are the wherefore, and the way of the new coming with new
   virtues. Then, this valley, the humble heart, receives three things: it
   becomes more radiant and enlightened by grace, it becomes more ardent
   in charity, and it becomes more fruitful in perfect virtues and in good
   works. And thus you have the why, the way, and the work of this coming.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VII

  OF THE BLESSED SACRAMENTS

   There is still another coming of Christ our Bridegroom, taking place
   every day, with growth of grace and renewal of gifts. That is, when a
   man receives some sacrament with a humble heart void of anything
   contrary thereto. In this way he receives new gifts and more ample
   grace, because of his humility and through the mysterious working of
   Christ in the sacraments. Those things which are contrary to the
   sacraments are unbelief in Baptism, a lack of repentance in Confession,
   and approaching the Sacrament of the Altar in the state of mortal sin
   or with an evil intention; and so on as regards the other sacraments.
   Those who act thus receive no new grace; rather does their sinfulness
   increase.

   This is the other coming of Christ our Bridegroom, which is present
   with us every day. We should consider it with a desiring heart, lest it
   should not take place within us; for it is needful, if we are to remain
   steadfast and to go forward in eternal life.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VIII

  OF THE THIRD COMING OF CHRIST

   The third coming, which is yet to be, will take place at the Judgment,
   or in the hour of death. The wherefore of this coming is the fitting
   time, the due cause, and the righteousness of the Judge.

   The time which is fitting for this coming is the hour of death, and the
   Last Judgment of all men. When God created the soul out of nothing and
   united it with the body, He set a fixed day and a fixed hour known only
   of Him, when it should have to give up temporal things and to appear in
   His presence.

   The due cause: for the soul must then account for every word spoken and
   for every deed done, before the Eternal Truth.

   The righteousness of the Judge, for it is to Christ that this Judgment
   and this Verdict belong; for He is the Son of Man and the Wisdom of the
   Father, and to this Wisdom all judgment is given, since all hearts, in
   heaven, and on earth, and in hell, are clear and open to It. And
   therefore these three points are the occasions of the general coming in
   the Day of Doom, and of the particular coming to each man in the hour
   of his death.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER IX

   SHOWING WHAT CHRIST WILL DO IN THE DAY OF DOOM

   In this Judgment Christ, our Bridegroom and our Judge, will reward and
   punish, according to justice; for He will give every man that which he
   has earned. He will give to the good, for every good work done in God,
   a wage without measure, that is to say, God's very Self, Whom no
   creature of itself can earn. But when God works these works with and
   through the creature, then by His power the creature gains His very
   Self as wage. And with due justice He will give eternal woe and eternal
   sorrow to the damned; for these despised and rejected the Eternal Good
   for a good that cannot endure. And of their own free will they have
   turned away from God, and have set themselves against His glory and His
   will, and have sought after creatures; and so shall they be justly
   condemned.

   Those who bear witness at the Judgment are the angels and the
   conscience of men. And the adversary is the hellish fiend; and the
   Judge is Christ, Whom none can deceive.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER X

  OF THE FIVE KINDS OF MEN WHO SHALL APPEAR AT THE JUDGMENT

   Five kinds of men shall appear before this Judge.

   The first, and the worst, are those Christians who have died in mortal
   sin, without repentance and without regret; for these have despised the
   death of Christ and His sacraments, or else they have received them
   unworthily and in vain. And they have not practised the works of mercy,
   showing charity toward their neighbours, as God has commanded. And for
   this they are doomed to the depths of hell.

   The second kind are the unbelievers, Pagans and Jews. These must all
   appear before Christ, though they were damned already during their
   lives; for, in their time, they possessed neither Divine grace nor
   Divine love, and for this reason they have always dwelt in the eternal
   death of damnation. But these shall have less pain than the evil
   Christians; for, since they received fewer gifts of God, they owed Him
   less loyalty.

   The third kind are those good Christians who, from time to time, fell
   into sin, and rose again through contrition and penance; but who have
   not made full satisfaction for their sins according to justice. These
   belong to purgatory.

   The fourth kind consists of those men who have kept God's commandments;
   or, when they broke them, they have returned to God with contrition and
   with penance, and with works of charity and mercy and so have made
   satisfaction; so that their souls coming forth from their mouths go
   straight to heaven, without passing through purgatory.

   The fifth kind are all those who, above all outward works of charity,
   have their sojourn in heaven, and are noughted and lost in God, and God
   in them, so that there is no other thing between God and them but time
   and their mortal nature. When these men are made free from their
   bodies, they enjoy, in that very moment, eternal bliss; and they are
   not judged, but shall themselves judge other men, with Christ, in the
   Day of Doom. And then all mortal life, and all temporal sorrows, both
   on earth and in purgatory, shall end, and all the souls of the damned,
   together with the Fiend and his companions, shall sink and disappear in
   the deeps of hell, in a corruption and everlasting horror without end.
   And in the twinkling of an eye the blessed shall be with Christ their
   Bridegroom in eternal glory; and they shall see and taste and enjoy the
   fathomless riches of the Being of God, eternally and for ever.

   This is the third coming, which all of us await, and which is still to
   happen. The first coming, when God became man and lived in humility
   among us, and died for the love of us, this coming we should imitate,
   outwardly by fulfilling the perfect moral virtues, inwardly by the
   practice of charity and true humility. In the second coming, which
   happens in the present time, He comes with grace within each loving
   heart; and this coming we should long for and pray for every day, that
   we may remain steadfast and grow in new virtues. The third coming, at
   the Judgment, or in the hour of death, we should expect with longing,
   with trust, and with awe; that we may be set free from this misery and
   enter into the house of glory.

   This coming in its three ways is the second point of the four chief
   points, wherein Christ says: Sponsus venit, The Bridegroom cometh.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XI

  OF A SPIRITUAL GOING OUT WITH ALL VIRTUES

   Now understand and mark this: Christ says, at the beginning of this
   precept, Behold; and this is done through charity and a pure
   conscience, as you have heard before. Then He has shown us what we
   shall see, that is, the threefold coming.

   Now He commands us what we shall do next, and says: Go ye out. If you
   possess the first point, that is, if you are able to see, through grace
   and through charity; and if, further, you have gazed well upon your
   pattern Christ and His going out; then, there arises within you, out of
   charity, and out of the loving observation of your Bridegroom, a
   righteousness, [40] namely, that thereafter you long to follow Him in
   the virtues. Then Christ is saying within you: Go ye out. This going
   out must be done in three ways: we must go out towards God, towards
   ourselves, and towards our neighbours, and this we must do by means of
   charity and righteousness. For charity ever strives towards the height,
   towards the kingdom of God, which is God Himself; for He is the source
   from which unmediated charity flows forth, and wherein it abides in the
   Unity. And righteousness, which is born of charity, wills the
   perfection of all the moral and all the other virtues which are
   honourable and proper to the kingdom of God, that is the soul.

   Charity and Righteousness: these two lay the foundation of the kingdom
   of the soul where God would dwell. And this foundation is humility.

   These three virtues prop and bear the whole weight and the whole
   edifice of all the other virtues and of all transcendence. For charity
   always confronts man with the unfathomable goodness of God, from which
   it has flowed forth, that thereby he may live worthily and remain
   steadfast before God, and grow in true humility and all other virtues.
   And righteousness places man face to face with the eternal truth of
   God, that he may know truth, and become enlightened, and may fulfil all
   virtue without erring. But humility brings man face to face with the
   most high mightiness of God, that he may always remain little and
   lowly, and may surrender himself to God, and may not stand upon his
   selfhood. This is the way in which a man should hold himself before
   God, that thereby he may grow continually in new virtues.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [40] "Righteousness" (gherechticheit) must be read here and onwards in
   the sense, not only of goodness, but of justice and rightness in the
   conduct of life. "It is meet and right so to do."
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XII

  HOW HUMILITY IS THE FOUNDATION OF ALL OTHER VIRTUES

   Now consider this: as we have laid down humility as a foundation, so
   therefore we shall speak of humility first.

   Humility, that is lowliness or self-abasement, is an inward bowing down
   or prostrating of the heart and of the conscience before God's
   transcendent worth. Righteousness demands and orders this, and through
   charity a loving heart cannot leave it undone. When a lowly and loving
   man considers that God has served him so humbly, so lovingly, and so
   faithfully; and sees God so high, and so mighty, and so noble, and man
   so poor, and so little, and so low: then there springs up within the
   humble heart a great awe and a great veneration for God. For to pay
   homage to God by every outward and inward act, this is the first and
   dearest work of humility, the most savoury among those of charity, and
   most meet among those of righteousness. The loving and humble heart
   cannot pay homage enough, either to God or to His noble manhood, nor
   can it abase itself as much as it would. And that is why a humble man
   thinks that his worship of God and his lowly service are always falling
   short. And he is meek, reverencing Holy Church and the sacraments. And
   he is discreet in food and drink, in speech, in the answers which he
   makes to everybody; and in his behaviour, dress, and lowly service he
   is without hypocrisy and without pretence. And he is humble in his
   devotions, both outwardly and inwardly, before God and before all men,
   so that none are offended because of him. And so he overcomes and casts
   out Pride, which is the source and origin of all other sins. By
   humility the snares of the devil, and of sin, and of the world, are
   broken, and man is set in order, and established in the very condition
   of virtue. And heaven is opened to him, and God stoops to hear his
   prayers, and he is fulfilled with grace. And Christ, that strong rock,
   is his foundation. Whosoever therefore grounds his virtues in humility,
   he shall never err.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XIII

  OF OBEDIENCE

   From this humility there springs obedience, for none can be inwardly
   obedient save the humble man.

   Obedience means an unassuming, submissive, and pliable humour, and a
   will in readiness for all that is good. Obedience makes a man submit to
   the biddings, the forbiddings, and the will of God; it subjects the
   senses and the animal powers to the higher reason, so that a man may
   live decently and reasonably. And it makes men submissive and obedient
   to Holy Church, to the sacraments, to the prelates and their teaching,
   to their commandments and their counsels, and to all the good customs
   practised by Holy Christendom. It also makes a man ready and supple in
   his intercourse with other men, in deed and counsel, in ghostly and
   bodily business, with prudent discretion, according to the needs of
   each.

   And it casts out disobedience, that daughter of pride, more to be
   abhorred than venom or poison. To be obedient in will and deed adorns
   and enlarges and reveals the humility of a man. It makes peace in the
   cloister. If it is in the prelate, as it ought to be, it will draw to
   him all those whom he rules. It makes for peace and unanimity between
   equals; and he who has it is loved by his superiors and by those who
   are set over him; whilst by God he is advanced, and enriched with His
   gifts, which are eternal.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XIV

  OF THE RENUNCIATION OF SELF WILL

   From this obedience there springs the renunciation of one's own will
   and one's own opinion, for none can submit his own will in all things
   to the will of another, save the obedient man: though one may obey in
   outward things and yet remain self-willed.

   The forsaking of one's own will causes a man to live without preference
   for either this or that, in doing or leaving undone, in those things
   which are strange and special in the saints, in their precepts and in
   their practice; but it makes him to live always according to the glory
   and the commandments of God, and the will of his prelates, and in peace
   with all men in his neighbourhood, so far as true prudence permits.

   By renouncing self-will in doing, in leaving undone, and in suffering,
   the material and occasion of pride are wholly cast out, and humility is
   made perfect in the highest degree. And God becomes the Lord of the
   man's whole will; and the man's will is so united with the will of God
   that he can neither will nor desire in any other way. This man has put
   off the old man, and has put on the new man, who is renewed and made
   according to the dearest will of God. Of all such Christ says: Blessed
   are the poor in spirit--that is to say, those who have renounced
   self-will--for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. [41]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [41] It will be seen that the description of the virtues in this
   section, like that of the terraces in Dante's Purgatorio, is arranged
   upon a definite plan. Each virtue or group of qualities opposes one of
   the seven mortal sins, and is associated with one of the Beatitudes.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XV

  OF PATIENCE

   From the renunciation of self-will springs patience; for none can be
   perfectly patient in all things save the man who has subjected his own
   will to the will of God, and also in all profitable and seemly things,
   to the will of all other men.

   Patience is a peaceful endurance of all things that may befall a man
   either from God or from the creatures. Nothing can trouble the patient
   man; neither the loss of earthly goods, of friends and kinsmen, nor
   sickness, nor disgrace, nor life, nor death, nor purgatory, nor devil,
   nor hell. For he has abandoned himself in perfect charity to the will
   of God, and as he is not burdened by mortal sin, everything that God
   imposes on him, in time and in eternity, is light to him. By this
   patience a man is also adorned and armed against peevishness and sudden
   wrath, and impatience in suffering; which often stir a man from within
   and from without, and lay him open to many temptations.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XVI

  OF MEEKNESS

   From this patience there spring meekness and kindliness, for none can
   be meek in adversity save the patient man.

   Meekness gives a man peace and rest in all things. For the meek man can
   bear provoking words and ways, uncivil looks and deeds, and every kind
   of injustice towards himself and his friends, and yet in all things
   remain in peace, for meekness is peaceful endurance.

   By meekness the irascible or repulsive power remains unmoved, in
   quietude; the desirous power is uplifted toward virtue; the rational
   power, perceiving this, rejoices. And the conscience, tasting it, rests
   in peace; for the second mortal sin, Anger, fury, or wrath, has been
   cast out. For the Spirit of God dwells in the humble and the meek; and
   Christ says: Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth,
   that is, their own nature and all earthly things, in meekness; and
   after that the Country of Life in Eternity.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XVII

  OF KINDLINESS

   Out of the same source wherein meekness takes its rise springs
   kindliness, for none can be kind save the meek man.

   This kindness makes a man show a friendly face, and give a cordial
   response, and do compassionate deeds, to those who are quarrelsome,
   when he hopes that they will come to know themselves and mend their
   ways.

   By gentleness and kindness, charity is kept quick and fruitful in man,
   for a heart full of kindness is like a lamp full of precious oil; for
   the oil of mercy enlightens the erring sinner with good example, and
   with words and works of comfort it anoints and heals those whose hearts
   are wounded or grieved or perplexed. And it is a fire and a light for
   those who dwell in the virtues, in the fire of charity; and neither
   jealousy nor envy can perturb it.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XVIII

  OF COMPASSION

   Out of kindliness springs compassion, which is a fellow-feeling with
   all men; for none can share the griefs of all, save him who is kind.

   Compassion is an inward movement of the heart, stirred by pity for the
   bodily and ghostly griefs of all men. This compassion makes a man
   suffer with Christ in His passion; for he who is compassionate marks
   the wherefore of His pains and the way of His resignation; of His love,
   His wounds, His tenderness; of His grief and His nobleness; of the
   disgrace, the misery, and the shame He endured; of the way in which He
   was despised; of His crown; of the nails; of His mercifulness; of His
   destruction and dying in patience. These manifold and unheard-of
   sorrows of Christ, our Saviour and our Bridegroom, move all kindly men
   to pity and compassion with Christ.

   Compassion makes a man look into himself, and recognize his faults, his
   feebleness in virtues and in the worship of God, his lukewarmness, his
   laziness, his many failings, the time he has wasted and his present
   imperfection in moral and other virtues; all this makes a man feel true
   pity and compassion for himself. Further, compassion marks the errors
   and disorders of our fellow-creatures, how little they care for their
   God and their eternal blessedness, their ingratitude for all the good
   things which God has done for them, and the pains He suffered for their
   sake; how they are strangers to virtue, unskilled and unpractised in
   it, but skilful and cunning in every wickedness; how attentive they are
   to the loss and gain of earthly goods, how careless and reckless they
   are of God, of eternal things, and their eternal bliss. When he marks
   this, a good man is moved to compassion for the salvation of all men.

   Such a man will also regard with pity the bodily needs of his
   neighbours, and the manifold sufferings of human nature; seeing men
   hungry, thirsty, cold, naked, sick, poor, and abject; the manifold
   oppressions of the poor, the grief caused by loss of kinsmen, friends,
   goods, honour, peace; all the countless sorrows which befall the nature
   of man. These things move the just to compassion, so that they share
   the sorrows of all. But their greatest pain springs from this: that men
   are so impatient of this suffering, that they lose their reward, and
   may often earn hell for themselves. Such is the work of compassion and
   of pity.

   This work of compassion and of common neighbourly love overcomes and
   casts out the third mortal sin, that is hatred or Envy. For compassion
   is a wound in the heart, whence flows a common love to all mankind and
   which cannot be healed so long as any suffering lives in man; for God
   has ordained grief and sorrow of heart before all the virtues. And this
   is why Christ says: Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be
   comforted. And that shall come to pass when they reap in joy that which
   now, through compassion and pity, they sow in tears.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XIX

  OF GENEROSITY

   From this compassion springs generosity; for none can be generous in a
   supernatural way, with faithfulness and goodwill towards all, save him
   who has a pitiful heart--though a man may often show generosity to a
   particular person without charity and without supernatural generosity.

   Generosity is a liberal flowing forth of the heart which has been
   touched by charity and pity. When a man considers with compassion the
   sufferings and the sorrows of Christ, therefrom springs generosity;
   which makes him offer to Christ, for His pains and for His love, praise
   and thanks, worship and adoration, with a joyful and humble surrender
   of body and soul, in time and in eternity. If a man considers himself
   with compassion, and has pity on himself, and thinks upon the good
   which God has done to him, and his own failings: then he must pour
   himself forth into the generosity of God, taking refuge in His
   faithfulness and His mercy, turning to Him with trust and with a
   perfect and free intention to serve Him for evermore. And the generous
   man who sees the errors and disorders of others, and their
   unrighteousness, beseeches and prays God, with ardent faith, that He
   will let His Divine gifts flow forth, that He will show His generosity
   to all men, and they may know Him and turn to the Truth. The generous
   man also marks with compassion the bodily needs of all men, and he
   serves, and he gives, and he lends, and he consoles everyone, according
   to the needs of each, in so far as he is able, with prudent discretion.

   Because of this generosity men are wont to practise the seven works of
   mercy; the rich do them by their alms and because of their riches, the
   poor by their good-will and by their hearty desire to do as the rich if
   they could. And thus the virtue of generosity is made perfect.

   By generosity of heart all other virtues are increased, and all the
   powers of the soul are adorned; for the generous man is always blithe
   in spirit and untroubled of heart, and he flows forth with desire and
   in his works of virtue, to all men in common. Whosoever is generous,
   and loves not earthly goods how poor soever he be, he is like God: for
   all that he has in himself, and all that he feels, flow forth and are
   given away. And in this way he has cast out the fourth mortal sin,
   which is covetousness or Avarice. Of all such Christ says: Blessed are
   the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy in that day when they shall
   hear these words: Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom
   prepared for you--because of your mercy,--from the foundation of the
   world.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XX

  OF ZEAL AND DILIGENCE

   Out of this generosity there spring a supernatural zeal and diligence
   in all virtues and all that is seemly. And none can feel this zeal save
   him who overflows with generosity. It is an inward restless striving
   after every virtue, after the likeness of Christ and of all His saints.
   In this zeal a man longs to devote his heart and his senses, his soul
   and his body, and all that he is, and all that he has and all toward
   which he aspires, to the glory and praise of God.

   This zeal makes a man grow in reason and prudence, and practise the
   virtues, both of soul and of body, in righteousness. Through this
   supernatural zeal all the powers of the soul are laid open to God, and
   are made ready for all virtues. And the conscience rejoices, and the
   grace of God is increased; the virtues are practised with joy and
   gladness, and the outward works are adorned.

   Whosoever has received this living zeal from God has cast out the fifth
   mortal sin, which is indolence of the mind or Sloth, as regards the
   virtues which it is needful that we should practise. And sometimes,
   this living zeal also casts out the sloth and indolence of the natural
   body. Of all such Christ says: Blessed are they which do hunger and
   thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled, and this shall
   come to pass when the glory of God shall be manifest to them, and shall
   fill them, each according to his love and righteousness.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXI

  OF TEMPERANCE AND SOBRIETY

   From this zeal there spring temperance and sobriety, both inward and
   outward; for none can possess the right measure of sobriety save him
   who is greatly zealous and diligent to keep his soul and body in
   righteousness. Sobriety divides the higher powers from the animal
   powers; it saves a man from intemperance and from excess. Sobriety
   wishes neither to taste, nor to know, those things which are forbidden.

   The incomprehensible and most high Nature of God transcends all
   creatures in heaven and on earth. For all that a creature can
   comprehend is of the creature; but God is above all creatures and
   within and without all creatures, and every created comprehension is
   too narrow to comprehend Him. But if a creature is to comprehend and to
   understand God, it must be caught up beyond itself into God, and
   comprehend God with God. Whosoever then would know and understand what
   God is--which is not permitted--he would go mad. Behold, all created
   light is powerless to know what God is. What God is in Himself,
   transcends all creatures, but that God exists, is testified by nature,
   and by Holy Writ, and by every creature. We should believe the articles
   of faith, and not desire to understand them, for this is impossible as
   long as we are here below: such is sobriety. The mysterious and subtle
   teachings of Holy Writ, inspired by the Holy Ghost, should not be
   explained and understood in any other way than in their bearing upon
   the lives of Christ and His saints. Man should consider nature, and the
   Scriptures, and all creatures, and take from these that which profits
   him and nothing more. Such is sobriety of spirit.

   A man should keep his senses in sobriety and should restrain the animal
   powers by means of the reason; so that the lusts of the flesh do not
   enter too far into the savouring of food and of drink; but he should
   eat and drink as the sick take their physic, because it is needful to
   support his strength, that he may serve God therewith. This is sobriety
   of body. He should also observe method and moderation in doing and in
   leaving undone, in words and in works, in silence and in speaking, in
   food and in drink, according to the custom of Holy Church, and after
   the example of the saints.

   By inward and ghostly temperance and sobriety a man preserves firmness
   and constancy of faith, purity of intelligence, that tranquillity of
   reason necessary to the comprehension of truth, an impulse towards all
   virtues according to the will of God, peace of heart, and serenity of
   conscience. And herewith he possesses an enduring peace, in God and in
   himself.

   And by temperance and sobriety of the outward bodily senses, a man
   often preserves the health and the soundness of his natural body, the
   dignity of his outward life, and a good reputation. And thus he lives
   in peace with himself and with his neighbours; for by his temperance
   and sobriety he draws to himself and pleases all men of good-will. And
   thus he casts out the sixth mortal sin, which is intemperance, greed or
   Gluttony. Of all such Christ says: Blessed are the peacemakers: for
   they shall be called the children of God; for they are like unto the
   Son, Who has made peace in every creature who desired peace. And
   whosoever makes peace in himself through his temperance and sobriety
   shall partake with Him of the inheritance of His Father; and shall
   possess it with Him in eternity.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXII

  OF PURITY

   From this temperance there springs purity both of soul and of body, for
   none can be perfectly pure in body and in soul save him who is
   temperate in body and in soul.

   Purity of spirit is this: that a man should not cleave to any creature
   with desirous affection, but to God alone; for we should use all
   creatures, but enjoy only God. Purity of spirit makes a man cleave to
   God, above all understanding, and above all feelings, and above all the
   gifts which God may pour into his soul: for all that a creature
   receives in his understanding and in his feeling, purity will pass by,
   to rest in God. Go therefore to the Sacrament of the Altar, not for the
   sake of refreshment, nor because of desire, nor for pleasure, nor for
   peace, nor for satisfaction, nor for sweetness, nor for anything else
   than the glory of God and your own growth in all virtues. This is
   purity of spirit.

   Purity of heart is this: that a man, in every bodily temptation or
   natural inclination, of his own free will, and with an ever-renewed
   confidence and without hesitation, turns to God; with an ever-renewed
   faithfulness and with a firm will ever to remain with Him. For
   consenting to those sins or satisfactions, which the bodily nature
   seeks like a beast, is a departure from God.

   Purity of body is this: that a man withdraws from, and bewares of, all
   unchaste deeds, in whatsoever manner they be, which his conscience
   teaches and declares to be unchaste, and contrary to the commandments,
   the honour, and the will of God.

   By these three kinds of purity the seventh mortal sin is overcome and
   cast out; that is, Unchastity. And this is a consenting and turning of
   the spirit from God to some creaturely thing; it is the unchaste work
   of the body contrary to the dispensation of Holy Church; it is a
   sensual dwelling of the heart upon the taste or enjoyment of some
   creature, whatsoever it be. But thereby I do not mean those sudden
   movements of appetite and desire, which no one can prevent.

   Now you should know that purity of spirit keeps a man in the likeness
   of God, untroubled by any creature and inclined towards God, and united
   with Him.

   Purity of body is likened to the whiteness of lilies and to the
   cleanness of the angels. In withstanding, it is likened to the redness
   of roses and to the nobleness of martyrs. If it is kept for the love
   and the glory of God, it is perfect. And so it is likened to the
   sunflower, for it is one of the highest ornaments of nature.

   Purity of heart works a renewal and increase of the grace of God. By
   purity of heart all the virtues are prompted, practised and preserved.
   It guards and keeps the senses from without; it quells and restrains
   the animal lusts from within; it is an adornment of all inwardness. And
   it is the door of the heart; barred against all earthly things and all
   deceit, but opened to all heavenly things and to all truth. And of all
   such Christ says: Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see
   God; and in this vision consist our eternal joy, our reward and our
   entrance into bliss. Therefore men should be sober and temperate in all
   things, and beware of all intercourse and occasion whereby purity,
   whether of soul or of body, may be defiled.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXIII

  OF THREE ENEMIES TO BE OVERCOME BY RIGHTEOUSNESS

   Now, if we wish to possess these virtues, and to cast out their
   opposites, we must possess righteousness, and we must practise and
   preserve it in purity of heart unto death; for we have three powerful
   adversaries, who tempt us and make war on us at all times, in all
   places, and in many ways. If we make peace with one of these three, and
   become subject to him, we are vanquished; for the three of them agree
   together in all iniquity.

   These three adversaries are the devil, the world and our own flesh; and
   this last is the nearest to us and often the worst and most harmful of
   all three to us; for our fleshly lusts are the weapons with which our
   enemies make war on us. Idleness and indifference to virtue and the
   glory of God, these are the causes and the occasions of the struggle.
   But the weakness of our nature, our carelessness and ignorance of
   truth, these are the swords with which our enemies often wound, and
   sometimes conquer us.

   And for this reason we should build up a wall and make a separation
   within ourselves. And the lower part of ourselves, which is beastly and
   contrary to the virtues, and which wills our separation from God, we
   should hate and persecute, and we should torment it by means of
   penances and austerity of life; so that it be always repressed, and
   subject to reason, that thereby righteousness and purity of heart may
   always have the upper hand in all the works of virtue. And all the
   suffering, grief, and persecution, which God sends us through these
   enemies of virtue, we should gladly bear for the glory of God, and for
   the honour of the virtues, and that we may obtain and possess
   righteousness in purity of heart; for Christ says: Blessed are they
   which are persecuted for righteousness sake: for theirs is the Kingdom
   of Heaven. For a righteousness which is maintained in suffering and in
   virtuous deeds is like the penny which is counted as heavy as the
   kingdom of God; and with it is bought eternal life.

   And with these virtues a man goes out towards God, towards himself, and
   towards his neighbour, in good customs, in virtues, and in
   righteousness.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXIV

  OF THE KINGDOM OF THE SOUL

   Whosoever wishes to obtain and to keep these virtues should adorn and
   possess and rule his soul like a kingdom. Free-will is the king of the
   soul. It is free by nature and still more free by grace. It shall be
   crowned with a crown that is called charity. The crown and the kingdom
   shall be received from the Emperor, Who is Lord and Master and King of
   kings; and the kingdom should be possessed, ruled, and maintained in
   His name. This king, free-will, should dwell in the chief city of the
   kingdom; namely, in the desirous power of the soul. And he should be
   clad and adorned with a garment of two parts. The right side of his
   garment should be a virtue called strength, that therewith he may be
   strong and mighty to overcome all hindrances, and to ascend up to
   heaven, into the palace of the most high Emperor, and to bow down his
   crowned head before the most high King, with love, and with
   self-surrendered desire. This is the proper work of charity: through it
   the crown is received, through it the crown is adorned, through it the
   kingdom is maintained and possessed in eternity. The left side of the
   garment should be a cardinal virtue called moral force. Through it,
   free-will, the king, shall quell all immorality, and fulfil all
   virtues, and shall possess his kingdom in power, even unto death.

   This king should also choose councillors in his kingdom: the wisest in
   the country. These should be two divine virtues: knowledge and
   discretion, enlightened by the light of Divine grace. They should dwell
   near the king, in a palace called the rational power of the soul, and
   they should be clad and adorned with a moral virtue called temperance,
   so that the king may always do or leave undone according to their
   counsels. By means of knowledge our conscience shall be cleansed of all
   its failings and adorned with all virtues; and by help of discretion we
   shall give and take, do and leave undone, be silent and speak, fast and
   eat, listen and reply, and act in all things according to knowledge and
   discretion, clad in the moral virtue called temperance or sobriety.

   This king, free-will, should also appoint in his kingdom a judge: that
   is, righteousness. This is a divine virtue when it springs from love,
   and it is one of the highest of moral virtues. This judge should dwell
   in the heart, in the midst of the kingdom, in the irascible power. And
   he should be adorned with a moral virtue called prudence; for
   righteousness cannot be perfect without prudence. This judge,
   righteousness, should travel through the kingdom with the king's own
   power and majesty, and furnished with the wisdom of the councillors,
   and with his own prudence. And he should set up and cast down, judge
   and condemn, kill and leave alive, put to the torture, blind and
   restore sight, raise and suppress, scourge and chastise, extirpate all
   vices, and order all things according to righteousness.

   The common people of the kingdom are all the other powers of the soul,
   which should be grounded in humility and godly fear, and should be
   subject to God in all virtues, each power according to its own
   character.

   Whosoever possesses, maintains, and has ordered, the kingdom of his
   soul in this way, has gone out with love and with virtue towards God,
   towards himself and towards his neighbour.

   And this is the third of the four principal points which we would
   consider.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXV

  OF A SPIRITUAL MEETING OF GOD AND OURSELVES

   When a man through the grace of God is able to behold, and his
   conscience is clean, and he has considered the three comings of Christ
   our Bridegroom, and when he has gone out with the virtues: then there
   ensues the meeting with the Bridegroom, and that is the fourth point
   and the last. In this meeting lies all our bliss, the beginning and end
   of all virtue; and without this meeting no virtue has ever been
   fulfilled.

   Whosoever wishes to meet Christ as his beloved Bridegroom, and to
   possess in Him, and with Him, eternal life; he must now, in time, go
   out to meet Christ at three points or in three ways. The first point is
   that he shall have God in mind in all things through which we earn
   eternal life. The second point is that there shall be nothing that he
   means or loves more than God or even so much as God. And the third
   point is that he shall with great zeal seek to rest in God, above all
   creatures and above all God's gifts, above all the works of virtue and
   above all feelings that God may infuse into soul and body.

   Now grasp this well: whosoever means God must have God present in his
   mind under some godly attribute; and thereby he should mean only Him
   Who is the Lord of heaven and earth and all creatures, Who died for
   him, and Who can, and will, give him eternal bliss. In whatever way or
   under whatever name we represent God to ourselves, if it be as the Lord
   over all creatures, that is always right. If we conceive one of the
   Divine Persons, and in Him the being and the might of the Divine
   Nature, that is right. If we set God before us as Maintainer, Redeemer,
   Creator, Ruler; as Bliss, Power, Wisdom, Truth, Goodness, and all this
   as within the abysmal properties of the Divine Nature, that is right.

   Though the names which we give to God are many, the most high Nature of
   God is a Simplicity which cannot be named by any creature. But because
   of His incomprehensible nobility and sublimity, which we cannot rightly
   name nor wholly express, we give Him all these names. This is the way
   and the manner of apprehension in which we should have God present in
   our mind; for, to mean God, this is to see God in ghostly wise. And to
   this intention charity and love also belong; for to know God and to be
   without charity has no savour, neither does it help or further us. That
   is why a man should always in all his works stretch towards God with
   love; Whom, above all things, he aims at and loves. And this is going
   out to meet God by intention and by love.

   If a sinner would turn from his sins with full and true repentance, he
   must go out to meet God in contrition and of his own free-will, and
   with an upright purpose and intention to serve Him thenceforward and
   never to sin any more. Then, in this meeting, he shall receive through
   the mercy of God a sure hope of eternal bliss and the remission of his
   sins; and he shall further receive the foundation of all virtue:
   namely, Faith, Hope, and Charity, and a good-will toward all other
   virtues.

   If this man wishes to go forward in the light of faith, and lay hold of
   all the works of Christ, and all His suffering; all the things He
   promised us and did to us and will do to us until the Day of Doom and
   in eternity; if that man wishes to lay hold of these that they may
   avail to his salvation: then he should go out to meet Christ once more,
   and should have Him ever in his sight, with praise and thankfulness and
   with a worthy acknowledgment of all His gifts, and all that He has
   done, and will do, in eternity. Then his faith will be strengthened;
   and he will be more often, and more ardently impelled towards all
   virtues.

   If, then, he wishes to go forward in the works of virtue, he must also
   go out to meet Christ with self-renunciation, neither seeking himself,
   nor pursuing things alien from God; but let him be wise and discreet in
   all that he does, having in mind in all things God alone, and God's
   praise and glory, and let him continue therein even unto death. Thereby
   his reason is enlightened, and his charity is increased, and he grows
   in piety and in the aptitude for all virtues.

   We should have God in mind in all our good works; in evil works we
   cannot do this. We should not have in mind two ends; that is to say, we
   should mean God alone and nothing else. All other ends should be
   subordinate to God, not opposed to God; they should be, in their order,
   a help and a furtherance, that we may the better come to God. And then
   we are in the right way.

   We should also rather seek our rest upon Him and in Him Whom we mean
   and love, than in any of the messengers He sends; that is to say, His
   gifts. The soul should also rest in God above all the jewels and all
   the gifts which it may send back to God by its own messengers. The
   messengers of the soul are intention, love, and desire: these carry all
   good deeds and all virtues up to God. But above all these things, above
   all multiplicity, the soul should rest in its Beloved. In this way and
   in this wise we should go out to meet Christ with an upright intention
   during all our lives, and in all our works, and in all our virtues; so
   that we may also meet Him in the light of glory at the hour of death.

   This method and this way, of which you have now heard, is called the
   Active Life. It is needful for all men; and these, at least, should not
   live contrary to virtue, even though they may not possess all the
   virtues in this perfection. For, to live contrary to virtue is to live
   in sin; for Christ says: He that is not with Me is against Me.
   Whosoever is not humble, he is proud; and whosoever is proud and not
   humble does not belong to God. And thus it is with all the sins and all
   the virtues; either a man has the virtue and lives in grace, or else he
   has its opposite and lives in sin. Let each man try himself, and live
   according to that which has here been shown.

CHAPTER XXVI

  OF THE DESIRE TO KNOW THE BRIDEGROOM IN HIS NATURE

   A Man who lives this life in its perfection, as it has here been shown,
   and who is offering up his whole life, and all his works, to the
   worship and praise of God, and who wills and loves God above all
   things, is often stirred by a desire to see, to know, and to prove
   what, in Himself, this Bridegroom Christ is; Who for man's sake became
   man and laboured in love unto death, and delivered us from sin and the
   devil, and has given us Himself and His grace, and left us His
   sacraments, and has promised us His kingdom and Himself as an eternal
   wage; Who also gives us all that is needful for the body, and inward
   consolation and sweetness, and innumerable gifts of all kinds,
   according to the needs of each.

   When a man beholds all this, he feels an unmeasured impulse to see
   Christ his Bridegroom, and to know Him as He is in Himself. Though he
   knows Him in His works, this does not seem to him enough. Then he must
   do as the publican Zaccheus did, who longed to see Jesus, who He was.
   He must run before the crowd, that is the multiplicity of creatures;
   for these make us so little and so low that we cannot see God. And he
   must climb up into the tree of faith, which grows from above downwards,
   for its roots are in the Godhead. This tree has twelve branches, which
   are the twelve articles of faith. The lower speak of the Divine
   Humanity, and of those things which belong to our salvation of soul and
   of body. The upper part of the tree tells of the Godhead, of the
   Trinity of Persons, and of the Unity of the Nature of God. And the man
   must cling to that unity, in the highest part of the tree; for there it
   is that Jesus must pass with all His gifts.

   Here comes Jesus, and sees the man, and shows to him, in the light of
   faith, that He is according to His Godhead immeasurable and
   incomprehensible and inaccessible and abysmal, transcending every
   created light and every finite conception. And this is the highest
   knowledge of God which any man may have in the active life: that he
   should confess in this light of faith that God is incomprehensible and
   unknowable. And in this light Christ says to man's desire: Make haste
   and come down, for to-day I must abide at thy house. This hasty
   descent, to which he is summoned by God, is nothing else than a descent
   through desire and through love into the abyss of the Godhead, which no
   intelligence can reach in the created light. But where intelligence
   remains without, desire and love go in. When the soul is thus stretched
   towards God, by intention and by love, above everything that it can
   understand, then it rests and dwells in God, and God in it. When the
   soul climbs with desire above the multiplicity of creatures, and above
   the works of the senses, and above the light of nature, then it meets
   Christ in the light of faith, and becomes enlightened, and confesses
   that God is unknowable and incomprehensible. When it stretches itself
   with longing towards this incomprehensible God, then it meets Christ,
   and is filled with His gifts. And when it loves and rests above all
   gifts, and above itself, and above all creatures, then it dwells in
   God, and God dwells in it.

   This is the way in which we shall meet Christ on the summit of the
   active life. When you have laid the foundation of righteousness,
   charity, and humility; and have established on it a dwelling-place,
   that is, those virtues which have been named heretofore; and have met
   Christ through faith, by intention and by love; then you dwell in God
   and God dwells in you, and you possess the true active life.

   And this was the first of which we would speak.

     __________________________________________________________________

PROLOGUE

   The wise virgin, that is the pure soul, having abandoned earthly
   things, and living according to the virtues for God, has taken in the
   vessel of her heart the oil of charity and of godly deeds, with the
   lamp of an unsullied conscience. But when Christ the Bridegroom tarries
   with His consolations, and the renewed inpouring of His gifts, the soul
   becomes drowsy, sleepy, and inert. Then, at midnight, when it is least
   expected, a ghostly cry is made within the soul: Behold, the
   Bridegroom, cometh, go ye out to meet Him. Of this beholding, and of
   the inward coming of Christ, and of a man's ghostly going out, and of
   his meeting with Christ; of these four points we will now speak, and we
   will explain and apply them according to an inward, lofty, God-desiring
   life, which all cannot reach, but which many men attain through the
   moral virtues and inward zeal.

   By these words Christ teaches us four things. First, that He wills that
   our understanding should be enlightened by supernatural light; this we
   learn from the word which He speaks: Behold. Secondly, He shows us what
   we ought to see: namely, the inward coming of our Bridegroom, the
   Eternal Truth; this we understand from His saying: The Bridegroom
   cometh. Thirdly, He commands us to go out through inward exercises
   according to righteousness; for this reason He says: Go ye out. And, by
   the fourth point, He shows us the end and the aim of the whole; that
   is, the meeting with our Bridegroom Christ, in the fruitive unity of
   the Godhead.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER I

  HOW WE ACHIEVE SUPERNATURAL SIGHT IN OUR INWARD WORKINGS

   Now concerning the first point. Christ says: Behold. Whosoever wishes
   to see in a supernatural way in his inward exercises must have three
   things. The first is the light of Divine grace, and this in a more
   lofty degree than that which we can experience in the outward and
   active life without earnest inward diligence. The second thing is the
   casting out of all distracting images and attachments from the heart;
   so that the man may be free and imageless, released from all
   attachments, and empty of all creatures. The third thing is a free
   turning of the will, with a gathering together of all our powers, both
   bodily and ghostly, cleansed from every inordinate love. Thereby the
   will flows forth into the unity of God and into the unity of the mind;
   and thus the rational creature may obtain and possess the most high
   unity of God in a supernatural manner. For this God has created heaven
   and earth and everything; and for this reason He became man, and taught
   us, and lived for our sake, and has Himself become the Way to the
   unity. And He died in the bonds of love, and has ascended and has
   opened to us that very unity, in which we may possess eternal bliss.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER II

  OF A THREE-FOLD UNITY WHICH IS IN US BY NATURE

   Now mark this with diligence: a threefold unity is found in all men by
   nature, and also in all good men according to a supernatural manner.

   The first and highest unity of man is in God; for all creatures depend
   upon this unity for their being, their life, and their preservation;
   and if they be separated in this wise from God, they fall into the
   nothingness and become nought. This unity is in us essentially, by
   nature, whether we be good or evil. And without our own working it
   makes us neither holy nor blessed. This unity we possess within us and
   yet above us, as the ground and the preserver of our being and of our
   life.

   The second unity or union is also in us by nature. It is the unity of
   our higher powers; forasmuch as these spring naturally as active powers
   from the unity of the mind or of the spirit. This is that same unity
   which depends upon God; but with this difference, that here it is
   active and there essential. Nevertheless, the spirit is wholly and
   perfectly understood according to the fulness of its substance, in each
   unity. This unity we possess within us, above our senses; and from it
   there proceed memory, understanding, and will, and all the powers of
   ghostly action. In this unity, the soul is called "spirit."

   The third unity which is in us by nature is the source of all the
   bodily powers, in the unity of the heart; origin and beginning of the
   bodily life. This unity the soul possesses in the body and in the
   quickening centre of the heart, and therefrom flow forth all bodily
   activities, and the five senses. And therein the soul is called "soul";
   for it is the forming principle of the body, and quickens this carcase;
   that is, gives it life and keeps it therein.

   These three unities abide in man by nature as one life and one kingdom.
   In the lowest we are sensible and animal; in the middle we are rational
   and spiritual; and in the highest we are kept according to our essence.
   And thus are all men by nature.

   Now these three unities, as one kingdom and one eternal dwelling-place,
   are adorned and inhabited in a supernatural way by the moral virtues
   through charity and the active life. And they are still more gloriously
   adorned and more excellently perfected by inward exercises united with
   a spiritual life. But they are most gloriously and blessedly adorned by
   a supernatural and contemplative life.

   The lowest unity, being of the body, is supernaturally adorned and
   perfected through outward works and moral perfection, according to the
   way of Christ and His saints: and through bearing the cross with
   Christ, and through subordinating nature discreetly according to its
   powers to the commandments of Holy Church and to the doctrines of the
   saints.

   The second unity, being in the spirit and wholly spiritual, is
   supernaturally adorned and perfected through the three divine virtues,
   Faith, Hope, and Charity; and through the inflow of the grace and the
   gifts of God; and through a good-will to follow the examples of Christ
   and Holy Christendom in all virtues.

   The third and highest unity is above the comprehension of our reason,
   and yet essentially within us. We possess it in a supernatural way when
   in all our works of virtue we have in mind the praise and glory of God,
   and above all aims, above ourselves, and above all things would rest
   only in Him. This is that unity wherefrom we have come forth as
   creatures, and wherein, according to our being, we are at home. And by
   means of the virtues here named, these three unities are adorned in the
   active life.

   Now we will show how these three unities are more highly adorned and
   more nobly fostered through an inward exercise joined to the active
   life. Whenever a man, because of his charity and his upright intention,
   lifts himself up with all his works and with his whole life toward the
   glory and the praise of God, ever seeking to rest in God above all
   things: then, in humble patience and self-surrender, yet with a sure
   trust, he will await new riches and new gifts, but without anxiety as
   to whether it be God's good pleasure to give or not to give.

   In this way one prepares and makes oneself ready to enter on the inward
   and God-desiring life. And, when the vessel is made ready, then the
   noble vintage is poured into it. And there is no vessel more noble than
   the loving soul, neither a vintage more wholesome than the grace of
   God. So a man should devote all his acts and all life to God, with a
   simple and upright intention directed to God; and should rest, above
   intentions, and above himself, and above all things in that most high
   unity, in which God and the loving spirit are united without
   intermediary.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER III

  OF THE INFLOW OF THE GRACE OF GOD INTO OUR SPIRIT

   From this unity, wherein the spirit is united with God without
   intermediary, grace and all gifts flow forth: and out of this same
   unity, where the spirit rests above itself in God, Christ the Eternal
   Truth says: Behold, The Bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet Him.
   Christ, who is the light of Eternal Truth, says: Behold: for through
   Him we become seeing; for He is the light of the Father, and without
   Him there were no light, neither in heaven nor on earth. This speaking
   of Christ within us is nothing else than an inrush of His light and His
   grace. This grace pours into us in the unity of our higher powers and
   of our spirit; wherefrom, through the power of the grace received, the
   higher powers flow out to become active in all virtues, and whereto,
   because of the bond of love, they ever return again.

   In this unity lie the power for, and beginning and end of, every
   natural and supernatural work of the creature in so far as it is
   wrought in a creaturely way, through grace and Divine gifts, and by the
   creature's own strength. And therefore God pours His grace into the
   unity of the higher powers, that therewith man may always fulfil the
   virtues, through the power and the richness and the thrust of grace.
   For God gives us grace, therewith to work; and above all graces He
   gives Himself, for fruition and for rest. The unity of our spirit is
   our dwelling-place, in the peace of God and in the riches of charity;
   and there all the manifold virtues are gathered together, and live in
   the simplicity of the spirit.

   Now the grace of God, pouring forth from God, is an inward thrust and
   urge of the Holy Ghost, driving forth our spirit from within and
   exciting it towards all virtues. This grace flows from within, and not
   from without; for God is more inward to us than we are to ourselves,
   and His inward thrust or working within us, be it natural or
   supernatural, is nearer to us and more intimate to us, than our own
   working is. And therefore God works in us from within outwards; but all
   creatures work from without inwards. And thus it is that grace, and all
   the gifts of God, and the Voice of God, come from within, in the unity
   of our spirit; and not from without, into the imagination, by means of
   sensible images.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER IV

  SHOWING HOW WE SHOULD FOUND OUR INWARD LIFE ON A FREEDOM FROM IMAGES

   Now Christ says in ghostly wise in the man who is turned within:
   Behold. Three things, as I have said, make a man seeing in his inward
   exercise. The first is a shining forth of the grace of God. The grace
   of God in a soul is like a candle in a lantern or in a glass vessel;
   for it enlightens, and brightens, and shines through, the vessel, that
   is, the righteous man. And it manifests itself to the man who has it
   within him, if he be observant of himself. And it manifests itself
   through him, to other men, in virtues and in good example. This flash
   of divine grace inwardly stirs and moves a man with swiftness, and this
   swift movement is the first thing which makes us see. Of this swift
   movement of God there springs from the side of man the second thing,
   which is a gathering together of all inward and outward powers in the
   unity of the spirit, in the bonds of love. The third point is the
   freedom which allows the man to turn inwards, without hindrance from
   sensible images, as often as he wills and thinks upon his God. This
   means that a man must be indifferent to gladness and grief, profit and
   loss, rising and falling, to strange cares, to delight and to dread,
   and never be attached to any creature. These three things make a man
   seeing in his inward exercise. If you have these three, you have the
   foundation and the beginning of the inward practice and the inward
   life. [42]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [42] The three points here described--the enlightenment or impulse of
   grace, concentration of mind, and the deliberate expulsion of
   distracting thoughts and images--are summed up in the exercise which
   ascetic writers call Recollection, and which prepares consciousness for
   the contemplative state.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER V

  OF A THREE-FOLD COMING OF OUR LORD IN THE INWARD MAN

   Even though the eye be clear and the sight keen, if there were no
   loveworthy and desirable object, clearness of sight would neither
   please nor profit a man. And this is why Christ shows to the
   enlightened eyes of the understanding what they shall see, to wit, the
   inward coming of Christ their Bridegroom.

   Three ways of this special inward coming of God are found in those men
   who exercise themselves with devotion in the inward life; and each of
   these three comings raises a man to a higher degree and to a more
   inward exercise.

   The first coming of Christ in inward working drives and urges a man in
   his inward feeling; it draws him with all his powers upwards to heaven,
   and it calls him to unite himself with God. This driving and drawing we
   feel in the heart, and in the unity of all the bodily powers, and
   especially in the desirous power. For this coming stirs, and works in,
   the lower part of man; for this must be wholly purged and adorned, and
   inflamed and drawn inwards. This inward urge of God gives and takes,
   makes rich and poor, brings weal and woe upon a man; it causes hope and
   despair; it burns and it freezes. But no tongue can tell of those gifts
   and works and contraries that here come to pass.

   This coming with its working is parted into four degrees, each one
   higher than the other, as we will show afterwards. And with it the
   lower part of man is adorned in the inward life.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VI

  OF THE SECOND COMING OF OUR LORD IN THE INWARD MAN

   The second way in which Christ comes inwardly, with a higher nobleness,
   more after His likeness, with increased gifts, and with a greater
   radiance, is a pouring forth of the riches of His Divine gifts into the
   higher powers of the soul, whereby the spirit is strengthened,
   enlightened, and enriched in many ways. This streaming of God into us
   demands of us a flowing out and a flowing back, with all these riches,
   into that same Source from which that torrent has flowed. And in this
   torrent God gives to us and shows to us great wonders; but He asks back
   from the soul all His gifts, increased beyond anything that any
   creature could accomplish. This exercise and this way is more noble and
   more like unto God than the first; and by it the three higher powers of
   the soul are adorned.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VII

  OF THE THIRD COMING OF OUR LORD

   The third way in which our Lord comes inwardly is by an inward stirring
   or touch in the unity of the spirit, wherein are the higher powers of
   the soul; wherefrom they flow forth, and to which they return again,
   and with which they always remain united in the bonds of love and
   through the natural unity of the spirit. In this coming consists the
   highest and most interior condition of the inward life; and by it the
   unity of the spirit is adorned in many ways.

   Now, in each coming, Christ desires of us a special going out of
   ourselves, toward a life that shall accord with the way of His coming.
   And therefore He says in ghostly wise within our hearts at each coming:
   Go ye out in your lives and in your practices in the way in which My
   graces and My gifts shall urge you. For according to the manner and way
   in which the Spirit of God urges, and drives, and draws, and streams
   into us, and stirs us; in this way we must go out and progress in our
   inward practices, if we are to become perfect. But if we withstand the
   Spirit of God by a life that does not accord with it, we lose that
   inward urge, and then the virtues will depart from us.

   These are the three comings of Christ, in inward exercises. We will now
   explain and set forth each coming separately. Attend therefore with
   diligence; for he who never has himself felt or experienced this he
   shall not easily understand it.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VIII

  HOW THE FIRST COMING HAS FOUR DEGREES

   The first coming of Christ in the exercise of desire is, as we have
   said, an inward and sensible thrust of the Holy Ghost, urging and
   driving us towards all virtues. This coming may be likened to the
   splendour and the power of the sun, which, from the moment when it
   rises, enlightens and brightens and warms the whole world. [43] So
   likewise Christ, the eternal Sun, beams and shines, dwelling above the
   summit of the spirit; and enlightens and enkindles the lowest part of
   man, namely, the fleshly heart and the sensible powers. And this
   happens in a moment of time, shorter than the twinkling of an eye; for
   God's work is swift. But that man in whom this should take place must
   be inwardly seeing, with the eyes of the understanding.

   In the higher lands, in the middle region of the world, the sun shines
   upon the mountains, bringing an early summer there, with good fruits
   and strong wine, and filling that land with joy. The same sun gives its
   splendour to the lower lands, at the utmost part of the earth. There
   the country is colder, and the power of the heat less; nevertheless,
   there too it produces many good fruits, though little wine. The men who
   dwell in the lower parts of themselves, in their outward senses, yet
   with a good intention, in moral virtues, in outward work, and in the
   grace of God: they too produce the good fruits of virtue, in great
   numbers and in many ways; but of the wine of inward joy and ghostly
   consolation they taste little.

   Now the man who wishes to feel within himself the glow of the Eternal
   Sun, which is Christ Himself, he should be seeing, and should dwell on
   the mountains in the higher lands, by a gathering together of all his
   powers, and lifting up his heart towards God, free and careless of joy
   and grief, and of all created things. There Christ, the Sun of
   righteousness, shines upon the free and uplifted heart: and these are
   the mountains that I mean.

   Christ, the glorious Sun, the Divine Brightness, by His inward coming
   and by the power of His Spirit, enlightens and brightens and enkindles
   the free heart and all the powers of the soul. And this is the first
   work of the inward coming in the exercise of desire. Like as the power
   and the nature of fire enkindles everything which is offered to the
   flames, so Christ, by the fiery ardour of His inward coming, enkindles
   every ready, free and uplifted heart; and in this coming He says: Go ye
   out by exercises according to the way of this coming.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [43] The source of this image seems to be a well-known passage in
   Dionysius the Areopagite-- "That brilliant likeness of the Divine
   Goodness, our great sun, all-radiant and ever-shining as a distant echo
   of the Good, enlightens all capable of receiving light . . . pouring
   upon the universe above and beneath the splendour of its rays. And if
   anything does not share in them this is not because of any lack in its
   distribution of light, but because of the inaptitude for light of those
   things which do not unfold themselves that they may participate in the
   light." (Divine Names, cap. 4.)
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER IX

  OF UNITY OF HEART

   Of this ardour there springs unity of heart; for we cannot achieve true
   unity unless the Spirit of God blows to a flame His fire in our hearts.
   For this fire makes one with itself and like to itself all that it can
   master and re-shape.

   Unity is this: that a man feel himself to be gathered together with all
   his powers in the unity of his heart. Unity brings inward peace and
   restfulness of heart. Unity of heart is a bond which draws together
   body and soul, heart and senses, and all the outward and inward powers
   and encloses them in the union of love.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER X

  OF INWARDNESS

   From this unity springs inwardness; for none can be inward save him who
   is gathered together in unity within himself. Inwardness means that a
   man is turned within, into his own heart, that thereby he may
   understand and feel the interior workings, and the interior words of
   God. Inwardness is a sensible fire of love, which the Spirit of God has
   blown to a flame, and which urges a man from within; and he knows not
   whence it comes nor what has befallen him.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XI

  OF SENSIBLE LOVE

   From inwardness there springs a sensible love, which fulfills the man's
   heart and the desirous power of the soul. This yearning love, and this
   sensible fruition of the heart, none can have save he who is inward of
   heart.

   Sensible love is a yearning and savouring delight which we feel in God
   as the eternal Good, wherein are all other goods. Sensible love
   forsakes all creatures as regards pleasure, not as regards need. Inward
   love feels itself moved from within by the Eternal Love; and this it
   must ever cherish. Inward love easily foregoes and despises all things
   that it may obtain that which it loves.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XII

  OF DEVOTION

   Of this sensible love is born devotion to God and to His glory. For
   none can have within his heart the hunger of devotion save him who
   bears within himself a sensible love of God. Where the fire of love
   sends up the flames of its desire to heaven, there is devotion.
   Devotion moves and draws a man, both from without and from within,
   towards the service of God. Devotion makes body and soul to blossom in
   nobility and worth before God and before all men. Devotion is demanded
   of us by God in every service which we ought to do to Him. Devotion
   purifies the body and the soul of everything that can stop and hinder
   us. Devotion shows and bestows the right way at blessedness.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XIII

  OF GRATITUDE

   Inward devotion often brings forth gratitude; for none can thank and
   praise God so well as the inward and devout man. And it is just that we
   should thank and praise God, because He has created us as reasonable
   creatures, and has ordained and destined heaven and earth and the
   angels to our service; and because He became man for our sins, and
   taught us, and lived for our sake, and showed us the way; and because
   He has ministered to us in humble raiment, and suffered an ignominous
   death for the love of us, and promised us His eternal kingdom and
   Himself also for our reward and for our wage. And He has spared us in
   our sins, and has forgiven us or will forgive us; and has poured His
   grace and His love into our souls, and will dwell and remain with us,
   and in us, throughout eternity. And He has visited us and will visit us
   all the days of our lives with His noble sacraments, according to the
   need of each, and has left us His Flesh and His Blood for food and
   drink, according to the desire and the hunger of each; and has set
   before us nature and the Scriptures and all creatures, as examples, and
   as a mirror, that therein we may look and learn how we may turn all our
   deeds to works of virtue; and has given us health and strength and
   power, and sometimes for our own good has sent us sickness; and in
   outward need has established inward peace and happiness in us; and has
   caused us to be called by Christian names and to have been born of
   Christian parents. For all these things we should thank God here on
   earth, that hereafter we may thank Him in eternity.

   We should also praise God by means of everything that we can offer to
   Him. To praise God, means that all his life long a man glorifies,
   reverences and venerates the Divine Omnipotence. The praise of God is
   the meet and proper work of the angels and the saints in heaven, and of
   loving men on earth. God should be praised by desire, by the lifting up
   of all our powers, by words, by works, with body and with soul, and
   faith whatsoever one possesses; in humble service, from without and
   from within. He who does not praise God while here on earth shall in
   eternity be dumb. To praise God is the dearest and most joyous work of
   every loving heart; and the heart which is full of praise desires that
   every creature should praise God. The praise of God has no end, for it
   is our bliss; and most justly shall we praise Him in eternity.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XIV

  OF TWO GRIEFS WHICH ARISE FROM INWARD GRATITUDE

   From inward gratitude and praise there arises a two fold grief of the
   heart and torment of desire. The first grief is, that we feel ourselves
   to lag behind in thanking, praising, glorifying and serving God. The
   second is, that we do not grow in charity, in virtue, in faith, and in
   perfect behaviour as much as we desire, that we may become worthy to
   thank and praise and serve God as it is proper to do. This is the
   second grief. These two are root and fruit, beginning and end, of all
   inward virtues.

   Inward grief and pain for our shortcomings in virtue and the praise of
   God, is the highest effect of this first degree of the inward exercise;
   and by it this degree is perfectly achieved.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XV

  A SIMILITUDE HOW WE SHOULD PERFORM THE FIRST DEGREE OF OUR INWARD EXERCISE

   Now consider in a similitude, how this inward exercise should be
   performed. When the natural fire has by its heat and power stirred
   water, or some other liquid, until it bubbles up; then this is its
   highest achievement. Then the water boils up and falls down to the
   bottom, and is then stirred again to the same activity by the power of
   the fire: so that the water is incessantly bubbling up, and the fire
   incessantly stirring it.

   And so likewise works the inward fire of the Holy Ghost. It stirs and
   goads and drives the heart and all the powers of the soul until they
   boil; that is, until they thank and praise God in the way of which I
   have told you. And then one falls down to that very ground, where the
   Spirit of God is burning. So that the fire of love ever burns, and the
   man's heart ever thanks and praises God with words and with works and
   yet always abides in lowliness; esteeming that which he should do and
   would do to be great, and that which he is able to do to be small.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XVI

  ANOTHER SIMILITUDE CONCERNING THE SAME EXERCISE

   When summer draws near and the sun rises higher, it draws the moisture
   out of the earth through the roots, and through the trunks of the
   trees, into the twigs; and hence come foliage, flower, and fruit.

   So likewise, when Christ the Eternal Sun rises and ascends in our
   hearts, so that it is summer in the adornment of our virtues, He gives
   His light and His heat to our desires, and draws the heart from all the
   multiplicity of earthly things, and brings about unity and inwardness;
   and makes the heart grow and bring forth the leaves of inward love, the
   flowers of ardent devotion, and the fruits of thanksgiving and praise,
   and makes these fruits to endure eternally, in humble grief, because of
   our shortcomings.

   Here ends the first of the four chief degrees of that inward working
   whereby the lowest part of man is adorned.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XVII

  OF THE SECOND DEGREE OF OUR INWARD EXERCISE, WHICH INCREASES INWARDNESS BY
  HUMILITY

   But, having likened the four degrees of the first coming of Christ to
   the splendour and the power of the sun, we also find in the sun another
   power and another action, which hastens the ripening, and increases the
   numbers, of the fruit.

   When the sun rises very high, and enters the sign of Gemini (that is,
   the Twins; or a twofold thing of one nature), which happens in the
   middle of the month of May: then it has a double power over flowers and
   herbs and everything that grows out of the earth. If, then, the planets
   which govern nature are well ordered according to the need of the
   season, the sun shines upon the earth and draws the moisture into the
   air. Thence come dew and rain; and the fruits increase and multiply.

   So likewise, when Christ that bright Sun has risen in our hearts above
   all things; when the demands of our bodily nature which are opposed to
   the spirit have been curbed and discreetly set in order; when we have
   achieved the virtues in the way of which you have heard in the first
   degree; when, lastly, through the ardour of our charity, all the
   pleasure, and all the peace, which we experience in these virtues, have
   been offered up and devoted to God, with thanksgiving and
   praise:--then, of all this there may come down a sweet rain of new
   inward consolation and the heavenly dew of the sweetness of God. This
   makes the virtues grow, and multiplies them twofold if we hinder it
   not. This is a new and special working, and a new coming, of Christ
   into the loving heart. And by it a man is lifted up into a higher state
   than that in which he was before. On this height Christ says: Go ye out
   according to the way of this coming.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XVIII

  OF THE PURE DELIGHT OF THE HEART AND THE SENSIBLE POWERS

   From this sweetness there springs a well-being of the heart and of all
   the bodily powers, so that a man thinks himself to be inwardly enfolded
   in the divine embrace of love. This delight and this consolation are
   greater and more pleasant to the soul and the body than all the
   satisfactions of the earth, even though one man should enjoy them all
   together. In this well-being God sinks into the heart by means of His
   gifts; with so much savoury solace and joy that the heart overflows
   from within. This makes a man comprehend the misery of those who live
   outside love. This well-being melts the heart to such a degree, that
   the man cannot contain himself through the fulness of inward joy.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XIX

  OF SPIRITUAL INEBRIATION

   From this rapturous delight [44] springs spiritual inebriation.
   Spiritual inebriation is this; that a man receives more sensible joy
   and sweetness than his heart can either contain or desire. Spiritual
   inebriation brings forth many strange gestures in men. It makes some
   sing and praise God because of their fulness of joy, and some weep with
   great tears because of their sweetness of heart. It makes one restless
   in all his limbs, so that he must run and jump and dance; and so
   excites another that he must gesticulate and clap his hands. Another
   cries out with a loud voice, and so shows forth the plenitude he feels
   within; another must be silent and melt away, because of the rapture
   which he feels in all his senses. At times he thinks that all the world
   must feel what he feels: at times he thinks that none can taste what he
   has attained. Often he thinks that he never could, nor ever shall, lose
   this well-being; at times he wonders why all men do not become
   God-desiring. At one time he thinks that God is for him alone, or for
   none other so much as for him; at another time he asks himself with
   amazement of what nature these delights can be, and whence they come,
   and what has happened to him. This is the most rapturous life (as
   regards our bodily feelings) which man may attain upon earth. Sometimes
   the excess of joy becomes so great that the man thinks that his heart
   must break. And for all these manifold gifts and miraculous works, he
   shall, with a humble heart, thank and praise and honour and reverence
   the Lord, Who can do all this; and thank Him with fervent devotion
   because it is His will to do all this. And the man shall always keep in
   his heart and speak through his mouth with sincere intention: "Lord, I
   am not worthy of this; yet I have need of Thy boundless goodness and of
   Thy support." In such humility he may grow and rise into higher
   virtues.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [44] The word "weelden," here translated "rapturous delight," really
   means a luxury of enjoyment: an overpassing and voluptuous rapture, in
   which the soul partakes of the rich content of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XX

  WHAT MAY HINDER A MAN IN THIS INEBRIATION

   When, however, this coming and this degree are granted to such men as
   first begin to turn from the world; even though their conversion be
   perfect, and they have abandoned all worldly consolation, that they may
   be wholly God's, and may live altogether for Him,--yet they are still
   feeble and have need of milk and sweet things, and not of the strong
   food of fierce temptation and the loss of God. And in this season, that
   is to say, in this state, hoar-frost and fog often harm such men; for
   it is just in the middle of May according to the course of the inward
   life. Hoar-frost is the desire to be somewhat or the belief that one is
   somewhat; or to be attached to one's self, or to suppose that we have
   earned these consolations and are worthy of them. This is hoar-frost,
   which may destroy the flowers and fruits of all the virtues. Fog is,
   the desire to rest in inward consolations and sweetness. This darkens
   the air of the reason; and the powers, which ought to open and flower,
   close again. And thereby one loses the knowledge of truth, and yet may
   keep a certain false sweetness, which is given by the devil, and which
   in the end shall lead us astray.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXI

  A SIMILITUDE HOW A MAN SHOULD ACT AND BEAR HIMSELF IN THIS CASE

   Now I will give you a short similitude, that you may not err in this
   case, but may govern yourselves prudently. You should watch the wise
   bee and do as it does. It dwells in unity, in the congregation of its
   fellows, and goes forth, not in the storm, but in calm and still
   weather, in the sunshine, towards all those flowers in which sweetness
   may be found. It does not rest on any flower, neither on any beauty nor
   on any sweetness; but it draws from them honey and wax, that is to say,
   sweetness and light-giving matter, and brings both to the unity of the
   hive, that therewith it may produce fruits, and be greatly profitable.
   Christ, the Eternal Sun, shining into the open heart, causes that heart
   to grow and to bloom, and it overflows with all the inward powers with
   joy and sweetness.

   So the wise man will do like the bee, and he will fly forth with
   attention and with reason and with discretion, towards all those gifts
   and towards all that sweetness which he has ever experienced, and
   towards all the good which God has ever done to him. And in the light
   of love and with inward observation, he will taste of the multitude of
   consolations and good things; and will not rest upon any flower of the
   gifts of God, but, laden with gratitude and praise, will fly back into
   the unity, wherein he wishes to rest and to dwell eternally with God.

   This is the second degree of that inward working which adorns the lower
   part of man in many ways.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXII

  OF THE THIRD DEGREE OF THE SPIRITUAL COMING OF CHRIST

   When the sun has risen in the heavens as high as it can, it stands in
   the sign of Cancer (which means Crab, because it cannot go further, but
   begins to go back). Then come the fiercest heats of the whole year. And
   the sun draws up all the moisture, and the earth becomes dry, and the
   fruits ripen quickly.

   So likewise, when Christ, the Divine Sun, has risen to the zenith of
   our hearts--that is, above all the gifts and consolations and sweetness
   which we may receive from Him--so that we do not rest in any savours,
   how great soever they be, which God may pour into our souls; if then,
   masters of ourselves, we ever turn inwards, by the way which has been
   shown heretofore, with humble praise and with fervent thanksgiving,
   towards the very source from which all gifts flow forth according to
   the needs and the merits of each creature: then Christ stands on high
   in the zenith of our hearts, and He will draw all things, that is, all
   our powers, to Himself. When thus neither savour nor consolation can
   overcome or hinder the loving heart, but it would rather forgo all
   consolations and all gifts, that it may find Him Whom it loves: then
   there arises from this the third kind of inward exercise, by which man
   is uplifted and adorned in his sensibility and the lower part of his
   being.

   The first work of Christ, and the beginning of this degree consists in
   this: that God draws the heart, the desires, and all the powers of the
   soul up towards heaven, and calls them to be united with Him, and says
   in ghostly wise within the heart: Go ye out of yourselves by the way in
   which I draw and invite you. This drawing and this inviting I cannot
   well make plain to gross and insensitive men; but it is an inward
   constraining and drawing of the heart towards the most high unity of
   God. This inward summons is joyful to the loving heart above anything
   it ever experienced before. For hence arise a new way and a higher
   exercise.

   Here the heart opens itself in joy and in desire, and all the veins
   gape, and all the powers of the soul are in readiness, and desire to
   fulfil that which is demanded of them by God and by His unity. This
   invitation is a shining forth of Christ, the Eternal Sun; and it brings
   forth such great pleasure and joy in the heart, and makes the heart
   open so widely, that it can never wholly close again. And thereby a man
   is wounded in the heart from within, and feels the wound of love. To be
   wounded by love is the sweetest feeling and the sharpest pain which any
   one may endure. To be wounded by love is to know for certain that one
   shall be healed; for the ghostly wound brings woes and weal at the same
   time. For Christ, the true Sun streams and shines into the wounded and
   open heart and calls it to oneness again. And this renews the wound and
   all its pangs. [45]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [45] The "wound of love" as a metaphor for the rapturous yet piercing
   entrance of Divine Love into the heart, meets us again and again in the
   literature of mysticism. "God," says St Basil, "is the Perfect Beauty
   which inflicts on the soul an ineffable wound of love." In many cases,
   as for instance in the celebrated "transverberation" of St Teresa, this
   image probably describes one of those psycho-physical parallelisms--not
   uncommon in the records of high religious experience--in which actual
   bodily pangs accompany the spiritual crisis. Thus Richard Rolle says,
   "O thou everlasting fairness, thou hast wounded my heart; scarcely I
   live for joy and almost I die, for I may not in my deadly flesh suffer
   such a sweetness of this great majesty." (The Mending of Life, cap.
   11.) Thus, too, St John of the Cross-- "O burn that burns to heal! O
   more than pleasant wound! And O soft hand, O touch most delicate That
   dost new life reveal, That dost in grace abound, And, slaying, dost
   from death to life translate." (Llama de Amor Viva. Trans. by Arthur
   Symons.)
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXIII

  OF THE PAIN AND RESTLESSNESS OF LOVE

   Of this inward demand and this invitation, and also because the
   creature lifts itself up and offers itself, and all that it can do, and
   yet can neither attain nor acquire the unity--of these things spring a
   ghostly pain. When the inmost part of the heart and the source of life
   have been wounded by love, and one cannot obtain that which one desires
   above all things, but must ever abide where one does not wish to be:
   from these two things pain comes forth. Here Christ is risen to the
   zenith of the conscience, and He sends His Divine rays into the hungry
   desires and into the longings of the heart; and this splendour burns
   and dries up and consumes all the moisture, that is, the strength and
   the powers of nature. The desire of the open heart, and the shining of
   the Divine rays, cause a perpetual pain.

   If, then, one cannot achieve God and yet cannot and will not do without
   Him, from these two things there arise in such men tumult and
   restlessness, both without and within. And so long as a man is thus
   agitated, no creature, neither in heaven nor on earth, can give him
   rest or help him. In this state there are sometimes spoken from within
   sublime and salutary words, and singular teachings and wisdom are
   given. In this inward tumult one is ready to suffer all that can be
   suffered, that one may obtain that which one loves. This fury of love
   is an inward impatience which will hardly use reason or follow it, if
   it cannot obtain that which it loves. This inward fury eats a man's
   heart and drinks his blood. Here the sensible heat of love is fiercer
   than at any other stage in man's whole life; and his bodily nature is
   secretly wounded and consumed without any outward work, and the fruits
   of the virtues ripen more quickly than in all the degrees which have
   been shown heretofore.

   In the like season of the year, the visible sun enters the sign of Leo,
   that is, the Lion, who is fierce by nature, for he is the lord over all
   beasts. So likewise, when a man comes to this way, Christ, the bright
   Sun, stands in the sign of the Lion, for the rays of His heat are so
   fierce that the blood in the heart of the impatient man must boil. And
   when this fierce way prevails, it masters and subdues all other ways
   and works; for it wills to be wayless, that is, without manner. And in
   this tumult a man sometimes falls into a desire and restless longing to
   be freed from the prison of his body, so that he may at once be united
   with Him Whom he loves. And he opens his inward eyes and beholds the
   heavenly house full of glory and joy, and his Beloved crowned in the
   midst of it, flowing forth towards His saints in abounding bliss;
   whilst he must lack all this. And therefrom there often spring in such
   a man outward tears and great longings. He looks down and considers the
   place of exile in which he has been imprisoned, and from which he
   cannot escape; then tears of sadness and misery gush forth. These
   natural tears soothe and refresh the man's heart, and they are
   wholesome to the bodily nature, preserving its strength and powers and
   sustaining him through this state of tumult. All the manifold
   considerations and exercises according to ways or manner are helpful to
   the impatient man; that his strength may be preserved and that he may
   long endure in virtue.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXIV

  OF ECSTACIES AND DIVINE REVELATIONS

   By this fierce ardour and this impatience some men are at times caught
   into the spirit, above the senses; and there words are spoken to them
   and images and similitudes shown to them, teaching them some truth of
   which they or other men have need, or else things that are to come.
   These are called revelations or visions. If they are bodily images,
   they are received in the imagination. This may be the work of an angel
   in man, through the power of God. If it be an intellectual truth, or a
   ghostly image, through which God reveals Himself in His
   unfathomableness, this is received in the understanding; and the man
   can clothe it in words in so far as it can be expressed in words.
   Sometimes a man may also be drawn above himself and above the spirit
   (but not altogether outside himself) into an Incomprehensible Good,
   which he shall never be able either to utter or to explain in the way
   in which he heard and saw; for in this simple act and this simple
   vision, to hear and to see are one. And none can work this in man,
   without intermediary and without the co-operation of any creature, save
   God alone. It is called Raptus; which means, rapt away, or uplifted, or
   carried away. At times God grants to such men a sudden spiritual
   glimpse, like the lightning in the sky. It comes like a sudden glimpse
   of strange brightness, shining forth from the Simple Nudity. And
   thereby for an instant the spirit is raised above itself; but the light
   passes at once and the man returns to himself again. This is the work
   of God Himself; it is something very sublime; for those to whom it
   happens often become illuminated men.

   Other things sometimes happen to those who live in the fierce ardour of
   love; for often another light shines into them, and this is the work of
   God through means. In this light the heart and the desirous powers
   uplift themselves towards that light; and, in the meeting with that
   light, the joy and the satisfaction are so great that the heart cannot
   contain them, but breaks out in a loud voice with cries of joy. And
   this is called the Jubilus, or jubilation; that is, a joy which cannot
   be uttered in words. [46] And one cannot contain oneself; but if one
   would go out with an opened and uplifted heart to meet this light the
   voice must follow, so long as this exercise and this light endure. Some
   inward men are at times taught in a dream by their guardian angels or
   by other angels, concerning many things of which they have need. Some
   men too are found who have many sudden intuitions, or inspirations, or
   imaginations, and also have miraculous dreams, and yet remain in their
   outward senses. But these know nothing of the tumult of love; for they
   dwell in outward multiplicity, and love has not wounded them. These
   things may be natural, or they may come from the devil, or from good
   angels, and therefore we may have faith in them so far as they accord
   with Holy Writ, and with the truth, but no more. If we trust them
   beyond this, we may easily be deceived. [47]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [46] The Jubilus, or inarticulate song of joy, was recognised by
   medieval writers as a normal form of religious exaltation: there are
   many references to it in mystical literature. Thus Jacopone da Tod" in
   the poem, "O jubilo del core"-- "The Jubilus in fire awakes And
   straight the man must sing and pray, His tongue in childish stammering
   shakes, Nor knows he what his lips may say; He cannot quench nor hide
   away That sweetness pure and infinite. "The Jubilus in flame is lit And
   straight the man must shout and sing; So close to love his heart is
   knit He scarce can bear the honeyed sting; His clamour and his cries
   must ring And shame for ever take its flight." (Laude 76. Trans. by J.
   Beck.)

   [47] This is the traditional Christian test for all visions and
   revelations. Thus Richard of St. Victor, the source of so much of
   Ruysbroeck's teaching, says in a celebrated passage-- "Even though you
   believe that you have been taken up into the high mountain apart, even
   though you believe that you see Christ transfigured, be not too ready
   to believe anything you see in Him or hear from him, unless Moses and
   Elias run to meet Him. I hold all truth in suspicion which Scripture
   does not confirm: nor do I receive Christ in His glory unless Moses and
   Elias are talking with Him." (Benjamin Minor, cap. 81.)
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXV

  AN EXAMPLE SHOWING HOW ONE IS HINDERED IN THIS EXERCISE

   Now I will show you the hindrances and the dangers which he meets with
   who dwells in the fury of love. In this time, as you have heard, the
   sun is in the sign of the Lion; and this is the most unhealthy period
   of the year, although it is fruitful; for here begin the dog-days,
   which bring many a plague with them. Then the weather may become so
   unwholesome and so hot that in some countries herbs and trees wither
   and shrivel, and in some waters the fishes pine away and perish, and on
   the land men also sicken and die. And this is not caused only by the
   sun, for then it would be the same everywhere; in all countries and in
   all waters, and with all men. But the cause of it is often the
   corruption and the disorder of the matter on which the sun's power
   works. So likewise it is when a man comes into this state of
   impatience. He enters in truth into the dog-days, and the splendour of
   the Divine rays burns so fiercely and so hotly from above, and the
   heart wounded by love is so inflamed from within--since the ardour of
   affection and the impatience of desire have been thus enkindled--that
   the man falls into impatience and striving, even as a woman who labours
   in child-birth and cannot be delivered. If the man then look
   steadfastly into his own wounded heart, and at Him Whom he loves, these
   woes grow without ceasing. So greatly does the torment increase that
   the man withers and shrivels in his bodily nature, even as the trees in
   hot countries; and he dies in the fury of love, and enters the kingdom
   of heaven without passing through purgatory. But though he dies well
   who dies of love, as long as a tree may bear good fruit, it should
   neither be felled nor uprooted. Sometimes God flows forth with great
   sweetness into the turbulent heart. Then the heart swims in bliss, as a
   fish in water; and the inmost ground of the heart burns in the fury of
   love, even whilst it swims in delight in the gifts of God, because of
   the blissful and impatient ardour of the loving heart itself. And to
   dwell long in this degree consumes the bodily nature. All men who burn
   in the fury of love must pine away in that state; but those who can
   govern themselves well do not die. [48]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [48] Rolle's Fire of Love provides an apt commentary upon this chapter.
   Thus he says of the devout and ardent lover who "burns in the fire of
   the Holy Ghost"-- "He utterly burns and longs for light while he thus
   fervently tastes of things heavenly . . . as the seraphim, to whom he
   is like in loving mind, he cries and says to his noble Lover, Behold,
   loving I burn, greedily desiring.' Thus with fire untrowed and thirling
   flame the soul of a lover is burned. It gladdens all things and
   heavenlike sparkles: nor happily do I long to make an end, but, always
   going to that which I love, death to me is sweet and sicker."
   (Incendium Amoris, I., cap. 14.)
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXVI

  ANOTHER EXAMPLE

   And now I will warn you against another thing which may cause great
   harm. Sometimes in that hot season there falls the honey-dew of a
   certain false sweetness, which pollutes the fruit, or utterly spoils
   it. And it is most apt to fall at noon, in bright sunshine, and in big
   drops; and it is hardly to be distinguished from rain. So likewise,
   some men may be robbed of their outward senses by a certain light
   produced by the devil. And in this light they are enwrapped and
   ensnared, and at the same time many kinds of images, both false and
   true, are shown to them, and they are spoken to in diverse ways; and
   all this is seen and received of them with great delight. And here
   there fall sometimes the honey-drops of a false sweetness, in which a
   man may find his pleasure. He who esteems it much receives much of it:
   and thereby the man is easily polluted, for if he will hold for true
   those things which are not like to truth, for the reason that they have
   been shown or spoken to him, he falls into error and the fruit of
   virtue is lost. But those who have trodden the ways whereof I have
   written before, though they may be tempted by this spirit and this
   light, they will recognise them and will not be harmed.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXVII

  A PARABLE OF THE ANT

   A brief parable I will give to those who dwell in the tumult of love,
   that they may endure this state nobly and becomingly, and may attain to
   higher virtues. There is a small insect called the ant. It is strong
   and sagacious, and very loth to die. It lives by choice amongst the
   congregation of its fellows, in hot and dry soil. The ant works during
   summer, and gathers grain for food for the winter. And it splits the
   grain in two lest it should sprout and be spoiled, and be of no use
   when nothing can be gathered anymore. And it seeks no strange ways, but
   always goes forth by the same way. And if it abides its time, it shall
   be able to fly.

   Thus should these men do. They should be strong in abiding the coming
   of Christ, sagacious against the communications and inspirations of the
   devil. They should not desire death; but God's glory alone, and for
   themselves new virtues. They should dwell in the congregation of their
   heart and of their powers, and should follow the drawing and the
   inviting of the Divine Unity. They should dwell in warm and dry soil,
   that is, in the fierce tumult of love and in a great restlessness. And
   they should labour during the summer of this life, and gather the
   fruits of virtue for eternity; and they should split these fruits in
   two. The one part is, that they should ever desire the most high
   fruition of Eternity; and the other part is that, by means of the
   reason, they should always restrain themselves as much as they can, and
   abide the time which God has ordained to them, and thus the fruit of
   virtue is preserved unto eternity. And they should not follow strange
   paths or singular ways; but they should follow the track of love
   through all storms to that place whither love shall lead them. And if
   they abide the time, and persevere in all virtues, they shall behold
   the Mystery of God and take flight towards It.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXVIII

  OF THE FOURTH DEGREE OF THE COMING OF CHRIST

   Now we will speak further of the fourth manner of the coming of Christ,
   uplifting and perfecting a man by inward exercise in the lower part of
   his being. But having likened all the inward comings to the splendour
   of the sun, and to its power, according to the course of the year, we
   will speak further, according to the course of the seasons, of another
   action and another work of the sun.

   When the sun first begins to descend from the zenith to the nadir, it
   enters the sign which is called Virgo, that is, the Virgin, because now
   the season becomes unfruitful, as a virgin is. (In this time the
   glorious Virgin Mary, the mother of Christ, ascended to heaven full of
   joy and rich in all virtues.) At this time the heat begins to grow
   less; and men begin to gather in, for use during the rest of the year,
   those ripe and lasting fruits which can be kept and consumed long
   afterwards, such as corn and wine and the durable fruits, which have
   now come to their maturity. And a part of the same corn is sown, so
   that it be multiplied for the benefit of men. In this season all the
   work of the sun of the whole year is perfected and fulfilled.

   So likewise, when Christ the glorious Sun has risen to the zenith in a
   man's heart, as I have taught you in the third degree; and when He then
   begins to descend and to hide the shining of His Divine rays and to
   forsake the man; then the heat and impatience of love begin to grow
   less. Now when Christ thus hides Himself, and withdraws the shining of
   His brightness and His heat, this is the first work, and the new
   coming, of this degree. Then Christ speaks in ghostly wise within this
   man, saying: "Go ye out in such wise as I will now show you." So the
   man goes out, and finds himself poor and miserable and forsaken. Here
   all the tempest and fury and impatience of love grow less, and the hot
   summer passes into autumn, and all its riches are turned to great
   poverty. Then the man begins to complain because of his wretchedness:
   Whither has gone the ardent love, the inwardness, the gratitude, the
   joyful praise? And the inward consolation, the intimate joy, the
   sensible savour, how has he lost them? How have the fierce tempest of
   love, and all the other gifts which he felt before, become dead in him?
   And he feels like an ignorant man who has lost all his pains and his
   labour. And often his natural life is troubled by such a loss.

   Sometimes these unhappy men are also deprived of their earthly goods,
   of friends, of kinsmen; and they are abandoned of all creatures, their
   holiness is not known or esteemed, men speak evil of their works and
   their whole lives, and they are despised and rejected by all their
   neighbours. And at times they fall into sickness and many a plague, and
   some into bodily temptations; or, that which is worst of all, into
   temptations of the spirit.

   From this poverty arise a fear lest one should fall, and a kind of
   half-doubt. This is the utmost point at which a man can hold his ground
   without falling into despair. Such a man likes to seek out good men,
   and to complain to them, and show them his miseries; and he desires the
   help and prayers of Holy Church and of all the just.

CHAPTER XXIX

  SHOWING WHAT THE FORSAKEN MAN SHOULD DO

   Here the man should bethink himself with a humble heart that of his own
   he has nothing but misery; and he should say in resignation and
   self-abandonment the words which were spoken by the holy man Job: "The
   Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; as it pleased the Lord, so it
   hath been done; blessed be the name of the Lord. And he should renounce
   himself in all things, and should say and mean in his heart, "Lord, I
   am as willing to be poor in all those things of which I have been
   deprived as I am ready to be rich, O Lord, if it be Thy will and to Thy
   glory; not my will according to nature, O Lord, but Thy will and my
   will according to spirit be done. For I am Thine own, O Lord, and would
   as well be in hell as in heaven, if it were to Thy glory. Lord, do unto
   me according to Thy good pleasure." Of all this suffering and
   abandonment the man should make an inward joy; and he should give
   himself into the hands of God, and should be glad because he is able to
   suffer for the glory of God. And if he be true to this disposition, he
   shall taste such an inward joy as he never tasted before; for nothing
   is more joyful to the lover of God, than to feel that he belongs wholly
   to his Beloved. And if he has indeed followed the way of the virtues
   straight to this degree, even though he has not passed through all the
   states which have been pointed out heretofore, it is not needful, if he
   feels within himself the source of the virtues: which is in activity,
   humble obedience; and, in passivity, patient resignation. In these two
   things this degree is established in everlasting surety.

   In this season of the year the sun of heaven enters the sign of Libra,
   which means the Scales; for day and night are evenly balanced, and the
   sun divides the light from the darkness in equal parts. So likewise
   Christ stands in the sign of the Balance for the resigned man. Whether
   He gives sweetness or bitterness, darkness or light, whatever he lays
   upon the scale, the man balances it evenly; all things are equal to
   him, save sin alone, which is for ever cast out. When such utterly
   resigned men have thus been deprived of all consolation, and believe
   that they have lost all virtues, and are forsaken of God and of all
   creatures: then if they are able to reap them, all kinds of fruit, the
   corn and vine, are ready and ripe. And this image means, that all that
   the body can endure, whatsoever it be, should be offered up to God
   gladly, and of one's own free will, and without resistance to the
   supreme Will. All the outward and inward virtues, which a man practised
   with joy in the fire of love; these, since he knows them and is able to
   perform them, he should now practise diligently and with courage, and
   should offer them up to God. Never were they so dear to God; for never
   were they so noble and so fair. All the consolations which God ever
   gave should gladly be given up, if it be to His glory. This is the
   harvest of the corn, and of all kinds of ripe fruits, on which we shall
   live eternally, and which make us rich in God. Thus the virtues are
   made perfect, and sorrow is turned to eternal wine. By such men, and by
   their lives and their patience, all those who know them and all their
   neighbours are taught and changed for the better: and so the corn of
   their virtues is sown and multiplied for the benefit of all good men.

   This is the fourth way in which a man by inward working is adorned and
   perfected in the bodily powers and the lower part of himself: and in no
   other way can he continually grow and become more perfect. But as such
   men have been harshly afflicted, and have been tried, and tempted, and
   combatted, by God, by their own selves, and by all creatures, in them
   the virtue of resignation reaches a singular perfection. Nevertheless,
   resignation, or the renunciation of self-will for the will of God, is
   before all things needful for all men who wish to be saved.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXX

  A PARABLE: HOW ONE MAY BE HINDERED IN THIS FOURTH DEGREE

   At this season of the year, so soon as the equinox is come, the sun
   begins to descend and the weather becomes cooler. And then some
   imprudent men become full of noxious humours, which enter into the
   stomach, and spoil the health and bring many diseases: and these
   destroy the appetite and the taste of good food, and bring many to
   death. And some men are corrupted by these noxious humours, so that
   they get dropsy, and have therefrom long torments and sometimes die.
   And from the super-abundance of these humours come sickness and fever
   from which many men suffer, and of which some die. And so likewise it
   is, when men of good-will, who once tasted God, have swerved from Him
   and from truth, and have gone astray; these either sicken in the way of
   perfection, or wither away as regards virtue, or fall into eternal
   death, through one of these maladies, and some through all three.
   Especially when he is forsaken a man has need of much strength, and
   must exercise himself in the way I have just taught you: thus he shall
   not be deceived. But the unwise man, who rules himself ill, falls
   easily into these maladies; for in him the weather has grown cooler.
   For this reason his nature becomes slow in virtue and in good works,
   and craves for comfort and softness of the body; often without
   discretion and more than is needful. And other men would like well to
   receive solace from God, if they might partake of Him without pains and
   labour. And some seek for solace in creatures, wherefrom great harm
   often ensues. And some think themselves sick and feeble and that their
   powers are exhausted, and believe that they have need of all that they
   can get, and that they must cherish their bodies in comfort and repose.
   When a man yields himself in such a way, and seeks without discretion
   after bodily things and comforts; then all such things are noxious
   humours which fulfil the stomach, that is to say, the man's heart, and
   take from him the taste and the enjoyment of good food, that is to say,
   of all the virtues.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXXI

  OF ANOTHER HINDRANCE

   If a man thus falls into sickness and cold, he is sometimes caught by
   dropsy, that is to say, he has an inclination towards the outward
   possession of earthly things. The more such men acquire, the more they
   desire; for they straightway become dropsical. The belly, that is, the
   appetites or lusts, swells terribly, and the thirst will not be
   quenched. But the face of conscience and discretion becomes small and
   thin, for these men put hindrances against the inflow of the grace of
   God. If they thus accumulate the waters of earthly possessions about
   the heart, that is, if they cling to them with desire, they cannot
   progress in works of charity; for they are sick, they lack the inward
   spirit of life and breath, that is to say, they lack the grace of God
   and inward charity. And therefore they cannot rid themselves of the
   waters of earthly riches: the heart is submerged in them, and they are
   often choked therein and die an eternal death. But those who keep the
   waters of earthly riches far below the heart, so that they are master
   of their possessions and can renounce them whenever it is needful:
   these, though they may suffer long from inordinate inclinations, may
   yet be cured.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXXII

  OF FOUR KINDS OF FEVER WHEREWITH A MAN MAY BE TORMENTED

   Those men who are full of noxious humours, that is to say, full of
   inordinate inclination towards bodily comfort and towards foreign and
   creaturely consolations, can fall into four kinds of fever.

   The first kind is called the quotidian fever. It is a multiplicity of
   the heart; for these men wish to know all things, and to speak of all
   things, and to criticise and to judge all things, and meanwhile they
   often fail to observe themselves. They are weighed down by many strange
   cares; they must often hear what they do not like; and the least thing
   troubles them. Their thoughts are restless; first this, then that,
   first here, then there; they are like to the winds. This is a daily
   fever; for they are troubled, and busied, and in multiplicity, from
   morning until evening, and sometimes in the night also, whether they
   sleep or wake. Though this may exist in a state of grace and without
   mortal sin, yet it hinders inwardness and inward practices and takes
   away the taste of God and of all virtues. And this is an eternal loss.

   The second kind of fever comes on alternate days. It is called
   fickleness. If it lasts long it is often dangerous. This fever is of
   two kinds: sometimes it comes from intemperate heat, and sometimes from
   cold. The one which comes from intemperate heat befalls certain good
   men; for when they are, or have been, touched by God, and then are
   forsaken of Him, they sometimes fall into fickleness. To-day they
   choose one way of life, and to-morrow another; at one time they wish to
   be silent, and another time they wish continually to speak. First they
   wish to enter into this order, then into that. First they wish to give
   all their goods to God, then they wish to keep them. At one time they
   wish to wander abroad, at another to be enclosed in a cell. At one time
   they long to go often to the Sacrament, and shortly afterwards they
   value this but little. At one time they wish to pray much in a loud
   voice, and another time but shortly after, they would keep silence. And
   this is both a vain curiosity and a fickleness, which hinder and impede
   a man from comprehending inward truth, and destroy in him both the
   source and the practice of all inwardness. Now mark whence this
   unstable condition comes in some good men. When a man sets his thoughts
   and his inward active endeavour on the virtues and on outward behaviour
   more than on God and on union with God: though he remains in the grace
   of God (for in the virtues he aims at God), yet none the less his life
   is unstable, for he does not feel himself to rest in God above all
   virtues. And therefore he possesses something that he does not know;
   for, Him Whom he seeks in the virtues and in the multiplicity of acts,
   he possesses within himself, above intention, above virtues, and above
   all ways and means. And therefore, if this man would overcome his
   fickleness, he must learn to rest above all virtues in God and in the
   most high Unity of God.

   The other fever of fickleness, which comes from cold, all those men
   have who love God indeed, but at the same time seek and inordinately
   love some other thing. This fever comes from cold, for the heat of
   charity is poor indeed where not God alone, but foreign things besides
   and with God, urge and excite us towards the works of virtue. Such men
   are fickle of heart; for in all the things which they do, nature is
   secretly seeking its own, often without their knowledge, for they know
   not themselves. Such men choose and abandon, first one way of life,
   then another. To-day they choose one priest, to whom they would go for
   confession and for counsel their whole life long; and to-morrow they
   will choose another. On all things they will ask advice, but hardly
   ever do they act upon it. All things for which they are blamed and
   rebuked they like to excuse and to justify. Of fine words they have
   plenty, but little is in them. They like well to have a reputation for
   virtue, but without great effort. They wish their virtues to be known,
   and these are therefore empty, and have no savour either of God nor of
   themselves. Others they teach, but will themselves hardly be taught or
   reproved. A natural self-love and a hidden pride make them thus fickle.
   Such people walk on the verge of hell: one false step, and into it they
   fall.

   In some men this fever of fickleness may produce the quartan fever;
   that is, an estrangement from God and from themselves and from truth
   and from all virtues. And then they fall into such confusion that they
   are at their wit's end and know not what to do. This illness is more
   dangerous than either of the others.

   Through this estrangement a man sometimes falls into a fever which is
   called the double quartan, which means indifference. Then the fourth
   day is doubled, and he can hardly recover, for he becomes indifferent
   and heedless of all that is needful to eternal life. So he may fall
   into sin, like one who never knew anything of God. If this may befall
   those men who govern themselves ill in this state of abandonment, then
   it behoves those to beware who never knew ought of God, nor of the
   inward life, nor of that sweet savour which good men find in their
   exercises.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXXIII

  SHOWING HOW THESE FOUR DEGREES IN THEIR PERFECTION ARE FOUND IN CHRIST

   If we wish to progress rightly in the four aforesaid degrees of the
   inward exercise which adorn a man's bodily powers and the lower part of
   his nature, we should mark Christ, Who taught us these four ways and
   has gone before us therein. Christ, the bright Sun, rose in the heavens
   of the most high Trinity, and in the dawn of His glorious mother, the
   Virgin Mary; who was, and is, the dawn and daybreak of all those graces
   in which we shall rejoice eternally.

   Now mark this: Christ had, and still has, the first degree; for he was
   one and in oneness. In Him were, and are, gathered and united all the
   virtues that ever were, and ever shall be, practised; moreover all the
   creatures who ever practised, and ever shall practise, these virtues.
   Thus He was the Father's Only Begotten Son, and was united with human
   nature. And He was inward; for He brought to earth the fire that
   inflamed all the saints and all good men. And He yielded a sensible
   love and loyalty to His Father, and to all those who shall enjoy Him in
   eternity. And His devotion and His loving and aspiring heart burned and
   groaned before His Father because of the miseries of all men. His whole
   life, and all His works, from without and from within, and all His
   words, were thanksgiving and praise, and glorifying of His Father. This
   is the first degree.

   Christ, the Sun of Love, sparkled and shone brighter still, and more
   ardently; for in Him was, and is, the fulness of all graces and gifts.
   And for this reason the heart of Christ and His way of life, and His
   conduct, and His service, over-flowed in mercy, in gentleness, in
   humility, and in generosity; and He was so gracious and so lovable that
   His ways and His person drew all men of goodwill. He was the unspotted
   lily amidst the flowers of the field, wherefrom all the just may suck
   the honey of eternal sweetness and eternal consolation. For all the
   gifts which were ever bestowed upon the manhood of Christ, Christ
   thanked and praised, according to His manhood, His Eternal Father, Who
   is the Father of all gifts; and He rested, as regards the highest
   powers of His soul, above all gifts, in the most high Unity of God,
   from which all gifts flow forth. Thus He possessed the second degree.

   Christ the glorious Sun sparkled and shone higher still, and brighter,
   and more ardently; for all the days of His life long His bodily powers
   and His senses, His heart and His mind, were called and destined of His
   Father to that most high glory and beatitude which He now enjoys,
   according to His senses and His bodily powers. And He Himself was both
   naturally and supernaturally inclined thereto, according to His
   affections; nevertheless He was willing to abide in this exile until
   the time that His Father had foreseen and ordained from eternity. Thus
   He possessed the third degree.

   When the due time had come wherein Christ should reap, and carry into
   the Eternal Kingdom, the fruits of all those virtues which ever had
   ripened, or ever should ripen, then the Eternal Sun began to descend;
   for then Christ humbled Himself, and delivered His bodily life into the
   hands of His enemies. And in this distress He was denied and forsaken
   of His friends, and from His human nature there was withdrawn all
   inward and outward consolation; and there was laid on it misery and
   sorrow, buffettings, blasphemies, and heavy burdens, and it paid the
   price of all our sins according to justice. And He bore these things in
   humble patience, and, whilst He was thus forsaken, He wrought the
   greatest work of love. And, thereby He has bought back and redeemed our
   eternal heritage. Thus is He adorned in the lower part of His noble
   manhood; for in it He suffered these pains for our sins. And this is
   why He is called the Saviour of the world, and why He is glorified,
   honoured, and exalted, and set on the right hand of His Father, where
   He reigns in mightiness; and all creatures, in heaven, and on earth,
   and in hell, bow the knee eternally before His most high Name.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXXIV

  SHOWING HOW A MAN SHOULD LIVE IF HE WOULD BE ENLIGHTENED

   The man who lives in true obedience and in the moral virtues, according
   to the commandments of God, and besides this practices the inward
   virtues according to the teaching and stirring of the Holy Ghost, who
   is just in deed and in word, who seeks not his own, neither in time nor
   in eternity, who can bear with equanimity and with true patience,
   darkness and heaviness, and all kinds of miseries, and thanks God for
   everything, and offers himself up with humble resignation: he has
   received the first coming of Christ according to the way of inward
   exercise. And he has gone out from himself in the inward life, and has
   adorned with rich virtues and gifts his quickened heart and the unity
   of his body and senses. When such a man has been altogether purified
   and set at rest, and is gathered together into unity as regards his
   lower powers, he can be inwardly enlightened, if God deems that the
   time is fit and he craves it. It may also come to pass, that a man may
   be enlightened at the beginning of his conversion, if he yield himself
   wholly to the will of God and renounce all selfhood; all lies in this.
   Such a man, however, must afterwards pass through those degrees and
   ways of the outward and the inward life which have been shown
   heretofore; but this would be easier to him than to another, who mounts
   from below upwards, for he has more light than the other man.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXXV

  OF THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST, OR, THE FOUNTAIN WITH THREE RILLS

   Now we will speak further of the second manner of the coming of Christ,
   in those inward exercises by which a man is adorned, enlightened, and
   enriched in the three highest powers of the soul. This coming we will
   liken to a living fountain with three rills. [49]

   The fountain-head, from which the rills flow forth, is the fulness of
   Divine grace within the unity of our spirit. There grace dwells
   essentially; abiding as a brimming fountain, and actively flowing forth
   in rills into all the powers of the soul, each according to its need.
   These rills are special inflowings or workings of God in the higher
   powers, wherein God works by means of grace in many diverse ways.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [49] Probably Ruysbroeck had here in mind such a "fountain" or lavabo
   as was to be seen in almost any fourteenth century cloister: a cistern
   or basin fed by a duct of running water, and pouring itself out in
   several streams into the lower basin or trough which provided
   washing-places for the brethren.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXXVI

  THE FIRST RILL ADORNS THE MEMORY [50]

   The first rill of grace, which God causes to flow forth in this coming,
   is a pure simplicity, shining in the spirit without differentiation.
   This rill takes its rise from the fountain within the unity of the
   spirit; and it flows straight downwards and pours through all the
   powers of the soul, the lower and the higher; and raises them above all
   multiplicity and all busyness and produces simplicity in a man; and
   shows and gives him the inward bond of unity of spirit. Thus he is
   lifted up as regards his memory, and is freed from distracting images
   and from fickleness.

   Now in this light, Christ demands a going out in conformity with this
   light and with this coming. So the man goes out, and knows and finds
   himself, through this simple light which has been poured into him, to
   be united and established and penetrated and confirmed, in the unity of
   his spirit or mind. Thereby the man is raised up and set in a new
   state, and he turns inwards, and fixes his memory upon the Nudity,
   above all the distractions of sensible images, and above multiplicity.
   Here the man possesses the essential and supernatural unity of his
   spirit, as his own dwelling-place and as his own eternal, personal
   heritage. He ever has a natural and a supernatural tendency towards
   this same unity; and this same unity through the gifts of God and
   through simplicity of intention, shall have an eternal loving tendency
   towards that most high Unity, where, in the bond of the Holy Ghost, the
   Father and the Son are united with all saints. And thus the first rill,
   which demands unity, is satisfied. [51]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [50] It should be remembered that for the medieval psychologist the
   term "memory" included all that we mean by "mind."

   [51] "The Godhead," says Dionysius, "is celebrated by religion as One
   and as Unity, because of the simplicity and oneness of its supernatural
   indivisibility. Thereby, as by a unifying power, we are unified; and,
   when our various diversities have been gathered together in a
   supernatural way, we are collected into a divine onefoldness and union
   wherein we are like unto God." (Divine Names, cap. 1.)
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXXVII

  THE SECOND RILL ENLIGHTENS THE UNDERSTANDING

   Through inward charity and loving inclination and the faithfulness of
   God, there arises the second rill from the fulness of grace within the
   unity of the spirit; and it is a ghostly light which flows forth and
   shines into the understanding, discerning diverse things. For this
   light shows and proves in truth the distinctions between all the
   virtues; but this does not lie wholly in our power. For, even if we
   always had this light within our souls, it is God Who makes it to be
   silent and to speak, and He may show it and hide it, give it and take
   it away, in any time and place; for this light is His. And He therefore
   works in this light when He wills, and where He wills, and for whom He
   wills, and what He wills. These men have no need of revelations,
   neither of being caught up above the senses; for their life, and
   dwelling-place, their way, and their being, are in the spirit, above
   the senses and above sensibility. And there God shows to such men what
   is His good pleasure, and what is needful for them or for other men.
   Nevertheless God could, were such His will, deprive such men of their
   outward senses, and show them from within unknown similitudes and
   future things in many ways.

   Now Christ wills that this man go out and walk in this light, in the
   way of this light. Therefore this enlightened man shall go out and
   shall mark his state and his life from within and from without, and see
   whether he is perfectly like unto Christ, according to His manhood and
   according to His Godhead. For we have been created in the image and
   after the likeness of God. And he shall raise his enlightened eyes, by
   means of the illuminated reason, to the intelligible Truth, and mark
   and behold in a creaturely way the most high Nature of God and the
   fathomless attributes which are in God: for to a fathomless Nature
   belong fathomless virtues and activities.

   The most high Nature of the Godhead may thus be perceived and beheld:
   how it is Simplicity and Onefoldness, inaccessible Height and
   bottomless Depth, incomprehensible Breadth and eternal Length, a dark
   Silence, a wild Desert, the Rest of all saints in the Unity, and a
   common Fruition of Himself and of all saints in Eternity. And many
   other marvels may be seen in the abysmal Sea of the Godhead; and
   though, because of the grossness of the senses to which they must be
   shown from without, we must use sensible images, yet, in truth, these
   things are perceived and beheld from within, as an abysmal and
   unconditioned Good. But if they must be shown from without, it must be
   done by means of diverse similitudes and images, according to the
   enlightenment of the reason of him who shapes and shows them.

   The enlightened man shall also mark and behold the attributes of the
   Father in the Godhead: how He is omnipotent Power and Might, Creator,
   Mover, Preserver, Beginning and End, the Origin and Being of all
   creatures. This the rill of grace shows to the enlightened reason in
   its radiance. It also shows the attributes of the Eternal Word: abysmal
   Wisdom and Truth, Pattern of all creatures and all life, Eternal and
   unchanging Rule, Seeing all things and Seeing Through all things, none
   of which is hidden from Him; Transillumination and Enlightenment of all
   saints in heaven and on earth, according to the merits of each. And
   even as this rill of radiance shows the distinctions between many
   things, so it also shows to the enlightened reason the attributes of
   the Holy Ghost: incomprehensible Love and Generosity, Compassion and
   Mercy, infinite Faithfulness and Benevolence, inconceivable Greatness,
   outpouring Richness, a limitless Goodness drenching through all
   heavenly spirits with delight, a Flame of Fire which burns all things
   together in the Unity, a flowing Fountain, rich in all savours,
   according to the desire of each; the Preparation of all saints for
   their eternal bliss and their entrance therein, an Embrace and
   Penetration of the Father, the Son, and all saints in fruitive Unity.
   All this is observed and beheld without differentiation or division in
   the simple Nature of the Godhead. And according to our perception these
   attributes abide as Persons do, in manifold distinctions. For between
   might and goodness, between generosity and truth, there are, according
   to our perception great differences. Nevertheless all these are found
   in oneness and undifferentiation in the most high Nature of the
   Godhead. But the relations which make the personal attributes remain in
   eternal distinction. For the Father begets distinction. For the Father
   incessantly begets his Son, and Himself is unbegotten; and the Son is
   begotten, and cannot beget; and thus throughout eternity the Father has
   a Son, and the Son a Father. And these are the relations of the Father
   to the Son, and of the Son to the Father. And the Father and the Son
   breathe forth one Spirit, Who is Their common Will or Love. And this
   Spirit begets not, nor is He begotten; but must eternally pour forth,
   being breathed forth from both the Father and the Son. And these three
   Persons are one God and one Spirit. And all the attributes with the
   works which flow forth from them are common to all the Persons, for
   They work by virtue of Their Onefold Nature. [52]

   The incomprehensible richness and loftiness of the Divine Nature, its
   outpouring generosity toward all in common, fills a man with wonder.
   And, above all, he wonders at the universality of God and His
   outpouring upon all things. For he beholds the incomprehensible Essence
   as a common fruition of God and all saints. And he sees the Divine
   Persons as a common outpouring and a common activity in grace and in
   glory, in nature and above nature, in all places and at all times, in
   saints and in men, in heaven and on earth, in all creatures, rational,
   irrational, and material, according to the merits, the need, and the
   receptivity of each. And he beholds heaven and earth, sun and moon, the
   four elements, together with all creatures, and the course of the
   heavens, created for all in common. God, with all His gifts, is common
   to all: the angels are common: the soul is common to all its powers, to
   the whole body, to all its members, yet in each member is entire; for
   the soul cannot be divided, save by the reason. For though, according
   to the reason, the highest powers and the lowest, the spirit and the
   soul, are certainly divided; yet, in nature, they are one. So too God
   is whole and special to each, and yet common to all creation; for by
   Him all things are; within Him and upon Him, heaven and earth and all
   nature depend. When a man thus considers the wonderful wealth and
   loftiness of the Divine Nature, and all the multiplicity of gifts which
   He gives and offers to His creatures, then there grows up within him a
   wonder at such manifold richness, at such loftiness, and at the
   immeasurable faithfulness of God to His creatures. And thence springs a
   particular inward gladness of the spirit, and a high trust in God, and
   this inward gladness envelops and drenches all the powers of the soul
   and the most inward part of the spirit.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [52] This wonderful description of the attributes of God contains many
   reminiscences of mystical writers, from St Paul onwards: especially St
   Augustine, Dionysius, St Bernard, and Meister Eckhart. Cf. St
   Augustine, Confessions, bk. 1. caps. 3 and 4, Dionysius the Areopagite,
   Divine Names, caps. 1 and 7, and Celestial Hierarchy, cap. 7, St.
   Bernard, de consideratione, bk. v. cap. 8, Meister Eckhart, Predichten.
   There are striking parallels to this and other similar passages in
   Ruysbroeck in the Book of Truth of his contemporary Suso.

CHAPTER XXXVIII

  THE THIRD RILL ESTABLISHES THE WILL TO EVERY PERFECTION

   From this gladness and the fulness of grace and the faithfulness of
   God, there is born and flows forth the third rill in this same unity of
   the spirit. This rill, like a fire, enkindles the will, and swallows up
   and consumes everything into unity. And it fills to the brim and flows
   through all the powers of the soul, with rich gifts and with a singular
   nobility: and it calls forth in the will a tender spiritual love
   without effort.

   Now Christ says inwardly within the spirit by means of this burning
   brook: Go ye out by practices in conformity with these gifts and with
   this coming. By the first rill, which is a simple light, the memory has
   been lifted above sensible images, and has been grounded and
   established in the unity of the spirit. By the second rill, which is an
   inflowing light, understanding and reason have been enlightened, to
   know the diverse ways of virtue and of practice, and discern the
   mysteries of the Scriptures. By the third rill, which is an inpouring
   heat, the supreme will has been enkindled in tranquil love, and has
   been endowed with great riches. Thus has this man become spiritually
   enlightened; for the grace of God dwells like a fountainhead in the
   unity of his spirit; and its rills cause in the powers an outflowing
   with all the virtues. And the fountainhead of grace ever demands a
   flowing-back into the same source from whence the flood proceeds.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXXIX

  SHOWING HOW THE ESTABLISHED MAN SHALL GO OUT IN FOUR WAYS

   Now the man who is established in the bonds of love shall dwell in the
   unity of the spirit; and he shall go out with enlightened reason and
   with overflowing love in heaven and on earth; and he shall mark all
   things with clear discernment; and he shall dispense and distribute all
   things, out of true generosity, and because of his richness in God.

   In four ways this enlightened man is invited and urged to go out. The
   first going out shall be towards God and towards all saints; the second
   going out shall be towards sinners and towards all perverted men; the
   third going out shall be towards purgatory; and the fourth, towards
   himself and towards all good men.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XL

  HE SHALL GO OUT TOWARDS GOD AND TOWARDS ALL SAINTS

   Now understand this: this man shall go out and observe God in His glory
   with all saints. And he shall behold the rich and generous outflowing
   of God, with glory, and with Himself, and with inconceivable delights
   towards all the saints, according to the longing of all spirits; and
   how these flow back, with themselves, and with all that they have
   received and can achieve, towards that same rich Oneness from which all
   bliss comes forth.

   This flowing forth of God always demands a flowing back; for God is a
   Sea that ebbs and flows, pouring without ceasing into all His beloved
   according to the need and the merits of each, and ebbing back again
   with all those who have been thus endowed both in heaven and on earth,
   with all that they have and all that they can. And of some He demands
   more than they are able to bring, for He shows Himself so rich and so
   generous and so boundlessly good: and in showing Himself thus He
   demands love and adoration according to His worth. For God wishes to be
   loved by us according to the measure of His nobility, and in this all
   spirits fail; and therefore their love becomes wayless and without
   manner, for they know not how they may fulfil it, nor how they may come
   to it. For the love of all spirits is measured: and for this reason
   their love perpetually begins anew, so that God may be loved according
   to His demand and to the spirit's own desires. And this is why all
   blessed spirits perpetually gather themselves together and form a
   burning flame of love, that they may fulfil this work, and that God may
   be loved according to His nobility. Reason shows clearly that to
   creatures this is impossible; but love always wills the fulfilment of
   love, or else will be consumed, burned up, annihilated in its own
   failure. Yet God is never loved according to His worth by any
   creatures. And to the enlightened reason this is a great delight and
   satisfaction: that its God and its Beloved is so high and so rich that
   He transcends all created powers, and can be loved according to His
   merits by none save Himself.

   This rich and enlightened man shall distribute gifts to all the angelic
   choirs, and all spirits, each in particular according to its merits,
   out of the richness of his God and out of the generosity of his own
   ground; which is illuminated and overflowing with great and wonderful
   gifts. He passes through all choirs, through all hierarchies and
   orders, and beholds how God dwells in all according to the merit of
   each. This enlightened man goes swiftly and in ghostly wise round and
   through all the heavenly hosts, rich and overflowing with charity, and
   enriching and inundating the whole celestial company with fresh glory
   out of the Richness and Abundance of the Trinity and Unity of the
   Divine Nature.

   This is the first going out, towards God and towards all saints.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XLI

  HE SHALL GO OUT TOWARDS ALL SINNERS

   At times this same man shall descend towards sinners, with great
   compassion, and with generous mercy, and shall bring them before God
   with fervent devotion and with much prayer; bringing to God's
   remembrance all the good which He is, and all His power, and all that
   He has done for us, and has promised us, right as though He had
   forgotten all this: for God wills that we beseech Him. And charity
   shall obtain all that it desires; nevertheless it must not be stubborn
   and self-willed, but must leave all to the rich goodness and to the
   generosity of God: for God loves without measure, and herein the lover
   best finds his peace. Now, since this man bears a common love to all,
   he prays and beseeches God that His love and His mercy may flow forth
   towards Pagans and towards Jews and towards all unbelievers, that He
   may be loved and known and praised in heaven, and that our glory, our
   joy and our peace may spread to all the ends of the earth.

   This is the second going out, towards sinners.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XLII

  HE SHALL GO OUT TOWARDS HIS FRIENDS IN PURGATORY

   At times the man shall behold his friends in purgatory, and shall
   consider their misery and their yearnings and their heavy pains. Then
   shall he pray and beseech the pity, the mercy, and the generosity of
   God; and shall plead their good-will, and their great misery, and their
   yearning after the rich goodness of God, and he shall bring to God's
   remembrance that they died in love, and that their only refuge is in
   His passion and mercy.

   Now understand this: it may sometimes happen that this enlightened man
   is specially urged of the Spirit of God to pray for a certain thing,
   for some sinner, or for some soul, or for some ghostly benefit, in such
   a way that he feels and understands it to be the work of the Holy
   Ghost, and not of his own choice, or self-will, or nature. Then the man
   sometimes becomes so intense and so ardent in his prayer that he
   receives in ghostly wise the answer that his prayer has been heard. And
   with the coming of this sign the thrust of the Spirit and the prayer
   abate.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XLIII

  HE SHALL GO OUT TOWARDS HIMSELF AND TOWARDS ALL GOOD MEN

   Now the man shall go out towards himself and towards all men of
   good-will, and shall taste and behold how that they are tied and bound
   together in love; and he shall beseech and pray God that He may let His
   customary gifts flow forth, that thereby all may be confirmed in His
   love and His eternal worship. This enlightened man shall faithfully and
   discreetly teach and instruct, reprove and serve, all men; for he bears
   in him a love towards all. And thereby is he a mediator between God and
   all men. And then he shall turn wholly inwards upon himself with all
   the saints and with all the just, and possess in peace the unity of his
   spirit, and therewith the most high Unity of God, wherein all spirits
   rest. This is a true ghostly life; for all the degrees and all the
   virtues, inward as well as outward, and the highest powers of the soul,
   are supernaturally adorned by it in a right and profitable way.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XLIV

  SHOWING HOW WE MAY RECOGNISE THOSE MEN WHO FAIL IN CHARITY TO ALL

   There are some men who are very subtle in words, and skilful in showing
   forth high things, and yet do not enjoy this enlightened condition,
   neither this common and generous charity. In order that these men may
   learn to know themselves, and also may be known of others, I will
   distinguish them by three signs. By the first sign they may be known of
   themselves, and by the two others they may be recognised of all men of
   understanding.

   The first sign: Whereas the enlightened man, by virtue of the Divine
   light, is simple and stable and free from curious considerations, these
   others are manifold and restless and full of subtle reasonings and
   reflections, and they do not taste inward unity, nor the satisfaction
   which is without images. And by this they may know themselves.

   The second sign: Whereas the enlightened man possesses a wisdom
   inpoured by God, wherein he knows and distinguishes the truth without
   effort, these men have shrewd and sudden notions, with which they work
   in their imagination, and which they display and develop with much
   cunning. But their ground is barren and they cannot bring forth
   fruitful doctrine. Their doctrines are manifold, they are concerned
   with outward things and addressed to the understanding. And thereby
   inward men are troubled, hindered, and led astray. They neither lead
   nor point to unity; but they teach subtle observations in multiplicity.
   Such people hold obstinately to their own doctrine and opinion, even
   though another opinion be as good as their own. And they are idle and
   careless as regards all virtues. Spiritual pride is in all their being.
   This is the second sign.

   The third sign: Whereas the enlightened and loving man flows forth in
   love towards all in heaven and on earth, as you have heard, this other
   man sets himself apart in all things. He thinks himself to be the
   wisest and the best of all; and desires that others should think highly
   of him and his teaching. All those whom he does not teach and advise,
   all those who do not follow his way of life and do not cling to him as
   their master, these seem to him to be sunk in error. He is large and
   spacious in satisfying his bodily needs, and little faults do not count
   heavily with him. This man is neither just, nor humble, nor generous,
   nor a servant of the poor, nor inward, nor fervent, nor does he feel
   the love of God. He knows neither God, nor his own being, in the way of
   true virtue. This is the third sign.

   Mark these, and study them, and cast them out of yourselves, and out of
   all men in whom you remark them; but condemn no one for such things
   unless it be that they have proved it by their deeds, for this would
   soil your heart and would hinder it in the knowledge of Divine truth.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XLV

  HOW CHRIST WAS, IS, AND EVER WILL BE THE LOVER OF ALL

   In order that we shall possess and desire this state of being common to
   all above the other conditions of which we have spoken (because this
   state is the highest of all) we shall take as a model Christ, Who was,
   and is, and eternally shall remain common to all; for He was sent down
   to earth for the common benefit of all men who would turn to Him.

   Yet He Himself says that He is not sent but unto the lost sheep of the
   house of Israel. These, however, are not only the Jews, but all those
   who shall see God in eternity. These belong to the house of Israel, and
   no one else; for the Jews despised the Gospel, and the Heathen entered
   and received it. And so all Israel, that is to say, all the eternally
   chosen, shall be saved.

   Now mark how Christ gave Himself to all in perfect loyalty. His inward
   and sublime prayer flowed forth towards His Father, and it was a prayer
   for all in common who desired to be saved. Christ was common to all in
   love, in teaching, in tender consolation, in generous gifts, in
   merciful forgiveness. His soul and His body, His life and His death and
   His ministry were, and are, common to all. His sacraments and His gifts
   are common to all. Christ never took any food or drink, nor anything
   that His body needed, without intending by it the common good of all
   those who shall be saved, even unto the last day. Christ had nothing
   particular and of his own, but everything in common, body and soul,
   mother and disciples, cloak and tunic. He ate and He drank for our
   sake; He lived and He died for our sake. His pains and His sorrows and
   His miseries were of His own and for Him only; but the fruits and the
   profit which came forth from them are common to all. And the glory of
   His merits shall be common to all in eternity.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XLVI

  REPROVING ALL THOSE WHO LIVE ON SPIRITUAL GOODS IN AN INORDINATE MANNER

   Now Christ left His treasure and His revenue here on earth. These are
   the seven sacraments and the outward goods of Holy Church, which He has
   gotten through His death, and which, therefore, should be in common.
   And His servants, who live thereon, should therefore be in common. All
   those who live on alms and are in the ecclesiastical state, should be
   in common at least in their prayers: and especially all religious who
   live in cloisters and in cells. In the beginning of Holy Church and of
   our Faith, popes, bishops, and priests, were all in common; for they
   went out and converted the folk, and established Holy Church and our
   Faith, and sealed them with their blood and with their death. These men
   were simple and onefold, and they had steadfast peace in the unity of
   the spirit. And they were enlightened with godly wisdom, rich and
   overflowing with faith and with love towards God and towards all men.
   But now, notwithstanding it is become wholly otherwise; for those who
   to-day possess the heritage and the revenue which were given to those
   others out of love and because of their holiness, are unstable of soul,
   and restless, and in multiplicity; for they have altogether turned
   towards the world, and do not thoroughly apprehend in their ground
   those things and that business which they have in hand. That is why
   they pray with their lips, but their heart does not savour the meaning,
   that is to say, it does not feel the secret wonder which is hidden in
   Scripture, and in the sacraments, and in their office. And therefore
   they are coarse and dull, and are not enlightened by the Divine truth,
   and they often seek food and drink and ease of body without moderation:
   would to God they were at least clean of fleshly sins! As long as they
   live thus, they shall never be enlightened; and whereas those others
   were generous, and overflowing with charity, and kept nothing for
   themselves, these are now greedy and avaricious, and deny themselves
   nothing. All this is contrary and unlike to the saints, and to that
   common way of which we have spoken. I speak of the general state of
   things: let each prove himself, and teach and reprove himself, if needs
   be; and, if not, let him rejoice and rest in peace in his clean
   conscience, and serve and praise God, for the good of himself and of
   all men, and for the glory of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XLVII

  SHOWING HOW CHRIST HAS GIVEN HIMSELF TO ALL IN COMMON IN THE SACRAMENT OF THE
  ALTAR

   As I will specially praise and glorify this state of being in common,
   so I find another special treasure which Christ has left in Holy Church
   to all good men; in His supper upon the high feast of the Passover when
   Christ knew that He would pass from this exile to His father, after He
   had eaten of the Paschal Lamb with His disciples, and the ancient law
   had been fulfilled. At the end of the meal and of the feast, He desired
   to give to them a dish of singular excellence which He had long wished
   to do. And herewith He willed to make an end of the ancient law and
   begin the new. And He took bread in His holy and venerable hands, and
   consecrated His sacred Body, and after that His sacred Blood; and He
   gave them both to all His disciples, and left them to all good men in
   common for their eternal profit. This gift and this excellent dish
   rejoice and adorn all high festivals and all banquets, in heaven and on
   earth. In this gift Christ gives Himself to us in three ways. He gives
   us His Flesh and His Blood and His bodily life, glorified and full of
   joy and sweetness; He gives us His spirit with its highest powers, full
   of glory and gifts, truth and righteousness; and He gives us His
   personality through that Divine Light which raises His spirit and all
   enlightened spirits into the most high and fruitive unity.

   Now Christ desires that we shall remember Him so often as we
   consecrate, offer, and receive His Body. Consider now how we shall
   remember Him. We shall mark and behold how Christ inclines Himself
   towards us with loving affection, with great desire, and with yearning
   delight, and with a warm and tender outpouring of Himself into our
   bodily nature. For He gives us that which He has in common with our
   manhood, that is, His Flesh and His Blood, and His bodily nature. We
   shall also mark and behold that precious body martyred, pierced and
   wounded for our sake, because of His love and His faithfulness towards
   us. Herewith we are adorned and nourished in the lower part of our
   manhood. In this most high gift of the Sacrament He also gives us His
   spirit, full of glory and rich gifts of virtue, and unspeakable marvels
   of charity and nobleness. And herewith we are nourished and adorned and
   enlightened in the unity of our spirit and in the higher powers,
   through the indwelling of Christ with all His riches. Moreover He gives
   us in the Sacrament of the Altar His most high personality in
   incomprehensible splendour. And through this we are lifted up to and
   united with the Father, and the Father receives His adopted sons
   together with His natural Son, and thus we enter into our inheritance
   of the Godhead in eternal blessedness.

   When a man has worthily recollected and considered these things, then
   he shall go out to meet Christ in the same way in which Christ comes to
   him. He shall lift himself up to receive Christ with his heart, with
   his desire, with sensible love, with all his powers, and with a joyful
   craving. For even thus does Christ receive Himself. And this craving
   cannot be too great; for then our nature receives its own nature, that
   is, the glorified manhood of Christ, full of joy and worth. Therefore I
   would that a man, in thus receiving, should melt and flow forth in
   desire, in joy, and in delight: for he embraces and is united with Him
   who is the fairest, the most gracious and most lovable of all the
   children of men. In this yearning devotion, and in these delights, many
   a great benefit has been bestowed upon men, and many a secret and
   hidden wonder of the rich treasures of God has been revealed and
   disclosed to them. When a man, in thus receiving, bethinks himself of
   the martyrdom and the sufferings of this precious Body of Christ, which
   he receives, then he may sometimes rise into such loving devotion and
   such sensible compassion that he desires to be nailed with Christ to
   the cross, and longs to shed his heart's blood for the glory of Christ.
   And he presses into the wounds and into the open heart of Christ, his
   Saviour. In this exercise many a revelation and many a benefit have
   often been bestowed upon men.

   This sensible love and compassion, and the power of the imagination
   united with the inward contemplation of the wounds of Christ, may be so
   great, that the man thinks that he feels the wounds and the bruises of
   Christ in his own heart and in all his limbs. And if any man could
   indeed in any way receive the stigmata of our Lord, it would be such a
   man as this. And herewith we satisfy Christ as regards the lower part
   of His manhood.

   We shall also dwell in the unity of our spirit and should flow forth
   with an ample love in heaven and on earth, with clear discernment. And
   by this we bear some resemblance to Christ as regards the spirit, and
   give Him satisfaction.

   We shall also, through the personality of Christ, with simplicity of
   intention and with fruitive love, transcend ourselves, and also the
   created being of Christ, and rest in our inheritance, that is, in the
   Divine Being in eternity. This Christ always desires to give us in
   ghostly wise, whenever we so exercise ourselves and make ourselves in
   readiness for Him. And He desires that we shall receive Him both in a
   sacramental and a spiritual way, as is meet and right and as reason
   demands. Though a man may not always have such feelings and such
   desires, if he intend the praise of God and His glory, and the increase
   of his own being and blessedness, he may go freely to the table of the
   Lord, if his conscience be clean from mortal sin.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XLVIII

  OF THE UNITY OF THE DIVINE NATURE IN THE TRINITY OF THE PERSONS

   The most high and superessential Unity of the Divine Nature, where the
   Father and the Son possess Their nature in the unity of the Holy
   Ghost--above the comprehension and understanding of all our powers, in
   the naked being of our spirit--is a supernal stillness, wherein God
   broods above all creatures in the created light. This most high Unity
   of the Divine Nature is living and fruitful; for, out of this same
   Unity, the Eternal Word is incessantly born of the Father. And, through
   this birth, the Father knows the Son; and, in the Son, all things. And
   the Son knows the Father; and all things in the Father. For they are
   one Simple Nature. From this mutual contemplation of the Father and the
   Son, in the eternal radiance, there flow forth an eternal content [53]
   and a fathomless love, and that is the Holy Ghost. And through the Holy
   Ghost, and through the Eternal Wisdom, God inclines Himself towards
   each creature in particular, and lovingly endows and enkindles each
   one, according to its worth and the state into which it has been put
   and to which it has been destined by its virtues and by the Eternal
   Providence of God. And thereby all good spirits, in heaven and on
   earth, are moved to virtue and righteousness.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [53] The Flemish "welbehagen" is perhaps more accurately translated
   "well-being," "comfort" or "good pleasure." Cf. The Book of Truth, cap.
   10. The idea intended is the complete and blissful self-comprehension
   and self-satisfaction of the Divine Essence; the "perfect round" which
   is enringed in love. So Dante-- "O luce eterna, che sola in te sidi,
   sola t'intendi, e, da te intelletta ed intendente te, ami ed arridi!"
   (Par. xxxiii. 124.)
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XLIX

  SHOWING HOW GOD POSSESSES AND MOVES THE SOUL BOTH IN A NATURAL AND A
  SUPERNATURAL WAY

   Now mark well: I will show you an image of this. God has created the
   highest heaven, a pure and simple Radiance, which enrings and encloses
   all the heavens and all bodily and material things that God has ever
   created; for it is an outward dwelling-place and a kingdom of God and
   His saints, full of glory and eternal joy. Now since this heaven is an
   unmingled Radiance, there is here neither time, nor space, nor
   movement, nor any change; for it is immovable and unchangeable above
   all things. The sphere which is nearest to this glowing heaven is
   called the First Movement. For here all movement arises from the
   highest heaven, by the Power of God. From this movement the firmament
   and all planets derive their courses. And, through it, all creatures
   live and grow, each according to its kind [54] . Now understand this
   well: so likewise the essence of the soul is a ghostly kingdom of God,
   full of Divine radiance transcending all our powers, except they be in
   that simplified state of which I will not speak now. Behold, in regard
   to the essence of the soul, wherein God reigns, the unity of our spirit
   is like to the First Movement; for, in this unity, the spirit is moved
   from above by the power of God, both naturally and supernaturally. For
   we have nothing of our own, neither in nature, nor above nature. And
   this stirring of God, when it is supernatural, is the first and
   principle cause of all virtues. And through this stirring of God, there
   are given to some men the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost, like to the
   seven planets, which illuminate and make fruitful the whole life of
   man. This is the way in which God possesses the essential unity of our
   spirit as His kingdom; and in which He works and flows forth with His
   gifts into our potential unity and into all our powers.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [54] Here again Ruysbroeck and Dante, both depending upon scholastic
   conceptions of the Universe, are in close agreement. Ruysbroeck's
   "heaven of unmingled radiance" is the Empyrean "ch' é pura luce" (Par.
   xxx. 39): from this the Primum Mobile, or first revolving heaven, takes
   and distributes the power by which all creation is moved. "E questo
   cielo non ha altro dove che la mente divina, in che s'accende l'amor
   che il volge e la virt ch' ei piove." (Par. xxvii. 109.)
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER L

  SHOWING HOW A MAN SHOULD BE ADORNED IF HE IS TO RECEIVE THE MOST INWARD
  EXERCISE

   Now consider diligently how we can acquire and possess the most inward
   exercise of our spirit in the created light. The man who is well
   adorned with the moral virtues of the outward life, and has risen into
   nobility and divine peace by inward practices; he possesses the unity
   of the spirit, enlightened by supernatural wisdom, flowing forth in
   generous love toward heaven and earth and lifting itself up by its
   reverence and its merits, and flowing back into that very ground, the
   most high Unity of God, from which all things proceed. For each
   creature, according to whether it has received more or less from God,
   has more or less of ascending love and inward tendency towards its
   origin; for God and all His gifts invite us into Him, and through
   charity and the virtues and resemblance, we desire to enter into Him.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER LI

  OF THE THIRD COMING OF CHRIST

   Through this loving inclination of God, and His inward working in the
   unity of our spirit, and further through our glowing love and the
   pressing of all our powers together into the very unity in which God
   dwells, there arises the third coming of Christ in inward working. And
   this is an inward touch or stirring of Christ in His Divine brightness,
   in the inmost part of our spirit. The second coming, of which we have
   spoken, we have likened to a fountain, pouring forth in three rills.
   But this coming we will liken to the duct which feeds the fountain. For
   there is no rill without a fountain; and no fountain without a living
   duct. So likewise the grace of God flows forth like rills into the
   higher powers, and impels and enkindles a man in all virtue. And this
   grace springs up within the unity of our spirit like a fountain, and
   falls back again into that same unity whence it arises; even as a
   living and gushing spring which comes forth from the living ground of
   the Divine Richness, where neither faithfulness nor grace can ever
   fail. And this is the touch which I mean. And the creature passively
   endures this touch. For here there is a union of the higher powers
   within the unity of the spirit, above the multiplicity of all the
   virtues, and here no one works save God alone, in untrammelled
   goodness; which is the cause of all our virtues and of all blessedness.
   In the unity of the spirit, into which this duct gushes forth, one is
   above activity and above reason, though not without reason. For the
   enlightened reason, and especially the power of love, feels this touch;
   and reason cannot understand, nor can it comprehend, the way or the
   means of this touch, how or what it is, for it is a working of God, the
   upspringing and the inrushing of all graces and gifts, and the last
   intermediary between God and the creature. And above this touch, in the
   still being of the spirit, there broods an incomprehensible Brightness.
   And that is the most high Trinity whence this touch proceeds. There God
   lives and reigns in the spirit, and the spirit in God.

CHAPTER LII

  SHOWING HOW THE SPIRIT GOES OUT THROUGH THE DIVINE STIRRING

   Now, through this touch, Christ says inwardly within the spirit: Go ye
   out with practices in conformity with this touch. For this deep touch
   draws and invites our spirit to the most inward practices which a
   creature is able to fulfil in a creaturely way in the created light.
   Here the spirit raises itself, through the power of love, above all
   works, into the unity where this life-giving spring or touch gushes
   forth. And this touch invites the understanding to know God in His
   brightness, and it draws and invites the power of love to enjoy God
   without intermediary. And this the loving spirit desires to do, both in
   a natural and a supernatural way, above all other things. By means of
   the enlightened reason the spirit lifts itself up in inward
   observation, and it beholds and observes the most inward part of
   itself, where this touch lives. Here reason and every created light
   fail and can go no further. For the Supernal Brightness brooding over
   all, which gives rise to this touch, blinds in its coming every created
   sight; for it is abysmal. And all understanding in the created light is
   here like the eyes of a bat in the light of the sun. Yet the spirit is
   continually invited and urged anew by God and by itself to sound and to
   know that which is stirring these deeps, and what God is, and what this
   touch is. And the enlightened reason ever asks anew, whence this comes,
   and ever seeks to explore further, that it may follow back this stream
   of honey to its source. But in this it is, on the first day, as wise as
   it shall ever be. And this is why reason and all observation say: "I
   know not what it is," for the Supernal Brightness brooding over all,
   strikes back all understanding and blinds it whenever they meet.

   So God abides in His brightness above all spirits who are in heaven and
   on earth. And those who have pierced through their ground by means of
   the virtues and inward practices, to their source, that is, to the door
   of eternal life, may feel this touch. There the Brightness of God
   shines so mightily that reason and all understanding fail and can go no
   further, but must be overcome and give way before the incomprehensible
   Brightness of God. But when the spirit feels this in its ground, then,
   though its reason and understanding fail before the Divine Brightness,
   and must remain outside the door, the power of love desires to go
   forward; for it too, like the understanding, has been invited and
   urged. And it is blind and desires fruition; and fruition abides more
   in tasting and feeling than in understanding. Therefore would love go
   forward, whilst understanding stays outside.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER LIII

  OF AN ETERNAL HUNGER FOR GOD

   Here there begins an eternal hunger, which shall never more be
   satisfied; it is an inward craving and hankering of the loving power
   and the created spirit after an untreated Good. And since the spirit
   longs for fruition, and is invited and urged thereto by God, it must
   always desire its fulfilment. Behold, here there begins an eternal
   craving and continual yearning in eternal insatiableness. All such are
   the poorest of all men living; for they are avid and greedy, and their
   hunger is insatiable. Whatever they eat or drink, they shall never be
   satisfied, for this hunger is eternal. For a created vessel cannot
   contain an uncreated Good: and hence there is here an eternal, hungry
   craving without satisfaction, and God poured forth above all and yet
   staying it not. Here are great dishes of food and drink, of which no
   one knows save he who tastes them: but full satisfaction in fruition is
   the dish which is lacking there, and therefore this hunger is ever
   renewed. Yet, in the touch, rivers of honey, full of all delights, flow
   forth; for the spirit tastes these riches in all the ways which it can
   conceive and apprehend; but all this is in a creaturely way and below
   God, and hence there remains an eternal hunger and impatience. Though
   God gave to such a man all the gifts which are possessed by all the
   saints, and everything that He is able to give, but withheld Himself,
   the gaping desire of the spirit would remain hungry and unsatisfied.
   The inward stirring and touching of God makes us hungry and yearning;
   for the Spirit of God hunts our spirit: and the more it touches it, the
   greater our hunger and our craving. And this is the life of love in its
   highest working, above reason and above understanding; for reason can
   here neither give nor take away from love, for our love is touched by
   the Divine love. And as I understand it, here there can never more be
   separation from God. God's touch within us, forasmuch as we feel it,
   and our own loving craving, these are both created and creaturely; and
   therefore they may grow and increase as long as we live.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER LIV

  OF A LOVING STRIFE BETWEEN THE SPIRIT OF GOD AND OUR SPIRIT

   In this storm of love two spirits strive together: the spirit of God
   and our own spirit. God, through the Holy Ghost, inclines Himself
   towards us; and, thereby, we are touched in love. And our spirit, by
   God's working and by the power of love, presses and inclines itself
   into God: and, thereby, God is touched. From these two contacts there
   arises the strife of love, at the very deeps of this meeting; and in
   that most inward and ardent encounter, each spirit is deeply wounded by
   love. These two spirits, that is our own spirit and the Spirit of God,
   sparkle and shine one into the other, and each shows to the other its
   face. This makes each of the spirits yearn for the other in love. Each
   demands of the other all that it is; and each offers to the other all
   that it is and invites it to all that it is. This makes the lovers melt
   into each other. God's touch and His gifts, our loving craving and our
   giving back: these fulfil love. This flux and reflux causes the
   fountain of love to brim over: and thus the touch of God and our loving
   craving become one simple love. Here man is possessed by love, so that
   he must forget himself and God, and knows and can do nothing but love.
   Thereby the spirit is burned up in the fire of love, and enters so
   deeply into the touch of God, that it is overcome in all its cravings,
   and turned to nought in all its works, and empties itself; above all
   surrender becoming very love. And it possesses, above all virtues, the
   inmost part of its created being, where every creaturely work begins
   and ends. Such is love in itself, foundation and origin of all virtues.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER LV

  OF THE FRUITFUL WORKS OF THE SPIRIT, THE WHICH ARE ETERNAL

   Now our spirit and this love are living and fruitful in virtues; and
   for this reason the powers can no longer remain idle in the unity of
   the spirit. For the incomprehensible brightness of God and His
   boundless love brood above the spirit, and touch the loving power; and
   the spirit goes forth once more into its works, but with a more sublime
   and inward striving than ever before. And the more noble and inward it
   is, the more quickly it is spent and brought to nought in love, and
   goes forth once more into fresh works. And this is heavenly love. For
   ever does the craving spirit yearn to eat and to swallow God; but
   itself is swallowed up in the touch of God, and fails in all its works.
   For the highest powers are made one in the unity of the spirit. Here
   are grace and love in their essence, above all works; for here is the
   source of charity and every virtue. Here there is an eternal outflow
   into charity and the virtues, and an eternal return with inward hunger
   for the taste of God, and an eternal dwelling within in pure love. And
   all this is in a creaturely way and below God; it is the most inward
   exercise which one can perform in the created light, in heaven and on
   earth; and above it there is nothing but the God-seeing life in the
   Divine light and in the Godlike way. In this exercise one cannot go
   astray, nor can one be deceived; and it begins in grace, and shall for
   ever last in glory.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER LVI

  SHOWING THE WAY IN WHICH WE SHALL MEET GOD IN A GHOSTLY MANNER BOTH WITH AND
  WITHOUT MEANS [55]

   Now I have shown you how the free and uplifted man becomes, through the
   grace of God, seeing in his inward practices. And we see that this is
   the first point which Christ demands and desires of us where He says:
   Behold. As to the second and third points, wherein He says: The
   Bridegroom cometh, and: Go ye out, I have shown you the three ways of
   the inward coming of Christ; and further that the first coming has four
   degrees, and how we are to go out with practices answering to each way
   in which God inwardly enkindles, teaches, and moves us. Now we must
   consider the fourth point, which is the last. This is the meeting with
   Christ our Bridegroom. For all our inward and ghostly vision, in grace
   or in glory, and all our going out in the virtues, in whatsoever
   practices this be done, it is all for the sake of a meeting and a union
   with Christ our Bridegroom: for He is our eternal rest and the end and
   wage of all our labour.

   You know that every meeting is a coming together of two persons, who
   come from different places, which are separated from, and opposite to,
   each other. Now Christ comes from above as a Lord and generous Giver,
   who can do all things. And we come from below as the poor servants, who
   can do nothing of ourselves, but have need of everything. The coming of
   Christ to us is from within outwards, and we go towards Him from
   without inwards; and this is why a ghostly meeting must here take
   place. And this coming and this meeting of ourselves and Christ takes
   place in two ways, to wit, with means and without means.

   symbols and conceptual images; and unmediated, being given as a direct
   intuitive experience to the soul in the unity of the spirit.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER LVII

  OF THE ESSENTIAL MEETING WITH GOD WITHOUT MEANS IN THE NAKEDNESS OF OUR NATURE

   Now understand and mark this well. The unity of our spirit has two
   conditions: it is essential, and it is active. You must know that the
   spirit, according to its essence, receives the coming of Christ in the
   nakedness of its nature, without means and without interruption. For
   the being and the life which we are in God, in our Eternal Image, and
   which we have within ourselves according to our essence, this is
   without means and indivisible. And this is why the spirit, in its
   inmost and highest part, that is in its naked nature, receives without
   interruption the impress of its Eternal Archetype, and the Divine
   Brightness; and is an eternal dwelling-place of God in which God dwells
   as an eternal Presence, and which He visits perpetually, with new
   comings and with new instreamings of the ever-renewed brightness of His
   eternal birth. For where He comes, there He is; and where He is, there
   He comes. And where He has never been, thereto He shall never come; for
   neither chance nor change are in Him. And everything in which He is, is
   in Him; for He never goes out of Himself. And this is why the spirit in
   its essence possesses God in the nakedness of its nature, as God does
   the spirit: for it lives in God and God in it. And it is able, in its
   highest part, to receive, without intermediary, the Brightness of God,
   and all that God can fulfil. And by means of the brightness of its
   Eternal Archetype, which shines in it essentially and personally, the
   spirit plunges itself and loses itself, as regards the highest part of
   its life, [56] in the Divine Being, and there abidingly possesses its
   eternal blessedness; and it flows forth again, through the eternal
   birth of the Son, together with all the other creatures, and is set in
   its created being by the free will of the Holy Trinity. And here it is
   like unto the image of the most high Trinity in Unity, in which it has
   been made. And, in its created being, it incessantly receives the
   impress of its Eternal Archetype, like a flawless mirror, in which the
   image remains steadfast, and in which the reflection is renewed without
   interruption by its ever-new reception in new light. This essential
   union of our spirit with God does not exist in itself, but it dwells in
   God, and it flows forth from God, and it depends upon God, and it
   returns to God as to its Eternal Origin. [57] And in this wise it has
   never been, nor ever shall be, separated from God; for this union is
   within us by our naked nature, and, were this nature to be separated
   from God, it would fall into pure nothingness. And this union is above
   time and space, and is always and incessantly active according to the
   way of God. But our nature, forasmuch as it is indeed like unto God but
   in itself is creature. receives the impress of its Eternal Image
   passively. This is that nobleness which we possess by nature in the
   essential unity of our spirit, where it is united with God according to
   nature. This neither makes us holy nor blessed, for all men, whether
   good or evil, possess it within themselves; but it is certainly the
   first cause of all holiness and all blessedness. This is the meeting
   and the union between God and our spirit in the nakedness of our
   nature.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [56] The word is "levendicheit," really meaning the vital essence of
   the soul: that "life-giving life" which Ruysbroeck, following St
   Bernard, regards as the link between the soul's essence and the Divine
   Essence, and the vivid source of our life in time. Thus for him the
   spiritual man is a "levende mensche": more vividly alive than those in
   whom this germ of Eternity has not been quickened.

   [57] Thus Dionysius-- "Every essence, power, energy, condition,
   perception, reason, conception, contact, knowledge and union--in a
   word, all things existing--are from the Beautiful and Good, and in the
   Beautiful and Good, and return towards the Beautiful and Good." (Divine
   Names, cap. 4.)
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER LVIII

  SHOWING HOW ONE IS LIKE UNTO GOD THROUGH GRACE AND UNLIKE UNTO GOD THROUGH
  MORTAL SIN

   Now consider this thought earnestly; for if you understand well that
   which I will now tell you, and that which I have told you, you will
   have understood all the Divine truth which any creature can teach you,
   and far more besides. Otherwise does our spirit keep itself in that
   same unity when it is conceived as acting or working: for then it
   exists in itself as in its created and personal being. This is the
   source of the higher powers, and here there are beginning and end of
   all the creaturely works which are worked in a creaturely way, both in
   nature and above nature. Yet here the unity does not work forasmuch as
   it is unity; but all the powers of the soul, in what way soever they
   work, derive their strength and their power from their proper source,
   that is, from the unity of the spirit, where it dwells in its personal
   being.

   In this unity, the spirit must always either be like unto God through
   grace and virtue, or unlike unto God through mortal sin. For, that man
   has been made after the likeness of God, means that he has been created
   in the grace of God; the which grace is a God-formed light, which
   shines through us and makes us like to God; and without this light,
   which makes us God-like, we cannot be united with God supernaturally,
   even though we cannot lose the image of God nor our natural unity with
   Him [58] . If we lose the likeness, that is, the grace of God, we are
   damned. And therefore, whenever God finds within us some capacity for
   the reception of His grace, it is His pleasure and His free goodness to
   make us through His gifts, full of life, and like unto Him. This always
   happens whenever we turn to Him with our whole will; for at that very
   moment, Christ comes to us and in us, both with means and without
   means, that is, with the virtues and above the virtues. And He
   impresses His image and His likeness in us, namely Himself and His
   gifts: and He redeems us from sin, and makes us free and like unto
   Himself. And in that same working, through which God redeems us from
   sins, and makes us free and like unto Him through charity, the spirit
   immerses itself in fruitive love [59] . And here there take place a
   meeting and a union which are without means and above nature, and
   wherein our highest blessedness consists. Although all that He gives us
   from love and free goodness is natural to God, for us, according to our
   condition, it is accidental and supernatural. For before, we were
   strangers and unlike unto God; and afterwards, becoming like Him, have
   received union with God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [58] This is the scholastic doctrine of the lumen gloriae. See
   Introduction, p. xxv.

   [59] "Onsinct die gheest hem selven in ghebrukeliker minnen"--the
   spirit, as regards its separate consciousness, drowns and loses itself
   in the Eternal Love of God. This immersion, self-mergence, or sinking
   of the spirit into the One which is its home, is the "completing
   opposite" of that other action of grace, which thrusts the self out
   with its powers as a free and energetic instrument of the Divine Will:
   thus perfecting the soul's dual likeness to God, in work and in rest.
   Compare Ch. LXIII, "The Gift of Understanding."
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER LIX

  SHOWING HOW ONE POSSESSES GOD IN UNION AND REST, ABOVE ALL LIKENESS THROUGH
  GRACE

   This meeting and this union, which the loving spirit achieves in God
   and possesses without means, must take place in the essential
   intuition, deeply hidden from our understanding; unless it be an
   effective understanding according to the way of simplicity [60] . In
   the fruition of this unity we shall rest evermore, above ourselves and
   above all things. From this unity, all gifts, both natural and
   supernatural, flow forth, and yet the loving spirit rests in this unity
   above all gifts; and here there is nothing but God, and the spirit
   united with God without means. In this unity we are taken possession of
   by the Holy Ghost, and we take possession of the Holy Ghost and the
   Father and the Son, and the whole Divine Nature: for God cannot be
   divided. And the fruitive tendency of the spirit [61] , which seeks
   rest in God above all likeness, receives and possesses in a
   supernatural way, in its essential being, all that the spirit ever
   received in a natural way. All good men experience this; but how it is,
   this remains hidden from them all their life long if they do not become
   inward and empty of all creatures. In that very moment in which man
   turns away from sin, he is received by God in the essential unity of
   his own being, at the summit of his spirit, that he may rest in God,
   now and evermore. And he also receives grace, and likeness unto God, in
   the proper source of his powers, that he may evermore grow and increase
   in new virtues. And as long as this likeness endures in charity and in
   virtues, so long also endures the union in rest. And this cannot be
   lost save only by mortal sin.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [60] By the "effective understanding" Ruysbroeck probably meant the
   faculty, sometimes called the "higher reason" or "pure intellect" which
   the Victorine mystics described as "beyond and beside reason," and
   whereby the mind contemplates intellectibilia: the "invisible things
   which may not be comprehended by human reason." Cf. Richard of St
   Victor, Benjamin Major, bk. i. caps. 6 and 7.

   [61] "Ghebrukelike gheneychtheit." This, one of Ruysbroeck's favourite
   terms, is generally translated "inclination"; but really includes the
   meaning--so characteristic of his doctrine--of a perceptual willed and
   active tending or drawing-nigh of the spirit to the enjoyment and
   possession of God: and instinctive effort of the soul to achieve its
   goal. It is the tendency immortalised in St Augustine's saying, "Thou
   hast made us for Thyself, and our heart can find no rest except in
   Thee." (Confessions, bk. i. cap. 7.)
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER LX

  SHOWING HOW WE HAVE NEED OF THE GRACE OF GOD, WHICH MAKES US LIKE UNTO GOD AND
  LEADS US TO GOD WITHOUT MEANS

   Now all holiness and all blessedness lie in this: that the spirit is
   led upwards, through likeness and by means of grace or glory, to rest
   in the essential unity. For the grace of God is the way by which we
   must always go, if we would enter into the naked essence in which God
   gives Himself with all His riches without means. And this is why the
   sinners and the damned spirits dwell in darkness; for they lack the
   grace of God, which should enlighten them, and lead them, and show them
   the way to the fruitive unity. Yet the essential being of the spirit is
   so noble, that even the damned cannot will their own annihilation. But
   sin builds up a barrier, and gives rise to such darkness and such
   unlikeness between the powers and the essence in which God lives, that
   the spirit cannot be united with its proper essence; which would be its
   own and its eternal rest, did sin not impede it. For whosoever lives
   without sin, he lives in likeness unto God, and in grace, and God is
   his own. And so we have need of grace, which casts out sin, and
   prepares the way, and makes our whole life fruitful. And this is why
   Christ always comes into us through means, that is, through grace and
   multifarious gifts; and we too go out towards Him through means, that
   is, through virtues and diverse practices. And the more inward gifts He
   gives and the more deeply He stirs us, the more inward and delightful
   are the workings of our spirit, as you have already heard in all the
   ways which have been shown forth before. And here there is a perpetual
   renewal; for God ever gives new gifts, and our spirit ever turns inward
   in such wise as it is invited and as is bestowed on it by God, and in
   that meeting it always receives a higher renewal. And thus one grows
   continually into a higher life. And this active meeting is altogether
   through means; for the gifts of God and our virtues and the activity of
   our spirit are the means. And these means are necessary for all men and
   all spirits: for, without the mediation of God's grace and a loving
   turning to Him in freedom, no creature shall ever be saved.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER LXI

  OF HOW GOD AND OUR SPIRIT VISIT EACH OTHER IN THE UNITY AND IN THE LIKENESS

   Now God sees the dwelling and the resting-place which He has made
   within us and through us; namely, the unity and the likeness. [62] And
   He wills to visit this unity without interruption, with a new coming of
   His most high birth and with a rich pouring forth of his fathomless
   love; for He wills to dwell in bliss within the loving spirit. And He
   wills to visit the likeness of our spirit with rich gifts, so that we
   become more like unto Him and more enlightened in the virtues. Now it
   is Christ's will that we should dwell and abide within the essential
   unity of our spirit, rich with Him above all creaturely works and above
   all virtues; and that we should dwell actively in that same unity, rich
   and fulfilled with virtues and heavenly gifts. And He wills that we
   shall visit that unity and that likeness without interruption, by means
   of every work which we do: for in every new "Now," God is born in us,
   and from this most high birth the Holy Ghost flows forth with all His
   gifts. Therefore we should go out to meet the gifts of God through the
   likeness; and the most high birth, through the unity.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [62] So Dionysius: "God-receptive minds, being the images of God, are
   the Divine abodes wherein above all God rests." (Celestial Hierarchy,
   cap. 7.)
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER LXII

  SHOWING HOW WE SHOULD GO OUT TO MEET GOD

   Now mark how, in each of our works, we shall go out to meet God, and
   shall increase our likeness unto Him, and shall more nobly possess the
   fruitive unity. By every good work, how small soever it be, which is
   directed to God with love and with an upright and single intention, we
   earn a greater likeness, and eternal life in God. A single intention
   draws together the scattered powers into the unity of the spirit, and
   joins the spirit to God. A single intention is end, and beginning, and
   adornment, of all virtues. A single intention offers to God praise and
   honour and all virtues: and it pierces and passes through itself, and
   all the heavens, and all things, and finds God within the simple ground
   of its own being. That intention is single which aims only at God and
   in all things only at their connection with God. The single intention
   casts out hypocrisy and duplicity, and a man must possess it and
   practise it in all his works above all other things; for it is this
   which keeps man in the presence of God, clear in understanding,
   diligent in virtue, and free from outward fear, both now and in the Day
   of Doom. Singleness of intention is the single eye of which Christ
   speaks, giving light to the whole body--that is, to the man's works and
   his whole life--and cleansing it of sin. Singleness of intention is the
   inward, enlightened, and loving tendency of the spirit; it is the
   foundation of all ghostliness; it includes in itself faith, hope, and
   charity, for it trusts in God and is faithful to Him. It casts nature
   underfoot, it establishes peace, it drives out ghostly discontent, and
   preserves fulness of life in all the virtues. And it gives peace and
   hope and boldness toward God, both now and in the Day of Doom.

   Thus we shall dwell in the unity of the spirit, in grace and in
   likeness; and shall always go out to meet God by means of the virtues,
   and offer up to Him with a simple intention our whole life and all our
   works; and thus in every work, and ever more and more, we shall
   increase our likeness. And thus we rise up out of the ground of our
   single intention, and pass through ourselves and go out to meet God
   without means, and rest in Him in the abyss of simplicity: there we
   possess that heritage which has been prepared for us from all eternity.
   All ghostly life and all works of virtue consist in the Divine likeness
   and in singleness of intention; and all their supreme rest consists in
   simplicity above all likeness. Nevertheless, one spirit surpasses
   another in virtue and in likeness, and each possess its own proper
   being in itself, according to the degree of its nobleness. And God
   suffices each one in particular, and each one, according to the measure
   of his love, seeks God in the ground of his spirit; both here and in
   eternity.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER LXIII

  OF THE ORDERING OF ALL THE VIRTUES THROUGH THE SEVEN GIFTS OF THE HOLY GHOST

   Now consider the order and the degrees of all the virtues and of all
   holiness, with which we should go out to meet God through resemblance;
   that so we may rest with Him in the unity.

  The Gift of Fear

   When a man lives in the Fear of God, in the moral virtues and in
   outward works; and when he is obedient and submissive to Holy Church
   and to the Divine commandments, and when he is ready and willing in
   simplicity of intention to do all good things: then he is like unto
   God, through faithfulness, and through the gathering of his will into
   the will of God, both in doing and in leaving undone. And he rests in
   God, above likeness; for through faithfulness and singleness of
   intention, he fulfils the will of God, more or less according to the
   measure of his likeness; and through love, he rests in his Beloved
   above likeness.

  The Gift of Piety

   And if he exerts himself well in that which he has received from God,
   then God bestows upon him the spirit of Piety and Mercy. Thus he
   becomes gentle of heart, meek and merciful. And thereby he becomes more
   full of life and more like to God, and feels himself to be resting more
   in God, and to be broader and deeper in virtue than before. And he
   savours this likeness and this rest so much the better, the more his
   resemblance is increased.

  The Gift of Knowledge

   And if he here exerts himself well, with great zeal, and with a single
   intention, and fights all that which is opposed to the virtues; this
   man receives the third gift, which is Knowledge and Discretion. Thus he
   becomes reasonable and discerning, and knows what to do and what to
   leave undone, and where he must give and where he must take away. And
   through simplicity of intention and godly love, this man rests in God
   above himself in the unity; and he possesses himself in likeness, and
   he possesses all his works with a greater delight, because he is
   obedient and submissive to the Father, and has reason and discernment
   through the Son, and is gentle and merciful through the Holy Ghost. And
   thus he bears a resemblance unto the Holy Trinity, and he rests in God,
   through his love and the simplicity of his intention. And herein the
   whole of the active life consists. Thus a man should exert himself with
   great zeal, and should follow his single intention with reason and
   discernment. And he must beware of all that is opposed to the virtues,
   and must ever bow himself down in humility at the feet of Christ: and
   in this way he will grow ever more and more in virtue and in
   resemblance; and if he keeps himself thus he cannot err. Yet according
   to this way, he still remains in the active life. For if a man
   practises and clings to the activities of the heart and the diversity
   of works, more than to the ground and reason of all works; and if he
   busies himself more with the practice of the sacraments, with their
   forms and outward symbols, than with the ground and the truth which are
   signified thereby: so he shall ever remain an outward man. But he shall
   be saved by his good works and his simplicity of intention.

  The Gift of Strength

   And therefore, if a man wishes to come nearer to God, and to exalt his
   practice and his life, he must proceed from the works to their reason,
   and from the forms to the truth; thereby he shall become master of his
   works, and shall know truth, and shall come into the inward life. And
   God gives him the fourth gift, which is the spirit of Strength: and
   thus he shall be able to overcome joy and grief, profit and loss, hope
   and care in earthly things, together with all kinds of hindrances and
   all multiplicity. And thus he becomes free and detached from all
   creatures. When a man has become free from all creaturely images, he is
   master of himself, and easily and without labour becomes inward and
   recollected; and turns freely and without hindrance to God, with
   fervent devotion, with lofty desire, with thanksgiving and praise, and
   with a single intention. Thus he enters into fruition of all his deeds
   and his whole life, inward and outward; for he stands before the throne
   of the Holy Trinity, and often receives inward consolation and
   sweetness from God. For he who serves at such a table with thanksgiving
   and praise, and with inward reverence, often drinks of the wine, and
   often eats of that which is left, and of the crumbs which fall from the
   Lord's table: and he continually possesses inward peace, through the
   singleness of his intention. And if he will abide steadfastly before
   God in thanksgiving and praise, and with uplifted purpose, the spirit
   of Strength is doubled within him; for then he no longer loses himself
   in bodily desires, in longings after consolation or sweetness, nor in
   any other gift of God, nor in rest and peace of the heart. But he will
   forego all gifts and every consolation, if so be that he may find Him
   Whom he loves. In this way he is strong who abandons and overcomes the
   unrest of the heart and earthly things; and doubly strong is he who
   also foregoes and overpasses every consolation and heavenly gift. Thus
   a man transcends all creatures, and possesses himself, powerful and
   free, through the gift of spiritual Strength.

  The gift of counsel

   When, therefore, no creature can either overcome or impede a man from
   persisting in his single and upward-striving intention, and when
   through this Strength he is steadfast in praising God, seeking and
   meaning God above all His gifts, then God bestows upon him the fifth
   gift, which is the gift of Counsel In this gift the Father draws the
   man inwardly, and calls him to His right hand, with the chosen in His
   unity. And the Son says in ghostly wise within him: Follow Me to My
   Father: one thing is needful." And the Holy Ghost makes the heart
   expand and flame up in fiery love. And thence comes the life of loving
   tumult and inward restlessness; for, in him who listens to this
   counsel, there arises a storm of love, and nothing can satisfy him save
   God alone. And therefore he abandons himself and all things, that he
   may find Him in Whom he lives and in Whom all things are one. Here the
   man should have God in mind in a simple way, and should master himself
   by means of the reason, and should renounce all self-will, and should
   await in freedom the unity which he desires, until the day when it is
   God's pleasure to give it. Thus the spirit of Counsel works in him in
   two ways: for that man is great, and follows the precept and counsel of
   God, who abandons himself and all things, and says, with an insatiable,
   impetuous and burning love: Thy Kingdom come. But that man is greater
   still, and follows still better the counsel of God, who overcomes his
   own self-will, and renounces it in love, and says unto God with
   reverent submission: Thy Will be done in all things and not my will.
   When Christ our dear Lord approached His passion, He said those very
   words unto His Father, in humble abnegation of Himself; and they were
   to Him the most happy, and to us the most wholesome, and to the Father
   the most lovable, and to the devil the most terrible, words which
   Christ ever spoke; for, by His renunciation of self-will according to
   His manhood, we are all saved. In this way the will of God now becomes
   to the loving and humble man the highest joy, and the greatest desire
   of his ghostly feelings: even though this will should lead him to hell,
   which is impossible. And here nature is cast down into the depths, and
   God is exalted most highly; and this man becomes capable of receiving
   all the gifts of God; for he has denied himself, and has renounced his
   own self, and has given all for all. And he therefore asks nothing and
   wills nothing but that which God wishes to give him. That which God
   wills, this is his joy; and he who surrenders himself to God in love is
   the most free of all men living. He lives without care, for God cannot
   lose that which is His.

   Now mark this: although God knows all hearts, yet such a man is often
   tempted and tried of Him, whether he is able to renounce himself in
   freedom: and by this, he may then become enlightened, and may live for
   the glory of God and also for his own salvation. And that is why God
   sometimes takes him from His right hand to His left, from heaven into
   hell, from all blessedness into great misery; so that it seems to him
   as though he were forsaken and despised of God and of all creatures.
   If, then, he has formerly renounced himself and his own will in love
   and in joy, so that he sought not himself but the good pleasure of God,
   he will easily renounce himself also in pains and misery, so that in
   these too he will seek not himself but always the glory of God. He who
   is willing to work great things is willing also to suffer great things;
   but to bear and to suffer in resignation is nobler and more pleasing to
   God, and more satisfying to our spirit, than to work great things in a
   like resignation, for it is more contrary to our nature. And this is
   why our spirit is more exalted and our nature more cast down by
   grievous suffering than by great works done with equal love. When a man
   maintains himself in this resignation, without any other preference,
   right as one who neither wills nor knows anything else, then he
   possesses the spirit of Counsel in two ways; for he satisfies the will
   and the counsel of God in his working and his suffering, by
   self-surrender, and by submissive obedience. And his nature is adorned
   most gloriously: and he is capable of being enlightened according to

  The Gift of Understanding

   And therefore God gives him the sixth gift, which is the spirit of
   Understanding. This gift we have already likened to a fountain with
   three rills, for it establishes our spirit in the unity, it reveals
   Truth and it brings forth a wide and general love. This gift may also
   be likened to sunshine, for by its shining the sun fills the air with a
   simple brightness and lights all forms, and shows the distinctions of
   all colours. And thereby it shows forth its own power; and its heat is
   common to the whole world, bringing forth fruits and useful things. So
   likewise does the first ray of this gift bring about simplicity within
   the spirit. And this simplicity is penetrated by a particular radiance
   even as the air of the heavens by the splendour of the sun. For the
   grace of God, which is the ground of all gifts, maintains itself
   essentially like to a simple light in our potential understanding: and,
   by means of this simple light our spirit is made stable and onefold and
   enlightened, and fulfilled of grace and Divine gifts: and here it is
   like unto God through grace and Divine love. And since the spirit is
   now like unto God, and means and loves God alone above all gifts, it
   will no longer be satisfied by likeness, nor by a created brightness;
   for it has both by nature and above nature a primal tendency towards
   the Abysmal Being from which it has flowed forth. And the Unity of the
   Divine Being eternally draws back all likeness into its unity. And here
   the spirit is enkindled into fruition, and it melts into God as into
   its eternal rest; for the grace of God is to God even as the sunshine
   is to the sun, and the grace of God is the means and the way which
   leads us to God. And for this reason it shines within us in simplicity,
   and makes us deiform, that is, like unto God. And this likeness
   perpetually merges itself in God, and dies in God, and becomes one with
   God, and remains one, for charity makes us one with God, and causes us
   to remain one and to dwell in the One. Nevertheless we keep the eternal
   likeness in the light of grace or of glory; thereby we possess
   ourselves actively in charity and in the virtues. And we keep the union
   with God, above our activity, in the nakedness of our spirit, in the
   Divine light, where we possess God in rest, above all virtues. For
   charity in the likeness must ever be at work; and union with God in
   fruitive love must ever be at rest. And this is the working of love;
   for in one "Now" and at the same time love works and rests in its
   Beloved. And the one is strengthened by the other; for the higher the
   love, the greater the rest; and the greater the rest, the deeper the
   love; for the one lives in the other, and whosoever loves not, rests
   not, and whosoever rests not, loves not. And yet, some good men think
   that they neither love nor rest in God; and this thought itself comes
   from love. Because they desire to love more than they can, it seems to
   them that their love falls short. And yet in this work they taste love
   and rest; for none save the resigned, emptied and enlightened man can
   understand how one may love in labour and rest in fruition. Yet every
   lover is one with God in rest, and like unto God in the works of love;
   for God in His most high nature, of which we bear the likeness, dwells
   in fruition in eternal rest according to His Essential Unity, but works
   in eternal activity according to the Trinity: and the one is the
   perfection of the other; for rest abides in the Unity, and work in the
   Trinity. And thus they dwell together throughout eternity. And,
   therefore, if a man is to taste of God, he must love and if he will
   love, then he may taste. But if he lets himself be satisfied with other
   things, he shall not be able to taste what God is. And therefore we
   must possess ourselves in simplicity, in virtue, and in likeness, and
   God above ourselves through love in rest and unity. And this is the
   first way in which the man who is common to all is made stable.

   When the air is fulfilled with the brightness of the sun, the beauty
   and the wealth of the whole world are revealed, and the eyes of men
   become enlightened and rejoice in the manifold diversity of colours.
   And so it is, when we are onefold within ourselves, and our power of
   understanding is enlightened and the Spirit of Understanding shines
   through it. Then we can become aware of the high attributes which are
   in God, and which are the causes of all the works which flow forth from
   Him. Although all men may understand the works, and God through His
   works; yet no one can truly understand, neither in their appearance nor
   in their reality, the attributes of the works of God as they are in
   their ground, save by means of this gift. For this teaches us to seek
   out and to recognise our own nobleness, and it gives us the power to
   discern the virtues and all practices, and the way in which we should
   live without error in accordance with eternal Truth: and he who is
   enlightened by it can dwell in the spirit, and can, with enlightened
   reason, rightly apprehend and understand all things in heaven and on
   earth. And therefore such a one walks in heaven, and beholds and
   apprehends with all saints the nobility of his Beloved, His
   incomprehensible height, His abysmal depth, length and breadth, wisdom
   and truth, His bounty and His unspeakable generosity, and all those
   loveworthy attributes which are in God our Lover without number, and
   without limit in His most high nature: for all this is He Himself. Then
   that enlightened man lowers his eyes, and beholds himself and all other
   men and all creatures, and observes how God in His free generosity has
   created them in nature and endowed them in many ways, and how, above
   nature, it is His pleasure to endow them and to enrich them with
   Himself, if they will but seek and desire Him. All such reasoning
   observation of the manifold diversities of the Divine riches rejoices
   our spirit, if, through Divine love, we have died unto ourselves in
   God, and if we live and walk in the spirit, and taste of the things
   which are eternal. This gift of Understanding shows us the unity which
   we possess in God through the fruitive immersion of love, and also the
   likeness to God which we have in ourselves through charity and the
   works of virtue. And it gives to us light and brightness in which we
   can walk with discernment in the ways of the spirit, and can seek out
   and recognise God in ghostly similitudes, and also ourselves, and all
   things according to the mode and the measure of that light and
   according to the will of God and the greater nobility of our
   understanding. This is the second degree in which the man who is common
   to all may be enlightened.

   According to the measure in which the air is irradiated by the
   brightness of the sun, so too the heat increases and brings all things
   to fruitfulness. When our reason and understanding are so enlightened,
   that they can recognise and distinguish Divine truth, then the will,
   that is, the power of love, grows hotter and streams forth in abundant
   loyalty and love towards all men in common. For this gift, through the
   knowledge of truth which is imparted to us in its light, establishes in
   us a wide-stretching love toward all in common. Now the most simple are
   also the most tranquil, and have the most peace in themselves; and are
   the most deeply immersed in God; and are most enlightened in
   understanding, and most fruitful in good works, and in outflowing love
   toward all in common. And they are hindered least, for they are most
   like unto God; for God is simplicity in His Being, clarity in His
   understanding, and outflowing and universal love in His works. And the
   more we are like unto God in these three things, so much the more
   closely are we united with Him. And for this reason we must remain
   simple in our ground, and must apprehend all things by means of
   enlightened reason, and must flow forth through all things in universal
   love. So likewise the sun in the heavens, though it abides in itself
   simple and unchanged, sends forth its light and heat to the whole world
   in common.

   Now understand how we should live with enlightened reason in universal
   love. The Father is the Origin of the whole Godhead according to
   Essence and according to Personality. We therefore should bow down in
   spirit, in humble awe, before the sublimity of the Father: and thereby
   we possess humility, the foundation of all the virtues. We should
   fervently adore, that is to say, we should honour and reverence, the
   mightiness of the Father, because He, in His might, creates and
   preserves all things out of nothing. And thereby we shall be lifted up
   in ghostly wise. We should offer praise and thanks and everlasting
   service to the faithfulness and love of God, Who has freed us from the
   fetters of the enemy and from eternal death: and thereby we shall be
   made free. We should present and bewail before the wisdom of God the
   blindness and ignorance of human nature; and should crave that all men
   may become enlightened, and may attain to the knowledge of truth: thus
   God shall be known and honoured by them. We should pray for the mercy
   of God upon sinners, that thus they may be converted, and may grow in
   virtue: thus God shall be loved by them with a desirous love. We should
   give generously to all those who have need of it of the rich treasures
   of God, that therewith they may all be filled, and may flow back
   towards God; and thus God shall be possessed by them all. We should
   offer to the Father, with awe and reverence, all the service and all
   the works which Christ, according to His manhood, fulfilled in love:
   thus all our prayers shall be heard. We should also offer to the Father
   in Christ Jesus all the fervent devotion of the angels and the saints
   and the just: so we shall be united with them all in the glory of Godly
   We should also offer up to the Father the whole service of Holy Church,
   and the Holy Sacrifice of all the priests, and all that we may achieve
   and think, in the name of Christ; that thereby we may go out to meet
   God through Christ, and may become like unto Him in universal love, and
   may transcend all likeness in simplicity, and may be united with Him
   within the Essential Unity. We should ever abide in oneness with God,
   and should eternally flow forth with God and all His saints in
   universal love, and continually return with thankfulness and praise,
   and immerse ourselves in fruitive love in the Essential Rest. This is
   the richest life of which I know: and in it we possess the gift of
   Understanding.

  The Gift of Wisdom

   Now understand this well: when we turn within ourselves in
   contemplation, the fruitive unity of God is like to a darkness, a
   somewhat which is unconditioned and incomprehensible. And the spirit
   turns inward through love and through simplicity of intention, because
   it is active in all virtues, offering itself up in fruition above all
   virtues. In this loving introversion, there arises the seventh gift,
   which is the spirit of Savouring Wisdom; [63] and it saturates the
   simplicity of our spirit, soul and body, with wisdom and with ghostly
   savours. And it is a ghostly touch or stirring within the unity of our
   spirit; and it is an inpouring and a source of all grace, all gifts and
   all virtues. And, in this touch of God, each man savours his exercise
   and his life according to the power of the touch and the measure of his
   love. And this Divine stirring is the inmost mediator between God and
   ourselves, between rest and activity, between the conditioned and the
   unconditioned, between eternity and time. And God works this ghostly
   touching within us first of all, before all gifts; and yet it is known
   and tasted by us last of all. For only when we have lovingly sought God
   in all our practices even to the inward deeps of our ground, do we
   first feel the gushing in of all the graces and gifts of God; and we
   feel this touch in the unity of our highest powers, above reason, but
   not without reason, for we understand in truth that we are touched. But
   if we would know what this is and whence it comes, then reason and all
   creaturely observation fail. For though the air be illuminated by the
   sunlight, and the eyes be sharp and sound, if one would follow the rays
   which bring the brightness, and look at the disc of the sun, the eyes
   would fail in their activity, and would only receive the lustre of the
   rays in a passive way. So likewise, the reflection of the
   Incomprehensible Light in the unity of our highest power is so intense
   that all creaturely activity which works in distinction must fail. And
   here our activity must passively endure the interior working of God,
   which is the source of all Divine gifts. For could we receive God
   Himself into our comprehension, He would give Himself to us without
   intermediary; but this is impossible to us because we are too narrow
   and too little to comprehend God. And therefore He pours His gifts into
   us according to the measure of our comprehension and the worthiness of
   our practices. For the fruitful unity of God ever abides above the
   unity of our powers and ever demands of us likeness in love and in
   virtues. And that is why we are touched again and again, that we may
   each time be renewed and become more like Him in the virtues. And,
   through these renewed touches, the spirit falls into hunger and thirst,
   and would taste through and through, and pass through and through the
   whole abyss in a storm of love, that thereby it may be satisfied. Hence
   there comes an eternal, hungry craving, and an eternal unsatisfied
   desire. For all loving spirits desire and strive after God, each
   according to its nobleness and the measure in which it has been touched
   by God; yet God remains eternally incomprehensible by way of our active
   desires, and therefore there abides in us, together with all saints, an
   eternal hunger, and an eternal desirous introversion. And in the
   meeting with God, the radiance and the heat are so great and so
   limitless that all spirits must fail in their activity, and must melt
   and vanish away in sensible love in the unity of their spirit. And here
   they must passively endure as sheer creatures the working of God. And
   here our spirit and Divine grace and all our virtues are one sensible
   love without activity; for our spirit has spent itself and has itself
   become love. And here the spirit is simple and susceptible of all gifts
   and is capable of every virtue. And, in this ground of sensible love,
   there dwells the gushing spring, that is, the inpouring or inward
   working of God, which at every hour moves us and urges us and draws us
   inward and causes us to flow forth into new works of virtue. Thus I
   have shown to you the ground and the condition of all the virtues.

CHAPTER LXIV

  OF THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF THE MOST INTERIOR LIFE

   Now understand this well: that measureless Splendour of God, which
   together with the incomprehensible brightness, is the cause of all
   gifts and of all virtues--that same Uncomprehended Light transfigures
   the fruitive tendency of our spirit and penetrates it in a way that is
   wayless; that is, through the Uncomprehended Light. And in this light
   the spirit immerses itself in fruitive rest; for this rest is wayless
   and fathomless, and one can know of it in no other way than through
   itself--that is, through rest. For, could we know and comprehend it, it
   would fall into mode and measure; then it could not satisfy us, but
   rest would become an eternal restlessness. And for this reason, the
   simple, loving and immersed tendency of our spirit works within us a
   fruitive love; and this fruitive love is abysmal. And the abyss of God
   calls to the abyss; that is, of all those who are united with the
   Spirit of God in fruitive love. This inward call is an inundation of
   the essential brightness, and this essential brightness, enfolding us
   in an abysmal love, causes us to be lost to ourselves, and to flow
   forth from ourselves into the wild darkness of the Godhead. And, thus
   united without means, and made one with the Spirit of God, we can meet
   God through God, and everlastingly possess with Him and in Him our
   eternal bliss.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER LXV

  OF THREE KINDS OF MOST INWARD PRACTICES

   This most inward life is practised in three ways.

   At times, the inward man performs his introspection simply, according
   to the fruitive tendency, above all activity and above all virtues,
   through a simple inward gazing in the fruition of love. And here he
   meets God without intermediary. And from out the Divine Unity, there
   shines into him a simple light and this light shows him Darkness and
   Nakedness and Nothingness. [64] In the Darkness, he is enwrapped and
   falls into somewhat which is in no wise, even as one who has lost his
   way. In the Nakedness, he loses the perception and discernment of all
   things, and is transfigured and penetrated by a simple light. In the
   Nothingness, all his activity fails him, for he is vanquished by the
   working of God's abysmal love, and in the fruitive inclination of his
   spirit he vanquishes God, and becomes one spirit with him. And in this
   oneness with the Spirit of God, he enters into a fruitive tasting and
   possesses the Being of God. And he is filled, according to the measure
   in which he has sunk himself in his essential being with the abysmal
   delights and riches of God. And from these riches an envelopment and a
   plenitude of sensible love flow forth into the unity of the higher
   powers. And from this plenitude of sensible love, a savoury and
   penetrating satisfaction flows forth into the heart and the bodily
   powers. And through this inflow the man becomes immovable within, and
   helpless as regards himself and all his works. And in the deeps of his
   ground he knows and feels nothing, in soul or in body, but a singular
   radiance with a sensible well-being and an all-pervading saviour. This
   is the first way, and it is the way of emptiness; for it makes a man
   empty of all things, and lifts him up above activity and above all the
   virtues. And it unites the man with God, and brings about a firm
   perseverance in the most interior practices which he can cultivate.
   When, however, any restlessness, or working of the virtues, puts
   intermediaries, or images, between the inward man and the naked
   introversion which he desires, then he is hindered in this exercise;
   for this way consists in a going out, beyond all things, into the
   Emptiness. This is the first form of the most inward exercise.

   At times such an inward man turns towards God with ardent desire and
   activity; that he may glorify and honour Him, and offer up and
   annihilate in the love of God, his selfhood and all that he is able to
   do. And here he meets God through an intermediary. This intermediary is
   the gift of Savouring Wisdom, the ground and origin of all virtues;
   which enkindles and moves all good men according to the measure of
   their love, and at times so greatly stirs and enkindles the inward man
   through love, that all the gifts of God, and all that God may give,
   except the gift of Himself, seem too little to him, and cannot satisfy
   him, but rather increase his impatience. For he has an inward
   perception or feeling in his ground; where all the virtues begin and
   end, where love dwells, and where with ardent desire he offers up all
   his virtues to God. And here the hunger and thirst of love become so
   great that he perpetually surrenders himself, and gives up his own
   works, and empties himself, and is noughted in love, for he is hungry
   and thirsty for the taste of God; and, at each irradiation of God, [65]
   he is seized by God, and more than ever before is newly touched by
   love. Living he dies, and dying he lives again. And in this way the
   desirous hunger and thirst of love are renewed in him every hour.

   This is the second way, which is the way of longing, in which love
   dwells in the Divine likeness, and longs and craves to unite itself
   with God. This way is more profitable and honourable to us than the
   first, for it is the source of the first; for none can enter into the
   rest which is above all works save the man who has loved love with
   desire and with activity. And this is why the grace of God and our
   active love must both go before and follow after; that is to say, they
   must be practised both before and after. For without acts of love we
   cannot merit anything, neither achieve God, nor keep the possession of
   that which we have acquired through the works of love. And for this
   reason no one who has power over himself, and can practise love, should
   be idle. When, however, a good man lingers in any gift of God, or any
   creature, he will be hindered in this most inward exercise; for this
   exercise is a hunger which nothing can still, save God alone.

   From these two ways the third way arises; and this is an inward life
   according to justice. Now understand this: God comes to us without
   ceasing both with means and without means, and demands of us both
   action and fruition, in such a way that the one never impedes, but
   always strengthens, the other. And therefore the most inward man lives
   his life in these two ways: namely, in work and in rest. [66] And in
   each he is whole and undivided; for he is wholly in God because he
   rests in fruition, and he is wholly in himself because he loves in
   activity: and he is perpetually called and urged by God to renew both
   the rest and the work. And the justice of the spirit desires to pay
   every hour that which is demanded of it by God. And therefore, at each
   irradiation of God, the spirit turns inward, in action and in fruition;
   and thus it is renewed in every virtue, and is more deeply immersed in
   fruitive rest. For God gives, in one gift, Himself and His gifts; and
   the spirit gives, at each introversion, itself and all its works. For
   by means of the simple irradiation of God and the fruitive tendency and
   melting away of love, the spirit has been united with God, and is
   incessantly transported into rest. And through the gifts of
   Understanding and Savouring Wisdom, it is touched in an active way, and
   perpetually enlightened and enkindled in love. And there is shown and
   presented to it in the spirit all that one may desire. It is hungry and
   thirsty, for it beholds the food of the angels and the heavenly drink.
   It works diligently in love, for it beholds its rest. It is a pilgrim;
   and it sees its country. In love it strives for victory; for it sees
   its crown. Consolation, peace, joy, beauty and riches, and all that can
   delight it, are shown without measure in ghostly images to the reason
   which is enlightened in God. And through this showing and the touch of
   God, love remains active. For this just man has established a true life
   in the spirit, in rest and in work, which shall endure eternally; but,
   after this life, it shall be changed into a higher state. Thus the man
   is just; and he goes towards God with fervent love in eternal activity;
   and he goes in God with fruitive inclination in eternal rest. And he
   dwells in God, and yet goes forth towards all creatures in universal
   love, in virtue, and in justice. And this is the supreme summit of the
   inward life. All those men who do not possess both rest and work in one
   and the same exercise, have not yet attained this justice. This just
   man cannot be hindered in his introversion, for he turns inward both in
   fruition and in work; but he is like to a double mirror, which receives
   images on both sides. For in his higher part, the man receives God with
   all His gifts; and, in his lower part, he receives bodily images
   through the senses. Now he can enter into himself at will, and can
   practise justice without hindrance. But man is unstable in this life,
   and that is why he often turns outwards, and works in the senses,
   without need and without the command of the enlightened reason; and
   thus he falls into venial sins. But in the loving introversion of the
   just man all venial sins are like to drops of water in a glowing
   furnace.

   And with this I leave the inward life.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [64] This is that "contemplation in caligine" celebrated by all
   Christian mystics of the Dionysian tradition. It introduces
   consciousness into a universe which seems dark, bare, and nought to the
   intellect, because it transcends all the conceptions with which that
   intellect is able to deal; being indeed "dark with excess of light."
   Thus Dionysius says: "We pray that we may enter the Radiant Darkness,
   and through blindness and ignorance may see and know that this
   blindness and ignorance is itself above sight and knowledge" (Mystic
   Theology, cap. 1); and again, "The Divine Dark is the inaccessible
   Light in which God is said to dwell. Into this dark, invisible because
   of its surpassing brightness and unsearchable because of the abundance
   of its supernatural torrents of light, all enter who are deemed worthy
   to know and see God: and by the very fact of not seeing or knowing, are
   truly in Him Who is above all sight and knowledge." (Letter to Dorothy
   the Deacon.) So, too, the author of The Cloud of Unknowing--"Let be
   this everywhere and this aught, in comparison of this nowhere and this
   nought. Reck thee never if thy wits cannot reason of this nought; for
   surely I love it much the better. It is so worthy a thing in itself
   that they cannot reason thereupon. this nought may better be felt than
   seen: for it is full blind and full dark to them that have but little
   while looked thereupon. Nevertheless, if I shall soothlier say, a soul
   is more blinded in feeling of it for abundance of ghostly light, than
   for any darkness or wanting of bodily light." (The Cloud of Unknowing,
   cap. 68.)

   [65] The Flemish "inblicke Gods" suggests the sudden flashing glance of
   Divine enlightenment: keen, vivid, but transitory, like lightning in
   the sky.

   [66] This conception of the dual life which man possesses in the
   likeness of God appears to be derived from Dionysius, who says: "That
   which is established above both every rest and every movement, and
   moves each thing according to the law of its own being in its own
   movement, is both the Rest and the Movement of all." (Divine Names,
   cap. 1.)

CHAPTER LXVI

  SHOWING HOW SOME MEN LIVE CONTRARY TO THESE EXERCISES

   Now some men, who seem to be righteous, yet live contrary to these
   three ways and to every virtue. Let every one observe and prove
   himself! Every man who is not drawn and enlightened of God is not
   touched by love, and has neither the active cleaving with desire [67]
   nor the simple and loving tendency to fruitive rest. And therefore such
   a one cannot unite himself with God; for all those who live without
   supernatural love are inclined towards themselves and seek their rest
   in outward things. For all creatures by their nature tend towards rest:
   and therefore, rest is sought both by the good and by the evil, in
   divers ways.

   Now mark this: when a man is bare and imageless in his senses, and
   empty and idle in his higher powers, [68] he enters into rest through
   mere nature; and this rest may be found and possessed within themselves
   in mere nature by all creatures, without the grace of God, whenever
   they can strip themselves of images and of all activity. But in this
   the loving man cannot find his rest, for charity and the inward touch
   of God's grace will not be still: and so the inward man cannot long
   remain in natural rest within himself.

   But now mark the way in which this natural rest is practised. It is a
   sitting still, without either outward or inward acts, in vacancy, in
   order that rest may be found and may remain untroubled. But a rest
   which is practised in this way is unlawful; for it brings with it in
   men a blindness and ignorance, and a sinking down into themselves
   without activity. Such a rest is nought else than an idleness, into
   which the man has fallen, and in which he forgets himself and God and
   all things in all that has to do with activity. This rest is wholly
   contrary to the supernatural rest, which one possesses in God; for that
   is a loving self-mergence joined to a simple gazing into the
   Incomprehensible Brightness. This rest in God, which is actively sought
   with inward longing, and is found in fruitive inclination, and is
   eternally possessed in the self-mergence of love, and which, when
   possessed, is sought none the less: this rest is exalted above the rest
   of mere nature as greatly as God is exalted above all creatures. And
   that is why all those men are deceived who have self in mind and sink
   down in the natural rest, and neither seek God in desire, nor find Him
   in fruitive love; for the rest which they find consists in their own
   idleness, to which they are inclined by nature and by habit. And in
   this natural rest one cannot find God, but it certainly leads a man
   into a bare vacancy, which may be found by Pagans and Jews and all men,
   how wicked soever they may be, if they can live in their sins without
   the reproach of their conscience, and can empty themselves of every
   image and of all activity. In this bare vacancy the rest is pleasant
   and great. This rest is in itself no sin; for it exists in all men by
   nature, whenever they make themselves empty. But when a man wishes to
   practise and possess it without acts of virtue, he falls into spiritual
   pride and a self-complacency, from which he seldom recovers. And he
   sometimes fancies himself to have and to be that to which he shall
   never attain. When a man thus possesses this rest in false quietude,
   and all loving adherence seems a hindrance to him, he clings to himself
   in his rest, and lives contrary to the first way in which man is united
   with God: and this is the beginning of all ghostly error.

   Now consider a similitude of this: the angels who turned inward towards
   God in love and fruition, with all that they had received from Him,
   found beatitude and eternal rest; but those who turned towards
   themselves, and sought rest in themselves with self-complacency in the
   natural light, their rest was short and was unlawful. And they were
   blinded, and there was a wall of separation between them and the
   external light, and they fell into darkness and eternal restlessness.
   This is the first contrary way; which one possesses by resting in false
   quietude.

   Now mark this: when a man wishes to possess inward rest in idleness,
   without inward and desirous cleaving to God, then he is ready for all
   errors; for he is turned away from God, and inclined towards himself,
   in natural love, seeking and desiring consolation and sweetness and
   everything that pleases him. And such a man is like to a merchant, for
   in all his activity he is turned only towards himself, and seeks and
   means his own rest and his own profit, more than the glory of God. A
   man who thus lives in mere natural love, always possesses himself in
   self-love without self-renunciation. Such men often lead a hard life
   with great works of penitence, that they may become known and renowned
   for their great sanctity, and also that they may merit a great reward;
   for all natural love is favourably disposed to itself and likes to
   receive great honours in time and a great reward in eternity. And these
   men have many special desires, and pray and beseech God for many
   particular things. And thus they are often deceived; for sometimes,
   through the work of the devil, those things which they desire happen to
   them, and then they ascribe this to their sanctity, and hold themselves
   worthy of them all; for such people are proud, and neither touched nor
   enlightened by God. And therefore they dwell within themselves, and a
   small consolation may greatly rejoice them, for they know not what they
   lack. And they are wholly attached, in their desire, to inward savours
   and the spiritual refreshment of their nature. And this is called
   spiritual lust; for it is an inordinate attachment in natural love,
   which is always directed towards itself, and seeks its own profit in
   all things.

   Such men are always spiritually proud and self-willed; and this is why
   their desires and lusts are sometimes so vehemently set upon the things
   which they desire, and wilfully strive to acquire from God, so that
   they are often deceived, and some of them also become possessed by the
   devil. All these men live contrary to charity and to the loving
   introversion in which a man offers himself up, with all that he can
   achieve, for the honour and love of God; and in which nothing can give
   him rest or satisfaction but a single incomprehensible Good, which is
   God alone. For charity is a bond of love, in which we are drawn up to
   God, and through which we renounce ourselves, and whereby we are united
   with God and God is united with us. But natural love turns back towards
   itself, and towards its own profit, and ever abides alone.
   Nevertheless, in its outward works, natural love is as like unto
   charity as two hairs from the same head; but the intentions are
   different. For the good man always seeks and means and desires, with an
   aspiring heart, to glorify God; but in natural love a man has always
   himself and his own profit in mind. Therefore, when natural love
   opposes and conquers true charity the man falls into four sins; namely,
   spiritual pride, avarice, gluttony, and lust. And in this way Adam fell
   in Paradise, and all human nature with him, for he loved himself
   inordinately with natural love, and so he turned away from God, and
   scorned in his pride the commandment of God. And he desired knowledge
   and wisdom in his avarice; and he sought pleasant tastes and
   satisfactions in gluttony; and after that he was moved by lust. But
   Mary was a living Paradise. She found the grace which Adam lost, and
   much more besides, for she is the Mother of Love. She turned in active
   charity towards God, and conceived Christ in humility. And she offered
   Him up to the Father with all His sufferings in generosity; and she
   never tasted of consolation, nor of any gift, in gluttony; and her
   whole life was in purity. Whosoever follows her shall conquer all that
   is contrary to the virtues, and shall enter into the kingdom where she
   reigns with her Son in eternity.

   So, when a man possesses the natural rest in bare vacancy, whilst in
   all his works he has himself in mind, and he continues obstinately
   disobedient in his self-will, he cannot be united with God; for he
   lives without charity in unlikeness to God. And here begins the third
   contrary way, which is the most noxious of all; and this is an
   unrighteous life, full of ghostly error and of all perversity.

   Now mark well what follows, lest you should not understand it well. All
   these men are, in their own opinion, God-seeing men, and believe
   themselves the holiest of all men living. Yet they live contrary and
   unlike to God and all saints and all good men. Observe the following
   marks: thus you will be able to recognise them both by their words and
   their works. By means of the natural rest which they feel and possess
   in themselves in bare vacancy, they believe themselves to be free, and
   to be united with God without means, and to be above all the customs of
   Holy Church, and above the commandments of God, and above the law, and
   above every work of virtue which can in any way be done. For they think
   their idleness to be so great a thing that it may not be troubled by
   any work, how good soever it be; for this idleness is nobler than any
   virtue. And therefore they maintain themselves in pure passivity,
   without any activity towards above or towards below; like a loom, which
   does not work of itself, but awaits its master, and the time when he
   wishes to work. For they deem that if they worked themselves, God would
   be hindered in His work. And therefore they are empty of every virtue;
   and indeed so empty, that they will neither praise nor thank God. They
   have no knowledge and no love, no will, no prayer, no desire; for they
   believe that all that they could pray for, and desire, is already
   possessed of them. And so they are poor of spirit, for they are without
   will, and have forsaken everything, and live without any personal
   preferences: and thus it seems to them that they are empty, and have
   overcome everything, and have in their possession all those things for
   which the customs of Holy Church have been instituted and ordained. And
   so, they say, no one, not even God, can give them anything, or can take
   away anything from them; for they have, in their own opinion,
   transcended all customs and all virtues, and have entered into the pure
   emptiness, and are released from every virtue. And this release from
   all virtues in emptiness needs, they say, more labour than the
   acquisition of the virtues. And therefore they would be free, and
   obedient to none; neither pope, nor bishop, nor parson. Even though
   outwardly they seem to be so, inwardly they are submissive to none,
   neither in will nor in works; for they are in every respect empty of
   all that Holy Church practises. And therefore they say, as long as a
   man strives after virtue, and desires to fulfil the good pleasure of
   God, he is still imperfect; for he is still amassing virtues, and knows
   not this spiritual poverty and emptiness. But they are themselves, in
   their own opinion, lifted up above all the choirs of saints and angels,
   and above every reward which one can in any way merit. And therefore
   they say that their virtues can nevermore increase, nor can they
   themselves deserve a greater reward, nor commit any sin any more; for,
   they say, they live without will, and have surrendered their spirit to
   God in rest and bareness, and are one with God, and in themselves have
   become nothing. And therefore they can do without hindrance all that
   the bodily nature desires, for they have attained to the state of
   innocence, and no law has sway over them. When therefore it happens
   that their emptiness of spirit is troubled or hindered by any natural
   lust, they yield to nature, that their emptiness of spirit may remain
   untroubled. And that is why they do not keep Lent or Ember-days, or any
   other commandment, save when they do it for the sake of their
   neighbours; for they live without conscience in all things. I hope that
   of such folk not many are to be found; but those who are like them are
   the most wicked and vile of all men living. And they are sometimes
   possessed of the Fiend; and then they are so cunning that one cannot
   vanquish them on the grounds of reason. But through Holy Scripture and
   the teaching of Christ and our Faith, we may prove that they are
   deceived.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [67] This adherence or deliberate cleaving of the loving will to God is
   the supreme work of the self in the Divine union and is never
   transcended. Its absence marks the distinction between heretical
   quietism and true contemplation.

   [68] Ruysbroeck's word "ledich" means both empty and idle: a blank
   passivity of the mind and of the will.

CHAPTER LXVII

  OF ANOTHER KIND OF PERVERTED MEN

   Now we find yet another kind of perverted men, who are in some points
   different from those already described; though they too believe
   themselves to be exempted from all works, and to be instruments with
   which God works what He wills. And therefore they say that they are in
   a purely passive state without activity; and that the works which God
   works through them are noble and meritorious beyond anything that
   another man, working his works himself by the grace of God, could do.
   And therefore they say that they are God-passive men, [69] and that
   they do nothing of themselves, but that God works all their works. And
   they say they can do no sin: for it is God Who does all their works,
   and in themselves they are empty of all things. And all that God wills
   is worked through them, and nothing else. These men have surrendered
   themselves to inward passivity in their emptiness; and live without
   preference for any one thing. And they have a resigned and humble
   appearance, and can very well endure and suffer with equanimity all
   that befalls them; for they hold themselves to be the instruments with
   which God works according to His will. Such men in many of their ways
   and works are like in their conduct to good men, but in some things
   they differ from them; for all things to which they are inwardly urged,
   whether these be virtuous or not, they believe to proceed from the Holy
   Ghost. And in this and in suchlike things, they are deceived; for the
   Spirit of God neither wills, counsels, nor works, in any man things
   which are contrary to the teaching of Christ and Holy Christianity.

   Such folk are hard to recognise, save by the man who is enlightened,
   and has received the power of discerning spirits and divine truth; for
   many amongst them are cunning in outward things and know well how to
   cloak and make fair their perversity. And they are so self-willed, and
   hold so fast to their own peculiar ideas, that they would sooner die
   than abandon one point of the thing they have laid hold on; for they
   hold themselves the holiest and most enlightened of all men living.

   These men differ from the first kind in this, that they say that they
   can grow and acquire merit: whereas the others hold that they cannot
   merit anything more, for they possess themselves in unity and
   emptiness, wherefrom one cannot rise higher, because here there is no
   more activity. These are all perverted men, and are the most wicked of
   the living; and they are to be abhorred as if they were the Fiend in
   hell. But if you have well understood that teaching which I have given
   you heretofore in various ways, you will perceive that these men are
   deceived. For they live contrary to God and righteousness and all
   saints; and they are all precursors of the Antichrist, preparing his
   way in every unbelief. For they would be free, without the commandments
   of God, and without virtues; and empty and united with God, without
   love and charity. And they would be God-seeing men without loving and
   steadfast contemplation, and the holiest of all men living without the
   works of holiness. And they say that they rest in Him Whom they do not
   love; and are uplifted into That which they neither will nor desire.
   And they say that they are stripped of every virtue, and of diligent
   devotion to God, lest they should hinder God in His working. They
   confess, indeed, that God is the Creator and Lord over all creatures,
   and yet they will neither thank nor praise Him. They confess that His
   power and His riches are without end, and yet they say that He can
   neither give nor take from them anything, neither can they grow nor
   acquire merit.

   And sometimes too they uphold the opposite, and say that they merit a
   greater wage than other men; for God does their works, and they
   themselves endure passively the workings of God, without co-operation,
   since these are worked of Him. And in this, they say, lies the supreme
   merit. But this is altogether illusion and impossibility. For the
   activity of God is in itself eternal and unchangeable; for He is His
   own activity and nought else. And in this working there can be no
   growth, nor merit of any creature whatsoever; for here there is nothing
   but God, Who can neither wax nor wane. But the creatures, by virtue of
   God, have their own activity, in nature and in grace, and also in
   glory: and if their works end in grace here, they shall continue in
   glory for ever. Now were it possible, which it is not, that a spiritual
   creature could be annihilated as regards its activity, and thereby
   became even as empty as it was when it was not made--that is, that it
   could become wholly one with God, as it was then--it could acquire no
   merit, no more than it could before creation. Further, it would be
   neither holier nor more blessed than a stone or a log of wood; for
   without our own work and the knowledge and love of God, we cannot be
   blessed. Though God would indeed be blessed, as He is eternally, yet it
   would not avail us. And therefore that which these say of their
   emptiness is all deceit; for they wish to excuse all wickedness and
   perversity, and give these out as nobler and more sublime than all the
   virtues. And they would cunningly disguise the worst, so that it should
   seem the best. All these are contrary to God and all His saints; but
   they have a likeness to the damned spirits in hell, for these too are
   without charity and without knowledge, and are empty of thanksgivings
   and praise and of all loving adherence; and this is the cause, why they
   remain damned in eternity. And that these folk may be like to them,
   they lack only this, that they should fall from time into eternity, and
   that the justice of God be revealed in their works.

   But Christ the Son of God, Who according to His manhood is the pattern
   and the head of all good men, showing them how to live, He was and is
   and everlastingly shall abide with all His members, that is, with all
   His saints, in love and longing, thankfulness and praise, toward His
   heavenly Father. Nevertheless, His soul was and is united with the
   Divine Essence and blessed therein. But to this bare idleness He never
   could, nor ever shall, come; for His glorified soul, and all who are
   blessed, have an eternal loving striving, even as those who have tasted
   of God, and are hungry and thirsty, and can nevermore be satisfied. Yet
   that very soul of Christ, and all saints, partake of God above all
   desires, where there is nothing but the One. This is the eternal bliss
   of God and of all His chosen. And that is why fruition and activity are
   the blessedness of Christ and all His saints; and this is the life of
   all good men, each according to the measure of his love. And this is a
   righteousness that shall never pass away. And that is why we should
   adorn ourselves, from without and from within, with virtues and with
   goodly behaviour, as do the saints; and should lovingly and humbly
   exercise ourselves before the eyes of God in all our works. Then we
   shall meet God by means of all His gifts. And then we shall be touched
   by sensible love, and shall be filled with loyalty towards all. And so
   we shall flow forth and flow back again in true charity, and shall be
   firmly established and steadfast within ourselves in simple peace and
   in the Divine likeness. And by means of this likeness and fruitive love
   and the Divine brightness, we shall be melted into the unity, and shall
   meet God through God, without means, in fruitive rest. And so we shall
   eternally remain within, and yet continually flow forth and incessantly
   flow back again. And herewith we shall possess a veritable inward life
   in all perfection, That this may come to pass in us, so help us God.
   AMEN.

CHAPTER I

  SHOWING THE THREE WAYS BY WHICH ONE ENTERS INTO THE GOD-SEEING LIFE

   The inward lover of God, who possesses God in fruitive love, and
   himself in adhering and active love, and his whole life in virtues
   according to righteousness; through these three things, and by the
   mysterious revelation of God, such an inward man enters into the
   God-seeing life. Yea, the lover who is inward and righteous, him will
   it please God in His freedom to choose and to lift up into a
   superessential contemplation, in the Divine Light and according to the
   Divine Way. [70] This contemplation sets us in purity and clearness
   above all our understanding, for it is a singular adornment and a
   heavenly crown, and besides the eternal reward of all virtues and of
   our whole life. And to it none can attain through knowledge and
   subtlety, neither through any exercise whatsoever. Only he with whom it
   pleases God to be united in His Spirit, and whom it pleases Him to
   enlighten by Himself, can see God, and no one else. The mysterious
   Divine Nature is eternally and actively beholding and loving according
   to the Persons, and has everlasting fruition in a mutual embrace of the
   Persons in the unity of the Essence. In this embrace, in the essential
   Unity of God, all inward spirits are one with God in the immersion of
   love; and are that same one which the Essence is in Itself, according
   to the mode of Eternal Bliss. [71] And in this most high unity of the
   Divine Nature, the heavenly Father is origin and beginning of every
   work which is worked in heaven and on earth. And He says in the deep
   sunken hiddenness of the spirit: Behold, the Bride groom cometh; go ye
   out to meet Him.

   These words we will now explain and set forth in their relation to that
   superessential contemplation which is the source of all holiness, and
   of all perfection of life to which one may attain. Few men can attain
   to this Divine seeing, because of their own in capacity and the
   mysteriousness of the light in which one sees. And therefore no one
   will thoroughly understand the meaning of it by any learning or subtle
   consideration of his own; for all words, and all that may be learnt and
   understood in a creaturely way, are foreign to, and far below, the
   truth which I mean. But he who is united with God, and is en lightened
   in this truth, he is able to understand the truth by itself. For to
   comprehend and to under stand God above all similitudes, such as He is
   in Himself, is to be God with God, without intermediary, and without
   any otherness that can become a hindrance or an intermediary. And
   therefore I beg every one who cannot understand this, or feel it in the
   fruitive unity of his spirit, that he be not offended at it, and leave
   it for that which it is: for that which I am going to say is true, and
   Christ, the Eternal Truth, has said it Himself in His teaching in many
   places, if we could but show and explain it rightly. And therefore,
   whosoever wishes to understand this must have died to himself, and must
   live in God, and must turn his gaze to the eternal light in the ground
   of his spirit, where the Hidden Truth reveals Itself without means. For
   our Heavenly Father wills that we should see; for He is the Father of
   Light, and this is why He utters eternally, without intermediary and
   without interruption, in the hiddenness of our spirit, one unique and
   abysmal word, and no other. And in this word, He utters Himself and all
   things. And this word is none other than: Behold. And this is the
   coming forth and the birth of the Son of Eternal Light, in Whom all
   blessedness is known and seen.

   Now if the spirit would see God with God in this Divine light without
   means, there needs must be on the part of man three things.

   The first is that he must be perfectly ordered from without in all the
   virtues, and within must be unencumbered, and as empty of every outward
   work as if he did not work at all: for if his emptiness is troubled
   within by some work of virtue, he has an image; and as long as this
   endures within him, he cannot contemplate.

   Secondly, he must inwardly cleave to God, with adhering intention and
   love, even as a burning and glowing fire which can never more be
   quenched. As long as he feels himself to be in this state, he is able
   to contemplate.

   Thirdly, he must have lost himself in a Waylessness and in a Darkness,
   in which all contemplative men wander in fruition and wherein they
   never again can find themselves in a creaturely way. In the abyss of
   this darkness, in which the loving spirit has died to itself, there
   begin the manifestation of God and eternal life. For in this darkness
   there shines and is born an incomprehensible Light, which is the Son of
   God, in Whom we behold eternal life. And in this Light one becomes
   seeing; and this Divine Light is given to the simple sight of the
   spirit, where the spirit receives the brightness which is God Himself,
   above all gifts and every creaturely activity, in the idle emptiness in
   which the spirit has lost itself through fruitive love, and where it
   receives without means the brightness of God, and is changed without
   interruption into that brightness which it receives. Behold, this
   mysterious brightness, in which one sees everything that one can desire
   according to the emptiness of the spirit: this brightness is so great
   that the loving contemplative, in his ground wherein he rests, sees and
   feels nothing but an incomprehensible Light; and through that Simple
   Nudity which enfolds all things, he finds himself, and feels himself,
   to be that same Light by which he sees, and nothing else. [72] And this
   is the first condition by which one becomes seeing in the Divine Light.
   Blessed are the eyes which are thus seeing, for they possess eternal
   life.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [70] This entrance of the soul into the God-seeing life is the
   equivalent of Dante's entrance into the Empyrean. ". . . noi semo
   usciti fuore del maggior corpo al ciel, ch' é pura luce; luce
   intellettual piena d'amore, amor di vero ben pien di letizia, letizia
   che trascende ogni dolzore." (Par. xxx. 38.)

   [71] So Dionysius: "The Beginning and Cause beyond all beginning of
   every being, grasping all things superessentially in an irresistible
   embrace." (Celestial Hierarchy, cap. 7.)

   [72] "When this takes place," says Plotinus, "the soul will see both
   God and herself, so far as it is lawful for her to see Him. And she
   will see herself indeed illumined, and full of intelligible light; or
   rather, she will perceive herself to be pure light." (On the Good, or
   the One.)

CHAPTER II

  HOW THE ETERNAL BIRTH OF GOD IS RENEWED WITHOUT INTERRUPTION IN THE NOBILITY
  OF THE SPIRIT

   When we have thus become seeing, we can behold in joy the eternal
   coming of our Bridegroom; and that is the second point of which we
   would speak. What is this coming of our Bridegroom which is eternal? It
   is the new birth and a new enlightenment without interruption; for the
   ground from which the Light shines forth, and which is the Light
   itself, is life-giving and fruitful, and therefore the manifestation of
   the Eternal Light is renewed without ceasing in the hiddenness of the
   spirit. Behold, every creaturely work, and every exercise of virtue,
   must here cease; for here God works alone in the high nobility of the
   spirit. And here there is nothing but an eternal seeing and staring at
   that Light, by that Light, and in that Light. And the coming of the
   Bridegroom is so swift that He is perpetually coming, and yet dwelling
   within with unfathomable riches; and ever coming anew, in His Person,
   without interruption, with such new brightness that it seems as though
   he had never come before. For His coming consists, beyond time, in an
   eternal Now, which is ever received with new longings and new joy.
   Behold, the delight and the joy which this Bridegroom brings with Him
   in His coming are boundless and without measure, for they are Himself.
   And this is why the eyes with which the spirit sees and gazes at its
   Bridegroom, have opened so wide that they can never close again. For
   the spirit continues for ever to see and to stare at the secret
   manifestation of God. And the grasp of the spirit is opened so wide for
   the coming in of the Bridegroom, that the spirit itself becomes that
   Breadth Which it grasps. And so God is grasped and beheld through God;
   wherein rests all our blessedness. This is the second point: in which
   we receive, without interruption, the eternal coming of our Bridegroom
   in our spirit.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER III

  HOW OUR SPIRIT IS CALLED TO GO OUT IN CONTEMPLATION AND FRUITION

   Now the Spirit of God says in the secret outpouring of our spirit: Go
   ye out, in an eternal contemplation and fruition, according to the way
   of God. All the riches which are in God by nature we possess by way of
   love in God, and God in us, through the unmeasured love which is the
   Holy Ghost, for in this love one tastes of all that one can desire. And
   therefore through this love we are dead to ourselves, and have gone
   forth in loving immersion into Waylessness and Darkness. There the
   spirit is embraced by the Holy Trinity, and dwells for ever within the
   superessential Unity, in rest and fruition. And in that same Unity,
   according to Its fruitfulness, the Father dwells in the Son, and the
   Son in the Father, and all creatures dwell in Both. And this is above
   the distinction of the Persons; for here by means of the reason we
   understand Fatherhood and Sonhood as the life-giving fruitfulness of
   the Divine Nature.

   Here there arise and begin an eternal going out and an eternal work
   which is without beginning; for here there is a beginning with
   beginning. For, after the Almighty Father had perfectly comprehended
   Himself in the ground of His fruitfulness, so the Son, the Eternal Word
   of the Father, came forth as the second Person in the Godhead. And,
   through the Eternal Birth, all creatures have come forth in eternity,
   before they were created in time. So God has seen and known them in
   Himself, according to distinction, in living ideas, [73] and in an
   otherness from Himself; but not as something other in all ways, for all
   that is in God is God. [74] This eternal going out and this eternal
   life, which we have and are in God eternally, without ourselves, is the
   cause of our created being in time. And our created being abides in the
   Eternal Essence and is one with it in its essential existence. And this
   eternal life and being, which we have and are in the eternal Wisdom of
   God, is like unto God. For it has an eternal immanence in the Divine
   Essence, without distinction; and through the birth of the Son it has
   an eternal outflowing in a distinction and otherness, according to the
   Eternal Idea. And through these two points it is so like unto God that
   He knows and reflects Himself in this likeness without cessation,
   according to the Essence and according to the Persons. For, though even
   here there are distinction and otherness according to intellectual
   perception, yet this likeness is one with that same Image of the Holy
   Trinity, which is the wisdom of God and in which God beholds Himself
   and all things in an eternal Now, without before and after. In a single
   seeing He beholds Himself and all things. And this is the Image and the
   Likeness of God, and our Image and our Likeness; for in it God reflects
   Himself and all things. In this Divine Image all creatures have an
   eternal life, outside themselves, as in their eternal Archetype, and
   after this eternal Image, and in this Likeness, we have been made by
   the Holy Trinity. And therefore God wills that we shall go forth from
   ourselves in this Divine Light, and shall reunite ourselves in a
   supernatural way with this Image, which is our proper life, and shall
   possess it with Him, in action and in fruition, in eternal bliss.

   For we know well that the bosom of the Father is our ground and origin,
   in which we begin our being and our life. And from our proper ground
   that is from the Father and from all that lives in Him there shines
   forth an eternal brightness, which is the birth of the Son. And in this
   brightness, that is, in the Son, the Father knows Himself and all that
   lives in Him; for all that He has, and all that He is, He gives to the
   Son, save only the property of Fatherhood, which abides in Himself. And
   this is why all that lives in the Father, unmanifested in the Unity, is
   also in the Son actively poured forth into manifestation: and the
   simple ground of our Eternal Image ever remains in darkness and in
   waylessness, but the brightness without limit which streams forth from
   it, this reveals and brings forth within the Conditioned the hiddenness
   of God. And all those men who are raised up above their created being
   into a God-seeing life are one with this Divine brightness. And they
   are that brightness itself, and they see feel, and find, even by means
   of this Divine Light, that, as regards their uncreated essence, they
   are that same onefold ground from which the brightness without limit
   shines forth in the Divine way, and which, according to the simplicity
   of the Essence, abides eternally onefold and wayless within. And this
   is why inward and God-seeing men will go out in the way of
   contemplation, above reason and above distinction and above their
   created being, through an eternal intuitive gazing. By means of this
   inborn light they are transfigured, and made one with that same light
   through which they see and which they see. [75] And thus the God-seeing
   men follow after their Eternal Image, after which they have been made;
   and they behold God and all things, without distinction, in a simple
   seeing, in the Divine brightness. And this is the most noble and the
   most profitable contemplation to which one can attain in this life; for
   in this contemplation, a man best remains master of himself and free.
   And at each loving introversion he may grow in nobility of life beyond
   anything that we are able to understand; for he remains free and master
   of himself in inwardness and virtue. And this gazing at the Divine
   Light holds him up above all inwardness and all virtue and all merit,
   for it is the crown and the reward after which we strive, and which we
   have and possess now in this wise; for a God-seeing life is a heavenly
   life. But were we set free from this misery and this exile, so we
   should have, as regards our created being, a greater capacity to
   receive this brightness; and so the glory of God would shine through us
   in every way better and more nobly. This is the way above all ways, in
   which one goes out through Divine contemplation and an eternal
   intuitive gazing, and in which one is transfigured and transmuted in
   the Divine brightness. This going out of the God-seeing man is also in
   love; for through the fruition of love he rises above his created
   being, and finds and tastes the riches and the delights which are God
   Himself, and which He causes to pour forth without interruption in the
   hiddenness of the spirit, where the spirit is like unto the nobility of
   God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [73] "In levenden redenen," perhaps more exactly "in life-giving
   ideas." Surius, in his great Latin translation renders, this, "sub
   vividis rationibus." This is one of the passages in which the Platonic
   character of Ruysbroeck's doctrine is specially marked.

   [74] Suso expresses this doctrine with even greater daring-- "Mark
   this: in eternity, all creatures are God in God; and there, there is no
   fundamental difference between them, save that which we have said. And
   in so much as they are in God, they are the same life, the same being,
   the same power: they are the same One, and nothing less. (Suso, The
   Book of Truth, cap. 3.)

   [75] Thus Dionysius says, "We should know that our mind has the power
   of thought, through which it perceives intellectual things: but the
   union through which it is brought into contact with things beyond
   itself surpasses the nature of the mind. We must therefore contemplate
   Divine things by means of this union; not in ourselves, but by standing
   out of ourselves with our whole selves and becoming wholly of God. For
   it is better to be of God than of ourselves." (Divine Names, cap 7.)
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER IV

  OF A DIVINE MEETING WHICH TAKES PLACE IN THE HIDDENNESS OF OUR SPIRIT

   When the inward and God-seeing man has thus attained to his Eternal
   Image, and in this clearness, through the Son, has entered into the
   bosom of the Father: then he is enlightened by Divine truth, and he
   receives anew, every moment, the Eternal Birth, and he goes forth
   according to the way of the light, in a Divine contemplation. And here
   there begins the fourth and last point; namely, a loving meeting, in
   which, above all else, our highest blessedness consists.

   You should know that the heavenly Father, as a living ground, with all
   that lives in Him, is actively turned towards His Son, as to His own
   Eternal Wisdom. And that same Wisdom, with all that lives in It, is
   actively turned back towards the Father, that is, towards that very
   ground from which It comes forth. And in this meeting, there comes
   forth the third Person, between the Father and the Son; that is the
   Holy Ghost, Their mutual Love, who is one with them Both in the same
   nature. And He enfolds and drenches through both in action and fruition
   the Father and the Son, and all that lives in Both, with such great
   riches and such joy that as to this all creatures must eternally be
   silent; for the incomprehensible wonder of this love, eternally
   transcends the understanding of all creatures. But where this wonder is
   understood and tasted without amazement, [76] there the spirit dwells
   above itself, and is one with the Spirit of God; and tastes and sees
   without measure, even as God, the riches which are the spirit itself in
   the unity of the living ground, where it possesses itself according to
   the way of its uncreated essence.

   Now this rapturous meeting is incessantly and actively renewed in us,
   according to the way of God; for the Father gives Himself in the Son,
   and the Son gives Himself in the Father, in an eternal content and a
   loving embrace; and this renews itself every moment within the bonds of
   love. For like as the Father incessantly beholds all things in the
   birth of His Son, so all things are loved anew by the Father and the
   Son in the outpouring of the Holy Ghost. And this is the active meeting
   of the Father and of the Son, in which we are lovingly embraced by the
   Holy Ghost in eternal love.

   Now this active meeting and this loving embrace are in their ground
   fruitive and wayless; for the abysmal Waylessness of God is so dark and
   so unconditioned that it swallows up in itself every Divine way and
   activity, and all the attributes of the Persons, within the rich
   compass of the essential Unity, and it brings about a Divine fruition
   in the abyss of the Ineffable. And here there is a death in fruition,
   and a melting and dying into the Essential Nudity, where all the Divine
   names, and all conditions, and all the living images which are
   reflected in the mirror of Divine Truth, lapse in the Onefold and
   Ineffable, in waylessness and without reason. For in this unfathomable
   abyss of the Simplicity, all things are wrapped in fruitive bliss; and
   the abyss itself may not be comprehended, unless by the Essential
   Unity. To this the Persons, and all that lives in God, must give place;
   for here there is nought else but an eternal rest in the fruitive
   embrace of an outpouring Love. And this is that wayless being which all
   interior spirits have chosen above all other things. This is the dark
   silence in which all lovers lose themselves. But if we would prepare
   ourselves for it by means of the virtues, we should strip ourselves of
   all but our very bodies, and should flee forth into the wild Sea,
   whence no created thing can draw us back again. [77]

   May we possess in fruition the essential Unity, and clearly behold
   unity in the Trinity; this may Divine Love, which turns no beggar away,
   bestow upon us. Amen.

  HERE ENDS THE BOOK OF THE ADORNMENT OF THE SPIRITUAL MARRIAGE

   wonder."

   [77] The last phrases of this passage are written in the irregular
   rhymed verse which Ruysbroeck so often interpolated in his prose
   writings. It has been found impossible to give a sufficiently close
   English rendering of this. I therefore give the original Flemish as an
   example of his poetic style-- "En dit is in dat wiselose wesen dat age
   ynnighe gheeste boven alle dinc hebben vercoren, Dit is die donkere
   stille daer alle minnende in sijn verloren: Maer moche wi ons aldus in
   doghenden ghereden, Wi souden ons schiere van den live ontcleden, En
   souden vlieten in wilde zeebaren: Nemmermeer en mochte ons creature
   verhalen."

PROLOGUE

   The man who would live in the most perfect state of Holy Church must be
   a good and zealous man; an inward and ghostly man; an uplifted and
   God-seeing man; and an outflowing man to all in common. Whenever these
   four things are together in a man, then his state is perfect; and
   through the increase of grace he shall continually grow and progress in
   all virtues, and in the knowledge of truth, before God and before all
   men.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER I

  THROUGH THREE THINGS A MAN BECOMES GOOD

   Hear now three things which constitute a good man. The first, which a
   good man must have, is a clean conscience without reproach of mortal
   sin. And therefore whosoever wishes to become a good man must examine
   and prove himself with due discernment, from that time onward when he
   could first have committed sin. And from all these sins he must purge
   himself, according to the precept and the custom of Holy Church.

   The second thing which pertains to a good man is that he must in all
   things be obedient to God, and to Holy Church, and to his own proper
   convictions. And to each of these three he must be equally obedient: so
   shall he live without care and doubt, and shall ever abide without
   inward reproach in all his deeds.

   The third thing which behoves every good man is that in all his deeds
   he should have in mind, above all else, the glory of God. And if it
   happens that by reason of his business or the multiplicity of his
   works, he has not always God before his eyes, yet at least there should
   be established in him the intention and desire to live according to the
   dearest will of God.

   Behold, these three things, when they are possessed in this way, make a
   man good. And whosoever lacks any one of these three is neither good
   nor in the grace of God; but whenever a man resolves in his heart to
   fulfil these three points, how wicked soever he may have been before,
   in that very instant he becomes good, and is susceptible of God, and
   filled with the grace of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER II

  THROUGH THREE THINGS A MAN BECOMES INWARD

   If, further, this good man would become an inward and ghostly man, he
   needs must have three further things. The first is a heart unencumbered
   with images; the second is spiritual freedom in his desires, the third
   is the feeling of inward union with God. [78]

   Now let every one who thinks himself to be ghostly observe himself. He
   who would have a heart void of images may not possess anything with
   affection, nor may he cling to any one, or have intercourse with him
   with attachment of the will; for all intercourse and all affection
   which do not aim purely at the honour of God bring images into a man's
   heart, since they are born, not of God, but of the flesh. And so if a
   man would become spiritual, he must forsake all fleshly lusts and loves
   and must cleave with longing and love to God alone, and thus possess
   Him. And through this, all imaginations and all inordinate love towards
   creatures are cast out. And this loving possession of God makes a man
   inwardly free from ungodly images; for God is a Spirit, of Whom no one
   can make to himself a true image. Certainly in this exercise a man
   should lay hold of good images to help him; such as the Passion of our
   Lord and all those things that may stir him to greater devotion. But in
   the possession of God, the man must sink down to that imageless Nudity
   which is God; and this is the first condition, and the foundation, of a
   ghostly life.

   The second condition is inward freedom. Through this, the man should be
   able to raise himself towards God in all inward exercises, free from
   images and encumbrances; that is, in thanksgiving and praise, in
   worship, in devout prayer and fervent love, and in all those things
   that may be done by longing and love with the help of the grace of God
   and through inward zeal in all ghostly exercises.

   Through this inward exercise, he reaches the third state; which is that
   he feels a ghostly union with God. Whosoever then has, in his inward
   exercise, an imageless and free ascent unto his God, and means nought
   else but the glory of God, must taste of the goodness of God; and he
   must feel from within a true union with God. And in this union, the
   inward and spiritual life is made perfect; for in this union, the
   desirous power is perpetually enticed anew and stirred to new inward
   activity. And by each act, the spirit rises upwards to a new union. And
   so activity and union perpetually renew themselves; and this perpetual
   renewal in activity and in union is a ghostly life. And so you are now
   able to see how a man becomes good through the moral virtues and an
   upright intention; and how he may become ghostly through the inward
   virtues and union with God. But without these said points, he can
   neither be good nor ghostly.

     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER III

  THROUGH THREE THINGS A MAN BECOMES GOD-SEEING

   Further, you must know that if this ghostly man would now become a
   God-seeing man, he needs must have three other things. The first is the
   feeling that the foundation of his being is abysmal, and he should
   possess it in this manner; the second is that his inward exercise
   should be wayless; the third is that his indwelling should be a divine
   fruition.

   Now understand, you who would live in the spirit, for I am speaking to
   no one else. The union with God which a spiritual man feels, when the
   union is revealed to the spirit as being abysmal--that is, measureless
   depth, measureless height, measureless length and measureless
   breadth--in this manifestation the spirit perceives that through love
   it has plunged itself into the depth and has ascended into the height
   and escaped into the length; and it feels itself to be wandering in the
   breadth, and to dwell in a knowledge which is ignorance. And through
   this intimate feeling of union, it feels itself to be melting into the
   Unity; and, through dying to all things, into the life of God. And
   there it feels itself to be one life with God. And this is the
   foundation, and the first point, of the God-seeing life.

   And from this there arises the second point, which is an exercise above
   reason and without condition: for the Divine Unity, of which every
   God-seeing spirit has entered into possession in love, eternally draws
   and invites the Divine Persons and all loving spirits into its self.
   And this inward drawing is felt by each lover, more or less, according
   to the measure of his love and the manner of his exercise. And
   whosoever yields himself to this indrawing, and keeps himself therein,
   cannot fall into mortal sin. But the God-seeing man who has forsaken
   self and all things, and does not feel himself drawn away because he no
   longer possesses anything as his own, but stands empty of all, he can
   always enter, naked and unencumbered with images, into the inmost part
   of his spirit. There he finds revealed an Eternal Light, and in this
   light, he feels the eternal demand of the Divine Unity; and he feels
   himself to be an eternal fire of love, which craves above all else to
   be one with God. The more he yields to this indrawing or demand, the
   more he feels it. And the more he feels it, the more he craves to be
   one with God; for it urges him to pay the debt which is demanded of him
   by God. This eternal demand of the Divine Unity kindles within the
   spirit an eternal fire of love; and though the spirit incessantly pays
   the debt, an eternal burning continues within it. For, in the
   transformation within the Unity, all spirits fail in their own
   activity, and feel nothing else but a burning up of themselves in the
   simple Unity of God. This simple Unity of God none can feel or possess
   save he who maintains himself in the immeasurable radiance, and in the
   love which is above reason and wayless. In this transcendent state the
   spirit feels in itself the eternal fire of love; and in this fire of
   love it finds neither beginning nor end, and it feels itself one with
   this fire of love. The spirit for ever continues to burn in itself, for
   its love is eternal; and it feels itself ever more and more to be burnt
   up in love, for it is drawn and transformed into the Unity of God,
   where the spirit burns in love. If it observes itself, it finds a
   distinction and an otherness between itself and God; but where it is
   burnt up it is undifferentiated and without distinction, and therefore
   it feels nothing but unity; for the flame of the Love of God consumes
   and devours all that it can enfold in its Self.

   And thus you may see that the indrawing Unity of God is nought else
   than the fathomless Love, which lovingly draws inward, in eternal
   fruition, the Father and the Son and all that lives in Them. And in
   this Love we shall burn and be burnt up without end, throughout
   eternity; for herein lies the blessedness of all spirits. And therefore
   we must all found our lives upon a fathomless abyss; that we may
   eternally plunge into Love, and sink down in the fathomless Depth. And
   with that same Love, we shall ascend, and transcend ourselves, in the
   incomprehensible Height. And in that Love which is wayless, we shall
   wander and stray, and it shall lead us and lose us in the immeasurable
   Breadth of the Love of God. And herein we shall flee forth and flee out
   of ourselves, into the unknown raptures of the Goodness and Riches of
   God. And therein we shall melt and be melted away, and shall eternally
   wander and sojourn within the Glory of God. Behold! by each of these
   images, I show forth to God-seeing men their being and their exercise,
   but none else can understand them. For the contemplative life cannot be
   taught. But where the Eternal Truth reveals Itself within the spirit
   all that is needful is taught and learnt.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER IV

  OF THE SPARKLING STONE, AND OF THE NEW NAME WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE SECRETS
  OF GOD

   And therefore the Spirit of our Lord speaks thus in the Book of the
   Secrets of God, which St John wrote down: to him that overcometh, He
   says, that is, to him who overcometh and conquereth himself and all
   else, will I give to eat of the hidden manna, that is, an inward and
   hidden savour and celestial joy; and will give him a sparkling stone,
   and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that
   receiveth it. This stone is called a pebble, [79] for it is so small
   that it does not hurt when one treads on it. This stone is shining
   white and red like a flame of fire; and it is small and round, and
   smooth all over, and very light. By this sparkling stone we mean our
   Lord Christ Jesus, for He is, according to His Godhead, a shining forth
   of the Eternal Light, and an irradiation of the glory of God, and a
   flawless mirror in which all things live. Now to him who overcomes and
   transcends all things, this sparkling stone is given; and with it he
   receives light and truth and life. This stone is also like to a fiery
   flame, for the fiery love of the Eternal Word has filled the whole
   world with love and wills that all loving spirits be burned up to
   nothingness in love. This stone is also so small that a man hardly
   feels it, even though he treads it underfoot. And that is why it is
   called calculus, that is, "treadling." And this is made clear to us by
   St Paul, where he says that the Son of God emptied Himself, and humbled
   Himself, and took upon Him the form of a servant and became obedient
   unto death, even the death of the cross. And He Himself spoke through
   the mouth of the Prophet, saying: I am a worm, and no man: a reproach
   of men and despised of the people. And He made Himself so small in time
   that the Jews trod Him under their feet. But they felt Him not; for,
   had they recognized the Son of God, they had not dared to crucify Him.
   He is still little and despised in all men's hearts that do not love
   Him well. This noble stone of which I speak is wholly round and smooth
   and even all over. That the stone is round teaches us that the Divine
   Truth has neither beginning nor end; that it is smooth and even all
   over teaches us that the Divine Truth shall weigh all things evenly,
   and shall give to each according to his merits; and that which he gives
   shall be with each throughout eternity. The last property of this stone
   of which I will speak is, that it is particularly light; for the
   Eternal Word of the Father has no weight, nevertheless It bears heaven
   and earth by Its strength. And It is equally near to all things; yet
   none can attain It, for It is set on high and goes before all
   creatures, and reveals Itself where It wills and when It wills; and, in
   Its lightness, our heavy human nature has climbed above all the
   heavens, and sits crowned at the right hand of the Father.

   Behold, this is the sparkling stone which is given to the God-seeing
   man, and in this stone a new name is written, which no man knoweth
   saving he that receiveth it. You should know that all spirits in their
   return towards God receive names; each one in particular, according to
   the nobleness of its service and the loftiness of its love. For only
   the first name of innocence, which we receive at baptism, is adorned
   with the merits of our Lord Jesus Christ. And when we have lost this
   name of innocence through sin, if we are willing still to follow
   God--especially in three works which He wishes to work in us--we are
   baptized once more in the Holy Ghost. And thereby we receive a new name
   which shall remain with us throughout eternity.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [79] Ruysbroeck wrote, or dictated, terdelinc, literally "tread-ling,"
   probably imagining some relation between calculus (pebble), from calx
   (stone), and calcare (to tread), from calx (knuckle, heel).
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER V

  OF THE WORKS WHICH GOD WORKS IN ALL IN COMMON AND OF FIVE KINDS OF SINNERS

   Hear now what those three works are, which our Lord works in all men if
   they will submit themselves thereto. The first work which God works in
   all men in common consists in His calling and inviting them all,
   without exception, to union with Himself. And as long as a sinner does
   not follow this call, he must lack all the other gifts which would
   follow thereafter.

   Now I have observed that all sinners may be divided into five kinds. To
   the first kind belong all those who are careless of good works, who
   through bodily ease and the lust of the senses prefer to live in
   worldly employments and in multiplicity of heart. All such are unfit to
   receive the grace of God, and even if they had received it, they would
   not be able to keep it.

   To the second kind belong those who have willingly and wittingly fallen
   into mortal sin, yet also do good works, and dwell in the fear and awe
   of the Lord, and love the just, and desire their prayers, and put their
   trust therein. So long, however, as turning from God and love of sin
   vanquish and repulse love of God and turning to God, so long these
   remain unworthy of the grace of God.

   The third kind of sinners consists in all unbelievers, and those who
   err in faith. What good works soever they do, or what lives soever they
   lead, without the true faith they cannot please God; for true faith is
   the foundation of all holiness and all virtues.

   To the fourth kind belong those who abide in mortal sin without fear
   and without shame, who care not for God and His gifts, and neglect all
   virtues. They hold all ghostly life to be hypocrisy and deceit; and
   they hardly listen to all that one may say to them of God or of the
   virtues, for they have established themselves as though there were no
   God, nor heaven, nor hell, and therefore they desire to know of nothing
   but that which they now perceive and have before them. Behold, all such
   are rejected and despised by God, for they sin against the Holy Ghost.
   Yet they may be converted; but this happens with difficulty and seldom.

   The fifth kind of sinners are those hypocrites who do outward good
   works, not for the glory of God and their own salvation, but to acquire
   a name for holiness or for the sake of some fleeting thing. Though they
   may appear holy and good from without, within they are false and turned
   away from God, and they lack the grace of God and every virtue.

   See, I have shown to you five kinds of sinners, who have all been
   inwardly called to union with God. But so long as a sinner remains in
   the service of sin, so long he remains deaf and blind and unable to
   taste, or to feel, all the good that God wishes to work in him. But
   whenever a sinner enters into himself, and considers himself, if he be
   displeased by his sinful life, then he draws near to God. But if he
   would be obedient to the call and the words of God, he must of his own
   free will resolve to leave sin and to do penance. And so he becomes one
   aim and one will with God, and receives the grace of God.

   And therefore we should all conceive of God in this way: First of all
   that, of His free goodness, He calls and invites all men, without
   distinction, to union with Himself; both the good and the wicked,
   without exception. Secondly, we should thus comprehend the goodness of
   God; how He through grace flows forth towards all men who are obedient
   to the call of God. Thirdly, we should find and understand clearly in
   ourselves that we can become one life and one spirit with God, when we
   renounce ourselves in every way, and follow the grace of God to the
   height whereto it would guide us. For the grace of God works according
   to order in every man, after the measure and the way in which he is
   able to receive it. And thereby, through the universal working of the
   grace of God, every sinner, if he desires it, receives the discernment
   and strength which are needful, that he may leave sin and turn towards
   virtue. And, through that hidden cooperation of the grace of God, every
   good man can overcome all sins, and can resist all temptations, and can
   fulfil all virtues, and can persevere in the highest perfection, if he
   be in all things submissive to the grace of God. For all that we are,
   and all that we have received, from without and from within, these are
   all the free gifts of God; for which we must thank and praise Him, and
   with which we must serve Him, if we are to please Him. But there are
   many gifts of God which are for the good an aid to, and a source of,
   virtue; but for the wicked an aid to, and an occasion of, sin: such are
   health, beauty, wisdom riches, and worldly dignity. These are the
   lowest and least precious gifts of God, which God gives for the benefit
   of all, to His friends and to His enemies, to the good and to the
   wicked. And with these the good serve God and His friends; but the
   wicked, their own flesh, and the devil, and the world.

CHAPTER VI

  OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HIRELINGS AND THE FAITHFUL SERVANTS OF GOD

   Now you may mark this: that some men receive the gifts of God as
   hirelings, but others as faithful servants of God; and these differ one
   from another in all inward works, that is, in love and intention, in
   feeling and in every exercise of the inward life.

   Now understand this well: all those who love themselves so inordinately
   that they will not serve God, save for their own profit and because of
   their own reward, these separate themselves from God, and dwell in
   bondage and in their own selfhood; for they seek, and aim at, their
   own, in all that they do. And therefore, with all their prayers and
   with all their good works, they seek after temporal things, or maybe
   strive after eternal things for their own benefit and for their own
   profit. These men are bent upon themselves in an inordinate way; and
   that is why they ever abide alone with themselves, for they lack the
   true love which would unite them with God and with all His beloved. And
   although these men seem to keep within the law and the commandments of
   God and of Holy Church, they do not keep within the law of love; for
   all that they do, they do, not out of love, but from sheer necessity,
   lest they shall be damned. And, because they are inwardly unfaithful,
   they dare not trust in God; but their whole inward life is doubt and
   fear, travail and misery. For they see on the right hand eternal life,
   and this they are afraid of losing; and they see on the left hand the
   eternal pains of hell, and these they are afraid of gaining. But all
   their prayers, all their labour and all the good works, whatsoever they
   do, to cast out this fear, help them not; for the more inordinately
   they love themselves, the more they fear hell. And from this you may
   learn that their fear of hell springs from self-love, which seeks its
   own.

   Now the Prophet, and also the Preacher, say: The fear of the Lord is
   the beginning of wisdom; but by this is meant that fear which is
   exercised upon the right side, where one considers the loss of eternal
   blessedness, for this fear arises from the natural tendency which every
   man has in himself to be blessed, that is, to see God. And therefore,
   even though a man may be faithless to God, yet whenever he truly
   observes himself from within, he feels himself to be leaning out from
   himself towards that blessedness which is God. And this blessedness he
   fears to lose; for he loves himself better than God, and he loves
   blessedness wholly for his own sake. And therefore he dare not trust in
   God. And yet this is that Fear of the Lord which is the beginning of
   wisdom and is a law to the unfaithful servants of God: for it compels a
   man to leave sin, and to strive after virtue, and to do good deeds, and
   these things prepare a man from without to receive the grace of God and
   become a faithful servant.

   But from that very hour in which, with God's help, he can overcome his
   selfhood--that is to say when he is so detached from himself that he is
   able to leave in the keeping of God everything of which he has
   need--behold, through doing this he is so well pleasing to God that God
   bestows upon him His grace. And, through grace, he feels true love: and
   love casts out doubt and fear, and fills the man with hope and trust,
   and thus he becomes a faithful servant, and means and loves God in all
   that he does. Behold, this is the difference between the faithful
   servant and the hireling.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VII

  OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAITHFUL SERVANTS AND THE SECRET FRIENDS OF GOD

   We must now observe the great difference which there is between the
   faithful servants and the inward friends of God. For through grace and
   the help of God, the faithful servants have chosen to keep the
   commandments of God, that is, to be obedient to God and Holy Church in
   all virtues and goodly behaviour: and this is called the outward or
   active life. But the inward friends of God choose to follow, besides
   the commandments, the quickening counsels of God, and this is a loving
   and inward cleaving to God for the sake of His eternal glory, with a
   willing abandonment of all that one may possess outside God with lust
   and love. All such friends God calls and invites inwards, and He
   teaches them the distinctions of inward exercises and many a hidden way
   of ghostly life. But He sends His servants outwards, that they may be
   faithful to Him and to His House in every service and in every kind of
   outward good works.

   Behold, thus God gives His grace and His help to each man according to
   his fitness; that is, according to the way in which he is in tune with
   God, whether in outward good works or in the inward practice of love.
   But none can do and feel the inward exercises unless he be wholly
   turned inward to God. For as long as a man is divided of heart, so long
   he looks outwards, and is unstable of mind, and is easily swayed by joy
   and grief in temporal things, for these are still alive within him. And
   though he may live according to the commandments of God, inwardly he
   abides in darkness, and knows not what inward exercises may be, nor how
   these should be practised. But, since he knows and feels that he has
   God in mind, and in all his works desires to fulfil His dearest will,
   with this he may be content; for then he knows himself to be free from
   hypocrisy in his intention, and faithful in his service. And by these
   two things he contents himself; and it seems to him that outward good
   works done with a pure intention are more holy and more profitable than
   any inward exercise whatever, for by the help of God, he has chosen an
   outward active way of virtue. And therefore he had rather exercise
   himself in the diversity of outward works than serve with inward love
   that same One for Whom he works. And that is the cause why his mind is
   more filled with the works which he does, than with God, for Whom he
   does them. And through this tendency to images in his works, he remains
   an outward man, and is not able to follow the counsels of God; for his
   exercise is more outward than inward, more of the senses than of the
   spirit. Though he is indeed a faithful servant of God in outward works,
   yet that which the secret friends of God experience remains hidden
   from, and unknown to him. And this is why certain gross and outward men
   always condemn and blame the inward and contemplative men, because they
   have in mind that these are idle. And this was also the reason why
   Martha complained to our Lord of her sister Mary, because she did not
   help her in serving; for she believed that she was doing much service
   and much usefulness, and that her sister was sitting idle and doing
   nothing. But our Lord gave His judgment and decided between them: He
   did not blame Martha for her diligence, for her service was good and
   useful; but He blamed her for her care, and because she was troubled
   and cast down by a multitude of outward things. And He praised Mary for
   her inward exercise, and said that One Thing was needful, and that she
   had chosen the better part, which should not be taken away from her.

   That One Thing which is needful for all men is Divine love. The better
   part is an inward life, with loving adherence to God. This Mary
   Magdalen had chosen, and this is chosen by the secret friends of God.
   But Martha chose an outward, unenclosed, and active life; and that is
   the other part, in which one may serve God, but which is neither so
   perfect nor so good. And this part is chosen out of love by the
   faithful servants of God.

   But there are found some foolish men who would be so inward that they
   would neither act nor serve, even in those things of which their
   neighbour has need. Behold, these are neither secret friends nor
   faithful servants of God; but they are altogether false and deceived.
   For no man can follow the counsels of God who will not keep His
   commandments. And therefore all secret friends of God are also at the
   same time faithful servants, wherever this is needful; but all the
   faithful servants are not secret friends, for the exercise which
   belongs thereto is unknown to them.

   This is the difference between the faithful servants and the secret
   friends of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VIII

  OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SECRET FRIENDS AND THE HIDDEN SONS OF GOD

   But further we find a more subtle and inward difference, between the
   secret friends and the hidden sons of God; and yet both these alike by
   their inward exercise maintain themselves in the Presence of God. But
   the friends possess their inwardness as an attribute, for they choose
   the loving adherence to God as best and highest of all that they ever
   can and will reach: and that is why they cannot with themselves and
   their own activity penetrate to the imageless Nudity. For they have, as
   images and intermediaries between God and themselves, their own being
   and their own activity. And though in their loving adherence they feel
   united with God, yet, in this union, they always feel a difference and
   an otherness between God and themselves. For the simple passing into
   the Bare and Wayless, they do not know and love: and therefore their
   highest inward life ever remains in Reason and in Ways. And though they
   have clear understanding and discernment of all virtues that may be
   conceived, the simple staring with open heart into the Divine
   Brightness remains unknown of them. And though they feel themselves
   uplifted to God in a mighty fire of love, yet they keep something of
   their own selfhood, and are not consumed and burnt to nothingness in
   the unity of love. And though they may desire to live for ever more in
   the service of God and to please Him eternally, they will not die in
   God to all the selfhood of their spirit, and receive from Him a
   God-formed life. [80] And even though they esteem little and count as
   nothing all consolation and all rest which may come from without, yet
   they greatly value the gifts of God, and also their own inward works
   and the solace and sweetness which they feel within and thus they rest
   upon the way, and do not so wholly die to themselves, as to be able to
   attain the highest beatitude in bare and wayless love. And even if they
   could practise and apprehend with clear discernment the perfection of
   loving adherence to God, and all the inward and upward going ways by
   which one may pass into the Presence of God; yet the wayless passing,
   and the glorious wandering, in the Superessential Love, wherein neither
   end, nor beginning, nor way, nor manner, can ever be found, would
   remain hidden from, and unknown of them.

   And so there is a great difference between the secret friends and the
   hidden sons of God. For the friends feel nought else but a loving and
   living ascent to God in some wise, but, above this, the sons experience
   a simple and death-like passing which is in no wise.

   The inward life of the friends of our Lord is an upward-striving
   exercise of love, wherein they desire to remain for ever with their own
   selfhood; but how one possesses God through bare love above every
   exercise, in freedom from one's self, this they do not feel. Hence they
   are always striving upwards towards God in true faith, and await God
   and eternal blessedness with sincere hope, and are fastened and
   anchored to God through perfect charity. And therefore good things have
   befallen them, for they please God, and God is complaisant unto them:
   yet for all this, they are not assured of eternal life, for they have
   not entirely died to themselves and to all selfhood. But all those who
   abide and endure in their exercise and in that turning to God which
   they have chosen above all else, these God has chosen in eternity, and
   their names together with their works are written from eternity in the
   living book of the Providence of God. But those who choose other
   things, and turn their inward faces away from God toward sin, and
   endure therein (even though their names were written and known of God
   because of the temporal righteousness which they had practised before),
   their names shall be blotted out and erased from the Book of Life
   because they did not persevere unto death, and they shall never more be
   able to taste of God, nor of any fruit which springs from virtue. And
   therefore we must needs observe ourselves with diligence, and adorn our
   turning towards God, from within with inward love, and from without
   with good works: thus we can await in hope and joy the judgment of God
   and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. But could we renounce
   ourselves, and all selfhood in our works, we should, with our bare and
   imageless spirit, transcend all things: and, without intermediary,
   should be led of the Spirit of God into the Nudity. And then we should
   feel the certainty that we are indeed the sons of God: for as many as
   are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God, says the
   Apostle St Paul.

   Nevertheless, you should know that all good and faithful men are the
   sons of God; for they are all born of the Spirit of God, and the Spirit
   of God lives in them. And He moves and stirs them--each according to
   his own capacity--to virtues and good works, wherein they are well
   pleasing to God. But because of the inequality of their adherence and
   their exercises, I call some the faithful servants of God and others I
   call His secret friends, and others again His hidden sons:
   nevertheless, they are all servants, friends, and sons, for they all
   serve and love and mean one God, and they live and work only by the
   free Spirit of God. And God permits and allows that His friends do and
   leave undone all those things which are not contrary to His
   commandments; and for those who are bound by the counsels of God, then
   this bond also is a commandment. And so no one is disobedient or
   contrary to God save he who does not keep His commandments; but all
   those things which God commands and forbids in Scripture or by Holy
   Church, or in our conscience, all these things we must do and leave
   undone, or else be disobedient to God, and lose His grace. But if we
   fall into venial sins, this is suffered both by God and by our reason,
   for we cannot wholly guard against them. And therefore such failings do
   not make us disobedient, for they do not drive out the grace of God nor
   our inward peace: nevertheless, we should always lament such lapses,
   how small soever they may be, and guard against them with all our
   might.

   And by these words I have explained to you what I said at the
   beginning: namely, that every man must needs be obedient in all things
   to God and to Holy Church and to his own conscience; for I do not wish
   that any should be unjustly offended by my words. And herewith I leave
   it even as I have said it.

   [80] "Een eenformich leven met Gode draghen." Here Ruysbroeck accepts
   in the most extreme form possible to a Catholic Christian the dangerous
   doctrine of the "deification" of the soul; its total transformation in
   God. We must, however, read such passages in the light thrown upon them
   by his distinct declarations in other places concerning the "invincible
   otherness" of God and the human spirit. Cf. infra cap. 10, where it is
   shown that this transmutation within the Divine Essence cannot and does
   not involve identity. Compare The Book of Truth, cap. 11. So, too, in
   The Twelve Béguines, cap. 14: "The spirit of man doth not become God,
   but is God-formed, and knows itself to be breadth and length and height
   and depth."

CHAPTER IX

  HOW WE MAY BECOME HIDDEN SONS OF GOD, AND ATTAIN TO THE GOD-SEEING LIFE

   But I still longed to know how we may become hidden sons of God, and
   may attain to the God-seeing life. And as to this I have apprehended
   the following. As it has been said before, we must always live and be
   watchful in all virtues, and beyond all virtues must forsake this life
   and die in God; for we must die to sin and be born of God into a life
   of virtue, and we must renounce ourselves and die in God into an
   eternal life. And as to this ensues the following instruction:

   If we are born of the Spirit of God, we are the sons of grace; and so
   our whole life is adorned with virtues. Thereby we overcome all that is
   contrary to God; for St John says, Whatsoever is born of God overcometh
   the world. In this birth all good men are sons of God. And the Spirit
   of God kindles and stirs each one of them in particular to those
   virtues and to those good works for which he is in readiness and of
   which he is capable. And so they please God all in common, and each in
   particular, according to the measure of his love and the nobleness of
   his exercise; nevertheless, they do not feel established nor possessed
   of God, nor assured of eternal life, for they may still turn away and
   fall into sin. And that is why I call them rather servants and friends,
   than sons. But when we transcend ourselves, and become in our ascent
   towards God, so simple that the naked love in the height can lay hold
   of us, where love enfolds love, above every exercise of virtue--that
   is, in our Origin, of Which we are spiritually born--then we cease, and
   we and all our selfhood die in God. And in this death we become hidden
   sons of God, and find a new life within us: and that is eternal life
   And of these sons, St Paul says: You are dead, and your life is hid
   with Christ in God. [81]

   Now understand, the explanation of this is as follows. In our approach
   to God, we must carry with us ourselves and all our works, as a
   perpetual sacrifice to God; and in the Presence of God, we must forsake
   ourselves and all our works, and, dying in love, go forth from all
   creatureliness into the superessential richness of God: there we shall
   possess God in an eternal death to ourselves. And that is why the
   Spirit of God says in the book of the Divine Secrets: Blessed are the
   dead which die in the Lord. Justly He calls them the blessed dead, for
   they remain eternally dead and lost to themselves in the fruitive Unity
   of God. And they die in love ever anew, through the indrawing
   transformation of that same Unity. Further, the Spirit of God says:
   They may rest from their labours, and their works do follow them. In
   the ordinary state of grace, when we are born of God into a ghostly and
   virtuous life, we carry our works before us, as an offering to God; but
   in the wayless state, where we die back into God in an eternal and
   blessed life, there our good works follow us, for they are one life
   with us. When we go towards God by means of the virtues, God dwells in
   us; but when we go out from ourselves and from all else, then we dwell
   in God. So soon as we have faith, hope and charity, we have received
   God, and He dwells in us with His grace, and He sends us out as His
   faithful servants, to keep His commandments. And He calls us in again
   as His secret friends, so soon as we are willing to follow His
   counsels; and He names us openly as His sons so soon as we live in
   opposition to the world. But if above all things we would taste God,
   and feel eternal life in ourselves, we must go forth into God with our
   feeling, above reason; and there we must abide, onefold, empty of
   ourselves, and free from images, lifted up by love into the simple
   bareness of our intelligence. For when we go out in love beyond and
   above all things, and die to all observation in ignorance and in
   darkness, then we are wrought and transformed through the Eternal Word,
   Who is the Image of the Father. In this idleness of our spirit, we
   receive the Incomprehensible Light, which enwraps us and penetrates us,
   as the air is penetrated by the light of the sun. And this Light is
   nothing else than a fathomless staring and seeing. What we are, that we
   behold; and what we behold, that we are: for our thought, our life, and
   our being are uplifted in simplicity, and made one with the Truth which
   is God. And therefore in this simple staring we are one life and one
   spirit with God: and this I call a contemplative life. [82] As soon as
   we cleave to God through love, we practise the better part; but when we
   gaze thus into our superessence, we possess God utterly. With this
   contemplation, there is bound up an exercise which is wayless, that is
   to say, a noughting of life; for, where we go forth out of ourselves
   into darkness and the abysmal Waylessness, there shines perpetually the
   simple ray of the Splendour of God, in which we are grounded, and which
   draws us out of ourselves into the superessence, and into the immersion
   of love. And with this sinking into love there is always bound up a
   practice of love which is wayless; for love cannot be lazy, but would
   search through and through and taste through and through the fathomless
   richness which lives in the ground of her being, and this is a hunger
   which cannot be appeased. But a perpetual striving after the
   unattainable--this is swimming against the stream. One can neither
   leave it nor grasp it, neither do without it nor attain it, neither be
   silent on it nor speak of it, for it is above reason and understanding,
   and it transcends all creatures; and therefore we can never reach nor
   overtake it. But we should abide within ourselves: there we feel that
   the Spirit of God is driving us and enkindling us in this restlessness
   of love. And we should abide above ourselves. And then we feel that the
   Spirit of God is drawing us out of ourselves and burning us to
   nothingness in His Selfhood; that is, in the Superessential Love with
   which we are one, and which we possess more deeply and more widely than
   all else.

   This possession is a simple and abysmal tasting of all good and of
   eternal life; and in this tasting we are swallowed up above reason and
   without reason, in the deep Quiet of the Godhead, which is never moved.
   That this is true we can only know by our own feeling, and in no other
   way. For how this is, or where, or what, neither reason nor practice
   can come to know: and therefore our ensuing exercise always remains
   wayless, that is, without manner. For that abysmal Good which we taste
   and possess, we can neither grasp nor understand; neither can we enter
   into it by ourselves or by means of our exercises. And so we are poor
   in ourselves, but rich in God; hungry and thirsty in ourselves, drunken
   and fulfilled in God; busy in ourselves, idle in God. And thus we shall
   remain throughout eternity. But without the exercise of love, we can
   never possess God; and whosoever thinks or feels otherwise is deceived.
   And thus we live wholly in God, where we possess our blessedness; and
   we live wholly in ourselves, where we exercise ourselves in love
   towards God. And though we live wholly in God and wholly in ourselves,
   yet it is but one life; but it is twofold and opposite according to our
   feeling, for poor and rich, hungry and satisfied, busy and idle, these
   things are wholly contrary to one another. Yet with this our highest
   honour is bound up, now and in eternity: for we cannot wholly become
   God and lose our created being, this is impossible. Did we, however,
   remain wholly in ourselves, sundered from God, we should be miserable
   and unblest. And therefore we should feel ourselves living wholly in
   God and wholly in ourselves; and between these two feelings we should
   find nothing else but the grace of God and the exercise of our love.
   For out of our highest feeling, the brightness of God shines into us,
   which teaches us truth, and moves us towards every virtue and in
   eternal love towards God. If we follow this brightness without pause,
   back into that Source from whence it comes forth, there we feel nothing
   but a quenching of our spirit and an irretrievable down-sinking into
   simple and fathomless love. Could we continue to dwell there with our
   simple gaze, we should always so feel it; for our immersion and
   transformation in God continues without ceasing in eternity, if we have
   gone forth from ourselves, and God is ours in the immersion of love.
   For if we possess God in the immersion of love--that is, if we are lost
   to ourselves--God is our own and we are His own: and we sink ourselves
   eternally and irretrievably in our own possession, which is God. This
   immersion is essential, and is closely bound up with the state of love:
   and so it continues whether we sleep or whether we wake, whether we
   know it or whether we know it not. And so it does not earn for us any
   new degree of reward; but it maintains us in the possession of God and
   of all that good which we have received. And this down-sinking is like
   a river, which without pause or turning back ever pours into the sea;
   since this is its proper resting-place. So likewise when we possess God
   alone, the down-sinking of our being, with the love that belongs to it
   flows forth, without return, into a fathomless experience which we
   possess, and which is our proper resting-place. Were we always simple,
   and could we always contemplate with the same recollection, we should
   always have the same experience. Now this immersion is above all
   virtues, and above every exercise of love; for it is nothing else than
   an eternal going out from ourselves, with a clear looking forward, into
   an otherness or difference towards which, outside ourselves, we tend as
   towards our blessedness. For we feel an eternal yearning toward
   something other than what we are ourselves. And this is the most inward
   and hidden distinction which we can feel between God and ourselves, and
   beyond it there is no difference any more. But our reason abides here
   with open eyes in the darkness, that is, in an abysmal ignorance; and
   in this darkness, the abysmal splendour remains covered and hidden from
   us, for its overwhelming unfathomableness blinds our reason. But it
   enwraps us in simplicity, and transforms us through its selfhood: and
   thus we are brought forth by God, out of our selfhood, into the
   immersion of love, in which we possess blessedness, and are one with
   God.

   When we are thus made one with God, there abides within us a quickening
   knowledge and an active love; for without our own knowledge, we cannot
   possess God; and without the practice of love, we cannot be united with
   God, nor remain one with Him. For if we could be blessed without our
   knowledge, then a stone, which has no knowledge, could also be blessed.
   Were I lord over all the world and knew it not, how would it profit me?
   And therefore we shall ever know and feel that we taste and possess;
   and this is testified by Christ Himself, where He speaks thus of us to
   His Father: This, he says, is life eternal, that they should know Thee,
   the only true God, and Jesus Christ, Whom Thou hast sent. And by this
   you may understand that our eternal life consists in knowledge with
   discernment.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [81] This "death in God" or total self-loss in the Divine Abyss was one
   of the favourite doctrines of the Friends of God, with whom Ruysbroeck
   appears to have been closely connected. Thus Tauler says-- "Everything
   depends on this: a fathomless sinking into a fathomless nothingness. .
   . . The Heavenly Father says, Thou shalt call Me Father, and shalt
   never cease to enter in; entering ever further, ever nearer, so as to
   sink ever deeper into an unknown and unnamed Abyss, and, above all
   ways, images and forms, above an powers, to lose thyself, deny thyself,
   and even unform thyself.' In this lost state, nothing is seen but a
   ground which rests upon itself: everywhere one being, one life. Thus,
   man may say, he becomes without knowledge, without love, without
   feeling. But this does not come from our natural qualities; but from
   the transformation of the created spirit by the Spirit of God, in the
   fathomless self-immersion of the created spirit, and its fathomless
   resignation." (Sermon on St Matthew.)

   [82] Compare St Augustine-- "In this seeing and beholding of Truth,
   which is the seventh and last stage of the soul (and not indeed a stage
   but a habitation to which she attains by these stages), what shall I
   say of the joys, of the fruition of the Supreme and True Good, of the
   perfect peace and breath of Eternity. (De Quantitate Animae, cap. 33.)

CHAPTER X

  HOW WE, THOUGH ONE WITH GOD, MUST ETERNALLY REMAIN OTHER THAN GOD

   Though I have said before that we are one with God and this is taught
   us by Holy Writ, yet now I will say that we must eternally remain other
   than God, and distinct from Him, and this too is taught us by Holy
   Writ. And we must understand and feel both within us, if all is to be
   right with us.

   And therefore I say further: that from the Face of God, or from our
   highest feeling, a brightness shines upon the face of our inward being,
   which teaches us the truth of love and of all virtues: and especially
   are we taught in this brightness to feel God and ourselves in four
   ways. First, we feel God in His grace; and when we apprehend this, we
   cannot remain idle. For like as the sun, by its splendour and its heat,
   enlightens and gladdens and makes fruitful the whole world, so God does
   to us through His grace: He enlightens and gladdens and makes fruitful
   all men who desire to obey Him. If, however, we would feel God within
   us, and have the fire of His love ever more burning within us, we must,
   of our own free will, help to kindle it in four ways: We must abide
   within ourselves, united with the fire through inwardness. And we must
   go forth from ourselves towards all good men with loyalty and brotherly
   love. And we must go beneath ourselves in penance, betaking ourselves
   to all good works, and resisting our inordinate lusts. And we must
   ascend above ourselves with the flame of this fire, through devotion,
   and thanksgiving, and praise, and fervent prayer, and must ever cleave
   to God with an upright intention and with sensible love. And thereby
   God continues to dwell in us with His grace; for in these four ways is
   comprehended every exercise which we can do with the reason, and in
   some wise, but without this exercise no one can please God. And he who
   is most perfect in this exercise, is nearest to God. And therefore it
   is needful for all men; and above it none can rise save the
   contemplative men. And thus, in this first way, we feel God within us
   through His grace, if we wish to belong to Him.

   Secondly: when we possess the God-seeing life, we feel ourselves to be
   living in God; and from out of that life in which we feel God in
   ourselves, there shines forth upon the face of our inward being a
   brightness which enlightens our reason, and is an intermediary between
   ourselves and God. And if we with our enlightened reason abide within
   ourselves in this brightness, we feel that our created life incessantly
   immerses itself in its eternal life. But when we follow the brightness
   above reason with a simple sight, and with a willing leaning out of
   ourselves, toward our highest life, there we experience the
   transformation of our whole selves in God; and thereby we feel
   ourselves to be wholly enwrapped in God.

   And, after this, there follows the third way of feeling; namely, that
   we feel ourselves to be one with God; for, through the transformation
   in God, we feel ourselves to be swallowed up in the fathomless abyss of
   our eternal blessedness, wherein we can nevermore find any distinction
   between ourselves and God. And this is our highest feeling, which we
   cannot experience in any other way than in the immersion in love. And
   therefore, so soon as we are uplifted and drawn into our highest
   feeling, all our powers stand idle in an essential fruition; but our
   powers do not pass away into nothingness, for then we should lose our
   created being. And as long as we stand idle, with an inclined spirit,
   and with open eyes, but without reflection, so long we can contemplate
   and have fruition. But, at the very moment in which we seek to prove
   and to comprehend what it is that we feel, we fall back into reason,
   and there we find a distinction and an otherness between ourselves and
   God, and find God outside ourselves in incomprehensibility.

   And hence the fourth way of distinction; which is, that we feel God and
   ourselves. Hereby we now find ourselves standing in the Presence of
   God; and the truth which we receive from the Face of God teaches us
   that God would be wholly ours and that He wills us to be wholly His.
   And in that same moment in which we feel that God would be wholly ours,
   there arises within us a gaping and eager craving which is so hungry
   and so deep and so empty that, even though God gave all that He could
   give, if he gave not Himself, we should not be appeased. For, whilst we
   feel that He has given Himself and yielded Himself to our untrammeled
   craving, that we may taste of Him in every way that we can desire--and
   of this we learn the truth in His sight--yet all that we taste, against
   all that we lack, is but like to a single drop of water against the
   whole sea: and this makes our spirit burst forth in fury and in the
   heat and the restlessness of love. For the more we taste, the greater
   our craving and our hunger; for the one is the cause of the other. And
   thus it comes about that we struggle in vain. For we feed upon His
   Immensity, which we cannot devour, and we yearn after His Infinity,
   which we cannot attain: and so we cannot enter into God nor can God
   enter into us, for in the untamed fury of love we are not able to
   renounce ourselves. And therefore the heat is so unmeasured that the
   exercise of love between ourselves and God flashes to and fro like the
   lightning in the sky; and yet we cannot be consumed in its ardour. And
   in this storm of love our activity is above reason and wayless; for
   love longs for that which is impossible to it, and reason teaches that
   love is in the right, but reason can neither counsel love nor dissuade
   her. For as long as we inwardly perceive that God would be ours, the
   goodness of God touches our eager craving: and therefrom springs the
   wildness of love, for the touch which pours forth from God stirs up
   this wildness, and demands our activity, that is, that we should love
   eternal love. But the inward-drawing touch draws us out of ourselves,
   and calls us to be melted and noughted in the Unity. And in this
   inward-drawing touch, we feel that God wills us to be His; and
   therefore, we must renounce ourselves and leave Him to work our
   blessedness. But where He touches us by the outpouring touch, He leaves
   us to ourselves, and makes us free, and sets us in His Presence, and
   teaches us to pray in the spirit and to ask in freedom, and shows us
   His incomprehensible riches in such manifold ways as we are able to
   grasp. For everything that we can conceive, wherein is consolation and
   joy, this we find in Him without measure. And therefore, when our
   feeling shows us that He with all these riches would be ours and dwell
   in us for ever more, then all the powers of the soul open themselves,
   and especially the desirous power; for all the rivers of the grace of
   God pour forth, and the more we taste of them, the more we long to
   taste; and the more we long to taste, the more deeply we press into
   contact with Him; and the more deeply we press into contact with God,
   the more the flood of His sweetness flows through us and over us; and
   the more we are thus drenched and flooded, the better we feel and know
   that the sweetness of God is incomprehensible and unfathomable. And
   therefore the prophet says: O taste, and see that the Lord is sweet.
   But he does not say how sweet He is, for God's sweetness is without
   measure and therefore we can neither grasp it nor swallow it. And this
   is also testified by the bride of God in the Song of Songs, where she
   says: I sat down under his shadow, with great delight, and his fruit
   was sweet to my taste.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XI

  OF THE GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE SAINTS AND THE HIGHEST
  BRIGHTNESS TO WHICH WE CAN ATTAIN IN THIS LIFE

   There is a great difference between the brightness of the saints and
   the highest brightness or enlightenment to which we may attain in this
   life. For it is only the shadow of God which enlightens our inward
   wilderness, but on the high mountains of the Promised Land there is no
   shadow: and yet it is one and the same Sun, and one radiance, which
   enlightens both our wilderness and the high mountains. But the state of
   the saints is transparent and shining, and therefore they receive the
   brightness without intermediary: but our state is still mortal and
   gross, and this sets up an obstacle which causes the shadow, which so
   darkens our understanding that we cannot know God and heavenly things
   so clearly as the saints can and do. For as long as we dwell in the
   shadow, we cannot see the sun in itself; but Now we see through a glass
   darkly, says St Paul. Yet the shadow is so enlightened by the sunshine
   that we can perceive the distinctions between all the virtues, and all
   the truth which is profitable to our mortal state. But if we would
   become one with the brightness of the Sun, we must follow love, and go
   out of ourselves into the Wayless, and then the Sun will draw us with
   our blinded eyes into Its own brightness, in which we shall possess
   unity with God. So soon we feel and understand ourselves thus, we are
   in that contemplative life which is within reach of our mortal state.

   The state of the Jews, according to the Old Testament, was cold and in
   the night, and they walked in darkness. And they Dwelt in the land of
   the shadow of death, says the prophet Isaias. The shadow of death came
   forth from original sin; and therefore they had all to endure the lack
   of God. But though our state in the Christian faith is but still in the
   cool and morning hour; yet for us the day has dawned. And therefore we
   shall walk in the light, and shall sit down in the shadow, of God; and
   His grace shall be an intermediary between ourselves and God. And,
   through it, we shall overcome all things, and shall die to all things,
   and shall pass without hindrance into the unity of God. But the state
   of the saints is warm and bright; for they live and walk in the
   noon-tide, and see with open and enlightened eyes the brightness of the
   Sun, for the glory of God flows through them and overflows in them. And
   each one according to the degree of his enlightenment, tastes and knows
   the fruits of all the virtues which have there been gathered together
   by all spirits. But that they taste and know the Trinity in the Unity,
   and the Unity in the Trinity, and know themselves united therewith,
   this is the highest and all-surpassing food which makes them drunken,
   and causes them to rest in Its Selfhood. And This it was that the bride
   in the Book of Love desired, when she said unto Christ: Tell me, O thou
   Whom my soul loveth, where Thou feedest, where Thou makest Thy flock to
   rest at noon, that is, in the light of glory, as St Bernard says; for
   all the food which is given to us here, in the morning hour and in the
   shadow, is but a foretaste of the food that is to come in the noon-tide
   of the glory of God.

   Yet the bride of our Lord gloried in having sat under the shadow of
   God, and that His fruit was sweet to her taste. Whenever we feel that
   God touches us from within, we taste of His fruit and His food: for His
   touch is His food. And His touch is both indrawing and outpouring, as I
   have said before. In His indrawing, we must be wholly His: thereby we
   learn to die and to behold. But in His outpouring He wills to be wholly
   ours: and then He teaches us to live in the riches of the virtues. In
   His indrawing-touch all our powers forsake us, and then we sit under
   His shadow, and His fruit is sweet to our taste, for the Fruit of God
   is the Son of God, Whom the Father brings forth in our spirit. This
   Fruit is so infinitely sweet to our taste that we can neither swallow
   It nor assimilate It, but It rather absorbs us into Itself and
   assimilates us with Itself. [83] And whenever this Fruit draws us
   inward and touches us, we abandon, forsake, and overcome all other
   things. And in this overcoming of all things, we taste of the hidden
   manna, which shall give us eternal life; for we receive the sparkling
   stone, of which I have spoken heretofore, in which our new names were
   written before the beginning of the world.

   This is the New name which no man knoweth but he that receiveth it. And
   whosoever feels himself to be for ever united with God, he possesses
   his name according to the measure of his virtues, and of his
   introversion, and of his union. And, that every one may obtain his name
   and possess it in eternity, the Lamb of God, that is, the manhood of
   our Lord, has delivered Itself up to death; and has opened for us the
   Book of Life, wherein are written all the names of the elect. And these
   names cannot be blotted out, for they are one with the Living Book,
   which is the Son of God. And that same death has broken for us the
   seals of the Book, so that all virtues may be fulfilled according to
   the eternal Providence of God. And so, in the measure in which each man
   can overcome himself, and can die to all things, he feels the touch of
   the Father drawing him inward; and then he tastes the sweetness of the
   Inborn Fruit, Which is the Son; and in this tasting the Holy Ghost
   teaches him that he is the heir of God. But in these three points no
   one is like to another in every respect. And therefore each one has
   been named separately, and his name is continually made new through new
   graces and new works of virtue. And therefore every knee shall bow
   before the Name of Jesus, for He has fought for our sake, and has
   conquered. And He has enlightened our darkness, and has fulfilled all
   the virtues in the highest degree. And so His name is lifted up above
   all other names, for He is the King and the Prince over all the elect.
   And in His name we are called and chosen, and adorned with grace and
   with virtues, and look for the glory of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [83] This, too, seems to have an Augustinian source-- "I heard Thy
   voice from on high crying unto me, I am the Food of the full-grown:
   grow, and thou shalt feed on Me; nor shalt thou change Me into thine
   own substance, as thou changest the food of the flesh, but thou shalt
   be changed into Mine.'" (Confessions, bk. vii. cap. 10.)
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XII

  OF THE TRANSFIGURATION OF CHRIST ON MOUNT THABOR

   And so, that the Name of Christ may be exalted and glorified in us, we
   should follow Him up the mountain of our bare intelligence, [84] even
   as Peter, James and John followed Him on to mount Thabor. Thabor means
   in our tongue an increase of light. So soon as we are like Peter in
   knowledge of truth, and like James in the overcoming of the world, and
   like John in fulness of grace possessing the virtues in righteousness;
   then Jesus brings us up on to the mountain of our bare intelligence to
   a hidden solitude, and reveals Himself to us in glory and in Divine
   brightness. And, in His name, His Father in heaven opens to us the
   living book of His Eternal Wisdom. And the Wisdom of God enfolds our
   bare vision and the simplicity of our spirit in a wayless, simple
   fruition of all good without distinction; and here there are indeed
   seeing and knowing, tasting and feeling, essence and life, having and
   being: and all this is one in our transcendence in God. And before this
   transcendence we are all set, each in his own particular way; and our
   heavenly Father, of His wisdom and goodness, endows each one in
   particular according to the nobility of his life and his practice. And
   therefore, if we ever remained with Jesus on mount Thabor, that is,
   upon the mountain of our bare thought, we should continually experience
   a growth of new light and new truth; for we should ever hear the voice
   of the Father, Who touches us, pouring forth with grace, and drawing us
   inward into the unity. The voice of the Father is heard by all who
   follow our Lord Jesus Christ, for He says of them all: "These are My
   chosen sons, in whom I am well pleased." And, through this good
   pleasure, each one receives grace, according to the measure and the way
   in which God is well-pleasing unto him. And therefrom, between our
   pleasure in God, and God's pleasure in us, there arises the practice of
   true love. And so each one tastes of his name and his office and the
   fruit of his exercise. And here all good men abide, hidden from those
   who live in the world; for these are dead before God and have no name,
   and therefore they can neither feel nor taste that which belongs to
   those who live indeed.

   The outpouring touch of God quickens us with life in the spirit, and
   fulfills us with grace, and enlightens our reason, and teaches us to
   know truth and to discern the virtues, and keeps us stable in the
   Presence of God, with such a great strength that we are able to endure
   all the tasting, all the feeling, and all the outpouring gifts of God
   without our spirits failing us. But the indrawing-touch of God demands
   of us, that we should be one with God, and go forth from ourselves, and
   die into blessedness, that is, into the Eternal Love Which embraces the
   Father and the Son in one fruition. And therefore when we have climbed
   with Jesus on to the mountain of our bare thought; and if, then, we
   follow Him with a single and simple gaze, with inward pleasure, and
   with fruitive inclination, we feel the fierce heat of the Holy Ghost,
   burning and melting us into the Unity of God. For when we are one with
   the Son, and lovingly return towards our Beginning, then we hear the
   voice of the Father, touching us and drawing us inward; for He says to
   all His chosen in His Eternal Word: This is My beloved Son, in Whom I
   am well pleased. For you should know that the Father with the Son, and
   the Son with the Father, have conceived an eternal satisfaction in
   regard to this: that the Son should take upon Himself our manhood, and
   die, and bring back all the chosen to their Beginning.

   And so soon as we are uplifted through the Son into our Origin, we hear
   the voice of the Father, which draws us inward, and enlightens us with
   eternal truth. And truth shows to us the wide-opened good-pleasure of
   God, in which all good-pleasure begins and ends. [85] There all our
   powers fail us, and we fall from ourselves into our wide-opened
   contemplation, and become all One and one All, in the loving embrace of
   the Threefold Unity. Whenever we feel this union, we are one being and
   one life and one blessedness with God. And there all things are
   fulfilled and all things are made new; for when we are baptized into
   the wide embrace of the Love of God, the joy of each one of us becomes
   so great and so special that he can neither think of nor care for the
   joy of anyone else; for then each one is himself a Fruition of Love,
   and he cannot and dare not seek for anything beyond his own.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [84] Ruysbroeck wrote "bloter ghedacten"; probably meaning the simple
   and undifferentiated consciousness, above the discursive reason, which
   is attained in high contemplative states: the "pure intellect" of
   Plotinus.

   [85] "Dat wide onploken behagene Gods." Compare note 53.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XIII

  HOW WE OUGHT TO HAVE FRUITION OF GOD

   If a man would have fruition of God, three things are needful thereto;
   these are, true peace, inward silence, and loving adherence.

   Whosoever would find true peace between himself and God must love God
   in such a way that he can, with a free heart, renounce for the glory of
   God everything which he does or loves inordinately, or which he
   possesses, or can possess, contrary to the glory of God. This is the
   first thing which is needful to all men.

   The second thing is an inward silence; that is, that a man should be
   empty and free from images of all things which he ever saw or of which
   he ever heard.

   The third thing is a loving adherence to God, and this adherence is
   itself fruition; for whosoever cleaves to God out of pure love, and not
   for his own profit, he enjoys God in truth, and feels that he loves God
   and that God loves him.

   There are still three other points, which are higher still, and which
   establish a man and make him able to enjoy and to feel God continually,
   if it be His good will to have it so.

   The first of these points is to rest in Him Whom one enjoys; that is,
   where love is overcome by the lover, and love is taken possession of by
   the lover, in bare Essential Love. There love has fallen in love with
   the lover, and each is all to the other, in possession and in rest.

   From this there follows the second: and this is called a falling asleep
   in God; that is, when the spirit immerses itself, and knows not how,
   nor where, nor in what it is.

   And therefrom follows the last point that can be put into words, that
   is, when the spirit beholds a Darkness into which it cannot enter with
   the reason. And there it feels itself dead and lost to itself, and one
   with God without difference and without distinction. And when it feels
   itself one with God, then God Himself is its peace and its enjoyment
   and its rest. And this is an unfathomable abyss wherein man must die to
   himself in blessedness, and must live again in virtues, whenever love
   and its stirring demand it. Lo! if you feel these six points within
   you, then you feel all that I have, or could have, said before. And
   introversion is as easy to you, and contemplation and fruition are as
   ready to you, as your life according to nature. And from these riches
   there comes that common life of which I promised to speak to you at the
   beginning.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XIV

  OF THAT COMMON LIFE WHICH COMES FROM THE CONTEMPLATION AND FRUITION OF GOD

   The man who is sent down by God from these heights into the world is
   full of truth and rich in all virtues. And he seeks not his own but the
   glory of Him Who has sent him. And hence he is just and truthful in all
   things, and he possesses a rich and a generous ground, which is set in
   the richness of God: and therefore he must always spend himself on
   those who have need of him; for the living fount of the Holy Ghost,
   which is his wealth, can never be spent. And he is a living and willing
   instrument of God, with which God works whatsoever He wills and
   howsoever He wills; and these works he reckons not as his own, but
   gives all the glory to God. And so he remains ready and willing to do
   in the virtues all that God commands, and strong and courageous in
   suffering and enduring all that God allows to befall him. And by this
   he possesses a universal life, for he is ready alike for contemplation
   and for action, and is perfect in both of them. And none can have this
   universal life save the God-seeing man; and none can contemplate and
   enjoy God save he who has within himself the six points, ordered as I
   have described heretofore. And therefore, all those are deceived who
   fancy themselves to be contemplative, and yet inordinately love,
   practice, or possess, some creaturely thing; or who fancy that they
   enjoy God before they are empty of images, or that they rest before
   they enjoy. All such are deceived; for we must make ourselves fit for
   God with an open heart, with a peaceful conscience, with naked
   contemplation, without hypocrisy, in sincerity and truth. And then we
   shall mount up from virtue unto virtue, and shall see God, and shall
   enjoy Him, and in Him shall become one with Him, in the way which I
   have shown to you. That this be done in all of us, so help us God.
   Amen.

                           THE BOOK OF SUPREME TRUTH
     __________________________________________________________________

PROLOGUE

   The prophet Samuel mourned for King Saul, though he knew well that God
   had rejected him and his issue from being kings in Israel: this was
   because of his pride, and because he did not obey God and the prophet
   who spoke in His name. We may also read in the Gospel, that the
   disciples of our Lord pleaded with Him for the Gentile woman of Canaan,
   to send her away, that is, to do unto her that which she desired; for
   she cried after Him. So likewise I might say that we must mourn for all
   such deceived men as think themselves to be kings in Israel; for they
   believe themselves to be lifted up above other good men, into a lofty
   and God-seeing life. And yet they are proud and wittingly and willingly
   disobedient to God and the law and the Holy Church and every virtue.
   And like as Saul rent the mantle of the prophet Samuel, they endeavour
   to rend asunder the unity of the Christian faith, and all true doctrine
   and virtuous life. Whosoever persist herein, they are separated and
   shut out from the kingdom of eternal contemplation, even as Saul was
   shut out from the kingdom of Israel. But that humble little woman of
   Canaan, though she was Gentile and a stranger, had faith and hope in
   God, and acknowledged and confessed her littleness before Christ and
   His apostles: and so she received grace and health and all that she
   desired. For God exalts the humble, and fills them with grace and all
   virtues; and He resists the proud, and these remain empty of all good.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER I

  WHEREFORE THIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN

   Certain of my friends have desired and besought me, that I should show
   and make plain in a few words and according to my best cunning, shortly
   and clearly, how I understand and feel the truth of all the highest
   teachings that I have written before; so that none should take offense
   at my words, but everyone should profit by them. And this I willingly
   consent to do. I will, with God's help, teach the humble who love
   virtue and truth; and, with the same words, I shall inwardly vex and
   darken the false and the proud: for to these my words will be
   displeasing and contrary, and this the proud cannot endure, but it
   provokes them to anger.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER II

  A SHORT REPETITION OF ALL THE HIGHEST TEACHINGS WRITTEN BY THE AUTHOR

   Behold, I have said this: that the contemplative lover of God is united
   with God through means, and also without means, and thirdly, without
   difference or distinction; and this I find in nature, and in grace, and
   also in glory. Further I have said that never creature may be or become
   so holy that it loses its created being and becomes God; even the soul
   of our Lord Jesus Christ shall ever remain creature, and other than
   God. Yet, none the less, we must all be lifted up above ourselves into
   God, and become one spirit with God in love; and then we shall be
   blessed. And therefore mark my words and my meaning, and understand me
   aright as to what is the condition and the way to our eternal
   blessedness.

CHAPTER III

  OF THE UNION THROUGH MEANS

   And next, I will say that all good men are united with God through
   means. These means are the grace of God, and the sacraments of Holy
   Church, and the Divine virtues, faith, hope and charity, and a virtuous
   life according to the commandments of God; and to these there belongs a
   death to sin and to the world and to every inordinate lust of nature.
   And through these, we remain united with Holy Church, that is, with all
   good men; and with these, we obey God, and are one will with Him, even
   as an orderly convent is united with its Superior: and without this
   union none can please God nor be saved. Whosoever keeps this union
   through these means unto the end of his life, he shall be one of those
   of whom Christ says unto His Father in heaven in the Gospel of St John:
   Father, I will that they also whom Thou hast given Me be with Me where
   I am: that they may behold My glory which Thou hast given Me. And in
   another place He says that His servants shall sit down to meat--that
   is, in the richness and the fulness of those virtues which they have
   exercised--and He will go one to another and will minister unto them of
   His glory which He has achieved. And He will generously impart and
   reveal to His beloved, to each one specially and separately--more or
   less according as he is worthy of it and can lay hold of it--the
   loftiness of His glory and honour which He alone has earned by the
   merits of His life and His death. Thus all saints shall be forever with
   Christ, each in his own order and in the degree of glory which he has
   earned through God's help by his works. And Christ, according to His
   manhood shall be set above all saints, and above all angels, as a
   prince of all glory and all honour; the which pertain to His manhood
   alone above all creatures. Behold, thus you may understand how we are
   united with God through means, both here in grace and hereafter in
   glory. But there is a great distinction and a great difference in these
   means, and this is true both as regards life and reward, as I have told
   you. And this was well understood by St Paul, when he said that he had
   A desire to depart and to be with Christ. But he did not say that he
   had a desire to be Christ Himself or God; as is done by some
   unbelieving and perverse men, who say that they have no God, but that
   they are so wholly dead to themselves, and united with God, that they
   have themselves become God.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER IV

  OF THE MEN WHO PRACTISE A FALSE VACANCY

   Behold, such folk, by means of a onefold simplification and a natural
   tendency, are turned in upon the bareness of their own being; and
   therefore they think eternal life is and shall be nought else but an
   enduring state of beatitude, without distinction in order in holiness
   or in reward. Yea, all such are so deep in error that they say that the
   Persons shall pass away into the Godhead, and that nought else shall
   remain in eternity than the essential substance of the Godhead; and
   that all blessed spirits shall be so simply absorbed with God in the
   Essential Blessedness that nothing shall remain beside it, neither
   willing nor working, nor the discerning knowledge of any creature
   whatsoever. Behold, these men have gone astray into the vacant and
   blind simplicity of their own being, and they seek for blessedness in
   bare nature; for they are so simply and so idly united with the bare
   essence of their souls, and with that wherein God always is, that they
   have neither zeal, nor cleaving to God, neither from without, nor from
   within. For in the highest part into which they have entered, they feel
   nothing but the simplicity of their own proper being, depending upon
   the Being of God. And the onefold simplicity which they there possess,
   they take to be God, because they find a natural rest therein. And so
   they think themselves to be God in their simple ground; for they lack
   true faith, hope and charity. And, because of the naked emptiness which
   they feel and possess, they say that they are without knowledge and
   without love, and are exempt from the virtues. And so they endeavour to
   live without heeding their conscience, what wickedness soever they
   commit. And they are careless of the sacraments, and of all virtues,
   and of all the practices of Holy Church, and believe that they have no
   need of them: for they fancy in their folly that they have passed
   beyond all these things, but imperfect men, they say, have need of
   them. And some men have become so accustomed to and deep-rooted in this
   simplification that they would know and heed as little of all the works
   which God has wrought, and all that Scripture teaches, as though not
   one line had ever been written; for they believe themselves to have
   found and to possess that for the sake of which all Scriptures have
   been made, namely, the blind essential rest which they feel. But in
   fact they have lost God and all the ways which may lead to Him; for
   they have no more inwardness, nor more devotion, nor holy practices,
   than a dead beast has. Yet they sometimes approach the sacraments, and
   at times they quote the Scriptures, that thus they may the better
   dissimulate and cover themselves; and they like to take some dark
   saying of Scripture, which they can falsely turn to their own sense, so
   that they may please other simple men, and may draw them into the false
   vacancy which they themselves feel. Behold, these folk think themselves
   wise and subtle beyond any one else, and yet they are the most coarse
   and crude of all men living; for that which even Pagans and Jews and
   bad Christians, learned and unlearned, find and understand through
   their natural reason, these wretched men neither can nor will attain.
   You may cross yourselves against the devil, but beware earnestly of
   these perverted men, and take care lest you should not recognise them
   in their words and works. For they would teach, and be taught of none;
   they would reprove, and be reproved of none; they would command, and
   obey none. They would oppress others, but no one may oppress them; they
   wish to say whatever they like, but will endure no contradiction; they
   recognise only their own self-will and are subject to no one; and this
   they take to be ghostly freedom. They practise the liberty of the
   flesh, for they give to the body whatsoever it lusts after; and this
   they take to be natural freedom. They have unified themselves in a
   blind and dark vacancy of their own being; and there, they think, they
   are one with God, and they take this for the Eternal Blessedness. And
   they have entered into this, and have taken possession of it, through
   self-will and their natural tendency; and therefore they imagine
   themselves to be set above the law and above the commandments of God
   and Holy Church. For, above that essential rest which they possess,
   they feel neither God nor any otherness; for the Divine light has not
   shone into their dimness. And this is because they have neither sought
   after it through active love nor through supernatural freedom. And thus
   they have lost truth and every virtue, and have fallen into a perverted
   unlikeness; for they make it a part of the highest holiness that a man
   should yield to all that concerns his nature, and be without restraint,
   so that he may abide, with an inclined spirit, in vacancy; and that as
   regards the lusts of the flesh whenever they move him, he should turn
   outwards, that the flesh being satisfied, he may quickly escape from
   the image and may return once more unencumbered into the bare vacancy
   of his spirit. Lo! this is a fruit of hell, which grows from their
   unbelief; and therewith shall unbelief be nourished even in death. For,
   when the time has come and their nature is weighed down with bitter woe
   and the sorrow of death, then they are filled with images and unrest
   and inward fear; and they lose their vacant introversion in quietude,
   and fall into such despair that none can console them, and they die
   like mad dogs. And their vacancy shall bring them no reward, and those
   who worked wicked works, and died in them shall go to the eternal
   flames, as our faith teaches.

   I have shown to you the evil and the good side by side, so that you may
   so much the better understand the good and be able to guard against the
   evil. You shall abhor and fly from such folk, for, how holy soever they
   seem in their conduct, in works, in dress and demeanour, they are the
   mortal enemies of your soul. For they are the devil's ministers, and
   the most noxious of all who now live to simple and unlearned men of
   good-will. But I will leave this subject, and go back again to the
   matter with which I first began.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER V

  OF THE UNION WITHOUT MEANS

   You may remember that I showed heretofore how all saints and all good
   men are united with God through means. Now I will further show to you
   how they are all united with God without means. But in this life there
   are but few who are meet for this, and sufficiently enlightened to feel
   and understand it. And therefore, whosoever wishes to find and to feel
   within himself those three unions of which I am going to speak, he must
   live entirely and wholly in God, so that he may satisfy and be amenable
   to the grace and the stirring of God, in all virtues and inward
   exercises. And he must be lifted up through love, and die in God to
   himself and all his works; so that he yields himself up with all his
   powers, and submits to the transformation through the incomprehensible
   Truth which is God Himself. And to that end it is needful that living
   he should go forth in the virtues, and dying should enter into God. And
   in these two things his perfect life consists; and these two are joined
   together within him like matter and form, like body and soul. [86] And
   as he exercises himself in them so he becomes clear in understanding,
   and rich and overflowing in feeling; for he has joined himself to God
   with uplifted powers, with true intention, with his heart's desire,
   with ceaseless craving, with the living ardour of his spirit and of his
   nature. And since he thus exercises himself and keeps himself in the
   Presence of God, love overpowers him: in whatsoever manner he moves, he
   is ever growing in love and in all virtues. But love always moves each
   man according to the profit and the ability of each.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [86] It will be seen that this is another aspect of that balanced life
   of action and fruition described in The Adornment of the Spiritual
   Marriage, which parallels on the human plane the essentially static and
   personally dynamic aspects of the Divine life. Compare note 66.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VI

  OF HEAVENLY WEAL AND HELLISH WOE

   The most profitable stirrings which such a man can feel, and for which
   he is best fitted, are heavenly weal and hellish woe, and the ability
   to respond to these two with fit and proper works. For heavenly weal
   lifts a man up above all things into an untrammelled power of praising
   and loving God in every way that his heart and his soul desire. After
   this comes hellish woe, and casts him down into a misery, and into a
   lack of all the comfort and consolation that he experienced before. In
   this woe, weal sometimes shows itself, and brings with it a hope which
   none can gainsay. And then the man falls back again into a despair in
   which he can find no consolation. When a man feels God within himself
   with rich and full grace, this I call heavenly health; for then he is
   wise and clear of understanding, rich and outflowing with heavenly
   teachings, ardent and generous in charity, drunken and overflowing with
   joy, strong in feeling, bold and ever ready in all the things which he
   knows to be well pleasing to God; and such-like things without number,
   which may only be known by those who feel them. But when the scale of
   love goes down, and God hides Himself with all His graces, then the man
   falls back into dereliction and torment and dark misery, as though he
   should never more recover: and then he feels himself to be nought else
   but a poor sinner, who knows little or nothing of God. He scorns every
   consolation that creatures may give him; and the taste and consolation
   of God he does not receive. And then his reason says within him: Where
   is now thy God? What hath become of all that thou didst receive from
   God? Then his Tears are his meat day and night, as the Prophet says.
   Now if that man is to recover from this misery, he must observe and
   feel that he does not belong to himself, but to God; and therefore he
   must freely abandon his own will to the will of God, and must leave God
   to work in him in time and in eternity. So soon as he can do this, with
   untroubled heart, and with a free spirit, at that very moment he
   recovers his health, and brings heaven into hell, and hell into heaven.
   For howsoever the scales of love go up and down, all things to him are
   even or alike. For whatsoever love gives or takes away, he who abandons
   himself and loves God finds peace in all. For his spirit remains free
   and unmoved, who lives in all pains without rebellion; and he is able
   to feel the unmediated union with God. For he has achieved the union
   through means by the richness of his virtues. And after this, because
   he is one aim and one will with God, he feels God within himself
   together with the fulness of His grace, as the quickening health of his
   being and all his works.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VII

  SHOWING WHEREFORE ALL GOOD MEN DO NOT ATTAIN TO THE UNMEDIATED UNION WITH GOD

   But now you may ask me why all good men do not attain to feel this. Now
   listen and I will tell you the why and the wherefore. They do not
   respond to the stirring of God with a forsaking of themselves, and so
   they do not abide with quickening fervour before the Presence of God;
   and also they are not careful of heart in their inward
   self-examination. And therefore they always remain more outward and
   manifold than inward and simple, and they work their works more from
   good custom than from inward feeling. And they care more for particular
   methods and the greatness and multiplicity of good works than for the
   intention and love towards God. And so they remain outward and manifold
   of heart, and are not aware of how God lives in them with the fulness
   of grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VIII

  SHOWING HOW THE INWARD MAN SHOULD EXERCISE HIMSELF, THAT HE MAY BE UNITED WITH
  GOD WITHOUT MEANS

   But now I will tell you how the inward man, who has health amidst all
   miseries, should feel himself to be one with God without means. When
   such a quickened man rises up, with his whole being and all his powers,
   and joins himself to God with life-giving and active love, then he
   feels that his love is, in its ground, where it begins and ends,
   fruitive and without ground. If he then wishes to penetrate further,
   with his active love into that fruitive love: then, all the powers of
   his soul must give way, and they must suffer and patiently endure that
   piercing Truth and Goodness which is God's self. For, as the air is
   penetrated by the brightness and heat of the sun, and iron is
   penetrated by fire; so that it works through fire the works of fire,
   since it burns and shines like the fire, and so likewise it can be said
   of the air--for, if the air had understanding, it could say: "I
   enlighten and brighten the whole world"--yet each of these keeps its
   own nature. For the fire does not become iron and the iron does not
   become fire, though their union is without means; for the iron is
   within the fire and the fire within the iron; and so also the air is in
   the sunshine and the sunshine in the air [87] . So likewise is God in
   the being of the soul; and whenever the soul's highest powers are
   turned inward with active love, they are united with God without means,
   in a simple knowledge of all truth, and in an essential feeling and
   tasting of all good. This simple knowing and feeling of God is
   possessed in essential love, and is practised and preserved through
   active love. And therefore it is accidental to our powers through the
   dying introversion in love; but it is essential to our being, and
   always abides within it. And therefore we must perpetually turn inwards
   and be renewed in love, if we would seek out love through love. And
   this is taught us by St John, where he says: He that dwelleth in love
   dwelleth in God and God in him. And though this union of the loving
   spirit with God is without means, yet there is here a great
   distinction, for the creature never becomes God, nor does God ever
   become the creature; as I explained to you heretofore in the example of
   the iron wnd the fire. And if material things, which have been made by
   God, may thus be united without means; so much the more may He,
   whenever such is His pleasure, unite himself with his beloved, if they,
   through His grace, submit to it and make themselves ready for it. And
   so in such an inward man, whom God has adorned with virtues, and, above
   that, has lifted up into a contemplative life, there is no intermediary
   between himself and God in his highest introversion but his enlightened
   reason and his active love. And through these two things, he has an
   adherence to God; and this is "becoming one with God," says St Bernard.
   But above reason, and above active love, he is lifted up into a naked
   contemplation, and dwells without activity in essential love. And there
   he is one love and one spirit with God, as I said heretofore. In this
   essential love through the unity which he has essentially with God, he
   infinitely transcends his understanding; and this is a life common to
   all God-seeing men. For in this transcendence such a man is able to see
   in one sight--if it be God's pleasure to show it to him--all the
   creatures in heaven and on earth, with the distinction of their lives
   and their rewards. But before the Infinity of God, he must yield, and
   must follow after It essentially and without end; for This no creature,
   not even the soul of our Lord Jesus Christ, which yet received the
   highest union above all other creatures, can either comprehend or
   overtake.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [87] This ancient simile for the union of the soul with God is
   constantly used by Ruysbroeck. It goes back at least to the fourth
   century A.D.; being found in the sermons of St Macarius. Ruysbroeck
   probably took it from St Bernard (De diligendo Deo, cap. 10), or
   possibly Richard of St Victor (De Quatuor Gradibus Violentae
   Charitatis).
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER IX

  OF THE INWARD WORKING OF GOD'S GRACE

   Behold, this Eternal Love, which lives within the spirit, and with
   which it is united without means, gives its light and its grace to all
   the powers of the soul; and becomes thereby the cause of all the
   virtues. For the grace of God touches the highest powers of the soul,
   and from this touch there spring charity and the knowledge of truth,
   the love of all righteousness, the practice of the counsels of God
   according to discretion, freedom from images, the overcoming of all
   things without effort, and the death into the Unity through love. As
   long as a man can maintain himself in this exercise, he is able to
   contemplate, and to feel the union without means; and he feels the
   touch of God within himself, which is a renewal of grace and all
   virtues. You must further know that the grace of God also pours forth
   even through the lowest powers, and touches a man's heart; and from
   this there comes forth a heart-felt love towards God and a sensible joy
   in Him; and the love and delight pierce through heart and senses,
   through flesh and blood, and the whole bodily nature, and cause a
   pressure and restlessness in all his members, so that he is often at
   his wit's end. For he feels like a man full of wine, who is no longer
   master of himself. And from this there come many a strange state,
   wherein men of tender heart cannot well govern themselves. Sometimes
   through impatient longing, they lift up their heads and gaze with
   wide-opened eyes towards heaven; now joying, now weeping; now singing,
   now crying; now in weal, now in woe, and often both together; running
   and jumping, laughing, clapping their hands, kneeling, bowing down: and
   many other like gestures are seen in them. So long as a man remains
   thus, and lifts himself up with an open heart towards those riches of
   God which live in his spirit, he feels ever anew the stirring of God,
   and the impatience of love; and then all these things are renewed in
   him. And so this man through this bodily feeling may sometimes pass
   into a ghostly feeling which is according to reason; and through this
   ghostly feeling, he may pass into a godly feeling, which is above
   reason; and, through this godly feeling, he may drown himself in an
   unchangeable and beatific feeling. This feeling is our superessential
   blessedness, which is a fruition of God and all His beloved: and this
   blessedness is that Dark Quiet which ever abides in idleness. To God it
   is essential, and to all creatures superessential. And there we may
   behold how the Persons give place and abide in the Essential Love, that
   is, in the Fruitive Unity and yet they dwell for ever, according to
   Their personal nature, in the working of the Trinity.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER X

  OF THE MUTUAL CONTENTMENT OF THE DIVINE PERSONS, AND THE MUTUAL CONTENTMENT
  BETWEEN GOD AND GOOD MEN

   And so you may perceive that the Divine Nature eternally works
   according to the Persons, and is eternally idle and wayless according
   to the simplicity of Its Essence. All therefore that God has chosen and
   laid hold of with eternal personal love, has already been essentially
   and fruitively possessed of Him in unity with essential love. For the
   Divine Persons are enfolded within the Unity in a mutual embrace in an
   eternal contentment, in abysmal active love. And this is perpetually
   renewed in the lifegiving life of the Trinity; for here there takes
   place a perpetual new birth in new knowledge new contentment and new
   outbreathing; in a new embrace with new torrents of Eternal Love. In
   this contentment all the chosen are enfolded: angels and men, from the
   first even to the last. Upon this contentment depend heaven and earth,
   and life and being and the activity and preservation of all creatures,
   save only the tendency to turn from God in sin: this comes from the
   wilful and blind wickedness of the creatures. From the Divine
   contentment grace and glory and all gifts pour forth in heaven and on
   earth, and into each creature separately, according to its needs and
   its receptivity. For God's grace is made ready for all men, and awaits
   the conversion of every sinner, and whenever a sinner, urged by grace,
   renounces himself and will call upon God with faith, he finds pardon.
   And likewise, whosoever through grace with loving contentment turns
   towards the Eternal Contentment of God, he is enwrapped and embraced in
   the abysmal love which is God Himself. And thereby he is perpetually
   renewed in love and in the virtues; for, between our contentment in God
   and God's contentment in us there abides an activity of love and of
   eternal life. But God has eternally loved us and established us within
   His contentment, and if we rightly observe this, our love and our
   contentment shall be wakened anew. For, in the mutual relations of the
   Persons in the Godhead, this contentment perpetually renews itself, in
   a new gushing forth of love, in an ever new embrace within the Unity.
   And this takes place beyond Time; that is, without before and after, in
   an eternal NOW. For, in this embrace in the Unity, all things are
   consummated; and in the gushing forth of love, all things are wrought;
   and in the life-giving and fruitful Nature lie the power and
   possibilities of all things. For in the life-giving and fruitful
   Nature, the Son is in the Father, and the Father in the Son, and the
   Holy Ghost in Both. For It is a life-giving and fruitful Unity, which
   is the home and the beginning of all life and of all becoming. And so
   all creatures are therein, beyond themselves, one Being and one Life
   with God, as in their Eternal Origin. But in the precession of the
   different Persons, the Son proceeds from the Father, and the Holy Ghost
   from Both: and it is there that God has made and ordained all creatures
   according to their proper being, and has re-made man, through His grace
   and His death, inasmuch as he cleaves to Him. And He has adorned His
   own with love and with the virtues; and has turned back with them,
   towards His Origin.

   There the Father and the Son and all the beloved are enfolded and
   embraced in the bonds of love; that is, in the unity of the Holy Ghost.
   And this is that same unity which is fruitful in the outgoing activity
   of the Persons, and forms in Their return an eternal bond of love which
   shall never be untied: and all who know themselves to be bound up in it
   shall be blessed throughout eternity, and they are rich in virtue, and
   clear in contemplation, and simple in fruitive rest. For in their
   introversion, the Love of God is revealed to them, pouring forth with
   all good, and drawing back again into the Unity, and above all being
   and beyond all conditions abiding in eternal rest. And so they are all
   united with God, through means, and without means, and also without
   distinction.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XI

  HOW GOOD MEN IN THEIR CONTEMPLATION HAVE THE LOVE OF GOD BEFORE THEM, AND HOW
  THEY ARE LIFTED UP INTO GOD

   They have the Love of God before them in their inward seeing, as a
   common good pouring forth through heaven and earth; and they feel the
   Holy Trinity inclined towards them, and within them, with fulness of
   grace. And therefore they are adorned without and within with all the
   virtues, with holy practices and with good works. And thus they are
   united with God through Divine grace and their own holy lives. And
   because they have abandoned themselves to God in doing, in leaving
   undone, and in suffering, they have steadfast peace and inward joy,
   consolation and savour, of which the world cannot partake; neither any
   dissembler, nor the man who seeks and means himself more than the glory
   of God. Moreover, those same inward and enlightened men have before
   them in their inward seeing whenever they will, the Love of God as
   something drawing or urging them into the Unity; for they see and feel
   that the Father with the Son through the Holy Ghost, embrace Each Other
   and all the chosen, and draw themselves back with eternal love into the
   unity of Their Nature. Thus the Unity is ever drawing to itself and
   inviting to itself everything that has been born of It, either by
   nature or by grace. And therefore, too, such enlightened men are, with
   a free spirit, lifted up above reason into a bare and imageless vision,
   wherein lives the eternal indrawing summons of the Divine Unity; and,
   with an imageless and bare understanding, they pass through all works,
   and all exercises, and all things, until they reach the summit of their
   spirits. There, their bare understanding is drenched through by the
   Eternal Brightness, even as the air is drenched through by the
   sunshine. And the bare, uplifted will is transformed and drenched
   through by abysmal love, even as iron is by fire. And the bare,
   uplifted memory feels itself enwrapped and established in an abysmal
   Absence of Image. And thereby the created image is united above reason
   in a threefold way with its Eternal Image, which is the origin of its
   being and its life; and this origin is preserved and possessed,
   essentially and eternally, through a simple seeing in an imageless
   void: and so a man is lifted up above reason in a threefold manner into
   the Unity, and in a onefold manner into the Trinity. Yet the creature
   does not become God, for the union takes place in God through grace and
   our homeward-turning love: and therefore the creature in its inward
   contemplation feels a distinction and an otherness between itself and
   God. And though the union is without means, yet the manifold works
   which God works in heaven and on earth are nevertheless hidden from the
   spirit. For though God gives Himself as He is, with clear discernment,
   He gives Himself in the essence of the soul, where the powers of the
   soul are simplified above reason, and where, in simplicity, they suffer
   the transformation of God. [88] There all is full and overflowing, for
   the spirit feels itself to be one truth and one richness and one unity
   with God. Yet even here there is an essential tending forward, and
   therein is an essential distinction between the being of the soul and
   the Being of God; and this is the highest and finest distinction which
   we are able to feel.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [88] "Hi gheeft hem in dat wesen der sielen, dar der sielen crachten,
   boven redene, gheenvoldicht sijn en ghedaghen die overforminghen Gods
   eenvoldigher wijs." Reason, will and love must here be fused in one
   simple state, in order that they may apprehend the Unity in which an
   wisdom, love and will are resumed. This doctrine of self-simplification
   was well understood by the Platonic mystics and has passed from them
   into the Christian tradition. Thus Plotinus says, "The soul must ascend
   to the principle which is in herself, and become one instead of many,
   in order that she may contemplate the Principle of all things, and the
   One." (On the Good, or the One.)
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XII

  OF THE HIGHEST UNION, WITHOUT DIFFERENCE OR DISTINCTION

   And after this there follows the union without distinction. For you
   must apprehend the Love of God not only as an outpouring with all good,
   and as drawing back again into the Unity; but it is also, above all
   distinction, an essential fruition in the bare Essence of the Godhead.
   And in consequence of this enlightened men have found within themselves
   an essential contemplation which is above reason and without reason,
   and a fruitive tendency which pierces through every condition and all
   being, and through which they immerse themselves in a wayless abyss of
   fathomless beatitude, where the Trinity of the Divine Persons possess
   Their Nature in the essential Unity. Behold, this beatitude is so
   onefold and so wayless that in it every essential gazing, tendency, and
   creaturely distinction cease and pass away. For by this fruition, all
   uplifted spirits are melted and noughted in the Essence of God, Which
   is the superessence of all essence. There they fall from themselves
   into a solitude and an ignorance which are fathomless; there all light
   is turned to darkness; there the three Persons give place to the
   Essential Unity, and abide without distinction in fruition of essential
   blessedness. This blessedness is essential to God, and superessential
   to all creatures; for no created essence can become one with God's
   Essence and pass away from its own substance. For so the creature would
   become God, which is impossible; for the Divine Essence can neither wax
   nor wane, nor can anything be added to It or taken from It. Yet all
   loving spirits are one fruition and one blessedness with God without
   distinction; for that beatific state, which is the fruition of God and
   of all His beloved, is so simple and onefold that therein neither
   Father, nor Son, nor Holy Ghost, is distinct according to the Persons,
   neither is any creature. But all enlightened spirits are here lifted up
   above themselves into a wayless fruition, which is an abundance beyond
   all the fulness that any creature has ever received or shall ever
   receive. For there all uplifted spirits are, in their superessence, one
   fruition and one beatitude with God without distinction; and there this
   beatitude is so onefold that no distinction can enter into it. And this
   was prayed for by Christ when He besought His Father in heaven that all
   His beloved might be made perfect in one, even as He is one with the
   Father through the Holy Ghost: even so He prayed and besought that He
   in us and we in Him and His heavenly Father might be one in fruition
   through the Holy Ghost. And this I think the most loving prayer which
   Christ ever made for our blessedness.

CHAPTER XIII

  OF THE THREEFOLD PRAYER OF CHRIST, THAT WE MIGHT BE ONE WITH GOD

   But you should also observe that His prayer, as it has been written by
   St John in this same Gospel, was threefold. For He prayed that we might
   be with Him, that we might behold the glory which His Father had given
   Him. And therefore I said at the beginning that all good men are united
   with God by means of Divine grace and their own virtuous life; for the
   love of God is always pouring into us with new gifts, and whosoever is
   aware of this is fulfilled with new virtues and holy exercises and with
   all good, in the way that I told you heretofore: and this union through
   the fulness of grace and glory, in body and soul, begins here below and
   shall endure throughout eternity.

   Further, Christ prayed thus, that He might be in us and we in Him. This
   we find in the Gospel, in many places. And this is the union without
   means; for the Love of God is not only outpouring, but it also draws us
   inwards, into the Unity. And those who feel and are aware of this,
   become inward and enlightened men, and their highest powers are
   uplifted, above all exercises, into their naked being: and there, above
   reason, the powers become simplified in their essence, and so they are
   full and overflowing. For in that simplicity, the spirit finds itself
   united with God without means; and this union, with the exercise which
   belongs to it, shall endure eternally, as I have told you heretofore.

   Further, Christ uttered His most sublime prayer, namely, that His
   beloved might be made perfect in one, as He is one with the Father: not
   one as He is with the Father one single Divine Substance, for this is
   impossible to us; but so one, and in such a unity, as He is one
   fruition and one beatitude with the Father without distinction in
   Essential Love. Those who are thus united with God in this threefold
   way, in them the prayer of Christ has been fulfilled.


   These with God shall ebb and flow,

   Having and joying, they shall empty go;

   They shall both work and passively endure,

   And in their superessence rest secure.

   They shall go out and in, and find their food,

   And, drunk with love, in radiant darkness sleep in God.

   Many more words I should like to say here, but those who possess this
   have no need of them: and he to whom it has been shown, and who cleaves
   with love to Love, he shall be taught the whole truth by Love itself.
   But those who turn outwards, and would find consolation in outward
   things, do not feel this; and, even though I should say much more of
   it, yet they would not understand. For those who give themselves wholly
   to outward works, or those who are idle in inward passivity, shall
   never be able to understand it. Now although reason and all bodily
   feelings must here give place and yield to the faith and contemplation
   of the spirit, [89] and to those things which are above reason; yet
   reason and also the life of the senses continue to abide in their
   place, and cannot pass away, any more than the nature of man can pass
   away. And further, though the gazing and tendency of the spirit towards
   God must give place to fruition in simplicity; yet this gazing and this
   tendency continue to exist in their place. [90] For this is the inmost
   life of the spirit; and, in the enlightened and uplifted man, the life
   of the senses adheres to the spirit. And so his sensual powers are
   joined to God by heart-felt love, and his nature is fulfilled with all
   good; and he feels that his ghostly life adheres to God without means.
   And thereby his highest powers are uplifted to God in eternal love, and
   drenched through by Divine truth, and established in imageless freedom.
   And so he is filled with God, and overflowing without measure. In this
   inundation there comes to pass the essential outpouring or immersion in
   the superessential Unity; and this is the union without distinction, of
   which I have often told you. For in the superessence all our ways end.
   If we will go with God upon the highway of love, we shall rest with Him
   eternally and without end: and thus we shall eternally go forth towards
   God and enter into Him and rest in Him.

   [89] The Flemish word "instaerne," which Ruysbroeck here uses, conveys
   the idea of an absorbed inward gazing, for which we have no exact
   expression in English.

   [90] "Staende in syn abijt." This phrase has puzzled all translators,
   from Surius onwards. Taken with its context, it seems to mean that the
   self's ascent to the heights of Divine fruition does not entail any
   impoverishment of the lower levels of existence. The senses, the
   intellect, the normal religious faculty, each continue to exist "in
   their own place." This is another statement of the profound truth
   insisted upon in The Sparkling Stone: that the completed life of man,
   like that of its Pattern Christ, is both active and contemplative, both
   human and divine--"living wholly in God where we possess our
   blessedness, and wholly in ourselves where we exercise ourselves in
   love to God."

CHAPTER XIV

  HERE THE AUTHOR DECLARES THAT HE SUBMITS ALL THAT HE HAS WRITTEN TO THE
  JUDGMENT OF HOLY CHURCH

   Now at this time I cannot set forth my meaning more clearly. In all
   that I understand, or feel, or have written, I submit myself to the
   judgment of the saints and of Holy Church; for I wish to live and to
   die as a servant of Christ, in the Christian faith; and I desire to be,
   by the grace of God, a life-giving member of Holy Church. And
   therefore, as I told you heretofore, you should beware of those
   self-deceived men who, by means of their idle vacancy, and with their
   bare and simple gaze have found the Divine Essence within themselves in
   a merely natural way; and who pretend to be one with God without the
   grace of God, and without exercise of virtue, and without obedience to
   God and to Holy Church. And for all their perversity of life, which I
   have described, they would be one with God's Son by nature. But if the
   Prince of all the angels was cast out of heaven, because he set himself
   up against God and would be like unto the most High; and if the first
   man was driven from Paradise because he would be as God: how then shall
   this wretched sinner--that is, the faithless Christian who would be as
   God without likeness to God in grace and virtue--ever rise from earth
   into heaven? For through his own power no man has ascended into heaven,
   save the Son of Man, Jesus Christ. And therefore we must unite
   ourselves with Him, through grace and virtue and Christian faith: so we
   shall ascend with Him whither He has gone before us. For in the Last
   Day we shall all rise, each with his own body; and then those who have
   worked good works shall go into life everlasting, and those who have
   worked evil works shall go into everlasting fire. These are two unlike
   ends, which shall never come together for each flies from the other
   perpetually.

   Pray for him who has composed and written this, that God may have mercy
   upon him. That his poor beginning, and his and our wretched middle
   course may be brought to a blessed end, this may Jesus Christ, the Son
   of the living God, bestow upon us all. Amen.
