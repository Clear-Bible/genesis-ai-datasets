    AND PRINCIPAL OF ST I.EONARD'S COLLEGE, ST ANDREWS.

   MY DEAR SIR DAVID,

   I DEDICATE this Volume to you with sincere pleasure. Through your
   kindness I was enabled, while engaged in its composition, to have
   beside me certain volumes which otherwise I would have had great
   difficulty in procuring in my retirement in the country. I am glad to
   have such an opportunity of acknowledging this favour, as well as of
   expressing my grateful sense of the hearty interest which you have
   always taken in my studies, and my conviction of the cordiality with
   which you are always ready to respond to any demands on your literary
   sympathy, and to lend your encouragement to studious aspiration.

   I feel, moreover, that I can, with peculiar fitness, dedicate to you
   the attempt which is made in this Volume to trace some portion of the
   Divine meaning everywhere inscribed on Nature, and illustrated by the
   progress of Scientific Discovery. However imperfect this attempt may
   be, I am sure that it is one which will warmly engage your regard.

   Allow me to express the hope that you may be long spared to adorn our
   ancient University, on which your name and distinguished labours in
   science and literature have already conferred so much lustre.

   I have the honour to be,

   MY DEAR SIR DAVID,

   Yours faithfully,

   JOHN TULLOCH.

PREFACE.

   THE circumstances in which this Essay originated are probably familiar
   to many. It has been thought proper, however, briefly to state them
   here.

   Mr Burnett, a merchant in Aberdeen, whose character appears to have
   been marked by a rare degree of Christian sensibility and benevolence,
   amongst other acts of liberality, [1] bequeathed certain sums, to be
   expended at intervals of forty years, in the shape of two Premiums,
   inviting to the discussion of the evidences of religious truth, and
   especially to the consideration and confirmation of the attributes of
   Divine Wisdom and Goodness. The exact terms of the subject of inquiry,
   as given in Mr Burnett's own deed of bequest, will be found to head the
   Introduction which opens the present Essay.

   On the previous occasion of competition, the first of the Premiums was
   awarded to the late Principal Brown of Aberdeen, and the second to the
   Rev. John Bird Sumner, Fellow of Eton College, and now Archbishop of
   Canterbury.

   On this occasion, the First Premium of £1800 has been adjudged to the
   Rev. E. A. Thompson, M.A., Lincolnshire; and the second, of £600, to
   the present writer;--the judges having been Mr Isaac Taylor, Mr Henry
   Rogers, and the Rev. Baden Powell.

   In passing my Essay through the press, I have submitted it to a careful
   and thorough revision. Although the subject had been long in my mind,
   it had, in the end, assumed form very hurriedly; and on my receiving
   the manuscript back, many parts appeared to me greatly capable of
   improvement. I have not hesitated, therefore, to correct freely, with
   the view of imparting to the argument greater consistency, and to the
   whole a better finish. In its general plan and principles, however, the
   Essay remains substantially the same. Of the truth of these principles
   I feel, with the farther opportunity of reflection, only the more
   convinced, if I still continue to feel, as I truly do, that my
   representation of them is very imperfect.

   In reference to much of the illustrative matter embraced in the Essay,
   I think it right to state here, that I make no pretensions to an
   independent investigation of the scientific details. My special
   studies, such as they are, have been devoted to quite different
   provinces of inquiry. I have gathered my illustrative materials,
   therefore, from the most available sources which occurred to me,
   writing in a retired country Manse, where the difficulty of procuring
   the requisite books for such a miscellaneous course of study can only
   be understood by those who have experienced it. These sources, in some
   cases, are certainly not so original as I could have desired; but I
   have conscientiously aimed, in all cases, to present the facts as
   accurately as I could ascertain them; and there is little, if anything,
   of what I have thus collected that will, I think, be found open to a
   charge of inadvertency or inaccuracy.

   The spirit of fairness and comprehensiveness in which I have
   endeavoured to seize my subject throughout, will, I hope, commend
   itself to my readers. I have sought the truth simply; I have sought it
   with respect and tolerance for the opinions of those from whom I
   differ, but have never shrunk, in deference to any names, from the
   assertion of my own convictions. I certainly did not undertake the
   subject from the first as a mere taskwork, but because I felt a true
   interest in it, and conceived that it was capable, in some respects, of
   a more argumentatively consistent treatment than it had hitherto
   received. How far I have accomplished this my aim must be left to the
   judgment of others.

   I have further to express my acknowledgments to the kind friends who
   have given me their aid and advice in the correction of the press. I
   would fain have mentioned my obligations in this respect more
   particularly, had I been permitted.

   It is my earnest prayer that the volume now submitted to the public may
   in some degree fulfil, under the Divine blessing, the benevolent
   purpose in which it originated. May it strengthen, in the hearts of
   those who read it, impressions of that Divine wisdom and love which are
   all around them, and ever near to them.

INTRODUCTION.

   "THE EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS A BEING, ALL-POWERFUL, WISE, AND GOOD, BY
   WHOM EVERYTHING EXISTS; AND PARTICULARLY TO OBVIATE DIFFICULTIES
   REGARDING THE WISDOM AND GOODNESS OF THE DEITY; AND THIS, IN THE FIRST
   PLACE, FROM CONSIDERATIONS INDEPENDENT OF WRITTEN REVELATION; AND, IN
   THE SECOND PLACE, FROM THE REVELATION OF THE LORD JESUS; AND, FROM THE
   WHOLE, TO POINT OUT THE INFERENCES MOST NECESSARY FOR, AND USEFUL TO,
   MANKIND.'

   SOME ambiguity seems to rest on the main subject here claiming the
   consideration of the Essayist. The words may be so interpreted as to
   give for the special subject of Essay the polemical treatment of the
   various objections that have been urged against the wisdom and goodness
   of the Deity. This, however, is not the interpretation which they were
   probably intended to bear. The special attention claimed to
   difficulties respecting the Divine wisdom and goodness was not meant,
   in all likelihood, to constitute these the chief topics of treatment,
   in contrast to the general subject announced in the first clause; but
   simply to indicate that, inasmuch as these attributes have been more
   frequently the objects of sceptical assault, and are in themselves more
   obviously exposed to cavil, so they deserve a more particular proof,
   not only on positive grounds, but in direct reference to the objections
   which readily occur, and have been often brought against them. The
   truth is, that, in any attempt "to obviate" these difficulties, the
   main recourse must ever be to the vastly preponderating positive
   evidence in favour of the wisdom and goodness of the Deity; and just
   the more thorough and complete the presentation of this evidence, the
   less force will be felt in such difficulties, and the less trouble in
   dealing with them polemically.

   In any point of view, therefore, we consider ourselves justified in
   regarding the main and proper subject of Essay as that announced in the
   first clause--viz., the "Evidence that there is a Being, all-powerful,
   wise, and good, by whom everything exists." And to this subject,
   accordingly, the bulk of the present treatise is devoted.

   The science of Natural Theology has especially suffered from the narrow
   and one-sided spirit in which it has been cultivated. Separate
   inquirers have generally given themselves to some favourite branch of
   evidence, which they have not been content merely to explore by itself,
   but which they have aimed to exalt over other branches. The successive
   labours of natural theologians appear in this way to present the
   spectacle rather of inconsistent structures, displacing or overlying
   one another, than of parts fitting harmoniously together into one great
   scheme of argument. The still standing dispute between the a posteriori
   and a priori classes of thinkers, testifies strongly to this
   discordance. While some profound and earnest men have sought to raise
   the whole superstructure of natural theology upon an a priori datum,
   others, equally earnest, though with less speculative power, have at
   once put aside all such attempts as useless, and even impugned them
   with a jealous restrictiveness.

   Zeal on the one side has provoked contempt on the other; and here, as
   in other cases, the abstract reasoner and the popular expositor have
   seemed to stand as opponents, rather than as helpmates in the same
   cause. [2]

   The result of this has been not a little confusion and uncertainty as
   to the principles of the science on the one hand, and its
   comprehensiveness on the other. With a general acknowledgment of the
   convincing mass of evidence on which it is based, the clear logical
   coherence and relative bearing of that evidence are still very
   indistinctly apprehended. The problem of natural theology--what it
   really is? what principles it involves? and the distinctive character
   and force of these principles?--it cannot be said that there exists
   anything like harmony of opinion on these questions. Great as was the
   service rendered to the science by the varied interest and
   argumentative skill of the Bridgewater Treatises, these questions lay
   beyond the formal range of any of them; and, with all the light which
   they cast on its diversified applications, they contributed but little
   to the determination, the scientific analysis and co-ordination of its
   fundamental doctrine.

   But so far as the interests of the science are concerned in our day,
   this is undoubtedly the special task required of the natural
   theologian. It is in the region of First Principles, above all, that an
   earnest and sifting discussion is now taking place. There is an evident
   striving to grasp in a clearer solution, to hold in a more thorough
   unity and comprehensiveness than have been hitherto attained, the
   elements of our science. The spirit of eclecticism which has largely
   penetrated philosophy in general, is seeking, in this department of it,
   with special eagerness, a common centre and pervading interest. We have
   ourselves, at least, strongly felt the necessity for a treatment of the
   theistic problem at once more penetrating and synthetic, and have
   accordingly aimed at such a treatment of it in the present essay.

   We apprehend the theistic evidence, as far as possible, under one plan
   or scheme, which may be generally called "Inductive." Inasmuch,
   however, as this plan of evidence, in its very conception, rests upon
   certain definite principles of philosophical belief, we consider it
   necessary, in the first instance, to lay down and verify these
   principles. We have felt that, in the present state of speculative
   discussion, we could not for a moment take these principles for
   granted, seeing that the two most living and active schools of
   philosophical unbelief proceed upon the express negation of them, and
   that in them really lies the gist of the theistic problem. It is our
   aim, accordingly, not merely to state these principles, but to
   establish them.

   Having laid down a satisfactory basis of principles, we proceed, in the
   second section of the essay, to unfold, in something like organic
   relation and coherence, the array of inductive or a posteriori evidence
   for the Divine power, wisdom, and goodness presented by the vastly
   diversified phenomena of matter and of mind. This obviously is a
   boundless field, which no range of inquiry can exhaust, and which, even
   were it possible, it would be needless, for the end in view, to try to
   exhaust. Our object is simply to unfold the distinguishing and
   essential features of this ever-accumulating mass of evidence, and to
   present them, as far as we can, in an order of progression, in which
   they may be seen to bear with expansive force upon the vindication and
   illustration of the Divine character. We advance from the more general
   and simple phenomena of nature, through the more complex, up to the
   highest and most subtle combinations to be found in man's intellectual
   and emotive constitution; and in the course of this procession it is
   our chief aim--that under the guidance of which we advance--to seize
   and set forth those ultimate typical realities which all along meet us,
   and which, while in their mystery they point directly back to a Divine
   Source, serve at the same time prominently to characterise this Source.
   It is only some guiding aim of this sort, however imperfectly it may be
   carried out, that could bring within any intelligible limits, or give
   any living interest to, such a survey.

   Whereas the section on "Principles" will, it is hoped, serve to verify
   on the deepest grounds the fundamental theistic conception of an
   intelligent First Cause,--this second illustrative section will serve
   to clothe the bare abstract idea of such a Cause in the attributes of
   power, wisdom, and goodness reflected from the great leading forms or
   facts of nature.

   Having completed our inductive survey, we return, in a third section,
   which we have entitled "Moral Intuitive Evidence," to the region of
   First Principles, and in this region endeavour further to establish
   certain elements of the theistic conception--viz., Personality,
   Righteousness, and Infinity--without a special verification of which,
   every theistic argument must, according to our view, utterly fail of
   its purpose. Under this section of evidence we are led to treat of the
   common a priori argument, and to assign to it its distinctive value in
   the general plan of theistic speculation.

   It may be inferred from what we have said that, while our second
   section of Evidence corresponds to the common treatment of the a
   posteriori argument, as exemplified in Paley and the Bridgewater
   Treatises, both our first and third sections deal simply with the
   elements of the a priori argument. And if any choose to apply the term
   a priori to the discussions contained in these sections, it matters
   very little. They really, however, embrace a course of reasoning to
   which that term, in the restrictive sense in which it has been applied
   to definite arguments for the existence of the Deity, has no proper
   application. [3]

   Upon any definite scheme of a priori argumentation, involving a process
   of mere abstract deduction from some single element of thought, or even
   of experience, it will be seen in the sequel that we do not place any
   reliance. We are as little inclined as those who have most zealously
   opposed this sort of argumentation, to ascribe a convincing force to
   it. So far we are at one with the general spirit of natural theological
   inquiry which prevails in this country, as represented by such writers
   as Brown, Brougham, and Chalmers. But, then, we consider that these
   writers, while rightly repudiating the conclusiveness of a priori
   reasoning in reference to our subject, have failed to set forth, and
   even to apprehend with clearness and comprehensiveness, the subjective
   conditions, or, in our previous language, principles, which their a
   posteriori argument at once presupposes as its essential basis, and
   demands in order to its complete and effective validity. Now, it is
   simply the object of the first and third section of this essay to
   determine and verify these conditions or principles, which, as thus
   forming both the only adequate foundation, and the culminating force of
   the general evidence for the Divine existence and character, seem
   eminently in the present day to claim the attention of the natural
   theologian. The chain of induction goes up in unnumbered links; but
   this chain rests at both points on principles of intuitive belief,
   which must be thoroughly understood and substantiated.

   While, therefore, our third section receives a distinctive name, and
   might, as a branch of theistic evidence, to some extent stand by
   itself, we would yet have it to be viewed in strict connection with the
   preceding sections; in which connection alone our general Evidence will
   be seen in its fully conclusive bearing.

   A fourth and concluding section is devoted, according to our view of
   the terms of the subject, to a particular examination of the
   "difficulties regarding the wisdom and goodness of the Deity," as they
   derive any explanation from the light of Nature, or finally from the
   disclosures of "written Revelation."

   Throughout the essay we have kept in view very prominently the
   anti-theistic tendencies of our time, especially as manifested in the
   form of Positivism. This seemed to be demanded by the character of the
   essay, which, prescribed at intervals of forty years, was probably
   designed to meet the forms of speculative scepticism likely to arise at
   such intervals. In the history of thought, forty years is a wide
   period, during which great changes of opinion may be expected to occur.
   And it is at least certain that, since the date of the publication of
   the last essays on our subject, the questions between the Christian
   Theist and the speculative Sceptic, if, as they must ever be,
   essentially the same, have yet assumed very changed aspects.
   Materialistic Pantheism, in the shape of "Positive Philosophy," has
   especially assumed a dignity and pretension which in some respects
   invest it with a new character, and require a new and more
   comprehensive mode of treatment. Our essay throughout will be found to
   bear the impress of this conviction. [4]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2] This conflict among natural theologians was already indicated by
   Kant in his great work, in which he submits all the separate modes of
   theistic argument to a keenly scientific sifting. And it is impossible
   that any can be familiar with even our own British literature on the
   subject, without being made aware of the existence of such a conflict.

   [3] The term a priori is not, in fact, applied with any consistency
   even to these arguments, some of the different forms of the Cartesian
   argument, and that of Clarke especially, resting on an express datum of
   experience; whereas it is the pretension of a pure a priori argument to
   demonstrate the Divine existence from the formal conceptions of the
   human mind.

   [4] Miss Martineau's recent translation of Comte's great work, and Mr
   G. H. Lewes' popular exposition of Positivism (published as one of the
   volumes of Bohn's Scientific Library), give additional significance to
   the purpose that animates our essay.

SECTION I.

PRINCIPLES OF INDUCTIVE EVIDENCE
     __________________________________________________________________

§ I.--CHAPTER I.

  PRINCIPLES OF EVIDENCE.

   THE Theistic Evidence, in its common inductive form, derives its
   logical force from certain principles implied in its very conception.
   It is necessary, therefore, in entering upon our subject, to determine
   these principles, and the grounds on which they rest. The special
   necessity of such an initial explanation and verification of
   principles, is shown by the fact that it is in regard to them alone
   that there remains any dispute. The question between the Theist and the
   Anti-Theist--Pantheist or Atheist--necessarily always resolves itself
   into one of this fundamental character. It becomes a controversy, not
   as to the existence of certain phenomena in nature whose existence is
   really indisputable on either side but as to the true meaning or
   interpretation of these phenomena. And especially is this the present
   aspect of the question, amid the new stir which, from opposite
   quarters, has begun in philosophical inquiry. We cannot therefore save
   ourselves, even if we would, from taking up the speculative discussions
   which lie across the threshold of our subject, and endeavouring to
   establish our position securely on the narrow platform of First
   Principles. In this way, besides, we shall exhibit, better than in any
   other, the condensed logical force of the Evidence, illustratively
   expanded in the succeeding section. The theistic argument may be
   syllogistically expressed as follows, in a form which appears to us at
   once simple and free from ambiguity--viz., First or major premiss,

   Order universally proves Mind.

   Second, or minor premiss,

   The works of Nature discover Order.

   Conclusion,

   The works of Nature prove Mind. [5]

   It is of great importance to keep clear in the outset of all ambiguous
   or misleading terms. And this conviction has led us to reject from our
   syllogism such common expressions as not only "cause" and "effect," but
   also "design." There will be abundant use in the sequel for this latter
   expression in all its full and appropriate significance, when we have
   established the great general doctrine on which it rests--viz., That
   Mind is everywhere the only valid explanation of Order--its necessary
   correlate.

   It is this doctrine--the equivalent obviously of the major premiss of
   our syllogism--which appears to us to present, in its really valid and
   fundamental character, the theistic problem. Essentially, it is neither
   more nor less than the old doctrine of Final Causes; but, for the
   reason already stated, we prefer considering it in the mean time in a
   new and untechnical form of expression.

   Upon this fundamental position rests the whole burden of the inductive
   theistic argument. If this position can be established--if the right of
   Intelligence to stand everywhere as the correlate of Order can be made
   good--the Pantheist or Positivist very well knows that, even according
   to his own favourite mode of viewing nature as a system of law or
   order, the theistic conclusion directly follows. The fact of a
   supremely Intelligent Cause then everywhere asserts itself. The
   discoveries of science, in all their rich variety, became only
   tributary witnesses to this fact. Here, accordingly, the whole contest
   of Theism centres, and finds its most vital struggle. And of this the
   opposite school of thinkers are sufficiently aware. They clearly feel
   that it is here alone that a consistent position of denial can be taken
   up. The right of Mind to be held everywhere as the correlate of Order,
   and so to stand at the head of nature, is stoutly, and even scornfully,
   impugned by them. That Mind is in man and animals the appropriate
   explanation of many facts of order, is of course not denied; but it is
   expressly denied that it has any claim to be regarded as the only true
   source, and final explanation, of all order.

   We may seem to have put the theistic problem in a somewhat unfamiliar
   form. But, while confessedly not the form in which it has been usually
   discussed, it is nevertheless that in which, beyond all doubt, it most
   urgently presses itself upon our attention. Even in the writings of
   Hume it is this aspect of the question which suggests itself most
   powerfully, and which gives the main point to his famous sceptical
   reasoning--a fact which has not been sufficiently perceived. Interest
   has been concentrated upon his ingenious attempt to represent the world
   as a "singular effect," but without a clear insight into the deeper
   principle by which he was led to take up this ground, and which alone
   gives to it all its force. If we can establish Mind as the universal
   correlate of order, it must be manifest that there is no room for such
   a position as that the world is a "singular effect." The only question
   is, Does the world discover order? That Hume was perfectly aware of
   this, and that the real and final question regarding Theism related to
   the rightful claims and dignity of Mind, is so abundantly plain in the
   course of his reasoning, that it seems strange that it has not hitherto
   attracted more special examination. Even Dr Chalmers--who plainly
   enough saw that the mode, adopted by Reid and Stewart, of settling the
   matter by at once declaring design to be an intuitive principle of
   belief, was not all that was demanded against such an opponent--does
   not seem to have penetrated to this essential element of the subtlety
   which he manfully encounters. So far triumphant in his vindication of
   the theistic inference, as resting on the same basis of experience as
   any other inference from design, he does not yet reach, and bring out
   fully, the ultimate rational truth on which alone that inference, in
   the end, must rest.

   To employ his own illustration, "If we can infer the agency of design
   in a watchmaker, though we never saw a watch made, we can, on the very
   same ground, infer the agency of design on the part of a world-maker,
   though we never saw a world made." All that is requisite to constitute
   the inference valid in either case is not, as the sceptical objection
   implied, experience with the actual production of the special
   effects--with the making of a watch on the one hand, or the making of a
   world on the other--but only with the simple fact of adaptation on the
   one hand, and Mind as its explanation on the other. This general form
   of experience is the sufficiently warrantable basis of inference in
   either case. [6] But it must be plain, we think, that the result of
   experience, generalise it as we may, can only be argumentatively valid
   when seen to be a truth of reason--in other words, when transformed
   into the position laid down in our first premiss, viz. that adaptation
   or order universally proves Mind. For otherwise we do not see how it
   would avail to say that the "watch," so far as our experience of its
   production is concerned, is in the very same category as the "world."
   The old objection would still recur, in this higher form, exactly the
   opposite of the position we have laid down--viz., that order (confessed
   in many cases to be the result of mind) cannot yet be validly
   maintained, in all cases, to flow only from Mind. No basis of
   experience simply can warrant such a conclusion. Admitting the effects
   to be similar, we are not thereby warranted in asserting that the
   explanation of the human effect is the only valid explanation of the
   universal effect. It can only be on grounds of reason--on the basis not
   simply of experience, but of the inherent laws of our rational
   constitution--that we can impregnably take up such a position against
   the Anti-Theist. This must, beyond doubt, come to be the final
   argumentative bearing of the question--which is thus really, when
   pushed back to its last analysis, one not so much regarding the world
   as a singular effect, as regarding Mind as a singular cause.

   How this appears in the writings of Hume as the really vital element of
   the question, is abundantly clear from the following paragraphs:-- [7]

   "But can you think, Cleanthes, that your usual philosophy has been
   preserved in so wide a step as you have taken, when you compared to the
   universe houses, ships, furniture, machines, and, from their similarity
   in some circumstances, inferred a similarity in their causes? Thought,
   design, intelligence, such as we discover in men and other animals, is
   no more than one of the springs and principles of the universe, as well
   as heat or cold, attraction or repulsion, and a hundred others which
   fall under daily observation. It is an active cause by which some
   particular parts of nature, we find, produce alterations on other
   parts. But can a conclusion, with any propriety, be transferred from
   parts to the whole?"

   "But, allowing that we were to take the operations of one part of
   nature upon another for the foundation of our judgment concerning the
   origin of the whole (which never can be admitted), yet why select so
   minute, so weak, so bounded a principle as the reason and design of
   animals is found to be upon this planet? What peculiar privilege has
   this little agitation of the brain, which we call thought, that we must
   thus make it the model of the whole universe?"

   "Admirable conclusion! Stone, wood, brick, iron, brass, have not, at
   this time, in this minute globe of earth, an order or arrangement
   without human art and contrivance; therefore the universe could not
   originally attain its order and arrangement without something similar
   to human art. But is a part of nature a rule for another part very wide
   of the former? Is it a rule for the whole? Is a very small part a rule
   for the UNIVERSE?"

   The real subject of dispute, then, on the old battle-ground of Theism,
   which has descended to us, regards the valid claim of Mind to stand
   universally as the Interpretation of Order. And more eminently than
   ever, in the present day, is this the vital point at issue. The views
   thrown out with such an apparently heedless, yet far-reaching subtlety,
   by Hume, have at length been taken up in a strictly scientific form,
   and elaborated into a philosophical creed, which boasts numerous and
   able advocates. Positivism, indeed, if springing directly from the
   irreverent soil of French scientific culture, yet traces back its
   lineage to the Scottish sceptic, of whose keen and arrogant genius it
   is so fitting a representative.

   It is true that, in this modern sceptical system, the theological
   bearing of the views advocated is not always prominently brought
   forward--sometimes rather simply passed by, as beyond the concern of
   science. This is especially the case with the writer who is, in this
   country, its ablest and most systematic expositor. But in other cases
   no opportunity is lost of bringing out this bearing in the most decided
   manner; and, even in the chief work of the writer in question, it is so
   clear and unmistakable that it is impossible not to perceive, under the
   show of courtesy, the deadly shafts levelled at the foundation of the
   theistic argument. This will be sufficiently apparent from the
   following quotation, which condenses the result of a train of argument,
   the object of which is to prove that what Mr Mill calls the "Volitional
   Theory" [8] meaning thereby the very truth which we have laid down in
   our first proposition is incompetent to stand as the only (ultimate)
   explanation of phenomena in general. We present it, in the mean time,
   merely in order that the antagonistic position with which we have to
   deal may be seen in its full meaning and force.

   "Though it were granted," he says, [9] "that every phenomenon has an
   efficient, and not merely a phenomenal cause, and that volition, in the
   case of the peculiar phenomena which are known to be produced by it, is
   that efficient cause, are we, therefore, to say with these writers,
   that since we know of no other efficient cause, and ought not to assume
   one without evidence, there is no other, and volition is the direct
   cause of all phenomena? A more outrageous stretch of inference could
   hardly be made. Because among the infinite variety of the phenomena of
   nature there is one--namely, a particular mode of action of certain
   nerves--which has for its cause, and, as we are now supposing, for its
   efficient cause, a state of our mind; and because this is the only
   efficient cause of which we are conscious, being the only one of which,
   in the nature of the case, we can be conscious, since it is the only
   one which exists within ourselves, does this justify us in concluding
   that all other phenomena must have the same kind of efficient cause
   with that one eminently special, narrow, and peculiarly human or animal
   phenomenon?"

   In endeavouring to verify the position which forms the argumentative
   basis of our Evidence, there are two special lines of proof demanded of
   us--the one relating directly to the position itself--that Order
   universally proves Mind, or, in other words, that Design is a principle
   pervading the universe; and the other relating to a doctrine which, as
   it appears to us, lies everywhere involved in the more special
   theological principle. This principle, in the form announced in our
   first proposition, undoubtedly implies a definite doctrine of
   causation. In asserting the principle of design, we clearly assert, at
   the same time, that Mind alone answers to our true, or at least
   ultimate, idea of cause. We pronounce causation, or at least our
   highest conception of it, to imply efficiency. But does it really do
   so? We find ourselves met on this general philosophical ground as to
   the true nature of causation, as well as on the ground of the special
   theological application which we make of the general truth. They who
   dispute the theistic interpretation of nature, no less dispute the
   doctrine of efficient causation, and in fact base their opposition to
   the higher principle on this lower and wider ground.

   In order, therefore, fully to sustain our position, we must make it
   good on this lower ground. According to our whole view, the one
   position is untenable apart from the other. The two doctrines of final
   causes and of efficient causation we regard as essentially related.
   They are not to us, indeed, separate doctrines, but only separate
   phases of the same fundamental necessity of our rational nature: the
   relation of the two is not that of dependency--the one upon the
   other--but of intricacy--the one in the other; for while the
   theological principle virtually asserts the philosophical, the latter,
   in its highest conception, already implicitly contains the former.

   It is very true that many theistic thinkers, and eminently among
   ourselves Dr Chalmers, [10] have not recognised this interchangeable
   relation between the general doctrine of causation and the special
   theological doctrine. But a fact of this sort has no farther claim to
   our consideration, than to lead us to ponder more thoroughly the
   grounds of our own conviction; and the more this is done, the more, we
   feel confident, will the view set forth in the following pages approve
   itself as the only sound and comprehensive one.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [5] Dr Reid long ago expressed the theistic argument in a syllogistic
   form, as follows: "First, That design and intelligence in the cause
   may, with certainty, be inferred from marks or signs of it in the
   effect. This is the major proposition of the argument. The second,
   which we call the minor proposition, is, That there are in fact the
   clearest marks of design and wisdom in the works of nature; and the
   conclusion is, That the works of nature are the effects of a wise and
   intelligent Cause. One must either assent to the conclusion, or deny
   one or other of the premises." To this statement of the theistic
   syllogism, which, to say the least, is not remarkable for precision,
   considerable exception has been taken by succeeding writers. Dr
   Crombie, in his work on Natural Theology, maintains that the syllogism
   of Reid is vicious in this respect, that in passing from the major to
   the minor proposition, he tacitly carries over to the "works of nature"
   the conclusion suggested by the term "effect;" while yet, according to
   Dr Crombie, this is the very thing to be proved--viz., That the world
   is an effect. He thus represents Reid's statement of the argument:
   "Marks of design in the effect prove design in the cause. The works of
   nature are an effect, and exhibit marks of design; therefore the works
   of nature prove design in the cause." Besides the invalid assumption
   which Dr Crombie maintains is here introduced into the minor premiss,
   he objects, and we think with perfect justice, to the mode in which the
   first proposition is stated, "marks of design in the effect" being
   simply equivalent to "design in the cause." The more general form in
   which we have put the syllogism in the text, appears to us entirely to
   obviate these objections; and especially to liberate us from any such
   preliminary necessity as that of proving the world to be an "effect."
   By putting out of view this term, and dealing simply with the fact of
   order, we have already, according to the truth of our first
   proposition, Mind as its cause. It is not necessary that we show
   previously that the orderly fact or phenomenon is an "effect," for this
   simple reason, that in its very nature it is such. In virtue of its
   character as manifesting order it is already declared a product or
   effect. This of course may be held equally true on the syllogistic
   basis of Reid; and we do not therefore concur in this part of Dr
   Crombie's criticism. Only by avoiding the use of the term "effect," we
   obviate such an objection. Our mode of expression disencumbers the
   argument of an extraneous element of debate, and so far places the
   sceptical cavil of Hume simply beside the question.

   [6] This is virtually the import of Chalmers' amplified argument. See
   his Natural Theology, pp. 150-151.

   [8] Mill's transposition of the Theistic Principle into a "Volitional
   Theory," is just one of the many instances in which the real import of
   the principle has been obscured under a one-sided and wilfully
   perverted nomenclature. It is surely time that, in the search after
   truth, men should cease to be content to escape from the pressure of an
   antagonistic doctrine, by hiding its highest meaning under an easily
   degraded phraseology! There is a further misrepresentation conveyed by
   Mr Mill's language, which, although it will be afterwards fully cleared
   up, it may be well to notice here, as tending to involve our own
   position in some degree of doubt. He speaks of the writers, against
   whom he argues, maintaining volition to be the "direct cause of all
   phenomena"--a statement very readily suggesting a caricature of their
   true doctrine--which does not for a moment deny the fact of physical
   causes, in Mr Mill's sense of that term, but only that these causes,
   save as taking their rise in a RATIONAL Will, and forming an expression
   of such a Will, afford no satisfactory explanation of the phenomena. It
   is not by any means as their direct or immediate cause (in the sense of
   excluding physical causes--general laws), but only always as their
   First or Original Cause, that Mind is spoken of as the explanation of
   physical phenomena.

§ I.--CHAPTER II

  DOCTRINE OF CAUSATION.

   THERE have been few if any questions in Philosophy more thoroughly
   discussed than that of causation. Especially since the sceptical genius
   of Hume carried its pitiless search into the foundations of the
   prevailing philosophy of his day, and exposed its genuine logical
   consequences, has speculative discussion gathered round this point as a
   centre, and found unceasing life in it. It appears to us that at length
   the ground may be said to be pretty well cleared, if not for a
   settlement of the question, yet for a definite truce regarding it. For
   it has become clearly apparent that the combatants, on one side at
   least, contend, not so much in direct opposition to the view held on
   the other side, as for a further and higher view in addition. The two
   classes of thinkers are indeed fundamentally opposed, but they are not
   throughout opposed. For the one class only insists on carrying up the
   position of the other into a higher, and, as they think, more
   comprehensive Truth than the other will admit. The one feels impelled
   to look beyond the mere physical view, and to find everywhere in Nature
   a further and more sacred MEANING than the other is content to accept.

   It is no longer, for example, disputed by any school of philosophy,
   that all we perceive of the relation between physical phenomena is a
   relation of succession. "It is now universally admitted that we have no
   perception of the causal nexus in the material world." [11] The
   writings of Hume and of Brown, and again of Mill in our own day, have
   been so far successful in making this plain beyond doubt, and exposing,
   in its precise form, the bearing of the question between them and the
   opposite school of thinkers. We see events following events in regular
   succession. All that we really see and apprehend is the succession.
   "The impulse of one billiard ball is attended with motion in the
   second. This is the whole that appears to the outward senses." [12] But
   is this perception of sequence commensurate with our notion of
   causation? Is it what we specially mean when we express the relation of
   cause and effect? If the measure of our experience be the measure of
   our conception, why is it that we do not apply the one universally to
   the objects of the other? To take the often repeated illustration of
   the relation between day and night. This we apprehend as an invariable
   succession. Yet we never understand nor speak of day as the cause of
   night, or the reverse. It must be admitted, then, that our empirical
   apprehension is at least not commensurate with our causal judgment. And
   this is in fact admitted by Mr Mill in reference to this very relation,
   and the "very specious objection" which he acknowledges has been often
   founded upon it, against his view of the subject. "When we define," he
   says, [13] "the cause of anything to be the antecedent, which it
   invariably follows,' we do not use this phrase as exactly synonymous
   with the antecedent which it invariably has followed in our past
   experience.' Such a mode of conceiving causation would be liable to the
   objection very plausibly urged by Dr Reid--namely, that, according to
   this doctrine, night must be the cause of day, and day the cause of
   night; since these phenomena have invariably succeeded one another from
   the beginning of the world. But it is necessary to our using the word
   cause, that we should believe not only that the antecedent always has
   been followed by the consequent, but that, as long as the present
   constitution of things endures, it always will be so, and this would
   not be true of day and night."

   The concession forced upon Mr Mill, and expressed in this passage is,
   we cannot help thinking, remarkable. It is here clearly admitted, that
   the measure of our observational experience is not the measure of the
   idea of causation, even as held by him. It is not the perception of
   uniform succession merely, but a certain belief regarding the
   succession, which specially determines it to be a relation of cause and
   effect. But what do the opponents of a mere sensational philosophy
   everywhere contend for, but just the admission of such an element of
   belief, as the determining element of the idea of causation? The
   belief, no doubt, is with them of a very different character, and
   arises in a very different manner from that represented by Mr Mill; but
   it is significant how, in the most earnest effort which has been made
   in our time to resolve the idea of causation into that of mere
   antecedence and consequence, there should be allowed to enter an
   element of belief which is confessedly not generated by our mere
   observation of sequence. The sequence, besides being invariable, or, in
   other words, uniformly observed, Mr Mill says must be unconditional;
   and day and night is not a sequence of this character. "We do not
   believe that night will be followed by day under all imaginable
   circumstances, but only that it will be so, provided the sun rises
   above the horizon." According to this view, before we can pronounce any
   two phenomena to be in the relation of cause and effect, we must not
   only have observed the fact of their invariable association, but we
   must know that, according to the "present constitution of things," [14]
   they always will be associated. We must understand the conditions of
   the sequence so thoroughly, as to comprehend whether they form a part
   of "the general laws of matter," before we can rightly pronounce the
   one term of the sequence to be the cause of the other.

   But if it were not already apparent in the outset of Mr Mill's
   discussion, this conclusion were enough to show that the subject with
   which he concerns himself, under the name of causation, and that which
   is commonly meant under that name, and in our view is alone entitled to
   it, are quite different. While, under this name, he really speaks of
   the order which, according to the "general laws of matter," obtains
   among the phenomena of nature--the "invariable and unconditional"
   dependence which, in virtue of these laws, subsists among physical
   sequences--the intellectual common sense, by causation, does not mean
   to express anything of this sort. It does not concern itself with the
   special conditions under which phenomena emerge, so as to determine
   their invariable and unconditional antecedents (in Mr Mill's language,
   their causes); but on the emergence of any phenomenon, the appearance
   of any change, it simply says that it is caused; meaning by this, that
   the change does not originate in itself, but in something else. It says
   this wholly irrespective of the special sources or conditions of the
   change; and says it equally, although it should never learn anything of
   these sources or conditions. It pronounces, in short, not what is the
   relation among observed phenomena, but only that all phenomena, whether
   lying within the sphere of our observation or not, are related.
   Springing from even a single basis of experience, this judgment goes
   forth without hesitation into the whole world of reality, and
   everywhere proclaims its validity; and it is this judgment which
   constitutes to the common sense the doctrine of causation.

   It is of importance to understand what is the real difference which
   thus exists between sensationalists of the school of Hume and Mill, and
   those who contend for a deeper meaning in causation than they allow.
   Artfully shifting the question of causation into the domain of physical
   observation, they come, in fact, to treat of something quite special,
   which, under whatever protestations, they in the end assume to be the
   whole matter, so far as it has any intelligible relation to the human
   mind. Mr Mill, for example, while declaring that he is "in no way
   concerned" in the question of efficient causes, and that he simply
   passes it by, has no sooner laid down his own "law of causation," than
   he turns to contemplate in its light the doctrine of causation as
   commonly understood, and on the strength of his own principles to
   engage in an elaborate refutation of this doctrine. Now, this does not
   seem to us to be really the fairest way of dealing with a subject of so
   much importance. To profess to have in view simply the discussion of
   physical causes and effects --as to the relation of which there is
   really no dispute--and yet to pass over from this to the truth of
   causation as a principle of human knowledge, can only tend to mislead
   the reader, and embroil still farther the metaphysical controversy
   which Mr Mill is desirous of avoiding. The Positivist must either abide
   in the domain of physical phenomena--where none deny that all which
   comes directly within the sphere of human knowledge is mere antecedence
   and consequence--or he must be prepared to take up the general fact of
   causation, as it reveals itself in the common intellectual
   consciousness, and show it to be coincident in import with the law of
   mere succession. It is on this ground of common belief that the
   question must be discussed. We have already so far seen what this
   belief signifies. Let us still more precisely fix its import.

   When, on the appearance of any change, we instinctively pronounce it to
   have a cause, what do we really mean? Do we affirm merely that some
   other thing has gone before the observed phenomenon? Is priority the
   constitutive element of our intellectual judgment? Is it not rather
   something quite different? Is not our judgment characteristically to
   this effect that some other thing has not only preceded but produced
   the change we contemplate? Nay, is it not this element of production
   that we peculiarly mean to express in the use of the term "cause"?
   Succession is no doubt also involved, but it is not the relation of
   succession with which the mind, in the supposed judgment, is directly
   and initially concerned, but rather the relation of power. That when we
   speak of cause and effect, we express merely the relation of
   conjunction between phenomena of antecedence and consequence in any
   defined sense, is something of which no ingenuity of sophistry will
   ever be able to persuade the common mind. It matters not in the least
   degree that it can be so clearly proved that nothing intervenes between
   the simple facts observed, that all we see is the sequence of the
   phenomena. This is not in dispute. Only, the intellectual common sense
   insists on recognising a deeper relation among phenomena than mere
   sequence. It accepts the order of succession, which it is the special
   function of Science to trace everywhere to its most general expression;
   but it moreover says of this order, that it is throughout produced, or,
   in other words, that it is only explicable as involving a further
   element of power. That this is really the import of the intellectual
   judgment which we pronounce in speaking of cause and effect--to which
   the very words themselves testify in an unmistakable manner--is so
   clear, that it is now admitted by every school of philosophy which does
   not rest on a basis of materialism, and has even been conceded by
   writers of this school, however irresolvable on their principles. [15]

   Causation, therefore, implies power. What we mean by a cause is
   something quite different from a mere antecedent, however we may define
   the conditions of its relation to the consequent. It is peculiarly an
   AGENT.

   But in order to see this more fully, it will be necessary to consider
   whence we have the idea of power, which we have seen to constitute the
   main element of causation. That this idea is not derived from
   without--that it does not come through any phase of sensational
   experience--is already clear in the fact admitted on all hands, that we
   only perceive succession--that we are only conversant, through the
   senses, with the two terms of a sequence. But if not from without, it
   must be from within; we must have the idea of power given us in our own
   mental experience. This we hold to be the fact; and recent
   psychological analysis has pretty sufficiently explained the more
   special origin of this prime intellectual element. It flows from the
   depths of our self-consciousness; or, more truly speaking, it is
   nothing else than the ideal projection of our self-consciousness. With
   the first dawn of mind we apprehend ourselves as distinct from the
   objective phenomena surrounding us; the Ego emerges, face to face, with
   the non-Ego. And in this springing forth of self, so far back in the
   mental history as to elude all trace, is primarily given the idea of
   power.

   What is commonly called the Will, therefore, is, according to this
   view, the ultimate source or fountain of the notion of causation. We
   apprehend ourselves as agents, and in this apprehension we have
   already, in the fullest sense, the idea of cause. Had we not this
   apprehension, it seems impossible that we could have ever risen above
   sequence, as the obvious fact given us in outward observation. With
   this apprehension lying at the very root of our being, and constituting
   it essentially, it is equally impossible that we can hold by that fact
   as furnishing the exhaustive conception of the Universe. According to
   the radical and imperative character of our mental constitution, we
   must recognise a deeper life than mere sequence, however grand and
   orderly, in the phenomena of nature; and this deeper life is just what
   we mean by a cause. Not sequency, therefore, but agency, or, in other
   words, efficiency, is the attribute commensurate with our notion of
   causation.

   The question before us then really passes into the old one as to the
   origin of our knowledge. Let it only be admitted that our knowledge is
   the product of a spiritual as well as a material factor, and then it is
   quite beside the question to argue that because cause, according to our
   interpretation of it, is not given in external nature, the notion of it
   is not a valid and real portion of human knowledge; on the very
   contrary, it becomes, in such a case, only an obvious and expected
   conclusion that we should find more in outward phenomena than they, so
   to speak, contain. The subjective brings its element of knowledge as
   well as the objective; and it is not merely what we apprehend by the
   senses, but what, through the whole mental life awakened in us by the
   original contact of subject and object, spirit and matter, we
   intuitively know or believe to be the truth--that we must hold as the
   truth. The only available argument against this position--save on a
   basis of pure materialism--would be to dispute the reality of any such
   primitive mental experience as we have asserted--the fact of that
   consciousness of agency, which we have assumed as indisputable.

   It is of great importance that the view which we have thus endeavoured
   to set forth should be comprehended in its precise import, with
   reference both to certain objections which have been urged against it,
   and to the final conclusion to which it seems to us to lead. It will be
   observed that we trace the idea of causation, in its primitive origin,
   to our self-consciousness, our apprehension of ourselves as distinct
   activities, not carried away in, but exercising a reaction upon, the
   flow of physical sequences. This apprehension, in its most obscure
   form, involves what has been specially called the Will. The
   apprehension of ourselves is and can be nothing else than the
   apprehension of our personal voluntary activity. In its most mature and
   developed form this apprehension becomes what is called the
   consciousness of free will. The causal idea, however, is not dependent
   on any particular manifestations of this highest form of our activity.
   It is already present in its dawn in our primitive self-consciousness.
   It awakens side by side with the Ego; and is therefore truly, as M.
   Cousin calls it, the "primary idea."

   The clear perception of this will clear away some difficulties from the
   view exhibited. It has been represented, for example, as if the
   advocates of the theory of efficient causation held the notion to be
   given altogether independently of experience in the very conception of
   voluntary action, apart from its exercise. They have been held as
   maintaining that the "feeling of energy or force inherent in an act of
   will is knowledge à priori; assurance prior to experience that we have
   the power of causing effects." [16] But, so far as we understand this
   statement at all, it seems to us to imply something which could not
   well be deliberately maintained by any one, however an incautious use
   of expressions may have led the writer to suppose so. It implies
   something, certainly, which we are so far from maintaining, that it
   appears to us to be simply absurd and inconceivable. To speak of any
   mental possession as prior to or independent of experience, in the
   right and comprehensive meaning of that term, is to speak of something
   which, in the nature of things, is impossible. Our consciousness only
   comes into being under experience-conditions. All our mental life only
   arises under them; and of what it would be or contain apart from them,
   we can have no conception. Of an "assurance prior to experience, that
   we have the power of causing effects," we therefore know nothing.
   Experience is already present in the first act of consciousness, and
   our idea of cause flows from the primitive awakening of consciousness
   under the contact of experience. It is already given in the primary
   apprehension of our personal existence. It may, therefore, certainly be
   held before the mind apart from special results; but apart from
   voluntary activity, as such, and in a true sense, it is inconceivable.

   Again, with reference to a special objection of more importance, the
   view we have presented seems to render it inapplicable. The objection
   in question deserves examination, as having been taken up by Sir W.
   Hamilton, and urged by him against our doctrine. The weakness, however,
   which Sir William assails successfully, does not lie in the doctrine
   itself, but only in the special statement of it which is the subject of
   his criticism. This statement is that of a distinguished French
   philosopher, M. de Biran, who has certainly the eminent merit of
   having, in the most elaborate manner, fixed attention on the theory of
   causation under discussion. It is to this effect: "I will to move my
   arm, and I move it." This complex fact gives us on analysis: 1, The
   consciousness of an act of will; 2, The consciousness of motion
   produced; 3, The consciousness of a relation of the motion to the
   volition. This relation is in no respect a simple relation of
   succession. The motion not merely follows our will, or appears in
   conjunction with it, but it is consciously produced by it. The idea of
   power or cause is thus evolved. Sir W. Hamilton objects to the theory
   thus laid down, that the empirical fact on which it is founded is
   incorrect. "For," he says, [17] "between the overt fact of corporeal
   movement, which we perceive, and the internal act of the will to move,
   of which we are self-conscious, there intervenes a series of
   intermediate agencies, of which we are wholly unaware; consequently, we
   can have no consciousness, as this hypothesis maintains, of any causal
   connection between the extreme links of this chain--that is, between
   the volition to move and the arm moving." The same objection to the
   general doctrine is hinted at by Mr Mill, [18] and stated fully, and
   with all his usual ingenuity, by Hume, in his famous chapter on the
   idea of "necessary connection."

   Now, it is not to be disputed that the point upon which this objection
   rests is indubitable--viz., that it is only through the intermediate
   agencies of the nerves and muscles that the act of volition goes forth
   in corporeal movement. Volitions produce nervous action, and this
   action again expresses itself in outward movement. We have not,
   therefore, and cannot have, any proper consciousness of this movement.
   The volition or act of will itself is all of which we are properly
   conscious. But in this act, as we conceive, we have already sufficient
   basis for our theory. For what is this simple movement of the will but
   the Ego expressing itself? And in this original act of self-expression
   we have already, according to our view, the idea of cause. Will it be
   said that, apart from resultant motion or special activity, we could
   have no evidence of such self-expression? It may be readily granted
   that, had we possessed no experience of volition passing into activity;
   had, in truth, the present constitution of things been entirely
   different from what it is--for this is really what is asserted,--in
   such a supposed case there is no certainty that we could have had such
   evidence, or that--which is the same thing--volition could have been to
   us any longer a fact. We cannot tell; we have simply again to reply
   that we pretend to no elements of knowledge apart from experience in
   the sense here intended. All we know is, and can be, only known to us
   within the conditions of our actual being; in other words, within the
   sphere of experience. What we might or might not have known out of this
   sphere, it is utterly idle to conjecture, as we cannot, in the nature
   of the case, transcend it, and survey ourselves from a point above it.
   Thus, in the present case, the sense of will or power is to us a fact,
   given in the first dawn of self-consciousness, and repeated in every
   moment of self-consciousness. It is implied in every forth-putting of
   our being. It lies at its root, and our whole mental life is only a
   continual passing of it into activity. That which is specially called
   the Will is, as already represented, implicitly contained in this
   original affirmation of self, in which all our knowledge begins.
   Special acts of freedom are merely special manifestations of a power
   quickened in us, or, more truly, which constitutes us (the Me) from the
   first. It is by no means necessary, therefore, that we should be
   directly conscious of corporeal movement, as the special result of an
   act of volition, in the sense set forth by M. de Biran, and questioned
   by Sir W. Hamilton and others, before we can attain the idea of cause.
   This idea emerges far more deeply in our spiritual life than is thus
   implied, and is quite independent of such special realisations as are
   here connected with it.

   Let us review, then, the conclusion at which we have arrived; the
   meaning of causation as thus determined. A cause we have found to be
   truly coincident with an agent; to have its primitive type in the Ego,
   the living root of our being; and to be specially represented in that
   which constitutes the highest expression of our being, Free Will. A
   cause, therefore, implies Mind. More definitely, and in its full
   conception, it implies a rational will.

   Let this conclusion be fairly pondered, and it will be found to sustain
   itself irrefragably. The Ego, which in its first dawn and highest life
   alone gives us the idea of cause, is simply the rational being which we
   call by the name of Mind. It is this being, no doubt, apprehended
   predominantly on the side of activity. But this activity, apart from
   the reason in which it inheres, and which it expresses, is nothing. We
   can never subtract the one element and leave the other. We have been in
   the habit, indeed, of speaking of different mental faculties; but the
   mind is really one, and not a separable congeries of powers. Free will
   is and can be nothing else, therefore, than the highest or consummate
   expression of our rational being or mind; and a rational will the only
   fully answering idea to that of Cause. The one idea is the only
   commensurate of the other. The latter only exhausts itself, and finds
   rest, in the former.

   We will now be able to understand the true character of the causation
   which we apprehend in nature. In the light of our spiritual
   consciousness, we everywhere perceive in nature a deeper meaning than
   it contains. We apprehend a living power in its continual flow. This is
   the general expression of what reason demands. It never stops short of
   this. But already it contains a higher and more explicit truth.
   Already, in its lowest indications, it points to one original,
   comprehending Will. The savage or childish apprehension of nature, as
   animated in its different movements by separate voluntary agents like
   ourselves, [19] is a mere dim and temporary expression of the rational
   necessity which knows no satisfaction till, driven upwards, it rests in
   the idea of one all-pervading Power--an Ultimate Cause.

   According to this whole view, there is no such thing as mere physical
   causation. What is so denominated is of course a reality; but inasmuch
   as it is only in virtue of our spiritual life that we could ever find a
   cause in nature, this term is truly inapplicable to physical phenomena
   per se: nature cannot give what it does not contain. Physical causes,
   apart from the idea of a will in which they originate, and which they
   manifest, have no meaning. Remove the one idea, and the other
   disappears. It is assuredly only in the reflection of a POWER beyond
   them, and in which they are contained, that such causes are or can be
   to us anything but antecedent phenomena. It is only as the expression
   of such a Will or Power that the physical order of the universe is
   recognised as caused. And this recognition is truly ineradicable and
   necessary; in no way affected by the discoveries of science; still
   asserting itself by the side of the most extended of these discoveries.
   Let science expose the domain of physical order as it may, Will is
   still present as its implicate and only explanation. And this Will,
   according to what we have already said, is no mere naked potentiality.
   We know nothing of Will apart from Reason; the one is to us merely the
   peculiarly active, the other the peculiarly intelligent, side of the
   same spiritual energy. They unite and form one in what we
   comprehensively call Mind, which we therefore recognise as the only
   adequate source and explanation of the universe.

   It will be observed that we have confined ourselves to the fact of
   causation--what it implies. Our aim has been to find a true and final
   explanation of what we mean by a "cause." The principle of causality,
   in its characteristic of irresistibleness and necessity, has been
   rather assumed than dealt with: and rightly so; for the principle,
   under one form of explanation or another, cannot be said to be in
   dispute. The real and important subject of dispute is unquestionably
   what the principle--admitted to be one which conditions human
   Intelligence--involves. What is its import? Does it lead us upwards
   merely from one link of sequences to another; or does it necessitate
   our finding, in all sequences, a higher element in which alone they
   inhere? Is Cause, in short, Antecedence or Power? This is the essential
   question, and it is this to which we have endeavoured to give an
   answer.

   [14] There seems to be an inaccuracy and misapplication of language
   here, singular in a writer generally so clear-sighted and accurate as
   Mr Mill. For surely the regular rising of the sun above the horizon,
   or, in other words, the diurnal revolution of the earth, is, if
   anything can be said to be so, a part of "the present constitution of
   things." According to this "constitution," then, it may be said to be
   truly known that night will always be followed by day. The terms of
   this sequence, even on his own interpretation, are therefore
   unconditional, and yet we do not regard them as cause and effect. We
   can, no doubt, conceive the sun not to rise above the horizon,
   compatibly with the "general laws of matter," a phrase by which Mr Mill
   makes his meaning more distinct and unequivocal. But, in the first
   place, the "general laws of matter," while they MAY be conceived by us
   apart from such a special result of their operation, can yet be only
   said to be really known to us in their varied actual results, apart
   from which they are simply abstractions; nonentities, on a mere
   physical view of things; and, in the second place, we can as easily
   conceive, it appears to us, the general laws of matter themselves to
   cease, or be entirely changed. The unconditionalness, therefore, which
   he considers to attach to them, and which he believes a "distinction of
   first-rate importance for clearing up the notion of Cause," does not
   seem, even in their case, to be available to any further extent than in
   reference to the constant experience respecting day and night. The fact
   is, as shown in the text, that the constant succession of day and night
   is not regarded in the light of cause and effect, simply because it is
   not succession, but something else, and quite distinct, with which the
   mind, directly and initially, concerns itself in pronouncing this
   relation.

§ I.--CHAPTER III.

  DOCTRINE OF FINAL CAUSES.

   THE conclusion of the preceding chapter already clearly pointed to what
   we mean by the doctrine of Final Causes. The idea of causation we found
   to resolve itself into that of the operation of a rational will or mind
   in nature; and this operation, looked at deductively from a theological
   point of view, is neither more nor less than the doctrine before us.
   But while thus implicitly given in our previous argument, this
   doctrine, in its distinctive form, deserves from us a further and more
   attentive consideration. It deserves this especially, on account of the
   obscurity and misrepresentations in which it has been involved.

   There is no doctrine which has been more misunderstood. The scientific
   applications of it have been confounded with its genuine theological
   import, and abuses resulting from the former perversely passed over to
   the discredit of the latter. What it really signifies, what is the
   comprehensive meaning in which the doctrine must be held, if it is to
   be held at all; has been often as little understood by its supporters
   as by its opponents.

   The notion of Final Causes, for example, is frequently represented as
   if limited to organic or physiological phenomena. In a purely
   scientific relation, viewed as a method of scientific discovery, it may
   be rightly so limited; although, even in this respect, it seems only an
   absurd perversion of the doctrine, and not the doctrine itself, which
   can be truly held as an invalid guide of inquiry in any department of
   nature. It is only the confusion of its genuine meaning with an
   impertinent and barren curiosity,--the very opposite of its inquiring
   and reverent gaze,--which can render it abusively applicable to any
   order of phenomena. [20] But certainly, whatever view may be held on
   this point, there cannot remain any doubt in the minds of those who
   really understand the doctrine, that, in its higher theological meaning
   and relation, it is equally applicable to all orders of phenomena,
   organic and inorganic. It is true that, even in this higher relation,
   the doctrine has been especially applied to the organic products of
   creation, so that the argument from Design or Final Causes is probably
   interpreted by many, if not most minds, with exclusive reference to
   these products,--the wonderful structures of the vegetable and animal
   kingdom. But this has simply arisen from the fact, that design is
   capable of being more conspicuously traced in these structures, than in
   the more general and comprehensive phenomena presented to us by the
   inorganic kingdom. Assuredly it will not for a moment bear to be
   affirmed that the principle of design, rightly apprehended in the
   fundamental form in which alone it concerns the theistic argument, has
   any real application to the one class of phenomena which it has not to
   the other. It may have, in the one case, a more manifest application,
   and one, therefore, more effective for purposes of popular
   argumentation; but, beyond all question, there are no logical grounds
   on which the principle can sustain itself in the one case and not in
   the other. These grounds are equally valid or invalid in both cases.
   Supposing we admit them, design, the operation of Mind, is everywhere
   recognised in nature. Supposing we reject them, every such conception
   as that of "design," or "final cause," "end" or "purpose," disappears
   from nature. [21]

   Let us then look still more closely at these grounds, that we may be
   thoroughly satisfied of their validity. Why is it that we apprehend
   everywhere in phenomena of order the operation of a rational will or
   mind? Simply because we cannot help doing so; because the laws of our
   rational being compel us to do so. These will not permit us to rest
   short of Mind as an ultimate explanation of such phenomena. The
   theistic position, therefore, is based on an inherent rational
   necessity. We do not know where it could be so strongly based. We do
   not know, indeed, where else it could be based.

   But this strong foundation is not conceded to us without controversy.
   How plainly the right and dignity thus claimed for Mind are repudiated
   by a certain school of thinkers, we have already seen; and the special
   arguments by which our position has been assailed by the same able
   writer with whom we have already engaged, and who so eminently, in the
   present day, represents the school in England, certainly deserve
   examination. These arguments no doubt originate in a fundamental
   opposition of philosophical principle, to which the discussion must
   always at length be driven back, and to which we might, therefore,
   confine ourselves; this opposition being neither more nor less than the
   old one of Spiritualism and Empiricism, Platonism and Epicureanism. Yet
   it may serve in some respects to strengthen our ground and elucidate
   the truth, to examine the more special reasoning of Mr Mill.

   It is wholly denied by this writer that the tendency to find Mind
   everywhere in nature rests on an ineradicable necessity of reason. This
   is simply "the instinctive philosophy of the human mind in its earliest
   stage, before it has become familiar with any other invariable
   sequences than those between its own volitions and its voluntary acts."
   [22] . . . "Sequences entirely physical and material, as soon as they
   had become sufficiently familiar to the human mind, came to be thought
   perfectly natural, and were regarded not only as needing no
   explanation, but as being capable of affording it to others, and even
   of serving as the ultimate explanation of things in general." [23] And,
   as illustrations of this, are instanced the early Greek philosophers,
   some of whom held that Moisture, and others that Air, was the universal
   cause. These are brought forward as examples to show that mankind, so
   far from regarding the action of matter upon matter as inconceivable,
   have even rested satisfied with some material element as a final
   principle of explanation. Others--and he mentions Leibnitz and the
   Cartesians--are also stated to have been so little of our way of
   thinking, that they found the "action of mind upon matter to be itself
   the grand inconceivability," to get over which they were forced to
   invent their respective theories of Pre-established Harmony and
   Occasional Causes. On the case of the Cartesians he dwells particularly
   according--to whose system, he says, "God is the only efficient cause,
   not quâ mind, or quâ endowed with volition, but quâ omnipotent." [24]

   The best way of approaching the strength of our argument will be
   through these supposed illustrations of the adverse position. In the
   two latter instances, the real point at issue is certainly to some
   extent mistaken. The ground of discussion is at least so shifted as to
   draw off attention from that point. In speaking, for example, of the
   action of matter upon matter, and again of that of mind upon matter,
   the special idea suggested is clearly as to the mode of action in the
   one case and the other, as if the real point were the conceivableness
   of this mode in the respective cases. But this is not in any sense the
   true question. The Theist does not profess to comprehend or explain the
   difficulty thus suggested. The mode of action of mind upon matter, or
   indeed the mode of connection between matter and matter, is
   acknowledged to be wholly inscrutable. The point in dispute is simply
   the fact of action or efficiency at all. In the one case--that is to
   say, when we apprehend Mind as the cause of phenomena--we are satisfied
   with this apprehension, not because we understand how Mind is the
   cause--or, in other words, how it acts upon matter--but simply because
   we know, in our own experience, that it does so act. We rest in Mind as
   a source and explanation of action generally, just because it is to us
   all this, and we know of nothing else that is this.

   It is true that Leibnitz and the Cartesians did not regard the human
   mind in this light. Denying, as they did, finite efficiency, they could
   not, of course, rest in it as an explanation of action, any more than
   they could hold one physical element or event to be an explanation of
   another. Within the sphere of finite existence they did not recognise
   any efficiency; and hence the theory of Pre-established Harmony on the
   one hand, and that of Occasional Causes on the other, to account for
   the connection between finite spirit and matter. But so far was either
   Leibnitz or the Cartesians from denying the fact of efficiency as
   applied to the Divine Being, that it was just this fact they called in
   to solve the absurd difficulty in which they had involved themselves.
   They could not conceive the action of finite mind upon matter. The fact
   was not enough for them; but they must understand it logically; and,
   being unable so to understand it, they arbitrarily called in the Divine
   efficiency to explain it. In the case of the Cartesians this is clearly
   admitted by Mr Mill; and it is undeniable in both cases, whatever may
   be said to the contrary. [25]

   It does not seem, therefore, that the views of these philosophers, in
   their true and comprehensive sense, avail much for Mr Mill's position.
   It is, indeed, admitted that they did not recognise the fact of limited
   efficiency in the human mind, from which we rise argumentatively to the
   fact of the Divine efficiency, and that in their respective
   philosophies, accordingly, they did not leave any rational basis for
   Theism. We willingly abandon them as consistent theistic thinkers. Yet
   they were so far from resting short of the theistic conclusion--the
   conclusion of a Supreme Mind efficiently connected with things in
   general--that their respective theories rest expressly on the
   supposition of Divine efficiency. Mr Mill's refinement as to the Divine
   efficiency being apprehended, not quâ mind or quâ volition, but quâ
   omnipotence--even if we were disposed to grant it--does not in the
   least militate against our view, according to which, as will be
   immediately more fully explained, it is only as resting in Mind that
   power has any meaning, or can have any. So far, therefore, from denying
   the theistic position--or, in other words, the fact of a Supreme
   Rational Will as the only explanation of things--it was in truth the
   peculiar error of Leibnitz and the Cartesians, that they pushed this
   position to such excess as to overbear the no less valid fact of the
   finite rational will, through which alone, according to our whole
   apprehension, the higher fact can be consistently reached.

   A little examination will equally avail to obviate the force of the
   more pertinent illustration, drawn from the case of the early Greek
   philosophers, and even to show how its more correct understanding may
   be turned in favour of our position. These philosophers, says Mr Mill,
   found in some single physical element a sufficient explanation of
   things. If they could rest satisfied with such an explanation, this is
   a proof that there is no inherent mental necessity which compels us to
   place Mind at the head of things as their ultimate cause. But admitting
   that Thales [26] and Anaximenes acknowledged in the physical
   elements--the one of Water, and the other of Air--not only a primordial
   principle or prima materia, but an ultimate cause or final explanation
   of things, it may be shown beyond dispute that they only held such an
   opinion in virtue of their having recognised in Water or Air
   respectively a peculiar formative energy. To borrow Mr Mill's own mode
   of explanation, with a fairer application than he makes of it, it was
   not quâ matter (this or that material form), but quâ the vital Energy
   or Soul [27] with which they were supposed endowed, that these elements
   were apprehended to be the fountain of existence. The idea of Originant
   force was what they mainly associated with the arche` which they
   sought, whatever may be the merely material character which its name
   now suggests to us.

   Now, in this recognition of the ancient Grecian philosophy, we have
   really, it is important to observe, the essential germ of our doctrine.
   Even if it be indisputable that the clear conception of the Ultimate
   Cause as intelligent were a later product of the same philosophy, it
   can be shown that in the acknowledgment (under whatever special form)
   of Force as the original spring of existence, there is already enfolded
   the great truth, of Mind forming the only final explanation of things.
   The grounds on which we rest this assertion will be immediately
   apparent. Rightly regarded, therefore, these early Grecian
   speculations, so far from being opposed to our position, furnish a
   powerful testimony to its strength. For what were they, one and all of
   them, but attempts to rise to the origin of things, and to apprehend
   them in the light of some single Living power or principle? To
   endeavour to represent them as evidences of the mind's capacity to rest
   short of such a living supernatural Cause, is profoundly to mistake,
   not only them, but the whole course and meaning of human speculation.
   [28]

   The position, indeed, on which we rest--viz., the irrepressible
   necessity of the human mind thus to ascend to the origin of things, and
   to apprehend this origin as a Power above nature--is a position that so
   directly carries with it its own evidence, that, like all self-evident
   truths, it is difficult to deal with it argumentatively. All Religion
   and all Philosophy testify to it. They express, the one, the deep
   feeling of the common consciousness, the other the modified but no less
   genuine feeling of the reflective consciousness, that there is a Higher
   Source from which flow all the visible changes that occur around us. So
   far from this being the mere dictate of that instinctive philosophy of
   the human mind which disappears with the advance of science, it is the
   utterance of an ineradicable rational necessity, which never changes,
   however it may change its mode of expression. In one case the Ultimate
   Source or Power may be so rudely apprehended, and in another so refined
   and unified, that the two results may seem not to represent the same
   conviction; but it is the same rational necessity that speaks in both.
   It is the same truth, however in certain cases obscured and even
   distorted, that forces itself upon us. Men cannot rest in any lower
   truth: they are driven unceasingly upwards, till they rest in some
   ultimate and comprehending Power. They cannot be satisfied with any
   mere endless series of changes, which does not originate in such a
   Power, however various may otherwise be their notions of it. Every
   ascent along the chain of mere natural facts, leaves the mind still in
   search of an Origin beyond nature. Here alone it searches no more, but
   rests in peace. "We pass from effect to cause, from sequence to
   sequence, and from that to a higher cause, in search of something on
   which the mind can rest; but if we can do nothing but repeat this
   process, there is no use in it. We move our limbs, but make no advance.
   Our question is not answered, but evaded. The mind cannot acquiesce in
   the destiny thus presented to it, of being referred from event to
   event, from object to object, along an interminable vista of causation
   and time. Now this mode of stating the reply--to say that the mind
   cannot thus be satisfied--appears to be equivalent to saying that the
   mind is conscious of a principle in virtue of which such a view as this
   must be rejected; the mind takes refuge in the assumption of a First
   Cause from an employment inconsistent with its own nature." [29]

   But this irresistible tendency to believe in some Power above nature is
   not in itself, it may be said, commensurate with the position we have
   laid down--viz., that Mind is the only finally valid explanation of
   order. It gives us merely the vague idea of some First Cause. Now of
   course we do assert that the conception of Intelligence is plainly
   present in that most universal form of the faith in a First Cause to
   which we have appealed, and on which, in the last case, our position
   rests. We are content to accept this faith, in all its variety of
   explicit meaning, for what it is in itself simply and
   incontrovertibly,--viz., a testimony to some Higher Power. But what we
   do assert is, that this faith in the vaguest form implicitly contains
   the idea of Mind. For the lower fact has only existence in and through
   the higher. Mind is to us the only analagon of power or force. Our
   self-consciousness--according to the whole scope of our previous
   argument--supplies us with our only type of efficiency. Apart from, and
   independently of, Mind, there is no reason to think that the conception
   of force could have ever arisen within us. However, then, the generic
   element Intelligence may, in certain cases, be concealed behind mere
   Power, we only require to analyse and carry out the true meaning of the
   latter in order to find the former. Power may perhaps be held apart
   from Mind; but as it only comes through the latter, it certainly, as a
   fact, everywhere involves it, and has a constant tendency to return
   into it. It is true, there are states of society in which, either from
   gross ignorance or an overdriven speculative rage--which is no less, in
   the most real sense, ignorance--the higher and more comprehensive
   significance is lost sight of, or does not distinctively emerge; but it
   is equally true that such states are abnormal and temporary, and that
   the narrower and more special idea can nowhere be long or consistently
   held without expanding into the other. Power can only permanently
   assert itself as the acknowledged attribute of Mind.

   To those who have not thoroughly reflected on the subject, this may not
   seem an obvious conclusion; but there is nothing appears to us at once
   more true, and more important to be kept in view. Let it but be granted
   that we obtain the idea of force solely from the conscious operation of
   our own minds--and it does not seem, according to all we formerly said,
   and even according to the express basis of materialism, that this
   admits of any dispute,--and let it further be admitted that it is this
   idea of power or force in which alone we can ultimately rest in our
   impelled ascent to the Source of things,--it seems impossible that we
   can help recognising this Source as Intelligent, when it is only
   through the conscious fact and operation of our own intelligence that
   we have the idea with which it is identical. Power being only known to
   us at all as the expression of Mind, the Ultimate Power necessarily
   becomes to us an Ultimate Mind. Let it be, that the dim unexamined
   promptings of consciousness may permit us to rest for a little, and may
   even permit races, in whom intelligence, save as a blind force, is
   scarcely developed, to rest for ages, in the mere vague conception of
   Power in the external universe, this conception can never fail, in the
   clearer working of consciousness, to be transferred into its full
   symbol--Mind. [30] We can no more, in fact, help making Mind objective,
   and apprehending it as the only ultimate cause or explanation of
   things, than we can help recognising existence under the forms of our
   mental constitution at all. The one result is simply the carrying out
   of the other.

   This is the final view of our position; and so clearly is it felt to be
   so, that it will be found that the opposite school of thinkers have
   retreated thither in an attitude of denial. This is felt to be the last
   and essential point on either side, and appears to us to be clearly
   indicated as such in that remarkable passage of Mr Mill which we quoted
   in the outset. Let it be admitted that Mind is the only efficient cause
   of things with which we are or can be acquainted: does this entitle us
   to place it at the head of nature? Because Mind is to us the only
   conceivable origin, does this justify us in making it the origin of
   things in general? Have we any right, in short, to apply the limited
   modes of our rational conceptivity to the universe? This appears to be
   a fair statement of the ultimate question. Mr Mill, indeed, might
   repudiate this statement. His eagerness to argue the question of
   efficient causes on the lower ground of their rejection not being
   incompatible with the "laws of our mental conceptivity," would seem to
   imply his willingness to abide by what might be proved to be the true
   character of these laws. But we think it plain beyond dispute, that the
   true source of his views lies in that deeper scepticism which treats
   the human soul as a mere product of nature, whose essential modes of
   conception do not necessarily mirror, in any true sense, the universe.
   And this position, which is more implied than asserted in his work, is
   openly and explicitly assumed by other writers of the same school.
   Human ideas are denied any correspondent relation to the Divine
   Existence. The attempt to bring the universe within the forms of man's
   reason, is represented as being equivalent to the old sophistic canon
   of "man the measure of things." "At all times," writes Mr Lewes, "man
   has made God in his own image; he has idealised and intensified his own
   nature, and worshipped that. This he has ever done; this, perhaps, he
   ever will do. But we who, in serene philosophy, smile condescendingly
   on the ill-taught barbarian, whom we find attributing his motives, his
   passions, his infirmities, to the Creator of all--we who shudder at the
   idea of such anthropomorphism, how comes it that we also have fallen
   into the trap, and, having withdrawn from God the investiture of
   Passion, persist in substituting for it an abstraction named Reason? Is
   not God conceived to be pure Reason--omnipotent Intelligence? and as
   Intelligence is Lord and Master of this Universe, so what Intelligence
   recognises as perfect or imperfect, must be perfect or imperfect." [31]

   This last assertion of materialistic infidelity deserves particular
   attention, for it embraces the whole sum of the question between it and
   a theistic Philosophy. It presents, we feel assured, the only
   consistent argument by which this Philosophy can be assailed. And it is
   full of pregnant meanfor the great issue at stake in Natural Theology,
   that it should become manifest that the validity of its conclusions can
   only be consistently disputed on grounds which can be shown to involve
   the negation of all Philosophy and all Theology, and which spring from
   a mode of thought essentially hostile to those highest expressions of
   truth which we so deeply venerate in Christianity.

   Let us see more particularly what this assertion involves. When it is
   alleged that the facts of the universe are not necessarily
   correspondent to the modes of human reason, what is implied?
   Undoubtedly this, that however man may observe and classify the facts
   of nature, these facts can never become to him truth, for it is only
   the light of interpretation with which his reason invests them, that
   makes them to him TRUTH. This, however, is called by our Positive
   Philosophers "anthropomorphism," and the boundless Life of the universe
   is represented as unwarrantably confined within the forms of man's
   interpretation. It is surely enough to say, in answer to such a view,
   that it is not possible to conceive how man could have ever known truth
   save under the conditions of his reason; and to allege, therefore, this
   necessary condition of his having any knowledge in proof of the
   weakness and incompetency of that knowledge, is simply a desperation of
   scepticism so ridiculous that we might well be pardoned for not
   attempting any reply to it. Whether or not there be any other truth in
   regard to the universe than that which the forms of his reason compel
   him to accept as such, must be to man an utterly idle question. There
   can be no other truth to him than that which he is thus compelled to
   accept. To state the matter still more pertinently, let it be admitted
   to be a fair hypothesis that there may be efficient causes in the
   universe entirely different from that of which alone he has, or can
   have, any idea, it yet remains a fact, that the universe is to him only
   conceivable as the production of Mind--Intelligent Power. It is a fact,
   according to our whole theory, that this conception is one
   inextinguishable in human nature. And the refusal of the Positivist,
   therefore, to accept the verdict of human nature on the subject, simply
   amounts to an assertion of utter scepticism--a denial of any truth
   being possible to man.

   Indeed, if the demands of our rational consciousness be repelled in
   this, one of its deepest expressions, it seems a clear inference, that
   not only truth in the highest sense is rendered impossible, but that
   even the foundations of Science are assailed. For if we refuse to
   accept the rational interpretation of nature in its full extent, we can
   have no right to accept it to any extent. If it be an inherent
   necessity of our mental constitution--which we have so fully shown it
   to be--that we recognise Mind in nature as its source, and we refuse
   that recognition, we thereby impugn the veracity of the human
   consciousness altogether, and leave no foot-hold fbr truth of any kind,
   according to the well-known maxim, which in such an application can
   admit of no dispute, "falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus." The final
   position assumed by Positivism might well, therefore, be left to its
   own refutation; for a position of such a character is self-destructive.
   Positivism is, in fact, essentially, whatever philosophical pretensions
   it may arrogate to itself, nothing else than a species of philosophical
   suicide.

   The condition of all true science, as of all philosophy, lies in a
   totally different view of the relation of the human mind to the
   universe. They essentially presuppose, as the ground of their veracity,
   an original harmony between Mind and nature, so that the former finds
   its own laws in the latter, and rightly relies on the reality of what
   it there finds. Man is thus conceived to stand to the whole world of
   material existence in the light of Interpreter. He is the prophet of
   the otherwise dumb oracle,--the voice of the otherwise silent symbol.
   He looks abroad with a clear confidence, that what he everywhere reads
   in the light of his own consciousness is the very truth and meaning
   which is there, and which he therefore ought to receive. Let this
   confidence be destroyed, and there remains for him no truth or genuine
   science that we can imagine.

   It is important to observe the exact character of the relation thus
   maintained to exist between Mind and nature. The correct perception of
   it dissipates at once all ingenious and plausible misrepresentations
   with which it may be attacked. It is a relation of correspondence or
   harmony as already stated, so that Mind apprehends nature in a faithful
   mirror, and finds a reality answering to its intuitions; but it is not
   asserted to be a commensurate relation in the sense of the old dictum,
   "Man the measure of things." There is a most important distinction
   between the two views, amounting to all the difference between a sound
   and reverent philosophy, and that higher and more vaulting speculation
   which overleaps itself in the attempt to construct the universe from
   the mere abstract forms of human thought. In the latter case, alone, is
   man made the "measure of things," when he aspires not merely to
   apprehend truth, and to stand face to face with it, but to comprehend
   and contain all truth within the limits of his mental conceptivity. In
   the one case man only aspires to the knowledge of God, without which he
   were the most miserable of all beings--that inexplicable contradiction
   which he has been sometimes painted; in the other he aspires to be as
   God--an attitude in which he appears just as ridiculously and falsely
   exalted, as, in the other, he is wretchedly and falsely degraded.

   We approach here that significant opposition in the modes of thought we
   are considering, at which we have already hinted, and which is highly
   worthy of our notice in conclusion. The question before us, resolved
   into this its most general shape, comes undoubtedly to be one regarding
   the whole position and dignity of man in the universe. According to the
   old religious view, on which Christianity, as well indeed as all
   Religion and all Philosophy, rests, man is considered to be not merely
   a creature, making his appearance in the course of nature, but a
   creature, while in nature, at the same time in a true sense above
   it--specially allied to its Divine Source. The perfect expression of
   this only truly religious and philosophic view is given in the
   imperishable language of Scripture--"God made man in His own image."
   The same truth is classically expressed in the memorial words--"In
   nature there is nothing great but man; in man there is nothing great
   but mind."

   According to this view, man, while in the very fact of his present
   existence a product of nature, is yet endowed with capacities which
   exalt him far above it, and place him in a perfectly peculiar relation
   to the universe. He is indeed Matter, but yet Spirit. There is a Divine
   element of conscious reason in him, which asserts its superiority over
   the whole sphere of nature, and validly finds its own laws in all. In
   one aspect of his being, indeed, he is purely natural--a mere element,
   and a very frail one, in the world-progress; but, in another aspect, he
   is truly supernatural, and even the whole universe is his inferior and
   subject. According to the fine thought of Pascal, "Man is but a reed,
   the feeblest thing in nature; but he is a reed that thinks (un roseau
   pensant). It needs not that the universe arm itself to crush him. An
   exhalation, a drop of water, suffices to destroy him. But were the
   universe to crush him, man is yet nobler than the universe, for he
   knows that he dies; and the universe, even in prevailing against him,
   knows not its power." [32]

   "Man is yet nobler than the universe." Here, where clearly centre the
   most significant depths of Christian doctrine, lies also the essential
   doctrine of Theism. The Infidelity which rejects it, therefore, is
   really, probed to its bottom, an infidelity not only in God, but in
   man. Reason is with it only the plaything of time--the growth of
   nature. With the Theist it is the first-born of Eternity--the very
   "image of God." The soul is infinitely higher than all nature, and
   validly, therefore, brings all nature within its sphere, and finds its
   own reflection everywhere in it. Matter is only glorified in the light
   of Spirit. Nature is only beautiful--only, in fact, intelligible--in
   the mirror of EVERLIVING MIND.


   We receive but what we give,

   And in our life alone does Nature live.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [20] This is the simple explanation of Lord Bacon's frequently-quoted
   disparagement of Final Causes. It was not the doctrine itself, in any
   true sense of it, but only the scholastic abuse of it, that he
   condemned.

   [21] The different modifications of the doctrine of Final Causes form a
   very interesting subject, were we reviewing the doctrine historically,
   instead of expounding the right view of it. The double relation of the
   doctrine has of course attracted attention, yet without any definite
   effort, so far as we are aware, to bring into clear harmony the more
   general doctrine, and the special form in which it has been applied in
   physiology. Boyle and Stewart both point to the respective theological
   and scientific uses of the doctrine, but they do not expound the
   relation of the latter to the former, which is all-important both for
   the interests of theology, and the validity of the equally disputed
   scientific principle. Nor do they concern themselves with the
   consideration of the more general and the more special form in which,
   even in a purely theological point of view, the doctrine admits of
   being apprehended and applied. Any obscurity that may seem to rest on
   these respective bearings of the doctrine is, we trust, sufficiently
   cleared up in the course of our discussion, and especially in a
   subsequent chapter, where the peculiar significance of the action of
   design in organic phenomena receives attention.

   [25] See (Logic, vol. i. p. 368) Mr Mill's strange attempt to prove
   that Leibnitz denied the ultimate adequacy of the Divine efficiency to
   account for things in general. Nothing could be farther from the true
   thought of Leibnitz. He merely says that he cannot conceive this
   efficiency working save in certain ways. The fact of the Divine
   efficiency is not in question, but only the mode of its working. The
   following are the words of Leibnitz, quoted and emphasized by Mr Mill:
   "Si Dieu donnait cette loi, par exemple, à un corps libre, de tourner à
   l'entour d'un certain centre, il faudrait ou qu'il y joignît d'autres
   corps qui par leur impulsion l'obligeassent de rester toujours dans son
   orbite circulaire, ou qu'il mit un ange à ses trousses, ou enfin il
   faudrait qu'il y concourât extraordinairement; car naturellement il
   s'ecartera par la tangente." LEIBNITZ'S Works, iii. 446: Ed. Dutens.

   [26] Thales--whose case is out of all question the most in point, he
   having, in virtue of his supposed views, been accused of Atheism--is
   yet expressly stated by Cicero to have only held that the nous or
   Divine Intelligence created all things from water; a statement which at
   least ought to have so much weight as to convince us how little can be
   drawn from the fragmentary memorials of ancient Grecian philosophy to
   determine authoritatively the question before us.

   [27] That this was really the opinion of Anaximenes in regard to Air is
   admitted by Lewes, in his rapid and clever review of the Ancient
   Philosophers in the first volume of his Biog. History of Philosophy, p.
   34; and the admission on his part, as being so truly a thinker after Mr
   Mill's own heart, is significant. Nay, so truly did Anaximenes
   recognise his original principle on the side of activity or productive
   energy, that he made it identical with the soul--the "something which
   moved him he knew not how." While Mr Lewes represents the doctrine of
   Thales as being of a lower character, he yet admits, in his case as
   well, the apprehension of a vital force, as prominent in the supposed
   primordial element, as indeed it is impossible in our view to conceive
   otherwise. He says in a note, p. 34: "When Anaximenes speaks of Air, as
   when Thales speaks of Water, we must not understand these elements as
   they appear in this or that determinate form on earth, but as Water and
   Air pregnant with vital energy."

   [28] It is even to mistake the fundamental law of human development
   expounded by Positivism, according to which man's earliest speculations
   are always of a theological character.

   [29] Dr WHEWELL'S Indications of the Creator, p. 199.

   [30] "Let us ask how the primordial force of pantheism is legitimately
   transformed into an attribute of an intelligence? Let a designer stand
   for an intelligence who is possessed of power, and who intentionally
   adapts means to an end. Design, therefore, will stand for intentional
   adaptation; and from the contemplation of man, we are enabled to make
   the above definitions without transcending the realm of experience.
   When we have made man objective, we can affirm, man can design;' and
   when we contemplate the product of man's design, we find it expressed
   in the terms, adaptation of means to an end,' where neither of the
   terms are psychological, but such are used legitimately in physical
   science. And when, on the other hand, we find in nature the adaptation
   of means to an end, we infer design and a designer, because the only
   circumstances within our experience in which we can trace the
   origination of adaptation, are those in which human mind is implicated.
   And thus what was at first an omnipresent and immortal substance, and
   afterwards an omnipresent and immortal power, becomes transformed into
   an omnipresent and immortal intelligence" We give this quotation from a
   recent work, marked by eminent ability (The Theory of Human
   Progression, p. 481-2), not as coinciding with its representation of
   the mode in which force becomes transformed into an attribute of
   Intelligence (Mind), in so far as that representation is exclusive;
   although we recognise the influence of the process to which the writer
   ascribes the origin of the idea of Intelligence, in educating and
   clearing up this phase of the theistic conception, as indeed our whole
   illustrative evidence is based on such a recognition. In this, however,
   we disagree with the representation of the writer before us,--that we
   recognise Mind as already implicitly given in Force--the higher, as
   already contained in the lower phase of the theistic conception and on
   the very grounds on which he finds design in nature,--viz., that the
   only circumstances within our experience, in which we can trace force
   or origination of any kind, are those in which Mind is
   implicated--because Mind, in short, is to us the only analagon of
   force. Not only does adaptation, as a fact, give Mind, but Force
   (Cause), already in our view, however obscurely, gives it. The study of
   design in Creation does not, as we hold, add Intelligence for the first
   time to our original causal belief. For this belief already in its
   vaguest form only takes its rise in the conscious operation of Mind.
   The manifestations of design are, however, of the utmost value in
   quickening and educating the idea of Mind or Intelligence.

§ I--CHAPTER IV.

  THEISTIC CONCLUSION. (GENERAL LAWS.)

   THE major premiss of our theistic syllogism has been made good,
   according to the validity of our previous reasoning. More than this,
   the theistic conclusion itself, in its primary and most naked form, has
   been made good along with it. In the very nature of the case, the
   question passed over from its initiative and abstract, to its direct
   and conclusive statement. The minor premiss was held as implied; and
   the essential question came to be whether a mode of conception, valid
   in certain human applications, was valid in reference to nature at
   large--whether, in short, Mind, admitted to be to man the only
   efficient cause, was yet entitled to be considered the only efficient
   cause and final explanation of the universe.

   We have claimed this position for Mind in virtue of a rational
   necessity, which will not allow us to rest short of such a conclusion.
   More particularly, we have endeavoured to vindicate it by determining
   the true nature of causation, which we find to be always a relation of
   efficiency, and which, therefore, at the very first, carried us beyond
   the mere range of physical sequences to some Power in which they
   originate. This Power can be nothing else than a Mind, as it is only in
   the fact and conscious operation of our own minds that we have the
   conception of power at all. The rational necessity on which the
   argument thus rests can only be consistently set aside by denying the
   veracity of our rational being altogether, and so destroying the
   foundations of all science and philosophy whatever. Mind is found in
   nature as a whole, and held to be its only ultimate explanation on the
   very same grounds on which we apply to nature the forms of our mental
   life at all. The theistic conclusion is only the fair result of the
   rational interpretation of nature carried out.

   The conclusive sum of our previous argument gives us, then, when fully
   expressed, an Intelligent First Cause of nature. The root of this
   conclusion, however, is not in external nature, but in our rational
   consciousness. Nay, it emerges in what is distinctively called our
   moral consciousness. It starts from this as its special source. But,
   inasmuch as our spiritual life is a unity, this distinctive origin of
   the theistic conception does not affect, as some would seem to think,
   the appropriate significance and validity of the general argument from
   design. It only points to the deep harmony which underlies the whole of
   the theistic evidence. It only indicates where the links of that
   evidence gather up into a final and irrefragable postulate of our
   spiritual being.

   Before passing from this branch of our subject, there is a relation of
   it which it may be well to consider,--with such perverseness has it
   been misinterpreted and misapplied. It has been held that our
   conclusion is at variance with the results of Science. Science gives
   us, as the final expression of phenomena everywhere, general laws, to
   which the phenomena may all be traced back, and upon which they seem to
   depend. It is simply the aim of Science to discover these laws in every
   department of nature, and so to give to man a greater mastery over its
   multiplied resources. It is not, perhaps, much to be wondered at that,
   in the proud and continued triumph with which Science has pursued her
   course, there should have been some of her votaries who believed
   themselves not only exposing the domain of nature, but revealing the
   last truths which it concerns man to learn. And while the great
   conclusion of Theism has been thus deliberately discarded by certain
   minds, it has been felt by many more as if that conclusion were somehow
   dangerously affected by the discoveries of Science.

   It will afterwards be our aim, in a more special way, to show how
   little the theistic position is affected by the most notable of these
   discoveries; how little, in truth, we can rest in even the most signal
   of general laws as self-explanatory,--as furnishing the last expression
   of truth for the human mind. The fact is, that any such law, instead of
   explaining the phenomena which seem to issue from it, is merely the
   general condition in which these phenomena express themselves, and
   apart from which it has no existence. Instead of the law explaining the
   phenomena, therefore, it might be more truly said that the phenomena
   explain the law, just as a sum in arithmetic gives the answer rather
   than the answer the sum. The true realities are the separate facts. The
   law is only the summary expression by which we hold these facts before
   our mind.

   In the mean time it concerns us to show how finely and truly, in a
   right point of view, the highest conceptions of Science harmonise with
   the theistic conclusion. It is only an unworthy and absurd
   representation of either that leaves any ground for hostility between
   them.

   It has been presumed, for example, that there is an inconsistency
   between a self-acting power and that invariable uniformity which is
   seen to characterise the operations of nature. The order which Science
   discovers everywhere is supposed, in its silent and undeviating march,
   to exclude any personal agency. This agency is apprehended as something
   necessarily arbitrary, and hence as conflicting with general laws.
   Volition, in short, and law or order, are conceived of as incompatible
   realities; and the idea of any directing Volition is held as dispelled
   by the knowledge which Science enables us to acquire of natural
   phenomena, so that we can foretell and even control them. [33] Now,
   nothing can well be imagined more absurd and unphilosophical than such
   a notion of volition applied to the Supreme Being. The only valid
   presumption in the case would be of a totally different character.
   Instead of regularity being supposed inconsistent with the agency of
   such a Being, it would be held as only its appropriate expression. It
   is only the most vicious idea of will, as divorced from reason, that
   could for a moment give rise to a different apprehension. A Supreme
   Will, which is at the same time Supreme Wisdom, we can only think of as
   manifesting itself in order. The actual order of nature, therefore, so
   far from affording a ground of objection to the fact of superintending
   Volition, is just the very form in which we should rationally conceive
   that Volition to express itself. And the mastery which, by the help of
   Science, we acquire over the resources of nature, instead of destroying
   the notion of such Volition, only serves to bring into clearer view the
   wonderful means by which it works, and through which it provides for
   human happiness. The scientific prevision of phenomena is simply the
   interpretation of the plans of the Divine Reason by that human reason
   which is allied to it, and which only finds in the Divine plans the
   realisation of its own highest conceptions of order.

   The same fundamental prejudice, strange as it may seem, is found even
   to pervade the language of Theology. Looking upon general laws more as
   vast mechanisms than living forces, the theologian too has been apt to
   consider them as inconsistent with the idea of directing Volition, or
   special Providence. They have seemed to him to destroy that living
   guardian presence of God in nature which the heart instinctively
   cherishes: and he has, accordingly, sometimes spoken of them with a
   sort of jealousy. But, according to their right conception, they are
   very far from thus displacing and putting out of view the Divine
   Agency. So very far from doing this, they are truly nothing else than
   the expression of that Agency--the continual going forth of the Divine
   Efficiency. Instead, therefore, of postponing or removing to a distance
   the Divine Presence, they are everywhere simply the manifestations of
   that Presence. To suppose that, because the order of nature is fixed to
   us, the Divine Father cannot exercise through that order a special
   providence towards His children, is simply a presumptuous imagination
   of the most unworthy kind. For to the great Source of Being, who "seeth
   in all His works the end from the beginning," these only are at any
   moment, in all their endless intricacy of action and reaction, even as
   He appoints. The truer view, therefore, would be to regard the whole
   course of Providence, the whole order of nature, as special, in the
   sense of proceeding directly every moment from the awful abysses of
   Creative Power.

   Certainly, if there is any correction needed in our theological
   conceptions and nomenclature on this subject, it is in reference to the
   supposition of a, general rather than of a special Providence--of the
   former as in any true or intelligible sense distinguished from the
   latter. For surely, to conceive of any order of events, or any facts of
   nature, as less directly connected than others with their Divine
   Author, is an absurdity. And what, save this, can be distinctively
   meant by a general Providence, we are at a loss to imagine. Only
   suppose the Deity equally present in all His works, equally active in
   all, and Providence no longer admits of a twofold apprehension. It is
   simply, in every possible mode of its conception, the Agency of God;
   equally mediate in all cases as expressing itself by some means, but
   also in all cases equally immediate as no less truly expressed in one
   species of means as in another. According to this higher and
   comprehensive view, the Divine Presence lives alike in all the Divine
   works. God is everywhere in nature, speaking to us the same language.
   He is equally near to us in all its more ordinary and more striking
   aspects; in the glad sunshine or the gentle shower, as in the boding
   darkness and the dreadful storm; in the fall of the leaf amid the
   fields of autumn, as in the waste of the whirlwind on the desolated
   plains of winter.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [33] The following quotation will show that we do not misrepresent the
   doctrine of Positivism: "The fundamental character of all Theological
   Philosophy is the conceiving of phenomena as subjected to Supernatural
   Volition, and consequently (!!) as eminently and irregularly variable.
   Now, these Theological conceptions can only be subverted finally by
   means of these two general processes, whose popular success is
   infallible in the long run--(1) the exact and rational prevision of
   phenomena, and (2) the possibility of modifying them, so as to promote
   our own ends and advantages. The former immediately dispels the idea of
   any Directing Volition;' and the latter tends to the same result, under
   another point of view, by making us regard this power as subordinate to
   our own."--COMTE'S Philosophy of the Sciences, by LEWES, pp. 102, 103.

SUPPLEMENTARY CHAPTER. [34]

  SPECIAL (GEOLOGICAL) EVIDENCE OF A CREATOR.

   THE doctrine of an Intelligent First Cause, which it has been the aim
   of the foregoing chapter to establish, has been supposed to derive a
   special testimony and confirmation from the facts of Geological
   science. It has been maintained that these facts not only enable the
   Natural Theologian--as in the case of existing organic products--to
   infer a supreme Creative Mind, although this, too, they eminently do;
   but moreover conduct us directly backwards to the presence and agency
   of such a Mind. In a word, they are said to take us out of the region
   of natural cause and effect, and to bring us face to face with the
   great Creative Cause. Lord Brougham, in his review of the memorable
   labours of Cuvier in the department of Fossil Osteology, was among the
   first to draw attention to the distinctive character and cogency of
   this branch of the theistic evidence. Dr Chalmers was disposed to place
   great stress upon it, especially as serving in a direct and tangible
   way to extricate the Natural Theologian from the meshes of Hume's
   sophistry. The question it involves, the reader will at once recognise
   as one which has recently assumed a peculiar prominence and importance
   in scientific discussions.

   Interesting, however, as this question is to the Natural Theologian, it
   is right to observe that we do not hold it to involve the essential
   interests of Theism. The theistic argument no doubt receives a striking
   illumination from the idea of successive creative interpositions,
   manifest in the very structure of the earth and its organic remains. It
   is in the highest degree significant, that, as we turn over the stony
   tablets of the Geological volume, we should not merely be arrested at
   every page with impressive manifestations of that pervading design
   which we perceive everywhere, but at definite intervals should gaze
   with awe upon the very record of Creation, and behold, as it were, the
   finger of Omnipotence in mysterious operation. Yet it is clearly
   evident to us, and deserves to be carefully considered, that even
   should advancing science tend to throw obscurity upon the supposed
   traces of direct Creative Energy, the great doctrine of Theism would
   remain altogether untouched. Even if those finger-prints of the
   Creator, upon which the Christian Geologist has delighted to expatiate,
   should become dim and obliterated, as the eye of Science grows more
   familiar with them, and pierces them with a keener scrutiny, the fact
   of a Creative Presence would not thereby be really affected. God would
   equally, if not so strikingly, live and work in the supposed extended
   development of creation, as in the supposed instances of direct
   Creative Power.

   It is worthy of notice how completely this is admitted by the chief
   expounder of the development hypothesis in our own country. [35]
   However his conclusions may seem, as they certainly seem to us, to
   obscure and pervert, in its highest meaning, the doctrine of Theism,
   they are yet by no means essentially, still less expressly, atheistic.
   On the contrary, the author strongly recognises a Supreme Mind, as
   necessarily implied in all the order of the universe; and, in the most
   recent edition of his work, he has added the special confession, that
   he "believes" in a personal and intelligent God, and cannot conceive of
   dead matter receiving life otherwise than through Him. [36]

   The peculiar question involved is not one which properly affects the
   existence of God, however deeply it may affect all for which that truth
   is important and dear to us. It is truly a question as to the mode of
   the Divine Agency. In the one case as in the other, a Creator is
   admitted; only in the one case it is maintained that we have (in the
   fact of the origin of life, for example--and again, of the successive
   animal species that have peopled the earth) the manifestations of a
   special Creative Energy; in the other, that we have merely the
   manifestations of an advance in the course of natural law--an advance
   not alleged to exclude the Creator, yet the immediate result of an
   inherent impulse originally imparted to matter, and not of a special
   creative fiat.

   In the question thus at issue, the burden of proof lies plainly upon
   the advocate of the development hypothesis. He proposes a special
   theory to account for the ascending phenomena of creation, and the
   successive changes of organic being to which Geology testifies. This
   theory is one which is undeniably at variance with the law which now
   most obviously regulates the production of life. The very words in
   which the author of the Vestiges has expressed his theory imply this.
   The hypothetical development which he defends is one whereby, he says,
   "the simplest and most primitive type, under a law to which that of
   like production is subordinate, gave birth to the type next above
   it--this again produced the next type, and so on to the highest." [37]
   But the law of like production, which he here subordinates to a higher
   and more comprehensive law, is the only one with which, in the
   historical period of creation, we are familiar. As yet we certainly
   possess no valid evidence of a different law--or, in other words, of
   the transmutation of species--and still less of the origin of life
   under any material influences, electrical or otherwise.

   True, it is admitted on all hands, that both vegetable and animal
   organisms are capable of certain degrees of variation and modification
   under external circumstances. There are even, it must be granted,
   certain indications among the lower forms of life of this modifiable
   capacity extending farther than was at first supposed. The alleged case
   of the Ægilops ovata [38] is an illustration. But, admitting all this,
   it will not be contended that any series of facts, as yet discovered by
   science, tends to establish a doctrine of mutation of species.
   Indications there have been sufficiently curious, and fitted to arrest
   the inductive inquirer as to the supposed accuracy of his specific
   distinctions, but certainly no foundation whatever for denying the
   reality of such distinctions. Nay, the fact that organisms generally
   are modifiable within certain limits, but not beyond them--that this is
   the unquestionable law of organic species within the historical period,
   would seem to imply that there is, in all cases, a set boundary to the
   operation of external influences. Definite variability within the range
   of species would seem to form just the most strongly presumptive
   evidence of the substantive and radical distinction of species. This is
   clearly the truth to which the "overbalance of physiological authority"
   testifies. The decision of the authority is thus expressed by Dr
   Whewell: "There is a capacity in all species to accommodate themselves,
   to a certain extent, to a change of external circumstances, this extent
   varying greatly according to the species. There may thus arise changes
   of appearance or structure, and some of these changes are transmissible
   to the offspring; but the mutations thus superinduced are governed by
   constant laws, and confined within certain limits. Indefinite
   divergence from the original type is not possible; and the extreme
   limit of possible variation may usually be reached in a short period of
   time. In short, species have a real existence in nature, and a
   transmutation from one to another does not exist." [39]

   We are aware that it is argued by the advocate of development that the
   law of mutation of species, which we fail to discover in the present
   order of things, may yet have been in active operation throughout the
   lengthened periods of Geological history, in comparison with which the
   years of man's scientific observation of the earth are not to be
   reckoned; but until he can show this, it is at least the safer course
   to abide by the testimony of historical experience. Here and now we
   perceive that the law of like from like is the law of organic
   production; and if the fact of this being the present law will not
   perhaps entitle us to pronounce authoritatively that it was the law as
   well of the ancient periods of the earth, still less, surely, are we
   warranted in admitting the operation of a wholly different law during
   these periods, without a wholly different kind of evidence from that
   which Geology has yet furnished.

   But even if there were as many presumptions in favour of the theory of
   the transmutation of species as there are presumptions against it,
   there would still remain the stubborn and inexplicable fact of LIFE
   (not to mention the higher facts of Intelligence and Responsibility) in
   the way of the adoption of the hypothesis of the Vestiges. For it will
   hardly be seriously maintained that any of the attempts which have been
   made to explain by natural means the genesis of life from dead matter,
   deserves from us other acknowledgment than is ever due to the
   persevering and aspiring efforts of Science, in whatever direction. The
   theory of spontaneous generation, in any shape, has undoubtedly been
   losing rather than gaining ground from the late advances of physiology.
   Suppositions, at one time pretty generally entertained, as to the
   production of infusory animalcula apart from ova, have been pronounced
   by Professor Owen, in conformity with the result of his recent
   researches into the various modes of reproduction with which nature has
   provided these animals, to be "quite gratuitous." [40] The more
   thoroughly, indeed, the minuter facts of nature are apprehended--the
   more the light of science is cast upon them--only the deeper becomes
   the mystery of Life. Instead of our approaching the exposure of this
   secret, we are only the more fully taught that it lies beyond our
   scrutiny, and must for ever baffle our research.

   In the view of the facts thus briefly urged, which leave the
   development hypothesis at the best a mere unsupported, if not
   uninteresting, conjecture, it cannot be doubted that the theory of
   successive creations, defended by all our highest Geologists, is the
   one which has most claim to our acceptance. It proceeds on an obvious
   basis of facts, which not only warrants, but, in the mean time at
   least, seems to necessitate it. In tracing backwards the Geological
   history, we meet with phenomena which do not relate themselves to
   antecedent phenomena in the way of natural cause and effect. The
   supposition of a Supernatural or Creative Cause seems inevitable. Be it
   observed that this theory, according to its just meaning, does not put
   itself forward as a dogma. It does not interdict inquiry, and pronounce
   that there are no links of natural sequence between the phenomena in
   question; it only states that none such have been proved. It does not
   judge nature, but simply interprets it; asserting merely as matter of
   fact, that no such links have been exposed; that in our retrogressive
   ascent along the course of creation we reach gaps in the evolution of
   physical sequences--points which yield no natural explanation, and
   which therefore necessitate a Supernatural. We trace backwards the
   threads of physical relations, till we can go no farther by the boldest
   light of Science, until, by the very penetrating blaze of its torch, we
   are brought face to face with directly Creative Power.

   In thus recognising successive interventions of direct Creative Power
   in the Geological history, we do not for a moment necessarily deny the
   presence of a general order of procession among the phenomena of
   creation. The advocates of development have indeed dexterously sought
   to represent their theory as the only possible conception of
   processional order, applied to the universe. They have put the question
   as between it and any intelligible theory at all. But this is wholly
   unwarrantable; for it surely is not in the least degree necessary that
   we hold that the whole process of creation has been a mere evolution
   from primordial principles at first imparted to matter--that, in the
   language of Dr Whewell, "Life grows out of dead matter, the higher
   animals out of the lower, and man out of brutes," [41] in order to be
   able to discover a true and vast order of progress in the course of
   creation. Such a merely mechanical development appears, on the
   contrary, from its very affectation of simplicity, to be an ambiguous
   and suspicious conception. In any case it can have no claim, a priori,
   to represent the process of creation; and they who discredit it are not
   to be supposed at all insensible "to the wonderful order and harmony,
   the gradations and connections, which run through the forms of animal
   life, and enable the anatomist and physiologist to pass in thought,
   along the unbroken line, from the rudest and simplest organic germs to
   the most completely developed animal structure." [42]

   The idea of an ascensional order of creation is one which, in our
   opinion, the Christian Theist is by no means called upon to dispute;
   and perhaps it will be admitted, on a calm review of the recent
   controversy on the subject, that too much anxiety has been evinced to
   break up the alleged evidence of ascension--of development, in a true
   sense, upon which the author of the Vestiges has founded his
   conclusions. Even should the supposed discovery of vertebrated fossils
   in the lower Silurian rocks, as recently reported, be, in the end, able
   to sustain itself, this would by no means settle the matter against the
   theory of ascent. It would by no means follow that the course of
   creation may not have been, as a whole, from the lower to the higher,
   although we may yet discover the highest animals in the lowest
   stratified rocks. Such a discovery would, no doubt, bear with damaging
   effect against the author of the Vestiges, but it would not at all
   necessarily destroy a rational theory of development. It does not and
   cannot overturn the idea of a regular procession of species; it only
   removes the date and verge of that procession farther back. This is all
   that such a discovery would necessarily imply; and as Theism has
   nothing to dread from the idea of a processional advance from the lower
   to the higher types of being, rightly apprehended--while this idea is
   one which commends itself by its suggestive grandeur--we do not see
   that it should either attract suspicion or provoke refutation.

   If only we hold by the clear conception of the course of nature--or, in
   other words, Providence--being nothing else than a continued
   forth-putting of originally Creative Energy, we shall see nothing to
   surprise us in the gradual rise and ever-expanding development of new
   forms of being along the march of creation. These will seem to us, on
   the contrary, just what we might expect, so far as our expectations
   have any claim to be regarded in the matter; only brighter flushings,
   as it were, of the Divine Presence, here and there, along the extended
   scroll of creation, telling more directly of the radiant Power which it
   everywhere reveals.

   And this view is that which no less tells most decisively against the
   hypothesis of the Vestiges. It is the same vicious metaphysical
   assumption which we have seen to underly the reasoning of the Positive
   School as to the direct action of Divine Will being something
   necessarily irregular--being what is called (in language which
   concentrates the whole perverted essence of the assumption) an
   "interference." It is undoubtedly this vicious idea, as to a necessary
   opposition between law and Creative Will, which lies at the root of the
   whole reasoning of the Vestiges, and forms the most vital question
   between the author and his opponents. But why, we may surely ask,
   should direct Creative action be necessarily conceived of as an
   interference, and, as such, unworthy of the Infinite repose and majesty
   of God? [43] What is law itself, according to the clear admission of
   the writer, but a mode of the Divine Efficiency--an expression of the
   Divine Mind or Will? What is it that constitutes the permanence which
   we peculiarly ascribe to law--to the order of Providence--but the
   continued forthputting of that Efficiency? Were this forth-putting to
   cease any moment, the law would disappear, the course of Providence
   would dissolve and vanish away. Now, because God, for obvious reasons,
   maintains the forth-puttings of His Efficient Energy, after certain
   modes which, collectively, we call Nature, why should this exclude new
   and special forth-puttings of that energy, when He may see meet--in
   other words, when fitting occasions may arise? Why should such fresh
   expressions of Creative Power be supposed to be irregularities,
   "interferences" in the great plan of creation--and not, as according to
   the genuine theistic conception they truly are, parts in the
   development of that great plan contemplated from the first? Is not the
   former supposition the one which truly degrades that Infinite Being,
   "who knoweth all His works from the beginning to the end?"

   The truth is, it is only the most deep-seated anthropomorphism (which
   is yet the peculiar contempt of Materialism) that gives rise to the
   imagination of a conflict between law or order, and the special action
   of the Divine Will, in any case. For if we remove the wholly human
   element of imperfection, all such possible discrepancy disappears. In
   this conception of the Highest, all arbitrariness vanishes, and the
   whole order of nature is apprehended as simply a continued efflux of
   Infinite Power and Wisdom.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [34] The character of the evidence treated of in this chapter
   sufficiently separates it from the general range of merely illustrative
   evidence. This, upon the whole, seemed to be the proper position for
   it.

   [35] This admission is, upon the whole, so clearly and happily
   expressed, that we are prompted to submit it to the reader. "What, in
   the Science of Nature," asks the author of the Vestiges, "is a law? It
   is merely the term applicable where any series of phenomena is seen
   invariably to occur in certain given circumstances, or in certain given
   conditions. Such phenomena are said to obey a law, because they appear
   to be under a rule or ordinance of constant operation. In the case of
   these physical laws, we can bring the idea to mathematical elements,
   and see that numbers, in the expression of space or of time, form, as
   it were, its basis. We thus trace in law, Intelligence. Often we can
   see that it has a beneficial object, still more strongly speaking of
   Mind as concerned in it. There cannot, however, be an inherent
   intelligence in these laws. The intelligence appears external to the
   laws: something of which the laws are but as the expressions of the
   Will and Power. If this be admitted, the laws cannot be regarded as
   primary or independent causes of the phenomena of the physical world.
   We come, in short, to a Being beyond nature--its Author, its God;
   infinite, inconceivable, it may be, and yet one whom these very laws
   present to us with attributes showing that our nature is in some way a
   faint and far-cast shadow of His, while all the gentlest and
   beautifullest of our emotions lead us to believe that we are as
   children in His care, and as vessels in His hand. Let it then be
   understood--and this is for the reader's special attention--that when
   rational law is spoken of here, reference is only made to the mode in
   which the Divine Power is exercised. It is but another phrase for the
   action of the ever-present and sustaining God."--P. 10.

ILLUSTRATIVE (INDUCTIVE) EVIDENCE.

§ II.--CHAPTER I.

  COSMICAL ARRANGEMENTS.

   IN the course of our previous argument we have assumed that nature
   everywhere presents an aspect of ORDER. This we were quite warranted in
   doing from the universal testimony of Science; and on this assumption
   our argument advanced directly to its conclusion. Mind was found
   entitled to stand at the head of nature as its only valid explanation.
   With a view, however, to the complete exhibition of the theistic
   doctrine, it is necessary to return to the minor premiss of our
   syllogism, and unfold it at length. It is only by a detailed exposition
   of the fact of order, as it reveals itself in manifold forms in nature,
   that we can fully show "that there is an all-powerful, Wise, and Good
   Being, by whom everything exists."

   We begin our illustrative survey with the most general and
   comprehensive phenomena that can engage us; those, namely, disclosed by
   astronomy. The celestial arrangements are at once the most simple and
   the most magnificent of which we have any knowledge--the most
   independent, and at the same time the most widely influential, of all
   others. Astronomical science, above every other, has enlarged and
   transformed our conceptions of the universe. Has the grand utterance of
   ancient piety, "The Heavens declare the glory of God," lost anything of
   its meaning in the light of modern discovery? Or have the
   ever-expanding disclosures of the telescope only added to it a depth
   and grandeur of meaning hitherto inconceivable? We will endeavour in
   this chapter to find an answer to these questions.

   The general character of our solar system may be said to be now
   familiar to the common intelligence. It is composed, so far as has
   hitherto been discovered, of eight planetary bodies of what is called
   first-class magnitude, surrounding the sun at different distances, with
   a comparatively numerous group of smaller bodies circling between the
   orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Previous to the year 1845 there were only
   reckoned four of these lesser bodies; but, on the 8th of December of
   that year, a fifth member of the group was discovered by Hencke; and,
   since then, yearly observation has been adding to their number. [44] It
   is, moreover, only a few years since the last we know of the larger
   order of planets was discovered. Previously, Uranus was supposed to be
   the outermost of our system; but, in the year 1846, the independent
   calculations of two students [45] conducted almost simultaneously to
   the discovery of another planetary body removed far beyond the orbit of
   Uranus, and circling round the sun in about double its year. The extent
   of the solar system was thus immensely augmented. Before, it was
   calculated to embrace a portion of space not less than three thousand
   six hundred millions of miles in diameter. But now this vast tract has
   been to our view nearly doubled. Almost twice the distance of Uranus,
   another world has been found attached to our system, and revolving in
   the warmth of our sun.

   But the solar system, stupendous as it is, occupies only a small
   portion of the expanse of space. Even to the eye, that space is seen to
   be peopled with a multitude of starry bodies, of a character quite
   different from those that move around our sun; and the telescope brings
   into view not merely thousands, but millions of these bodies. The great
   zone of the Milky Way, which has in all ages arrested attention from
   its peculiar appearance, is found, on the application of the telescope,
   to verify the conjecture of an ancient philosopher, and to be nothing
   else than a pathway of stars, so densely crowded as to be separately
   indistinguishable to the unaided eye. These countless orbs Science
   teaches us to regard as suns similar to our own, with attendant
   planetary trains, although actual traces of these latter can scarcely
   be said to be yet discovered. Every bright and twinkling point above
   us, that seems to stand as a mere brilliant gem in the nocturnal crown
   of our earth, is probably the luminous centre of a system often far
   exceeding that to which we belong. For, shining as many of the stars
   do, with a brilliancy greatly more intense than that of our sun (Sirius
   is reckoned equal to sixty-three suns), it is only a likely inference
   that they irradiate and control much vaster systems.

   But not only has Science taught us to see in the starry firmament
   unnumbered repetitions of simple systems resembling our own; it has,
   moreover, disclosed binary systems, and even triple and quadruple, and
   higher combinations, all entering into the scheme of the stellar
   universe. The mind is thus not only transported in space far beyond our
   system; the magnitudes and distances with which it makes us familiar
   are not only enlarged beyond all our powers of imagination--the nearest
   star (a Centauri) being not fewer than twenty millions of millions of
   miles away from us, or about seven hundred times farther removed from
   our sun than the planet Neptune;--we are further introduced into wholly
   new orders of worlds, marked by the most wonderful diversities. What
   strange and interesting changes alone must result from the simplest of
   the combinations which we have mentioned! If we suppose, as it is
   allowable to do, that each of the suns in such a system has its
   attendant planets, how novel the physical conditions! how singular the
   complexities of relationship which they must present! "Besides passing
   through the varying climates of a year, depending on its revolution
   around its own luminary, every planet of either system must undergo the
   changes of another cycle, whose course is the great period of the
   Binary system, and which at one of its terms must subject it to the
   influence of two suns virtually in contact! And as to the movements of
   bodies acted on by forces so strange and fluctuating, we can have
   little other idea except that it is a sequence or succession of
   bouleversements, the virtual periodic overthrowing by each sun of the
   independence of the system established by the other, which again is to
   recover itself in so far during the years leading to their elongation."
   [46] If we add to these considerations the well-ascertained fact of the
   diversity of colour which distinguishes not a few of the double stars,
   [47] we shall derive a still more striking impression of the
   peculiarities of Existence to be found in the stellar
   spaces--peculiarities doubtless increasing in novelty and intricacy
   with the ascending complexity of the starry groups. In the language of
   Sir John Herschel, "it may be easier suggested in words than conceived
   in imagination what a variety of illumination two stars--a red and a
   green, or a yellow and blue one--must afford a planet circulating
   around either; and what cheering contrasts and grateful vicissitudes--a
   red and a green day, for instance, alternating with a white one and
   with darkness--must arise from the presence or absence of one or other,
   or both, from the horizon!"

   But all this even by no means exhausts the extent of view or variety of
   cosmical life which the telescope has revealed to us. We are enabled,
   by the light of recent astronomy, to penetrate to still vaster depths
   and hitherto unimagined worlds. In various quarters of the heavens the
   telescope has discovered patches of dim hazy light, now well known by
   the name of Nebulæ. Some of these were from the first recognised to be
   dense clusters of stars, only rendered indistinct and nebulous from
   their immense remoteness; others, however, were supposed to possess a
   quite distinct character--to be portions of diffused gaseous matter
   incapable of being resolved by any telescopic power, but, as was
   conjectured, in the course of being condensed into separate stars. And
   so generally did this view prevail for a while, that an hypothesis was
   built upon it to explain the whole course of cosmical creation. Many of
   the phenomena, however, upon which this hypothesis rested, have been
   found to lose their supposed character of distinction under the
   application of Lord Rosse's magnificent telescope, so recently brought
   to the service of astronomy. Nebulous masses, previously irresolvable,
   have been at once resolved by it. What had seemed only dim patches of
   twilight haze, as yet unformed into suns, are discovered to be already
   systems of countless suns glowing with ancient fire.

   The great conclusion to which these nebulous phenomena everywhere point
   is, that the starry firmament of which our system is a part, is only a
   member of innumerable galaxies of firmaments that people the tracts of
   space. The millions of suns that shoot towards us their arrowy light
   from such immeasurable distances, and the millions of systems attached
   to them, are after all, as it were, an insignificant portion of the
   suns and systems that actually exist. Beyond the limits of our sidereal
   firmament, and with what spaces of desert and trackless gloom
   intervening we cannot in the feeblest degree imagine, there lie other
   firmaments, it may be far vaster and grander than our own. Looking out
   far beyond the milk-white girdle of our own galaxy, we are transported
   into regions where other galaxies lie all around, some of them of the
   most strange and marvellously impressive shapes. "Improbable as it must
   have seemed," says Dr Nichol, [48] "previous to discovery by
   unimpeachable observation, the spiral figure is characteristic of an
   extensive class of galaxies. Majestic associations of orbs, arranged in
   this winding form--branches, as above, issuing like a divergent
   geometric curve from a globular cluster,--these rise up on all sides as
   the telescope journeys onward, supplanting shapes formerly imagined to
   be most simple, because of their obscurity." Unexhausted marvels thus
   crowd upon us as we penetrate into space; for, after all that the
   telescope has even now revealed, we know not what may still lie beyond.
   When we remember that, in order to enable us to see anything by the
   telescope or otherwise, light must reach us from it, may there not be
   firmaments so immeasurably distant as to be beyond our utmost powers of
   vision? So distant are some of the ascertained nebulas that their light
   is not supposed to reach us in less than fifty thousand or sixty
   thousand years. How true may it be, then, that there may be many starry
   shores in the sea of immensity, bright with a beauty of their own, no
   ray from which ever shines on us.

   If we now turn from the first bewildering view of these vast cosmical
   revelations to contemplate them more steadily, we find throughout all
   the august presence of ORDER. Even in those twilight regions, in which
   the telescope is our only guide, and among phenomena whose very
   existence it strugglingly essays to determine, we find ever, along with
   the mere fact of existence, indications of arrangement. Speaking of
   those most recent marvels of cosmical being, the spiral nebulæ, Dr
   Nichol testifies that, mysterious and bewildering as seem such shapes,
   they "have nothing in common with the fantastic creations of a dream.
   It is the essence of these nebulae that they are not formless, but, on
   the contrary, impressed indelibly by system on the grandest scale:
   clearly as a leaf, they have an organism; something has seized on their
   enormous volumes, and moulded them into a wonderful order." [49]

   Passing to our own galaxy, and the diversified phenomena which it
   presents, we can, in the nature of things, trace more distinctly the
   indications of system. Besides the motions to which we have already
   referred of multiple stars around one another, revealing such grand and
   peculiar varieties of order, it may now be said to be established that
   there is a general motion pervading our galaxy. So long ago as 1783,
   Sir William Herschel was impressed with the fact of our sun being in
   movement, and this fact has at length been amply verified. The sun's
   course is found to be towards the constellation Hercules, and the rate
   even of his progress has been calculated. As there can exist no doubt
   that this solar motion is only a type of what prevails among the stars
   generally, we are thus led to the conclusion of a grand galactic
   movement. Whatever credit may be due to Professor Mädler's conjecture,
   that the present position of one of the Pleiades (the star Alcyone)
   represents the apparent position of the common centre of force to the
   firmamental system, there cannot be any question that our sun and the
   other stars are revolving round such a distant centre. And this mighty
   movement, however we may more particularly regard it, is a vast
   harmonious one, shared in by the several orbitual systems. The
   subordinate movements of so much variety and complexity unite in the
   general procession, which sway, as with an instinct of brotherhood, all
   the members of the galaxy. There is no appearance of disorder or
   disruption. One vast government guides the whole.

   As far as we can penetrate, therefore, and wherever we trace existence,
   we trace, at the same time, order. The discoveries of astronomy, in
   their widest and most marvellous bearings, are simply revelations of
   hitherto hidden harmonies.

   And as we descend from these loftier stellar spaces--in which, with all
   we see, we still see so imperfectly--to the sphere of our own system,
   whose magnitudes and movements have been so accurately determined, we
   find the evidences of arrangement to multiply around us. This is only
   what we might expect. While travelling, by the help of the telescope,
   in regions so remote as those of stellar existence, we can but faintly
   note the special combinations which there exist. It is only far-off and
   partial glimpses of those higher mechanisms we can catch. Darkness
   still overhangs the bright route of the telescope. It is enough that
   what we do see everywhere speaks of order.

   But in the contemplation of our own planetary system, we are not only
   able to mark the general presence of order,--we can note and
   appreciate, moreover, the several special conditions entering into the
   construction of the system, and on which, as well as on the great
   pervading energies of attraction and impulse, its maintenance depends.
   These conditions are all so many instances of arrangement. This has
   been recently so well shown by Dr Whewell in his Bridgewater Treatise,
   that nothing almost remains to be added to his impressive argument. We
   merely present one or two of its features.

   Among the most marked characteristics of our system is the luminous
   nature of its central body. Nowhere else, obviously, could light have
   been placed with equal advantage for diffusion throughout the entire
   system. Now, whence this light? It cannot be said that there is any
   necessary connection between the mere matter of the sun and its
   luminousness. According to the conjectures of astronomers, indeed, the
   heat and light of the sun are not supposed to reside in its mass, but
   in a coating or envelope which surrounds it. Why, then, should it come
   to pass that this coating of light should be, among the bodies of the
   system, confined to the sun, just where it is peculiarly adapted for
   use? The mere position of the sun cannot furnish any adequate
   explanation of this. Its position displays the fitness of the fact; but
   we are unable to recognise any necessity for the fact in the position.
   The only admissible conclusion is, that this was an express arrangement
   designed for the purpose which it so obviously serves. Newton was
   particularly impressed with the force of this conclusion. In the first
   of his famous series of letters to Bentley, he has expressed it with
   his wonted simplicity and force. Allowing that matter would collect
   into masses by the power of attraction, he believes that the sun and
   fixed stars might thus be formed, supposing the matter were of a lucid
   nature. "But how," he continues, "the matter should divide itself into
   two sorts, and that part of it which is fit to compose a shining body
   should fall down into one mass and make a sun, and the rest, which is
   fit to compose an opaque body, should coalesce, not into one great
   body, like the shining matter, but into many little ones; or if the sun
   were at first an opaque body like the planets, or the planets lucid
   bodies like the sun, how he alone should be changed into a shining
   body, whilst all they continue opaque; or all they be changed into
   opaque ones, while he continued unchanged,--I do not think explicable
   by mere natural causes, but am forced to ascribe it to the counsel and
   contrivance of a voluntary Agent."

   The uniform character of the planetary motions presents striking
   evidence of order. We find these motions to be all in nearly circular
   orbits in the same direction, and in nearly the same plane. There is
   here surely the clear impress of arrangement. For to what can we
   attribute this uniformity, save to a uniform determination of original
   impulse? "There is but one circle; there are an infinite number of
   ovals. Any original impulse would give some oval, but only one
   particular impulse, determinate in velocity and direction, will give a
   circle. If we suppose the planet to be originally projected, it must be
   projected perpendicularly to its distance from the sun, and with a
   certain precise velocity, in order that the motion may be circular. . .
   . No one can believe that the orbits were made to be so nearly circles
   by chance, any more than he can believe that a target, such as archers
   are accustomed to shoot at, was painted in concentric circles by the
   accidental dashes of a brush in the hands of a blind man." [50] And
   this conviction is greatly heightened when we bring into view the
   further features of the planetary motions. For anything in the nature
   of the case that we can see, any one of the planets might have moved in
   a different direction, or in a different plane; but not one of them
   does so. It is not merely a single uniformity which characterises their
   motions, but they present exactly the same combination of uniformities.
   The inference seems irresistible, that such a combination of identical
   results could only spring from an identity of purpose.

   But the proof of arrangement comes out most strongly when we
   contemplate the great end which these uniformities of planetary
   movement subserve in the maintenance of the system. Had a different
   determination been given to any one of the elements of this movement,
   it is demonstrable that the stability of the system would have been
   impaired. Had, for example, the orbits of the planets been of extremely
   varied eccentricity, instead of being, as they are, nearly
   circular--had they moved in different directions, or in different
   planes, it is undoubted that, under the existing law of gravitation,
   their mutual interferences would have terminated in confusion and
   destruction. Even as it is, the attraction of the planets upon one
   another, as well as upon the sun, results in a partial derangement,
   which, however insignificant over a given space of time, it was for a
   time supposed might, in the lapse of ages, end in breaking up the
   system. Under the influence of their mutual attraction, changes are
   actually going on in the motions of the planetary bodies; the
   eccentricity of the earth's orbit is diminishing, the moon is
   approaching nearer the earth, and its motion in consequence becoming
   accelerated. So slight, indeed, is the course of these changes, and so
   vast the cycle in which they run, that they have been going on
   progressively from the earliest observations to our own times. Yet, if
   they were unlimited, it cannot be doubted that they would at length
   reach a climax of subversion and ruin. And for some time it was really
   uncertain whether our system might not thus be tending, from the
   inherent character of its constitution, to decay. Newton did not
   undertake to pronounce upon the question; but Lagrange and Laplace
   succeeded in showing that this partial derangement, extending over such
   lengthened periods, was yet only of limited operation. After reaching a
   certain stage, reaction ensues. The orbits do not continue to deviate
   in one direction; but they deviate periodically now in this, and now in
   the opposite direction. The planetary perturbations are not
   indefinitely progressive, long as they continue in one direction, but
   oscillatory. After reaching a certain height they return and correct
   themselves. And what chiefly deserves our attention is, that the
   special conditions of this periodical adjustment of the planetary
   system are those uniformities of movement which so prominently
   characterise the various bodies of the system. "I have succeeded," says
   Laplace, "in demonstrating that whatever be the masses of the planets,
   in consequence of the fact that they all move in the same direction, in
   orbits of small eccentricity, and slightly inclined to each other,
   their secular inequalities are periodical, and included within narrow
   limits; so that the planetary system will only oscillate about a mean
   state, and will never deviate from it except by a very small quantity."
   [51]

   When we turn from these special characteristics of the planetary
   movements to the great law expressed in all, and under which they all
   proceed, the same aptitude of appointment meets us. While it cannot be
   said that of all laws that of gravitation is the only conceivable one,
   the only one compatible with the maintenance of the system, it has yet
   been shown, in the clearest manner, that of all others this law is at
   once the most fitting and the most simple. It is owing alone to the
   particular measure of the attractive force that the planets return
   regularly in the same track, preserving with very slight deviations the
   same periods in their revolutions. Had this force varied otherwise than
   inversely with the square of the distance, this regularity in the
   orbits of the planets would have been entirely destroyed. [52] It is
   remarkable, moreover, that this is the only law save that of direct
   distance (otherwise unsuitable) which is the same for spherical masses,
   such as the planets, and for the separate particles composing them.
   This is surely a significant and wonderful provision. The mind is
   filled with a solemn sense of simplicity as it contemplates the varied
   and beautiful operation of such a law, alike binding the dew into
   glistening gems, and holding the planets and the stars in their
   courses.

   On the whole, we perceive everywhere among the celestial phenomena,
   adaptation. Order meets us wherever we turn our gaze. The old atheistic
   notion of chance has wholly disappeared before the discoveries of
   science. Everywhere, therefore, in the course of our survey, the
   theistic conclusion is impressively forced upon us. The agency of a
   mighty Mind, working in all this order, is irresistibly manifested. As
   of old, the "heavens declare the glory of God." In the language of
   Newton, "Elegantissima hæcce compages solis, planetarum et cometarum
   (et stellarum) non nisi consilio et dominio Entis cujusdam potentis et
   intelligentis oriri potuit."

   In this conclusion we might rest securely on the grounds already laid
   down. It is irrefragable, on our general basis of reason. In reference,
   however, to certain objections which have been specially urged against
   it in this region, it deserves some further attention. Astronomy is the
   favourite sphere of the scientific materialist. Whatever sciences may
   still linger within the domain of theology, this is considered finally
   emancipated from its control. Those same facts which to the reverent
   mind of Newton were so irresistibly demonstrative of Divine power and
   wisdom, to the minds of others are only indicative of a vast necessity,
   which, unintelligent in its character, is by no means to be considered
   perfect in its working. And this antagonism of opinion, of ancient
   date, continues to live, and even to develop itself with clearer
   prominence than ever, in our present modes of thought.

   According to the modern school of scientific materialists, the
   planetary and cosmical order is sufficiently explained by the law of
   gravity. It is simply the necessary result of this law, beyond which,
   as an explanation of the universe, we are not competent to go. This
   mode of explanation, if not distinctly announced by Laplace himself,
   has sought confirmation in the tone of his reasoning in different parts
   of the Système du Monde, and especially in his famous cosmogonic
   hypothesis. Laplace certainly discarded all notion of design in
   connection with the planetary mechanism as unphilosophical, and even
   ventured to point out in one instance, in regard to the motion of the
   moon, how it might have been, for the bestowal of light, more
   advantageously arranged. [53]

   M. Comte has however outstripped his master, and declares the
   inconsistency of astronomy not only with the doctrine of final causes,
   but with every idea of religion. He ridicules the grand sentiment of
   the Psalmist with which we set out, and pronounces that to minds "early
   familiarised with true philosophical astronomy, the heavens declare no
   other glory than that of Hipparchus, of Kepler, of Newton, and of all
   those who have aided in establishing their laws." "No science," he
   says, "has given more terrible shocks to the doctrine of final causes
   than astronomy. The simple knowledge of the movement of the earth must
   have destroyed the original and real foundation of this doctrine--the
   idea of the universe subordinated to the earth, and consequently to
   man. Besides, the accurate exploration of our solar system could not
   fail to dispel that blind and unlimited admiration which the general
   order of nature inspired, by showing in the most sensible manner, and
   in a very great number of different respects, that the orbs were
   certainly not disposed in the most advantageous manner, and that
   science permitted us easily to conceive a better arrangement by the
   development of true celestial mechanism since Newton. All the
   theological philosophy, even the most perfect, has been henceforth
   deprived of its principal intellectual function, the most regular order
   being thence consigned as necessarily established and maintained in our
   world, and even in the whole universe, by the simple mutual gravity of
   its several parts." [54]

   The grounds on which we rest the doctrine of final causes, and on which
   we consider it wholly untouched by the discoveries of science, have
   already been sufficiently explained. All, therefore, which demands our
   present attention in this famous classical passage of atheism is, the
   assertion of the necessity and explanatory sufficiency of the law of
   gravity. Have we any right to regard this law as necessarily existent?
   Would it explain the phenomena in question even if it were?

   Now, so far from our having any right to regard the law of gravity as
   necessarily existent, the truth is, that it is a mere assumption to
   speak of this law as existent by itself at all. We know the law in
   certain phenomena--in those orderly manifestations of which we have
   been speaking. It is the expression of the relation of these phenomena,
   but nothing more. It is the name by which we generalise and hold before
   our mind the action of these phenomena, but nothing more. To regard it
   for a moment, therefore, by itself, as a necessary power or property,
   to whose operation we can conceive the cosmical order to be owing, is
   simply to impose upon our imagination by a fiction; and if it is not so
   regarded, it amounts to nothing; it explains nothing. It simply assigns
   for the fact of the cosmical order, the fact; while yet our reason
   imperatively demands an explanatory origin of this fact.

   But even if we allowed the necessary existence of gravity, it would not
   explain the whole order of phenomena before us. Even if we granted it
   to be an independent property working in matter, the position of the
   materialist would not be made good. So far, indeed, it may be admitted,
   according to the Laplacian cosmogony, that the simple operation of
   gravity would account for the successive formation of the planetary
   bodies, and their motion round a common centre; yet how much would this
   still leave unexplained! Given the nebulous mass and the force of
   gravity, it is conceivable that, under the continued action of this
   force, the mass would be broken up and condensed into separate parts,
   each taking a necessary position and assuming a necessary motion. But,
   as has been urged, whence the existence of the nebulous mass itself?
   Whence the peculiar character which enabled it to separate and contract
   in the fitting way, and in no other? Whence the determinate velocity of
   the primitive movement, destined to such results, and no other? Whence,
   particularly, certain phenomena which do not lie in the plane of the
   planetary movements, nor proceed in the same course, although,
   according to the Laplacian view, all the generated motions must lie in
   the same plane, and be in the same direction? [55] To such questions
   the theory gives no answer. Gravity, therefore, even if admitted to be
   the cause of the planetary order so far, entirely fails to account for
   that order as a whole. Even if necessary, it is inadequate as a source
   of explanation.

   In truth, and in conclusion, the Laplacian cosmogony, while interesting
   as a speculation, and serving to point, as by a venturous aim, the path
   of knowledge beyond the existing order of things, is yet, no less than
   any other cosmogonic theory, wholly worthless as a final explanation of
   things. To suppose it for a moment to be such an explanation, were not
   merely to exalt man to be the interpreter, but the God of nature. It
   were to constitute his proud dreams the measure of existence in the
   most daring sense, and verily, with Comte, to make the heavens reflect
   his glory. The highest, which is also the most reverent reason, at once
   shrinks from and contradicts such pretensions. It allows the
   speculation for what it may be worth, but utterly disallows it as a
   final efficient explanation. Here, as everywhere, we can only rest in
   an original self-subsistent Mind, in which the whole cosmical order
   lives, and from which it ever proceeds. This, the conclusion in which
   the great intellect of Newton rested, is that which the common reason
   universally demands, and in which alone it can find satisfaction
   evermore.

§ II. CHAPTER II.

  STRUCTURE OF THE EARTH.

   DESCENDING from the contemplation of the celestial order, in the
   composition of which our globe is only an insignificant element, we
   turn our attention to the massive structure of that globe itself. We
   carry our illustrative survey from the vast regions and unnumbered
   worlds, lying all around us in space, and with which we are only
   enabled dimly to converse, to the bosom of that familiar earth on which
   we dwell, and which everywhere invites our inspection.

   We are prepared to trace order here, as in the far-off regions we have
   been traversing. To the untutored eye, the mass of our earth may seem a
   mere vast conglomeration, even as the heavens seem a mere mazy dance of
   sparkling lights; but as science has disclosed the magnificent system
   of the one, so has it unfolded the special structure of the other. As
   in the heavens we still read in the blaze of modern astronomy the glory
   of God, so in the crust of the earth do we read, in the light of modern
   geology, the impress of Divine power and wisdom. As we confine our
   attention here to the massive construction of this crust, a few words
   will suffice to bring before us the facts which the subject involves.

   The component rocks of the earth are divided into two great
   classes--stratified and unstratified. The latter represent the oldest,
   and, so to speak, the original material of the earth. They constitute
   its solid basement. The foundations of the structure are laid in
   granite. The hard and agglutinated character of these rocks favours the
   supposition that they were originally in a state of fusion. There
   cannot, at least, be any doubt that they are of igneous production.
   Their unworn and angular crystals clearly point to such a mode of
   production.

   The stratified rocks, in all their varieties, present different
   peculiarities of formation. Those which lie immediately above the
   unstratified granitic mass, closely resemble the latter in character:
   they are in fact composed of the same constituents, different only in
   the form and proportion in which they are aggregated. Their crystalline
   texture betrays the same fiery agency which discovers itself in the
   parent rock. At the same time, they bear marks of distinctive origin.
   Their crystals are worn and abraded by the action of atmospheric and
   aqueous influences. Yet the igneous character is here still
   predominant; and, as might be expected, in the fire-locked embrace of
   these primary rocks there is to be found no trace of organic existence.

   Above what we may call this hard and unfossiliferous basis, the
   fossiliferous rocks rise in an ascending series, comprehending various
   systems which geologists have grouped into three great periods or
   epochs, successively called Palæozoic, Secondary, and Tertiary. The
   Palæozoic group, which is next in age to the metamorphic rocks,
   comprehends the vast systems of the lower and upper Silurian, the Old
   red sandstone, and the Coal-measures. The crystalline texture of the
   previous rocks disappears, save among the lowest of these strata, and a
   clayey or sandy texture takes its place, discovering the more powerful
   working of those atmospheric and aqueous influences which we have
   mentioned. Here, also--as the name of the group implies--in the
   Llandeilo flags of the lower Silurian, we find the first traces of
   organic being, which henceforth multiply, in endless and marvellous
   forms, in the onward course of the earth's growth. In the great
   carboniferous system we perceive in a very large degree the operation
   of a further influence in the formation of the earth's crust--the
   submersion and depression, namely, of organic remains. This, in the
   ascending history of our globe, is one of the most extensive of all the
   causes contributing to the earth's formation, in respect not merely of
   vegetable, but also of animal remains. The former, it is well known,
   are the peculiar ingredient of the vast coal-measures. In them we
   behold the deposition of the enormous vegetation which, in the
   carboniferous era, must have overspread the earth--vegetation in
   comparison with which, it has been said, the existing jungle of the
   tropics is mere barrenness.

   In the secondary period we have, as in the Palæozoic, three great
   systems, the New red sandstone, the Oolitic, and the Chalk--the Oolitic
   being especially remarkable as the era of those gigantic reptiles,
   whose strange and fearful forms at once amaze the ignorant and interest
   the curious.

   With the tertiary period--with whose subdivisions, as laid down by
   Lyell, and generally accepted by geologists, we need not here concern
   ourselves--we approach our own era. We meet with animals of dimensions,
   indeed, far exceeding any with which we are now familiar, but in
   structure allied to existing species. We are carried forwards to an
   arrangement of physical conditions not differing widely from the
   present.

   Such is a brief statement of the successive materials, so to speak,
   which compose the structure of the earth. Imperfect as it is, it is
   sufficiently complete for our purpose. In the mere facts thus
   disclosed, there seems already evidence of the order for which we seek.
   The actual structure of the earth, however, is something very different
   from that now suggested. It is not built up in the manner we have
   described, with the successive systems regularly laid upon one another,
   as they were progressively formed--the earliest everywhere lowest, and
   the latest highest. If such had been its actual construction, that
   construction would probably have for ever remained a secret to us. We
   could not have penetrated to its deep and hidden foundations. As it is,
   however, we are enabled to explore the whole structure, and find order
   and beauty in it, through means which might have seemed only destined
   to insure its destruction. Its foundations have been laid bare to us;
   while its later architecture lies equally exposed, not in mere
   disrupted fragments, but in vast and orderly terraces. The fact is,
   that in the process of the earth's formation, during the long periods
   which had been employed in the gradual deposition of the various strata
   in the order of time we have described, those igneous agencies
   concerned in the production of the earliest rocks continued at work,
   breaking up and dislocating the incumbent strata, and forcing the
   granite upwards in all directions. To the same causes the different
   species of trap-rocks, piercing upwards in great veins, owe their
   elevation causes which we still see in some degree active in our
   volcanoes. Whatever theory may be held as to the special intensity of
   these causes in the past periods of the earth's history--whether we
   adopt a catastrophic or a uniformitarian hypothesis--the result is the
   same. The granite, which is everywhere the base of the earth's crust,
   has yet been elevated far above all the posterior strata. It is no
   longer merely the impenetrable foundation or central abutment of the
   rocky systems; but it stretches upwards in vast branches, forming, so
   to speak, a skeleton framework for the earth. Somewhat as the bony
   skeleton in the living body everywhere ramifies it, giving strength and
   consistency to all its parts, so the granitic framework pierces on all
   sides throughout the earth's crust, compacting and consolidating it
   into its present state. And even somewhat as the muscular tissues and
   folds of flesh overlie the bony skeleton, and find in it their ultimate
   points of support, so do the various rocky tissues, the successive
   folds of softer material, rest against the mountain masses. We must
   surely in all this trace evidence of special arrangement. "It is not,"
   as Dr Chalmers has said, "from some matter being harder than others
   that we infer design; but when we see the harder placed just where it
   is most needed, the inference seems irresistible." And in the present
   case it is surely impossible to contemplate the peculiar disposition of
   the granite in our earth, without recognising that so it must have been
   placed. The very terms which we are compelled to use in speaking of it,
   after the least theological fashion, imply so much. That so it is by
   any mere accident, is altogether inconceivable. The enormous agencies
   concerned in the elevation of the granite--could we have seen them
   operating--might have seemed merely blind and lawless; but the result
   is order, and we cannot help concluding that some presiding mind has
   been at work. The granite has been upheaved, it may be, by convulsive
   agencies of a magnitude and intensity far beyond any of which we have
   now experience; the superimposed strata have been rent, and tossed
   hither and thither. The vast process by which this was accomplished
   might have seemed mere wild confusion. But pierce and bore the earth in
   all directions, there is really nothing like confusion. The term is
   indeed unknown to science, and to no science more than to geology,
   immense and catastrophic, according to the most common opinion, as are
   the changes with which it has to do. Let the granite, for example, rise
   to whatever heights--let it tower in whatever alpine magnitudes--we
   never find that its proper, or what we might call its constitutional
   position, is altered: the foundations are still granite, if the
   granitic mass yet stretch in cleaving branches through the sedimentary
   strata, and far overreach their roof.

   And even so of all the different strata over the diversified surface of
   the earth; they all of them lie, as we have mentioned, severally
   exposed,--characterising, in their distribution, different countries
   and localities. The old red sandstone and carboniferous systems of the
   palæozoic era, for instance, form the immediate platform of large
   tracts of our island. The oolitic system of the reptilean era marks its
   eastern seaboard, while the chalk extends on the south and south-east.
   The whole economy of the terrene architecture is thus laid bare. It is
   spread out for our inspection; but, while all the various depositions
   thus appear on the surface, there is no confusion in their relative
   positions. They are never found at random--one set of strata being now
   below and then above another set--but always occupying the same
   relation to one another. If we find, for example, the lower silurian
   formation exposed in Wales, it is everywhere found to rest directly on
   the granite; if we find the old red sandstone in Devonshire, it again
   rests on the silurian, and the carboniferous system again on it. We
   never find the silurian imposed on the old red sandstone, nor the chalk
   below the oolitic. A set structure is surely here in the clearest
   manner discernible. We cannot well conceive any higher idea of
   structure than just such a special distribution of parts,--the parts of
   the same character being always found in the same place, in relation to
   the others.

   The order, indeed, which the mass of our earth discovers, is on a vast
   and comprehensive scale, which may not very readily fall in with our
   preconceptions or fancies. Man's feebleness is apt everywhere not
   merely to limit, but to spoil his judgments, so that order is perhaps
   more easily seen by him in mere neatness and formality, than in the
   bursting and glorious fulness of Nature's own form. Could the crust of
   our earth, for example, have preserved that appearance of uniform
   regularity which would have followed from the continuance of the
   sedimentary strata in the successive positions of the order of their
   formation--had it been a granite nucleus surrounded, in the words of Dr
   Buckland, "by entire concentric coverings of stratified rocks like the
   coats of an onion," and could we have been cognisant of this
   regularity, it might, we dare say, have impressed many more than the
   actual structural appearance which it presents. The order in the one
   case might have seemed more direct and apparent than in the other. But
   as it is, it is undoubtedly a far more glorious order--the product of a
   boundlessly comprehensive Plasticity, moulding the most mighty and
   apparently lawless agencies to the most magnificent, yet most exquisite
   results, and the more perfect just as it may transcend our feebleness
   and awaken our wonder.

   Apart from the disruptive movements of which our earth has been the
   scene, it would not have presented any of its characteristic and
   beautiful variety of hill and valley, of glen and stream. Its surface
   would have been a mere uniform level, without life or picturesqueness;
   its rivers mere sluggish canals; its whole aspect destitute of that
   interchangeable sweetness and grandeur, softer loveliness and rugged
   magnificence, which now makes it so glorious a mirror of Power and
   Wisdom and Goodness. To the same causes obviously does it also owe its
   peculiar fitness as the abode of human life. Tor otherwise the metals,
   without some knowledge of which man has never been able to rise above
   barbarism, would have been for ever concealed in their native crypts.
   Coal would have been sunk at an impenetrable depth, which no eye could
   have seen, and no skill have reached. And where, again, would have been
   our oceans, with no vast hollows to repose in? But it is needless, and
   even absurd, to make such suppositions. We have only done so for a
   moment, in order to make it clear how the mighty agencies which have
   been concerned in the present structure of the globe, wild and
   convulsive as they may have been, have been directed by the most
   far-reaching foresight to purposes of human improvement and happiness.
   They were only the tools in the Divine hand for the construction of
   man's abode. Far from being, in any sense, interferences with the
   terrene architecture, they were the very means by which it has been
   built up into the special order, at once most beautiful and most
   appropriate for him.

   In contemplating the great movements which geology reveals, it is
   important to observe further how completely dependent they appear. In
   those disruptive agencies, as well as in the various atmospheric,
   aqueous, and organic influences, under the operation of which the earth
   has assumed its present structure, it seems impossible that any one
   could for a moment find the ultimate explanation of the phenomena
   presented. If there are minds content to linger among the ultimate
   harmonies of astronomy, which stand forth so palpably to the
   intellectual view, we cannot yet imagine any abiding by the final
   agencies of geology, as if they carried with them any self-sustaining
   or efficient energy. They appear in the highest degree to be simply
   instrumental,--the merely blind agencies of a creative and designing
   Mind.

§ II.--CHAPTER III.

  COSMICAL AND TERRESTRIAL MAGNITUDES DIVINE POWER.

   IN the two previous chapters we have dwelt mainly on the celestial and
   terrestrial structures, as evincing an intelligent First Cause. It is
   order, as such, we have been contemplating. We have glanced but
   slightly at the peculiar evidence which the phenomena both of astronomy
   and geology furnish of immense power concerned in their creation and
   maintenance. So striking and impressive, however, is this evidence,
   that it seems right to. devote a brief chapter to its statement. The
   phenomena in question bring before us, more signally than any other, an
   all-powerful as well as wise Being.

   It is of course obvious, according to our whole plan of treatment, that
   we do not present this illustrative evidence as a logical proof of the
   Divine omnipotence. We do not profess to find the infinite in the mere
   bewildering magnitude and duration of the finite. This was indicated
   already in our introductory remarks. Yet it deserves to be noticed,
   that the only conceivable way in which the infinite could be exhibited
   and impressively set forth to finite beings, is by such an array of
   phenomena as the sciences of astronomy and geology unfold to
   us--namely, by an accumulated display of vast magnitudes and apparently
   interminable durations. If we do not amid such views logically reach
   the infinite, we are yet carried onwards to it, on the wings of an
   imagination which in vain essays to grasp the immensity of the fields
   of contemplation open to it.

   The simple extent of the celestial space, briefly exhibited in our
   first chapter, is well calculated to fill our minds with vast ideas of
   Divine power. Looking out from beyond our earth, the sphere of
   observation extends immeasurably on all sides. Inexhaustible to the
   naked eye, it is equally inexhaustible when, by the aid of the
   telescope, we are carried into regions so inconceivably remote that the
   mind sinks utterly overwhelmed by the spectacle. Neptune circles round
   the sun at a distance of nearly three thousand millions of miles; the
   nearest fixed star (a Centauri) is seven hundred times farther removed;
   while the bright Dog-star, according to the parallax given to it by
   Professor Henderson, is almost four times farther off than a Centauri,
   or about eighty billions of miles! These distances, however,
   inconceivable as they are, are nothing to those of the nebulous
   clusters which people the more inaccessible tracts of space, whose
   light, it is stated, can only reach us in thousands and even millions
   of years. [56] There is, in short, no limit to creation. In the expanse
   of cosmical phenomena we have assuredly, therefore, the only visible
   type of the infinite that it was possible for us to possess.

   If from the mere boundless expanse of the cosmical regions we turn to
   contemplate some of the special magnitudes and velocities with which
   they make us familiar, the attribute of power will perhaps display
   itself even more strikingly. Let the mass of our earth, possessing a
   diameter of about eight thousand miles, and of which we may be supposed
   to have some not indistinct conception, be taken as our starting-point.
   Enormous as it is, it dwindles into a mere point among the stellar
   magnitudes, and becomes even small beside its planetary companions.
   Jupiter is fourteen hundred times larger, and Saturn nearly the same
   size, encircled by a gorgeous envelope or ring which, it has been said,
   would enclose five hundred worlds as large as ours. [57] The mass of
   the sun itself is three hundred and fifty-four thousand nine hundred
   and thirty-six times that of the earth. It would not only fill up the
   orbit of the moon, but would extend nearly as far again. But this is as
   nothing compared with the mass of some of the stars. Who can conjecture
   the magnitude of a body which would fill the vast orbit of the earth?
   But the bright star in Lyra has a diameter which, it has been said,
   would fill even that orbit." [58] And among the nebulous stars some are
   supposed to be of even greater dimensions.

   Let us think, then, of the force concerned in the movements of such
   enormous masses. A cannon-ball projected from the mouth of a gun moves
   at the rate of about a thousand miles an hour, which is the rate of the
   diurnal motion of the earth at the equator; but the velocity of the
   earth's motion round the sun is sixty-five times faster than this.
   "Jupiter, equal in weight to fourteen hundred earths, moves with a
   velocity of 29,000 miles an hour. The rate of Mercury is 107,000 miles
   an hour. The velocity of the comet of 1680 is estimated at 880,000
   miles an hour." [59] The annual motion of one of the (fixed!) stars, 61
   Cygni, has been computed at one hundred and twenty millions of millions
   of miles. How mighty and transcending is the power displayed in these
   celestial masses and movements! It is certainly quite impossible that
   the conception of an all-powerful Being could have been more
   impressively set forth to the human mind. For whatever limit is at
   length reached in such contemplations does not arise from the
   exhaustion of evidence, but from the feebleness of our mental capacity
   to grasp the phenomena presented to it.

   The vast periods of geology, and the immense forces that must have
   operated in the formation of the earth, are eminently calculated to
   give us the same impression of an eternal and omnipotent Being. The
   data with which the science of geology furnishes us, are not, indeed,
   so indisputable as those furnished by astronomy. For while there are
   some who estimate the geological cycles by millions of years, there are
   others who strive to bring them within much narrower bounds; while
   there are some who recognise the agency of elemental forces in the past
   career of the earth, of a magnitude of which we have now no experience,
   there are others who contend for a uniformity of those agencies with
   those presently existing. The character of the agencies employed, it is
   clear, must be estimated according to the different reckoning of the
   periods allotted to the work. On any special geological hypothesis,
   however, the data are sufficiently significant for our purpose.
   According to any admissible estimate, we find ourselves, in tracing
   back the progress of the earth's formation, contemplating not a
   succession of days and years, but of ages and cycles of ages. The
   epochs that must have elapsed since the first great stones of the
   terrene structure were laid, and while terrace after terrace was added
   to it, carry us back into the night of time, far beyond the most
   fabulous computations of History. We ascend into the past by steps that
   weary our imagination to keep in view.

   Again, the power concerned in the production of the vast effects which
   we see around us would seem to be equally indubitable, whether we
   assume them to have been brought about by suddenly violent or by
   gradual action. On any tenable supposition as to the mode of the
   elevation of the Alps and the Andes to their present heights, we must
   surely recognise in such phenomena the agency of a Power, before which
   we can only bow in dumb and lowly reverence. Here, surely, we behold
   the doing of the Almighty of Him before whom "the nations are as a drop
   of the bucket," and who "taketh up the isles as a very little thing."

§ II.--CHAPTER IV.

  ELEMENTARY COMBINATIONS CRYSTALLISATION.

   BENEATH the architectural structure of the earth, there is an interior
   elementary structure of great interest and significance. The stones of
   the building are not merely disposed in an orderly and fitting manner,
   but in the composition of the stones themselves there is found an order
   of the most exquisite kind. The separate masses of matter are not only
   arranged; but matter itself, with which we have been hitherto only
   dealing in masses, presents a constitution of the most exact and
   definite character, highly illustrative of the Divine wisdom. As
   geology makes us familiar with the mechanical, or, as we have termed
   it, architectural structure of the earth, chemistry unfolds its
   elementary constitution.

   Chemists reckon at present upwards of sixty elementary substances.
   This; however, is a merely provisional reckoning, liable any day to
   alteration. A hitherto hidden bond of identity may yet be discovered
   between many substances which now obstinately resist identification. It
   is found, in fact, that only a comparatively small number of these
   substances enter, to any large and pervading extent, into the
   constitution of nature--viz., oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon, and,
   among the metals, silicium and aluminium. Oxygen is considered by far
   the most abundant substance in the earth. United with hydrogen, it
   constitutes water; with nitrogen, and a comparatively small proportion
   of carbon, it makes common air; while it enters, at the same time,
   largely into every kind of rock in the crust of the earth. Carbon,
   again, is the main constituent of all vegetable and animal matters; and
   silicium, in nearly equal combinations with oxygen (making silica), is
   said to form the basis of about half of the rocks of the earth.

   There appears to us to be something profoundly impressive in the
   contemplation of the few simple substances to which we can thus trace
   back all the multiform diversity of nature. How marvellous to reflect
   that the solid earth, the compact rocks, the limpid stream, and the
   clear atmosphere, the fields clothed with grass, and the valleys
   covered over with com, are only the varied combinations of a few
   elementary ingredients! So plastic is Nature! Science strips off the
   glorious forms in which she is everywhere robed, and brings us into her
   secret laboratories. But surely this does not diminish, but only
   heightens, the impression of wonderful intelligence which she
   everywhere reveals. So exquisite did nature's forms seem to the Grecian
   mind, that a Divine Presence seemed to speak from all of them. Beside
   the beautiful there everywhere arose the spiritual. The Oread, the
   Dryad, and the Nereid, were the graceful embodiments of the plastic
   Life, that seemed thus to animate the mountain, the forest, and the
   ocean; and, surely, intelligence is not less but more visible, that
   science shows us the few ingredients which, in different combinations,
   induce these diverse phenomena of nature. Although the mystery has been
   so far unveiled, and we can look far beyond the simple-hearted view of
   Paganism, yet we cannot get rid of the truth to which it dimly
   testified. We find ourselves among the last analyses of nature's
   processes, more impressively than ever in the presence of a living and
   presiding Intelligence.

   This is in the highest degree evident, when we contemplate the special
   character of those elementary combinations with which chemistry makes
   us acquainted: for it is ascertained, not merely that all the great
   features and products of nature are compounded of a comparatively few
   elementary ingredients, but that these ingredients everywhere combine
   only in certain definite and unvarying proportions. They obey laws of
   the greatest simplicity and exactness, "which never change, and which
   govern the formation of compounds of all classes and descriptions."
   [60] Thus "water, however produced, always consists of oxygen and
   hydrogen, in the proportion of 8 parts of the former to 1 of the latter
   by weight. Chalk, whether formed by nature or by the chemist, yields
   43.71 parts of carbonic acid, and 56.29 parts of lime. The rust which
   forms upon the surface of iron by the action of the atmosphere, is as
   invariable in its composition as if it had been formed by the most
   delicate adjustment of weight, by the most accurate manipulator, being
   28 parts of iron, and 12 parts of oxygen. This law is the basis of all
   chemical inquiry.'' [61]

   Where, again, the same elements unite, as they often do, to form
   different bodies, such combinations are always related as multiples.
   Thus, in the different compounds of nitrogen with oxygen, we find that
   with the same proportion of the former the latter unites only in the
   successive ratios of 8, 16, 24, 32, and 40. "There are no intermediate
   compounds whatever. And this law is perfectly general; whenever bodies
   combine in more than one proportion, a relation of this kind between
   the quantities concerned can be observed. It applies alike to
   elementary substances, and to compounds formed by the union of bodies
   themselves compound." [62] There may be an interruption in the series
   of numbers, or the relation of the numbers may not be quite so simple
   as in the case mentioned, but an exact numerical relation is found to
   underlie all compounds. So, in the gaseous state, bodies only unite
   according to exact measures or volumes, depending upon the wonderful
   connection between the specific weight of a gas or vapour and its
   volume. The volumes are always equal, or multiples the one of the
   other, and any extra quantity that may be present is sure to be left
   over when combination ensues.

   It is impossible to conceive anything more grand and simple than the
   mode in which the infinitely varied processes of nature are thus
   carried on. By merely multiplying the proportion of one of the
   ingredients, the most diverse substances are produced from the same
   elements. Thus, in the case mentioned by us, and so often instanced for
   its impressive simplicity--the combinations of oxygen with
   nitrogen--the several compounds are well known to possess the most
   different qualities--a definite increment of one of the ingredients
   making all the difference between a virulently noxious poison and the
   breath of man's life. What an unerring providence and skill does this
   evince in the continual assortment of nature's elementary products!
   What power, save an almighty one, could, from the mere varying
   composition of the same few elements, produce all this wonderful
   diversity of result? What intelligence, save an infinite one, could
   order and preserve with such a nice adjustment the infinitely
   multiplied combinations so as not to interfere with animal life and
   happiness? What striking and beautiful alliances, moreover, thus
   pervade nature! Things apparently the most opposite are yet radically
   akin. The pleasant nutriment and the noxious poison are of the same
   parentage; the rude lump of charcoal and the glittering diamond are the
   same substance. Matter is truly kindred in all its forms; nature a vast
   brotherhood, confessing to the same Maker and the same Preserver.

   But what perhaps especially claims our notice is, the numerical
   exactitude thus found to lie at the root of nature. In breaking up its
   rounded and beautiful forms, they are found to rest on the most
   strictly arithmetical basis. It is seen to be the most literal
   scientific truth that the "mountains are weighed in scales and the
   hills in a balance." As in the mighty movements of the heavens we are
   dealing with the most rigorous measurements; so, in the minute and
   hidden movements of matter, the great discovery of Dalton shows us to
   be equally dealing with such measurements. Whether or not we are
   justified in concluding all that the atomic theory demands, the law of
   definite and multiple proportions which it serves to express remains
   indubitable; and in contemplating the constitution of matter, this
   leaves us, in the last resort, face to face with numerical order.

   Whence, then, this order? Science has disclosed its character; what has
   it to say as to its explanation? It has expressed, under the name of
   chemical affinity, all that it has to say on this subject. Elementary
   combinations take place under the influence of an elective force, so
   described with reference to the special dispositions to union
   manifested by all ultimate particles. It is under the operation of this
   so-called force that the constant interchange and balance of nature's
   ingredients are alone preserved, and that its existing forms are
   maintained with such nice and unvarying discrimination. As we have, in
   the wide region of space, gravitation uniting all bodies, and drawing
   them to common centres, so we have the attraction of cohesion holding
   the masses of the different bodies together; and finally, chemical or
   elective attraction, serving by its occult power to give determinate
   character or form to every kind of material creation. [63] But, after
   all, science merely conceals its ignorance by such general expressions.
   The laws in question are simply the last reductions of its persevering
   research; and so far from their furnishing any adequate explanation of
   the phenomena, they imperatively claim themselves to be explained. It
   is only, according to our whole argument, when we recognise in these
   general laws the operative modes of a Supreme Intelligence, that we
   reach a satisfactory meaning in nature, or an adequate explanation of
   its order.

   There is a further order of inorganic matter peculiarly mathematical in
   its character, and well deserving our attention before proceeding to
   higher illustrations of our subject--that, namely, which is expressed
   in the beautiful and well-known phenomena of crystallisation. If, among
   the last results of chemistry, we find ourselves in the region of
   numbers, we here become conversant with the exact forms of geometry.
   Stones and minerals we are familiarly apt to regard as not possessing
   any definite shape and structure--an idea which lies with somewhat
   vitiating force at the bottom of Paley's famous comparison of the stone
   found upon the heath, and the watch. In fact, however, there are few
   things so exactly defined as simple minerals; and this not only in
   their external figure, but peculiarly in their interior and most hidden
   structure. Crystallisation, which is the ordinary state in which a
   great number of the substances of the earth are found, is nothing else
   than a regular geometrical form, accompanied by and dependent upon a
   regular structure. It has been well described to be a "peculiar and
   most admirable work of nature's geometry;" and so minutely and
   elaborately has nature wrought her geometrical patterns, that they are
   found to reappear after the most minute subdivision. Beneath the fixed
   variety of external or secondary forms which crystalline bodies assume,
   there is an ultimate or primitive form retained by the smallest
   particles of each crystal. Thus, to employ the illustration of Dr
   Buckland, "we have more than five hundred branches of secondary forms
   presented by the crystals of the well-known substance of carbonate of
   lime. In each of these we trace a five-fold series of subordinate
   relations of one system of combinations to another system, under which
   every individual crystal has been adjusted by laws acting correlatively
   to produce harmonious results." Again, he adds, "Every crystal of
   carbonate of lime is made up of millions of particles of the same
   compound substances having one invariable primary form--viz., that of a
   rhomboidal solid, which may be obtained to an indefinite extent by
   mechanical division." [64] Some, as Professor Moh, reckon four, and
   others six, of these primitive crystalline forms.

   It is needless for us to dwell upon the abundant theistic meaning which
   such phenomena present. The only conception which we can have of
   crystallisation, the definition by which alone we can express it,
   indicates, in the clearest manner, the working of intelligence. The
   geometric stamp is impressed on the minutest particle. The die is
   inwrought beyond the furthest process of cleavage or mere mechanical
   division. Shiver the crystalline mass as we may, the figure still
   lives. Where form is so deeply and curiously impressed, we must surely
   recognise a Former. Nature's "admirable geometry" irresistibly points
   to nature's great Geometer.

§ II.--CHAPTER V.

  ORGANISATION DESIGN.

   WE have been hitherto tarrying amid the comparatively simple and
   general phenomena of inorganic matter. By degrees we have advanced from
   the most simple and comprehensive to the more special and definite laws
   which mark the inorganic world. We have contemplated the vast and
   beautiful cosmical order subserved by the law of gravitation, and the
   general laws of motion; the structure of the earth in its apparently
   irregular, yet most orderly flights of architecture--the constitution
   of matter, revealing relations so exact, and a higher and more refined
   law of kindred or elective attraction. We have further observed the
   regular geometrical forms exhibited in crystallisation--no longer
   merely chemical compositions, but symmetrical arrangement. Our
   illustrations have been thus of a progressive character. Material order
   has been contemplated in an ascending series of complexity, from the
   ruder form of mere mechanical adjustment, to the higher forms of
   chemical affinity and geometric adaptations.

   Crystallisation is the most perfect form assumed by inorganic matter.
   It is the highest order we reach among inorganic phenomena. There are,
   however, far higher, or at least more complex and impressive, modes of
   order presented to us in the material world, and bearing, therefore, as
   they have been always supposed to bear, with a special force upon the
   illustration of our subject.

   Clearly marked as is the highest kind of inorganic order which we have
   considered, it is yet, so to speak, a mere outward order, proceeding
   from external junction of parts. It is the result of force from
   without, and dependent upon the direction and degree of the compulsory
   application. On the first view of organic phenomena, we are struck with
   their essential difference in this respect. We contemplate no longer
   merely a combination of outward relations, but a product of inward
   forces. The material object is no longer merely, as even in the case of
   the crystal, the result of aggregation, of the external juxtaposition
   of particles; it is a living production forming itself from within. A
   new power is seen stirring in matter--a power not only of selection or
   of adaptation, but of assimilation, and, moreover, of reproduction.
   Inorganic matter, it has been well said, only finds, organic makes,
   what is added to its structure; recasting the inert substance, and
   exhibiting it in new unions, not of binary merely, but of ternary and
   quaternary combinations. The inorganic changes that oh which it acts
   chemically; the organic vitalises, and imparts to the matter which it
   vitalises the power of acting in the same way on other substances.
   "This is the end and object of that series of functions which,
   beginning with absorption, conveys the absorbed matter through the stem
   into the leaves, then subjects it to a process of exhalation, submits
   the rest to the action of the atmosphere, conveys it back into the
   system, elaborates it by secretion, and ends in assimilation. The plant
   is also generative. The inorganic mass can only increase by cohesion,
   by agglomeration from without. But the plant 'hath its seed in itself.'
   It exists in generations. Besides vitalising that which is necessary to
   the conservation of each of its own parts, it is endowed with the power
   of giving existence to a new whole, and of providing the germ with the
   nourishment necessary for it, in order to commence its independent
   being." [65]

   These two attributes of assimilation and reproduction mark off and
   determine organic matter, in its lowest forms, from inorganic. They are
   the distinctive attributes of life in its feeblest developments. Our
   knowledge of life begins with them; and beyond such manifestations of
   the vital element--unsearchable in its hidden depths--our knowledge
   will probably never reach. Whenever matter is found to possess these
   properties, in contradistinction to the mere properties of chemical
   attraction or crystallisation, it is said to be organised. If we
   inquire more particularly for a definition of organisation, that given
   by Kant seems to be acknowledged to be the best. "An organised product
   of nature," he says, "is that in which all the parts are mutually means
   and ends." It is not only, it will be observed, the idea of dependence
   among the parts which is here expressed; this would not form an advance
   beyond the formerly considered phenomena of matter. There is a
   beautifully coherent dependence between the several particles of a
   crystal. But the definition of Kant expresses further an adjustment or
   dependence between all the different parts of an organised body, so as
   to subserve the definite purpose of maintaining the whole body; and not
   only so, but the further idea that the maintenance of the whole is
   essential to the maintenance of any of the parts. It expresses, in
   short, the fact of a constantly subsisting relation between all the
   parts on which the subsistence of the whole depends. Such an
   interacting relation does not exist between the several parts of an
   inorganised body. We can, on the contrary, break up a crystal, as we
   have seen, even indefinitely, without destroying its primitive
   constitutive form. But let us take to pieces a plant, and, destroying
   the living relation between the parts, we destroy the organism.
   Organisation, in its simplest appearance, presents, therefore, a more
   complex and delicate--so to speak--a more subtle and essential species
   of order than any which we have hitherto contemplated.

   In this mere fact of organisation furnishing us with a farther and more
   refined example of order, we have an additional illustrative evidence
   of Divine intelligence. We recognise, with impressive force, the
   artist, in the higher specimen of art before us. To the query, Whence?
   which immediately arises here, as in the contemplation of all order, we
   are carried, in answer, irresistibly back to a supremely intelligent
   Will.

   But is this all the theistic inference impressed upon us in the
   contemplation of organic phenomena? Is not design in some sense
   peculiarly present in such phenomena? Physiology has been commonly
   supposed to be the special sphere of the doctrine of final causes, and
   its study held to possess a special interest and value in this respect.
   It will be well to set clearly before the reader the distinctive
   relation of this branch of the illustrative evidence to that presented
   by the simple phenomena of inorganic matter, especially as this
   relation has not always been apprehended in a just and discriminating
   light.

   First of all, then, it seems undoubted that the phenomena of
   organisation do possess a certain peculiar impressiveness in regard to
   the theistic argument. Merely as examples of a higher and more
   curiously related order, they are, to many minds at least, peculiarly
   suggestive of creative intelligence. The elaborate texture and
   delicately-wrought colouring of vegetable forms, or again, the manifold
   and complex felicities of animal structures, may be conceived more
   vividly pregnant with the idea of design, of wisdom concerned in the
   result, than even the most perfect and mathematically regular
   combinations of inorganic matter. In this view Paley's often-impugned
   comparison--the boldly-struck key-note of his delightful work--may be
   so far justified. Taking the stone gathered from the heath on the one
   hand, and the watch on the other, there can be no doubt that the
   absolute contrast which he institutes between them is not to be
   defended. The stone is by no means destitute of those marks of
   workmanship which we recognise so immediately in the watch; and to the
   inquiry, "how the stone came to be there?" these marks or characters,
   on examination, furnish an answer no less decided than the special
   adjustment of the several parts of a watch does as to its origin.
   Supposing the stone were a crystal, we have seen how skilfully
   configured is such an inorganic product; supposing it only a rude mass
   of sandstone, without symmetry of form or beauty of lustre, it yet
   appears, in the light of Dalton's great discovery, to be an
   exquisitely-arranged compound; and its special composition, whatever
   that might be, would be full of reply as to its origin. Paley's
   comparison, therefore, fails when pushed to the extent which he has
   implied; but, when used as merely serving to bring before the popular
   mind a more impressive exhibition of design, it is sufficiently valid.
   A watch, with its complicated mechanism of wheels and pulleys and
   springs, causing a definite motion in a definite time, is apparently
   the result of greater skill than any mineral composition, however
   exact. So at least it would doubtless seem to most minds. In the same
   way, any flower or animal structure of peculiar delicacy and utility
   may be thought to speak of God more plainly than even the most
   beautiful and elaborate crystalline structure.

   But farther than this--beyond such a higher utility in the way of
   popular illustration--we cannot admit that organic phenomena by
   themselves exhibit any peculiar theistic meaning. They express the
   inference of design more conspicuously, but this is all. This, we
   imagine, is incapable of being disputed, on reflection. At the same
   time, it appears to us that considerable confusion and inconsequence of
   thought prevail upon this subject even among some of our highest
   scientific thinkers. The relation of the doctrine of final causes, in
   its fundamental theological import,, to the special scientific
   application which has been made of it in physiology, is not apprehended
   with sufficient clearness; and a certain measure of doubt has been thus
   allowed to rest on the subject, which seems to us perverting, and even
   fatal, in reference to the general principle. Dr Whewell, for example,
   has observed: "It has appeared to some persons that the mere aspect of
   order and symmetry in the works of nature--the contemplation of
   comprehensive and consistent law--is sufficient to lead us to the
   conception of a design and intelligence producing the order and
   carrying into effect the law. Without here attempting to decide whether
   this is true, we may discern, after what has been said, that the
   conception of design arrived at in this manner is altogether different
   from that idea of design which is suggested to us by organised bodies,
   and which we describe as the doctrine of final causes. The regular form
   of a crystal, whatever beautiful symmetry it may exhibit, whatever
   general laws it may exemplify, does not prove design in the same manner
   in which design is proved by the provisions for the preservation and
   growth of the seeds of plants and of the young of animals. The law of
   universal gravitation, however wide and simple, does not impress us
   with the belief of a purpose, as does that propensity by which the two
   sexes of each animal are brought together." [66]

   There is, according to what we have already said, a certain measure of
   truth in this passage. The law of gravitation does not impress us with
   the belief of purpose and design in the same degree, perhaps, as does
   that "propensity by which the two sexes of each animal are brought
   together;" but surely there is nothing altogether different in the idea
   of design in the two cases. It may be, that in the one case the idea
   presents itself to our sensuous observation more vividly, and is
   therefore entitled to guide us in our scientific researches into
   physiological relations, in a way that would be apt rather to mislead
   than assist the astronomer in his researches among the heavenly bodies.
   Design, in short, may not be with the astronomer, as with the
   physiologist, an appropriate principle of discovery. The former does
   not take it with him directly as a guide. The lower principle of mere
   sequential induction sufficiently serves his purpose. Yet if the higher
   principle be a reality and not a fiction, it must meet the astronomer
   equally in the end. He must ascend to it. He cannot rest, according to
   our whole previous reasoning, in the mere relation of sequence with
   which he sets out. The physiologist, on the other hand, may be said to
   start with the principle of design in possession, as a clue of
   discovery; for the phenomena with which he deals are no longer merely
   sequential, but teleological. They express themselves not only as
   related, but as related after the special manner of means and ends. The
   principle of design has therefore, it may be granted, a special
   application to these phenomena. So at least it has been maintained by
   many of our highest physiologists, and with apparent justice. Whereas
   in the one case it is only the final answer to the inevitable inquiry,
   Whence? in the other it is present from the first, everywhere
   suggesting the inquiry, Why?

   Yet it must never be forgotten that design is only thus present in the
   latter case, because found in all cases, in relation to one class of
   phenomena as well as to another--inorganic as well as organic--to
   establish itself as the only final principle of explanation. It is only
   possibly present as a scientific guide, because admitted as a
   theological principle. It is only in the light of the ultimate rational
   necessity which finds Mind everywhere in nature, that design, or the
   operation of Mind, can be especially maintained in organic phenomena.
   This follows in the clearest manner from the whole basis of our
   previous reasoning, and is indubitable on the simple ground, that
   nature in no case of itself can gave us Mind, but only reflects it in
   the mirror of our consciousness. And assuredly there is no rational
   basis on which we can conclude Mind to be thus reflected in one set of
   natural phenomena and not in another. Now it is because the language of
   Dr Whewell leaves this, as it were, in doubt, that it appears to us
   objectionable. He puts aside the question as to whether the mere aspect
   of order and symmetry in nature is sufficient to lead us to the
   conception of design and intelligence; or, in other words, demands this
   conception in order to its explanation. He puts aside this question as
   one not necessarily affecting the special scientific doctrine of final
   causes; whereas, according to our whole view, it is one most vitally
   affecting this doctrine, and without a clear settlement of which, this
   doctrine cannot for a moment be consistently maintained.

   The only theistic difference, then, in the phenomena now before us,
   consists in the more vivid impression of Mind which they give us. In
   the very conception of a set of organs related to one another as means
   to ends, we have intelligence directly suggested. The contrivance
   bespeaks a contriver, yet only a contriver adequate to the special
   result in each case. While here, therefore, we may be said to be
   brought more immediately into the presence of Mind, it may yet be
   doubted whether we are brought so near to the first or supreme Mind as
   among the general laws of astronomy and chemistry. The comparative
   value of the respective phenomena for the theistic conclusion may in
   this way truly admit of question; and we can easily understand how some
   minds feel themselves more directly borne onward to this conclusion in
   the ultimate region of inorganic order, than while merely tarrying amid
   the crowded and endless intricacies of organic contrivance.

   The true view seems to be, that the study of the latter phenomena is
   more useful in educating and strengthening within us the ideas of
   Divine wisdom and goodness; the contemplation of the former, in
   carrying us backwards to a great First Cause. The element of
   intelligence, already lying at the root of the theistic conception, is
   set forth in clear and engaging brightness by the variedly curious and
   beautiful phenomena of organic nature; while, in the nature of the
   case, the evidence for the Divine goodness only emerges as we travel
   onwards to the facts of sentient organism. [67] The higher complicacy
   of physiological order stamps on our minds more impressively the fact
   of the Divine wisdom; while the subserviency of this order to ends of
   happiness in the animal creation, brings before us the beneficence of
   the Designer.

   Our illustrative evidence, while resting from the outset on the same
   logical basis, thus truly gathers force and comprehensiveness for our
   special conclusion as it proceeds. Setting out with the theistic
   conception in its most naked form, it clothes itself with the full
   attributes of that conception, as it expatiates over a wider and more
   diversified field of induction.

§ II.--CHAPTER VI.

  SPECIAL ORGANIC PHENOMENA VEGETABLE.

   IN entering on the wide and diversified field of organic contrivance,
   our sole difficulty is that of selection. So crowded is it with
   illustrations fitted to our subject, that volumes might easily be
   devoted to special sections of it; and in fact, there is no other
   department of our evidence that has received such ample and varied,
   and, we may add, such skilful treatment. The work of Paley alone has
   made all familiar with its interesting details; and, conceived as this
   work is throughout in so fine a vein of homely English sense; rich with
   the light of a meaning everywhere clear and impressive, if not highly
   consecutive or profound; written, moreover, with such inimitable grace
   and felicity of style, it seems as if it were at once presumptuous and
   useless for us to enter upon ground which he has traversed with such
   fascinating success. [68] We are only led to do so from a conviction of
   the too obvious gap and imperfection which would otherwise be left in
   the course of our illustrative evidence. The knowledge of what has been
   already so fully accomplished in this department, will at the same time
   lead us to dwell upon it as briefly as we can, consistently with the
   necessities of our plan.

   The two great characteristics of organic phenomena, in their lowest
   forms, we have, in the last chapter, pointed out to be assimilation and
   reproduction. The plant, down to its least developed specimen, exhibits
   these properties in contradistinction to any specimen of inorganic
   matter. Organisation analysed to its finest point--the minute cell,
   which it requires the highest powers of the microscope to detect--is
   marked by a forming power, quite distinct from anything in the
   inorganic creation. While the inorganic, at the highest point of
   development, is, as it has been said, a mere carrier of force, the
   organic is essentially a centre of force.

   It is deserving of notice how complete is the structure which the
   microscope reveals in the elementary cell. Beaching to the rudimentary
   source of organisation--the hidden workshop, may we call it?--of the
   beautiful forms of life that teem all around, we are here, as
   everywhere, in the presence of order. The forming hand appears in the
   most signal manner, although we cannot trace its action, save by the
   delicate scrutiny of the microscope.

   The general process of assimilation or nutrition in plants is of a
   highly interesting description. The various organs concerned in the
   process--the root, the stem, and the leaves--are all so many structures
   of the most exquisite delicacy and beauty, furnishing, in their study,
   a continued illustration of the Divine wisdom. We cannot now, however,
   dwell upon the simple construction of these organs. Their functions, in
   the discharge of the nutritive process, are for our object even more
   interesting; and to the consideration of these, therefore, we readily
   pass.

   The root at once gives stability to the plant in the soil, and, by the
   fibrils which it sends forth in all directions, collects materials for
   its food. For this latter purpose, the fibril roots, with the main root
   itself (caudex), are provided with soft porous terminations, called
   spongioles, from their peculiar efficacy in imbibing the surrounding
   moisture. When the moisture, holding different matters in solution, has
   been absorbed, it ascends through the stem--by modes which vary, and
   which are not yet in all respects thoroughly understood--to the leaves,
   where it is partly exhaled, and partly undergoes an important chemical
   change, rendering it fit for becoming assimilated. The leaves are the
   peculiar seat of what has been called vegetable digestion, though the
   entire process of this, and even the nature of the action of the
   leaves, are still involved in considerable obscurity. It is certain,
   however, that during the day, and pre-eminently during bright sunshine,
   they are ceaselessly inhaling from the atmosphere carbonic acid,
   decomposing it, appropriating and assimilating its carbon, and exhaling
   its oxygen. It is, indeed, believed that during darkness this process
   is inverted; that oxygen is absorbed, and combined with waste or
   superfluous carbon, and carbonic acid exhaled; but still we know with
   certainty, from its own continued increment, that the plant
   appropriates more carbon than it rejects; that it therefore removes
   from the atmosphere more carbonic acid than it throws out into it; and
   thus that the permanent influence of these changes upon the atmosphere
   is in the highest degree favourable, the assimilating functions
   operating much more powerfully to purify than the respiratory to
   vitiate it. Plants are thus, in contradistinction to animals, the great
   conservators of atmospheric purity.

   The sap, strengthened and enriched in the laboratory of the leaves, is
   sent back from them to the various parts of the plant for assimilation,
   for which it has now become exactly fitted. The same degree of
   uncertainty prevails regarding the precise character of the sap's
   descent as exists regarding its ascent. In dicotyledonous plants its
   main current is through the liber, or inner portion of the bark, but it
   also descends through the alburnum or most recently formed wood,
   through which, in the same plants, flows the main current of the
   ascending sap. In monocotyledonous plants its passage is through the
   innermost layer of the structure, which is also the most recently
   formed. [69] The sap in its descent deposits the materials of fresh
   growth in the plant, as well as of the different well-known
   products,--gum, sugar, oils, and resin, so useful in domestic economy
   and in the arts. At the root, whence the nutritive process started, it
   terminates with imparting hardness and tenacity to the fibrils, and
   bringing matter to form new spongioles, while the old are gradually
   covered with an impervious cuticle.

   It is impossible to contemplate this process without being impressed
   with its marvellous fitness and beauty. What a busy scene of orderly
   activity is thus every plant around us, from the noble forest-tree to
   the lowly lichen. And when we contemplate all the successive and
   intervolved adaptation conducing to the result, and again how the life,
   which is the result, alone gives impulse and continuance to the whole,
   we cannot, surely, doubt the Wisdom which directs and controls so
   finely adjusted a series of phenomena.

   The phenomena of vegetable reproduction are even more strikingly
   manifestive of creative design. Passing by the simpler facts displayed
   by the cryptogamous vegetation, we have in the reproductive organs of
   the higher classes of plants some very curious and complicated
   adaptations.

   These organs are all embraced in what is botanically called the flower.
   Its parts consist of four series or whorls, as they are technically
   termed--1, the calyx; 2, the corolla; 3, the stamen; 4, the pistil.
   These are all now regarded as merely transformations of leaves, altered
   so as to suit the particular functions which each performs. They
   sometimes appear in the form of true leaves, without any marked
   modification. The calyx is the outer covering of the flower--the
   symmetrical cup in which it commonly rests. It is usually of the same
   green colour as the leaves, but sometimes also, as in the fuchsia and
   Indian cress, it is differently coloured. Its several parts are termed
   sepals. The corolla is the flower, popularly so called; its parts,
   which are sometimes distinct and sometimes united in various ways, are
   termed petals. "The petals are composed of a congeries of minute cells,
   each containing colouring matter and delicate spirals interspersed, all
   being covered by a thin epidermal coat or skin. The coloured cells are
   distinct from one another, and thus a dark colour may be at one part
   and a light colour at another. How exquisitely are the colours of
   flowers diversified, and with what a masterly skill are their varied
   hues arranged! Whether blended or separated, as Thornton remarks, they
   are evidently under the control of a taste which never falls short of
   the perfection of elegance." [70]

   The two latter or inner organs, upon which the production of seed
   essentially depends, show a peculiarly minute and delicate structure.
   The pistil consists of a hollow tube called the style, terminating at
   one end in a kind of spongiole named the stigma; at the other, in the
   seed-vessel or ovary. The stamens, which commonly, as in the rose,
   enclose the pistil, consist of a stalk or filament supporting a rounded
   oblong body called the anther, the cells of which are filled with the
   fine fecundating powder termed pollen, which is sometimes little more
   than visible to common inspection, but presents, under the microscope,
   multiplied distinct forms.

   There is a singular and highly interesting numerical order found to
   characterise the relation of all these different organs of the plant to
   one another. "Thus, if a flower has 5 parts of the calyx, it has
   usually 5 of the corolla alternating with them, 5, 10, 20, &c.,
   stamens, and 5, or some multiple of 5, in the parts of the pistil." And
   equally so when the parts of the calyx are 3 the numerical bases of 3
   and 5 being the most generally prevailing in the vegetable kingdom,
   although the numbers 2 and 4, with their multiples, are also to be
   found. "It is worthy of notice," adds the author from whom we borrow
   these facts, "that flowers exhibiting 5 or 4, or multiples of these
   numbers, in their whorls, usually belong to plants having two
   seed-lobes or cotyledons, and which, when they form permanent woody
   stems, exhibit distinct zones or circles, and have separable bark;
   while flowers having 3, or a multiple of 3 in their whorls, present
   only one seed-lobe, and when they form permanent woody stems, exhibit
   no distinct zones nor circles, and have no separable bark. The numbers
   2 and 4, or multiples of them, are seen also in the parts of
   fructification of flowerless plants which have no seed-lobes, such as
   ferns, mosses, seaweeds, &c. The processes which project from the
   urn-like cases of mosses are arranged in the series 4, 8, 12, 16, 32,
   64, &c. The parts of fructification of scale-mosses (Jungermanniæ) are
   in fours, as also the germs of some sea-weeds. Thus the numbers 5 and 4
   and their multiples prevail among dicotyledonous and exogenous plants;
   the number 3 and its multiples occur among monocotyledonous or
   endogenous plants; while 2 and 4, and multiples of them, are met with
   among acotyledonous or acrogenous plants." [71]

   The theistic conclusion undoubtedly receives confirmation from these
   and all other evidences of exact numerical relations in nature. They
   express very clearly the Divine plan everywhere stamped on it.

   Let us now mark the reproductive process as subserved by these organs.
   Fecundation is the immediate result of communication between the
   stamens and pistil,--the former, which produce the pollen, being the
   active or male, the latter the receptive or female organs. In the great
   majority of cases the stamens and pistil are found on the same plant,
   the former overtopping the latter--an arrangement which gives the most
   simple mode of fecundation, by enabling the stigma readily to receive
   the falling pollen as it bursts from the anther. In order to secure
   this purpose more effectually, the stigma exudes a slightly glutinous
   fluid, to which the grains of the pollen adhere. These grains, whose
   manifold structure, as seen under the microscope, has been already
   noticed, have each two coats, one of which bursts when the grain is
   ripe, and the other, in touching the stigma, elongates itself into the
   shape of a slender tube, passing downwards through the style into the
   ovary, and so conveying to the germ the vivifying fluid. "The cells of
   the stigma are beautifully contrived to admit the passage of these
   tubes, as they are long, and extremely loose in texture, at the same
   time so moist and elastic as to be easily compressed when necessary. It
   is so contrived that the minute particles contained in the grains enter
   slowly to the ovary, as it seems necessary that the fecundating matter
   should be admitted by degrees. It is also necessary that the tube
   should enter the foramen of the ovule; and as the ovule is not always
   in a proper position to receive it, it will be found to erect itself or
   to turn, as the case may be, while the granules of the pollen grains
   are passing down the tubes." [72]

   In drooping flowers, such as the fuchsia--where it would be obviously
   no longer fitting that the stamens should exceed the pistil in length,
   as thereby the pollen would be scattered on the ground instead of
   reaching the stigma--the relation of the parts is found inverted in
   correspondence with the altered character of the plant. And, in fact,
   nothing can be more beautiful and impressive than the great variety of
   adaptations by which, in special cases, communication is secured
   between the pollen and the pistils. "In the common nettle the stamens
   have elastic filaments, which are at first bent down, so as to be
   obscured by the calyx; but when the pollen is ripe, the filaments jerk
   out, and thus scatter the powder on the pistils, which occupy separate
   flowers. In the common barberry, the lower part of the filament is very
   irritable; and whenever it is touched, the stamen moves forward to the
   pistil. In the style-wort (Stylidium) the stamens and pistil are united
   in a common column which projects from the flower; this column is very
   irritable at the angle where it leaves the flower, and when touched, it
   passes with a sudden jerk from one side to the other, and thus scatters
   the pollen. In the hazel, where the pollen is in one set of flowers and
   the pistil in another, the leaves might interfere with the application
   of the pollen, and therefore they are not produced until it has been
   scattered." [73] In Dioecious plants, such as the willow, where the
   flowers are not only unisexual, but the stamen-bearing are on one tree
   and the pistil-bearing on another, the process of communication is
   effected in some cases by the winds, but in other cases, after a more
   complicated and ingenious manner, by insects. The bee, while providing
   food for its young, is at the same time aiding in the dispersion of the
   pollen. The peculiar shape of some flowers--the Orchids
   especially--seems to form an attraction for certain insects which are
   helpful in the same office. One of the most remarkable examples of this
   insect-agency in the distribution of the pollen is furnished by the
   birthwort (Aristolochia). In this plant the "flower consists of a long
   tube in a chamber, at the bottom of which the stamens and pistil are
   placed, completely shut out from the agency of the winds. It is
   frequented, in its native country, by an insect which enters the tube
   easily, and gets into the little chamber. On attempting to get out, it
   is prevented by a series of hairs in the tube, which all point
   downwards. It therefore moves about in the little cavity, and thus
   distributes the pollen on the pistil, soon after which the flower
   withers and the insect escapes." [74]

   When impregnation is completed, the other parts of the flower decay,
   whilst the "gravid seed-vessel" increases in bulk, till it becomes,
   under very diversified forms, what is called the fruit. All these
   forms, many of which are so familiarly known and useful, would seem to
   have one prime object in view, viz. the preservation of the seed. The
   production of this seed has been the great end of the process hitherto
   described; and, this end accomplished, the flower dies, whilst the
   energies of the plant are turned to the nursing of the little embryo
   which it has left behind, and which is destined in its time to advance
   into new forms of floral beauty. "Nothing," adds Paley, [75] "can be
   more single than the design, more diversified than the means.
   Pellicles, shells, pulps, pods, husks, skin, scales armed with horns,
   are all employed in prosecuting the same intention."

   When the seeds reach maturity, their dispersion is provided for in
   various interesting ways. In some cases the fruit falls without
   opening, and gradually decays, forming a sort of manure with the soil
   in which the plant sprouts. In other cases the seed-vessels open and
   scatter the seeds. "In the common broom, the pod, when ripe, opens with
   considerable force; so also the fruit of the sandbox-tree, and the
   balsam, which is called Touch-me-not, on account of its seed-vessel
   bursting when touched. The squirting cucumber, when handled in its ripe
   state, gives way at the point where the fruit joins the stalk, and the
   seeds are sent out with amazing force. The common geranium seed-vessels
   curl up when ripe, and scatter the seeds. In the case of firs,
   bignonias, and some other plants, the seeds are furnished with winged
   appendages; while in the cotton-plant and asclepias they have hairs
   attached to them, by means of which they are wafted to a distance."
   "The plant called Rose of Jericho becomes dried up like a ball, and is
   tossed about by the wind until it comes into contact with water, when
   its small pods open, and the seeds are scattered; and a species of
   fig-marigold in Africa opens its seed-vessel when moisture is applied."
   "In the dandelion, the leaves which surround the clusters or heads of
   flowers are turned downwards, the receptacle becomes convex and dry,
   the hairs spread out so as to form a parachute-like appendage to each
   fruit, and collectively to present the appearance of a ball, and in
   this way the fruit is prepared for being dispersed by the winds." [76]

   The seed being deposited in the soil, the process of germination takes
   place under the influence of heat, air, and moisture. The embryo sends
   forth, in one direction, a number of fibrous threads, which fix the
   plant in the ground. The radicle, in short, becomes the root. The
   plumule on the other side elongates itself, rising into the air in the
   form of the stem, frequently accompanied by one or more cotyledons or
   seed-leaves, according to the nature of the plant.

   And thus the great processes of nutrition and reproduction again
   proceed in the same varied and beautiful round, proclaiming the Wisdom
   which guides and which guards the whole.

   We might add indefinitely to the force of these illustrations, by a
   consideration of the same processes as exemplified in the animal
   kingdom. In this field we might easily glean some examples of
   peculiarly elaborate and striking contrivance, [77] subservient to the
   production and preservation of those higher and more complex forms of
   life which here meet us. The numerous and intricate organs employed in
   digestion, in the circulation of the blood, in respiration, and the
   exquisite order and regularity with which they perform their functions,
   are especially marked with instructive meaning in reference to our
   subject. As, however, according to our whole plan, we do not and cannot
   aim at a mere accumulation of instances which do not add some
   significance to our evidence, we pass onwards to those higher
   illustrations presented by the muscular and nervous phenomena, which
   are considered to be the distinctive characteristics of the animal
   kingdom.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [68] The Natural Theology, and in fact the general works of Paley, have
   of late somewhat lost the distinction they once enjoyed. This is
   undoubtedly owing to their marked deficiency in philosophic depth and
   comprehension, which leaves the reader so often unsatisfied, while yet
   pleased with their admirable clearness and sense. With an exquisite
   tact and homely intellect unrivalled, Paley was certainly no
   philosopher; and it is needless now to urge his claims in this respect.
   What he saw, he saw with a precision, and could express with a force
   and lucidity unsurpassed by any writer; but, for the most part, he not
   only did not see far into the deeper bearings of his subject, but there
   does not seem to have been any desire in his mind to do so. It will
   not, however, be a good sign of British thought if the works of Paley
   ever come to be generally depreciated. Types as they are of that
   healthy sobriety, tolerant temper, and quiet unobtrusive piety, which
   have hitherto distinguished the highest products of British
   theology--characteristics which, in the present day, we may well pray
   God it may not lose--their study can never fail to be highly
   advantageous to the Christian student, and to reward him with an
   increase of strength and manliness.

   [69] It may be necessary to explain for some readers the general
   classification of plants into three great divisions--viz.,
   Dicotyledons, Monocotyledons, and Acotyledons, the name being derived
   from the structure of the seed in the first two cases, which, in the
   plants of the first division, is composed of two cotyledons, or lobes
   enclosing the germ, or proper seed; and in plants of the second
   division, is composed of only one such cotyledon. Plants of the third
   division, such as ferns, mosses, and lichens, have no seeds properly so
   called, and hence, as their name imparts, no cotyledons. They are
   propagated by minute granular bodies called sporules, which are really
   nothing else than distinct plants, disjoined from the parents, and
   increasing by the simple addition of cellular tissue. The first and
   second classes are also respectively called Exogenous and Endogenous,
   from the peculiar formation of the stem in each case--its increase in
   the first class proceeding from external additions, in the second from
   internal development. New matter in the one case is formed by
   successive layers on the outside, in the other by successive layers on
   the inside, or towards the centre.

§ II.--CHAPTER VII.

  SPECIAL ORGANIC PHENOMENA CONTINUED--ANIMAL.

   BlCHAT first clearly propounded the distinction between merely
   vegetable and animal life [78] which is now generally accepted. Besides
   the functions of nutrition and reproduction which the animal shares
   with the plant, the former is characterised by two special tissues, the
   muscular and the nervous, issuing in distinctive manifestations of
   vitality, higher than those to be found in the vegetable kingdom. It is
   doubtful, indeed, as formerly said, whether the separation thus marked
   out be clear and decided. We have certainly, among plants, at least the
   shadow of these higher vital developments which so prominently mark the
   animal creation, as in the phenomena of irritability in the Venus'
   flytrap, the sensitive plant, and some others. In the former plant the
   leaves are marked by three projecting hairs, which, when touched, have
   the singular property of causing the leaf to fold upon itself, shutting
   in the insect which may have caused the movement. The mode in which the
   leaves of the sensitive plant fold themselves together on the slightest
   touch is still more familiarly known. Remarkable as these movements
   are, however, the conclusion of botanical authorities, upon the whole,
   appears to be against the supposition of their being identical in
   source with similar movements in animals. "They are not dependent,"
   says the Professor of Botany in Edinburgh, "on nervous and muscular
   power, as is the case in animals, but they seem to be caused by the
   greater or less distension of cells connected with the base of the
   leaves and of the leaf-stalks." [79]

   The peculiar property of the muscular tissue is denominated
   contractility. It is simply the power possessed by the muscles of
   contracting or shortening themselves. This contractile power is
   observable in the lowest classes of animals, although they do not
   present any distinct trace of a fibrous structure. In the inferior
   zoophytes--such as the Infusoria, Polypi, Medusæ--the whole body seems
   to exhibit an incessant action upon the surrounding fluid, maintained
   by means of "very minute and generally microscopic filaments" called
   cilia, and which apparently serve in the case of these genera not only
   the purpose of progressive motion, but also of respiration, and of
   procuring a supply of food. [80] In the Radiata generally, however, no
   distinct muscles can be said to be traced, and their powers of movement
   are for the most part very limited.

   As we ascend the scale of animal life we begin to observe the formation
   of fibres, at first irregularly dispersed through the soft body, and
   then, as the organisation becomes more complex, collected into bundles,
   composing what are properly called muscles. [81] In many of the
   Articulata the muscular system is highly developed. Lyonet is said to
   have counted in some species of caterpillar not fewer than four
   thousand muscular bands; and the extraordinary weights which ants and
   beetles easily move, prove the muscular energy to be very powerful in
   these creatures. It is in the Vertebrata, however, and especially as
   displayed in the human body, that the muscular system has been most
   carefully studied, and is most familiarly known. And from this
   comparatively limited, but very adequate sphere, our illustrations will
   for the most part be drawn.

   The bundle-form is one of the most remarkable characteristics of the
   muscular tissue. The compact bundle is found, on examination, to be
   composed of a series of lesser and lesser bundles, firmly bound
   together in sheaths. "The dilatation of the muscular fibres in
   thickness, which accompanies their contraction in length, would, if
   these fibres had been loose and unconnected, have occasioned too great
   a separation and displacement, and have impeded their co-operation in
   one common effect. Nature has guarded against this evil by collecting a
   certain number of the elementary fibrils, and tying them together with
   threads of cellular substances, thus forming them into a larger fibre;
   and, again, packing a number of these fibres into larger bundles,
   always surrounding each packet with a web of cellular tissue." [82]

   As muscular action is wholly the result of the contractile power
   possessed by the tissue, it is obvious that reciprocal sets of such
   muscular bundles as we have described are necessary to produce the
   varied and reciprocal motions of animals. As Paley [83] states and
   illustrates the fact: "It is evident that the reciprocal energetic
   motion of the limbs, by which we mean motion with force in opposite
   directions, can only be produced by the instrumentality of opposite or
   antagonistic muscles--of flexors and extensors answering to each other.
   For instance, the muscles placed in the front part of the upper arm, by
   their contraction bend the elbow, and with such degree of force as the
   case requires or the strength admits of. The relaxation of these
   muscles after the effort would merely let the fore-arm drop down. For
   the back stroke, therefore, and that the arm may not only bend at the
   elbow, but also extend and straighten itself with force, other muscles,
   placed on the hinder part of the arms, by their contractile twitch,
   fetch back the fore-arm into a straight line with the cubit, with no
   less force than that with which it was beat out of it. The same thing
   obtains in all the limbs, and in every movable part of the body. A
   finger is not bent and straightened without the contraction of two
   muscles taking place. It is evident, therefore, that the animal
   functions require that particular disposition of the muscles which we
   describe by the name of antagonist muscles. And they are accordingly so
   disposed. Every muscle is provided with an adversary. They act, like
   two sawyers in a pit, by an opposite pull; and nothing surely can more
   strongly indicate design and attention to an end than their being thus
   stationed." To which Sir C. Bell in a note adds: "The muscles are
   antagonists certainly, but there is a fine combination and adjustment
   in their action, which is not illustrated by the two sawyers dividing a
   log of wood. The muscle having finished what we call its action or
   contraction, is not in the condition of a loose rope, but, on the
   contrary, there is always a perfect balance of action preserved between
   the extent of relaxation of the one class of muscles and the
   contraction of the other; and there is a tone in both by which the limb
   may be sustained in any posture that is willed."

   The muscles are attached by tendons or sinews to the parts to be moved;
   and there is often singular contrivance shown in the mode in which
   these are made to act. The most obvious and simple mode of producing
   motion, would of course be to stretch the tendons in a straight line
   betwixt the parts to be moved. But this would not, in many cases, suit
   the convenience of the body. The muscles are, in consequence, found in
   positions whence they can only act on the movable object in an oblique
   manner, and with a corresponding loss of force, but, at the same time,
   with an increase of velocity, and a saving of muscular contraction
   highly advantageous. Muscles acting after this oblique fashion are
   often used in pairs, in which case the direction of motion is the
   diagonal line between them,--an arrangement which, in certain movements
   of the body, is productive of a rapid and easy motion particularly
   desirable. The action of the chest in breathing is of this kind. [84]

   In certain parts of the body, where mobility is especially requisite, a
   condensation of muscular fibres would have been especially
   incommodious. By a skilful provision, the muscles are in such cases
   placed at a distance, where their presence is subservient to the beauty
   of the corporeal outline; while they are, at the same time, by a
   special apparatus of long tendons, stretching like wires from a
   mechanical centre, brought within range of their appropriate sphere of
   action. It is in this way that the muscles which move the hands and
   feet are found respectively in the arm and the calf of the leg, instead
   of forming, as Paley expresses it, an "unwieldy tumefaction in the
   hands and feet themselves. The observation," he adds, "may be repeated
   of the muscle which draws the nictitating membrane over the eye. Its
   office is in the front of the eye, but its body is lodged in the back
   part of the globe, where it lies safe, and where it encumbers nothing."
   [85]

   There are many other advantages connected with the use of tendons which
   have been carefully pointed out. [86] By their intervention the whole
   concentrated power of the muscular fibres is conveniently brought to
   bear upon any particular point where an accumulation of force is
   necessary. The action is upon the very same principle on which a number
   of men pull together at a rope, in order to influence by their combined
   strength a given position. By means of tendons, also, a change of
   direction may be imparted to the moving power, without any alteration
   of its place. Tendons are thus found, in numerous instances, "to pass
   round corners of bones, and along grooves or channels expressly formed
   for their transmission, producing the effect of pulleys." The trochlear
   muscle of the eye acts in this manner. It passes round a cartilaginous
   support and turns back, just like a rope round a pulley. By a similar
   mode of muscular action the lower jaw is pulled down, the moving power
   proceeding not from below but from above the jaw--rising, in fact, in
   the side of the face, and of course descending in the first instance,
   but, at a certain point, taking a turn and then ascending--which is the
   direction in which it could alone produce the appropriate effect. [87]

   The peculiar configuration of certain muscles serves still further to
   show the design with which they are marked. In many cases "the fibres,
   instead of running parallel to one another, are made either to converge
   or to diverge, in order to suit particular kinds of movements; and we
   frequently find that different portions of the same muscle have the
   power of contracting independently of the rest, so as to be capable of
   producing very various effects, according as they act separately or in
   combination." [88] The muscle of the back, called the trapezius, is an
   example of this. Sometimes they radiate from a common centre, as in the
   delicate muscle of the ear-drum; and at other times they run in a
   circular direction, forming what is called an orbicular or sphincter
   muscle. In the membrane of the eye called the iris these two
   last-mentioned muscles are combined with beautiful effect. On the
   application of too much light, the circular fibres directly surrounding
   the pupil instantaneously contract, diminishing its size; while again,
   when more light is needed, the contraction of the radiating fibres,
   acting on the circular, serves as instantaneously to enlarge the pupil.
   The instinctive character of this balanced action (the will having but
   a slight and occasional control over it) especially evinces foresight;
   for thus alone does it respond with unerring precision to all the
   varying necessities and circumstances of the animal. A somewhat
   corresponding action of circular fibres with longitudinal,
   distinguishes the muscular coats surrounding canals of various kinds,
   such as the blood-vessels, and the alimentary tube; the former tending,
   by their contraction, to extend the canal and propel its contents--the
   latter, again, by their contraction, having a tendency to shorten it.
   [89]

   One of the most general and remarkable characteristics of muscular
   action in the limbs remains to be mentioned. It takes place at what is
   called a mechanical disadvantage. The axis of motion is much nearer to
   the exciting force than to the resistance to be overcome. There is, of
   course, a great sacrifice of power in this way; but while this is
   compensated, on the one hand, by the special energy of the muscular
   exertion, on the other hand, velocity and freedom of motion (which are
   the great requisites in the animal system) are obtained in proportion
   to the mechanical disadvantage. "Strength is sacrificed," as Dr Roget
   observes, [90] "without scruple, to beauty of form or convenience of
   purpose; and that disposition of the force is always adopted from
   which, on the whole, the greatest practical benefit results. Everywhere
   do we find the wisest adaptation of muscular power to the objects
   proposed, whether it be exerted in laborious efforts of the limbs and
   trunk; whether employed in balancing the frame or urging it into quick
   progression; or whether it be applied to direct the delicate evolutions
   of the fingers, the rapid movements of the organs of speech, or the
   more exquisite adjustments of the eye, or of the internal ear."

   It were difficult, indeed, to conceive a more impressive display of
   design than is represented by all the varied and intricate action of
   the muscular system in any of the higher animals, and in the human
   frame especially. All is hidden from our view beneath the covering of
   skin which encases and protects the delicate machinery. But could we
   see within, and trace the unceasing play of muscular adjustment under
   any of our most common movements, nothing could be more wonderful than
   the spectacle exhibited. The movement of the eye in vision, of the ear
   in hearing, of the tongue and larynx in speaking, all depend upon
   relations of the nicest and most complicated description, whose
   operation, unceasing as it is, is at the same time unwearying. How
   wonderful the muscular endurance of the heart alone, which contracts
   "with a force equal to sixty pounds eighty times every minute, for
   eighty years together, without being tired!" [91] When the hand
   performs any common task--executes a piece of music, for example, or
   simply writes--how numerous the muscles brought into play, and yet how
   happily measured, definite, and wholly uninterfering their mutual
   action! "Not a letter," as Paley has well described the latter case,
   "can be turned without more than one, or two, or three tendinous
   contractions--definite, both as to the choice of the tendon, and as to
   the space through which the contraction moves; yet how currently does
   the work proceed! and when we look at it, how faithful have the muscles
   been to their duty! how true to the order which endeavour or habit hath
   inculcated!" [92]

   The disposition of so many muscles in the human body (anatomists have
   given names to between four and five hundred), often so closely
   contiguous to one another, that they are found "in layers, as it were,
   over one another, crossing one another, sometimes imbedded in one
   another, sometimes perforating one another," yet all so perfectly
   arranged that they never obstruct or interfere with one another--this
   of itself surely furnishes evidence of design which it is impossible to
   resist. What, save prescient Wisdom, could have devised an arrangement
   at once so exquisitely intervolved, and so faultlessly harmonious?

   In advancing to a brief consideration of the nervous system, we enter
   upon a sphere of illustration peculiarly significant for our subject.
   For the nerves are not, like the muscles, simply examples of organic
   contrivance; they are the seats of sensation, the media of animal
   consciousness, in whose varied phenomena we find the appropriate
   evidence, not only of Divine wisdom, but especially of Divine goodness.
   In this chapter, however, we glance at the nervous system simply in its
   organic arrangement, as contributing, in the mere complicacy and order
   of its parts, to the force of our preceding evidence. The mental
   meaning, which everywhere underlies it, will immediately receive full
   attention.

   The nervous, like the muscular system, is found, in the lower animal
   races, in a very undeveloped state. In the very lowest, indeed,
   including the Porifera (sponges); Polypifera (mushroom corals);
   Polygastrica (infusory animalcules); Acalephae (sea-blubbers); and
   Entozoa (intestinal worms), no trace of it can be detected by the
   closest scrutiny. These animals are hence arranged by zoologists into a
   sub-kingdom by themselves, under the name of Acrita. It must not,
   however, be supposed that the neurine or nervous matter is really
   absent in these races. It is no doubt present, although it cannot be
   traced; not gathered into masses, nor even into threads, but probably
   diffused in imperceptible atoms through the whole of their very simple
   structure.*

   In the races immediately above the preceding, the nervous matter is
   distinctly visible in the shape of threads dispersed through the body.
   They are hence arranged in a sub-kingdom, under the name of
   Nematoneura, the most interesting and important section of which are
   the Echinodermata, or star-fishes.

   162 THEISM.

   In the Articulata we reach a further and very significant development
   of the nervous structure. It is no longer merely in the form of
   threads, but presents the first appearance of a spinal chord, with
   ganglions or nervous centres collected on it; that is to say, knots or
   swellings at regular intervals along it, from which the nervous fibres
   run. From the fact that these ganglions are, in the Articulata,
   regularly disposed along the main line or chord to which they are
   attached, it has been proposed to call this general division of the
   animal kingdom Homogangliata, as being a name more truly distinctive
   than the older and familiar one of Articulata. The varied and deeply
   interesting class of insects, as also the Arachnida (spiders, &c.), and
   Crustacea (crabs, &c.), are representatives of this great division.

   In the Mollusca the nervous system does not advance. They are
   distinguished, Professor Owen has remarked, by the development rather
   of the vegetal series of organs, or those which are concerned in
   nutrition and reproduction. The nervous matter is in them also
   collected into ganglions; but these are no longer symmetrically
   disposed along a main line, but are unequally scattered throughout the
   body. "The principal mass of nervous matter takes the form of a thick
   ring or collar surrounding the gullet, whence threads are sent off in
   an unsymmetrical manner to other parts of the body; several ganglions
   being placed around the collar, and others dispersed in other parts, so
   as best to supply the most important organs." [93] From this unequal
   distribution of the nervous centres in the races of this division of
   the animal creation, it has been proposed to apply to them the more
   definite and characteristic name of Heterogangliata.

   It is only in the Vertebrata that we reach the fully developed form of
   the nervous system. Here we have a spinal chord, truly so called, not
   only with ganglionic knots distributed along it, but expanded at the
   summit into a collection of nervous matter, which gradually becomes of
   main significance in the system. To this terminal collection of nervous
   matter the general name of brain is given. In all the classes of the
   Vertebrata a brain and spinal marrow are present, but the brain
   especially is extremely diversified in size, and in the relation of its
   parts. It is composed of two hemispheres, respectively named the
   cerebrum or proper brain, and the cerebellum or lesser brain. It is by
   the full development of the former that the nervous system in the human
   species is distinguished. It extends so far back in man as to cover the
   whole of the cerebellum, while, in the lower vertebrate orders, the
   latter becomes always more apparent, till in reptiles and in fishes it
   is wholly exposed.

   With this very summary description of the nervous system in the animal
   races generally, we will now look, for the sake of special
   illustration, a little more closely at its structure and operations in
   man, in whom it assumes its chief interest and importance.

   The nervous matter in the human body presents the appearance of an
   elaborate and intricate trace-work running out to all its parts, from
   the vertebrate column and encephalon. Comparatively dense and unformed
   in the immediate region of the central line or axis of the body, it
   branches off into more rare and distinct outline towards the surface
   extremities. When this matter, as exhibited in the brain, is examined,
   it is found to be composed of two different substances. The main
   substance, which is placed internally, is white-looking and of fibrous
   structure. A coating of grey matter, vesicular in structure, encloses
   the other, and gathers into large ganglionic masses at the base, where
   it constitutes, as we shall see, a special centre of nervous force.
   This twofold material is found also in the spinal marrow, but in an
   inverted relation, the grey matter here forming the interior, and the
   white matter the exterior mass. The grey or vesicular matter is
   supposed to be the generating source of the nervous energy, the white
   or fibrous matter to form the lines of communication between the
   different parts of the system.

   In the diversified operation of man's nervous system, we meet, first of
   all, with centres of nervous action, strictly corresponding to those
   found in the lower orders, viz., simple ganglions, distributed along
   the spine, or at least chiefly there. But we also, as might be
   expected, meet with higher and peculiar centres of such action in what
   are called the sensory ganglions, collected at the base of the brain,
   and especially in the cerebrum itself. From these respective centres
   emanates the whole varied and wonderful activity of human life.

   To Sir Charles Bell we are indebted for the great discovery which has
   opened up the whole field of nervous operation. He found that sensation
   and motion are dependent upon different sets of nervous filaments. The
   sensiferous filaments, stretching all along the surface of the body,
   are constantly receiving impulses which they transmit along the line to
   the different centres of nervous action, whence again proceed the other
   or motor set of filaments running to all the different parts of the
   body. These filaments start from distinct roots in the nervous
   column--the roots of the former being in the posterior, and those of
   the latter in the anterior, portions of that column. They preserve
   throughout their distinct character and quality, although in their
   ramifications they become inextricably intermingled. According to their
   function, the former set have been called afferent, as conveying
   impressions towards the centre; the latter efferent, as conveying the
   respondent movement from the centre. [94] We have thus, in the most
   simple form of nervous operation, three distinct organs, as it
   were--the afferent nerve, the gangiionic centre, and the efferent
   nerve. These together form an apparatus which has often been
   represented by the analogy of a voltaic battery. The impression
   communicated at the sensitive surface passes along the line of the
   afferent nerve to the central station, where it is not expended or
   thrown away, but, in virtue of its nature, acts upon the vascular
   structure of the ganglions, developing a motive force which issues
   along the efferent nerve to the parts originally affected. An act or
   operation of sense always tends to complete itself in this way. The
   stimulus passing inwards is reflected to the sentient surface whence it
   started, quickening there a movement of closer contact, or, as it may
   be, of repulsion towards the object of sensation. When we touch
   anything, we have thus a tendency either to grasp it more firmly, or to
   reject it, should there be anything in it disagreeable to the organs of
   sensation. Without one or other of these results the sensation has not
   completed its natural round. It has fallen short through its own
   original weakness, or the weakness of some of the organs; or, as is
   very commonly the case, in the ceaseless and complex play of the
   system, it has been interfered with by some opposing influence of
   greater power bearing on the same centre of nervous force.

   The intimate union which is thus seen to exist between the nervous and
   muscular systems is deserving of notice. The action of the one always
   tends to pass into that of the other. The two systems are not only
   combined, but so combined, or rather inwrought, that the one everywhere
   presupposes and includes the other.

   We have been speaking all along of sensation as implied in the nervous
   process; and so it is. But, in the very lowest forms of this process,
   that which we peculiarly mean by sensation does not emerge. There are,
   in other words, appropriate ranges of nervous action which transact
   themselves beyond the region of consciousness. Among these are the
   common functions of organic life--the action of the heart, of the
   lungs, and of the stomach. These, as well as sometimes also special
   motions of the limbs, are found, in a state of health, to proceed
   wholly irrespective of any conscious recognition or sensation properly
   so called. The sense-impulses which have set them agoing do not, as it
   were, awaken, or realise themselves. And in this we may perceive a
   special mark of Divine wisdom; for how important is it that those
   functions upon which our daily health depends, should be thus secured
   from the distracting influences that would be otherwise constantly
   bearing upon them! How comparatively imperfect and unhappy would life
   be, did the respiratory or digestive processes incessantly claim our
   attention! As it is, these processes, proceeding in a separate round by
   themselves, minister in the most faithful and efficient manner to our
   daily maintenance and well-being.

   Such simple reflex actions constitute in man, however, only the lowest
   circle of nervous operation. And even in regard to them there is so
   intimate a relation between the different parts of the system, that the
   processes which may be, and in ordinary cases are, transacted beyond
   the region of consciousness, yet very readily pass into it. For,
   according to the full law of nervous action, whose exposition we owe
   only to the most recent physiological labours, every impression is
   represented as having a tendency to pass along the nerve of
   transmission upwards through every intermediate position to the
   cerebrum itself. [95] This tendency, we have seen, is not in many cases
   carried out. The nervous impression is intercepted at a lower
   ganglionic centre, and reflected there for the performance of various
   important functions. Yet, even in those cases in which there is no
   conscious recognition, the relation of the nerves to the higher
   conscious centre is so intimate that some influence is probably at all
   times given forth upon it.

   The reflections from the sensory ganglions at the base of the brain may
   be said to form the second range of nervous action in man, which, in
   its special character, is of the most important kind. These ganglions
   are the great seat of sensation. The nerves of the senses terminate in
   them, and hence proceed all our well-known modes of sensation, so
   various and exquisite. But while this range of nervous action lies so
   completely within the sphere of feeling and consciousness, it is yet
   irrespective of the will. The responsive movements flow forth
   instinctively; they are the simple involuntary play of sensations. Such
   automatic movements are the winking of the eye, shuddering, balancing
   of the body to prevent falling, and many others.

   The highest and complete range of nervous action proceeds from the
   cerebrum itself. While, in truth, the lower ganglionic centres are so
   constituted as to be capable of originating independent ranges of
   action, they are yet so intimately related to this highest centre as to
   be constantly within its influence. The effects, for example, of
   intense thought or of strong emotion upon the processes of organic life
   are familiarly known. It is deserving of remark, however, that this
   cerebral influence can only be propagated downwards after a certain
   manner. The mind can only influence directly the sensory ganglions, the
   sensations which are the appropriate expression of their action again
   acting upon the lower ganglionic centres concerned in the processes in
   question. The idea of a pleasant taste, for example, will make the
   mouth water, and the sensation thus created will stimulate, through the
   inferior excito-motor centre, the action of the stomach. But the mind
   cannot operate directly upon the alimentary apparatus.

   The cerebrum, it is well known, is the special seat of those varied
   ideas and emotions which constitute what is peculiarly considered our
   mental activity. It is the seat, moreover, of that moral activity which
   in man is the flower of existence. In the will, as the only complete
   expression of our cerebral energy, the whole complex human life does
   not certainly take its rise, but here alone it finds its sum and
   perfection. What grounds there may be for reckoning in the cerebrum two
   distinct centres of nervous action--an idea-motor, so called and
   described by Dr Laycock, [96] and one (the highest of all) specially
   volitional [97] --need not occupy us in so cursory and second-hand a
   sketch as this.

   We have presented more than enough to evince the clear design stamped
   on every feature of man's nervous system. On the one hand, its
   elaborate structure, so nicely and curiously wrought, and on the other
   hand, its diversified yet never conflicting action, are among the most
   impressive manifestations of a wisdom which, shining forth everywhere
   in nature, here shines forth with, perhaps, special significance and
   beauty. It were a vain effort to exalt any one aspect of creation above
   another, Divine order being equally conspicuous in all; yet it would
   seem that here, in the exquisite organisation which we have been
   contemplating, Reason is eminent with a peculiar lustre. Here, standing
   at the summit of the physical, on the verge of that self-conscious
   reason which sees its own forms reflected everywhere, we seem to see
   the most perfect correspondence between matter and spirit--between the
   order that merely shows Mind, and the mind that perceives Order. The
   pious instinct which, on a comparatively inadequate view, lifted the
   soul of the Psalmist to God, here awakens irrepressibly in every
   reverent heart, "I will praise Thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully
   made."

§ II.--CHAPTER VIII.

  TYPICAL FORMS DIVINE WISDOM.

   THE general conception of order with which we set out, has in the few
   last chapters become mixed up with the more special conception of
   design. The teleological aspect of organic phenomena is that which most
   readily fixes the attention of the Natural Theologian, as it is that
   which has hitherto proved the most successful key of discovery in
   prosecuting their study. Under the influence of the illustrious Cuvier,
   this teleological view had assumed such a prominence in physiology as
   almost to obscure the more general view of a unity of plan or order. Of
   late, however, and especially through the profound and laborious
   researches of Professor Owen, this latter view has begun to claim
   renewed interest. In his two works--"On the Archetype and Homologies of
   the Vertebrate Skeleton," and "On the Nature of Limbs"--he has
   especially shown its value and fruitfulness as a guiding principle of
   investigation in comparative anatomy; and the same principle has, in
   truth, been gaining ground in the whole region of physiology, as
   probably furnishing, here no less than in other departments, the
   deepest and most pervading key of explanation. It is felt now, at
   length, after the extravagance of polemic on either side has passed
   away, that there is no necessary contradiction between the more special
   and the more comprehensive and yet grander doctrine.

   We have already seen the numerical relation which subsists between the
   different parts of plants. In the great division of the vegetable
   kingdom, 3 is found to be the pervading or typical number of the
   monocotyledonous plants, and 5 the pervading or typical number of the
   dicotyledonous. This numerical unity is found, on closer examination,
   to be merely a single indication of the typical unity which, throughout
   the whole range of the vegetable kingdom, underlies its infinite
   variety. Beneath all this variety, apparently and in reality so
   boundless, there emerges to the critical gaze an identity of form of
   the most interesting and wonderful character.

   The science which treats of this pervading feature of the organic
   kingdom has been termed Morphology, [98] and has within the last
   half-century drawn the special attention of naturalists. In so far as
   it relates to botany, Professor Schleiden has devoted one of the
   chapters of his very attractive work, The Plant, a Biography, to the
   subject. He thus describes the importance of form to the plant, and the
   frequent subordination of every other thing to it:--

   "Whether it arises from the essential nature of the circumstances or
   not, we cannot say, but, at least so far as appearance goes, the
   production of shape is so prominent a point in the natural history of
   plants, that all the rest has often been forgotten for its sake; and
   thus the study of form, or morphology, becomes in any case the most
   important branch of teaching in all botany. But it would be a great
   mistake to suppose that morphology is merely a meagre enunciation and
   description of forms. It is also a scientific question; it has to seek
   for the knowledge of laws, and must, at least as a preliminary step,
   arrange the multitude of appearances under primary points of view,
   place them according to rule and exception, and so gradually approach
   nearer to the discovery of the actual laws of nature." [99]

   The fundamental idea of morphology, therefore, is the recognition of a
   common type of construction among plants and animals. In the case of
   the former, with which we are immediately concerned, science,
   penetrating beneath the mere diversity of organs, and their enumeration
   and classification, discerns a persistent unity of plan or law, upon
   which the whole plant, in its various and complicated structure, is
   moulded. And it is remarkable that this beautiful conception, to which
   science owes so much, was, in the first instance, due to the vivid
   intuition of a poetic, rather than the patient induction of a merely
   scientific mind. It was to the fine and subtle glance of Goethe,
   roaming through nature with so rich a perception of its harmonies, that
   typical forms of structure, in the vegetable world, first revealed
   themselves. His Versuch die Metamorphose der Pflanzen zu erklären, in
   1790, contained the first formal exposition of the doctrine of typical
   unity, and must, therefore, be considered to have laid the basis of
   scientific botany. It was not, however, till thirty years later, when
   the speculations of Goethe were taken up by de Candolle, and embodied
   in his work on Organography, that they attracted general attention, and
   passed into the scientific mind of Europe. The idea of the poet only
   then became the recognised doctrine of science.

   Goethe, drawn to nature from the promptings of its mirrored harmony
   within him, carried over, as might be supposed, a somewhat too ideal
   view of unity to the plant. His idea of a typical plant, "whereby he
   signified an ideal plant, the realisation of which, as it were, nature
   had proposed to herself, and which she had only attained in a certain
   degree in the individual plants," is considered by Schleiden to be
   deficient in clearness and grasp of reality. And it would indeed have
   been wonderful if the first fresh glance of the poet had expressed with
   perfect precision the deep-seated truth of nature. It cannot even now
   be said that the fundamental forms of vegetable structure have been
   precisely determined; some, with Schleiden himself, finding a radical
   twofoldness, and others aiming to establish a unity [100] as the most
   general plan of the plant. It is only by very patient and comprehensive
   processes of induction that the most hidden order of organic nature can
   ever be discovered. As Schleiden says, "glorious systems may, indeed,
   be thought out on paper in the study, but these have no meaning or
   importance in the actual world. Thus, as we enter upon these things, we
   must rather modestly inquire whether nature is inclined to display her
   mysteries to us,--whether she will, in this or that individual
   instance, make manifest what characters are essential in their shape;
   in a word, what basis she will afford us for the erection of our
   system."

   It will suffice for our general purpose to present a very brief sketch
   of the now established reduction of the plant to a twofold type of
   structure, as exhibited by Schleiden. The two representative organs, to
   which all the others can be reduced, are the stem and the leaf. The
   root, and the trunk With its lateral branches, and these again with
   their lateral branchlets, are simple modifications of the former. All
   these are of "the same structure, and tend to assume the same form."
   [101] "If a thousand branches from the same tree are compared
   together," says Lindley, "they will be found to be formed upon the same
   uniform plan, and to accord in every essential particular. Each branch
   is also, under favourable circumstances, capable of itself becoming a
   separate individual, as is found by cuttings, buddings, grafting, and
   other horticultural processes." Each branch or branchlet, therefore, is
   simply the plant repeating itself, in diversified outline, as it
   advances in growth--each containing within itself the germ of
   individual existence, and ready to become an individual plant on the
   application of the proper means. The term phyton has accordingly been
   given with propriety to each single part.

   Upon the stem, and out of it, grows the leaf, which, in its turn, is
   the undoubted type of all the special organs of inflorescence, the
   calyx, corolla, stamens, and pistils. The sepals of the calyx, and the
   petals of the corolla, or flower commonly so called, are obviously
   enough foliar in their structure. But the stamens and pistils have been
   proved to be no less so, little as, on a mere cursory inspection of
   them, this might seem to be the case.

   The plant, in its most complete development, is therefore capable of
   analysis into two distinct parts--a twofold system of constructive
   order. The diversity of stem and flower is seen to flow from a typical
   unity in each case; and some have carried back, as we have said, the
   whole diversity to a radical unity in the stem. If we cannot
   contemplate the special relations and uses of different organs of the
   plant without recognising in them the clear marks of design, it is no
   less impossible, surely, to contemplate this wonderful unity of
   organisation--this plan of structure, underlying the whole vegetable
   creation--without the conception of Mind forcing itself irrepressibly
   upon us.

   But this conclusion is still more strongly enforced by the most general
   glance at the result of Professor Owen's researches in comparative
   anatomy. The labours of this great investigator have opened up a new
   field of interest and significance in anatomical science. Carrying
   along with him the principles and conclusions of Cuvier, he soon found
   that their very force impelled him forward to a more profound and
   comprehensive principle of discovery, which, while it had been
   perverted by the arbitrariness of previous theorisers, is yet of
   incalculable value and importance. The simple fact of corresponding
   bones in different species, freely recognised by former anatomists,
   became significant to him of a great doctrine of homology, running
   through the whole of the vertebrate skeleton. By the term homology he
   expresses the unity or identity of character between the bones so
   answering to one another in different animals. The bones themselves he
   calls "homologues," in contradistinction to "analogues," which he
   applies to parts performing the same function; whereas homologous
   parts, identical in character, may exhibit every variety of form and
   function--are the same organs, in fact, under whatever change of
   circumstances. Thus the fore limbs of a quadruped, the wings of a bird,
   the pectoral fins of a fish, and the arms of man, are respectively
   homologous, because they are really the same organs, only differently
   modified; while again the wings of Draco volans are merely analogous to
   the wings of a bird; [102] each organ performing the same function, but
   being wholly different in structure.

   Throughout the vertebrate skeleton--from that of the fish, the reptile,
   and bird, to that of the mammal--from the cetaceans up to man Professor
   Owen has demonstrated that there are no fewer than seventy of such
   homologous bones, which may be clearly traced, showing the uniform
   plan, or archetypal model, upon which the whole vertebrate races have
   been formed. This vertebrate archetype has been figured by him; and, in
   connection with the respective type-skeletons of the fish, the reptile,
   the bird, and the beast, is said to constitute a perfect anatomical
   study. With the details of the subject we feel ourselves incompetent to
   meddle; but the great conclusion is one which claims our earnest
   attention--the fact, namely, of the demonstrated unity of constructive
   plan underlying all the singular diversity of the vertebrate form. What
   a pregnant fact is this! and how vast a scheme of order does it open up
   in the animal creation! "If there be," says Professor Sedgwick, "an
   archetype in the vertebrate division of animated nature, we may well
   ask whether there may not be a more general archetype that runs through
   the whole kingdom of the living world. In a certain sense there is. All
   animals, if we except the Radiata, which come close to a vegetable
   type, are bilateral and symmetrical, [103] have double organs of sense,
   and have a nervous and vascular system, with many parts in very near
   homology, even when we put side by side, for comparison, the animal
   forms taken from the opposite extreme of nature's scale. And even in
   the Radiata, where we, at first sight, seem to lose all traces of the
   vertebrate type, on a better examination many of the genera are proved
   still to be bilateral and symmetrical."

   There is in this grand conception of typical order a significance for
   our subject in some respects quite peculiar. Even if it were the case,
   therefore, that the teleological principle of Cuvier suffered any
   abatement of its lustre (which, according to a just view, it is yet far
   from doing) from the promulgation of this more comprehensive principle,
   the theistic argument would still be far from sustaining any loss. It
   gains, on the contrary, more than by any possibility it could lose. As
   if the homage which science had already from all quarters rendered to
   it were not enough, this latest advance of physiology has returned
   laden with an offering of most precious and conclusive meaning.

   The essential question of Theism, we formerly saw, resolved itself into
   one regarding the rightful relation of man's reason to the world at
   large. Is this reason entitled to bring the manifold life of nature
   within its own forms, to embrace the cosmical vastness in its own
   mirror? We found that, in the nature of the case, it is and must be so
   entitled, as the very condition of science or of truth at all. Reason
   is not merely a growth of nature, but truly an emanation from the
   Divine Source of nature, and therefore validly brings all nature within
   its laws. Now, looking at these latest discoveries of physiological
   science, are they not found to bear an emphatic testimony to this
   fundamental position? For what is the typical order recognised as
   pervading creation but the signal expression of a reason allied to
   man's, and yet above it? What is the evidence of an ideal archetype for
   the world, or any part of it, but the special evidence of a Mind
   subsisting apart from the world, and antecedent to it? For it is clear
   that such an archetype could never have existed--such a pattern could
   never have been stamped on creation so deeply inlaid that we are only
   now discovering it--without a Mind to conceive and plan it. In the
   language of Professor Owen--language of the highest interest for our
   subject--"The recognition of an ideal exemplar for the vertebrated
   animals, proves that the knowledge of such a being as man must have
   existed before man appeared. For the Divine Mind which planned the
   archetype also foreknew all its modifications. The archetypal idea was
   manifested in the flesh, under divers modifications, upon this planet,
   long prior to the existence of those animal species that actually
   exemplify it. To what natural or secondary causes the orderly
   succession and progression of such organic phenomena may have been
   committed, we are as yet ignorant. But if, without derogation to the
   Divine Power, we may conceive the existence of such ministers, and
   personify them by the term Nature, we learn, from the past history of
   our globe, that she has advanced with slow and stately steps, guided by
   the archetypal light amidst the wreck of worlds,--from the first
   embodiment of the vertebrate idea, under its old ichthyic vestment,
   until it became arranged in the glorious garb of the human form."

   And here appropriately our evidence for the special fact of the Divine
   wisdom may be said to culminate. Speaking to us everywhere in the laws
   of nature--in the special ends of organic functions--it seems in these
   last chapters to rise before us with a clear and vivid force of the
   most irresistible kind. In all the intricate diversity, and yet vast
   archetypal unity of organic life, we seem to see with a brightness,
   undimmed by intervening medium, the impress of a Wisdom as grand in
   simplicity as it is boundless in fertility. [104]

   [104] The evidence which this archetypal order or unity of plan in
   creation furnishes of the unity of the Divine Being, is, moreover,
   deserving of notice. Here, too, the language of Professor Owen is
   expressive of that sound Christian philosophy, which in him, as in so
   many of the highest minds of our country, is found in beautiful unison
   with the most eminent scientific attainments. "The evidence," he says,
   "of unity of plan in the structure of animals, testifies to the oneness
   of their Creator, as the modifications of the plan for different modes
   of life illustrate the beneficence of the Designer."

  MENTAL ORDER.

   IN advancing to this farther and higher branch of our illustrative
   evidence, we do not consider it necessary to enter into any formal
   proof of mind as a substance essentially distinct from matter. That it
   is so distinct has been assumed in the whole course of our preliminary
   reasoning, and quite warrantably so. For, to say the least, mind is as
   much entitled, apart from proof, to be held a distinct reality as
   matter. Nay, of the two, there cannot be any doubt to the genuine
   thinker which is the real, primary, and constitutive element of
   knowledge: and for the materialist, therefore, to demand a proof of the
   separate existence of mind, and for the philosopher or theologian to
   grant him the validity of this demand, is simply among the absurdities
   which have sprung out of the degradation both of philosophy and
   theology. [105] The right of question, the burden of proof, lies
   plainly all the other way; matter per se, nature independently of mind,
   being, according to our whole reasoning, as well as according to all
   true philosophy, the simply inconceivable and inexplicable.

   It is only the fact of mind, the reality of a rational consciousness in
   man, which at once gives occasion to the theistic problem, and forms
   the condition of its solution. It is only to reason that the question
   could ever arise, Is there a God? It is only reason that could ever
   originate an answer to this question. Mind, therefore, in its full and
   comprehensive sense--the sense in which we made such frequent use of it
   in our first chapters--is an element of wholly peculiar significance
   for our argument. It is the condition of it from the beginning. Within
   the mental or rational sphere alone does the argument find a footing;
   and within this sphere alone, as we shall afterwards see, does it find
   its completion. It goes forth into the world of phenomena everywhere,
   seeking illustration and confirmation; but the rational human spirit,
   the nou`s, which is one and abiding amid all variety and fluctuation of
   phenomena, is alone the home of its birth, and equally of its full
   maturity and strength.

   This radical and distinctive importance of mind must not for a moment
   be overlooked in the course of our evidence. But mind also presents
   itself to us in another point of view. In its complex and various
   manifestations, it furnishes also an illustrative contribution to our
   argument. It is not only, according to its fundamental theistic
   meaning, the essential correlate and condition of order everywhere, but
   is itself, viewed objectively, in its manifold expressions, an
   illustration of order of the most interesting and impressive kind.
   Mental phenomena bring their own appropriate testimony to the Divine
   wisdom, while their specialty, beyond all mere material facts, enables
   us for the first time to trace in an inductive manner the Divine
   goodness.

   The field of theistic illustration afforded by mental phenomena has
   not, indeed, been very much frequented by natural theologians. Lord
   Brougham, in his discourse on Natural Theology, adverted to this
   neglect, and so far took up the subject in one of the sections of that
   work. But at the same time he has done little really to rescue it from
   the neglect of which he complained; and it may be doubted, from his
   partial treatment of it, whether he fully understood its character and
   importance. Dr Chalmers, in his Natural Theology, has dealt more
   adequately with certain parts of our mental constitution in their
   theistic interpretation; but he has left other parts of it, equally
   significant, wholly untouched.

   The truth is, that there is peculiar difficulty in dealing with mental
   phenomena for our purpose. They are at once so confluent and subtle in
   themselves, and so encompassed with debate and uncertainty, arising out
   of the ceaseless polemic of philosophy, that the theologian has
   naturally sought for illustrations of his argument in a less difficult
   and fluctuating class of phenomena. At the same time, the very
   character of mental phenomena, in their higher complicacy and
   refinement, only renders them the more richly fitted to display the
   Divine perfections, in so far as we can truly seize and represent them.
   The exquisite varieties of sensation, the marvellous structure of
   thought, the glorious workings of imagination, the infinite play of
   emotion, and the profound depths of passion, all speak with the most
   eloquent utterance of the Divine wisdom and beneficence.

   In the remaining chapters of this section, we endeavour to bring into
   view some of the theistic meaning, which may be everywhere traced in
   mental phenomena. The divisions which have been commonly made of these
   phenomena into those of sensation, cognition, and emotion, will
   successively engage us. We accept these divisions as serving
   sufficiently to characterise the complexity of our mental life, apart
   from those higher rational elements which afterwards, according to our
   plan, receive attention by themselves; and while our treatment, no less
   than that of the writers of which we have spoken, must be here very
   inadequate, it may yet include a sufficiently comprehensive survey of
   the whole field, as it presents itself, in such rich diversities of
   aspect, for inspection.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [105] The assumption that mind is nothing else than a material
   function, and that the science of mind is only the highest range of the
   general science of physiology, is one among the many specimens of the
   thoroughly unphilosophic procedure which characterises Positivism. The
   whole tone and reasoning of M. Comte on this subject (Philosophic
   Positive, tome ii. p. 766 et seq.) are in fact ignorantly arrogant to
   such a degree as to need no refutation. His followers in this country
   have expressly repudiated his confusion of psychology with physiology
   as merely one of its branches. Vide Mr MILL'S Logic, vol. ii. p.
   422-423, and Mr LEWES' Exposition of Positivism, p. 212. If any one
   desires to see the degraded and unintelligible substitute which, under
   the name of "a New Cerebral Theory," M. Comte would give us, in place
   of our mental philosophy, let him consult the statement of this theory,
   in the Politique Positive, or in the concluding section of the first
   part of Mr Lewes' volume.

§ II.--CHAPTER X.

  SENSATION--DIVINE GOODNESS.

   THE phenomena of sensation form in all cases the lowest range of mental
   life, while in many of the inferior races this life reaches no farther.
   There are some, indeed, to whom it may seem strange to speak of mind as
   expressed in mere sensation. But we have no other name by which to
   denote that higher element or presence beyond mere organic life, which
   sense, even in its lowest stages, implies. That which feels is
   everywhere something more than that which merely lives. Sense is only
   such in virtue of a sentient subject, which we can only conceive
   intelligibly, even in the brute creation, as the dim, crude, and
   frequently unawakened presence of mind. It is necessary, at the same
   time, that we carefully preserve the distinction of mind, as possessed
   by man, in its fully-expressed reality of reason. Any doubt on this
   point would leave our argument, or indeed any theistic argument, in a
   somewhat hopeless state of confusion and uncertainty.

   With this explanation, a mental presence is to be held as everywhere
   manifested in sensation. With every sensitive act there is ever,
   according to Sir William Hamilton, [106] a distinct forthputting of
   mental activity. A certain attitude of attention, blind as it may be,
   is necessary to constitute such an act; and hence it happens that, when
   attention is otherwise wholly absorbed, the mental life otherwise
   wholly engrossed, we can sustain the most severe bodily injuries
   without any feeling of pain.

   Sensations admit of an obvious classification in relation to the
   different organs on which they depend. In man they are commonly
   reckoned in a five-fold series, as the sensations of taste, smell,
   touch, hearing, and sight. It is, nevertheless, now almost universally
   admitted that this classification is not complete. Dr T. Brown
   contended for a sixth sense, under the name of the muscular sense, to
   which he traced various feelings generally ascribed to touch; and it
   cannot be doubted that there is a separate range of sensations of which
   our muscular frame is the appropriate organ. As this frame is tense or
   relaxed, as it moves rhythmically or convulsively (in shuddering, for
   example), or again, as it is vigorous or exhausted, it gives forth
   various impressions which enter into the sensory system, and form a
   large share of our daily sensational experience. In the very same
   manner the different affections flowing from the constant processes of
   vegetative life--those, for example, arising from a state of
   healthiness or disease, vigour or debility--and other affections still
   less defined, may very well claim to be ranked as distinct orders of
   sensations. It cannot be doubted that the feelings connected with such
   states of the bodily organisation, however diffused, make a large
   portion of the common consciousness, and of the happiness or misery of
   our common mental existence. It is not necessary for our purpose,
   however, to determine such matters of purely psychological
   classification.

   Of the five more specially recognised senses, taste and smell are
   rightly grouped by themselves; and again, hearing and sight stand in a
   similar group. Touch stands by itself, as in some respects the most
   important and necessary of all our senses.

   Taste and smell are intimately allied: they both convey impressions
   derived from the chemical qualities of bodies, the one in the fluid
   (substances tasted must be either naturally fluid, or must be dissolved
   by the saliva), the other in the gaseous state. They are chiefly
   instrumental as subserving the more physical wants of existence; and
   smell, from its subservience in this point of view, is well known to
   reach a much more intense and powerful development in some of the lower
   animals than in man.

   The senses of sight and hearing are more intellectual in their
   character and relations than the former. They carry the mind more
   outward, fixing it more upon the object awakening its regard. The
   former, as has been often pointed out, is more immediately related to
   the cognitive, the latter to the emotional powers, a relation which is
   thus curiously contrasted in a passage quoted by Mr Morell from
   Erdmann's Psychologische Briefe. "The one," says Erdman, "is the
   clearest, the other is the deepest of the senses. The same contrast
   shows itself in the objects by which these organs are severally
   affected. In the former case the object shows its outward surface, as
   it exists unmoved in space; in the latter case it betrays, by means of
   the tone it gives forth, what exists within and under the surface. It
   is not the form and colour of an object which tells what it is, but its
   sound. For that reason the sight of a thing does not penetrate so much
   to the heart, it only tells us what is its appearance. On the other
   hand, the tone moves us; it tells us how the thing or the person stands
   to the heart itself. On that account we can easily explain the
   phenomena so often observed, that deafness is hard and distrustful,
   while blindness is mild and confiding." [107]

   The sense of touch is peculiar in its range and the diversity of its
   applications. This extent and variety of operation constitute its
   importance and rank in comparison with the other senses; for, in point
   of mere intellectual dignity and refinement, it must certainly be
   classed below the sense of vision. It is the same characteristic which
   has led to that subdivision of its functions to which Dr T. Brown led
   the way, many separating with him the more objective phenomena of the
   sense, through which we are supposed to come to a clear knowledge of
   the primary qualities of matter--extension, solidity, hardness,
   &c.--from the more subjective phenomena, or those of feeling, strictly
   so called; and others ranging in a further separate class the
   sensations of temperature, usually considered to form merely a variety
   of those of touch.

   In the operation of these different senses, the unerring accuracy with
   which they guide the inferior orders in the selection of fitting
   nourishment, and their rich and varying, yet so nicely discriminating
   flow in man, we see the bright manifestations of the same provident
   wisdom which we have hitherto been tracing. Marvellously complex and
   beautiful as are the higher organs of hearing and sight, they must yet
   surely yield in endless intricacy of harmonious adjustment to the
   crowding sensations to which they minister. If the hand of a
   transcendent Wisdom be visible in the arrangements of the one, must it
   not be also impressively recognised in the yet subtler arrangements of
   the other?

   But it is not for the evidence of design, that may beyond doubt be here
   equally traced, that these phenomena possess a special interest for the
   Theist. Their peculiar significance consists not in the fact that in
   them also we see wisdom, but that in them, for the first time, we
   perceive goodness. In this new reality of creation we have a new
   testimony to the Creator. With the dawn of sense, we have the kindling
   of the light of love around the great First Cause. We behold no longer
   a merely exquisite mechanism, nor even the elaborately beautiful action
   of unconscious life, but the yet higher and richer workings of sentient
   being. In these workings there emerges for the first time the fact of
   enjoyment, and this fact in nature it is which alone enables us
   inductively to find goodness in God. Apart from this fact, Paley has
   said, with his wonted brief simplicity, "the attribute has no object,
   the term has no meaning." It is only the presence of a sentient subject
   in organism which enables us to pronounce that the tendency of its
   design is beneficial. It is only its relation to consciousness which
   makes anything good or evil.

   It becomes, then, for the theistic inference, a most vital and
   momentous--question Is enjoyment really the normal expression of
   sensation? Is happiness the prevailing response of consciousness? Is
   it, in short, "a happy world, after all? "What is the testimony which
   sentient life, in its manifold forms, utters on this great point? The
   true bearing of the question is to be carefully observed. It is not at
   all a question implying the non-existence of evil; on the contrary, it
   proceeds plainly on the supposition of evil being an undoubted reality.
   The truth is, that with the fact of pleasure, given in sensation, there
   emerges so inseparably the fact of pain--the one fact so directly
   suggests the other--that the induction as to the Divine goodness
   assumes, from the very first, a directly polemical aspect. It becomes a
   question in a different sense from the truth of the Divine power or
   wisdom; and we are so far from wishing to hide from view the obvious
   difficulty which thus meets us, that we frankly admit it in our very
   mode of stating the matter. While acknowledging the difficulty,
   however, we reserve it, according to the well-devised plan of our
   subject, for separate and special treatment. Pain is present along with
   pleasure--evil along with good; and it will be our subsequent aim to
   consider the solution of which this fact is capable. In the mean time,
   we simply inquire, Is not happiness present to such a degree in
   creation as to lead us to infer in the Creator a disposition to bestow
   happiness? Is not good so apparent in nature as to declare that its
   Author is good? Or--to place the matter before us in the strictly
   special form in which it has occurred in this chapter--is not the
   normal action of sense, enjoyment?

   To the question thus put we can only imagine one answer. When, with a
   clear mind and heart, we turn to nature, we see happiness expressing
   itself in endlessly multiplied forms. The play of conscious life is
   everywhere around us, and it is the play of enjoyment. Every one is
   familiar with the felicitous passage of Paley, descriptive of this
   prevailing happiness of sentient existence; and whatever shadows may
   lie in the background--obvious objections to which we have already
   adverted,--there cannot well be any dispute as to the truth as well as
   felicity of the Archdeacon's picture on the positive side. It cannot be
   rationally doubted that pleasure is the appropriate correlative of
   sensation everywhere. The natural meaning of feeling, so to speak, is
   happiness. Feeling is no doubt also liable to be pain; but--and this
   alone is the point of our present argument--pain is the exception,
   pleasure the rule. If a nerve be lacerated, it will unquestionably give
   forth a sensation of pain; but the expression of the nervous system is
   nevertheless, in all animals, according to its originally constituted
   working--or in other words, when not interfered with--pleasure. And
   this is what we intend by speaking of the normal action of sensation as
   pleasurable. The constitution of animal life is such that it yields, in
   harmonious operation, enjoyment. The design, therefore, of that
   constitution is clearly benevolent, even if it were, in the actual
   circumstances of the case, more liable to interference than it is. In
   truth, however, it is not only designed to evolve happiness, but so
   secured in its working that the design is for the most part effectually
   accomplished.

   Happiness ascends million-voiced to the great Source of Being day by
   day. It is a living, if often inarticulate speech, diffused through
   creation, and warming it everywhere with the breath of thanksgiving. It
   is a song of natural piety which is new every morning, and fails not
   every evening, although many jars mingle in the wide-toned benedicite.
   These mar the harmony of the song, but it still goes upwards, a
   pervading strain of happiness, in testimony of the Love from which it
   comes, and in which alone it lives.

§ II.--CHAPTER XI.

  INSTINCT.

   BEFORE passing onward in our inductive psychological survey, we are met
   by a question of special theistic interest, in regard to the display of
   mind in certain of the lower animals. We do not here, indeed, propose
   to meddle with the general question of animal mind, which presents so
   many apparently insuperable difficulties; but that peculiar
   manifestation of intelligence, in many of the lower creation, which has
   received the name of "Instinct," and which has been supposed to bear
   with a very conclusive effect upon our subject, demands from us a
   passing notice.

   The cell-making of the bee, and the nest-building of the bird, are
   familiar examples of instinct. The mental power, displayed by the
   animal in these operations, appears to be wholly singular. In ordinary
   cases, mind works only according to instruction and experience: it is
   dependent on education, and increases with exercise. In these and other
   similar cases it operates, in the language of Paley, "prior to
   experience, and independent of instruction." Nor is this all. The
   definition of Paley--broadly as it demarcates the mode of instinct from
   that of mind in the ordinary sense--is considered by Lord Brougham to
   fail in expressing the most essential element of distinction between
   the two; viz., the conscious intention or foresight which is ever
   present in the one case in any effort of higher constructiveness, but
   which, in many cases of instinct, it seems wholly impossible to
   conceive present. The bee or the bird, for example, not only works
   towards the most beautiful results--builds the one its cell, and the
   other its nest--with a skill and precision which human effort only
   approaches at a distance,--neither of them having ever seen a cell or a
   nest before, or having ever previously tried to make one; but, in many
   cases, there seems also, as the most wonderful fact of all, the certain
   absence of any foresight of the end towards which all this animal
   ingenuity is expended. In the case of the bee, as his lordship has well
   put it in his discussion with Lord Althorpe, in the first of his
   dialogues, "I see her doing certain things which are manifestly to
   produce an effect she can know nothing about--or example, making a
   cell, and furnishing it with carpets and with liquid, fit to hold and
   to cherish safely a tender grub, and knowing nothing, of course, about
   grubs, or that any grub is ever to come, or that any such use, perhaps
   any use at all, is ever to be made of the work she is about. Indeed, I
   see another insect--the solitary wasp--bring a given number of small
   grubs, and deposit them in a hole which she has made over her egg, just
   grubs enough to maintain the worm that egg will produce when
   hatched--and yet this wasp never saw an egg produce a worm--nor ever
   saw a worm--nay, is to be dead long before the worm can be in
   existence; and, moreover, she never has in any way tasted or used these
   grubs, or used the hole she made, except for the prospective benefit of
   the unknown worm she is never to see. In all these cases, then, the
   animal works positively without knowledge, and in the dark. She also
   works without designing anything, and yet she works to a certain
   defined and important purpose." [108]

   It is, of course, impossible to pronounce so decidedly as to the
   absence of design, on the part of the animal, towards the end for which
   she is working, as it is to pronounce regarding her want of
   instruction. We have no means of absolutely determining the relation of
   the animal's consciousness to her work; whereas it is easy to
   ascertain, and is beyond all dispute, that she has never learned her
   art from others. She is as perfect at it at the first as at the last;
   and every bee, and every succeeding race of bees, works exactly in the
   same manner, and with the same exact degree of perfection--all which
   plainly declares the endowment to be of a specific character, distinct
   from ordinary intelligence. There is, however, as in the cases
   described, and certain others, the strongest evidence for concluding in
   the animal ignorance of intention towards the special end for which she
   works. If we did the same things, we know we should be planning in
   ignorance. And even those who have endeavoured most earnestly to reduce
   the operations of instinct to the category of ordinary intelligence,
   have been found to acknowledge such an absence of foresight in the
   animal in cases where the most refined and difficult end is yet
   subserved. [109]

   It has been a favourite attempt, it is true, of certain naturalists to
   explain such examples of animal skill by the aid of simple sensations.
   The bee and the bird are supposed to proceed in their work under the
   guidance of certain corporeal feelings, which only reach their
   gratification in its accomplishment. But, granting this, which is very
   probable, it seems to go but a little way towards an explanation; for,
   while such sensations may account for the animal's impulse toward her
   work, and even her continuance in it, they can never surely account for
   her ability to perform it. They may prompt it, but it is inconceivable
   that they can execute it; and we find, accordingly, that the very
   writers who would reduce the whole process to a series of sensations,
   many of them purely hypothetical, are yet, in the very nature of the
   case, obliged to call in a "constructive head" and a "stroke of genius
   "to complete the work. No one, indeed, could desire a better exposure
   of the futility of all such attempts to account for instinct on the
   mere ground of sensation, than that which is furnished by the very
   character of these attempts, as described by the writers in question.
   The impression which they must make on every mind, which is less eager
   to support an hypothesis than to ascertain the truth, is in the highest
   degree unsatisfactory. The mystery, as explained, is only tenfold more
   mysterious, while the explanation itself is incumbered by an amount of
   hypothesis which renders it wholly valueless. [110]

   The sensational view of instinct has been fully discussed by Lord
   Brougham in his well-known Dialogues--his interlocutor urging, with
   great acuteness, all its supposed force of explanation. It is
   impossible not to feel that it receives a very thorough and candid
   examination, and that it is rightly pronounced completely wanting at
   once in its arbitrariness, and in its failure, even if its
   arbitrariness were overlooked, to compass the most essential conditions
   of the problem. His lordship has shown this with great minuteness, and
   with the most undeniable success in the special case of the bee; and we
   cannot do better than refer any of our readers, who would more fully
   investigate the subject, to his interesting volume. It seems to us,
   upon the whole, that we are clearly warranted in asserting the
   operations of instinct to be often unconscious in reference to the end
   which they specially accomplish. Nay, it seems to be, as Lord Brougham
   contends, that it is this element of blind instrumentality in the
   production of a highly-wrought intellectual result that we specifically
   mean by instinct. It is the disproportion and inadequacy of the
   apparent means to the end which constitutes the marvel, and has so
   fixed curiosity upon it.

   Let us see, then, what is the bearing of this upon our subject. In such
   instinctive operations, we have the presence of a very high degree of
   intelligence. The important question arises, whose intelligence? The
   whole result of our examination of the facts has been to show that it
   is not, in any common sense, the intelligence of the animal that is
   here at work. There are some of the facts, as the rare mathematical
   qualities of the bees' work, which imply a knowledge that man has only
   attained by the most difficult and gradual mental processes, [111] and
   these alone would seem, from the first, to preclude the idea of the
   directing intelligence being that of the animal. But the strongest
   evidence against such a supposition consists certainly in the peculiar
   character of the mental power which here appears; displaying itself at
   once in such full and exquisite perfection, and with such unerring
   success accomplishing ends, of which it is incredible to conceive any
   prevision in the animal. If we cannot, therefore, accredit the animal
   itself with either the rare skill or the conscious purpose manifested
   in the operations before us, are we not carried directly upward to the
   Divine intelligence working in and through the animal? The argument may
   perhaps be stated more explicitly thus: "We have here a mental process
   of a very high order; we must find a mental agent. Such an agent we do
   not find in the animal; it appears, on the contrary, from all evidence,
   to be a mere blind instrument. We are forced, therefore, to admit a
   higher agent. This agent can only be the Supreme Intelligence
   everywhere present in creation.

   The conclusion which is here expressed is well known to be that in
   which many of the highest and most competent minds have rested. It
   seems to have been that of Newton, if his words, as quoted by Lord
   Brougham, are not yet entirely explicit. [112] Pope, in his well-known
   lines, [113] and Addison, [114] although with less clearness, have
   expressed the same truth. His lordship, in his second Dialogue, argues
   it at great length, and with great force, so as to leave a strong
   impression in its favour on the mind of every candid reader, if he may
   yet feel some parts of the argument not very lucid or satisfactory.

   The conclusion is an important one for our subject. Even if we do not
   assign it any exclusive weight,--as, according to our whole view, it is
   not so much exclusive in its character as it has been commonly supposed
   to be,--it yet possesses an interesting force which claims recognition
   in our inductive ascent. All nature and all life reveal a present
   Deity. Their mystery is only intelligible in such a presence. But here,
   in this special mystery, we appear to see the special presence of
   Divine agency--the immediate operation of the Divine Mind.

   because of the eminent ability that marks it, entirely inconclusive as
   we conceive its reasoning to be.

   [111] The hexagonal character of the bees' cell, and the purpose
   thereby so admirably served of the utmost possible saving of space, are
   so well known that it is unnecessary to do more than allude to them.
   This peculiar property of the hexagon was only ascertained by man in
   the progress of mathematical discovery. It is particularly deserving of
   notice, that certain doubts which had been cast upon the mathematical
   perfection of the bees' work have been completely dissipated by Lord
   Brougham, and much new and interesting light thus reflected on its
   highly intellectual character. From the analysis of a young
   mathematician of the name of Koenig, a pupil of Bernoulli, a
   discrepancy of two minutes was supposed to be found between the
   measurement of Maraldi of the actual angles of the cell, and that of
   the angles that made the greatest saving of wax. His lordship, however,
   by solving the problem in another way, found that the bee was right,
   and the analyst wrong; and other mathematicians corroborate him in this
   result. In another respect also, as to the saving of the wax in
   relation to the dimensions of the cell, which had been disputed by a
   Berlin academician, he vindicates the bee triumphantly against her
   critic.

§ II.--CHAPTER XII.

  COGNITIVE STRUCTURE IN MAN.

   IN entering upon the subject of this chapter, it is perhaps especially
   necessary for us to disclaim any pretension of treating the subject by
   itself. Here, as throughout in these chapters, our object is only to
   exhibit the bearing of the facts with which we deal upon the
   illustration of the Divine perfections. To a scientific investigation
   of the facts by themselves it would be wholly absurd in us to pretend.
   We take them, for the most part, simply as they are presented to us by
   the labours of others, who have cultivated the respective sciences to
   which they relate. It is enough for us that they are recognised as
   facts, although in some cases they may admit of a higher scientific
   explanation than that which we give of them. Our only concern is to set
   forth their theistic meaning, neither mistaking, nor, if possible,
   exaggerating aught.

   In regard to the facts treated of in this and the succeeding chapter,
   we can scarcely hope to be even so far successful. The pregnant
   interest of the facts, in our point of view, irresistibly prompted a
   survey of them; yet their subtlety, and the dire polemic which
   everywhere encompasses them, render such a mere summary survey as was
   at all compatible with our purpose peculiarly difficult. This, however,
   is to be kept in mind, that even where our statement and explanation of
   the fact may not be accepted, the theistic conclusion which we draw
   will, for the most part, remain untouched.

   There is no fact more difficult than that which meets us on the
   threshold of the sphere of cognition, and constitutes its condition.
   Perception is, in truth, the eternal problem of philosophy, from the
   special solution of which systems take their divergent course after an
   obvious and consistent manner, passing on the one extreme to
   materialism, on the other to idealism.

   Sensation in its lowest forms we formerly found to give, as its
   essential condition, a sentient self or subjective. Perception, in
   every case, gives not only a self, but also in correlation a not-self,
   an objective. The former draws and contains the field of apprehension
   within, the latter shuts it out from the sphere of self; no contrast or
   distinction being given in the former, distinction and contrast
   (apprehension of relation) being the characteristic of the latter.
   [115] Only in this apprehension, "not merely of a fact, but of
   relations," can cognition be properly said to begin. It is no longer
   simply consciousness, but consciousness expressing itself in an
   attitude of distinction from objective phenomena, the ego realising
   itself against the non-ego, and thereby becoming a centre of knowledge.

   But what more specially makes the contents of this fact of perception,
   or initial moment of cognition? This is the metaphysical life question,
   ceaseless in its stir. The old controversies die away, but from their
   ashes there spring up only higher and intenser forms of the problem.
   [116] Meanwhile, in its secret depths the fact evermore is born, and
   goes forth an intelligible presence into the world of reality, however
   we may explain or give an account of it.

   On any admissible explanation, we have in perception, according to what
   we have already stated, self and not-self, the ego and non-ego, in
   clear distinction, and yet in indissoluble relation. The correlation is
   in the perceptive act inseparable, while its factors are
   distinguishable. The one stands face to face with the other, and
   equally with the other attests itself. The reality in cognition is,
   therefore, ever twofold--subject and object; and in this twofold
   reality we have for the first time the full manifestation of
   mind--self-consciousness not merely gazing outward upon the objective
   world (as in the brute), but realising itself as distinct from and
   above the world.

   And viewed in reference to our subject, what a marvellous reality is
   this! With what fresh emphasis does it enunciate the inexhaustible
   energy of the great creative Source! What a new and beautiful utterance
   of Divine wisdom is it!--its very "image" deposited within the
   conditions of time and space! What a field of display for the Divine
   goodness does it open up! We cannot conceive it doubted that the fact
   of perception is thus validly pregnant with theistic significance. If,
   in the various organs of sense, the exquisite complicacy and delicacy
   of the nervous system, we recognise the clear manifestation of creative
   design, no less surely must we recognise it in the wonderful mental
   capacity to which these minister. For it is only in the exercise of the
   mind in perception that all the sensitive apparatus finds its highest
   purpose and fulfilment. All the marvel of its intricate and beautiful
   mechanism is only, in the last respect, for mind's service. In
   perception the mind appropriates and adjusts every lower organ and
   function for its own nobler spiritual uses. Surely, therefore, we must
   here recognise a farther token of creative presence and skill.

   The subjective and objective being brought face to face in perception,
   a continued mental activity is the result. The mind is continually
   taking in impressions through the avenue of the senses. It is obvious,
   however, that without some further attribute, this mental activity
   would have little availed. Incessantly as it was quickened it would
   have expired--the old impressions yielding to new ones ever presenting
   themselves. Knowledge, in any true sense, would thus have been
   impossible. Whatever might have been the liveliness or the range of
   perception, the mind could never have been truly cognitive without a
   power of acquisition.

   In the human mind a preservative power seems to emerge consentaneously
   with the presentative in perception. The mind not only perceives, but
   retains. This is one of the elements of the complex faculty which
   philosophers generally have denominated memory, the other element being
   specifically known as recollection. [117] There seems, however, good
   reason for confining the appellation of memory to the simple power of
   retention, which undoubtedly must be considered an original aptitude of
   the mind, irresolvable into any other. The power of recalling the
   preserved impressions seems, on the other hand, rightly held to be only
   a modified exercise of the suggestive or reproductive faculty, which
   next falls under our notice. This is well known as the view of Dr
   Thomas Brown, in the establishment of which he considered he had
   destroyed all the claims of memory to be regarded as an original
   faculty of mind. But that his subtlety was so far at fault, is evident
   from the simple fact that, apart from the mind's capacity of retention,
   of which he takes no account, the suggestive or associative faculty
   would have no material whereon to operate.

   The best claim of this power of retention to be reckoned an original
   element of mind is seen in its primary and fundamental importance.
   Apart from it, mind might have been a continued, but it would
   necessarily have been an aimless and futile activity. Consciousness
   would have been incessantly born only to expire--a mere series of
   intense bewilderment. But a simple power of retention was not all that
   was necessary. It required to be, for the purposes of knowledge, the
   very kind of retention which we actually possess; the power, for
   example, not only of preserving impressions, but of preserving them
   beyond the immediate sphere of consciousness--storing them away, as it
   were, within a secret repository, whence they can with more or less
   facility be drawn by the operation of the suggestive faculty. This is a
   very important feature of memory which has been too little noticed. It
   is obviously the condition at once of order and repose among our ideas.
   Otherwise, with even an inconceivably higher range of attention than we
   now possess, we must have been utterly oppressed by the commingling and
   hurrying crowd of our perceptions. They would have been ever in
   presence, so many petitioners, incessantly and with equal eagerness
   soliciting our regard, and overwhelming us with their anxious suit.
   Consciousness must have sunk under its intolerable burden. It would
   have been no longer, indeed, a brief ever-vanishing impulse, but a too
   vivid agony. The mental energy must have perished under the thronging
   rush of its recipients, like the maid of Roman story under the shields
   of the invaders admitted into her fortress. [118] What a truly
   admirable provision, therefore, is this power of retention! In
   describing it, we have necessarily set forth at the same time its
   useful and beneficent character.

   We cannot pass away from it without noticing shortly its dependence
   upon attention, and the interesting use and value of this mental
   capacity--which is not yet to be reckoned, as it has sometimes been, a
   separate faculty, so much as the mere attitude or energy of the soul in
   every other faculty. Even in sensation, which most of all might be
   supposed independent of attention, we found that a distinct act of it
   was put forth. This mental attitude is, however, especially related to
   the faculty of retention, conditioning it to such a degree as to be apt
   even to be confounded with it. This dependence of memory upon attention
   has been noticed by all our philosophical writers. [119] Our degree of
   retention seems, in fact, to be exactly proportioned to our degree of
   attention. The more intense the attitude of the mind towards any object
   in the first place, the more fixed the impression retained of it. And
   thus it is we readily account for the strong and ineradicable
   impressions made by those objects which have interested the passions
   and drawn forth the whole soul.

   The importance and value of this mental capacity are abundantly
   obvious. It may be said to underlie our whole mental being, as the
   condition of its culture and progress, imparting to it that
   ever-quickening spur which carries it onwards to new triumphs, and, to
   a large extent, those varying measures of development which it
   manifests in different individuals. All science is its product; and
   life owes to it all its interest and joy. It is, alone, its incessant
   operation from infancy--filling the storehouse of memory with the
   familiar images of parents and brothers and sisters--which binds
   together family ties, and strengthens all family love. [120]

   The mind having apprehended in perception and laid up in memory the
   objects of knowledge, it was obviously necessary that it should possess
   a power of recalling or reproducing these objects, in order that its
   knowledge should be serviceable to it. Stored away irrevocably beyond
   the sphere of consciousness, they had as well never have been laid up.
   We have seen how requisite a provision it is that they should lie
   beyond this sphere, in order to leave the mind at liberty to occupy
   itself with other objects continuing to solicit it; but it is clear
   that if thus for ever laid away, our stores of perception could never
   have become to us stores of experience, and mere accumulation never
   have quickened into living knowledge. We have, therefore, the power of
   recalling our past impressions. This we are enabled to do in virtue of
   that great principle of our mental constitution familiarly known as the
   association of ideas, but more correctly expressed as our suggestive or
   reproductive faculty. There is none of our mental faculties which has
   in later times engaged more study than this--none which has at all
   times excited more marvel, and prompted more curious inquiry.

   The process of reproduction takes place according to laws which have
   been variously enumerated and described, and the honour of first
   generalising which has been sometimes attributed to one or other of our
   modern philosophers--to Hobbes, Locke, and Hume. Sir W. Hamilton, [121]
   however, has recently claimed this honour for Aristotle, whose
   generalisation is not only first in time, but also, in his view, the
   most correct and comprehensive. These laws are generally reckoned at
   least four in number,--viz., the law of similarity, the law of contrast
   or correlation, the law of co-adjacency (contiguity in time and place),
   and what Sir William Hamilton has called under protest, the law of
   preference, meant to include Brown's secondary laws of suggestion.
   Under the operation of one or other of these laws our mental activity
   proceeds, and all our mental experience is accumulated. Through them
   order is introduced into what would otherwise be the mere chaos of
   mental succession, and the way, as it were, is cleared for the
   emergence of those higher activities which carry forward our
   intellectual development. Each mind receives its peculiar tone, and
   enters upon its peculiar education, under their influence.

   Putting out of view the fourth of these laws, which is obviously
   distinct, and not indeed properly expressive of a principle of mental
   succession, but only of a determining accident of it, [122] it seems
   possible to reduce the other three to one fundamental law or principle,
   which may be defined as that whereby the mind, in all its efforts,
   completes a circle of thought--in other words, brings a whole into all
   its representations. The special laws mentioned seem all capable of
   being regarded as merely particular modes of the operation of this one
   great law of integration. If we suppose, as an example of the first,
   the case of one face, from some point of likeness in it, suggesting
   another, let us see what is the mental process which takes place. The
   mind, on apprehending the particular point of resemblance in the face
   before it, immediately begins to complete the image thereby recalled.
   It feels that it has got a part of a whole formerly familiar to it, and
   its immediate aim is to bring into view that whole. In ordinary
   instances the image completes itself instantaneously, and we are not
   therefore conscious of any such aim; but, in some instances, it is only
   after frequent efforts that it does so (as when we see a face
   resembling some one that we cannot yet recall), and then we become
   distinctly conscious of the reproductive operation. The eye, or mouth,
   or whatever part of the strange face is recognised as familiar, is
   fixed upon by the mind, and becomes the centre of a representative
   picture which the mind has no satisfaction till it has completed. In
   the case of the law of contrast, as when night suggests day, good evil,
   a dwarf a giant, the mental process is still more obviously of this
   integrating character. [123] For, in fact, the one mental conception
   here directly involves the other, and is only fully intelligible in
   relation to it. Each idea is to us only what it is, on account of its
   opposite. In passing from the one to the other, therefore, the mind is
   simply completing the complex image, one side of which is always the
   necessary correlate of the other. The same seems to hold equally true
   of the law of co-adjacency, as when a certain house recalls the friends
   we met--the conversation we had in it; or when one event recalls
   another which happened at the same time. In both cases the mental
   process obviously consists in the completion from a fragmentary of a
   total representation, previously laid up in the storehouse of memory.

   When the train of association is once started (the integrating process
   once begun), it proceeds throughout in the same way. Every successive
   representation called up, still surrounds itself with another as part
   of a further whole. It is often the very slightest bond--so slight as
   to escape, at the moment, detection--that unites the successive
   evolutions of the mental panorama. In one mind, moreover, association
   will take place by deeper and more remote, in another, by more common
   and palpable, analogies. Mental refinement is really nothing else than
   the facile play of association round the more subtle and recondite
   characteristics of things--their more hidden and beautiful relations.
   It is simply the exquisite edge imparted by discipline to the
   reproductive faculty.

   In speaking thus of the process of reproduction as throughout of an
   integrating character, it may be necessary to guard against our being
   supposed to say that the mind necessarily impresses a whole upon all
   the successive train of its ideas. This, on the contrary, we know it
   frequently does not do, the last link in the train having often no
   relation to the first as parts of a common whole. Mental succession is
   not unfrequently, as in reverie, a mere straggling array of scattered
   images. The integration does not proceed, as it is not necessary that
   it should, all along its course, but only from step to step. The
   general train may thus present a very incongruous mixture of ideas,
   while it has yet, at every step, strictly obeyed the great law of
   mental development. We may further observe that it is not necessary, as
   we might be apt to think from a first confused conception of the law,
   that the facts of a train of association should have previously
   coexisted in the mind. In some cases they have coexisted, and to this
   fact of their coexistence is owing their tendency to reproduce one
   another; but more frequently they have had no such previous alliance in
   the mind. An object never before perceived may suggest an old familiar
   object; while, again, an object frequently perceived, may suggest, in
   different moments, very different and even quite new trains of thought.
   Were it not for this characteristic of the principle of association,
   the field of our knowledge would have been comparalively narrow,
   confined as it must have been to the relations which, from actual
   observation, we had stored up in our minds. We would never have been
   able to get out of the past wheel or circle of our thoughts. As it is,
   the suggestive capacity, continually started by everything around us,
   is in all active and cultivated minds ever entering on fresh fields of
   intellectual interest, and acquiring fresh stores of knowledge.

   Altogether, there is, perhaps, no part of our intellectual condition of
   which the beneficial use and beauty are more conspicuous. Apart from
   it, life could have possessed no individual interest; and the continual
   flow of consciousness could never have become concentrated and
   quickened into special cultivation and happiness. In the language of Dr
   Thomas Brown, "It is the suggesting principle, the reviver of thoughts
   and feelings which have passed away, that gives value to all our other
   powers and susceptibilities, intellectual and moral,--not, indeed, by
   producing them, for, though unevolved, they would still, as latent
   capacities, be a part of the original constitution of our spiritual
   nature--but by rousing them into action, and furnishing them with those
   accumulating and inexhaustible materials which are to be the elements
   of future thought, and the objects of future emotion. Every talent by
   which we excel, and every vivid feeling which animates us, derive their
   energy from the suggestions of this ever-active principle. We love and
   hate; we desire and fear; we use means for obtaining good and avoiding
   evil, because we remember the objects and occurrences which we have
   formerly observed, and because the future, in the similarity of the
   successions which it presents, appears to us only a prolongation of the
   past.

   "In conferring on us the capacity of these spontaneous suggestions,
   then, Heaven has much more than doubled our existence; for without it,
   and consequently without those faculties and emotions which involve it,
   existence would scarcely have been desirable. The very importance of
   the benefits which we derive from it, however, renders us, perhaps,
   less sensible of its value; since it is so mingled with all our
   knowledge, and all our plans of action, that we find it difficult to
   conceive a state of sentient being of which it is not a part, and to
   estimate, consequently, at a just amount the advantage which it
   affords. The future memory of perception seems to us almost implied in
   perception itself; and to speculate on that strange state of existence
   which would have been the condition of man if he had been formed
   without the power of remembrance, and capable only of a series of
   sensations, has at first an appearance almost of absurdity and
   contradiction, as if we were imagining conditions which were in their
   nature incompatible. Yet, assuredly, if it were possible for us to
   consider such a subject a priori, the real cause of wonder would appear
   to be, not in the absence of the suggestions of memory, as in the case
   imagined, but in that remembrance of which we have the happy
   experience. When a feeling of the existence, of which consciousness
   furnishes the only evidence, has passed away so completely that not
   even the slightest consciousness of it remains, it would surely, but
   for that experience, be more natural to suppose that it had perished
   altogether, than that it should, at the distance of many years, without
   any renewal of it by the external cause which originally produced it,
   again start, as it were of itself, into being. To foresee that which
   has not yet begun to exist, is in itself scarcely more unaccountable
   than to see as it were before us what has wholly ceased to exist. The
   present moment is all of which we are conscious, and which can strictly
   be said to have a real existence, in relation to ourselves. That mode
   of time which we call the past, and that other mode of time which we
   call the future, are both equally unexisting. That the knowledge of
   either should be added to us, so as to form a part of our present
   consciousness, is a gift of Heaven, most beneficial to us, indeed, but
   most mysterious, and equally, or nearly equally, mysterious, whether
   the unexisting time of which the knowledge is indulged to us be the
   future or the past." [124]

   Nor is the Divine wisdom and benevolence alone manifest in the simple
   power bestowed upon us of reproducing our former thoughts and feelings,
   but especially in the actual mode of their reproduction, according to
   certain definite laws. This definiteness in the procedure of the
   suggestive faculty is the sole condition of our being able to apply our
   experience, and to make continued progress in the pursuit of knowledge.
   It alone enables us to devise plans of acquisition, and to calculate
   upon the results of education. Without it, we might have enjoyed, in
   the power of reproduction, a variety of feeling, but it could have been
   of no use either for our happiness or our cultivation. "He who has
   given us, in one simple principle, the power of reviving the past, has
   not made His gift so unavailing. The feelings which this wonderful
   principle preserves and restores, arise, not loosely and confusedly,
   but according to general laws or tendencies of succession, contrived
   with the most admirable adaptation to our wants, so as to bring again
   before us the knowledge formerly acquired by us, at the very time when
   it is most profitable that it should return. A value is thus given to
   experience, which otherwise would not be worthy of the name; and we are
   enabled to extend it almost at pleasure, so as to profit, not merely by
   that experience which the events of nature, occurring in conformity
   with these general laws, must at any rate have afforded to us, but to
   regulate this very experience itself, to dispose objects and events so
   that, by tendencies of suggestion on the firmness of which we may put
   perfect reliance, they shall give us, perhaps at the distance of many
   years, such lessons as we may wish them to yield, and thus to invent
   and create, in a great measure, the intellectual and moral history of
   our future life, as an epic or dramatic writer arranges at his will the
   continued scenes of his various and magnificent narrative." [125]

   In our analysis of the cognitive structure in man we have now reached
   an important stage. We have marked the great facts of perception,
   memory, and suggestion, in their respective bearings on our subject. In
   the first, we have seen the mind presentative or intuitive (the subject
   standing face to face with the objective reality in perception), in the
   second, retentive, in the third, representative. It is desirable to
   notice the peculiar advance of the mental capacity in this third stage.
   It is no longer the immediate facts of nature with which it deals. It
   is no longer directly conversant with the objective realities
   everywhere obtruded upon it, but with its own reconstructions of these
   realities. It is not the thing itself any more which the mind has
   before it, but an image or representation of it. It has, as it were,
   freed itself from the presence of the outward world, and begun to
   construct for itself a new world of ideas. Here, therefore, it enters
   into a far higher sphere of activity than before.

   From this point of advance the intellectual energy rapidly develops
   into those various forms which have been sometimes treated as so many
   separate faculties. In all of them there is simply displayed, in a
   variety of modes and applications, the power of representation, or of
   forming ideas. It will only be necessary for us to indicate the two
   main directions which the mind assumes in these its higher productive
   stages. These are, the understanding and the imagination.

   The mind having, in the process of reproduction, attained a series of
   images or ideas of its past objects of perception, immediately begins
   to bring these ideas into relation to one another. This it does in
   different ways; by fixing, for example, upon points of resemblance
   among its ideas, and out of these resemblances constituting a new
   general idea,--as when, from several representations of individual men,
   we attain to the general idea of man--a process well known as
   generalisation; or, again, by separating from different objects held in
   contemplation some specific quality, and making of it a new idea,--as
   when we recognise different objects as white or cold, &c., the common
   property of whiteness or coldness being constituted into a separate
   idea--a process equally well known as abstraction. The mental act here,
   it is obvious, is not simply reproductive, but specially productive. In
   the exercise of association the mind has already left behind the actual
   objective world, to concern itself with its own ideas, or
   reconstruction of that world. But these ideas yet directly represent
   the original realities: the one looks back to the other. Here, however,
   in the processes of generalisation and abstraction, the mind no longer
   looks beyond its own forms or notions. Its ideas, from being mere
   representations of past objects of perception, become, irrespective of
   all reference to such objects, fixed mental possessions, which we
   contemplate by themselves, and by which we carry on trains of
   reasoning.

   It is necessary to state, however, that an indispensable preliminary to
   this advance of intelligence is the power of language,--a power which
   even emerges on the lower sphere of simple representation, and is
   requisite to its development to any extent. Without such a power, the
   mind might construct representations of the objects of its past
   experience, as is clearly done by the lower animals, but it could not
   hold them before it freely when separated from experience. It could not
   freely entertain and make use of its ideas without a power of embodying
   them in signs. [126] And especially it could not, apart from signs,
   begin that process of comparison among its ideas which constitutes the
   special function of the understanding. It is only when the mind has,
   through the aid of language, fixed its representations, and given them,
   so to speak, a new objectivity within its own realm, that it can deal
   with them entirely by themselves, and, apart altogether from the
   outward world, carry on that higher course of activity which we
   peculiarly denominate thought.

   The parallel range of mental activity, which we have named imagination,
   is one in which the mind is still more eminently productive. The term
   imagination, we are aware, is often applied to a lower degree of mental
   power; but we think that it is far more appropriately confined to that
   higher energy which, while dealing directly with sensible images, and
   so far standing on a lower intellectual platform than the
   understanding, yet even, in its ordinary flights, carries with it often
   all the special activities of the understanding--abstracting and
   generalising and classifying its appropriate objects, as it weaves them
   into new forms of interest or beauty. [127] It is this formative or
   creative element, certainly, which is the constitutive one of
   imagination in the highest sense. It may not inaptly be considered to
   be the mental energy in its greatest heat of productivity; not merely,
   as in argumentation, constructing within the province of the abstract,
   building up some linked structure of sequential beauty; but
   constructing within the province of the possible, and building up some
   "sunny dome," outmatching the most subtle combinations of the
   understanding. It is impossible for any to attend for a moment to the
   simplest exercise of imagination, as it transacts itself even in those
   day-dreams which almost all have, without perceiving that the main
   element of the exercise is thus creative. The imaginative process is
   also an intensely vivid one; but it is not, as some have thought, its
   vivacity which pre-eminently distinguishes it from other phases of
   mental representation. This is merely the gleam which the mental wheel
   emits in its glowing activity--the flash of the intensely-quickened
   formative process. But it is the formative element itself, and not its
   attendant light, which constitutes imagination. It is the gift of
   creation which makes the painter and the poet,--the workmen of the
   imagination. The vivacity is merely the bright accompaniment of the
   gift.

   There is thus a striking alliance, and an equally striking diversity,
   between the mental powers of ratiocination and imagination. The one
   gives us science, the other art. The one is the organ of discovery, the
   other of inventiveness, in the noblest sense. The one deals with
   notions (concepts), the other with images (pictures), conveyed through
   the medium of the senses. From the intimate connection of imagination
   with the senses, making them, as it does, directly tributary in its
   highest workings--whereas the mind, in reasoning, ranges only among its
   pure ideas--the former might be supposed to be the lower faculty. Yet,
   from the spiritual regions into which imagination can carry its
   flights, it undoubtedly asserts for itself the loftier place and
   dignity in the end. It enters into the infinite, which is throughout a
   forbidden sphere to the understanding; and, mediating between the
   appropriate inspirations of spirit and of sense, the minister of both,
   it only reaches its true glory when clothing the lower intuitions in
   the celestial garment of the higher.

   In reverting, in conclusion, to their specific bearing on our subject,
   how powerfully do both these forms of mental energy express the Divine
   wisdom and benevolence! how directly do they speak of an infinite
   source of mental fulness and strength! That high power of reflective
   investigation which has constructed the vast and ever-expanding edifice
   of human science, and searches with so penetrating an insight and so
   powerful a range the heavens and the earth, to make them tributary to
   its purpose; and that still more marvellous capacity, a delegated
   creator within its sphere, which has wrought such exquisite
   combinations of poetry and of art, accumulating treasures of wisdom and
   of beauty to our race--surely these bespeak a Master Mind, whose image
   they are, and whose beneficent glory they reflect.

   [116] This question has again arisen in the sphere of our British
   philosophy, under the handling of one of the most finely speculative
   minds that ever entered this field of high debate. In Professor
   Ferrier's Institutes of Metaphysic the latest doctrine of psychology,
   which had gained such general acceptance, has been set aside as not
   only incomplete, but vicious as a basis of speculation. With Mr
   Ferrier's special doctrine it would be out of place here to meddle. We
   have no doubt, however, that the subtlety and depth of metaphysical
   genius which his work betrays, its rare display of rigorous and
   consistent reasoning, and the inimitable precision and beauty of its
   style on almost every page, must secure for it a distinguished place in
   the history of philosophical discussion.

   [117] "This faculty," says Dugald Stewart, who presents a very clear
   and thorough analysis of it according to its twofold conception,
   "implies two things--a capacity of retaining knowledge, and a power of
   recalling it to our thoughts when we have occasion to apply it to use.
   The word memory is sometimes employed to express the capacity, and
   sometimes the power."--Philosophy of the Human Mind, vol. i. p. 404.

   [118] This comparison, which seemed to us as sufficiently fitting, is
   not our own, but to whom it belongs we cannot exactly say. It is
   willingly conceded to any one who puts in a valid claim for it.

   [120] Although we had the capacity of retaining knowledge, if this
   capacity were not, as it is, in proportion to attention, one impression
   would have been as good and effectual as a thousand, and all family
   union and recognition would thus have been impossible. Any face would
   have been just as distinguishable, or rather as indistinguishable, to a
   child, as the faces of its parents.

   [122] It expresses the relation not between mental phenomena in
   themselves, but between the individual mind and any series of such
   phenomena. It is a determining accident of association, therefore,
   rather than an inherent principle or law of it.

   [123] Sir W. Hamilton calls this law specially the law of relativity or
   integration.--Vide Appendix to Reid's Works, Note D, p. 911.

   [126] See MORELL'S Elements of Psychology, p. 183-184, in which the
   peculiar functions of what he calls the sematic power are exhibited
   with great clearness, and to which the writer has, in these few
   paragraphs on the understanding, been considerably indebted.

   [127] This would seem to imply that the imagination can only be rightly
   treated after the logical faculty whose special process it presupposes.
   And this we apprehend to be the truth. Mr Morell, in his recent
   work--admirable in many respects--has not, according to our view,
   sufficiently distinguished imagination. The term is applied by him to
   two mental processes, the lower of which appears to be simply
   equivalent to what Stewart called conception, or the power we possess
   of holding our ideas before us, separated from all immediate reference
   to place or time; and the higher (which he calls productive or creative
   imagination) is with him apparently nothing else than the general
   process whereby the mind associates its ideas. This confusion of
   imagination with the general power of association is, it appears to us,
   quite mistaken. For the process of the recovery of our ideas,
   transacted under the guide of the laws of association, does not
   necessarily involve a special creative element. The mind may, in this
   process, be simply recollective, although, no doubt, it often also is
   eminently productive. Association may in any case, therefore, readily
   pass into imagination. Yet in all cases imagination is something
   specific and superior; rightly ranking even above the understanding,
   because carrying up the processes of the latter into all its more
   characteristic and important exercises.

§ II.--CHAPTER XIII.

  EMOTIVE STRUCTURE IN MAN.

   WE pass finally, in this section of evidence, to a brief consideration
   of the emotive sphere of our nature, which is very rich in results for
   our purpose. It is its emotional capacity which imparts to human life
   all its peculiar and ever-freshening interest. It may be possible to
   conceive a being made capable of intellectual without emotional
   activity. "We might, perhaps," says Dr Thomas Brown, "have been so
   constituted with respect to our intellectual states of mind, as to have
   had all the varieties of these, our remembrances, judgments, and
   creations of fancy, without one emotion. But without the emotions which
   accompany them, of how little value would the mere intellectual
   functions have been! It is to our vivid feelings of this class we must
   look for those tender regards which make our remembrances sacred--for
   that love of truth and glory and mankind, without which, to animate and
   reward us in our discovery and diffusion of knowledge, the continued
   exercise of judgment would be a fatigue rather than a satisfaction; and
   for all that delightful wonder which we feel, when we contemplate the
   admirable creations of fancy, or the still more admirable beauties of
   their unfading model--that model which is ever before us, and the
   imitation of which, as it has been truly said, is the only imitation
   that is itself originality. By our other mental functions we are mere
   spectators of the machinery of the universe, living and inanimate; by
   our emotions we are admirers of nature, lovers of men, adorers of God.
   The earth, without them, would be only a field of colours, inhabited by
   beings who may contribute, indeed, more permanently to our means of
   physical comfort than any one of the inanimate forms which we behold;
   but who, beyond the moment in which they are capable of affecting us
   with pain or pleasure, would be only like the other forms and colours
   which would meet us wherever we turned our weary and restless eye; and
   God himself, the source of all good, and the object of all worship,
   would be only the Being by whom the world was made." [128]

   The truth is, that while it may be possible for us to imagine
   intellectual life apart from emotional, we cannot imagine any
   development of the one without the other; for the advancement of
   knowledge and of civilisation, if the direct product of our
   intellectual, is no less truly the indirect product of our emotional
   nature, the one being called into activity all along its course only by
   the other. All the progressive springs of humanity take their rise in
   our emotional being. In virtue of it alone do we own the spur of a
   happiness which is never satisfied, and of a glory which is still
   distant. In the very fact, therefore, of our combined emotive and
   cognitive activity, we are bound to recognise the wisdom and goodness
   of the Creator. How blank and unbeneficent would life have been as a
   mere round of passionless intellectuality! Where would have been all
   that now makes its charm, and renders it, amid the gathering darkness
   of death, still dear? Where would have been all the most exquisite
   products of literature and of art, without passion to portray or
   interest to kindle? And we must surely, then, acknowledge the
   beneficence of the Hand which has clothed life with all those soft and
   tender attributes--that garment of ever-varying emotion which makes it
   truly life. Here, indeed, we shall find the most abundant traces of the
   Divine goodness.

   We do not attempt any systematic analysis, far less any exhaustive
   classification, of the emotions. Here, as everywhere, our purpose only
   requires, and our space can only afford, a general glance at the
   phenomena which crowd upon us.

   Among the lowest and most universal group of emotions seem to be those
   which serve to guard, and, so to speak, intrench life, of which Alarm
   on the negative side, and Anger [129] on the positive, may be
   considered the generic expressions. [130] Throughout the whole course
   of animal life these emotions are found deeply implanted. In the
   feeblest animal forms, alarm is seen manifesting itself on the approach
   or the contact of any unknown object. And as we rise in the scale of
   being to man himself, the motive becomes, indeed, less obtrusive in its
   modes of operation, more refined and disguised in its character, but
   not less really present and powerful. It lives a silent yet watchful
   sentinel in every human bosom, conservative not only of life, but of
   all that gives beauty and dignity and happiness to life. How vividly,
   for example, does it reign in the mother for the care of her offspring;
   in the householder for the care of his goods; in the citizen for the
   care of the commonwealth; in the maiden for the care of her virtue! It
   is everywhere the guardian of life and its treasures. Whenever life
   becomes intensified, fraught as with a deeper wealth and fulness of
   possession, there alarm, however undemonstrative, stands a more
   vigilant guardian. And did it not do so--were the soul not readily
   fluttered and put up when destruction threatened--what an invaded and
   desecrated thing would life soon become!

   The continuation of alarm--not merely the first movement or flutter of
   the soul, but the prolonged emphasis of the emotion--becomes
   fear,--apprehension,--inciting to escape from danger. The object of
   alarm, if not removed, has a constant tendency thus to pass into an
   object of fear. Terror, which sometimes stands for the generic emotion,
   seems certainly more correctly regarded as its highest excess,
   betokening the comparative feebleness of the subject of it. The danger
   is so imminent and threatening that the mere guardian impulse loses
   itself in that species of convulsive agitation which we specially
   denominate terror. Panic, again, is contagious alarm. The simple
   emotion has a tendency to propagate itself from heart to heart, and as
   it propagates, it kindles into intenser forms, till it becomes that
   general and helpless movement of fear which we call panic.

   Along with this class of emotions may be reckoned another class,
   different in character, yet also allied, as revealing something of the
   same cautionary character. Of this class, surprise and wonder may stand
   as specimens. These emotions we experience on the presentation of some
   new, striking, or unexpected object. We pause and are arrested, but do
   not, as in alarm, feel any impulse to retreat. Where the exciting cause
   is not novelty, or unexpectedness, but something great, unknown, and
   but dimly suggested, wonder becomes awe. These emotions are not, like
   the preceding, directly conservative, but they involve a conservative
   element; and it is remarkable that they all readily pass over into
   alarm, or some of its directly associate feelings. They all tend to
   drive the soul backward within itself; while yet, by a strange paradox,
   often marking (as all true and comprehensive observers know) the
   deepest facts of nature, they also tend to draw it forth and detain it
   before the exciting object. It is this balance of movement, the
   oscillation of backwards and forwards, of retreat and advance, which
   makes the pause so characteristic of these emotions.

   The great generic emotion of anger is perhaps even more actively
   conservative in its character than alarm; for it is positive, while the
   latter is only negative. It furnishes weapons of defence, while the
   other only instigates to flight. Dr Thomas Brown has described it very
   finely and eloquently under this point of view. So obviously is it the
   view under which it falls to be considered, that all which he says
   regarding it is little more than a representation of the beneficial
   ends which it thus subserves. "There is a principle in our mind," he
   says, "which is to us like a constant protector--which may slumber,
   indeed, but which slumbers only at seasons when its vigilance would be
   useless--which awakes, therefore, at the first appearance of unjust
   intention, and which becomes more watchful and more vigorous in
   proportion to the violence of the attack which it has to dread. What
   should we think of the providence of Nature, if, when aggression was
   threatened against the weak and unarmed at a distance from the aid of
   others, there were instantly and uniformly, by the intervention of some
   wonder-working power, to rush into the hand of the defenceless a sword,
   or other weapon of defence? And yet this would be but a feeble
   assistance, if compared with that which we receive from those simple
   emotions which Heaven has caused to rush, as it were, into our mind for
   repelling every attack. What would be a sword in the trembling hand of
   the infirm, of the aged, of him whose pusillanimous spirit shrinks at
   the very appearance, not of danger merely, but even of the arms by the
   use of which danger might be averted, and to whom, consequently, the
   very sword, which he scarcely knew how to grasp, would be an additional
   cause of terror, not an instrument of defence and safety? The instant
   anger which arises does more than many such weapons. It gives the
   spirit which knows how to make a weapon of everything, or which, of
   itself, does without a weapon what even a thunderbolt would be
   powerless to do in the shuddering grasp of the coward. When anger
   arises, fear is gone; there is no coward, for all are brave. Even
   bodily infirmity seems to yield to it, like the very infirmities of the
   mind. The old are, for the moment, young again; the weakest vigorous."
   [131]

   Resentment is the deepened and prolonged form of anger; and where the
   simple emotion might be impotent for the defence of invaded rights,
   this becomes a formidable guardian of them. Those who might brave the
   temporary heat of anger, would yet shrink from the sustained energy of
   resentment.

   Indignation, in the twofold import which it seems to bear, is simply a
   modification of anger. As an individual emotion, it may be defined to
   be anger restraining itself from a sense of the unworthiness of the
   object exciting it--as when we feel indignant at some affront offered
   us--a kind of magnanimous anger. But it seems to be most
   characteristically a social emotion--anger propagating itself in the
   social body, at the sight or the recital of some great wrong done. In
   such a case the common heart is stirred, and drawn forth in an attitude
   of resistance. The injury committed kindles a widespread feeling, which
   gathers strength as it passes from heart to heart, and finally flames
   forth in a glow of indignant opposition, before which the sternest
   injustice must tremble, and which is undoubtedly one of the strongest
   safeguards of social virtue and happiness. At the same time, as Dr
   Brown has acutely pointed out, there is an admirably benevolent
   provision in the working of this emotion, whereby it is prevented
   becoming that inconvenient and excessive sentiment--passing over into
   acts of injustice, perhaps worse than those against which it was
   directed--which it would be otherwise ever apt to become. It is only by
   some very flagrant wrong that it is powerfully excited, and, for the
   most part, it tends speedily to expend itself. Were it different--were
   members of the same community not only disposed to share in feelings of
   anger for each other's wrongs, but to experience such feelings with the
   same readiness, and in the same proportion, as the special sufferer,
   the consequences would be utterly destructive. There would then be no
   check to individual anger, which, propagating itself with an
   ever-kindling force, would swell to a mischievous and overbearing
   height. Indignation would no longer be a privilege, but an intolerable
   burden. "The zeal of the knight of La Mancha, who had many giants to
   vanquish, and many captive princesses to free, might leave him still
   some moments of peace; but if all the wrongs of all the injured were to
   be felt by us as our own, with the same ardent resentment and eagerness
   of revenge, our knight-errantry would be far more oppressive; and
   though we might kill a few moral giants, and free a few princesses, so
   many more would still remain, unslain and unfreed, that we should have
   little satisfaction even in our few successes. How admirably provident,
   then, is the Author of our nature, not merely in the emotions with the
   susceptibility of which He has endowed us, but in the very
   proportioning of these emotions so as to produce the greatest good at
   the least expense even of momentary suffering." [132]

   In ascending among the higher emotions, which no longer merely tend to
   conserve life, but to develop and advance it, we reach a region where
   the unceasing confluence of the phenomena seems almost to defy attempts
   at analysis and grouping. The simplest which present themselves are,
   perhaps, those of which the element of complacency or satisfaction may
   stand as the type. This element of emotion might have taken first rank
   in our enumeration, both on account of its comprehensiveness, and its
   being so directly suited to our purpose. It abounds in the lower
   animals, displaying itself in frequent playfulness and pervading
   happiness. In man, its range is very diversified, from the mere rude
   contentment which is half corporeal, to the cheerfulness which sheds a
   daily sunshine on the heart, the gladness which claps its hands, the
   delight which flashes with a quick and outbursting warmth, the most
   exalted joy, and the most spiritual rapture. It may be called the
   normal expression of the emotional power. It marks the tone which in
   health and security this power gives forth--just as pleasurableness, in
   the same case, is the proper expression of sensation. The natural
   condition of the one and of the other, when no invasion has taken place
   of the life which they manifest, is a feeling of enjoyment. This, as
   already observed, is a fact of the highest significance for our
   subject, speaking, in the most convincing language, of the goodness of
   the Creator of a life so fraught with happiness.

   It is true that here, as along the whole line of sensibility, there is
   an opposite side--a shadow tracing the brightness. There is a parallel
   group of emotions of an antagonistic character, at least as varied in
   their range as those of which we have been speaking--from the tempered
   vein of sadness, and the quick acuteness of regret, to the dark
   brooding of melancholy, the vehement flow of sorrow, the bitterness of
   anguish, and the agony of remorse. But--not to speak of the strange
   element of enjoyment which often lies concealed in some of these
   painful emotions, nor yet, just now, of their disciplinary virtue,
   often converting them into the highest good--we merely point here to
   the fact of their being, as on their very front they so obviously bear
   to be, invaders of the natural life of emotion. They emerge as elements
   of disorder and conflict, interfering with the free flow of emotional
   activity, and so present themselves, from the first, as difficulties
   requiring a higher calculus for solution than that which their own
   nature simply affords. This is undoubtedly the meaning which such
   phenomena of suffering bear to all who most thoughtfully contemplate
   human existence. They are recognised as out of the course of the Divine
   order, as seeming contradictions to it, but not, by any means, as per
   se destroying that order, and making it a nullity. They are recognised
   as anomalies needing explanation (further than what they contain in
   themselves), but not as absolute contrarieties entitled to negative the
   good, with which they appear at variance. To all who have gone beyond
   the mere surface of speculation, the good is felt, under whatever
   appearances to the contrary, to be the Divine order, of which the evil
   is an invasion. [133] The parallel existence of evil is not entitled to
   set aside the good, but only to arrest us in our full conclusions
   regarding it. It does not destroy our theodicy,--it only leaves it
   imperfect. The Divine meaning of nature, on the very lowest view, is
   not altogether doubtful and contradictory, but only incomplete.

   There is an important class of emotions which relate themselves by an
   intelligible process to those now considered. Conscious complacency, or
   the simple emotion turned back upon itself in contemplation--what we
   commonly call self-complacency--would seem to be their common basis.
   Such emotions as gladness, joy, rapture, are eminently distinguished
   for their unconscious character. They are all self-forgetting. The
   emotive capacity in them overflows round some other object; and the
   moment the overflow ceases, and returns upon itself, the pleasurable
   feeling so far disappears. Happiness shrinks from self-contemplation;
   and we may thus see the rationale of the reaction that often takes
   place in pleasurable emotion of an excessive kind. The tide of feeling
   having passed far out, exhausting itself in the effort, is naturally
   liable to retreat upon itself to a corresponding extent. In the purely
   antagonistic emotions, as will be seen on the least reflection, self is
   all predominant and obtrusive. The emotive capacity, instead of passing
   forth towards another, is concentrated within; and it is this feeling
   of self-concentration which in melancholy, and especially in remorse,
   constitutes the characteristic misery of these emotions. In the class
   of emotions to which we now pass, the element of self appears also
   obtrusive, but not in the same way. It is not in them necessarily or
   characteristically associated with pain; on the contrary, the common
   ground of all of them would seem to be a reflex feeling of pleasure.
   Yet they have, it is remarkable, in their reflex character, a constant
   tendency to pass over to a painful excess.

   Of this class of emotions, pride is one of the most distinguishing. In
   its most general form, it seems to be simply self taking the measure of
   its own claims alongside those of others. It always implies this
   element of comparison. When the comparison is made with fairness, we
   recognise the propriety of the feeling--as in the common expression, a
   proper pride. Where, again, the comparison is grossly mistaken and
   over-estimated by self in its own favour, the feeling assumes that
   excessive form, in which it becomes so odious to others, and often such
   a source of misery to its subject. Vanity seems again to be the simple
   pampering of self-complacency--self dwelling on its own image till it
   can scarcely find interest or beauty in any other.

   Directly converse to such emotions are those of humility and modesty.
   The former may be defined to be the simple opposite of pride--the
   retirement of self from the assertion even of rightful claims which it
   might prefer before others. It, too, seems always to involve an element
   of comparison; and, in a similar manner to pride, it may so greatly and
   obviously mistake the comparison as to become disagreeably excessive.
   The only case in which it can never do so, is in reference to the
   Supreme Being, before whom the most extreme retirement of self is not
   only appropriate, but demanded. And hence we recognise the primary
   importance of this emotion in religion. Modesty is also, may we not
   say, a species of self-denial--self shrinking from the acknowledgment
   of claims of which it is yet dimly conscious. It is self-repressive,
   peculiarly; and yet self does not, as in humility, retire out of sight.
   It is this curious balance of emotion, in which self is negatived, and
   yet, with a vaguely conscious justice, stands forward (the internal
   conflict betraying itself in the suffusion of the face with blushes),
   which gives to modesty that special charm which all recognise in it.

   The large and diversified group of emotions of which tenderness is the
   most diffused element, and love the most expressive type, may next
   engage attention. They operate over human life with a vast influence,
   and invest it with its most solemn and beautiful interest. They are all
   of a social character, binding the race into families, and pervading it
   from rank to rank with reciprocal relations of the most happy and
   beneficent kind.

   There is no range of emotion more enlarged or more minutely subdivided
   than this of tenderness, not to speak of the antagonistic range of
   emotions which here also lies alongside. All the affections are based
   on it, from the mere fondness of infancy to the exquisite
   passionateness of sexual and parental regard. It embraces equally the
   tranquil interest of friendship and the lofty zeal of patriotism. It is
   the chord which vibrates in the warm-heartedness of the host, the
   geniality of the old schoolfellow, and the kindness of neighbourhood.
   Compassion and sympathy are among its most influential manifestations,
   springing from a fountain of good in the social bosom, and spreading
   around them, as they flow, unnumbered blessings. Respect, esteem,
   veneration, blending as they do to a greater or less degree merely
   intellectual elements, may all be traced back to it; and finally,
   worship is best expressed by the name of love, in which at once the
   emotion culminates, and of which throughout it testifies. This form of
   moral feeling is the flower of the emotive capacity. It is the richest
   and worthiest outgoing of man's spiritual activity, the course of which
   is everywhere and always more continually beneficent, and which, in
   this its inexhaustibleness, or rather ever-accumulating force of good,
   contains the pledge of its own peculiar immortality. In its more
   special meaning it has been supposed [134] to imply not merely the
   going forth of good towards an object, but the meeting of good in that
   object, the term benevolence being used to express the love of that
   which in itself does not contain any love-worthiness. There is only, as
   it were, room for love after benevolence has accomplished its end, in
   bringing the object into a state of wellbeing or love-worthiness. There
   is something in this distinction, and yet we question the propriety of
   so fixing down or confining the name of love. The distinction seems to
   us to be not between one species or shade of affection and another, but
   rather between a complete and incomplete enjoyment or fruition of the
   same affection. Love may certainly, in the purest and loftiest sense,
   go forth towards wretchedness, but it cannot, so to speak, complete
   itself towards it by embracing it till the wretchedness is turned away.
   So far, however, we apprehend, is love from being postponed till this
   result, that it is the very energy and activity of the love
   concentrated on the object which accomplish the result.

   The pleasure which attends the exercise of the benevolent affections
   has been rightly considered a special proof of the Divine goodness. The
   mere existence of these affections sufficiently shows that goodness.
   The mere presence of love in human life, pervading and beautifying it
   in so many forms, attests the presence of love in the great Source of
   that life. But the fact of our not only having such emotions implanted
   in us, but of our deriving from their exercise such pure delight, while
   the gratification of the opposite evil emotions is accompanied with
   pain, is a fact of peculiar significance. For what is its language?
   Does it not say with clearest force that the good alone is divine? We
   are so constituted, that in imparting happiness through the channel of
   any one of the benevolent emotions, we ourselves experience happiness;
   while, on the contrary, through the indulgence of envy or hatred, or
   any other of the malevolent emotions, we ourselves suffer in imparting
   suffering. So radically is the good fixed in our natures that its
   violation thus avenges itself. Putting out of question, then, in the
   mean time, how such evil affections emerge in human nature--looking
   only at its actual constitution--it seems impossible to imagine how it
   could have borne stronger testimony to the Divine goodness; for it not
   only expresses the good, but delights in it. The good is not only,
   notwithstanding all that may be said to the contrary, the most
   prominent fact in human nature, but it thus approves itself to be the
   only normal action of human nature. Our delight in welldoing says, as
   powerfully as it is possible to say it, that man was made to be good
   and to do good; or, in other words, that the Author of his being is
   good.

   The partial happiness that lies in the indulgence of evil affections,
   expressed in the word gratification, equally used with reference to
   them, does not at all militate against this conclusion, for this is
   simply an accidental result of their accomplished activity. They and
   all our mental activities cannot express themselves successfully
   without a certain measure of enjoyment; but such is the essential
   destructiveness of the evil that its very gratification is in the end
   its most perfect misery. Its continued successes, affording a minimum
   of enjoyment all along its course--as in the case of the drunkard, or
   the continued gratification of hatred or cruelty--become its
   accumulating curse. Nature thus everywhere bears her testimony against
   the evil, stamping it with her reprobation amid whatever apparent
   triumph--uttering her voice against it, however it may exalt
   itself--and so declaring, in the most emphatic and unceasing language,
   that the good alone is divine; or, in other words, that God is good,
   and alone loveth good.

   The foregoing ranges of emotional activity are found for the most part
   represented throughout the sphere of animal existence, while yet only
   reaching their highest expression in man. We now approach a class of
   emotions which there is reason to think are peculiar to the human
   mind--a class which, for our general purpose, may be sufficiently
   designated as the emotions of taste--including our sentiments of
   harmony, beauty, sublimity, and their opposites. We can only here
   indicate the fact of these emotions, and their bearing on our subject;
   their analysis, it is well known, involving some of the most
   keenly-contested problems in psychological science. It is sufficient,
   in our point of view, to observe their high use in man's constitution.
   They are, and have ever been, recognised among its most delightful
   springs of elevated progress. They minister purely to mental
   gratification and culture, and have no lower function in reference to
   our mere animal nature, a fact which sufficiently accounts for their
   being confined to man. This feature of the emotions of taste has been
   pointed out with his accustomed acuteness by Dr Thomas Brown, and the
   appropriate theological inference so well expressed by him that we
   gladly avail ourselves of his language. [135] "In no part of our
   nature," he says, "is the pure benevolence of Heaven more strikingly
   conspicuous than in our susceptibility of the emotions of this class.
   The pleasure which they afford is a pleasure that has no immediate
   connection with the means of preservation of our animal existence; and
   which shows, therefore, though all other proof were absent, that the
   Deity who superadded these means of delight must have had some other
   object in view in forming us as we are, than the mere continuance of a
   race of beings who were to save the earth from becoming a wilderness.
   In consequence of these emotions, which have made all nature beauty to
   our eye, and music to our ear,' it is scarcely possible for us to look
   around without feeling either some happiness or some consolation.
   Sensual pleasures soon pall even upon the profligate, who seeks them in
   vain in the means which were accustomed to produce them, weary almost
   to disgust of the very pleasures which he seeks, and yet astonished
   that he does not find them. The labours of severer intellect, if long
   continued, exhaust the energy which they employ, and we cease for a
   time to be capable of thinking accurately, from the very intentness and
   accuracy of our thought. The pleasures of taste, however, by their
   variety of easy delight, are safe from the languor which attends any
   monotonous or severe occupation; and instead of palling on the mind,
   they produce in it, with the very delight which is present, a quicker
   sensibility to future pleasure. Enjoyment springs from enjoyment; and
   if we have not some deep wretchedness within, it is scarcely possible
   for us, with the delightful resources which nature and art present to
   us, not to be happy as often as we will to be happy." [136]

   There is a further large group of emotive powers, whose special
   significance in human life will by no means allow us to pass them by.
   They are distinguished from those previously reviewed by a special
   character of activity and complexity. The mind no longer simply feels,
   but desires. A special energy has arisen in the bosom, of some simple
   mental experience, which goes forth, often with great force, in search
   of its object. The desires, therefore, in the emotional sphere, are
   parallel to the appetites in the sensational. In both, the attitude of
   the mind is no longer merely that of feeling, but of wishing.

   Desire is almost endlessly diversified, according to its objects, which
   it were in vain to try to enumerate. Dr Brown has summed up the more
   general and important forms of desire in a tenfold series. But if it
   were necessary for us to attempt such an analysis, it would be easy to
   reduce them to a broader and more general basis. We are inclined to
   think, indeed, that, according to a right interpretation of the first
   of Dr Brown's series, all the others might be considered simply
   modifications of it--viz. the desire of life. If we understand life to
   mean the sum not only of physical but of mental existence--a sense in
   which we may say it is parallel with happiness (everywhere, as we have
   seen, its proper correlate)--all our desires will be found to be only
   various forms of the desire of life, or, in other words, of pleasurable
   activity. Desire only responds to pleasure in some shape or another.
   Whatever may be the object, it is only as it is seen to be pleasurable
   that it is desired. The desire of life, therefore, in our sense, may be
   made to include every other mode of desire.

   Dr Brown, indeed, seems to think that there may be a desire of life--of
   simple existence--apart from any consideration of pleasure; [137] but
   it appears to us that he has here confounded, with what alone can be
   properly called the desire of life, the simple movement of
   self-preservation. This latter, however, has no title to stand as an
   emotion--it is a mere blind ineradicable instinct. It is so truly
   ineradicable, and almost physical in its character, that it may be
   found asserting itself even in the hour of self-destruction. The desire
   of life, on the contrary, is a special mental feeling, entertained and
   cherished with various degrees of force, and capable, in certain cases,
   of being altogether overpowered and destroyed. And what are our desires
   of pleasure and of action (the second and third of Dr Brown's series),
   but the desire of intenser forms of life? And our desire of knowledge,
   what is it but simply the desire of life in a more exalted and
   interesting character than hitherto experienced? And so of power, which
   is only the equation of knowledge; and equally of property, which is
   but another name for power. And again, what is the desire of society
   but the desire of life intensified in a different direction--viz. from
   contact with other life? As life is essentially active, so is it
   essentially circulatory--only reaching its full being in mingling and
   sharing with other life. The desire of life, therefore, involves the
   desire of social contact and circulation. And in a being of
   intelligence and morality like man, we cannot imagine this desire of
   contact with other life--of sharing and mingling in it--without the
   desire of also approving himself to it. Hearts meeting (which is just
   moral life in circulation) cannot but seek to commend themselves to
   each other; and what is this but the desire of the affection and esteem
   of others? And in this way we have run over nearly the whole of Dr
   Brown's series. [138]

   But desire is not only thus comprehensive as an emotion in relation to
   its objects; it presents itself, moreover, in various important
   modifications--such as hope, expectation, confidence, and ambition.
   Hope is one of the most pervading, as it is one of the most delightful,
   of all our emotions. It is also one of the most thoroughly educative of
   them all, ever keeping the soul in an attitude of forwardness--ever
   embellishing with bright visions the dim future, and quickening it in
   their pursuit. It is hope alone which sustains and upholds us amid the
   actual difficulties of life. Desire alone would have been comparatively
   inadequate for such a purpose, as it relates the soul to its object
   merely in an attitude of liking--it says merely that the object is
   good; whereas hope represents the object not only as good, but as
   within reach not only as likeable, but also as attainable. Hope is,
   therefore, not only "desire intensified" (this will not give in its
   full character the complex emotion), but desire with a new element of
   strength in it, which enables the soul to go forth towards its object,
   not only with additional eagerness, but already, as it were, in
   prospect to lay hold of it. When we hope for an object, we always,
   indeed, desire it intensely; but we have also already a deeper interest
   in it--a more personal relation to it, so to speak--than any mere
   desire can give. In expectation, again, we have a still firmer and more
   secure relation to the object, and confidence is the height of
   expectation. Ambition, on the other hand, would seem to be the mere
   over-growth of desire, carrying the mind forward towards its object
   with an energy which no obstacles can turn aside.

   Curiosity is a special form of the desire of knowledge so important as
   to deserve separate mention. It is undoubtedly one of the most
   provident and benevolent principles of our mental constitution. It is
   the harbinger of intelligence in the infant breast; and, nursed by
   continually new incitements, it becomes the ever-strengthening spring
   of mental progress. It may be truly said to be inexhaustible in its
   workings, pausing merely to collect itself for a fresh advance,
   and--what especially serves to reveal the benevolence of the hand which
   implanted it--evolving ever, as it operates, fresh pleasure. "Can
   anything," says Lord Brougham, "be more perfectly contrived as an
   instrument of instruction, and an instrument precisely adapted to the
   want of knowledge, by being more powerful in proportion to the
   ignorance in which we are? Hence it is the great means by which above
   all, in early infancy, we are taught everything most necessary for our
   physical as well as moral existence. In riper years it smoothes the way
   for farther acquirements to most men; to some, in whom it is strongest,
   it opens the paths of science; but in all, without any exception, it
   prevails at the beginning of life so powerfully as to make them learn
   the faculties of their own bodies, and the general properties of those
   around them--an amount of knowledge which, for its extent and its
   practical usefulness, very far exceeds, though the most ignorant
   possess it, whatever additions the greatest philosophers are enabled to
   build upon it in the longest course of the most successful
   investigations." [139]

   The phenomena of desire, generally, are among the most
   characteristically benevolent in their intention of any in the human
   constitution. Apart from them, it may be possible to conceive human
   life prolonged through the force of the mere instinct of preservation,
   emotionally defended on all sides as it is; but, without desire, how
   stupid and aimless a thing would life have been! The greatest
   intellectual capacity would have been a mere slumbering potentiality--a
   mere vague dream, or rather nightmare, of power, from which there could
   have been no awakening. But, as it is, desire, expressing itself with
   the first movement of life, and strengthening with its growth, becomes
   the great educator of all our other activities. Under its quickening
   operation it is that the helpless child is trained to various degrees
   of manly or womanly culture and excellence--from the skilful craftsman
   to the lofty poet or philosopher--from the gentle doer of good deeds at
   home to the arduous and untiring philanthropist. It is thus truly the
   unslackening spring of human progress, relaxing not even in the hour of
   death; but, amid the withdrawal of all the objects of present desire,
   carrying the soul forward in hope and triumph to other and higher
   regions of mental and moral development. [140]

   [129] We are sensible that these very names already suggest an

   suggestions which everywhere necessarily arise with the very first
   statement of the evidence for the Divine goodness.

   [135] Apart from the appropriate beauty of Dr Brown's language, we have
   not hesitated, on another account, to avail ourselves of it to the
   extent we have done in this chapter. It is peculiarly satisfactory to
   present the conclusions for which we naturally seek in the words of one
   to whom they came by force of their own clearness and strength, while
   engaged in the mere analysis of the phenomena, without any view to
   their theological meaning. It has seemed an advantage that it should be
   thus clearly seen that we are not led to impose a meaning on the
   phenomena which they do not in themselves naturally and irresistibly
   suggest.

   [138] It is needless to say that we do not claim for this analysis any
   scientific worth. It may seem, indeed, that in making the desire of
   life, as pleasurable activity, the type of our various desires, we are
   merely saying that desire, in all its forms, is desire.

SECTION III.

MORAL INTUITIVE EVIDENCE.
     __________________________________________________________________

§ III.--CHAPTER I.

  MORAL INTUITIVE EVIDENCE.

   THE theistic evidence universally runs back into a region of First
   Truths or Principles. It rests only on a definite spiritual philosophy,
   as we have seen in the outset. It remains to be further seen how it
   only attains to its highest force and significance in the same region.
   An attentive examination of certain features of our spiritual life will
   be found to yield a set of theistic elements of a peculiarly direct and
   important kind, which are necessary to complete our evidence, and to
   carry upwards the conceptions of power, wisdom, and goodness, already
   unfolded, into the full conception of God.

   We deem it unnecessary to enter into any question as to the separate
   force and value of this department of evidence. All such questions are,
   according to our view, quite irrelevant. For the genuine apprehension
   of the theistic evidence is not that of a series of separate and
   independent proofs, but that of a great scheme of argument presenting
   itself under a variety of aspects. All special instances of design
   derive their conclusive force from certain principles; and these
   principles again must be seen in practical manifestation, in order to
   bring before us a lively and clear impression of the Divine existence
   and attributes.

   In assigning a distinctive name to this section, we do not mean,
   therefore, to detach it from our inductive scheme of evidence. We mean
   simply to point out the distinctive range of inquiry before us, which
   is sufficiently marked off from that in which we have been engaged. We
   are no longer merely to be concerned with facts from which we are
   warranted to infer Divine wisdom and goodness, but with facts which, in
   a peculiar sense, reveal to us God, which bring God before us
   intuitively, rather than in the ordinary inductive way. We enter among
   those prime elements of our spiritual constitution which are the
   appropriate organs of the theistic conception. This conception, in its
   radical form of cause, took its rise in this region, and here no less
   is it found to complete itself.

   This may serve to explain the views of some of our highest thinkers as
   to the supposed conclusive force of the moral, in comparison with all
   other evidence for the being of a God. Kant, after submitting to a
   destructive criticism all the other modes of theistic evidence, as
   separately apprehended in his day, made the existence of God a
   postulate of our moral being; and Sir W. Hamilton has expressly said
   that "the only valid arguments for the existence of a God, and for the
   immortality of the human soul, rest on the ground of man's moral
   nature." [141] Now, in so far as such views merely imply that to the
   region of moral consciousness must be traced the foundation of the
   theistic argument, and its peculiar seat, we are prepared to coincide
   with them. But we cannot assent to any view which would limit the
   evidence to this region. It finds here its peculiar home; but it by no
   means stops here. Springing from the depths of our moral consciousness,
   it is taken up by the intellectual common sense; and the special
   argument from design is neither more nor less than the application
   which is thus made of the primary theistic principle. It becomes us not
   to forget the origin of the principle--through which alone the idea of
   design is tenable--but it becomes us also to acknowledge the
   appropriate value and the clear and impressive bearing of this idea, as
   applied to the display of the Divine attributes. The theistic evidence
   is only seen in its full strength when it is thus recognised in its
   full comprehensiveness.

§ III.--CHAPTER II.

  FREEDOM--DIVINE PERSONALITY.

   THE fact which demands our consideration in this chapter is of the
   utmost importance, not only in respect of the theistic meaning which
   still remains to be drawn from it, but as constituting, moreover, the
   real foundation of our whole evidence. For already, in our preliminary
   chapters, its reality was presupposed, and the weight of our initiative
   conclusion made to rest upon it. It is, therefore, eminently the
   theistic fact round which, as their rational nucleus, all the others
   gather.

   The exact character of the fact is to be carefully kept in view. It is
   of this sort: Is man's rational being essentially distinct from nature?
   Does it constitute a source of activity, in a sense altogether unique
   and contradistinguished from any other movements we perceive in nature?
   While the latter, through all its range, is a mere series of sequences,
   of arrangements, and re-arrangements, in the same unbroken flow, is
   there in man something wholly different, which cannot be resolved into
   any mere play of sequences, but constitutes a source of power? Is
   there, in short, a soul in man? This seems to us the last and simplest
   reduction of the question. According to the affirmative view of this
   question, mind, in its full meaning, is not only something specifically
   different in its manifestations from matter, but something in its root
   and character essentially contradistinguished from matter. In the
   various forms, indeed, in which it expresses itself, or becomes
   phenomenal, it obeys the same law of sequences which obtains among all
   other phenomena; but in its spring and source it wholly evades this
   merely natural law, and refuses to be bound by it. It is only in this
   apprehension of mind that we found that fact of efficiency with which
   we set out, and without which our argument has no rational basis
   whereon to rest.

   This fact of a free rational activity, or soul in man, is implied in
   every form of spiritual philosophy, and appears to constitute the
   essential basis of all theology. It has, however, beyond doubt, been
   greatly obscured by certain views which have long held sway, both in
   philosophy and in theology. These views have been all the more powerful
   that they express so far an undoubted truth, and have been supposed to
   bear with a peculiar effect upon the confirmation of certain Christian
   doctrines. In so far as they can be held consistently with our
   fundamental position--and we cannot imagine any Christian necessitarian
   denying that position--we have, of course, no controversy with such
   views. It must at the same time be observed, and deserves to be
   carefully considered in such a discussion as the present, that whatever
   consistency there may be between a true doctrine of necessity, and that
   assertion of a free rational activity in man which is the basis of our
   argument, and however that doctrine may be authorised by great names,
   it is yet in no sense a Christian doctrine; and that those truths of
   Scripture, in whose defence it has been supposed to be triumphantly
   wielded, are wholly independent of any logical strength thence derived,
   as they had, in fact, assumed their place in the great scheme of
   Protestant belief long before any of those formal enunciations of the
   doctrine of necessity, to which so much weight has been attributed.

   The best way of clearing up the bearing of such views upon our position
   will be by a brief re-statement and examination of it. We shall
   approach it from facts formerly reached. Already, in the mere presence
   of sentient and even organic life, we found, in some sense, a centre of
   action. Every such existence develops itself from within. But this
   development is, in such cases, bound to an immutable necessity of
   nature. It is throughout physically conditioned. The evolution of self
   is, on this lower platform of life, a mere determination of natural
   causes. The question before us is one which concerns the character of
   this self-evolution in man. Is it in him nothing more than it is in the
   lower animals--the mere play of nature, "the mere result of physical
   succession;" or is it something wholly peculiar, and, if not
   independent of nature, yet by no means subject to it? Do we find, in
   short, within us not merely a power of action, under the impulse of
   physical causes, but a power of action which owns no law ab extra, but
   is what we call free? That we have some such power of free action, not
   merely a feeling of self, which would seem to be the condition of all
   mental existence, but a feeling of what has been called
   self-determination or choice, cannot admit of dispute. Every one must
   allow that he has such a power of doing what he will. All language and
   all social practice imply so much.

   But this, it is said, is little to the point: for while it is admitted
   that man seems to act freely--nay, that, in a certain sense, he does so
   act--it is nevertheless true that his action always follows the
   strongest motive, just as effect follows cause. Inasmuch as he cannot
   act without motive, the motive felt by him to be the strongest at the
   time, and under which he does act, is the cause of his action. His
   rational activity analysed is found to be everywhere encompassed by a
   subtle atmosphere of motives strictly and rigorously conditioning it.
   All the particular facts of his mental life are thus only links in a
   great chain of necessity, although he may not feel them to be so. The
   law of cause and effect obtains among them, and binds them all, no less
   surely than it is found to regulate and control all other facts. In
   these views there is an amount of truth which none now dispute, however
   they may object to the language in which it is sometimes expressed. It
   is undeniable that man's intellectual and moral being, in all its most
   subtle and complex manifestations, shows the same order that we
   everywhere discover in nature. It was our special aim, in previous
   chapters, to expose, in some degree, this order. If this, therefore, be
   all that is anywhere meant by the doctrine of necessity, that doctrine
   must be held as expressive of an important truth. But something far
   more than this is maintained by most necessitarians, and seems to be
   logically implied in the doctrine. They mean not only to assert that
   man's rational activity displays itself under the same law of cause and
   effect as the course of nature does, but that there is really nothing
   more in it than this display. Volition goes forth under motive; motive,
   again, is dependent on organisation, or at least on some external
   cause; and this is all. The whole question plainly lies in this higher
   region. What constitutes motive? What is the spring of the order which
   is universally admitted to obtain among the facts of man's spiritual
   being, no less than among all other facts? Is that spring in nature,
   and bound to its immutable sequences? or is it deep in the central
   being of the man himself, and essentially separated from nature? The
   materialistic necessitarian holds as his cardinal principle the former
   of these views. He knows nothing beyond the mere series of phenomena
   which collectively he may call Mind. Any spiritual unit or soul beneath
   the multiplicity, and therein expressing itself, while yet essentially
   distinguished from it, has no place in his system; and quite
   consistently so. The theological necessitarian of course shrinks from
   this conclusion, but his language has not unfrequently been such as to
   bear it out. Carrying up with an iron hand the phenomenal law of cause
   and effect into the region of spiritual life, he may have seemed to
   gain a temporary triumph over an adversary; but he has done so too
   often at the risk of total peril to his faith, and to the very ground
   and condition of all religion.

   The true advocate of liberty, on the other hand, simply maintains that
   in the last resource the mind or soul is unconditioned by any natural
   cause. The self-conscious reason, or ego, is incompressible by the law
   of phenomena. It only is, and lives in opposition to that law. The
   spring of the soul's activity is ever within the soul. It displays
   itself, no doubt, serially, in regular obedience to the strongest
   motive; but the strength of the motive comes from within, from the
   soul's own preference; otherwise it would be truly no motive, but would
   for ever remain a mere inducement or solicitation presenting itself to
   the mind. It is always the mind's own act that changes a mere
   inducement into a motive, and leads to action. According to the
   well-known pithy saying of Coleridge, "it is not the motive makes the
   man, but the man the motive."

   The liberty thus defined, it may deserve to be remarked, is entirely
   different from the old imagination of a liberty of indifference. This
   latter represented the mind, as it were, in equilibrio, till it put
   forth the power of choice among the motives bearing upon it. It placed
   the soul, as it were, on one side, and motives on the other, and
   pretended to give an explanation of the mode of action between the two.
   The true theory of liberty makes no such pretensions; it knows nothing
   of the soul save as active. An abstract potentiality, which of its own
   sovereignty keeps itself apart from motives, or yields to them at
   pleasure, is in no respect recognised by it. It simply contends, that
   in every case of actual human conduct the motive power is from within
   the soul itself, and not in any respect physically conditioned. It
   simply says that man is free to act, but it does not pretend for a
   moment to explain the mode of his freedom. This it so little does that
   it acknowledges the fact of human freedom to be in its very character
   inexplicable.

   This character of mystery--of irresolvability, under the great
   inductive law of cause and effect--comprises, in truth, all that can be
   argumentatively said against the doctrine of liberty. The fact will not
   come within the conditions of our logical faculty, and must therefore
   be repelled. But this is a thoroughly vicious mode of argument: for, by
   the very supposition, the fact transcends these conditions; and to
   reject it on this account is simply to beg the whole question. If this
   fact be at all, it is primary and constitutive, and therefore not to be
   reasoned to, but from. It stands at the head of our rational nature as
   its source. And as such a source--as the inherent activity whence all
   our mental modes are born--the fountain whence they flow--the me, of
   which they are the varied manifestations--it defies the application of
   that inductive law under which they arise, and for the very reason that
   it is what it is--not any one of these modes, but the root of them
   all--not any of the manifold sides of consciousness, but the unity in
   which all its sides centre. In this view it is not only not wonderful
   that we cannot understand freedom, but the fact is such in its very
   idea that it is impossible we ever can understand it, transcending as
   it necessarily does that logical power of which it is the condition.
   Thus apprehended in its primitive distinction, it leaves us no
   alternative but to abide by it in its necessary incomprehensibility. It
   is there--we are bound to recognise it. But we have no claim to
   comprehend it, for (as logicians) we do not contain it--it contains us.
   Whatever we are in our mental and practical character is just the
   expression of this mysterious personality, to which all our activity
   leads back, and from which it all flows.

   It is as the irresistible testimony of consciousness that this fact
   forces acceptance. It attests its reality within us, and we cannot get
   quit of it under whatever ingenuity of explanation. On this ground the
   advocate of liberty has an advantage which is wholly indisputable; for
   that we feel ourselves to be free, none can truly deny. This
   feeling--our deepest and most ineradicable consciousness--the doctrine
   of necessity cannot accept as a fact; or, if it does, we have no
   dispute with it; only we do not see how it can consistently maintain
   itself if it does. For the feeling cannot represent a reality, and yet
   man's spiritual, no less than his material being, be held as naturally
   determined. In such a case the feeling can only be an illusion, and man
   a bondman, wholly a creature of nature, howsoever he may seem every
   moment to create a circle of free activity around him. But if
   consciousness be thus held false, man is cast adrift on an ocean of
   utter uncertainty. Truth becomes for him a mere dream, if the voice
   within him be held incompetent to give it valid utterance.

   The deliverance of consciousness is, on the contrary, held by the
   advocate of freedom to be at once decisive and ultimate on the point.
   It is not, in his view, any mere dim experience which disappears under
   analysis, but a truth which makes itself good under whatever logical
   assaults. The alternative is simply one of fact. The human
   consciousness either tells the truth absolutely, unheeding how it may
   clash with some other truth in the dim-lighted chamber of the logical
   understanding, or it must be admitted to be false. No saving clauses of
   ingenious explanation will avail. Man is either free really, or he is
   not free. There is in him a centre of action wholly peculiar, a
   naturally undetermined source of activity, otherwise his deepest
   experience belies itself, and his moral nature is a devout imagination.
   There is nothing but the recognition of such a free agency in man,
   however mysterious and unaccountable, that can preserve to him faith in
   himself, or the perilous dignity of responsibility among the creatures
   of earth. If he has not in a true sense such a power of action
   springing from within his own spiritual being, his consciousness
   deceives him, and he is and can be nothing else than a mere
   irresponsible link in the chain of phenomena.

   As the only rational means of escape from such a conclusion,
   consciousness must be held in its attestation of freedom to express a
   reality, to declare a truth, admitting of no exception, however
   ingeniously represented. Man must be recognised as free in a sense
   quite peculiar, separating him from all other earthly creatures. While
   owning, in the actual course of his thought and volition, the great
   phenomenal law of cause and effect, there must be admitted to be in him
   at the same time a mysterious centre of personality--nothing else than
   the soul, which withdraws itself from this law, and asserts itself
   against it.

   What, then, is the bearing of this fact on our subject? As we
   previously said, it is the most vital for our purpose in our whole
   range of inquiry; but just corresponding with its peculiar depth and
   importance is the difficulty of fully seizing and expressing its
   significance. We have already seen in what respect it lies at the root
   of our inductive evidence as the source of our idea of cause. The
   strange relation of affinity and yet conflict which thus emerges
   between the principles of personality and causality were an interesting
   subject of consideration, but cannot occupy us here. [142] We have at
   present simply to do with the direct import of the fact of personality
   in the enlargement of our theistic evidence. In tracing back our mental
   life, we have this fact as the last word for reason. The Me asserts
   itself as an inscrutable reality, beyond which we cannot go in the way
   of natural explanation. It refuses obstinately to be related to any
   higher fact, as a natural sequence. But have we not thus reached a
   startling conclusion? If the human ego be thus as it so clearly
   pronounces itself to be, a cause in the highest and indeed only true
   sense--viz. a naturally undetermined source of activity--is it not
   thereby, in its very character, its own author? If undetermined, is it
   not necessarily independent?

   So far is this from being the case, that we here approach the very
   peculiarity of the theistic meaning which this prime fact yields us;
   for, in the very act of expressing itself, it is found to be its
   essential characteristic, at the same time, to express Another. It only
   realises itself in Another. The more we sink back into the depths of
   consciousness, and the more vivid force and reality with which we seize
   our personal being, as something unconditioned by nature, and rising
   above it, the more directly and immediately do we at the same time
   apprehend ourselves as relative and dependent. The more we become
   self-conscious, the more do we feel, at the same time, that the ground
   of our existence is not in ourselves, but in Another and a Higher. Our
   personality, in asserting itself to be distinct from nature, yet with
   equal force asserts itself to be derived, or, in other language, to
   take its rise in a Principle above nature. The human self, in a word,
   irresistibly suggests a divine Self; the limited cause, an absolutely
   original and unlimited Cause.

   It is true that we thus, in the last analysis, bring into special
   prominence the logical incomprehensibility which meets us in the
   testimony of consciousness. We realise ourselves as free, and yet
   dependent. Nay, in our very freedom we at the same time find our
   dependency. The more we sink into ourselves, the more do we feel
   ourselves to rest on a Higher. Just as we accept the testimony of
   consciousness in giving us liberty--the soul's efficiency for its own
   acts--so do we accept its testimony in giving a relation to this
   efficiency in the All-efficient. Let it be that we cannot construe to
   ourselves this relation intelligibly--cannot compass it in
   thought--this is no valid ground for rejecting either term of it. We
   can only do so by trampling upon consciousness, and exposing ourselves
   to the whole peril of scepticism. The facts must be accepted as given,
   however impossible it may be for us to join them logically together;
   and for this obvious reason, which, if it does not give satisfaction,
   ought yet to give resignation, that our mere capacity of thought
   cannot, in the nature of the case, be the measure of truth here nor
   anywhere. Great master in its own sphere (in the evolution and
   determination of all the forms of science), it must yet be content to
   be the minister of reality.

   It is requisite to observe the full import of our conclusion. Our own
   personality not only gives another personality, but another which is at
   the same time absolute. It is, in fact, the special rational intuition
   of the absolute in the relative--the infinite in the finite--which
   carries us beyond the Self within, to a Self without and above us. How
   vital, in a theistic sense, this intuition is, must therefore be
   obvious. But it is not our aim at present to insist upon the reality of
   the infinite which thus dawns upon us. This reality will afterwards
   engage us separately. We would now rather simply fix attention on the
   fact of Divine personality, so vividly brought before us.

   Of all the facts of Theism this may be said to be the most fundamental,
   as it is that in which all the others inhere, and find their life. It
   is a fact which already we had virtually found in the theistic
   conclusion which we established in our first section. For an
   intelligent First Cause, according to our mode of reaching and
   authenticating the idea, could only be a living Personality. This great
   truth of the Divine Personality, however, comes before us here with
   intuitive brightness. It reveals itself as the clear reflection--the
   abglanz, as the Germans expressively term it--of our own personality.
   [143] The Thou of our prayers rises in solemn reality against our own
   most hidden self-consciousness. Our deepest life centres in Another, in
   whom alone "we live, and move, and have our being." In comparison with
   every other apprehension of God this apprehension of Him is immediate
   and decisive. We rejoice to trace Him also in nature; we gladden to
   greet His presence in every bursting flower, in every curious organism,
   in the heavens and in the earth. But while we only search in nature, we
   search as with veiled gaze, "if haply we might feel after Him, and find
   Him." It is only in the depths of self-reflection--within its most
   secret chambers--that we become conscious of His immediate presence,
   and know that He is "not far from every one of us."

   NOTE.

   There is a relation of the whole subject arising out of this chapter,
   which can scarcely fail to suggest itself to the speculative reader,
   and which may claim from us a passing notice, in case it should be
   supposed that we have overlooked it. The basis of our preliminary
   reasoning, it will be remembered, was the rational necessity that
   compelled us to find a cause at the head of nature. We cannot conceive
   a mere endless series of relative phenomena. We must have a cause or
   origin of the series; or, in other words, according to our whole view,
   an efficient Agent or Mind. Yet it is certainly true, as we have freely
   admitted in this chapter, that we cannot compass in thought, or
   conceive, in this lower sense, such an efficient agent. The argument
   seems to run up into a contradiction or antagonism of
   inconceivabilities. And if we confine ourselves to the sphere of mere
   thought or logical comprehension, there seems to be no escape from the
   contradiction. We are bandied about from one horn of the logical
   dilemma to another, in a hopeless state of confusion and perplexity.
   Let the speculative reader, who desires to see the contradiction which
   thus arises fully exposed, and in its bearing, too, on the subject of
   this chapter, consult Sir W. Hamilton's Discussions, Appendix, p. 591
   et seq.

   Sir William's mode of escape from the difficulty we cannot accept. The
   principle of causality he considers to be the mere issue of our
   intellectual impotency to conceive anything save as related in time.
   The principle of personality or liberty is with him equally the fruit
   of a similar impotency to conceive an infinite series of relations.
   Both, therefore, being mere impotencies of human thought, their mutual
   contradiction does not necessarily imply the falsehood of either.

   The seeming contradiction vanishes with us in a different, and, as we
   think, more satisfactory way. Causality and personality have, in our
   view, one and the same root, which, from the first, is found in a
   sphere beyond logic. So far from being the mere issue of opposing
   negations, as Sir William Hamilton makes them, both principles take
   their rise in the most living reality of existence, the ego. That every
   effect must have a cause, means simply that everything implies as its
   source a living agent or mind; and this living agent or mind is simply
   a personality. We cannot conceive things save as the production of such
   a mind. Our reason demands such a mind. The inconceivability here is a
   complete rational inconceivability. There is no escape from it. And if
   it be also true that we cannot logically conceive, comprehend, or
   contain in thought such a mind, yet there is every difference between
   this and the inconceivability in the former case. This is merely
   negative, springing out of the necessary limitations of human thought.
   The former is not only negative, but issues out of a positive demand of
   reason on the other side. It would be more correct, in fact, to
   restrict the use of the term inconceivable to the former case: for
   although we cannot think, or construe to ourselves logically, an
   efficient cause or mind, such a cause is so far from being
   inconceivable to reason that reason expressly demands and affirms it.
   The reality of such a higher power of reason, which inseparably blends
   with faith, and is the organ of the unconditioned and insensible (see
   subsequent chapter), is implied in our whole course of reasoning. The
   truths revealed in this higher reason are not, properly speaking,
   inconceivable: they are only incomprehensible. The intellect cannot
   compass them; and this is of their very nature, because they are what
   they are--primary and not derivative.

   [143] Those who are familiar with the elaborate treatise of Dr Julius
   Müller on the Christian Doctrine of Sin, may recognise a similarity
   between the process of theistic reasoning in this chapter, and that
   contained in the second chapter of the first book of that treatise, p.
   79, vol. i. et seq. The writer gratefully acknowledges his obligations
   to Dr Müller here and elsewhere. It will be seen, at the same time,
   that his own course of argument, in the present case, is sufficiently
   distinctive.

§ III.--CHAPTER III.

  CONSCIENCE DIVINE RIGHTEOUSNESS.

   AS freedom is the fundamental condition of our moral being, so
   conscience is its guide and regulator. The soul, while self-acting, is
   at the same time spiritually controlled. It is then, indeed, most
   itself, most truly free, when most fully informed and controlled by
   conscience.

   As in the case of every other element of man's spiritual being, the
   special character of conscience has been greatly disputed. Philosophy
   has found here even a favourite field of struggle. Among all our most
   earnest thinkers, however, there may be said to be at length something
   like unanimity in regarding conscience as a primitive and distinct fact
   or faculty. The attempts which have been made to resolve it into some
   simpler element of our mental constitution have merely served to prove
   the intimate alliance between conscience and our other mental powers,
   and their necessary influence upon its education and development. But
   in no case have they sufficed fully to explain its origin. The most
   skilful analysis of the association of ideas, or of our common
   intellectual judgments, into both of which it has been sought to be
   explained, still leaves a residuary element unaccounted for, which,
   whatever name we give to it, is nothing else than the germ which
   expands into the full moral reality which we mean by conscience.

   In its most general application it may be defined as that element of
   our being by which we become conscious of duty. It introduces man into
   a set of relations bearing to him the peculiar character of obligation,
   which, however little he may be able to analyse it, is felt by him in
   the strongest manner. Viewed as a mental power, its chief peculiarity
   accordingly consists in the position which it thus assumes amongst our
   other powers. It not only perceives, but commands; not only points the
   way, but orders to walk in it.

   Since the profound and luminous expositions of Butler, in his Sermons
   on Human Nature, the attention of moralists has been prominently fixed
   on this authoritative aspect of conscience. Its special function has
   been recognised as that of a guide and governor. It is impossible, as
   Butler has pointed out, to dissociate from it the notion of direction
   and superintendency. "This is a constituent part of the idea--that is,
   of the faculty itself; and to preside and govern, from the very economy
   and constitution of man, belongs to it." "This faculty," he adds, "was
   placed within us to be our proper governor; to direct and regulate all
   under principles, passions, and motives of action. This is its right
   and office. Thus sacred is its authority. And how often soever men
   violate and rebelliously refuse to submit to it, for supposed interest
   which they cannot otherwise obtain, or for the sake of passion which
   they cannot otherwise gratify, this makes no alteration as to the
   natural right and office of conscience." Even when its judgments are
   set aside, or trampled under foot, by the perverse force of the will,
   conscience, as Butler here truly indicates, does not, rightly speaking,
   lose its authority. It holds the transgressor in its grasp, and can
   bring him trembling before its judgment-seat, even when he would seem
   to have broken loose from all its restraints, and completely overborne
   its power. It asserts its sovereignty with a fearful reality, even
   although its sceptre has been broken, and its throne desecrated. Aloft
   itself, even among the ruins of its kingdom, it arraigns the stoutest
   rebel, and often holds in cowering bondage the most reckless criminal.
   "Had it strength, as it has right; had it power, as it has manifest
   authority, it would," in Butler's expressive language, "absolutely
   govern the world."

   It is especially this supreme and legislative aspect of conscience
   which gives it significance for the natural theologian. As a simple
   fact of creation it yields, undoubtedly, like every other fact, its
   appropriate testimony to the Creator; but here, in its authoritative
   import, is rightly recognised a peculiar and important element of
   theistic evidence. For the question immediately arises, whence this
   authority of conscience? Does not the very fact of a law within us
   directly testify to a Lawgiver without and above us? Does not the one
   fact, in its very nature, involve the other? The argument seems
   irresistible. The sense of government in every heart can only proceed
   from a living governor, who placed it there. The moral power within us,
   therefore, gives, as its immediate inference, a Divine Power above us.

   Every one will recognise in our statement a form of the theistic
   argument which, expounded by the zealous eloquence of Dr Chalmers, has
   passed into familiar currency in our natural theology. "The felt
   presence of a judge within the breast," he says, "powerfully and
   immediately suggests the notion of a Supreme Judge and Sovereign who
   placed it there. Upon this question the mind does not stop short at
   mere abstraction, but, passing at once from the abstract to the
   concrete, from the law of the heart it makes the rapid inference of a
   Lawgiver. The sense of a governing principle within, begets in all men
   the sentiment of a living Governor without and above them, and it does
   so with all the speed of an instantaneous feeling; yet it is not an
   impression--it is an inference notwithstanding, and as much so as any
   inference from that which is seen to that which is unseen. There is, in
   the first instance, cognisance taken of a fact, if not by the outward
   eye, yet, as good, by the eye of consciousness, which has been termed
   the faculty of internal observation. And the consequent belief of a
   God, instead of being an instinctive sense of the Divinity, is the
   fruit of an inference grounded on that fact. There is instant
   transition made, from the sense of a monitor within to the faith of a
   living Sovereign above; and this argument, described by all, but with
   such speed as almost to warrant the expression of its being felt by
   all, may be regarded, notwithstanding the force and fertility of other
   considerations, as the great prop of natural religion among men." [144]

   It is a question of little moment for the substantial conclusion
   involved--which is good in either case--whether the act by which it is
   reached be considered, with Dr Chalmers, really inductive, or rather
   intuitive. This obviously depends upon the further question as to what
   are regarded to be the special constituents of conscience. If we
   recognise it, with Butler, according to the view already set forth, to
   be itself a delegated power, and not merely the perception or
   revelation of a power, we obviously leave room for an inductive step or
   inference. We have in this view, as the immediate fact of
   consciousness, a sense of authority which, as we cannot conceive it to
   be self-constituted, we necessarily refer to a supreme or divine
   Source. But if, according to the more simple view, and what would seem
   to be the direct import of the name conscience, we consider it as not
   in any way containing in itself the power with which it rules us, but
   as directly revealing to us that power in another, then we leave no
   room for induction. We have, in the very fact of conscience, the
   intuition of the Divine will, just as we have in the fact of
   self-existence the intuition of the Divine existence. As we cannot
   realise our own being without at the same time realising another and a
   higher Being, so we cannot become conscious of duty, without at the
   same time realising another and a higher Will. The moral law is to us
   nothing more than the revelation of this higher or divine Will in the
   soul. We do not, therefore, need to rise from it to God, for it is
   already the voice of God within us. We are carried out of ourselves, so
   to speak, in the simple reality of conscience. The authority which, in
   conscience, speaks to us is not merely something from which we may
   infer a divine Power, but is already the direct expression of that
   power.

   This, upon reflection, we feel convinced, is the more just and
   penetrating view of the subject. Preserving all the truth of Butler's
   view, in even a higher form than he presented it, it gives, in a
   psychological respect, a more discriminating and consistent
   interpretation of conscience, than when it is regarded as in itself
   both a perceptive and imperative faculty. Viewed simply as the organ of
   a higher power, its psychological dignity is at once vindicated, and
   its possible abuse readily understood. For let the organ be untrained
   or neglected, and its intuition will be dim and obscure, or even
   absolutely perverted. But let it be appropriately disciplined, and its
   intuition will rise into clearness and truth. We do not see, in any
   case, how conscience can ever be adequately explained, without bringing
   into prominence the theological meaning which it so essentially
   expresses. Apart from God it would be an inexplicable riddle: held as
   revealing God, it becomes beautifully intelligible. It is the light
   within whereby we perceive at once the Hand that guides us, and,
   although more dimly, the destination that awaits us.

   We have not yet, however, exhausted the theistic significance of
   conscience. It is not merely to the fact of a divine Power that it
   testifies, but eminently to the character of that power. The moral law,
   which it reveals, is not simply the expression of a supreme Will, but
   of a Will which is essentially good and righteous. It is this, in
   truth, which gives all its force to conscience. It is by the good alone
   that it governs. It is the law of goodness which asserts itself in the
   human heart, under whatever violation, and holds itself a sovereign,
   even when its kingdom has been invaded and laid waste. To this idea of
   a Good above man, claiming his obedience, we alone owe the very
   conception of duty. It is this which gives all its peculiar sacredness
   and beauty to human life. Apart from it man would merely be as the
   brutes around him, with no nobleness of piety in his heart, and no
   long-suffering love mingling its purifying fires in his lot. In
   conscience, therefore, we must recognise a peculiar testimony to the
   divine goodness. As the organ of duty, it is in fact specifically the
   revelation of the Supreme Good. It brings man not only into converse
   with Goodness, but relates him to it, as the power which binds him in
   his daily life, and would guide him to daily happiness.

   But the divine Goodness, to which conscience testifies, is at the same
   time divine Righteousness. This is a further very significant and
   wholly peculiar element of theistic evidence disclosed in conscience.
   The Supreme Good interprets itself here as the Supreme Right. This idea
   of Right is one which, hitherto, we could not possibly have
   encountered; for it only finds an application in the region of free
   moral life, where it emerges correlatively with duty. It is the idea in
   which alone duty finds its complement, and so becomes the sacred bond
   which holds our moral being in harmony. The element or attribute of
   righteousness is one, therefore, which a comprehensive natural theology
   must ever recognise in the Divine Being. The broad and earnest mind of
   Dr Chalmers did, perhaps, especial service in making this clear and
   prominent. And it has since become more and more a matter of conviction
   that Theism is not only bound to take up this element, but that it
   furnishes, to some extent, the key to the profound mysteries which lie
   around the special attribute of divine goodness. For in order to
   perceive a benevolent meaning in much that would otherwise seem opposed
   to benevolence, we have only to see that goodness completes itself in
   righteousness, and can never validly come short of it. The conception
   of goodness becomes thus not only exalted, but discriminated. Whereas,
   in the lower regions of sentient and intellectual life, the former
   attribute is apparent merely as a disposition to bestow
   happiness--here, in the light of the further conception into which it
   rises, it appears before us as something which may, in the highest
   sense, assert itself, not certainly irrespective of happiness, yet
   apart from its immediate bestowal--yea, even in the bestowal of partial
   and temporary unhappiness. For, as the good is at the same time ever
   the right, as love only sustains itself in holiness, so it becomes
   conceivable that, where the right has been invaded, and the holy
   desecrated, goodness may express itself most distinctively in suffering
   or punishment. This bearing of the subject we now merely indicate, as
   it will afterwards come before us for special consideration.

   In the mean time we fix attention upon the fact of Righteousness, as it
   has come before us at this upward point in the course of our theistic
   evidence. It is among the last facts which meet us in the evolution of
   the idea of God, which is the appropriate task of Natural Theology; but
   in another sense it is undoubtedly among the reasoned primary springs
   of Theism. For there is no deeper or more universal source of the
   divine consciousness in every heart. It is, above all, as a righteous
   power that God is spontaneously known in the common mind. It is the
   ineradicable testimony of conscience which, above all, preserves the
   sense of Divinity in the world, amid the corruptions of passion or the
   delusions of intellectual self-conceit. It asserts a divine Presence
   with a cogency which no sophistry can parry, and no argument gainsay.
   And while man retains within him this impressive monitor, the belief in
   God can never cease, even although the manifold adaptations of matter
   and of mind should fail to arrest his wonder, and engage his study.

§ III.--CHAPTER IV.

  REASON--INFINITY.

    (À PRIORI ARGUMENT.)

   MIND begins in faith, in holding for true the objective, presented to
   it in sensible perception. Thus intuitive in its lowest energy, it is
   equally so in its highest. If, looking outward, it has no further
   explanation to render of the reality of the visible world than that it
   is present in apprehension, and therefore must be conceived as
   existent; so, looking upward from the sphere of finite reality, it
   perceives a higher world of truth, which equally makes itself good in
   apprehension.

   Such a higher power of intuition, by which we apprehend realities
   beyond the region of the sensible, is one which is admitted by every
   school of philosophy, save that which, from the extremely
   unphilosophical assumption lying at its basis, is bound to ignore
   everything beyond the sensible. [145] At the same time, there have been
   endless disputes as to the special name and character of this
   transcendant intuition. For our purpose it matters not at all how it
   may be specially designated, or even understood, so that its reality is
   confessed; whether, for example, it be identified more with the
   intellectual or moral side of our being. According to the only genuine
   conception of the human mind, this is indeed a very irrelevant
   question, as there are none of the sides of mental activity which can
   be strictly demarcated from the others, all blending as they do
   endlessly into one another. Whether, therefore, this loftiest energy of
   the soul--which relates it to a sphere of unconditioned objectivity, as
   the lower intuitional power relates it to the sphere of the
   conditioned--be conceived of as intelligence in the highest sense (the
   Nous), or as faith, it is for us of no consequence. As forming the
   highest expression of our mental activity, it seems eminently to
   deserve the special name of reason, which has often been applied to it.
   [146]

   The infinite is the peculiar object of this higher intuition. It is the
   revelation of reason as the finite is the revelation of sense. There is
   no reality, apprehended under a diversity of forms, which holds a more
   living possession of the human mind. The various notions of substance,
   space, duration, which constitute the necessary truths logically
   presupposed in all phenomena of sense and reflection, and which
   reappear in all metaphysic as its essential data, are merely different
   modes under which the infinite makes itself known. The very variety of
   these, its expressions, and the obstinacy with which, under whatever
   denial, they cling to the mind, only serve to display the richness of
   the generic truth in which they all inhere, and of which they are
   merely manifestations.

   The mode in which we have approached this subject seems to dissipate
   many of the controversies which have incumbered it. It serves to show
   the reality of the infinite as an element or constituent of human
   knowledge, without in any degree aiming to bring the infinite as an
   idea within our reach. So far as we try to seize or compass it in
   thought--or, in other words, hold it before us as an idea--it can, in
   the nature of the case, only present itself as a negation. It evades us
   in the very attempt to contain or comprehend it. But while the infinite
   is thus incomprehensible as a subject of thought, it is directly
   apprehensible as a reality of reason. Negative as an idea, it is
   positive as a fact. While we cannot think it, yet we cannot want it. It
   reveals itself as an implicate of all our more special mental
   conceptions, and it may therefore be said to guarantee itself in the
   very hold which it thus keeps of the soul, under all the baffling
   attempts of the understanding to compass it. And this is admitted by
   Sir W. Hamilton, in language than which we could desire nothing more
   plain as a confession of all that we really contend for. "We are thus
   taught," he says, "the salutary lesson that the capacity of thought is
   not to be constituted into the measure of existence, and are warned
   from recognising the domain of our knowledge as necessarily coextensive
   with the horizon of our faith. And by a wonderful revelation we are
   thus, in the very consciousness of our inability to conceive aught
   above the relative and finite, inspired with a belief in the existence
   of something unconditioned beyond the sphere of all comprehensible
   reality." [147]

   In the same point of view we see the fallacy of the Kantian doctrine of
   the infinite. Admitting it as a regulating idea of human knowledge,
   Kant yet denied to it any objective validity. The idea, according to
   him, might be necessary to us, and yet not represent a reality. And so
   it might, were the ideal or notional the mode in which the infinite is
   alone present to us. But this is so far from being the case, that the
   idea, as present in the understanding, is only the dim reflection of
   the fact present in reason. The infinite comes to us intuitively, and
   not notionally; and in this the very mode of its apprehension affirms
   its reality. The soul looks upward, and the light of the infinite dawns
   upon it. It presents itself as an objective presence--a self-revealing
   vision--and is not wrought out as a mere ideal projection from our
   mental restlessness. It is felt to be a reality containing and
   conditioning the soul, which, with all its power, it cannot think away;
   and this it could not be, were it a mere self-created form of the soul.
   The declaration of consciousness here, no less than in sensible
   perception, gives, as its indisputable contents, subject and object, in
   immediate and inseparable relation. In the one case as in the other,
   the mind "gazes upon its object with an immediacy which suffers no
   error or doubt to intervene, and gives in this way a guarantee for its
   legitimacy which it is impossible to resist." It is now, in fact,
   admitted on all hands, that Kant's denial of objectivity to the ideas
   of pure reason, and his virtual readmission of their reality as
   postulates of the practical reason, is the most inconsequent and feeble
   portion of his whole philosophy--and on the special ground, already so
   often stated by us, that we cannot legitimately disjoin the
   intellectual and the moral--the pure and the practical--and hold their
   deliverances asunder. Certainly we cannot leave out of that highest
   spiritual faculty we call reason, the element of faith, without
   destroying its essential character, and making it merely a higher form
   of the logical understanding. It is of the very essence of
   reason--regarded by us as the apex of the soul's activity--its
   consummate energy,--to be at once pure and practical, cognitive and
   moral. We have, in the last case, no higher name for knowledge
   everywhere than belief. And this belief, as Sir W. Hamilton says, is
   mistaken by Kant when recognised as "a mere spiritual craving." It is
   rather "an immediate manifestation to intelligence--not as a postulate,
   but as a datum--not as an interest in certain truths, but as the fact,
   the principle, the warrant of their cognition and reality." [148]

   No one has dwelt more fully upon the function of reason, and its use
   and value in natural theology, than M. Cousin. But while others have
   erred in undervaluing it, he has erred in unduly magnifying it, or
   rather in losing sight of the human in the Divine reality. It is not
   with him, in any distinctive sense, a human power through which we
   merely apprehend God as the one ultimate and absolute Substance and
   Cause; but it is, even in its human appearance, a sort of
   divinity--"not, indeed, the absolute God, but His manifestation in
   spirit and in truth--not the Being of beings, but the God of the human
   race." [149]

   The characteristic error of Cousin seems to consist in a too extreme
   recoil from the subjectivity of Kant. Looking at the great constitutive
   idea of the infinite, in the various phases in which it is found to
   underlie all our mental operations--as, for example, the universal in
   space, the eternal in time--Kant concluded that these were the mere
   forms or categories which the mind, the ego cogitative, imposes upon
   itself. He thus denuded them of objectivity, and thereby, as we have
   seen, contradicted the testimony of consciousness in reason, which
   embraces not only a subject, but an object--which declares the soul not
   only to be conversant with such notions, as regulative forms of its own
   activity, but to be directly and primarily conversant with the reality
   in which they all inhere. Looking at these same notions, Cousin, on the
   other hand, is not content to accept them as intuitively made known to
   the human reason, but he insists upon them as realities apart from the
   human ego, and, indeed, any ego whatever. They were only the forms of
   the human ego with Kant: the ego has nothing to do with them, says
   Cousin; for reason, which expresses or contains them, is impersonal.
   [150] But this is to talk in a language which is to us wholly
   unintelligible; for we can have no conception of reason which is
   unrelated to personality. Apart from the latter element it is a mere
   abstraction, equally unmeaning with the materialistic abstraction of
   law, and equally calculated to play the same pantheistic or atheistic
   part of exalting itself in the place of God. The contents of reason
   are, no doubt, realities altogether apart from the human ego; but how
   they can be known or manifested to us, save as apprehended by that ego,
   seems a puzzle of peculiar hopelessness. The fact appears to be, that
   personality, or the ego, is understood by M. Cousin as something
   subordinate and inferior, with the action of which it is degrading to
   associate reason; and here again he is found somewhat strangely meeting
   the views of the materialistic school most opposed to him.

   Our position is equally opposed to both these extremes. The infinite is
   apprehended by us as a reality in the strongest manner, but then the
   evidence of this reality is directly found in the intuitive
   apprehension of the ego. It is revealed in the rational consciousness,
   and in its revelation sufficiently attests its existence. Our reason
   relates us to the infinite, and lifts us into communion with it. It is
   thus to us the ever-sufficient evidence of the Divine reality; but it
   is itself only a feeble and broken shadow of that reality. It looks
   forth into the invisible, and finds there its living Author; yet it is
   deeply conscious of its own weakness, while conscious of its affinity
   with the Divine Presence which there meets it, and from which it comes.

   This infinite Presence in space and in time is the complement of man's
   spiritual being at all points. It asserts its power in the human mind
   in manifold ways, that can only be accounted for by its truth. Apart
   from its shadow in the intellect, science could not exist: knowledge
   would be a mere perplexed and confused accumulation. This, however,
   brings a unity into all our mental operations. Reason descries an
   infinite meaning everywhere, and science is the creation of such a
   gift. Apart from this reality in the heart life would be vanity. The
   higher glory of eternity could not encompass and strengthen it. It is
   only the truth of the Infinite that gives significance to speculation
   or perseverance to well-doing.

   In natural theology this predicate of the Infinite is at once the most
   consummate and comprehensive that rewards our inquiry, without which
   every induction must come short of the proof of a Divine Existence. It
   gives, as its essential contents, not only all those special attributes
   of eternity, omnipotence, omniscience, of which it is simply the
   generic expression; but, moreover, the unity of these attributes, in
   which the idea of God alone completes itself. For unity is plainly a
   logical condition of infinity; and, manifold as are the indications of
   unity in nature, it may be doubted whether these could give us more
   than a unity of Divine purpose, whereas our conclusion requires a unity
   of Divine Essence. It attains to its full meaning only in the admission
   of one "all-powerful, wise, and good Being, by whom everything exists."

   The special question of the validity of the a priori argument for the
   being of a God here comes before us directly; and although our relation
   to it can scarcely fail to have made itself intelligible to the
   philosophical reader, it may yet deserve from us a special
   consideration.

   The pretension of the a priori argument is the logical evolution or
   demonstration of the truth of the Divine existence from some element or
   datum admitted to be indisputable. In order strictly to maintain its
   character, this element ought to be one ineradicably given in our modes
   of thought--an intellectual point of which we cannot get rid, but which
   we continue to think in the very attempt to think away. Such is our
   notion of infinity; and all a priori reasoning for the being of a God
   will be found to rest on some phase or other of this notion. It errs
   not in its appeal to such fundamental necessities of human thought, but
   in its attempt to construct out of them a logical demonstration of the
   Divine Existence. We will confine ourselves, for the sake of
   illustration, to what is commonly known as the Cartesian [151]
   argument. The argument of Dr Clarke, in so far as it is a priori, lies
   open to the same criticism. This argument, however, as already observed
   in the Introduction, is not strictly a priori, setting out as it does
   from an express fact of observation or of sensible experience. The
   remarkable argument of Mr Gillespie, [152] which, as a specimen of a
   priori speculation, certainly claims to be ranked along with anything
   in British philosophical literature, comes still more directly within
   the scope of our objection.

   We select our statement of the Cartesian argument from the replies to
   the Objections to the Meditations, [153] where it is found in a form
   the most rigidly demonstrative, and which may very well stand as the
   type of all possible a priori argumentation on the subject. The
   following is the proposition to be proved, and the mode of
   demonstration:--

   Proposition.--"The existence of God is known from the consideration of
   His nature alone."

   Demonstration.--"To say that an attribute is contained in the nature,
   or in the concept of a thing, is the same as to say that this attribute
   is true of this thing, and that it may be affirmed to be in it. "

   "But necessary existence is contained in the nature, or in the concept
   of God."

   "Hence it may with truth be said that necessary existence is in God, or
   that God exists."

   This argument, be it observed, sets out from the conception of God, and
   infers, simply on the ground of this conception, the fact of His
   existence. More particularly, it infers this fact, because necessary
   existence is an essential element of the conception of God; that is to
   say, our conception of God, as the all-perfect or the infinite,
   includes this special phase of the infinite, necessary existence;--and
   therefore God exists. The character of the conception is made the proof
   of the fact. This seems to us a fair explication of the argument. We do
   not now dwell upon the paralogism which it may be said to involve in
   starting from the conception of God, which is yet the very thing to be
   found. We would only fix attention upon the inference by which it
   passes from the concept to the reality from the idea to the fact.
   Instead of uniting the soul to objectivity by the very character of its
   affirmation in reason, the Cartesian sets out with the subjective and
   reasons to the objective. The infinite real is with him a logical
   inference from the infinite ideal (apprehended separately)--the
   concrete from the abstract. A purely intellectual necessity is regarded
   as demonstrative of an actual existence. According to our
   representation, on the other hand, the infinite is not apprehended as
   in the mind at all apart from reality, but as a revelation of reality
   from the first--as, in short, not logically but intuitively given. The
   postulate of reason is a reality, and the logical necessity of the
   Cartesian is the mere reflection in the understanding of this
   encompassing reality, which stands face to face with us in reason. In
   the one case, the infinite is apprehended as a fact in the truthful
   mirror of intuition; in the other case, the mind is merely busy with a
   set of abstract ideas, which are nothing else than the shadow
   (reflection) in thought or logical form of the intuitive fact.

   If, with the Cartesian, we take our stand among these abstract ideas,
   we believe that we can never, by any process of proof, reach the
   conclusion at which he aims. The infinite ideal can never logically
   yield the infinite real. Kant's famous criticism of the Cartesian
   argument has, we think, established so much beyond all dispute. He has
   shown, with an acuteness and power of reasoning which it is impossible
   to resist, that this argument, in passing from the abstract to the
   concrete, confounds a logical with a real predicate,--or, in other
   words, stealthily translates a mere relation of thought into a fact of
   existence, which it does not and cannot contain. The following
   illustration, used by Des Cartes, will make this clear. The quotation
   is from his statement in the Principles of the same argument which we
   have already given in the more precise form in which it is found in his
   answers to Objections: "Just as because, for example, the equality of
   its three angles to two right angles is necessarily comprised in the
   idea of a triangle, the mind is firmly persuaded that the three angles
   of a triangle are equal to two right angles; so, from its perceiving
   necessary and eternal existence to be comprised in the idea which it
   has of an all-perfect Being, it ought manifestly to conclude that this
   all-perfect Being exists."

   It is impossible not to see at once that there is a plain fallacy here.
   The idea of a triangle includes the equality of its three angles to two
   right angles; therefore the three angles of a triangle are equal to two
   right angles. This is simply to affirm an identical proposition--that
   proposition being the invariability of the intellectual conception
   expressed by a triangle. The idea of an all-perfect Being includes
   necessary existence; therefore this all -perfect Being exists. This, on
   the contrary, is not simply to affirm, as in the former case, an
   identical proposition, which would have been only to this effect, that
   necessary existence is an essential constituent of the idea of an
   all-perfect Being, but, tacitly and illegitimately, to pass from the
   relation of an intellectual conception to the reality of the thing
   conceived; whereas the only reality that can be given, as in the
   parallel case of the triangle, is the reality of the relations of the
   intellectual conception.

   Kant pursues his argument in the following manner, which may perhaps
   serve to set it more thoroughly before the reader: "If I do away with
   the predicate in an identical judgment, and I retain the subject--that
   is to say, do away with the equality of the three angles to two right
   angles, and yet retain the triangle, or do away with necessary
   existence, and yet retain the idea of an all-perfect Being--a
   contradiction arises. But if I annul the subject together with the
   predicate, then there arises no contradiction, for there is no more
   anything which could be contradicted. To assume a triangle, and yet to
   do away with the three angles of the same, is contradictory; but to do
   away with the triangle together with its three angles is no
   contradiction. It is just the same with the conception of an absolutely
   necessary being. If you do away with the existence of this, you thus do
   away with the thing itself, together with all its predicates (in which
   case there can be no contradiction. . . . God is omnipotent; this is a
   necessary judgment. The omnipotence cannot be done away with if you
   suppose a Divinity--that is, an infinite Being, with the conception of
   which the fact is identical. But if you say, God is not, neither the
   omnipotency, nor any other of His predicates, is then given; because
   they are all annihilated together with the subject, and in this thought
   there is not manifested the least contradiction." [154]

   The Kantian criticism must, we think, be fairly allowed to be
   destructive of the Cartesian demonstration. However a mere abstract
   idea may indicate a corresponding reality (must in fact do so), it can
   never, if we merely hold thereby, constitute a valid proof of it. We
   can never logically pass from the one to the other. Just as in
   perception, if we endeavour to separate the contents therein given, and
   hold merely with the ideal factor--the me--we can never argumentatively
   find the not-me. We can never get out of the subjective circle. But let
   us only acknowledge the intuitive character of the apprehensive act in
   either case--in reason as in sense--and we have already as indisputable
   matter of fact the me and the not-me, the subject and object. The
   infinite, no longer regarded as a mere subjective reflection in the
   understanding--a mere logical necessity--but as intuitively given in
   reason, needs and admits of no further proof of reality than its being
   thus given. It is there--a living Presence, in which alone the finite
   soul at once apprehends itself and the ultimate and absolute Being
   whence it is. So far from depending on demonstration, it is, in this
   view, a fact anterior to all demonstration, and even the very condition
   of that logical thought, which in vain seeks to reach it.

   And in thus abandoning all claim to demonstration, the evidence for the
   being of a God, so far from being weakened, is indeed strengthened. For
   in all our knowledge there is, and can be, no higher warrant for
   reality than the grasp of intuition. What the soul thus holds by
   immediate presentation, is, and must be, its most living
   possession--the source of all its own elaborated notions, and in
   comparison with which these are verily as shadows. And thus, too, it
   deserves to be added, the great truth of the existence of God is only
   preserved as a truth of religion, encompassed with a radiance of
   evidence which only the wilfully blind can fail to see, yet not
   mathematically demonstrated, that they who devoutly seek the light may
   have gladness and reward in its discovery.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [145] Even empiricism may be said to give us, under the form of
   generalisations, a mimicry of the truths which it yet denies.

   [146] This employment of the term reason, to denote the special faculty
   of the supersensible or unconditioned, is very old, although it may be
   true, according to Sir W. Hamilton (Ed. Reid, note A, p. 769), that it
   has only been generally used in this sense since the time of Kant. Its
   justification seems to be simply this, that the highest energy or
   expression of the human mind may very well receive pre-eminently the
   name which is characteristic of its general nature. Certainly, if the
   name is to be appropriated to any special power or faculty, it ought to
   be appropriated to this highest and most aspiring faculty, which brings
   us into communion with the spiritual and the infinite. If such an
   interpretation of reason were kept steadily in view, the supposed
   conflicts between it and faith, which have been so long the bane and
   opprobrium of Theology, would speedily disappear. For thus they would
   be clearly seen to form a unity of power, in which the whole soul,
   intellectually and practically, goes forth towards the truth. In our
   older and best theology this is the view under which reason is
   presented.--Vide HOOKER'S Eccles. Polit., book i. chap. vii. et seq.

   [151] The name of Des Cartes has been especially associated with the a
   priori argument, and to him must undoubtedly be allowed the merit of
   having launched it, as a pregnant problem, into the current of modern
   speculation. The argument, however, in all that it essentially imports,
   is as old as the first dawn of scholasticism, of which it is so genuine
   a product. The germ of it is to be found in the writings of the great
   father of the Scholastic Philosophy (Augustine, 2d chap. De Lib. Arbit.
   ) and in the writings of Anselm and Aquinas. In those of the former it
   is even set forth in a strictly formal and scientific manner, which the
   student may consult as presented in Hagenbach's History of Doctrines,
   vol. i. p. 443 et seq. It is a somewhat curious fact to find Des
   Cartes, who so emphatically stands at the head of our modern free
   inquiry, the patriarch of that speculative spirit which has born such
   strange fruits of intellectual daring, and who himself manifests in his
   Meditations a tone of such intense originality, reverting to a familiar
   doctrine of the expiring scholasticism as one of the most fundamental
   principles of the new philosophical certitude which he aimed to
   establish.

   1838.--The matter is perhaps best of all cleared up by Kant's
   well-known distinction of analytic and synthetic judgments. The
   equality of three angles of a triangle to two right angles is what he
   called an analytic judgment; that is to say, a simple writing out of
   the conception already given in a triangle. The predicate B is already
   in the subject A. Again, existence, as a necessary element of the
   conception, God, is in a similar manner an analytic judgment--a simple
   writing out of the conception for which God already stands. The
   predicate B (existence as a conception) is already in the subject A.
   But to predicate existence as a fact of the subject A, is to pass out
   of the sphere of the conception altogether, and, however true in
   itself, can never be given in the mere conception. The judgment, in
   this case, is no longer analytic, but synthetic; that is to say,
   something is affirmed, which the mere explication of the conception
   does not yield.

DIFFICULTIES REGARDING THE DIVINE WISDOM AND GOODNESS.
     __________________________________________________________________

§ IV.--CHAPTER I.

  STATEMENT OF DIFFICULTIES, ETC.

   WE have already noticed certain "difficulties" that directly meet us in
   unfolding the theistic argument. In carrying up our varied trains of
   induction from the wide province of nature, we encounter facts, which
   not only, on the first view, do not contribute to our argument, but
   seem to stand in obvious contradiction to it.

   These facts do not meet us in the outset, but only as we advance. So
   long as we confine our range of induction to material phenomena, to the
   combinations of inorganic matter, or even of the lower forms of organic
   existence, there is nothing that can be said to interrupt the
   harmonious flow of the theistic evidence. All is order, unbroken by
   check or flaw. There is no room for the conception of imperfection or
   evil.

   We trace certainly, within the domain of matter, the signs of what we
   are apt to call disorder. The planetary system, in some of its
   features, seems to present indications of disturbance. The frame of the
   earth has apparently, in past times, been rent and broken up by mighty
   throes. And there are instances even now of such material convulsions;
   as when the lightning desolates, or the volcano pours its fiery doom
   over surrounding towns and villages, or the earthquake engulfs them
   with sudden terror. But it is only to us, or because we contemplate
   these things in the light of life, that such phenomena assume for a
   moment the appearance of disorder. In themselves--apprehended simply in
   regard either to their causes or their material results--such a term
   has no application to them; for they are merely appropriate issues in
   the great plan of physical development, whereby the constant growth of
   its order and beauty is maintained.

   When, however, we pass beyond material arrangements to those of life in
   its higher forms, we find phenomena which in themselves appear dark and
   contradictory. Pain emerges as a parallel fact with pleasure in
   sensation; death as a parallel fact with life throughout all its range.
   The facts of pain and death are peculiar in this respect, that they
   appear to contradict and nullify the very order amid which they occur:
   they are evil amid the good. It is this conception of evil which, in
   the mere domain of matter, has obviously no place--which constitutes,
   in its manifold forms, the grand difficulty of the Natural Theologian.

   In the sphere of animal life, evil is present in such apparent
   contradictions as we have now mentioned, and especially in the direct
   provision made for the event of these in the existence of animals of
   prey. The joy and life of certain animals are the agony and death of
   others. This arrangement of nature seems to present itself as a
   mal-arrangement.

   In the sphere of human life, evil is especially present--not only in
   the lower physical forms of pain and death, but, moreover, in all the
   forms of sorrow which disturb and vex the human heart, the multiplied
   social evils of our race, and, above all, in the fact of sin, which at
   once intensifies, and in a manner comprehends, every other phase of
   human evil.

   These phenomena, therefore, claim our special examination, in reference
   to the theistic argument. They seem to bear with a show of opposing
   force against it, at least against its full conclusiveness. Their
   reality appears to affect particularly the truth of the Divine wisdom
   and goodness. With these attributes, and eminently with the latter, the
   fact of evil comes in conflict. It is, we formerly saw, in immediate
   opposition to the good in sensation that the evil first emerges; but
   evil, being also in its very conception disorder, is no less truly
   opposed to wisdom than to goodness.

   It now remains for us, therefore, to obviate the difficulties thence
   arising to our argument. The attributes of Divine wisdom and goodness,
   while suffering under the partial shadow of such points of darkness,
   may yet be found, from a thorough review of the whole subject and field
   of evidence before us, to come forth into even a purer and more
   glorious lustre than if there had been no shadow to dissipate--no evil
   to alleviate.
     __________________________________________________________________

§ IV.--CHAPTER II.

  GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

   BEFORE entering on the special examination of the difficulties before
   us, it may help to clear our way, and throw some light around it, to
   draw attention to certain general considerations bearing on the
   subject.

   The first of these arises from the fact, already more than once
   insisted upon, that phenomena of evil are truly of an exceptional
   character: they come before us as exceptions to general order and
   prevailing good. While, therefore, they appear formidable difficulties
   when viewed by themselves, it is not yet by themselves, but as mere
   spots of darkness in an otherwise fair and bright picture, that they
   can fairly claim to be regarded. Let them be considered, in the fullest
   sense, obstacles in the way of the complete theistic
   inference--anomalies demanding explanation; they have yet no claim to
   set aside that inference, in virtue of their mere existence. An
   indefinite array of facts bears witness to the Divine wisdom and
   goodness with an accumulating force of evidence which is irresistible.
   This evidence is entitled to hold good its place for what it is worth,
   notwithstanding that there is a certain amount of what appears
   counter-evidence. Let both go into court, and be judged according to
   their respective value; but it were surely a strange injustice that the
   mere presence of certain phenomena appearing to form negative evidence
   should be held, per se, to dispose of the whole array of positive
   evidence. It were a strange injustice to deny that any valid inference
   of corresponding qualities in an artist can be founded on the general
   excellence, the harmonious skill, displayed by his work, because it may
   contain what may seem to us imperfections. And yet this is really the
   injustice which has been perpetrated, as with a show of superior
   acuteness, [155] against the inductive argument for the Divine wisdom
   and beneficence. It has been urged, for example, that the apparent
   imperfections of nature as much warrant a negative, as its order a
   positive, conclusion in reference to the Divine wisdom. This is
   imagined to be a peculiar hit of logic, which completely demolishes the
   theistic induction! Yet surely it is impossible to conceive a graver
   perversion of logic. For even admitting the fact of such imperfections
   in nature as are supposed, which may be entirely disputed, all that
   logic can demand is, that such phenomena shall not be rejected, and
   held as of no account in the theistic evidence. In fairness, they must
   receive a hearing before the conclusion is pronounced. The presumptions
   of an opposite character which they involve must be weighed; but that
   certain apparent anomalies here and there, which, the more they are
   examined, the less they are seen to be anomalies, must be allowed to
   set aside the otherwise uniform testimony of nature, is too absurdly
   illogical a pretension to deserve even the notice we have given it.

   Even so as to those more serious aspects of misery which exist in human
   life. The very utmost that can be demanded is, that they be recognised
   as difficulties in the way of the complete theistic inference. It is
   certainly puzzling that the works of a good Being should be in any
   respect marred by unhappiness. Yet the partial unhappiness cannot for a
   moment be entitled to set aside the prevailing happiness. On any fair
   principle of evidence, we must admit the good for what it truly is--the
   rule of nature; and the evil for what it no less truly is--only the
   exception. In this, as it appears to us, the whole question at this
   stage is summed up, and we willingly leave the sceptic on either horn
   of the dilemma he may choose; namely, either to deny that happiness is
   the rule of creation (a denial from which his philosophic insouciance
   would especially shrink), or to admit pro tanto the validity of the
   inference founded upon the rule, and to join us in the search of
   whatever explanation the exceptions may admit of.

   And this leads us to the only other preliminary consideration which
   seems to demand attention. In reviewing the phenomena of creation, we
   are to bear in mind that we only see part of a great plan in progress.
   We cannot, in the nature of the case, see more. But if we could see the
   whole plan in its extended development, many things that now seem to us
   exceptional and contradictory might lose this character altogether, and
   even expand into special means of advance in the ever-enlarging display
   of the Divine beneficence. The mystery which everywhere encompasses our
   finite sphere of observation, may only conceal from us the wisdom and
   the goodness that are really present in many phenomena where we cannot
   even trace them. The limitation of our faculties is thus recognised as
   in some manner explanatory of the difficulties that meet us in regard
   to our subject; and it is quite validly so held in a general sense. It
   has been urged, indeed, in the same hostile spirit of reasoning,
   already noticed, that if the limitation of our faculties is to be
   called into account so far, it must be admitted much farther. It ought
   truly to deter us from pronouncing any theistic judgment at all as to
   creation--an assertion which is really tantamount to saying that we
   ought to reject a fact because we are not able to perceive all the
   relations of that fact. We are not to admit that God is good, because
   we cannot understand the whole nature and bearing of His goodness. "We
   are to refuse to believe what we see and know, because there are
   certain things we do not see and cannot know. The finite cannot
   understand the infinite; therefore it must pause in mere dumb
   perplexity, and not say anything, nor believe anything. Reason
   instinctively recoils from such an assertion. It at once rejects such a
   mere syllogistic cavil. With a higher and truer logic, it accepts the
   good, although it may not comprehend all its modes of operation.
   Looking out from the veil which covers its limited vision, it perceives
   and acknowledges the lustre of beneficence all around it, and it only
   pauses where shadows seem to cover that lustre. We do not deny the
   light of the sun because shadows here and there intercept that light:
   nay, there are spots, we know, in the very solar brightness itself; but
   this does not prevent us day by day, as we pass into its presence,
   confessing the lustre of beauty and happiness that it sheds about our
   path.

   We rightly allow, therefore, the theistic inference on its positive
   side, while we pause before those negative facts that force themselves
   upon us. We validly pause in the one case, and not in the other, on the
   broad ground that, in the one case, the immediate conclusion is
   correspondent to our rational instincts, and in the other it is
   repellent to those instincts. Truly speaking, it is only in the latter
   case that the region of ignorance and mystery begins. It is only the
   evil that is utterly unintelligible. It is only in reference to the
   evil that the limitation of our faculties is displayed in absolute
   helplessness. Rightly, therefore, on every principle of reason, we call
   in this limitation of our faculties as demanding a suspense of judgment
   in regard to the evil, and not in regard to the good. In the one case
   reason is satisfied: it rests in the good, as sympathetic with it, and
   intelligible to it. From the evil, on the contrary, it retreats, as
   utterly perplexing; and we say, in such a case, with a justice which
   commends itself to every heart, that if we knew more--if our faculties
   were more competent--we might understand what is now so dark. If our
   vision were enlarged, we might perceive that what seems so anomalous
   and evil is not really so. For we are but the creatures of a day; and
   those darkened characters which our feeble sight cannot read, may yet,
   to a higher sight, be luminous with Divine light. The mystery which we
   cannot explain, may disappear on a wider horizon of knowledge. Could we
   see the end from the beginning, it may be best as it is, after all. The
   complications which now yield us no meaning, or one at which we only
   gaze with awe, may expand into issues of beneficence that will gladden
   the angels, when the great scheme is complete, and the glory of final
   victory is poured backwards through all its darkened perplexities and
   most deeply-lying shadows.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [155] "If the celebrated argument of design is to hold good as evidence
   in favour, it must hold equally good as evidence against the wisdom and
   beneficence of the Creator;--a startling proposition, and one, we
   believe, never made before, but one from which logic has no escape.
   When you point to the perfection of organisations as evidence of
   wisdom, and to their manifold enjoyments as evidence of goodness, you
   force the reflective mind to think of the imperfections and the misery
   so abundantly displayed. When you take your relative good for the
   absolute good, you must equally accept your relative evil for the
   absolute evil. Now this is shocking; the mind refuses to accept such a
   conception, and would be plunged in despair, did it not learn that
   Wisdom, Goodness, Evil, are but relative terms, and pertain to our
   human finite conditions, not to the Infinite. Yet, if men will persist
   in measuring the Infinite according to their finite standard, they must
   do so in the one case as in the other. Theologians usually escape from
   the dilemma by saying, when any case of manifest evil is propounded,
   God's ways are inscrutable;' and they are right. But if inscrutable in
   one direction, inscrutable in all. We do not understand evil, nor do we
   understand good; the finite cannot understand the Infinite." Leader,
   No. 116, July 12, 1852. We present this as a specimen of our most
   recent antitheistic logic. The passage, as it proceeds, is not without
   an air of speciousness, which is yet, as it appears to us, only derived
   from a perversion of the assumption against which it is directed. It is
   not true, for example, that the Theologian takes the relative good
   which he finds in nature as equivalent to absolute good. So far is this
   from being the case, that the whole question as to the theistic
   significance of evil only occurs from the admission that the good in
   nature is relative. Were it absolute, or assumed to be absolute, there
   would and could be no such question. The fact is, that the argument of
   design, according to its only right interpretation, and as abundantly
   evident from the whole course of our previous evidence, does not deal
   with the absolute in any sense at all. Its sole aim is to verify the
   theistic idea, as revealed in nature. It does not, therefore, affect to
   reach, far less to understand, the Infinite. It does profess, however,
   to determine comprehensively according to their full character the
   theistic contents given in nature; and its conclusion certainly is that
   wisdom and goodness are among their number. Looking with an open glance
   upon creation, the Theologian has the evidence of wisdom and goodness
   forced upon him, and by the laws of his rational constitution he cannot
   fail to carry up these attributes of creation to the Creator. But if
   you do this, says the sceptic, you are equally bound to carry up to the
   same source the opposite attributes of "imperfection and misery so
   abundantly displayed" in creation. Yes, bound to carry them up in the
   shape of negative presumptions--but this is all. And this is really
   what the Theologian does, and these negative presumptions are just the
   difficulties with which he has to deal. The force of these difficulties
   may be such as to leave the conclusion of absolute goodness uncertain
   on the mere sphere of nature, this conclusion being only perfected in
   the rational intuition of the Infinite; but it cannot surely be
   maintained to be such as to leave the fact of goodness in the Deity,
   even on this sphere, in any degree uncertain.

§ IV.--CHAPTER III.

  SPECIAL EXAMINATION OF DIFFICULTIES PHYSICAL PAIN AND DEATH.

   WE have already seen what are the first difficulties which meet us in
   the course of our theistic induction. In the region of sentient
   existence, which brings us into the presence of Divine Goodness, we
   meet, in immediate connection with the phenomena of pleasure, the
   phenomena of pain; and death we find ceaselessly alternating with life.
   In examining these difficulties, we shall regard them in their widest
   manifestation throughout the sphere of animal being. Any special
   reference that they may have to man will be sufficiently considered
   under those higher forms of evil that peculiarly belong to him.

   The first thing to be said of physical pain is what we have already
   urged. [156] The issue of the sensitive frame, according to its regular
   and harmonious action, is pleasure. In health and vigour--or, in other
   words, when not interfered with--it gives forth pleasure. There is no
   part of the system whose direct appointed action is pain. Pain, in
   short, is not the production of the sentient organism in the same sense
   as pleasure is. It is something which attacks the organism, or is
   superinduced upon it; not something which springs directly and
   necessarily out of it. It is the exception--pleasure is the rule.

   This is a truly important consideration, which no amount of ingenious
   sophistry can altogether turn aside. Its importance may be recognised
   from the reflection, that if the sensitive organism had been quite
   differently constituted, so that its natural evolution, its very growth
   and ordinary action, had been painful, and pleasure been merely its
   accident, as pain now is--we do not see, in such a case, how the Divine
   wisdom and benevolence could have been vindicated. Imperfection and
   malevolence would then certainly have appeared the more appropriate
   inference from nature. Or even had the relation of the two facts,
   although not exactly inverted, been altered, so that pain asserted
   itself to be as much a fact in sensitive life as pleasure--to arise as
   immediately out of its constitution--the theistic inference would have
   been thereby so obscured as to have become powerless for conviction or
   consolation. The fact that, according to undeniable design, and equally
   undeniable reality, pleasure is the normal expression of sensation,
   while pain is merely its liability, is, therefore, of the greatest
   significance for our subject, and on no account to be lost sight of.

   But, it will be said, could not this liability have been averted? Could
   not God have so constituted the sensitive organism that it should never
   have issued in pain--that its free harmonious action should not only
   have been pleasure, but that it should never have been interfered with?
   Might not the sensitive instrument have been so constructed that it
   should not only send forth, as it does, the music of happiness, but
   that the discord of pain should never have proceeded from it? Would not
   the power, wisdom, and goodness of God have been thus unimpeachably
   conspicuous? Now, of course, it is undeniable that, if God had so
   willed, there would have been no pain in the world; but we are by no
   means so sure of the conclusion implied in this. A very different
   conclusion, indeed, seems quite as likely. For is it not the very same
   condition on which pain is contingent that yields pleasure in so much
   abundance? Is it not the very same nervous susceptibility which gives
   forth, as its normal play, the sense of enjoyment--that gives forth, as
   its abnormal play, the sense of pain? Is it not the very same medium
   which overflows with gladness that may be even invaded to madness?
   Supposing the organism had been made incapable of pain, how do we know
   that it would have retained its capacity of pleasure? Supposing it had
   been so constituted as not to have absolutely excluded the force of
   disease, how do we know that it could have owned the spring or felt the
   joy of health? We put the question thus, because we really do not know,
   and cannot know. We may, perhaps, imagine the possibility of a
   susceptibility to pleasure, without a corresponding susceptibility to
   pain; but, so far as we can see, they are inseparable. A wholly
   different constitution, placed in wholly different circumstances, might
   have possessed the one without the other. But this is an utterly idle
   question for us to entertain; for, after all (for aught we can tell),
   such a constitution, in such circumstances, might not have been nearly
   so good as the present. We cannot say it would. Respecting a matter
   altogether beyond the sphere of our knowledge, we have no means of
   reaching a conclusion. Every such conjecture, therefore, is entirely
   out of place. Looking at the fact of things, the only conclusion we can
   form on the subject is, that susceptibility to pleasure and
   susceptibility to pain are correlative and proportional. The more
   highly refined and exalted the organism, and the more exquisite its
   issues of pleasure, the more exquisite also is its liability to
   suffering. Yet, as we formerly saw, and as is highly significant in the
   actual arrangements of creation, the higher and more richly susceptible
   the organisms, the more carefully defended are they. The more life
   becomes intensified in nobler creations, the more carefully is its
   freight of happiness secured against spoliation, if, when it is
   spoiled, there be a more utter and painful waste.

   Upon the whole, then, it seems that physical pain, while a mere
   liability of the nervous tissue, whose regular and healthful action is
   pleasure, is yet apparently an inherent liability of the same,--so
   that, without the contingency of pain, we could not have had the fact
   of pleasure; and, apart from this fact, we would have been without the
   inference of the Divine goodness; for this inference only rests on the
   presence of happiness in the creation as its foundation. It is only
   within the sphere of sensitive enjoyment that the light of creative
   love dawns upon us; and if it be within this sphere also that a slight
   darkness first tinges our inductive horizon, it is yet surely better to
   have the light with the faint darkness than no light at all.

   We may further advert, even in this lower sphere, to the strange
   relation of affinity between pleasure and pain. So inlaid is the former
   in the sensitive organism as its appropriate condition, that while that
   organism cannot resist the contact of the latter, it yet often turns it
   into a mean of higher pleasure. The temporary suffering is transmuted
   into a sweeter joy. There is, in truth, a general character of balance
   and alternation in the sensitive frame. Its life is a continual
   fluctuation; and if the nervous chords were never painfully affected,
   we do not know how they might lose in tone and freshness. Or, if this
   be saying too much, it is yet undeniable that sensitive enjoyment is
   dependent upon an interchange of affection more and less pleasurable--a
   succession of more easy and less easy experiences; and, under this
   capacity of reaction, even the invading pain, as we have said, becomes
   the means of higher pleasure; and the Divine wisdom and goodness are
   beheld asserting themselves by the very presence of apparent disorder
   and evil.

   The fact of death, in the general animal kingdom, will be found still
   more readily than that of pain to yield a consistent theistic
   interpretation. As the goodness of God is only manifest in the display
   of happy sentient existence, it is obvious that this goodness will be
   more manifest the more it is beheld communicating life and happiness.
   The more multiplied and diversified sentient being, the more abundant
   the evidence of Divine beneficence. Every fresh life, every new birth
   of breathing and beautiful organisation, is a renewed testimony to the
   Divine fulness and love.

   It is clear, then, that if there had been no such thing as death in the
   animal creation, this enjoyment could only have been imparted within a
   comparatively very limited extent. Animal fecundity must have been
   restrained within comparatively infinitesimal bounds, and animal life
   consequently have been deficient in the copiousness, variety, and
   beauty of happiness which it now exhibits. There could have been in
   such a case no succession of races, no giving place of inferior to
   higher and more complex organisms, and therefore no such extended
   display of Divine wisdom as geology reveals. Numerous creatures, who
   have lived their brief day of joy, could never have been. In the
   absence, then, of the apparent exception to the Divine wisdom and
   goodness, we could not have had the same abundant manifestations of
   these attributes, which seems very much tantamount to a satisfactory
   proof that the apparent is not a real exception. That which seems at
   first to form an obstacle in the way of the theistic inference, is
   found to issue in a wider and more extended basis for it. As we look at
   the mere fact of death by itself, it seems for a moment as if there
   were a flaw in the all-wise and beneficent arrangements of the world;
   but, as we look a little more steadily, we see how, in the animal as in
   the vegetable kingdom, life springs from death; how the extinction of
   one generation, or it may be race, is the rise of others, with equal
   and perhaps more exalted powers of enjoyment. Death, in this simply
   organic view, is so far from approving itself an irregularity, or in
   any true sense an evil, that it is the obvious condition of organic
   growth and progress altogether. It is the simple mode by which life
   continues and advances through its endless phases, taking to itself
   from every apparent pause a richer strength, and rising from every
   apparent fall into finer and nobler forms. The Divine wisdom,
   therefore, may be said to be illustrated instead of obscured by its
   contemplation, and the Divine beneficence to shine with a fuller and
   brighter light in its presence.

   If we add to these considerations the fact that throughout the brute
   creation death is, in whatever form, a destiny towards which it blindly
   tends, and which, for the most part, overtakes it with a swift
   decision, which gives but a minimum of pain, we will have still greater
   reason to rest in such a conclusion. Even in the article of death, the
   brute does not know that it is dying, or at least has no contemplative
   realisation of the fact, which is what gives all its bitterness to
   death in man's special case. The life which has sported itself in
   joyful hours, or days, or years, expires in the brief pang of a moment.
   Here, as everywhere, the measure of pain is found to be strictly
   economised, while the measure of life and its enjoyments is poured
   forth with a profuse hand.

   Similar considerations serve to obviate the special difficulty which
   has been felt to arise from the system of prey in the animal creation.
   If that system had not existed, it is plain that an immense restraint
   comparatively must have been laid on animal fecundity and enjoyment. If
   some animals had not been destined to live on others, many animals
   could never have lived at all. Merely vegetable produce could not have
   sustained animal life in anything like its present fulness and
   diversity. A change in this one respect would have implied a change in
   the whole existing relations of the vegetable and animal kingdoms,
   which we have no reason to suppose would have been a better
   arrangement, while even such a change could not have obviated the
   destruction of certain animals by others. For the very movements of the
   larger animals carry with them death to insect myriads. The ox crushes
   them with its feet as it pastures, and in many forms devours them
   within the folds of the green leaf. While there is something,
   therefore, in the system of prey, in certain of its manifestations,
   regarded by themselves, which seems to shock our sense of the Divine
   goodness, when we enlarge our view we perceive that these
   manifestations are only to some extent special modes of a general law
   of destruction, which in other forms we do not feel to be harsh and
   repellent; and that, even if they repelled us more than they do, they
   are yet the condition of that extended and overflowing presence of life
   which we everywhere behold. The question, indeed, essentially comes to
   be of this kind, whether the display of goodness would have been less
   affected by the comparatively limited presence of life, than by the
   special amount of pain involved in the system of prey? The question is
   one that may be fairly left to the settlement which nature has given of
   it.

   And all this receives confirmation from special features in the system
   of prey which it is well not to overlook; from the fact, for example,
   that the predatory animal kills before it devours, and especially from
   the fact that it commonly seizes by instinct on the most vital part,
   where death is most suddenly and easily inflicted.

   We may then fairly conclude, upon the whole, that the circumstance of
   organic extinction does not in any degree affect the inference of the
   Divine wisdom and goodness. It is rather a means towards their further
   and grander display. There is, as it were, a partial hiding of the
   Divine character in the shadow of death thrown upon the picture, but it
   is only for the purpose of opening up behind the partial shadow a more
   extended and brighter display of that character, a more abundant and
   richer manifestation of it.

IV. CHAPTER IV.

  SPECIAL EXAMINATION CONTINUED SORROW.

   IT is, however, in the sphere of human life that evil appears in its
   most marked and difficult forms. It is only here, indeed, that evil, in
   the peculiar and emphatic sense in which we commonly use the term, is
   found at all. It is here that it assumes at once a malignity which
   defies palliation, and a darkness which is still profound when we have
   thrown upon it the clearest light which nature or even revelation
   supplies.

   This mystery of evil in humanity from the first assumes all its special
   hatefulness and darkness from the element of moral corruption which
   mingles in it, and which, in all its forms, it more or less indicates.
   If it were not this moral element, there would remain nothing peculiar,
   save its dignity, in human evil. It is the presence of a deeper shadow
   lying within the varied shades which chequer human life, that alone
   gives to them all their special mournfulness, and constitutes that
   master-problem before which speculation retires baffled, and the heart
   stands in awe. It is important now to bring this into view, because,
   while we trust to be able to show various considerations tending to
   mitigate the common ills of our race, and even to transmute them into
   good, we would yet have it to be seen, from the outset, that these
   ills--deriving as they do their worst hue from that deeper evil which
   lies behind--at the same time find in it their highest explanation. The
   fact of sin, if it intensifies the picture of human suffering, at the
   same time serves to account for it. The lesser, and, as it were,
   accessory evils, become intelligible in the greater. While striving to
   carry the light of special explanation along with us, it is,
   accordingly, of some consequence to see that, in this darker difficulty
   of sin, all the lower difficulties finally merge. To it they are easily
   pushed back. In this grand enigma all other enigmas of human life
   gather up and concentrate themselves. If the problem, therefore,
   acquires only a more inexplicable character in the end, it is yet
   reduced to a single point, from the very intensity of whose mystery a
   clearer explanation falls upon its lower levels.

   Under what is commonly meant by sorrow in the widest sense, we may sum
   up the different expressions of human evil. How pervading a presence
   sorrow is, it is needless to say. There is no heart which it has not
   touched, there is no life which it has not darkened. In one form or
   another it is all around us, and its shadow traces all earthly joy. Its
   presence is not only to be measured by its outward manifestation; it
   lies deep in the soul of many whose brow may yet be clear. It cuts into
   many a heart which gives no sign of bleeding. Of a certain great man,
   [157] who has written many fine things about sorrow, it is said that,
   when he lost his son, no one could read in his face any sign of
   peculiar emotion; but it was observed that he "worked harder than
   ever." In this way he sought to stay the bursting fountain of bereaved
   feeling; and so free and commanding, and, it may be added withal, so
   cold a nature, no doubt succeeded in his attempt. Yet there are also
   those who, though they never any more show it, mourn inwardly with a
   keenness only the more intense that it lacerates in secret. There are
   those who bear their sorrow, a secret presence of unrest only the more
   bitter that it finds no expression, and seeks no sympathy. It lurks
   behind many a smile, and covers itself over with frequent brightness.

   Now it is certainly at first a very perplexing question why it should
   be so--why human life should be thus largely traced and embittered by
   sorrow. This life is no doubt also full of joy,--more full of joy, we
   must hold, after all, than sorrow. And upon this fact of enjoyment, in
   the emotional as in the lower sensational sphere--a fact so diffused
   and pervading as to be from its very nature less susceptible of
   analysis and exhibition than the contrary fact--we based our theistic
   inference. Yet it must be admitted that we have here, in this
   widespread reality of sorrow, a peculiar difficulty in the way of that
   inference.

   This difficulty we might to some extent obviate, on the same grounds as
   those set forth in the previous chapter. It is the same emotional
   susceptibility which renders us at once capable of joy and of sorrow.
   The same source of feeling in the breasts of parents, which finds such
   gratification in the health and prosperity of their children, overflows
   with such bitterness for their suffering or death; the same capacity
   which makes success, or honour, or fame, so pleasurable, makes also
   misfortune, contempt, or disgrace so grievous. If we wanted the
   capacity of sorrow, we do not know that we could have the capacity of
   joy. But certainly, this subjective contingency of pain and pleasure,
   of sorrow and joy, does not explain in either case the actual amount of
   the evil or negative element. We are led, therefore, to seek for some
   higher means of explanation as to the prevalence of suffering in human
   life. The following considerations may serve to throw some measure of
   light upon the subject.

   Man comes into the world a being of mixed passions and affections. The
   infant that smiles so placidly on its mother's breast contains in it,
   with the capacity of indefinite spiritual improvement, the seeds of
   selfish development, which would grow, if unhindered, into all
   inordinate forms of lust and unhappiness. Human life, therefore, needs
   to be beset with agencies fitted to check the one and to stimulate the
   other. And of all these agencies, suffering is undoubtedly one of the
   most effectual, one of the most powerful for the promotion of moral
   culture. It is true that men may suffer much, and yet be little
   bettered--nay, that suffering, in its baser and more ordinary forms,
   may tend to nurture a soul in wickedness rather than in goodness; but
   it is nevertheless a truth of the most undeniable and manifest
   character, that sorrow, in all its higher forms, is a Divine discipline
   of the most precious and signally beneficial kind. It brings the soul
   into contact with ennobling influences from a higher region of
   spiritual life than surrounds it here. It awakens in it more directly
   than anything else the consciousness of the infinite, and calls forth
   in it more energetically than anything else that quick sympathy with
   the lofty and the pure, and that ardent aspiration after the good,
   which are the most constant and unfailing springs of happiness on
   earth. The weeping of the night is thus turned into the joy of the
   morning. The soul that may have lain under the deepest shadow, rises to
   stronger and more beautiful altitudes of virtue. Heaven has been about
   it in its sorrow, and it comes forth brighter from its converse with
   darkness, and better and happier from its dwelling in the "house of
   mourning." Faith guides it henceforth with a firmer step, and Hope
   cheers it by a steadier light, and Love sustains it with a more
   enduring fervour. Patience only grows in the valley of suffering, and
   humility is only purified by the fire of trial. [158]

   Nor does sorrow only lift the soul into a higher region of spiritual
   excellence for its own strengthening and improvement, but it arouses as
   nothing else does its activities for the good of others. It not only
   opens up heaven to us, but it sheds a new interest upon earth, and a
   glory falls from under its veil on the lowliest lot of man. All life
   becomes sacred to it--all men are brethren to its purged and softened
   vision. It is the rich fountain that feeds in us the well of sympathy.
   It is the strong passion that kindles in us the holy rage of
   philanthropy. Nature assumes a lovelier aspect, and is luminous with a
   diviner meaning, to the gaze of sorrow. It is--strange as it may
   be--the mirror in which man sees most deeply into truth and beauty in
   all their relations; so that whatever may be the perplexity of its
   presence in human life, regarded from a mere intellectual point of
   view, it is practically so great and comprehensive an agency of good,
   operating withal so subtly and silently in numerous hearts, that
   humanity has cause to bless its presence and be grateful for its work.
   The man who knows not its consecrating power is a loser in far more
   respects than he can possibly be a gainer. He may be free from its
   painful lessons, but he misses therewith the wisdom and the wellbeing
   that only comes from such lessons.


   "He that lacks time to mourn, lacks time to mend:

   Eternity mourns that. 'Tis an ill cure

   For life's worst ills to have no time to feel them.

   Where sorrow's held intrusive, and turned out,

   There wisdom will not enter, nor true power,

   Nor aught that dignifies humanity." [159]

   The value of sorrow, as a beneficial element of spiritual discipline in
   human life, it is interesting to remark, has received very special and
   emphatic recognition in our modern literature. The comprehensive types
   of ethical truth which Christianity first revealed would now seem to be
   passing into freer literary currency, and asserting a more pervading
   power. The worth and beauty of earnestness, sympathy, and patience--the
   scorn of the false, and the love of the honest and brave--the many
   forms of manly and womanly excellence which only spring in their full
   vigour from "the divine depths of sorrow"--meet us everywhere in the
   ideal pictures of the novelist and the impassioned strain of the poet.
   Looking on life with a nobler or at least more comprehensive spiritual
   insight than heretofore, literature does homage to the blessed function
   of sorrow; and while it gathers to itself the strength which comes from
   it, labours with a rare devotion to remedy all its baser sources, and
   to stanch its most bleeding wounds.

   We are of course aware, in all that we have been saying, that the mere
   notion of such a disciplinary or remedial function as is exercised by
   suffering, suggests a ready answer to the course of argument we have
   rested on it. Why was man, it may be asked, so constituted as to need
   all this discipline? Is not this the real point with which the theistic
   argument requires to deal--the fact of man being found so morally
   imperfect as to need so largely as he does the hard and bitter
   education of sorrow? This obviously points in the last relation to that
   deeper aspect of our subject that awaits us; yet a few remarks seem
   here to deserve attention.

   All spiritual life, in its very conception, implies an education or
   discipline. Virtue only realises its meaning in trial. It is no doubt
   true that we can conceive a discipline merely from one degree of good
   to another--that we can conceive spiritual life flourishing in its most
   exalted forms without any background of evil whereon to reflect its
   excellence; yet it must be also admitted that in the very fact of trial
   there lies the possibility of failure--of a sinking below the good, as
   well as a rising to higher measures of it. In the simple fact of moral
   action there lies the contingency of wrong action, and of all that
   moral imperfection that actually exists in the world.

   Nay, it is not to be denied (to take a further view of the subject,
   which must yet be very cautiously ventured on) that even the
   realisation of the evil--the possibility of failure become a
   fact--bears in it something of good of which we cannot otherwise very
   well conceive. The very presence of moral evil calls forth peculiar
   phases of virtue--a richer and more various fulness of moral
   excellence. We are far from saying that this serves in the remotest
   degree to explain the evil. No view could be further from our whole
   mode of thought than this, which strikes its root deep in an abyss of
   pantheism. We are not now dealing with the final explanation of the
   fact, only pointing out that it is not utterly unassociated with good.
   Good even seems to spring from it. The virtue which is a victory over
   evil, a hard-earned triumph against foes that have lain in wait for it
   all along its path, seems a nobler thing than the virtue which has
   never been so proved. From the very bitterness of the culture springs
   the precious ripeness of the fruit. This does not certainly explain the
   evil, but it is at once significant and cheering to find that its
   presence thus calls forth a more enduring and exalted good.

§ IV.--CHAPTER V.

  SPECIAL EXAMINATION CONTINUED--SOCIAL EVILS.

   THE survey of human life, in its social aspects--in its aggregate
   character of communities and nations--presents perhaps more to perplex
   the contemplative mind than any other view of it. The disorders which
   meet us in such a survey are so numerous, and many of them of such
   appalling magnitude, that even the most devout have been sometimes led
   to ask themselves whether, after all, human history can be considered
   as a development of Divine wisdom and goodness. The evils of
   oppression, of miserable poverty, of social degradation in all its
   shapes, so cover with their dark shadows the historical picture, that
   the epical and beneficent lights of it seem often entirely obscured.
   And even at this better and brighter stage of the world's progress, and
   in such a land as our own, where the higher social influences may be
   supposed working as actively at least as anywhere else, how much is
   there to sadden and bewilder the view! To any man in whom the faculties
   of heart and soul are full, who has a mind to see, and a bosom to be
   touched with the miseries around him, and upon whom has come even some
   dim sense of the infinite capacities and issues of all human life, it
   is certainly a most mournful and perplexing contemplation, that, with
   advancing civilisation, and such vast and ever-strengthening resources
   of science and art and wealth, there should remain so black and fearful
   a foil to the brightness,--that by the side of all this glittering
   increase there should harbour such dreadful sickening masses of human
   deterioration and suffering.

   Sad as are the social evils which thus force themselves upon us,
   whether in the view of the past or the present, a few considerations
   will perhaps serve--so far as our subject is concerned--to obviate the
   difficulties that may be felt to arise from them.

   And first of all, we must not overlook the conviction which, shaken as
   it may be in certain moods, never fails to return to the contemplative
   mind, that, under whatever appearances to the contrary, the collective
   life of mankind in history yet asserts itself to be "an immutable moral
   order, constituted by Divine wisdom." [160] The assurance "that there
   is an eternal order in the government of the world, to which all might
   and power are to become, and do become, subservient; that truth,
   justice, wisdom, and moderation, are sure to triumph" [161] --this
   assurance, which is apt to falter while the gaze dwells on the mere
   imperfections of the picture, comes back with a clear force on its more
   intelligent survey. Divine wisdom and goodness are recognised as
   governing the world, and as drawing forth from all its disorders and
   miseries, hopeless as they may sometimes seem, mighty and harmonious
   issues of happiness. This is not a conclusion merely imported from
   Christian teaching, and held as a matter of faith, however Christianity
   may have shed illumination on it; but it is really a conclusion, upon
   the whole, vindicating itself upon the facts of the case, and becoming
   more clear as these facts develop themselves to the historical student.

   But not only does the theistic inference thus assert itself even in the
   face of the difficulties that beset it; these difficulties are found on
   examination somewhat to clear away. It is felt especially, and from the
   very lowest point of view, that the worst of the social evils from
   which man has suffered in the past, or still suffers, are not in any
   sense to be regarded as a part of the Divine constitution of the world,
   but really infringements thereof, taking their rise in the invasion of
   that constitution by man's impious selfishness. The misrule, and the
   servile and unhappy bondage of mind and body, of which so many are the
   victims, are felt to arise, not from the Divine appointment, but from
   the direct violation and contempt of it. This view, if it does not
   liberate us from the problem, yet throws it back here also upon that
   last aspect of it, whose consideration awaits us. The question comes to
   be one not regarding the consequent evils, fearful as they may be, but
   regarding the primary evil in which they originate--regarding, in
   short, the fact or possibility of man's selfishness opposing itself to
   the Divine order. Here, as elsewhere, this becomes the ultimate and
   comprehensive difficulty into which the others run up, and in which
   they find their explanation.

   It is further to be remembered, that many of the phenomena of social
   life, which, in their aggravated form, must be regarded as evils, are
   merely the negative side of that general condition upon which the whole
   advance, and even the very existence, of civilisation depend. The
   inequality of social advantage, and the consequently partial
   distribution of material and intellectual good, even to the extreme
   disproportion we observe in such a country as our own, are
   unquestionably, in their spring, the mere results of that inequality of
   endowment, without which we cannot conceive human improvement to
   proceed at all. Not that we would be supposed to imply that any
   national life is to be considered as furnishing an example of the
   necessary, or, in other words, divinely constituted relations of
   poverty and wealth. Par from it. It were, we apprehend, a poor faith
   that did not cherish some higher solution of the social problem than
   has yet been anywhere exemplified. The existing extremes of social
   wretchedness and social grandeur are certainly not the appointments of
   Divine order, but the disarrangements of human selfishness. And it is
   only such a faith that could sustain the philanthropist in his labour
   of earnestness, or his hopes of a higher future of national well-being.
   Yet that a certain inequality of social condition, directly springing
   from inequality of personal endowment, is the law of human progress,
   and therefore the appointment of Divine wisdom, is not to be doubted;
   and while we contemplate the serious evils that have taken indirectly
   their rise in this, we are equally bound to regard the general
   advancement, the vastly increasing social well-being, that, upon the
   whole, have flowed from it. Social equality--which, as the presumed
   security against oppression and poverty, and all the characteristic
   ills of civilisation, has been the lauded dream of political
   enthusiasts--is not only no part of the Divine constitution of the
   world, but we have no reason to suppose that it would fulfil the ends
   of "political justice" and happiness that have been attributed to it;
   we have every reason, indeed, to believe the contrary. [162]

   Here, therefore, it will be seen that the question comes to be really
   one as to the wisdom and goodness shown in the general plan of such a
   world as ours at all,--a world whose essential character is that of
   development. For inequality would seem to be the condition of
   development; while, again, the evils we speak of are obviously
   contingent upon this inequality. And in this point of view, so far as
   we are capable in any degree of rising to it, it will perhaps be
   admitted that progress, with all its attendant evils, is yet a better
   and nobler thing than anything else we can well imagine. [163]

   And while we are thus, by enlarging our view, enabled to see in many of
   the phenomena of social evil merely the contingent results of that
   general plan of progress, by which the world is upon the whole
   advancing in wisdom and happiness, it is still further to be
   considered, that beneath the aggregate darkness of some of these
   phenomena there is often found much individual happiness. True also, we
   are apt, from familiarity with such phenomena, to underrate the fearful
   amount of actual suffering which they represent. Yet, upon the whole,
   the balance lies on the other side. There is such a powerfully elastic
   spring of happiness in the human heart, that its presence, even in
   intense forms, is not to be denied under the darkest oppression and the
   most utter poverty. Even among those who live under systems of the
   cruelest and most godless injustice, there may be found circulating the
   free flow of exalted and joyous sentiment. In the miserable cabin of
   many a poor African there may be heard the voice of melody; and pure
   affection and simple piety may gladden many an otherwise dark and
   comfortless home. The soul may be emancipated while the body is
   enslaved, and sunshine may cheer the heart while ungrateful toil
   wearies the bones. Happiness, the sweetest and least interrupted on
   earth, may certainly belong to the lot of righteous poverty; and even
   in circumstances the least favourable, it is consolatory to reflect
   that happiness is not bound by the impious devices of tyrannic
   power--that it can find a nest for itself even where industrial misrule
   or lawless despotism may have laboured most zealously to extinguish it.

   And, finally, the light of a higher explanation is beheld breaking upon
   us from the future, as, with the growth of human improvement, the
   "increasing purpose" of Beneficence becomes more manifestly stamped on
   all the civil relations of the world, and "a purer order and diviner
   laws" are even now beginning to bind into a nobler life its multiplied
   combinations. As the invasions of human selfishness are driven back
   before the progress of Christian enlightenment, the Divine plan of
   infinite wisdom and goodness will be seen more visibly revealed in
   history, and more obviously expressed in society.

   [162] All this bearing of our subject, upon which we touch very
   incidentally, is discussed with fulness, and at the same time admirable
   clearness and calmness, in Archbishop Sunnier's Treatise, which
   received one of the prizes when the subject was previously prescribed
   in 1814 (vol. ii. pp. 40, 118). Here, as throughout, objections which
   peculiarly deserved attention then, no longer need any special
   treatment.

   [163] It might no doubt be asked, Could we not have had the advantage
   of development without the disadvantage? To which we can only reply,
   that it was no doubt possible that human history might have been a
   development of good throughout; had man not sinned, we have reason to
   believe it would have been so; yet, in the mere fact of moral
   development, evil is contingent, and, consistently with the nature of
   that development, could not have been absolutely excluded. Here,
   equally as in the individual, the possibility of disorder lies in the
   very character of the life to be trained and developed. And here,
   therefore, again we see, as everywhere in this region, that the
   question is thrown back upon this ultimate mystery.
     __________________________________________________________________

§ IV.--CHAPTER VI.

  SPECIAL EXAMINATION CONTINUED--SIN.

   THE considerations presented in the foregoing chapters serve, we
   apprehend, somewhat to obviate special difficulties regarding the
   wisdom and goodness of God. The various forms of evil which meet us as
   apparently formidable obstacles in the way of the theistic inference,
   are found, on examination, to be at least by no means so formidable as
   at first they appear. At the very worst, they do not exhibit themselves
   as unmixed evils. They bear, every one of them, some compensatory
   significance of an important kind. On the general platform of animal
   life, and in reference to the most comprehensive phenomena of evil
   which there occur, this compensatory character is so prominent, and
   enters so directly into the intended constitution of things, that it
   seems greatly to remove the element of difficulty which superficially
   is felt to exist. Pain, while it shows itself to be contingently
   related to pleasure in the very nature of the sensitive organism--to be
   a liability springing out of the very fact of the good--appears reduced
   to its minimum throughout the lower brute creation; while organic
   extinction is seen to be a mere transition to higher and more abundant
   modes of life, in the wide and ever-expanding diversity of which the
   wisdom and goodness of the Deity are ever more truly and conspicuously
   displayed.

   The same compensatory character, whereby a higher good is still
   developed from the partial evil, is found to mark the difficulties
   which occur in the sphere of human life, although manifestly it is no
   longer, in this sphere, so adequate for explanation. Here, while
   suffering is no less clearly seen to serve purposes of good, there is
   yet very clearly left a residuum of difficulty unexplained. The
   beneficent use of sorrow is indeed apparent, and thoroughly
   satisfactory as to its existence, proceeding on the fact that
   discipline is needed to purify and exalt human life; but the question
   at once presses itself, Why this disciplinary necessity? what
   explanation does it admit of?

   We readily admit, therefore, that while, by the light of enlarged and
   impartial inquiry, we are enabled to see good everywhere in the evil,
   and so far to obviate the difficulties which arise from the latter
   regarding the Divine wisdom and goodness, we do not, by such
   considerations, remove the difficulties. The darkness clears away a
   little as we gaze steadily into it, and make ourselves familiar with
   it, but it is still there. The light has penetrated, but not dispersed
   it. It is somewhat broken up and driven back, but it only concentrates
   itself more deeply--in an aspect of more intense enigma--on the further
   point to which it has retreated.

   Following this plan, however, of carrying up the different forms of
   evil which meet us in human life to their true source, we are enabled
   to see clearly the final amount of difficulty with which the theistic
   argument has to deal. If we fail to give an adequate explanation of the
   lower evils, it is only because they imply a further element of moral
   evil which arrests us. Bringing fully into view this difficulty, and
   holding it in all its inexplicable magnitude before us, it serves, in
   its very intensity, to cast a full meaning on the dependent
   perplexities. In this comprehending evil of sin, all the lower
   phenomena of evil in human life find their satisfactory explanation.

   This higher view of the subject is one from which our older theistic
   literature has, for the most part, shrunk. It has aimed to bring out
   the compensatory significance of all suffering, and to show how largely
   good is everywhere subserved by evil; but the explanatory meaning which
   suffering everywhere assumes in the view of sin, has not been clearly
   apprehended by it. Sin has apparently been regarded as something beyond
   the sphere of its observation: and, holding this fact out of sight, it
   is not to be wondered at that an air of unsatisfactoriness should
   attach to its best endeavours [164] to resolve those phenomena of
   suffering of which we have been speaking.

   On the other hand, by bringing into view the fact of sin, if the
   problem in the end be only deepened, it is yet simplified. The mind is
   left to rest on a single point of darkness, whose apprehension leaves
   all the different phenomena of human suffering at least fully
   intelligible. For when we consider the fact of sin, it no longer
   remains wonderful that there should be suffering. The true marvel would
   have been, if, with the presence of sin, there had not been suffering.
   For a moral instinct of the most direct and irresistible character
   assures us that the latter is everywhere the inevitable consequence of
   the former--that the two are bound together, and essentially
   coexistent, in the nature of the case. Because man is a sinner, he is a
   sufferer. It is sin that smites him with pain, and wounds him with
   sorrow. It is sin which darkens life for him, and embitters death. When
   we seize, therefore, this fact of sin, the mystery of suffering
   disappears within it.

   Especially is this the case when we apprehend the fact of sin in clear
   connection with that complete doctrine of Theism as to the Divine
   goodness which formerly opened up to us in the course of our argument.
   In the law of conscience we found that the good interprets itself as
   the right. The moral good which commands us in conscience is
   righteousness. The one idea only sustains itself in the other, and
   finds its complement in it. The attribute of Divine goodness becomes,
   accordingly, in relation to moral life, also Divine righteousness. The
   two conceptions are essentially inseparable. If we regard sin, then, in
   this higher theistic light, we will at once see that suffering is its
   necessary mark of punishment. Asserting itself in opposition to the law
   of conscience, it thereby directly opposes itself to the righteous will
   of God, of which that law is the expression, and so provokes His
   punishment. Existing only as a rebellious infraction of Divine will, it
   necessarily calls forth the Divine wrath. In its very character,
   wherever it occurs in the universe of God, sin accordingly is, and must
   be, marked by His displeasure. It must bear the brand of suffering. It
   must have its doom written on it. And in this point of view, so far is
   suffering from constituting a valid objection to the Divine goodness,
   that it is truly a manifestation of that goodness. Rightly viewed, the
   Divine punishment of sin is merely another side of the Divine goodness.
   Tor inasmuch as goodness only completes itself in righteousness, were
   sin or unrighteousness not visited with punitive suffering, the Divine
   goodness could not be the reality which conscience demands. It might
   remain a vague and beautiful dream of the imagination; but a goodness
   which in any respect came short of righteousness would, in the very
   nature of the case, prove a vanishing shadow--a mere fiction, on which
   the heart could never rest. Let the one idea be lost sight of, and the
   other will altogether fail to legitimatise itself, or keep its ground.
   A goodness which does not rest on justice, and embrace it, would, in
   the highest meaning of the attribute, be no goodness--our own moral
   conscience being judge--and would leave, therefore, no real foundation
   for that happiness in whose behalf it is sometimes emptied of this
   essential element. In all this view, therefore, the Divine goodness is
   seen not only to be consistent with, but to be expressly called forth
   in human suffering as the punishment of sin.

   But when we contemplate sin, in its own essential character, as most
   truly misery, this becomes still further evident. Any other conception
   we can form of misery is poor and trifling in comparison with that
   which is summed up in the fact of sin itself. The temporary evil of
   suffering is, therefore, most truly good, when viewed as the chastening
   of sin, to deliver us from its power. Its bitterness is a direct agency
   of Divine beneficence, to save us from a darker and more hopeless
   bitterness. Had sin not thus borne the reprobation of suffering, and
   man's sinful progress experienced no check from it, the Divine goodness
   would undoubtedly have been left in far greater obscurity than it is.

   But what of sin itself? What theistic explanation does it admit of? Has
   not our whole previous train of reasoning been merely a fencing with
   the outer or accessory difficulties of the subject, while the great
   difficulty lies here? We are certainly far from concealing that in the
   comprehensive fact of sin is contained the chief mystery with which we
   have to deal. We have, on the contrary, all along implied this. It has
   been our aim simply to show, in reference to human life, how all the
   difficulties attending the theistic inference run up into this point,
   and here find their ultimate force. And if, at length, in approaching
   this point, we find that the light of explanation fails us, or, in
   other words, find that we cannot at all resolve sin in our process of
   theistic induction, it may at the same time appear that this arises
   from its very nature, which is such as compels us to cast it out of the
   theistic argument, and per se liberates that argument from its
   injurious burden, mysterious and irresolvable as it may for ever
   remain. It may be seen that, while this mystery defies all solution, it
   separates itself by its character from all direct relation to the
   Divine agency. Profound as is the difficulty it involves, it is a
   difficulty, when rightly understood, not immediately regarding the
   Divine character (about which its own testimony leaves no doubt), but
   regarding its human possibility.

   Sin, as we have already assumed, is in its essential conception the
   revolt of the human self against the Divine. Whereas the good consists
   for us in the harmony of the Divine and the human will, the evil
   consists essentially in the insurrection of the latter against the
   former. The soul passes out of the sphere of Divine conformity, and
   asserts itself in an attitude of opposition to God and to goodness.
   This is the most radical principle of moral evil. It is this element of
   rebellious self-will against the Divine law that we specially mean by
   sin. It expresses itself in many forms, and assumes many characters;
   but in this element of rebellious self-will they all take their rise.
   This is the perverted essence which pervades all.

   Such being the true character of sin, it must be obvious, in its very
   definition, that we cannot bring it into inductive relation with the
   course of our evidence; or, in other words, that we cannot find any
   argumentative solution of it. For how can we intelligibly relate that
   to God, whose very essence consists in opposition to Him? How can we
   explain that which in itself, in its very conception, presents the
   uttermost contradiction? In order that anything may be capable of
   explanation, it must exhibit some ground of reason; but here all is
   unreason. That any creature should revolt against its Creator can only
   present itself as the most awful and unfathomable folly. Sin,
   therefore, baffles all explanation. Every attempt that has been made to
   throw any light upon it, or to resolve it inductively, has ended, in
   the very nature of the case, in denying it. [165] All that we can say
   or know is, that the possibility of sin lies in the fact of human
   freedom. Man being made free to choose good or evil, the choice of the
   latter was possible--but further all is darkness; and if we insist for
   a moment in carrying our logical explanations up into this region, we
   only plunge into deeper and more hopeless darkness.

   But in this very confession of the utter unintelligibility of sin, is
   not our argument relieved from its difficulty? We cannot give any
   theistic explanation of it. But why? Because, in its very essence, it
   is anti-theistic. It is in God's creation, but it is there as a blot
   upon it--in direct violation of the Divine order which otherwise
   prevails. In its nature it wholly separates itself from God, and is,
   therefore, whatever we may make of it, not entitled to reflect
   injuriously on the Divine character. A true perception of sin leaves
   it, indeed, an insoluble difficulty, but is so far from allowing its
   darkness to rest on the Divine wisdom and goodness, that it is only
   against the truth of these attributes that its heinousness comes fully
   into view. It is only its opposition to Divine wisdom and love that
   makes sin what it is. And to this itself bears witness in its own
   innermost darkness. In the very act of stamping its atheistic impress
   upon the soul, it belies its own act; and in its deepest abandonment
   proclaims the reality of the Divine goodness with which it strives. The
   rebellious self-will which opposes itself to God, yet trembles before
   Him. It trembles because of its own unquenchable witness to the truth
   of those perfections which it practically denies. So long as conscience
   is not utterly extinguished, there arises from the very heart of
   depravity this irrepressible testimony. This it is, in fact,
   which--asserting itself against the most persistent godlessness--gives
   to that godlessness all its direst unrest and misery. The sense of
   guilt, in its worst agony, is nothing save the consciousness of
   hostility to Divine wisdom and goodness.

   NOTE.

   Various theories have professed to expound what is called the origin of
   evil. The most comprehensive and impartial account of these theories
   that we know of is to be found in the second book of Dr Julius Müller's
   treatise on the Christian doctrine of sin. On a careful examination,
   one and all of them will be found to explain sin by virtually denying
   it in its true character. Dr Müller has reckoned them as four, under
   the several names of the theories of Dualism, of Contrast, of Sense,
   and of Metaphysical Imperfection. The only two of them that can be said
   to possess any special interest, or to deserve any special notice, are
   those of Contrast and of Metaphysical Imperfection. The former derives
   certain pretensions from its analogy to that compensatory mode of
   argument which we have pursued in previous chapters. It is, in truth,
   nothing else than this argument reduced to the palpable
   contradictoriness that lies in it when pushed to extremity. The latter
   claims attention from the influential names that have promulgated it,
   and the manner in which it has been associated with Christian
   literature. Both, besides, have this special claim upon our notice,
   that while neither of them can be said any longer to possess vitality
   as speculative theories, they yet truly live and find utterance in many
   of our current modes of literary and theological culture.

   In this view we present here a summary of Dr Müller's exposition of
   them, which has in some part elsewhere appeared, but which, in relation
   to the subject of the foregoing chapter, may be interesting to a
   certain class of readers. It will certainly serve to set forth more
   clearly the conclusion of that chapter as to the absolute
   unintelligibility of the evil, and the consequent futility of all
   attempts to explain it.

   The theory of Contrast may be thus stated: Evil, like darkness or cold,
   is an indispensable element of alternation in human life. All
   individual reality is only the product of opposite forces working
   together. Pure light were in itself perfectly colourless--identical, in
   fact, with darkness: it is only the blending of the various shades of
   both which gives us actual light. The plant, were it a single power,
   would not grow: it is only the co-operation of opposite powers which
   promotes its development. So in man, individuality--character--is only
   the product of the opposing ethical moments of good and evil. Perfect
   purity, without flaw, without struggle, would be a mere empty and
   useless abstraction. All life and energy only arise from the mutual
   conflict of the positive and negative. In nature we have attraction and
   repulsion--positive and negative electricity; in ordinary life, pain
   and pleasure, rest and activity, health and sickness. Take away any of
   these relative moments, the other would disappear with it. Take away
   repulsion, there would be no more attraction. Let pain disappear, so
   would pleasure. Rest is no more rest if it does not spring from
   activity; and the joy of health is only known through sickness. Why
   should it be different in the sphere of morals? Here, too, there must
   be a polarity. Good can only be in contradistinction to the evil. It is
   only from their interaction that the moral life derives any character
   and energy. How utterly devoid of interest--how stale, flat, and
   unprofitable--were our life, were sin entirely to disappear! Where
   would be all that now in history or romance gives a charm to it? Where
   would be the passions that now lend to poetry all its power, and to the
   arts all their witchery?

   The relation of this to our previous compensatory mode of argument will
   be apparent. Whereas, however, that mode of argument is simply made use
   of by us to show the good which still attends the evil, and seems even
   to rise out of it--reduced, as it is here, to a logical explanation of
   moral evil, it secures its object only by destroying the fact to be
   explained. So far as we have urged the argument, it amounts to this,
   that the evil is everywhere contingently related to the good, and
   appears in its mere capacity to be so connected with it, that we do not
   know that we could have had the one, and the other been absolutely
   excluded. But the present theory not only finds good in the evil, but
   it makes moral evil an absolute condition of moral goodness. In this
   view it is not, and cannot be any longer evil. It enters no longer as a
   spring of disorder, but as a necessary integral into the development of
   human life. In fact, the good in contrast to the evil is no longer
   good, but rather evil, and the evil good; for it is only the quickening
   impulse of the former gives the latter vitality and strength. Without
   this the good were no reality, but a mere slumbering torpid
   potentiality. It lies in the last logical results of this theory,
   therefore, to enthrone the evil as the first principle. It does not
   depend upon the good, but the good, so far as it is possessed of any
   living power, depends upon it; or, at any rate, the concrete reality in
   which they unite is something in which the properly distinctive
   characters of the two conceptions disappear.

   But this theory moreover rests on a special misstatement of the fact in
   question. It is by no means true that the good, as such, needs the
   reaction of the evil to attain energy and consistency. No doubt there
   are, as we have seen, forms of good which we can only imagine in
   contrast to evil,--nay, there would seem to be, as we formerly
   expressed it, a richer power of good in the end from the very presence
   of the evil--but this is something wholly different from recognising,
   according to the present theory, the good to be absolutely dependent
   upon the evil, and only to be possessed of activity from co-operation
   with it. Life and activity are, on the contrary, essential elements of
   the good in itself. As a creaturely product, it is certainly dependent
   for its development on the coaction of relative forces, both bodily and
   mental; but its relation to the evil is still only, even when it
   derives strength from the relation, one of conflict. It is the very
   warfare with the evil, and repulsion of it, that imparts strength and
   higher glory to the good. Every corrupting association of the evil with
   the good is, therefore, still so far evil, and not good.

   The second theory to which we have referred is that which traces moral
   evil to the Metaphysical Imperfection of human nature. This is
   especially known as the theory of Leibnitz in his Theodicée, although
   it really dates from Augustine, and had even, in our own literature,
   received an elaborate exposition some years before the appearance of
   the Theodicée, in the well-known work of Bishop King. According to this
   theory, evil is considered to be a mere privation; to be in morals, in
   short, what cold and darkness are in physics--a pure negation. It is
   only the perfect or absolute that is positive: all imperfection
   proceeding from limitation is of a privative or negative character. But
   God alone is perfect. The creature in his very nature is limited. This
   limitation shows itself in man, in the presence of error beside truth
   in his understanding--of pain beside pleasure in his senses. Is it
   wonderful, then, that in his will this limitation should also manifest
   itself in the presence of evil beside the good? According to this view,
   evil takes its rise, not in an efficient cause (causa efficiens), but
   only in a causa deficiens. God gives the creature his qualities only in
   so far as they are real and positive; the deficiency does not spring
   from His will, but from the nature of the thing. God is willing to
   bestow every perfection in the fullest possible degree, but the
   receptivity of the creature in its very conception is limited. This
   limited receptivity has its ultimate ground in the Divine
   understanding, the region of eternal truth--the forms or ideas of the
   possible--the sole thing which God has not made, as He is not the
   author of His own understanding. In this way Leibnitz conceives that he
   obviates the reference of the evil to God. Every positive faculty of
   man is to be traced back to God; but the evil, as a mere privation,
   cannot be so traced. What is good cometh from the strength of God--what
   is evil, from the torpor of the creature. [166]

   It has been shown by Dr Müller that this theory admits in some degree
   of two interpretations. It may be understood as either deriving sin
   necessarily out of the original imperfection of the creature, or as
   only placing the possibility of sin in this imperfection. While some of
   Leibnitz's expressions would seem to favour the latter interpretation,
   there can yet be little doubt, we think, that it was in the former
   sense he himself meant it to be understood, as in this sense alone can
   it be said to have any title to be considered a theory of the origin of
   evil. It was his whole object "to justify the ways of God to man," and
   the secret of this justification he undoubtedly believed himself to
   have found in the conception of evil as necessarily inherent in the
   limitations of the creature. Evil is a direct and inevitable
   consequence of these limitations--une suite des limitations
   précédentes, qui sont originairement dans sa creature--so that in
   creating the world at all, God (so to speak) could not help the
   admixture of evil in it; inasmuch as it could not be absolutely
   perfect, it could not be free from evil. But the evil is the least that
   could have been. The world is the "best of all possible worlds!"

   This theory of metaphysical imperfection has been among theologians the
   most favourite mode of explaining the origin of evil. It took its rise
   in the case of Augustine, there can be no doubt, from the necessity
   felt by him of opposing to the Dualistic conception of the Manicheans
   some solution of the great problem in consistency with the Divine unity
   and perfections. And it has maintained its place in theology, as
   seeming to furnish, upon the whole, the solution of this problem most
   reconcilable with these perfections. Among our latest writers on
   Natural Theology, Dr Chalmers expounds it with zest, and puts it
   forward as hypothetically valuable in meeting the cavils of scepticism,
   although manifesting considerable reluctance to accept it as
   satisfactory. There are perhaps few more signal examples of the
   perverting influence of theoretic arbitrariness on theological
   literature than that which is presented by this theory.

   A little examination of it will serve to show this. And first of all,
   the conception which it presents of sin is in direct contradiction to
   the moral consciousness. Sin is not the ens privatum which this theory
   holds it to be; it is, on the contrary, of an essentially positive
   character. It bears no analogy to any of the other limitations or
   imperfections which attach to our nature; these are merely the
   appropriate accidents or conditions of our finite being. But it is, on
   the other hand, of the very essence of sin that it reveals itself from
   the first as an element of disorder and opposition within us. If
   regarded as inherent in the necessary imperfection of our being, we are
   then reduced to the strange conclusion, that out of the very
   limitations which go to constitute the conception of the creature there
   arises a limitation which contradicts this conception. But further, in
   making sin, as this theory does, the necessary result of the
   imperfections of our nature, it thereby, no less than all other
   theories, really destroys it. For sin being necessary, it is no longer
   morally blamable. If it spring out of the essential limitations of our
   being, it is no longer a fault, but only a misfortune. In this point of
   view, too, this theory wholly fails in its attempts to turn aside the
   reference of sin to God. Granting that this creaturely limitation is
   the proximate cause, yet this creaturely limitation is only such as the
   appointment of God. There is only a causa deficiens in so far as called
   into existence by the causa efficiens. Leibnitz's distinction of
   understanding and will in the Deity does not really avail to obviate
   this conclusion, unless the distinction is to be seized in an
   absolutely dualistic sense.

   And if necessary in its origin, sin, according to this theory, must be
   no less eternal in its duration; inasmuch as the creature can never be
   absolutely perfect, sin can never wholly disappear. It can still only
   be a vanishing minimum, as the creature approximates to the perfection
   of the Creator; and this is an idea which would seem even to have
   entered into the mind of Leibnitz, in his famous representation of the
   human spirit as an asymptote of the Divine. Could we conceive the still
   vanishing limit entirely away, man would be no longer man, but God. It
   is clear, then, that this theory, pushed to its fair logical results,
   only escapes Pantheism by making sin eternal. Man only ceases to be a
   sinner by becoming God. Most singular and instructive coincidence with
   the latest outrages of German speculation, and the favourite
   representations of the most seductive school of infidel literature,
   both in our own country and America! So striking is this coincidence,
   that in many of the expressions of Emerson, Leibnitz and even sometimes
   Augustine might be supposed to speak. From quite opposite impulses, but
   under the same rage for theorising, the modern transcendentalist has
   reproduced their idea of the evil being simply a deficiency of the
   good; only he has apprehended, which they did not, this idea in its
   strict logical consequence--as cutting up by the root the consciousness
   of guilt, and, in making sin a necessity, annihilating it as a moral
   fact.

   It is this strangely instructive result which enables us to see in the
   clearest light the fundamental vice of Leibnitz's theory, and, in fact,
   of all the theories on our subject. This vice consists in the
   application of purely logical or inductive conceptions to moral truth,
   while this truth in its very nature transcends the grasp of logic. It
   makes itself good in the inner spiritual consciousness, but it cannot
   be inductively seized and accounted for. The attempt so to seize it
   necessarily terminates in misapprehending it. It is obvious, for
   example, that it is such a perverting misapprehension which underlies
   the whole scope of the present theory. For if it does not confound
   metaphysical with moral defect, it yet makes the one an inevitable
   consequence of the other. A relation is thus implied which is wholly
   inapplicable, between mere perfection of being and perfection of moral
   life. In the former respect, God alone is or can be perfect; in the
   latter there may be, so far as we know, any variety of relative
   perfection. Sinlessness has no connection with mere mass of being, but
   exists entirely in the harmonious proportion between being and the
   moral laws under which it exists. And in like manner, sin has, and can
   have, no connection with mere metaphysical limitation or defect of
   being, but exists entirely in the discordance between it and its proper
   moral conditions. The two conceptions of good as mere being, and good
   as moral harmony, are totally and essentially distinct, and nothing but
   the most hopeless and irretrievable error can arise from their
   confusion. In the one case it is substance with which we deal,--more or
   less; in the other it is will,--right or wrong. No circle of thought
   can ever unite these conceptions, which are absolutely distinguished.
   We do not say, indeed, that the metaphysical definitions of being and
   non-being, affirmative and negative, possession and want, have no
   relation to the investigation of sin; but only that they are totally
   misapplied when made to express its real and essential principle. And
   so long as philosophy or theology remains fast bound in such logical
   abstractions, neither can have any true apprehension of its character,
   and in attempting to define it can only mistake it. We must rise into a
   quite different region, and bring into view that mysterious
   personality, which at once so directly relates man to the Fountain of
   all life, and yet contains within it the capacity of furthest
   alienation from Him, before we can reach any genuine perceptions of
   sin, and apprehend its essential contents. And when we have done this,
   we will not fail to apprehend, at the same time, how futile must be all
   attempts to explain the origin of sin, from the very character of the
   subject in which it takes its rise. All that we can know is, that the
   possibility of sin lies in the fact of personality; in other words, in
   the fact of human freedom. And as this fact is wholly inexplicable, so
   is equally the sin which has sprung from it. As Coleridge has said,
   with that profound moral insight which so often marks his scattered
   observations, and renders them so valuable to the Christian
   student,--"It is a mystery, that is a fact, which we see but cannot
   explain; and the doctrine (he means of original sin), a truth which we
   apprehend, but can neither comprehend nor communicate. And such, by the
   quality of the subject (namely, a responsible will), it must be, if it
   be a truth at all." [167]

§ IV.--CHAPTER VII.

  CONSIDERATIONS, ETC.--DERIVED FROM "WRITTEN REVELATION."

   IN the preceding chapters we have carried out our treatment of
   difficulties regarding the wisdom and goodness of God in so far as we
   are enabled to do by the light of nature. These difficulties, we have
   seen, in their most formidable aspect, concentrate in moral evil;
   which, on the other hand, refuses to be related inductively to the
   great Source of being, but asserts itself as the mysterious product of
   the human free-will. In its very nature, sin utterly separates itself
   from God, while yet bearing in its dark rebellion an unequivocal
   testimony to the Divine existence and character. Whatever may be its
   mystery and difficulty, therefore, it seems undoubted that the fact of
   moral evil is not entitled to affect injuriously the theistic
   inference.

   This conclusion appears to us so far satisfactory. As to the final
   difficulty of the origin of evil, it has been our express aim to show
   that it admits in its nature of no solution. It presents an
   impenetrable mystery; only the hopeless darkness which here at length
   meets us, cannot be allowed to rest legitimately on the Divine
   character. According even to the testimony of sin itself, that
   character stands out in clear brightness against it.

   In case, however, that any doubt should still surround this conclusion,
   we are finally led by the terms of our subject into the region of
   special Divine revelation. We do not suppose that it is meant that we
   should enter into any special proof of the Divine authority of this
   revelation. All that seems to us to be appropriately implied in the
   terms of the Essay is, that we should take a glance at this higher
   region of revelation before we close. Having sought in the lower region
   of natural inductive inquiry for all the light within our reach, we are
   invited finally to cast our gaze to that brighter light which professes
   to shine upon us directly from God Himself. The very strength and
   clearness of the lustre which the Christian revelation sheds around the
   Divine character, may at the same time go far, apart from any formal
   proof, to vindicate its Divine authority.

   Taking up, then, our argument at the point at which we left it, we had
   reached the conclusion that sin, from its very nature, could not only
   have no productive relation to God, but was directly opposed to Him. At
   this point, the gospel meets us in the most significant manner. It
   declares in its very conception God's hatred of sin, and opposition to
   it. It affirms that it was for the very purpose of destroying sin that
   He sent His Son Jesus Christ into the world. We are no longer left to
   infer from a process of reasoning regarding the Divine character, as
   revealed in the depths of our own conscience, that God is opposed to
   sin, but in the mission and death of the Lord Jesus He Himself makes
   this specially known to us with the most solemn effect. All our Lord
   did and suffered bore the same meaning of Divine hatred against sin.
   All expressed with an imperishable force that God is "of purer eyes
   than to behold evil," and cannot "look on iniquity."

   Thus carrying on our argument from the negative point at which we left
   it, we see with what decisive clearness the gospel interprets the
   indications of nature, and shows that the burden and injury of sin,
   however inscrutable, are directly rejected by God. Ascending slowly
   towards this conclusion from the attentive scrutiny of our moral
   consciousness, we are met by a direct utterance from God Himself, which
   places our conclusion beyond all hesitation, and enables us to rest in
   it with an impregnable security.

   But this negative testimony bears us but a little way into the full
   light which the Gospel sheds upon the Divine character. In this
   indirect manner it serves to vindicate that character from the
   application of the objection founded on the existence of moral evil;
   but in what a positive glory of wisdom and beneficence does it further
   place it! If its utterance, on the one hand, is that God is righteous,
   and hateth sin; its utterance, on the other, is that "God is light, and
   in Him is no darkness at all;" [168] and, moreover, and emphatically,
   that "God is love." [169] "In this was manifested the love of God
   towards us, because that God sent His only begotten Son into the world,
   that we might live through Him. Herein is love; not that we loved God,
   but that He loved us, and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our
   sins." [170] "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten
   Son, that whosoever believeth in Him might not perish, but have
   everlasting life." [171]

   Such is the full lustre of meaning which the revelation of the Lord
   Jesus sheds upon the dim hints of nature. If, after all their study of
   the latter, there be minds that return uncertain whether the Power that
   speaks to them in its varied changes, and is present in its varied
   aspects, be a beneficent Power, here, as it were, the heavens open, and
   a voice is heard whose utterance is a gospel of love. Whatever doubts
   may remain to the merely natural view,--whatever difficulties may
   impede the promptings of the heart,--are for ever dissipated by the
   clear and strong truth not only announced in words, but expressed in
   action,--not only declared by the mouth of an apostle, but exemplified
   by the mission and death of His own Son,--that God is love. "Scarcely
   for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some
   would even dare to die. But God commendeth His love toward us, in that,
   while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." [172]

   Sin, we see, so far from being entitled to darken to us in any degree
   the character of God, is the very fact which serves to bring out, in
   its greatest fulness and depth of brightness, the beneficence of that
   character. It is against this dark shadow that its lustre comes forth
   with the most glorious clearness. Had there been no sin, it is true
   that its difficulty would not have perplexed us. Yet it is to the very
   presence of sin we owe the surpassing manifestation of Divine goodness
   in the gospel. We see the Divine love here as we could not otherwise
   have seen it, stronger than sin or death, triumphing over the very
   enmity assailing it, and out of the very darkest difficulty in the
   moral universe bringing forth the most significant tribute to the
   wisdom and beneficence of the Divine government.

   It is especially in the perfect harmony of Divine righteousness and
   love, as displayed in the gospel,--in the spectacle which it exhibits
   of God hating sin, and yet loving the sinner,--that its testimony is so
   emphatic, and that we are enabled to dwell with such satisfaction on
   that testimony. We have already seen how inalienably intertwined are
   the attributes of goodness and righteousness--how the former only
   sustains itself in the latter, and, apart from it, would wholly fail to
   preserve its own peculiar life and virtue; but while our highest
   conception of those attributes shows them indeed to be one and
   indivisible, yet it must be admitted that they present themselves in
   the mirror of actual life frequently broken and dissevered. We see the
   traces of each, on the one hand, in happiness--on the other, in
   punishment; but we fail often to see their harmony; we are unable to
   join in a living synthesis the scattered intimations of nature; we
   cannot bring into consistency its disjointed speech. But in the
   revelation of the Lord Jesus, the fragmentary hints of nature receive a
   consistent and satisfactory interpretation. Goodness and righteousness
   are beheld in the sacrifice of the Cross as nowhere else. Here "mercy
   and truth have met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each
   other." [173] Here the strength of love and "the beauty of holiness"
   are mingled in a centre of Divine perfection, upon which the human
   heart can repose for ever with the firmest faith and liveliest hope.

§ IV.--CHAPTER VIII.

  THE DIVINE MAN INCARNATE WISDOM AND LOVE.

   WITH the last chapter the argument, as apprehended by us, might
   appropriately have closed; it seems so superfluous to argue on the
   foundation of the gospel revelation for the wisdom and goodness of
   God--that revelation being only conceivable as in the highest degree an
   expression of both. Yet it may be well simply to glance at some of the
   special features of Divine excellence thus declared to us. The teaching
   and character of the Lord Jesus, and the adaptation of the gospel to
   the spiritual elevation and consolation of the human race, seem to
   present, in this view, the most prominent points for notice.

   It is not now denied by any, even by those who repudiate the Divine
   authority of Christianity, that we have in the teaching and character
   of Christ a rare exhibition of wisdom and goodness. It is acknowledged
   that He who, eighteen hundred years ago, arose a Prophet among a feeble
   and distracted people, sunk in social and religious debasement, taught
   a purer and more exalted morality, and lived a life of more beautiful
   beneficence, than the history of the world elsewhere presents. While
   such a phenomenon, in all the circumstances, must appear somewhat
   inexplicable to those who do not recognise in it anything specially
   Divine, to the Christian it appears clearly intelligible and
   significant, He recognises in the man Christ Jesus the incarnation of
   Divine wisdom and love. He beholds in him the Word made flesh, who
   "dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only
   begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth."

   When we consider the special point in our argument at which we have
   arrived, we recognise the direct bearing upon it of this manifestation
   of Divine wisdom in Christ. With order everywhere pervading the
   physical world--with nature's harmonies all around--there reigned
   confusion alone in the life of man. There were in him the promptings of
   a noble life, which at the best remained unsatisfied, and which too
   frequently were soon utterly crushed under the dominion of his lower
   propensities and tendencies. There was government everywhere, but here
   misrule. Morality seemed rather a varying fiction than a sovereign
   reality. Giving all honour to the aspiring aims of heathen wisdom, it
   will not be maintained that any ancient moralist succeeded in
   discovering a perfect polity for this sphere of misrule. In the Porch
   and in the Academy there had, no doubt, been taught some pure and
   elevated lessons, and certain hints of a Divine morality had there been
   reached, which, as we read them now, seem anticipations of a loftier
   truth; but in none of the classic schools do we find a moral doctrine
   at once adequate and consistent.

   This is only to be found in the revelation of Jesus Christ. It is only
   in His character that we perceive a perfect example of moral order, and
   in His doctrine that we acknowledge a perfect rule of moral polity. He
   alone fully understood what was in man, and what he needed to raise him
   above the mere earthly life so natural to him, into the nobler
   spiritual life of truth and duty. Stoicism on the one hand, and
   Platonism on the other, and, later than either, Eclecticism, as
   represented by the devout and meditative Plutarch, had discerned, with
   sufficiently clear vision, certain aspects of man's spiritual being;
   but they altogether failed in that comprehensive conception of it which
   is expressed in the teaching of Christ. They failed to seize the
   twofold character of moral greatness and yet natural degradation which
   man everywhere presents, and which is at once so clearly mirrored and
   so comprehensively addressed in Christianity. This profound moral
   insight and completely adequate power of moral instruction are nowhere
   else exhibited. Seeing as man never saw into the secrets of the human
   heart, the Lord Jesus "spake as never man spake." His simple utterances
   breathed a wisdom of which the sagacity of Socrates and the genius of
   Plato had only caught far-off and imperfect glimpses. He taught man, as
   neither of them had done, to know himself; He touched with a master
   hand the secrets of his moral being, revealing their discord, and
   providing the key to their higher and purer harmony. He brought back,
   in short, into the sphere of moral misrule, moral order; so that the
   Theist beholds in Him a perfect expression of Divine wisdom. The
   difficulties which may result from the broken and defaced
   manifestations of this wisdom in the general picture of humanity have
   here no place; for here is the representation, at once in life and in
   doctrine, of moral perfection. In the man Jesus Christ all the
   disorders of humanity disappear, and the Divine and human are seen in
   complete and most beautiful union. Here we have the "possibility of the
   human race made real;" and in the lustre of this perfect revelation of
   moral excellence the Divine wisdom shines forth with conspicuous
   fulness. Nay, here to the Christian Theist is the Divine wisdom, "its
   express image and the brightness of its glory."

   And here is certainly not less conspicuous the revelation of the Divine
   goodness. The life and the death of Christ presents, in truth, the most
   exalted picture of love that we can conceive. The more we contemplate
   them, the more does the impression of Divine beneficence rise upon us.
   He went about continually doing good. He dwelt among men as a brother,
   sharing their joys, and alleviating with an inexhaustible fulness of
   compassion their sorrows. He lived only to communicate happiness, and
   to shed around Him blessing. His ear was ever open to the cry of the
   wretched, and His hand ever ready to help the helpless. No aspect of
   human suffering repelled His sympathy--no magnitude of moral baseness
   checked the flow of His pity. He healed the broken-hearted, and set at
   liberty the bruised spirit. He made the blind to see, the lame to walk,
   the deaf to hear: the sick man heard His voice, and his sickness was
   cured; the dead heard it, and rose to life again. The spirit of
   beneficence animated Him with so Divine a strength that it triumphed
   over every obstacle of hatred and persecution which surrounded Him, and
   flowed forth in currents of kindness towards His most obstinate and
   bitter enemies. His love sought and accepted no reward save its own
   exalted exercise. Persecution could not prevent it--indignity could not
   repel it--contumely could not ruffle it--death could not quench it.
   What a depth of Divine compassion breathes in His lament, "O Jerusalem,
   Jerusalem, how often would I have gathered thy children together as a
   hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, but ye would not!" What a
   fervour of infinite mercy is expressed in His prayer, "Father, forgive
   them--they know not what they do."

   The whole life of the Saviour is truly a life of love. We cannot regard
   any feature of it that does not bear the impress of beneficent
   devotion; and as we evermore meditate on its Divine beauty, we still
   see some finer traits of tenderness in it, and a more ennobling stamp
   of grace.

   But it is in the sufferings and death of Christ that the picture of
   Divine love appears most marvellous and transcendent. Here we behold
   Him wrestling not only with others' misery and overcoming it, but
   moreover with the dark burden of His own inexplicable agony, and
   triumphing under all. As we contemplate the lonely and shadowed figure
   of Gethsemane's garden, bowed beneath a load of suffering which tongue
   shall never tell, and as we raise our eyes to the bleeding victim on
   the cross, we feel that there is a light of inexpressible love shining
   on us from amid all that darkness, as it burns with a radiant glow in
   the bosom of the sufferer. The presence of a love stronger than death
   alone sustains under all that mysterious passion. There is here, our
   hearts tell us, a love which "passeth knowledge." There have, indeed,
   been others who have loved unto death--who have counted not their own
   lives dear, for some noble principle or glorious cause--yet there is
   something in the love of Christ which at once sets it above the
   loftiest example, or even the loftiest ideal of merely human affection.
   It is a love solitary in its depth and grandeur, reaching far beyond
   our conception in the height to which it rises above moral sympathy,
   and triumphs over moral enmity. Our minds cannot understand, but our
   hearts acknowledge a love which fed upon the very neglect, and took
   strength from the very contempt, which it encountered; a love which
   unworthiness only quickened, and hostility only fanned--which only
   glowed with the brighter and more ardent lustre the more it was crushed
   and bruised--which, from the bloody sweat of Gethsemane's garden, and
   the darker agonies of Calvary's cross, only gathered fresh vigour and
   mastery, till it brought forth battle unto victory, and, ascending to
   that eternal Bosom whence it emanated, "led captivity captive," and
   "gave gifts to men."

   It is surely impossible to contemplate such a love without feeling that
   the great heart of God whence it came is love; and whatever
   difficulties may beset the burdened human heart, there is here a
   presence of love unstained, to which it can ever joyfully turn. There
   is here a radiance of beneficence which shines only the more intense
   from the dark background of sin and sorrow which reflects it. There
   issues here, from the very shadowing of the Divine character, a richer
   brightness, and from the hiding of its strength only a more glorious
   fulness.

§ IV.--CHAPTER IX.

  THE GOSPEL A DIVINE POWER OF MORAL ELEVATION AND CONSOLATION.

   How directly the Gospel manifests the wisdom and goodness of God has
   been already apparent. It is throughout expressly and most impressively
   a revelation of both. It is not merely, however, on its own profession,
   as it were, but moreover in its practical effects, that we are enabled
   to appeal to it so confidently in this respect. It not merely tells us
   that God is love, but it exhibits the fact in its widely beneficent
   influence.

   It is, indeed, impossible to conceive how the Divine wisdom and
   goodness could have been demonstrated, in the special circumstances
   which tend to obscure them, more effectually than by such a discovery
   as the gospel. The great difficulty, we have seen, upon which inquiry
   can throw no light--before which the highest efforts of human wisdom
   are powerless--is the existence of moral evil. In such a conjuncture
   the gospel meets us, not only telling us of Divine wisdom and goodness,
   but proving itself to be the revelation of both in its effectual
   dealing with sin. It lays hold of this fact as no philosophy has ever
   done, revealing at once its true character and the means of deliverance
   from it. It presents, for the first time, the full reality of the evil,
   and the full power of redemption from it.

   This redemptive power of the gospel presents a twofold aspect of pardon
   and of sanctification. Human life, in its deep disorder, needed not
   only a new power of virtue, but a free gift of reconciliation. Before
   the soul can rise in holy love to God, the curse of estrangement from
   Him must be removed, and this is only accomplished by the sacrifice of
   the Cross. The living and thankful surrender of the human to the Divine
   will (whereby sin is evermore subdued, and virtue evermore advanced),
   only rests on the great fact of Christ's propitiatory sacrifice. It is
   this which alone renders Christian virtue possible, and gives it all
   its meaning. It was such a sacrifice as this for which all heathenism
   cried out, but which all human effort could not make. It was the want
   of such a sacrifice that left heathenism so powerless. The human heart
   can only rest on the eternal foundation of an accomplished atonement,
   whereby God is beheld "reconciling the world unto Himself," and "not
   imputing unto man his trespasses." Here alone it finds a power of
   Divine peace and restoration. The blessing of pardon comes to it in
   Jesus Christ with an unspeakable force of healing. Its wounds are
   medicated, its terrors allayed, its burden of transgression removed;
   and, rejoicing in the grace of the Divine presence, it catches the
   sunlight of Divine purity as it falls on it in clear effulgence.

   The gift of reconciliation and the power of moral renovation are
   inseparably conjoined in the gospel. It meets man's necessity of
   mediation with an offended God in order that it may destroy within him
   the dominion of sin, and reconstitute and advance the kingdom of moral
   order. Heathenism could do neither. It could neither abate the terrors
   of guilt, nor give strength in the struggle with evil. But the gospel,
   by one and the same power, accomplishes both. The act of grace only
   completes itself in the work of holiness, which inseparably takes its
   rise in the former, and grows therefrom, as the fair tree from its
   happy springing in the prepared soil. The seeds of a new moral
   wellbeing are already quickened in the first contact of the soul with
   the Divine favour, and ready to develop into all forms of moral
   loveliness. All springs from, and all depends upon, the Divine power
   revealed by the gospel. Such a power alone enables man successfully to
   resist temptation and overcome evil. It alone secures him the mastery
   over all that is base and disorderly within him. It alone strengthens
   him for daily duty, and when the enticements of sin prove strongest,
   and the sense of responsibility sleeps, guards him from the snare of
   earthly passion, and guides him in the way of heavenly aspiration.
   Other agencies may so far help to improve his social condition, and
   even to refine and elevate his moral affections; but they cannot any of
   them, as this does, touch with renewing power the secret springs of his
   being, and advance him into a higher sphere of spiritual purity. They
   cannot any of them, as this does, raise him above the world of sense,
   and bring him near to the God of holiness. "For whatsoever is born of
   God overcometh the world; and this is the victory that overcometh the
   world, even our faith."

   Further, the gospel is an effectual source of consolation to man. In a
   previous chapter we have spoken of the beneficent use of sorrow, and of
   the virtuous strength and beauty which its presence often achieves in
   human life. It now becomes us to observe that the Divine element which
   is thus in sorrow, only rises to its genuine measure and reality in the
   gospel. Here alone does it become truly tempered into patience, and
   deepened into experience, and exalted into hope. Here alone does
   earthly grief become transmuted into heavenly fervour, and tears change
   into rapture. Here only does the sorrowing soul rise into spiritual
   strength, and a rare and self-denying devotion, where the light of
   Heaven illuminates its darkness; and in the brightness thus reflected
   from a higher sphere, "the sufferings of this present time are felt not
   worthy to be compared with the glory to be revealed."

   This consoling revelation of futurity is among the most divinely
   beneficent features of the gospel. Previously, there may have been a
   dim sense of man's immortality, and of the preparatory character of
   this life in relation to a higher. There were some, we know, who could
   write with pathetic beauty of the nobler life upon which the soul would
   enter beyond the grave; but the clear reality of a future life was
   alone disclosed in the revelation of the Lord Jesus. He alone
   "abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the
   gospel." It is only through His blessed teaching that the faith of
   immortality has become the living possession of the human mind and
   heart. He alone has shed an eternal brightness around the darkness of
   the present, and made all who believe in Him to feel with an
   unquenchable conviction that they shall never die. "I am the
   Resurrection and the Life: he that believeth in me, though he were
   dead, yet shall he live; and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall
   never die."

   In what a light of Divine meaning does this revelation of immortality
   set the brief period of earthly life! What a source of consoling
   strength is it to the weary human heart in its struggles with sin and
   sorrow! It comes as a beam piercing the darkness from a higher region
   of wisdom and love, of truth and justice, touching what were otherwise
   dim and strange with a radiance of heavenly significance, and the
   "otherwise unmeaning ciphers of time changing to orders of untold
   value." It is this faith of eternal life which now in so many homes
   lightens privation, and in so many hearts keeps off despair; which
   brings peace to the troubled, and resignation to the mourner, and takes
   even the gloom of fear from the night of death, as it opens up the
   heaven beyond.

   The meaning which the gospel has thus shed on life and death and
   futurity, giving man to see their true relation, serves, perhaps more
   than anything else, to reconcile the difficulties of time, and "to
   justify the ways of God to man." For it opens up a boundless prospect
   of being, in the light of which the perplexities of this earthly scene,
   if they do not disappear, yet become significant of divine results of
   the most exalted and beneficent character. Whatever there may be here
   that passes his comprehension, or even sometimes wearies his heart, the
   Christian, carrying as he does the peace of God within him, while the
   glory of immortality shines before him, is enabled to thank God and
   take courage.

IV. CHAPTER X.

  LIMITED RECEPTION OF THE GOSPEL--MILLENNIAL PROSPECT.

   THERE is an obvious objection, we are well aware, that may be taken to
   the foregoing representation. If the gospel be such a power of moral
   elevation and consolation to man--if it can so effectually restore the
   ruin wrought within him by sin, and thus manifests practically that
   perfect wisdom and goodness of which it speaks--why, it may be asked,
   has its influence hitherto been so limited? Why does it prevail within
   so narrow a compass, and, even where it does prevail, why is its
   beneficent power so obstructed and inadequate? A further difficulty
   would seem to emerge upon us from the very heart of the evangelical
   revelation of Divine wisdom and mercy.

   That this, however, is only a new form of the old difficulty of sin--of
   the fact of moral evil at all--is evident on a little reflection. For
   the undoubted reason why the gospel is, at this day, so slightly
   influential, is, that it is opposed by man's unbelief and selfishness.
   Men will not come unto Christ that they may have life. That sin which
   Christ lived and died to destroy, which His Spirit in the church
   everywhere is now working to destroy, opposes itself with hardened
   hostility to the truth, and where it cannot altogether oppose, degrades
   and corrupts it.

   But could not God overcome this hostility? Is it not the special
   representation of the gospel that it is only everywhere overcome by His
   direct agency? And why is not that agency so powerfully and universally
   exerted, as to bring all under its benign and happy sway? In such
   depths of dark and almost irreverent questioning we lose our footing,
   and are perhaps better silent in hopeful trust than loud in curious
   reply. Having acknowledged to the full extent the awful mystery of sin,
   we might rest our answer on this mystery. Wholly inscrutable, there is
   nothing about it more inscrutable than its continued power of
   resistance to the gospel--than its opposition to the truth bearing upon
   it at every point, and summoning it to surrender. A few words of
   explanation, however, suggest themselves.

   It is no doubt true that it is only through special Divine agency that
   the gospel everywhere makes progress, and that it is possible for us to
   conceive such a forth-putting of this agency as might speedily bring
   the whole world under its sway; yet it is no less, and in the very
   nature of the case, true, that this agency everywhere only works in
   co-operation with the free agency of man. It is a persuasive power,
   eliciting and strengthening man's spirit, but in no case forcibly
   overbearing it even for its most holy purposes. "The whole course of
   history, as well as the express teaching of revelation, prove that God
   has ever dealt with man, not by the strength of an irresistible power
   crushing all that is contrary to it, but by the moral strength of those
   Divine influences by which He seeks to draw every inferior will into
   true harmony with His own perfect will. And no doubt this is so,
   because, consistently with the blessed perfection of God, it could not
   be otherwise; because He is most glorified in being served by a world
   of created beings, who are endued with the mysterious power of willing
   good or evil, and who, through His grace and goodness, have been each
   one brought into true harmony with Him." [174] It is not difficult to
   see, indeed, that the idea of a forcible and compulsory advance of the
   gospel is not for a moment tenable even as a supposition. For in the
   very statement of this idea there is already implied the annihilation
   of the moral quality in man, which alone constitutes the gospel so
   great a blessing to him, or even makes him possibly a subject of it.
   Unless man were truly possessed of a will, the gospel would lose all
   meaning, as man would lose all distinction from the objects of nature
   around him. In such a case, it has been well said, "There could be
   really no true living being in the world except God. For to have a will
   is in truth to live. What are all things without this but mere
   machines, which must do the order of the one Will which acts through
   them? What are they but mere shadowy figures of being cast forth from
   the one Being? If we do not believe that there are separate wills, with
   this awful power of resisting the one Will, we must either make the
   perfectly good God the direct cause of evil, or we must admit a second
   first cause from whom that evil springs." [175]

   Here, therefore, we come back to the final mystery of creation, the
   fact of human freedom. In this fact is contained at once man's glory
   and the possibility of his fearful revolt and shame. It is this alone
   which at once makes him a subject of Divine grace, and enables him to
   oppose that grace. Forcibly to destroy the capability of opposition,
   would be to destroy the very character of his being, and to leave him
   incapable of good any more than of evil. It is the awful peril of
   freedom, that while man may rise into union with God, and become a
   partaker of the Divine nature, he may no less harden himself against
   God, and fall away from Him into an ever deeper revolt and abandonment
   of selfishness.

   While, therefore, it is truly saddening and perplexing that the benign
   influence of the gospel has hitherto been confined within such narrow
   limits, it must be kept in view that this restraint of the gospel
   springs from man's sinful opposition, and not from any deficiency of
   wisdom or love in the Divine will. This, we apprehend, will not be
   denied by any Theist. Whatever be the more special views entertained in
   connection with this point, every Christian Theologian must admit that
   the perfection of the Divine character is not implicated in the
   restrained influence of the gospel. And this is all that is sufficient
   for our purpose to hold. Here, as hitherto, the mystery lies before us,
   impenetrably shrouded in its very nature, but reflecting its darkness
   directly, not on the Divine character, but on the mysterious fact of
   human freedom.

   Let us observe, at the same time, before passing finally from the
   subject, that there is disclosed to us in the future the prospect of a
   universal reign of holiness. The kingdom of Divine order, we are
   assured, shall yet prevail throughout the whole moral, as now
   throughout the whole physical world. To this gloriously beneficent end,
   human progress is now, amid whatever perplexities, everywhere tending.
   There may be much to cloud this prospect; there may even seem, in
   certain aspects of social life, and of literary and speculative culture
   in our day, to be rather a recession than an advance of the "gospel of
   the kingdom." Yet it is amid such very crises that Christianity is
   found pre-eminently to approve itself the power of God and the wisdom
   of God for the world's salvation. It puts forth its greatest strength
   in seasons of the utmost spiritual darkness. When there seems to be
   only the disturbance of conflicting opinions, there is silently
   preparing beneath the embryotic confusion a fresh life, destined to
   rise into nobler and fairer forms of wisdom and beneficence than any
   that have gone before. And this will certainly be the issue of present
   as of former conflicts. The Truth of God, purified by the very assaults
   which seem to threaten it, will go forth with a new strength,
   "conquering and to conquer."

   And this it will continue to do, till its purifying spirit penetrate
   every relation, and beautify every aspect of human life, till it stamp
   its bright and gladdening impress on every feature alike of individual
   and social culture, and throughout the moral universe there reign at
   once the most perfect order and the purest love. As we believe in God,
   we believe in the advent of this better time, "when all the kingdoms of
   the earth shall become the kingdom of our Lord and His Christ;" when
   unhappiness shall be no more, because sin shall be no more, and, amid
   the activities of unmingled beneficence, the world shall forget its
   past conflicts, and rejoice in an everlasting peace.

CONCLUSION.

CONCLUSION.

   IT now only remains to conclude our subject, by deducing "from the
   whole the inferences most necessary for, and useful to, mankind." It
   appears to us that we will best do this by briefly pointing out the
   essential connection of Theism both with a true worship and a true
   morality. There are no inferences which can possibly be more necessary
   and useful than these, and both seem to spring directly out of the
   whole course of our thought and reasoning in the present Essay.

   Theism, in its full and consistent interpretation, as set forth in
   these pages, is the doctrine of one almighty, wise, and loving Will.
   Personality is the central and most essential element of the doctrine.
   It is only this fact, expressed in our deepest consciousness, that
   contains for us at once the beginning and the completion of the
   theistic argument. Around this the whole doctrine gathers in its
   manifold significance and interest. From the same fact springs all its
   distinctive character of difficulty. For the final view unfolded by it
   is that of one creative Will in relation to created wills, which, while
   proclaiming their immediate dependence upon the former--"from whom, and
   by whom, and through whom, are all things"--yet really possess a life
   of their own, which may oppose itself to the supreme Source of life. In
   this antinomy Theism finds at once all its meaning and all its mystery.
   Herein is the one comprehending problem of creation; and yet herein, as
   it has been the whole aim of our argument to show, is the only key to
   an explanation of creation, which does not contradict equally the
   demands of reason and the promptings of conscience.

   In this doctrine of a personal God, to whom man holds a free personal
   relation, there is, we now assert, the only basis for a real and
   intelligent worship. A divine Being, in whom man lives, and yet from
   whose life he is, in a true sense, separate, is, and can be, alone an
   object of pious interest and devotion. Only towards such a Being can
   there be any impulse of solemn conviction--of reverent feeling. Let the
   fundamental theistic conception of will disappear, and there is no more
   any living Spirit to receive, or any living spirits to render worship.
   Substitute for this conception either the materialistic notion of law,
   or the pantheistic dream of a vast nature-life, and piety becomes a
   nonentity. For where there is no self-sacrifice, there can be no
   spiritual offering. There may be organic unity, but there cannot be
   moral harmony. In seeking to preserve the idea of life in contrast to
   what it calls "mechanical conceptions" of the Deity, our modern
   unbelief really empties life of all its noblest essence. It finds its
   highest expression in mere nature-growth, whereas this growth is only
   the dim shadow and type of the true life of the soul. It is only, as it
   were, the rippling play mirroring afar off the true depths of life,
   self-centred in God and in man, made in God's image. This element of
   self, as something wholly distinct and peculiar in creation, alone
   enables us to reach the genuine meaning of life; and in the interchange
   between the finite and the Infinite self, the free happy offering up of
   the one into the all-embracing bosom of the other, we have alone the
   realisation of worship.

   There may, indeed, be much beautiful talk of the worship of Nature, of
   the homage rendered by the whole round of impersonal existence as it
   fulfils with a grand uniformity the behests of its divine Author; but
   the face of nature, we know, as it thus fulfils its course, is turned
   to God with no smile of intelligent recognition, or of holy meaning.
   There is no free conscious response in its ever-circulating movements
   to the great Being from whom cometh all its change and beauty. It is
   the very glory of man, on the other hand, that in all he does he knows
   and wills what he is doing. And it is only in this element of
   intelligent and spontaneous action, of living and hearty surrender,
   that worship becomes a reality. It is only in the conception of a
   finite will yielding itself in free and loving obedience to the
   infinite Will, that piety finds its essential meaning. A theistic
   faith, therefore, alone recognises the condition of true worship.
   Pantheism in its very conception destroys it, and leaves man, whatever
   may be its pretensions, with no higher life than that of nature.
   Whether materialistic or ideal, it equally takes away from man any
   reality of existence distinct from the general existence of the
   universe. He is merely, in his whole being, a phase of the
   world-life--its highest point of development in the one case, its
   self-creating centre in the other. In either case there is and can be
   nothing higher than himself. The worship of humanity is, therefore, not
   only logically but avowedly the only possible worship to the
   Pantheist,--positive or speculative.

   M. Comte expressly propounds such a worship as the appropriate terminus
   of Positivism. Humanity, as the collective life of human beings, is in
   his system the être suprême the only one we can know, therefore the
   only one we can worship. [176] Hegelianism, in the later
   representations to which it has been consistently reduced by the "Young
   Germany" school, bears the same import, and utters the same language.
   We have, therefore, in these systems, something avowed as the only
   possible worship, which in its very conception contradicts the
   essential meaning of worship. Instead of self-prostration, we have
   self-exaltation--instead of self-sacrifice, self-idolatry. Worship
   becomes a phantasy, or, still worse, a profanity.

   In the more vulgar forms of materialistic unbelief all reality of
   worship is still more expressly destroyed. Secularism is the most
   recent form in which such unbelief has put itself forward in this
   country; and its most positive and distinguishing feature, it is
   instructive to notice, is the abnegation of all worship. Man, it is
   declared, has nothing to do with any life beyond the present visible
   one which is before him daily. Any hopes or fears for the future do not
   concern him. Every possible basis of religion is thus uprooted.
   Impiety, in such a system, becomes a creed, and animalism its constant
   and infallible tendency.

   It will be found, indeed, no less clear that morality only finds a
   valid basis in a theistic doctrine. It is only in such a personal
   relation between man and God as Theism implies that responsibility
   emerges, and the very conception of duty arises. Supposing man to have
   not merely the ground of his being in Deity, but to be actually, as
   Pantheism teaches, a part of Deity, so that the natural flow of his
   life is merely a phase or transitional expression of the All-life, it
   is plain that, in such a view, the very possibility of right and wrong
   vanishes. If man, in all the modes of his being, be nothing else than
   an expression of the divine Life which lives through all, there cannot
   be for him any morality. One species of action must be as good to him,
   because as divine to him, as another. And this is a conclusion from
   which modern Pantheism has not shrunk. In the figured speech of one,
   all whose writings are more or less pantheistic sermons, we are told
   "that the Divine effort is never relaxed; the carrion in the sun will
   convert itself into grass and flowers; and man, though in brothels or
   jails, or on gibbets, is on his way to all that is true and good."
   [177] We have here a genuine expression of Pantheism, which,
   notwithstanding its lofty prate of spiritualism, is still always, in
   the necessity of the case, falling back into the slough of sensualism,
   to which there is nothing higher than mere nature-life. Man is to it
   necessarily nothing else than "nature's noblest production." He is a
   more complex and beautiful outgrowth than the grass and the flowers,
   but this is all. There is no further spring of being in him than in
   them, and morality is therefore in its idea a mere figment. He is
   subject to no higher law than that by which nature works. And there is
   nothing, therefore, that can be false or wrong in his life, nor any
   more, indeed anything, that can be right. Such terms can have no
   meaning in such a system. Truth can only be a dream to it, and love an
   accident, finely as it may discourse of the imperishableness of both.
   [178]

   It is not to be denied, indeed, that Pantheism is often pure and lofty
   in its moral language. In minds of exalted bias and refined culture the
   mere life of nature is conceived of as something noble and elevating;
   and the writer from whom we have already quoted, betrays sufficiently
   in all his works his sense of such a life, in which the higher
   tendencies of humanity are supposed to receive exercise and
   satisfaction. But, lofty as may be the moral tone in which Pantheism
   sometimes speaks, it bears in its bosom no moral strength or vitality,
   and cannot do so. It may tell man to be a hero, but it has no voice of
   encouragement, of warning, or of help to him. It may bid him live
   purely as reason dictates; but man, in his common life, is not governed
   by the clearness of his intellect, but by the rectitude of his
   affections and will. Pantheistic intellectualism has accordingly shown
   itself to be the coldest and least potent creed that has ever sought to
   sway man. Some minds there may always be, as in the old Roman world,
   that can find in it a degree of moral nurture, but to the common mind
   and heart it is destitute of all moral meaning and power; nay, to them
   its sternest stoicism interprets itself by clear logical consequence as
   moral indifferentism, which readily passes over into any species of
   immorality, and theoretically legitimatises it. The only genuine moral
   elements of personality and conscience find no place in it, and in the
   denial of these we have in the end the sure destruction of all moral
   life and happiness.

   It is only a doctrine which preserves these elements in their full
   integrity that furnishes a consistent basis for man's religious and
   moral culture. As spiritual life only takes its rise in them, so it can
   only flourish where they are clearly acknowledged. The more deeply our
   whole being is studied, the more, we feel assured, will freedom and
   conscience, and, in a word, reason, as forming the comprehensive
   spiritual element in man, be acknowledged as realities,--and Theism
   hence be found the ennobling complement of all human study, no less
   than the direct expression of Divine Revelation.

  THE END.
