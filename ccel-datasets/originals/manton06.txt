TO THE READER.

   IT is the honour of the evangelical ministry, that it was principally
   instituted for the service of God, not as he is the governor of the
   earth, but the Lord of heaven, and to prepare men by holiness for his
   eternal kingdom. And it is an excellent favour of God to his ministers
   when their labours are eminently useful for this blessed end. This
   singular grace and privilege God was pleased to confer upon his
   faithful servant Dr Manton, whose life was spent in the most precious
   work of converting souls to Christ, and preparing them for the
   celestial paradise; and since his retiring from the world by death, his
   soul now enjoying the blessed rest above, yet he remains with us in
   what was most valuable of him, his excellent sermons, the productions
   of his holy mind and heart; and the pen having a larger extent than the
   tongue in communicating them, may be more beneficial to the church than
   before.

   The following sermons were preached by him in his usual course of three
   times a week, which I do not mention to lessen their worth, but to show
   how diligent and exact he was in the performance of his duty. Indeed,
   his ordinary sermons, considering the substantial matter, clear order,
   and vigorous full expressions, may well pass for extraordinary. I
   cannot but admire the fecundity and variety of his thoughts, that the
   same things so often occurring in the verses of this psalm, yet by a
   judicious observing the different arguments and motives whereby the
   Psalmist enforces the same requests, or some other circumstances, every
   sermon contains new conceptions, and proper to the text. Some few
   verses were not handled by him. I earnestly pray that those who shall
   read these sermons may taste the sweetness of the divine truths opened
   in them, and may be transformed into the spirit of David, by an inward
   feeling of the affections, and verifying in their own breasts the words
   of the holy prophet.

   W. Bates.

TO THE READER.

   CHRISTIAN READER,--It is somewhat difficult not to applaud that
   excellency which has first approved itself to our judgment. Hence is it
   that, though this work needs it not, I will so far gratify my own
   affections, and comply with obtaining custom, as to acquaint thee that,
   if thou hadst my eyes and taste, thou must admire its beauty, and
   confess its sweetness; much more when thou shalt use thy own more
   discerning eye and judicious palate.

   The matter of these sermons is spiritual, and speaks the author one
   intimately acquainted with the secrets of wisdom. He writes like one
   that knew the Psalmist's heart, and felt in his own the sanctifying
   power of what he wrote. Their design is practice; beginning with the
   understanding, dealing with the affections, but still driving on the
   advancement of practical holiness. They come home and close to the
   conscience; first presenting us a glass, wherein we may view the spots
   of our souls, and then directing us to that fountain wherein we may
   wash them away. They are of an evangelical complexion, abasing proud
   corrupt nature, and advancing free and efficacious grace in the
   conversion of sinners. The exhortations are powerful, admirably suited
   to treat with reasonable creatures, yet still supposing them to be the
   vehicle of the Holy Spirit, through which he communicates life and
   power to obey them.

   The manner of handling is not inferior to the dignity of the matter; so
   plain as to accommodate the most sublime truths to the meanest
   spiritual capacity, and yet so elevated as to approve itself to the
   most refined understanding. He knew how to be succinct without
   obscurity, and where the weight of the argument required it, to enlarge
   without nauseous prolixity. He studied more to profit than please, and
   yet an honest heart will then be best pleased when most profited. He
   chose rather to speak appositely than elegantly; and yet the judicious
   do account propriety the choicest elegancy. He laboured more
   industriously to conceal his learning than some others to ostentate
   theirs: and yet, when he would most veil it, the discerning reader
   cannot but discover it, and rejoice to find such a mass, such a
   treasure of useful learning, couched under a well-studied and
   artificial plainness. But let the reader take a taste of, let him
   concoct and digest, these spiritual discourses, and he shall say with
   the Sabean queen, It was a true report I heard in my own land; but
   behold the one-half was not told me!' Or with the men of Sychar, Now we
   believe, not because of thy saying, but because we ourselves have
   proved and experienced' their delicacies; as one taste of honey will
   more effectually commend its sweetness than the most elaborate oratory.

   Those ancients that had seen the first temple wept bitterly when they
   saw the foundation of the second laid. And perhaps some pious souls who
   have sat with great delight' under the author s ministerial shadow, and
   have found his fruit sweet to their taste,' may secretly shed a tear,
   that though they here meet also the same divine truths, the same
   spiritual matter, yet they want the living voice, the grateful
   elocution, the natural eloquence, in which that heavenly matter
   dropped, or rather flowed, from his gracious lips. But let the same
   consideration which quieted the spirits of those Jews of old satisfy
   theirs: God can fill this house also with his glory; and though the
   second edition of the temple fall short of the former in the beauty and
   symmetry of the structure, yet can the Spirit flow from the press as
   well as the pulpit; with this advantage, that they may here in safety
   read what with great danger they formerly heard.

   I have admired, and must recommend to the observation of the reader,
   the fruitfulness of the author's holy invention, accompanied with solid
   judgment; in that whereas the coincidence of the matter in this psalm
   might have superseded his labours in very many verses, yet, without
   force or offering violence to the sacred text, he has, either from the
   connection of one verse with its predecessor, or the harmony between
   the parts of the same verse, found out new matter to entertain his own
   meditation and his reader's expectation; nor do I observe more than
   twelve verses in this large psalm wholly omitted, if at least they may
   be said to be omitted, whose subject-matter is elsewhere copiously
   handled.

   Had the reverend author designed these papers for public view, he could
   not have flattered himself, in a cavilling age, that he should escape
   the severe lashes of envy and malice (those fiends that haunt all
   things and persons excellent); he must have expected a snarl from the
   wolf's black mouth, or a kick from the dull ass's hoof. Yet on his
   behalf I demand this justice, that he be not condemned for the
   printers' crimes. Their venial errors will receive a pardon of course
   from the ingenuous reader; and for their mortal transgressions, whereof
   they are sometimes guilty, either clouding, altering, or perverting the
   scope of the author, enjoin them, gentle reader, a moderate penance,
   and then receive them to full absolution, who have voluntarily offered
   themselves to confession.

   Thus much, Christian reader, it was thy interest and mine to have
   spoken; the rest must be to the God of all grace, that he would give
   thee and this book his blessing; which is the prayer of thy
   affectionate friend and faithful servant in our Lord Jesus,

   V. A. [1]

                     SEVERAL SERMONS UPON THE CXIX. PSALM.

SERMON I.

   Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk m the law of the
   Lord.--Ver. 1.

   THIS psalm is a choice piece of Scripture. In the Hebrew there is much
   exactness of composure to be observed. It is divided into twenty-two
   parts, according to the number of the Hebrew letters; every part
   containeth eight verses, all beginning with one and the same letter; in
   which I should think there is nothing of mystery intended, only a help
   to attention and memory. I shall go over the several verses in their
   order, the Lord giving life and assistance. And because the same matter
   will be of frequent recourse, I shall endeavour to discuss each verse
   in a sermon.

   The Psalmist beginneth with a description of the way to true
   blessedness, as Christ began his Sermon on the Mount, and as the whole
   Book of Psalms is elsewhere begun. Blessedness is that which we all aim
   at, only we are either ignorant or reckless of the way that leadeth to
   it; therefore the holy Psalmist would first set us right in the true
   notion of a blessed man: Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk
   in the law of the Lord.'

   In the words you have--

   1. The privilege, blessed.

   2. The manner and form of its consideration; not so much in the nature
   and formality of it, as the way that leadeth to it. Or,

   First, Here is a way spoken of in the general.

   Secondly, This way specified, the law of the Lord.

   Thirdly, The qualification of the persons' sincerity, the undefiled;
   and constancy, who walk.

   Doct. 1. That it standeth us much upon to have a true notion of
   blessedness and blessed men. David beginneth with that.

   1. All desire it; Christians, pagans, all agree in this. When Paul was
   dealing with the heathens, he urgeth two notions wherein God might be
   taken up. That of a first cause: Acts xiv. 17, Nevertheless he left not
   himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from
   heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and
   gladness.' And a chief good, Acts xvii. 27. As in the one place, there
   must be a cause of showers of rain and fruitful seasons; so in the
   other, there must be a universal good, or else the inclinations of
   nature were in vain. Among Christians, the good and bad, that do so
   seldom agree in anything, yet agree in this, every man would be happy,
   and not miserable: Ps. iv. 6, There be many that say, Who will show us
   any good?' Good, good, is the cry of the world. It is intended in the
   very nature of desire; for everything that is desired is desired as
   good, sub ratione boni. As God implanted in us affections of aversation
   to avoid what is evil, so affections of choice and pursuit to follow
   after what is good. Well, then, out of a principle of self-love, all
   would be happy; they would have good, and they would have it for ever.
   Inanimate creatures are, by the guidance and direction of Providence,
   carried to the place of their perfection. The brute beasts seek the
   preservation and perfection of that life which they have; so do all men
   hunt about for contentment and satisfaction. To ask whether men would
   be happy or not, is to ask whether they love themselves, yea or nay;
   but whether holy, is another thing.

   2. All without grace are much mistaken in it. (1.) Some mistake in the
   end. They desire good in common, not that which is indeed the true
   good; they seek happiness in riches, honours, pleasures; and so they
   fly from that which they seek, whilst they seek it. They intend
   happiness, but choose misery: Luke xvi. 25, Thy good things;' and Ps.
   iv. 7, Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that
   their corn and wine increased.' Their corn, wine, and oil, not only
   possessed by them, but chosen by them as their felicity and portion.
   (2.) They fail in the means. They know them not, like them not, or else
   faint in the prosecution of the end by them. They discern them but
   weakly, as a spire at a distance; they see it so as they know not
   whether they see it, yea or nay, as the blind man saw men walking as
   trees. The light of nature being so dim, they consider them but weakly;
   the mind being diverted by other objects, they desire them but weakly;
   the affections being prepossessed and intercepted by things that come
   next to hand, velleities and cold inclinations they may have, but no
   serious volition or firm bent of heart. Or suppose a man under some
   conviction, both as to end and means, yet his endeavours are very cold
   and slack; they do not pursue it with that earnestness, exactness, and
   uniformity of endeavour which is requisite to obtain their happiness.
   They are like children that seem to desire a thing passionately, but
   are soon out of humour: The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath
   nothing, for his hands refuse to labour.' When true happiness is
   sufficiently revealed, we like it not upon God's terms, John vi. 34.
   The Jews, when our Saviour told them of the bread of God that came down
   from heaven to give life to the world, said unto him, Lord, evermore
   give us of this bread.' But it is said, upon hearing the conditions of
   obtaining it, ver. 66, they murmured, went back, and walked no more
   with him.' All would live for ever; but when they must follow a
   despised Christ up and down the world, and incur censures and dangers,
   they like none of that: Ps. cvi. 24, Yea, they despised the pleasant
   land, and believed not his word.' The land was a good land, but the way
   to it was through a howling wilderness. When they heard of the strength
   and stature of the men, their fortifications, they fell into passion
   and murmur, and gave over the pursuit of Canaan. Heaven is a good
   place, but men must get to it with such difficulty, therefore they are
   loath to be at the cost. Men would be happy with that kind of happiness
   which is true happiness, but not in the way which God propoundeth,
   being prepossessed with carnal fancies. It is counted a foolish thing
   to wait upon God in the midst of straits, conflicts, and temptations: 1
   Cor. ii. 14, The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of
   God, for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know them,
   because they are spiritually discerned.' More prejudices lie against
   the means than the end; therefore, out of despair, they sit down with a
   carnal choice, as persons disappointed in a match take the next offer.
   Since they cannot have God's happiness, they resolve to be their own
   carvers, and to make themselves as happy as they can in the enjoyment
   of present things.

   3. Our mistakes about it will cost us dear. God is very jealous of what
   we make our happiness, and therefore blasteth the carnal choice. Those
   that will try experiments, smart for it in the issue. Solomon came home
   by weeping-cross: Eccles. i. 14, I have seen all the works that are
   done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.'
   He hath proved it to our hands. He had a large heart, and a large
   estate, and gave himself to pleasures, to extract happiness from the
   creatures, to hunt after worldly satisfactions in a more artificial way
   than brutish sots, that merely act according to lust and appetite:
   Eccles. ii. 1, I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with
   mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure; and behold, this also is vanity.' He
   gave himself to pleasures, not merely upon sensual, but curious and
   artificial aims, yet found his heart secretly withdrawn from God.
   Whoever maketh trial will either run into utter mischief, or must come
   home again by a sound remorse. And so they learn it, and dearly to
   their cost.

   Use. Let us study this point well.

   1. That we may not take up with a false happiness, or set up our rest
   in temporal enjoyments, as height of honour, abundance of riches,
   favour of great men, &c.; things useful in their sphere, and beneficial
   to sweeten and comfort the life of man, who hath placed his happiness
   in God. Pleasures being enjoyed, they do not satisfy; being loved, they
   defile; being lost, they increase our trouble and sorrow.

   [1.] They cannot satisfy, because of their imperfection and
   uncertainty. They do not answer the whole desire of man, carry no
   proportion with the conscience. That which maketh a man happy must bear
   a thorough proportion with all the wants, desires, and capacities of
   the soul, so as conscience and heart and all may say it is enough. But,
   alas! these things cannot give us solid peace and contentment: Isa. lv.
   2, Wherefore do ye spend your money for that which is not bread? and
   your labour for that which satisfieth not?' Till an hungry conscience
   be provided for, we cannot be happy. But besides their low use,
   consider the uncertainty of enjoyment. Nothing can give us solid peace,
   but what doth make us eternally happy. These flowers our hands while we
   smell at them. Nothing but the favour of God is from everlasting to
   everlasting. We have not a sure possession of these things in the
   world. They are possessed with fear, 1 Cor. vii. 30, 3l. It is me
   apostle's counsel, that they that buy' should have such remiss
   affections to the world, as though they possessed not; and that they
   use this world as not abusing it, for the fashion of this world passeth
   away.' A man must look for changes, and lay forth for several
   conditions in the world: Ps. xxxix 11, When thou with rebukes dost
   correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a
   moth. Surely every man is vanity. Selah.' Like glass, brittle when most
   glistering.

   [2.] Being inordinately loved, they defile. There is not only gall, but
   poison in them. They cannot make us better, but may easily make us
   worse, as they defile and draw the heart from God, and enslave us to
   our own lusts: 1 Tim. vi. 9, 10, But they that will be rich, fall into
   temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which
   drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the
   root of all evil, which, while some have coveted after, they have erred
   from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.'

   [3.] Being lost, they increase our trouble and sorrow. A man that hath
   not learned to be abased, as well as to abound, his abundance maketh
   his case the more miserable. It is hard to go back a degree or two.
   They are apt to bring much trouble upon the heart of him that is
   conversant about them: All is vanity and vexation of spirit.' The more
   we make them our happiness, when lost they increase our trouble.

   2. That we may not be prejudiced against the true happiness. Men think
   it a happiness to live without the yoke of religion, to speak, and
   think, and do what they please without restraint; but to be always in
   bonds, and held under the awe of the word, that they count unreason
   able and grievous: Ps. ii. 3, Let us break their bands asunder, and
   cast away their cords from us.' In studying this point--(1.) Lean not
   to thine own understanding;' Prov. xxiii. 4, Labour not to be rich;
   cease from thy own wisdom;' but seek direction from God by his word and
   Spirit. God only can determine who is the blessed man, in whose hand
   alone it is to make us blessed. (2.) Take the light of faith; sense and
   carnal reason will deceive you. Blessedness is a riddle which can only
   be found out by faith, which is the evidence of things not seen,' Heb.
   xi. 1. That a poor godly man, who is counted the filth and offscouring
   of all things, should be the only happy man, and that the great men of
   this world, who have all things at will, should be poor, blind,
   miserable, and naked,' is a paradox will never enter into the heart of
   a natural man, that hath only the light of sense and carnal reason to
   judge of things, for to sight and reason it is nothing so. (3.) Wait
   for the light and power of the Spirit to incline and draw thy heart to
   God. Many times we are doctrinally right in point of blessedness, but
   not practically; we content ourselves with the mere notion, but are not
   brought under the power of these truths; that is the work of the
   Spirit. It is easy to prove that it is the beasts' happiness to enjoy
   pleasure without remorse; easy to prove the uncertainty of riches, and
   what unstable foundations they are for the soul to rest on; but to draw
   off the heart from these things to God is the work of the Holy Ghost:
   Ps. xlix. 13, This their way is their folly, yet their posterity
   approve their sayings.' Many a man who stands over the grave of his
   ancestors will say, Ah! how foolish were they to waste their time and
   strength in pleasure, and in hunting after worldly greatness and esteem
   and favour with men; what doth it profit them now? And yet their
   posterity approve the same--that is, they live by the same principles,
   are as greedy upon worldly satisfactions as ever those were that have
   gone before, that neglected God and heavenly things, and went down to
   the grave, and their honour was laid in the dust. Until the Lord take
   off our heart by the light and power of his grace, we remain as sottish
   and foolish and worldly as they. Thus you see how much it concerns you
   to be right in the notion of true blessedness.

   Doct. 2. That sincere, constant, uniform obedience to God's law is the
   only way to true blessedness.

   This is called a way, and this way is said to be God's law, and m this
   way we must be undefiled; which implies not absolute purity and legal
   perfection, but gospel sincerity; and in this way we must walk, which
   notes both uniformity and constancy; it must be our course, and we must
   persevere therein.

   Three things need to be opened:--

   1. Speak to the rule.

   2. Of conformity to the rule; that it must be sincere, uniform, and
   constant.

   3. How this is the way to true happiness; what respect it hath to true
   blessedness.

   First, The rule is the law of God. All created beings have a rule.
   Christ's human nature was the highest of all creatures, and yet it is
   to be in subjection to God; he is under a rule: Gal. iv. 4, Made of a
   woman, made under the law.' The angels they have many immunities above
   man; they are freed from death, from the necessities of meat and drink;
   but they are not free from the law; they are not sui juris, at their
   own dispose; they obey his commands, hearkening unto the voice of his
   word,' Ps. ciii. 20. Inanimate creatures, sun, moon, stars, are under a
   law of providence, under a covenant of night and day: Ps. cxlix. 6, He
   has also stablished them for ever; he hath made a decree which shall
   not pass.' They have their courses and appointed motions, and keep to
   the just points of their compass. All creatures are under a law,
   according to which they move and act. Much more now is man under a law,
   because he hath election and choice. But if the law were not a rule to
   a Christian (as some Antinomians have that opinion), if it were not in
   force, then there should be no sin or duty; for where there is no law,
   there is no transgression;' for the nature of sin is the transgression
   of the law,' 1 John iii. 4; Rom. iv. 15. Certainly the law as a rule is
   a very great privilege; and surely Christ did not come to lessen or
   abolish the privileges of his people: Deut. iv. 4, There is no nation
   hath such statutes;' Ps. cxlvii. 20, He hath made known his statutes to
   Israel,' was their prerogative. If the law might be disannulled as to
   new creatures, then why doth the Spirit of God write it with such
   legible characters in their hearts? This is promised as the great
   blessing of the covenant of grace, Heb. viii. 10. Now, that which the
   Spirit engraves upon the heart, would Christ come to deface and
   abolish? The law was written upon tables of stone, and the great work
   of the spirit is to write it upon the table of the heart; and the ark
   was a chest where the law was kept, and with allusion to it God saith,
   I will put my law into their heart.' Clearly, then, there is a rule,
   and this rule is the law of God. Now, this rule must be consulted with
   upon all occasions, if we would obtain true blessedness, both to inform
   us, and to awe us.

   First, To inform us, that we may not act short or over.

   1. Not short. There are many false rules with which men please
   themselves, and are but so many byways that lead us off from our own
   happiness. For instance, good meaning, that is a false rule; the world
   lives by guess and devout aims. But if good meaning were a rule, a man
   may oppose the interest of Christ, destroy his servants, and all upon
   good meaning: John xvi. 2, Those that kill you will think they do God
   good service.' Men may grossly err that follow a blind conscience.
   Custom, that is another. It is no matter what others have done before
   us, but what Christ did before them all. If custom carried it, most of
   Christ's institutions would be out of doors. Example of others; that is
   no good rule. It is not for us to go where others have gone before; but
   what is the true way: Mat. vii. 14, The broad way, that leads to
   destruction, and many walk therein.' The path to hell is most beaten;
   we are not always to follow the track; they are dead fishes which swim
   down the stream: we are not to be led away with custom and example, and
   do as others do. Our own desires and inclinations are not our rule. Oh,
   how miserable should we be if our lust were our law, if the bent of our
   hearts were our rule! Jude 16, Walking after their own lusts,' is the
   description of those that were monsters of men, that had outgrown all
   feelings of conscience. The laws of men are not our rule. It is too
   narrow and short to commend us to God, to be punctual to the laws of
   men and no more: Ps. xix. 7, The law of God is perfect, converting the
   soul.' To convince us of sin, to humble the heart, to reduce and bring
   us back to God, there is no rule for this but the law of God. Men make
   laws as tailors do garments, to fit the crooked bodies they serve for,
   to suit the humours of the people to be governed by these laws; surely
   they are not a sufficient rule to convince us of sin, and to guide us
   to true happiness. A civil orderly man is one thing, and a godly
   renewed man another. It is God's prerogative to give a law to the
   conscience and the renewed motions of the heart. Human laws are good to
   establish converse with man, but too short to establish communion with
   God; and, therefore, we must consult with the rule, which is the law of
   the Lord, that we may not come short of true blessedness.

   2. That we may not act over. There is a superstitious and apocryphal
   holiness which is contrary to a genuine and scriptural holiness, yea,
   destructive to it: it is like the concubine to the wife: it draws away
   respects due to the true religion. Now, what is this kind of holiness?
   It is a temporary flesh-pleasing religion, which consists in a
   conformity to outward rites and ceremonies and external mortifications,
   such as is practised by the Papists and formalists, after the
   commandments and doctrines of men:' Col. ii. 23, Which things indeed
   have a show of wisdom in will-worship, and humility, and neglecting of
   the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.' God will
   not thank them that give more than he requireth. These things have a
   show of wisdom. As brass money may be fairer than true coin, though not
   of such a value, so this will-worship and superstitious holiness may
   seem to make a fair show, but it is destructive to true godliness and
   scriptural holiness, which guide us to communion with God. When men's
   zeal boils over in a false pretended holiness, it quencheth the fire
   and destroys true godliness and religion. Excess is monstrous, as well
   as defect. Therefore still we must consult with the law and rule, that
   we may not come short or over.

   Secondly, As the law must be consulted with, that it may inform us, so
   that it may awe us, and hold us under a sense of our duty to God: By
   the law is the knowledge of sin.' Rom. iii. 19. Usually most Christians
   live by rote, and do not study their rule. Would a man worship God so
   coldly and customarily, if he did consider the rule which requires such
   heedfulness of soul, fervency of spirit, diligent attendance upon God
   in his ordinances? Would a man allow himself liberty of vain speeches,
   idle talk, and suffer his tongue to run riot, if he did consult with
   the rule, and remembered that light words would weigh heavy in God's
   balance? These are condemned by the law of liberty: James ii. 12, So
   speak, and so do, as those that shall be judged by the law of liberty.'
   Would a man be so slight in heavenly things? so disorderly and
   intemperate in the use of pleasure and pursuit of worldly profit, if he
   did consider the rule, and what a holy moderation God hath required of
   us upon all occasions? This is the first thing, namely, the rule, which
   is the law of God.

   Secondly, There is a conformity to this rule. If you would be blessed,
   there must be a sincere, constant, uniform obedience. The will of God
   must not only be known but practised. Many will conclude that God's law
   in the theory is the only direction to true blessedness; but now, to
   take it for their rule, to keep close to it, not one of a thousand doth
   that.

   1. Then, sincere obedience is required: Blessed is the undefiled in the
   way.' At first hearing of these words, a man might reply, Oh, then,
   none can be blessed, if that be the qualification; for who can say, My
   heart is clean?' Prov. xx. 9. I answer--This undefiledness is to be
   understood according to the tenor of the second covenant, which doth
   not exclude the mercy of God and the justification of penitent sinners:
   Ps. cxxx. 3, 4, If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, who shall
   stand? But there is mercy with thee.' There is no escaping condemnation
   and the curse, if God should deal with us according to strict justice,
   and require an absolute undefiledness. Well, then, this qualification
   must be understood, as I said, in the sense of the second covenant; and
   what is that? Sincerity of sanctification. When a man doth carefully
   endeavour to keep his garments unspotted from the world, and to approve
   himself to God; when this is his constant exercise, to avoid all
   offence both towards God and man, Acts xxiv. 16, and is cautious and
   watchful lest he should be defiled; when he is humbled more for his
   pollutions; when he is always purging his heart, and doth endeavour,
   and that with success, to walk m the way of God,--here is the
   undefiledness in a gospel sense: Ps. lxxxiv. 11 The Lord will be a sun
   and a shield,' &c. To whom? To those that walk uprightly.' This is
   possible enough; here is no ground of despair. This is that will lead
   us to blessedness, when we are troubled for our failings, and there is
   a diligent exercise in the purification of our hearts.

   2. A constant obedience. Wicked men have their good moods and devout
   pangs in the way to heaven, but they are not lasting. They will go with
   God a step or two. But it is said, He that walketh in the law of the
   Lord.' A wicked man prays himself weary of prayer, and professeth
   himself weary of holiness. A man is judged by the tenor of his life;
   not by one action, but as he holdeth on his way to heaven, Job xxvii.
   10. Many run well for a while, but are soon out of breath. Enoch walked
   with God three hundred and sixty-five years.

   3. A uniform and an entire obedience: Exod. xx. 1, God spake all these
   words.' He commandeth one thing as well as another, and conscience
   takes hold of all. To single out what pleaseth us is to make ourselves
   gods.

   A servant doth not choose his work, but the master. A child of God is
   uniform in one place as well as another, at home and abroad, in all the
   passages of his life, in prosperity and adversity, whether he abound,
   or whether he be abased,' Phil. iv. He is not like Ephraim as a cake
   not turned;' but there is a uniformity. Doth he make conscience of
   piety and worship, and will he not make conscience of honesty and just
   dealing with men? Will he make conscience of his actions, and will he
   not of his words? He doth not give up himself to idle speech and vain
   discourse. A hypocrite is best when he is taken in pieces, but a
   sincere man is best when he is taken altogether. A Christian is always
   like himself. It is notable in the story of the creation that God views
   every day's work, and God saw that it was good;' he viewed it
   altogether, and God saw all things that he had made, and behold it was
   very good.' When he did consider the whole correspondence of his works,
   how they answered one another, then God was delighted in it. So a
   Christian is most delighted in the review of his course and walking
   according to the commandment.

   Thirdly, What respect hath this to true blessedness? It is the way to
   it: Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the
   Lord.' This will appear in two respects--(1.) It is the beginning of
   blessedness. Likeness to God is the foundation of glory. Conformity to
   him will be carried on from glory to glory,' 2 Cor. iii. 18. And as
   conformity unto, so communion with, God in the beauties of holiness is
   the beginning of happiness: As for me, I will behold thy face in
   righteousness; I shall be satisfied when I awake with thy likeness,'
   Ps. xvii. 15. (2.) Sincere and constant obedience is the evidence of
   our right to future blessedness. A man hath somewhat to show for it,
   Mat. v. 8. It is an inclusive evidence: Blessed are the pure in heart,
   for they shall see God;' and it is an exclusive evidence: Heb. xii. 14,
   Without holiness no man shall see the Lord.' Well, then, when this is
   our way and course, we may expect happiness hereafter.

   The uses are--

   1. To show you that carnal men live as if they sought misery rather
   than happiness: Prov. viii. 36, He that sins against me wrongs his own
   soul; all that hate me love death.' If a man were travelling to York,
   who would say his aim was to come to London? Do these men pursue
   happiness that walk in such defilement? It is the way of God's law that
   leads to true blessedness.

   2. To press you to walk according to this rule, if you would be
   blessed. To this end let me press you to take the law of God for your
   rule, the Spirit of God for your guide, the promises for your
   encouragement, and the glory of God for your end.

   [1.] Take the law of God for your rule. Study the mind of God, and know
   the way to heaven, and keep exactly in it. It is an argument of
   sincerity when a man is careful to practise all that he knows, and to
   be inquisitive to know more, even the whole will of God, and when the
   heart is held under awe of God's word. If a commandment stand in the
   way, it is more to a gracious heart than if a thousand bears and lions
   were in the way--more than if an angel stood in the way with a flaming
   sword: Prov. xiii. 13, He that feareth the commandment shall be
   rewarded.' Would you have blessings from God?--fear the commandment. It
   is not he that fears wrath, punishment, inconveniences, troubles of the
   world, molestations of the flesh; no, but he that dares riot make bold
   with a commandment. As Jer. xxxv. 6, Go, bring a temptation, set pots
   of wine before the Rechabites. Oh, they durst not drink of them. Why?
   Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, Ye shall
   drink no wine.' Thus a child of God doth reason when the devil comes
   and sets a temptation before him, and being zealous for God, dares not
   comply with the lusts and humours of men, though they should promise
   him peace, happiness, and plenty. A wicked man makes no bones of a
   commandment; but a godly man, when he is in a right posture of spirit,
   and the awe of God is upon him, dare not knowingly and wittingly go
   aside and depart from God.

   [2.] Take the Spirit of God for your guide. We can never walk in God's
   way without the conduct of God's Spirit. We must not only have a way,
   but a voice to direct us when we are wandering: Isa. xxx. 21, And thine
   ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk in
   it.' Sheep have a shepherd as well as a fold, and children that learn
   to write must have a teacher as well as a copy; and so it is not enough
   to have a rule, but we must have a guide, a monitor, to put us in mind
   of our duty. The Israelites had a pillar of cloud by day, and a pillar
   of fire by night. The gospel church is not destitute of a guide: Ps.
   xxxvii. 24, Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterwards
   receive me to glory.' The Spirit of God is the guide and director to
   warn us of our duty.

   [3.] The promises for your encouragement. If you look elsewhere, live
   by sense, and not by faith, you shall have discouragements enough. How
   shall a man carry himself through the temptations of the world with
   honour to God? 2 Pet. i. 4, Whereby are given unto us exceeding great
   and precious promises, that by these ye might be partakers of the
   divine nature, having escaped the corruptions that are in the world
   through lust.' When we have promises to bear us up, this will carry us
   clear through temptations, and make us act generously, nobly, and keep
   close to him.

   [4] Fix the glory of God for your aim; else it is but a carnal course.
   The spiritual life is a living to God, Gal. ii. 20, when he is made the
   end of every action. You have a journey to take, and whether you sleep
   or wake, your journey is still a-going. As in a ship, whether men sit,
   lie, or walk, whether they eat or sleep, the ship holds on its course,
   and makes towards its port , so you all are going into another world,
   either to heaven or hell, the broad or the narrow way. And then do but
   consider how comfortable it will be at your journey's end, in a dying
   hour, to have been undefiled in the way; then wicked men that are
   defiled in their way will wish they had kept more close and exact with
   God. Even those that now wonder at the niceness and zeal of others,
   when they see that they must in earnest into another world, oh, then
   that they had been more exact and watchful, and stuck closer to the
   rule in their practice, discourses, compliances! Men will have other
   notions then of holiness than they had before. Oh, then they will wish
   that they had been more circumspect. Christ commended the unjust
   steward for remembering that in time he should be put out of his
   stewardship. You will all fail within a little while; then your poor,
   shiftless, naked souls must launch out into another world, and
   immediately come to God. How comfortable will it be then to have walked
   closely according to the line of obedience!

   Doct. 3. That a close walker not only shall be blessed, but is blessed,
   in hand as well as in hope.

   How is he blessed?

   1. He is freed from wrath. He hath his discharge, and the blessedness
   of a pardoned man: John v. 24, He that believeth on Christ hath
   everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, for he hath
   passed from death to life.' He is out of danger of perishing, which is
   a great mercy.

   2. He is taken into favour and respect with God: John xv. 14, Ye are my
   friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.' There is a real friendship
   made up between us and Christ, not only in point of harmony and
   agreement of mind, but mutual delight and fellowship with each other.

   3. He is under the special care and conduct of God's providence, that
   he may not miscarry: 1 Cor. iii. 23, All things are yours, and ye are
   Christ's, and Christ is God's.' All the conditions of his life are
   overruled for good; his blessings are sanctified, and his miseries
   unstinged: Rom. viii. 28, And we know that all things work together for
   good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his
   purpose.'

   4. He hath a sure covenant-right to everlasting glory: 1 John iii. 1,
   Behold, now are we the sons of God; and it doth not yet appear what we
   shall be,' &c. Is a title nothing before we come to enjoy the estate?
   We count a worldly heir happy, as well as a possessor; and are not
   God's heirs happy?

   5. He hath sweet experiences of God's goodness towards him here in this
   world: Ps. xvii. 15, As for me, I will behold thy face in
   righteousness; I shall be satisfied when I awake with thy likeness.'
   The joy of the presence and sense of the Lord's love will counter
   balance all worldly joys.

   6. He hath a great deal of peace: Gal. vi. 16, And as many as walk
   according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the
   Israel of God.' Obedience and holy walking bringeth peace: Great peace
   have they which love thy law, and nothing shall offend them,' Ps. cxix.
   165; as there is peace in nature when all things keep their place and
   order. This peace others cannot have. There is a difference between a
   dead sea and a calm sea. A stupid conscience they may have, not a quiet
   conscience. The virtue of that opium will soon be spent; conscience
   will again be awakened.

   Use. Oh, then, let us put in for a share of this blessedness! There are
   two encouragements in the service of Christ--our vails and our wages.
   Our wages should be enough, the eternal enjoyment of himself. But oh!
   we cry out of the tediousness of the way. We have our vails also, that
   are not contemptible. If a man should offer a lordship or farm to
   another, and he should say, The way is dirty and dangerous, the weather
   very troublesome; I will not look after it--would you not accuse this
   man of folly, that loves his ease and pleasure? But now, if this man
   were assured of a pleasant path and good way, if he would but take a
   little pains to go over and see it, this were gross folly indeed to
   refuse it. Our Lord hath made over a blessed inheritance to us upon
   gospel terms; but we are full of prejudices, in that to keep close to
   the rule may bring trouble, and deprive us of many advantages of gain;
   and we think we shall never see good day more. But we are assured there
   is a great blessing goeth along with God's yoke; and we having a
   promise of the enjoyment of God's presence where there are pleasures
   for evermore, this should make us rouse up ourselves in the work of the
   Lord.

SERMON II.

   Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, that seek him with the
   whole heart.--Ver. 2.

   IN this psalm the man of God begins with a description of the way to
   true blessedness. In the former verse a blessed man is described by the
   course of his actions, Blessed are the undefiled in the way.' In this,
   by the frame of his heart, Blessed are they that keep his testimonies,
   that seek him with the whole heart.' The internal principle of good
   actions is the verity and purity of the heart.

   Here you may take notice of two marks of a blessed man:--

   1. They keep his testimonies.

   2. They seek him with the whole heart.

   Doct. 1. They that keep close to God's testimonies are blessed.

   By way of explication, two things take notice of:--

   1. The notion that is given to precepts and counsels in the word: they
   are called his testimonies.

   2. The respect of the blessed man to these testimonies, to keep them.

   First, The notion by which the word of God is expressed is testimonies,
   whereby is intended the whole declaration of Gods will, in doctrines,
   commands, examples, threatenings, promises. The whole word is the
   testimony which God hath deposed for the satisfaction of the world
   about the way of their salvation. Now, because the word of God
   brancheth itself into two parts, the law and the gospel, this notion
   may be applied to both. First, To the law, in regard whereof the ark is
   called the ark of the testimony,' Exod. xxv. 16, because the two tables
   were laid up in it The gospel is also called the testimony, the
   testimony of God concerning his Son:' Isa. viii. 20, To the law, and to
   the testimony;' where testimony seems to be distinguished from the law.
   The gospel is so called, because there God hath testified how a man
   shall be pardoned, reconciled to God, and obtain a right to eternal
   life. We need a testimony in this case, because it is more unknown to
   us. The law was written upon the heart* but the gospel is a stranger.
   Natural light will discern something of the law, and pry into matters
   which are of a moral strain and concernment; but evangelical truths are
   a mystery, and depend [2] by the mere testimony of God concerning his
   Son. Now, from this notion of testimonies we have this advantage:--

   [1.] That the word is a full declaration of the Lord's mind. God would
   not leave us in the dark in the matters which concern the service of
   God and man's salvation. He hath given us his testimony, he hath told
   us his mind, what he approves and what he disallows, and upon what
   terms he will accept of sinners in Christ. It is a blessed thing that
   we are not left to the uncertainty of our own thoughts: Micah vi. 8, He
   hath showed thee, O man, what is good.' The way of pleasing and
   enjoying God is clearly revealed in his word. There we may know what we
   must do, what we may expect, and upon what terms. We have his
   testimony.

   [2.] Another advantage we have by this notion is the certainty of the
   word; it is God's testimony. The apostle saith, 1 John v. 9, If we take
   the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater.' It is but
   reason we should allow God that value and esteem that we give to the
   testimony of men, who are fallible and deceitful. Among men, in the
   mouth of two or three witnesses everything is established,' Deut. xix.
   15;' Now there are three that bear witness in heaven, and three that
   bear witness on earth,' 1 John v. 8. We are apt to doubt of the gospel,
   and have suspicious thoughts of such an excellent doctrine; but now
   there are three witnesses from heaven, the Father, Word, and Spirit;
   the Father by a voice: Mat. iii. 7, And lo, a voice from heaven saying,
   This is my beloved Son,' &c. And the Son also by a voice, when he
   appeared to Paul from heaven, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?' And
   the Holy Ghost gave his testimony, descending upon him in the form of a
   dove, and upon the apostles in cloven tongues of fire. And there are
   three that bear record on earth;' for he saith, 1 John v. 10, He that
   believeth, echei ten marturian he hath the testimony in himself.' What
   is that? The Spirit, water, and blood in the heart of a believer; these
   give testimony to the gospel. The Spirit bears witness to the gospel
   when it illuminateth the heart, enabling us to discern the doctrine to
   be of God, to discern those signatures and characters of majesty,
   goodness, power, truth, which God hath left upon the gospel; and water
   and blood testify when we feel those constant and sensible effects of
   God's power coming with the gospel (1 Thes. i. 5), both by pacifying
   the conscience, and bringing joy and satisfaction, and by sanctifying
   and freeing a man from the bondage of sin. Water signifies
   sanctification: John xvii. 17, Sanctify them by thy truth.' The
   sanctifying power of God, that goes along with the gospel, is a clear
   confirmation of the divine testimony in it: John viii. 32, The truth
   shall make you free.' By our disentanglement from lust we come to be
   settled in the truth. God's testimony is the ultimate resolution of our
   faith. Why do we believe? Because it is God's testimony. How do we know
   it is God's testimony? It evidenceth itself by its own light to the
   consciences of men; yet God for the greater satisfaction to the world,
   hath given us witnesses, three from heaven and three on earth. Every
   manifestation of God hath sig natures and characters of God enough upon
   it to show from whence it came. The creation is a manifestation of God;
   now, whoever looks upon it seriously and considerately, may find God
   there, may track him by his footprints, By the things which are made,
   his invisible being and power.' Rom. i. 20. The creation discovers
   itself to be of God; and if the lower testimony hath plain evidences,
   much more the gospel. Why? For he hath magnified his word above all his
   name,' Ps. cxxxviii. 2. The name of God is that by which he is made
   known. Now, there are more sensible characters and impressions of God
   left upon the word, that doth evidence it to be of God, than upon any
   part of his name.

   [3.] This advantage we have by this notion, a testimony is a ground of
   self-examination, or a rule whereby we may judge of our state and
   actions; for it witnesseth not only de jure, what we must do; or de
   eventu, what we may expect; but de facto, whether we do good or evil,
   what we are, and what we may look for from God upon our obedience or
   disobedience: Mat. xxiv. 14, The gospel of the kingdom shall be
   preached in all the world, eis marturion , for a witness unto all
   nations;' first to them, next against them, Mark xiii. 9. The word is a
   testimony to them of God's will in Christ, if they receive it; against
   them if they reject, neglect, or believe it not. Hereby we may judge of
   our condition by our conformity, or difformity and contrariety, to the
   word of God. Christ saith at the day of judgment Moses will accuse you:
   John v. 45, There is one that accuseth you, even Moses in whom ye
   trust.' The gospel will accuse. What is now an offer will then be an
   accusation. God will not be without a witness at the day of judgment.
   The creatures, which had an evident impression of God upon them, they
   will witness against the Gentiles, so that they are without excuse.'
   Rom. i. 20; and the Jews, that were under the dispensation of Moses, he
   will accuse them; there was light sufficient to convince them. So the
   gospel, which is God's testimony concerning his Son, will accuse you if
   it be not received. Therefore it is good to see what the word doth
   witness or testify; doth it testify good or evil? for accordingly shall
   we be treated with in the day of judgment. It is sad when we can only
   say of the scripture as that kin of the prophet of the Lord, He
   witnesseth nothing but evil against me,' 1 Kings xxii. 8. Let us see
   what God's testimony speaks, whether it will plead for us or against us
   at the great day of the Lord.

   [4.] It upbraids our unbelief, that when God hath not only given us a
   law, but a testimony, still we are backward and careless, word of God
   were no more but a law, we were bound to obey it, be cause we are his
   creatures; but when it is his testimony, we should regard it the more,
   for now God stands not only upon the honour of his authority, but of
   his truth: 1 John v. 10 He that believeth not hath made God a liar,
   because he believeth not the testimony which (rod hath given concerning
   his Son.' We may urge it thus upon our hearts--What! shall we make God
   a liar, after he hath so solemnly given his word, that word which hath
   many signatures, characters, and stamps of God upon it? Carelessness
   now is not only disobedience, but unbelief; it puts the highest affront
   upon God, to question his veracity and truth, and does not only unlord
   him, but ungod him, by making him a liar.

   So much for the first thing, the testimony of the Lord.

   Secondly, The respect of the blessed man to these testimonies; they
   keep them. What is it to keep the testimonies of God? Keeping is a word
   which relates to a charge or trust committed to us. Christ hath
   committed his testimonies to us as a trust and charge that we must be
   careful of. Look, as on our part we commit to Christ the charge of our
   souls to save them in his own day, 2 Tim. i. 12, so Christ chargeth us
   with his word--(1.) To lay it up in our hearts. (2.) To observe it in
   our practice. This is to keep the word.

   [1.] To lay it up in our hearts. In the heart two things are
   considerable--the understanding and the affections. God undertakes in
   the covenant for both: Heb. viii. 10, I will put my law in their mind,
   and write it in their hearts.' The meaning is, that he will enlighten
   our minds for the understanding of his will, and frame our affections
   to the obedience of it. Well, then, you must keep it in your minds and
   affections.

   (1.) In your minds. We must understand the word of God, assent to it;
   we must revolve it often in our thoughts, and have it ready upon all
   occasions. Understand it we must if we would be blessed: He that hath
   my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me,' John xiv.
   21. We cannot make conscience of obedience till we know our duty. He
   that would keep a thing must first have it; we have the law in
   possession when we get knowledge of it: Mat. xiii. 23, He that
   receiveth the word into good ground is he that heareth the word and
   understands it;' and Luke viii. 13, They that hear the word and keep
   it, and bring forth fruit with patience.' It is not enough to hear the
   word, but we must understand it; and yet that is not all: an adversary
   may understand a truth, or else he cannot rationally oppose it. There
   is assent required, that we believe it as God's testimony, and
   accordingly embrace it, and give it place in the heart. Faith is a
   receiving of the word, Acts ii. 41; nay,' we must have it ready upon
   all occasions. Rational memory belongs to the mind or understanding;
   therefore we keep the word in our minds when it is ever ready with us,
   either to check sin, or warn us of our duty, Ps. cxix. 9. Forgetfulness
   is an ignorance for the time: Prov. iii. 1, My son, forget not my law;
   and let thine heart keep my commandments.' We should be ready to every
   good word and work, as occasion is offered to us.

   (2.) To keep it in our hearts is to have an affection to it. Keeping
   the word relates to our chariness and tenderness of it, when we are as
   chary of the word as a man would be of a precious jewel: Prov. vi. 20,
   21, My son, keep thy father's commandments; bind them continually upon
   thine heart, and tie them about thy neck.' Sometimes it alludes to the
   apple of the eye: Prov. vii. 2, Keep them as the apple of thine eye.'
   Such tender affections should we have to the testimonies of the Lord,
   as a man has for his eye. The least offence to the eye is troublesome;
   a man should be as chary of the commandment as he would be of his eye.
   Sometimes it implies the similitude of keeping a way: Josh. i. 7, Turn
   not to the right hand or to the left.' A traveller is very careful to
   keep his way; so when we are thus careful, tender, chary of God's
   commandments and testimonies, this is an argument of a blessed
   condition. Thus we are to keep it in the heart.

   [2.] We are to observe it in practice; Luke xi. 28, Yea, rather,
   blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it;' that is, not
   only that hear it, but do it. Many have this word in their mind and
   memory, but not in their lives. Without this, hearing is nothing;
   liking, knowing, assent, pretended affection is all in vain: 1 John ii.
   4, He that saith I know him, and keeps not his commandments, is a liar,
   and the truth is not in him.' Our actions are a better discovery of our
   thoughts than our words. When we get a little knowledge, and make a
   little profession, we think we observe his commands; but he is a liar
   if he be not exact, and walk close with God. It is not enough to
   understand the word, to be able to talk and dispute of the testimonies
   of God, but to keep them. It is not enough to assent to them that they
   are God's laws, but they must be obeyed. The laws of earthly princes
   are not obeyed as soon as believed to be the king's laws, but when we
   are punctual to observe them. This is to keep the commandment of God;
   it implies both exactness and perseverance: Rev. iii. 8, Thou hast kept
   my word;' that is, thou hast not apostatised as others have done; and
   Prov. vi. 20, Keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of
   thy mother,' that is perseverance. You see by the first note who are
   the blessed men; they which own God's testimony in his word, and
   accordingly look upon it as a great charge and trust Christ hath
   reposed in them and given to them that they should keep his law. Now,
   certainly these are blessed. Why?

   (1.) They are blessed or cursed whom Christ in the last day will
   pronounce blessed or cursed. Now, in the last day to some he will say,
   Come, ye blessed of my Father;' to others, Go, ye cursed;' and he hath
   told us beforehand, that it is he that keepeth his testimonies whom he
   will own in that day, Mat. vii. 20-22. Many will come and challenge
   acquaintance with Christ: Lord, we have prophesied in thy name,' &c.;
   Thou hast taught in our streets' (so it is in Luke); but Christ will
   disown them: I know you not; depart from me, ye workers of iniquity.'
   Many will pretend to be of Christ's side, take up the opinions of the
   country wherein they live, frequent ordinances, &c.; but because they
   kept not his testimonies, Christ will not own them. When men are to be
   posed, they count it a favour to know the questions aforehand. God hath
   told us what will be the great evidence according to which he will
   proceed in the day of judgment--Have you kept my testimonies He that
   keeps close to God's word will find acceptance.

   (2.) They are blessed for whom Christ mediateth. Now, Christ mediateth
   for those that keep his word: John xvii. 6, They have kept thy word.'
   It is a grief to your advocate when he cannot speak well of you in
   heaven. But as soon as he seeth any fruits of obedience, where they
   consult often with God's testimony, though they have many failings, yet
   are careful as much as in them lies, then he goes to the Father and
   acquainteth him with it.

   (3.) Those that are taken into sweet fellowship and communion with God
   certainly they are in a blessed condition. Those to whom God will be
   intimate, and manifest himself in a way of gracious communion, are
   blessed. Now thus he doth to those that keep his testimonies: If any
   man love me and keep my commandments, my Father will love him, and we
   will make our abode with him.' The whole Trinity will come and dwell in
   his heart.

   But now you must know, there is a twofold keeping of God's
   testimonies--legal and evangelical. Legal keeping is in a way of
   perfect and absolute obedience, without the least failing; so none of
   us can be blessed. Moses will accuse us; there will be failings in the
   best. But now evangelical keeping--that is, a filial and sincere
   obedience--is accepted, and the imperfections Christ pardoneth. If
   God's pardon help us not, we are for ever miserable. The apostles had
   many failings; sometimes they manifested a weak faith, sometimes
   hardness of heart, sometimes passionateness when they met with
   disrespect, Luke ix.; yet Christ returns this general acknowledgment of
   them when he was pleading with his Father, Holy Father, they have kept
   thy word.' When the heart is sincere, God will pass by our failings,
   James v. 11, Ye have heard of the patience of Job.' Ay! and of his
   impatience too, his cursing the day of his birth; but the Spirit of God
   puts a finger upon the scar, and takes notice of what is good. So long
   as we bewail sin, seek remission of sin, strive after perfection,
   endeavour to keep close and be tender of a command, though a naughty
   heart will carry us aside sometimes, we keep the testimony of the Lord
   in a gospel sense. Bewailing sin, that owns the law; seeking pardon,
   that owns the gospel; striving after perfection, that argueth sincerity
   and uprightness. Well, then, here is the discriminating note; if we
   would know whether we come within the compass of David's blessed man,
   if we have a dear and tender esteem of God's testimonies, when we would
   fain have them impressed upon our hearts, and expressed in our lives
   and conversations, They keep his testimonies.'

   The next now is:--

   2. They seek him with the whole heart.

   This is fitly subjoined to the former for a double reason; partly,
   because the end of God's testimonies is to direct us how to seek after
   God, to bring home the wandering creature to its centre and place of
   rest; partly, because whoever keeps the commandments of God, he will be
   forced to seek God for light and help.

   Obedience doth not only qualify us for communion with God, but (where
   it is regarded in good earnest) necessitates us to look after it; for
   we cannot come to God without God; and therefore, if we would keep his
   testimonies, we must be seeking of God. Well, then--

   Doct. 2. Those that would be blessed must make this their business,
   sincerely to seek after God.

   1. Observe the act of duty; they seek the Lord.

   2. The manner of performance, with the whole heart.

   First, What it is to seek the Lord.

   1. To seek the Lord presupposeth our want of God: for no man seeks what
   he hath, but for what he hath not. All that are seeking are sensible of
   their want of God. For instance, when we begin to seek him at first, it
   begins with a sound remorse and sense of our natural estrangement from
   him. The first work and great care of returning penitents is to inquire
   after God. So long as men lie unconverted, they are wholly neglectful
   of him, and think they do not want God: Ps. xiv. 2, There is none that
   understands and seeks after God.' They have no affection or desire of
   communion with God. They seek such things as their hearts lust after,
   but it is not their desire or care to enjoy God. But when the
   conversion of the Jews is spoken of, Hosea iii. 5, it is said, They
   shall return and seek the Lord their God.' At first conversion men are
   sensible of their great distance from God, and are troubled they have
   been so long strangers to him. Go to another sort of seekers, they are
   sensible of the same thing; in case of desertion it is clear: Cant. v.
   6, My beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone; I sought him, but I
   could not find him.' They never begin to recover until they are first
   sensible of their loss; when they see Christ is gone, they are left
   dead and comfortless; yea, all believers, their seeking or looking
   after communion with God is grounded upon a sense of want in some
   degree and measure; it is little they have in comparison of what they
   want and expect; and therefore still the children of God are a
   generation of seekers, that seek after God,' Ps. xxiv. 6; whatever they
   enjoy, they are still in pursuit of more. They are always breathing
   after God, and desire to enjoy more communion with him. A wicked man is
   always running from God, and is never better than when he is out of
   God's company, when he is rid of all thoughts of God. He runs from his
   own conscience, because he finds God there; he runs from the company of
   good men, because God is there--holy conference is as a prison; he runs
   from ordinances, because they bring God near to his conscience, and put
   him in mind of God: he avoids death, because he cannot endure to be
   with God. But men that have a sense and want of God upon them, will be
   inquiring and seeking after him.

   2. This seeking may be known by the things sought. What do we seek for?
   Union and communion with God: Ps. cv. 4, Seek the Lord and his
   strength; seek his face for evermore.' It is an allusion to the ark,
   which was a pledge of God's favourable and powerful presence; so that
   which we seek after is God's favourable and powerful presence, that we
   may find the Lord reconciled, comforting and quickening our heart.
   Communion with God is the main thing that we seek after, as to the
   enjoyment of his favour in the acceptance of our persons and pardon of
   our sins. This is that the man of God expresseth, in his own name and
   in the name of all the saints: Ps. iv. 6, 7, Lord, lift thou up the
   light of thy countenance upon us;' that God would display his beams of
   favour upon the soul. So Ps. lxiii. 3, Thy favour is better than life.'
   And then his strength too, that he may subdue our corruptions,
   temptations, enemies, Micah vii. 19; and that he may supply our wants
   inward and outward by his all-sufficiency, Phil. iv. 19. God telleth
   Abraham, I am God all-sufficient; walk before me, and be thou perfect.'

   3. The formality of the duty may be explained with respect to graces
   and ordinances. It consists in the exercise of grace, and in the use of
   ordinances.

   [1.] The exercise of grace--faith and love. (1.) Faith is often
   expressed by terms of motion--coming, running, going, seeking. Thus is
   the whole tendency of soul towards God expressed by terms that are
   proper to outward motion. Coming notes our serious resolution and
   purpose to make after God. Going notes the practice or progress in that
   resolution. Running notes the fervour and earnestness of the soul to
   enjoy God. And seeking, that notes our diligence in the use of means.
   That faith is implied in seeking appears by comparing these two
   scriptures: Isa. xi. 10, To it shall the Gentiles seek.' Now when this
   is spoken of in the New Testament, it is rendered thus, Rom. xv. 12, In
   him shall the Gentiles trust.' So that it notes confidence and hope.
   (2.) It notes love, which is exercised herein, which puts upon sallies
   and earnest egressions of soul after the party loved: Ps. lxiii. 8, My
   soul follows hard after thee.' It is grievous to those who love God to
   think of separation from him, or to forbear to seek after him. The
   great care of their souls is to find God, that he may direct, comfort,
   strengthen, and sanctify them, and to have sweet experience of his
   grace. Thus the spouse sought him whom her soul loved,' and gave not
   over till she found him.

   [2.] Again, it is exercised in the use of the ordinances, as the word
   and prayer. God will be sought in his own ordinances. Christ walks in
   the midst of the golden candlesticks. If you would find a man, mind
   where is his walk and usual resort. When Christ was lost, his parents
   sought him in the temple; there they found him. If you would find
   Christ, look to the shepherds' tents in the assemblies of his people,
   Cant i. 7, 8; there shall you meet him. Only let me tell you, in these
   ordinances it is not enough to make Christ the object of them, to
   worship Christ, but he must be made the end of them. To serve God is
   one thing, to seek him another. To serve God is to make him the object
   of worship, to seek God is to make him the end of worship, when we will
   not go away from him without him: Gen. xxxii. 16, I will not let thee
   go unless thou bless me.' It is not enough to make use of ordinances,
   but we must see if we can find God there. There are many that hover
   about the palace, that yet do not speak with the prince; so possibly we
   may hover about ordinances, and not meet with God there. To go away
   with the husk and shell of an ordinance, and neglect the kernel, to
   please ourselves because we have been in the courts of God, though we
   have not met with the living God, that is very sad. A traveller and
   merchant differ thus:--A traveller goes from place to place only that
   he may see; but a merchant goes from port to port that he may take in
   his lading, and grow rich by traffic. So a formal person goes from
   ordinance to ordinance, and is satisfied with the work; a godly man
   looks to take in his lading, that he may go away from God with God;
   that he may meet God here and there, in this duty and in that, and go
   away from God with God. A man that makes a visit only by constraint,
   and not by friendship, it is all one to him whether the person be at
   home or no; but another would be glad to find his friend there: so, if
   we from a principle of love come to God in these duties, our desires
   will be to find the living God.

   Again, if God be not found in an ordinance, yet we must continue
   seeking; you may find him in the next. Sometimes God will not be found
   in public, that he may be found in private ordinances. The spouse
   sought him upon her bed,' then in every street of the city: Isa. lv. 6,
   Seek the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is near.'
   In prayer we come most directly to enjoy God, and do more especially
   call him in to our help and relief; there all graces are acted. If you
   cannot find God in prayer, look for him in the supper, and in the word;
   if he be not comfortably present in the word, seek him by meditation:
   Cant. v. 6, My soul failed when he spake;' that is, when I considered
   his speaking, for his wooing was over, my be loved was gone; but when I
   thought of his speaking my soul failed David consults with Nathan, but
   he could give him no clear answer; what then? 2 Sam. vii. 4, The word
   of the Lord came that night unto Nathan, saying, Go and tell my servant
   David,' &c. So when we have been inquiring after God all day in public
   worship, all this while the oracle is silent; but at night, when going
   over these things again, God may be found. Acts xvii. 12, it is said,
   Therefore many of them believed.' How?--when they searched the word;
   though in the hearing they did not discern the impressions of God upon
   the word; but when they searched and studied, going over them in
   private duties, God appeared. Heb. xi. 11, it is said, She judged him
   faithful that had promised.' How so? at first hearing? No; Sarah
   laughed when God promised her a son (for it was the Son of God that was
   in company with the angels, Gen. xviii.); but afterwards, when she
   considered of it, she judged him faithful.

   Thus we must follow God from ordinance to ordinance. It argues a great
   deal of pride in carnal men, that if God doth not meet them presently
   they throw off all. Now and then they will see what they shall have for
   calling upon God; but if God do not answer at the first knock, they are
   gone.

SERMON III.

   Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, that seek him with the
   whole heart.--Ver. 2.

   Use 1. To press you to seek God. The motives are:

   1. It was the end of our creation. We do not live merely to live; but
   for this end were we sent into the world, to seek God. ^Nature is
   sensible of it in part by the dissatisfaction it finds in other things;
   and therefore the apostle describes the Gentiles to be groping and
   feeling about for God, Acts xvii. 27. God is the cause of all things,
   and nature cannot be satisfied without him. We were made for God, and
   can never enjoy satisfaction until we come to enjoy him; therefore the
   Psalmist saith, Ps. xiv. 2, We are all gone aside, and altogether
   become filthy.' Nature is out of joint; we are quite out of our way to
   true happiness. We are seeking that for which we were created, when we
   seek and inquire after God.

   2. We seek other things that we want with great solicitude and care; we
   are cumbered with much serving to obtain the world: and shall' any
   thing be sought more than God? We can least spare him. The chiefest
   good should be sought after with the chiefest care, and chiefest love,
   and chiefest delight; nothing should be so precious to us as God. It is
   the greatest baseness that can be, that anything should take up our
   time, our thoughts, and content us more than God. When we come to God
   we are earnest for other things: Hosea vii. 14, They howl upon their
   beds for corn and wine.' If anything be sought from God above God, more
   than God, and not for God, it is but a brutish cry.

   3. It is our benefit to seek God. It is no benefit to God if we do not
   seek him. The Lord [3] hath no less, though we have less. He that hides
   himself from the sun, doth not impair the light. We derogate nothing
   from God if we do not seek him. He needed not the creature: he had
   happiness enough in himself; but we hide ourselves from our own
   happiness and our own peace. But what benefit have we by seeking God? A
   great deal of present benefit: Ps. xxii. 26, They that seek thee shall
   praise thy name.' You will have cause to bless God before the search be
   over. God hath passed his word, there are a great many experiences we
   taste. As they that continue in the pursuit of the philosopher's stone
   find out many experiences which are a satisfaction to their
   understandings, so, one way or other, we shall have cause to bless God.
   The God of Jacob hath openly professed we shall not seek him in vain,
   Isa. xliv. 19 , that is, this is a truth God hath written as it were
   with a sunbeam, that something will come in seeking of God. By seeking
   him in prayer we carry away a great deal of comfort and strength. As we
   read of that emperor that sent not away any one sad out of his
   presence, so neither doth God; there is some comfort to be had in
   waiting upon him; and as it brings present comfort and satisfaction, so
   it brings an everlasting reward: Heb. xi. 6, He is a rewarder of them
   that diligently seek him.' If you would have the fruit of your holy
   calling, that which is the result of that religion you do profess, you
   must diligently seek him, so that in effect we never seek ourselves
   more than when we seek the Lord: Amos v. 6, Seek the Lord, and ye shall
   live.' It is the undoubted way to get eternal life, to live for ever.
   They that seek not his face here shall never see his face for ever.
   With what diligence will men court an outward preferment, which is yet
   very uncertain? Prov. xxix. 26, All men seek the ruler's face; but
   every man's judgment is of the Lord.' What a deal of observance and
   waiting is there for the ruler's face and favour! and yet God disposeth
   of every man's judgment. It is uncertain whether they shall obtain it^
   yea or nay; but now, if you seek the face of God in heaven, you shall
   live for ever.

   4. If you do not sensibly find God, yet comfort thyself that thou art
   in a seeking way, and in the pursuit of him: Ps. xxiv. 6, God's people
   are described to be the generation of them that seek him.' This is the
   true mark of God's chosen people; they make it their business to get
   the favour of God, and to wrestle through discouragements. It is better
   to be a seeker than a wanderer. Though we do not feel the love of God,
   nor have the comfort of a pardon, have no sensible communion with him;
   yet the choice and bent of the heart is towards him, and you have the
   character of God's people upon you.

   5. You have misspent a great deal of time already, and long neglected
   God; therefore, now you should seek him: Hosea x. 22. It is time to
   seek the Lord, until he come and rain righteousness upon you.' It is
   time, that is, it is not too late, while we are preserved and invited.
   And again, it is time, that is, it is high time; the business of your
   lives hath been too long neglected. It is such another expression as 1
   Peter iv. 3, The time past is enough to have wrought the will of the
   Gentiles,' &c. God hath been too long kept out of his right, and we out
   of our happiness. The night is coming upon us, and will you not begin
   your day's work?

   6. This is the reason of affliction: we are so backward in this work
   that we need to be whipped unto it: Hosea v. 15, I will go and return
   to my place, saith God, till they acknowledge their offence and seek my
   face.' God knows that want is a spur to a lazy creature; and therefore
   doth God break in upon men, and scourge them as with scorpions, that
   they may bethink themselves, and look after God.

   Use 2. For direction. If you would seek God--

   1. Seek him early: Prov. viii. 32, Blessed are they that seek me
   early.' We cannot soon enough go about this work. Seek him when God is
   nigh, when the Spirit is nigh: Isa. lv.6, Call upon the Lord while he
   is near.' There are certain seasons which you cannot easily get again;
   such times when God doth deal more pressingly with you, when the word
   bears in upon the heart, and when God is near unto us. David like a
   quick echo returns upon God: Ps. xxvii. 8, Seek ye my face; my heart
   said unto thee, Thy face, Lord, will I seek.' It would be a great loss
   not to obey present impulses and invitations, and not make use of the
   advantages which God puts into our hands.

   2. Seek him daily; Ps. cv. 4, Seek the Lord and his strength; seek his
   face evermore.' That is, from day to day you must be seeking the face
   of God, in the strength of God. Every hour we need his direction,
   protection, strength; and we are in danger to lose him, if we do not
   continue the search.

   3. Seek him unweariedly, and do not give over your seeking until you
   find God. Wrestle through discouragements; though former endeavours
   have been in vain, yet still we should continue seeking after God. We
   have that command to enforce us to it: Luke v. 5, We have toiled all
   night; howbeit at thy command,' &c. Though we do not presently find,
   yet we must not cast off all endeavours. In spiritual things many times
   a man hears and goes away with nothing but when he comes to meditate
   upon it, and work it upon the heart, then he finds the face of God, and
   the strength of God. Therefore, you must not give over your seeking.

   4. Seek him in Christ. God will only be found in a mediator: Heb. vii.
   25, Those are accepted that come to God by him.' Guilty creatures
   cannot enjoy God immediately; and in Christ, God is more familiar with
   us: Hosea iii. 5, They shall seek the Lord their God, and David their
   king.' None can seek him rightly but those that seek him in Christ. It
   is uncomfortable to think of God out of Christ. As the historian saith
   of Themistocles, when he sought the favour of the king, he snatched up
   the king's son, and so came and mediated for his grace and favour. Let
   us take the Son of God in the arms of our faith, and present him to God
   the Father, and seek his face, his strength.

   5. God can only be sought by the help of his own Spirit. As our access
   to God, we have it by Christ, so we have it by the Spirit: Eph. ii. 18,
   For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.' As
   Christ gives us the leave, so the Spirit gives us the help. Bernard
   speaks fitly to this purpose; None can be aforehand with God, we cannot
   seek him till we find him in some sense: he will be sought that he may
   be found; and he is found that he may be sought. It is his preventing
   grace which makes us restless in the use of means; and when we are
   brought home to God, when we seek after God, it is by his own grace.
   The spouse was listless and careless until she could take God by the
   scent of his own grace, when he put his finger upon the handle of the
   lock, and dropped myrrh.' By the sweet and powerful influences of his
   grace, she was carried on in seeking after God. Thus much for the first
   part of the duty, seek.

   Secondly, Now the manner, with the whole heart.

   Doct. Whoever would seek God aright, they must seek him with their
   whole heart.

   Here I shall inquire--

   1. What doth this imply?

   2. Why God will be sought with the whole heart?

   1. What doth this imply? It implies sincerity and integrity; for it is
   not to be taken in the legal sense, with respect to absolute
   perfection, but in opposition to deceit: Jer. iii. 10, Judah has not
   turned to me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the Lord.' It
   is spoken of the time of Josiah's reformation; many men whirled about
   with the times, and were forced by preternatural motions. The Father of
   spirits above all things requireth the spirit, and he that is the
   searcher and judge of the heart requireth the heart should be
   consecrated to him. Integrity opposeth partiality. There are indeed two
   things in this expression, the whole heart; it notes extension of parts
   and intension of degrees,

   [1.] The extension of parts; with the understanding, will, and
   affections. Some seek God with a piece of their hearts, to explain it
   either in the work of faith or love. In the work of faith; as Acts
   viii. 37, If thou believest with all thine heart.' There is a believing
   with a piece, and a believing with all the heart. There is an inactive
   knowledge, a naked assent, which may be real, yet it is not a true
   faith; the devil may have this: Luke iv. 34, the devil makes an
   orthodox confession there, Thou art Jesus, the Son of the living God.'
   This is only a conviction upon the understanding, without any bent upon
   the heart. It is not enough to own Christ to be the true Messiah, but
   we must embrace him, put our whole trust in him. There may be an assent
   joined with some sense and conscience, and some vanishing sweetness and
   taste by the reasonableness of salvation by Christ, Heb. vi. 4; but
   this is not believing with all the heart; it is but a taste, a lighter
   work upon the affections, and therefore bringeth in little experience.
   There may be some assent, such as may engage to profession and partial
   reformation, but the whole heart is not subdued to God. Then do we
   believe with the whole heart, when the heart is warmed with the things
   we know and assent to; when there is a full and free consent to take
   Christ upon God's terms, to all the uses and purposes for which God
   hath appointed him: 1 Chron. xxviii. 9, Know thou the God of thy
   father, and serve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind;'
   when there is an effective and an affective know ledge; when we can not
   only discourse of God and Christ, and are inclined to believe; but when
   these truths soak into the heart to frame it to the obedience of his
   will. When the Lord had spoken of practical obedience, Was not this to
   know me, saith the Lord?' Jer. xxii. 16. And this is to believe. So for
   love: Deut. vi. 5, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine
   heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.' Every faculty
   must express love to God. Many will be content to give God a part. God
   hath their consciences, but the world their affections. Their heart is
   divided, and the evidence of it is plainly this: In their troubles and
   extremities they will seek after God, but this is not their constant
   work and delight. We are welcome to God when we are compelled to come
   into his presence. God will not say, as men, You come in your
   necessity. But we must then be sincere in our addresses, and rest in
   him as our portion and all-sufficient good.

   [2.] For intension of degrees. To seek God with the whole heart, is to
   seek him with the highest elevation of our hearts. The whole heart must
   be carried out to God, and to other things for God's sake. As
   harbingers, when they go to take up room for a prince, they take up the
   whole house, none else must have place there; so God, he will have the
   whole heart.

   Again, it may be considered as to the exaction of the law, and as a
   rule of the gospel.

   (1.) As an exaction of the law; and so Christ urged it to the young man
   that was of a pharisaical institution, to abate his pride and
   confidence: Mat. xxii. 37, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all
   thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.' Certainly
   these words there have a legal importance and signification; for in an
   other Evangelist, Luke x. 28, it is added, Do and live,' which is the
   tenor of the law. And Christ's intent was to abate the Pharisees'
   pride, by propounding the rigour of the first covenant. The law
   requireth complete love without the least defect; according to the
   terms of it, a grain wanting would make the whole unacceptable; as a
   hard land lord, when all the rent is not brought to the full, he
   accepteth none. It is good to consider it under this sense, that we may
   seek God in Christ to quicken us, that we may value our deliverance by
   him from this burden, which neither we nor our fathers were able to
   bear; a straggling thought, a wandering glance, the least outrunning of
   the heart, had rendered us accursed for ever.

   (2.) It may be considered as a rule of the gospel, which requireth our
   utmost endeavours, our bewailing infirmities and defects, but accepts
   of sincerity. There will be a double principle in us to the last, but
   there should not be a double heart. So that this expression of seeking
   the Lord with the whole heart is reconcilable enough with the
   weaknesses of the present state. For instance: 1 Kings xiv. 8, My
   servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all
   his heart, and did that only which was Bright in mine eyes.' David had
   many failings, and some that left an indelible brand upon him, in the
   matter of Uriah, yet because of his sincerity, and habitual purpose,
   God saith, He hath kept all my commandments.' So in Josiah: 2 Kings
   xxiii. 25, Like to him there was no king before him, that turned to the
   Lord with all his heart, with all his soul, and with all his might.'
   Yet he also had his imperfections; against the warning of the Lord he
   goes out with a wicked king, and dies in battle. So Asa: 2 Chron. xv.
   17, The high places were not taken away--it was a failing in that holy
   king--yet it is said, The heart of Asa was perfect all his days.' Well,
   then, when the whole heart is engaged in this work, when we do not only
   study to know God, but make it our work to enjoy him, to rest in him as
   our all-sufficient portion, though there will be many defects, yet then
   are we said to seek him with the whole heart.

   2. The reasons why God will be sought with the whole heart are--

   [1.] He that gives but part to God doth indeed give nothing. The devil
   keeps an interest as long as one lust remains unmortified, and one
   corner of the soul is kept for him. As Pharaoh stood hucking,--he would
   fain have some pawn of their return; either leave your children behind;
   no, no, they must go and see the sacrifices, and be trained up in the
   way of the Lord; then he would have their flocks and herds left behind;
   he knew that would draw their hearts back again, so Satan must have
   either this lust or that; he knows by keeping part all will fall to his
   share in the end. A bird that is tied in a string seems to have more
   liberty than a bird in a cage; it flutters up and down, though it be
   held fast: so many seem to flutter up and down and do many things, as
   Herod; but his Herodias drew him back again into the fowler's net. Thus
   because of a sinner's danger.

   [2.] Because of God's right. By creation he made the whole, therefore^
   requires the whole;' the Father of spirits' must have the whole spirit.
   We were not mangled in our creation; God, that made the whole, must
   have the whole. He preserves the whole. Christ hath bought the whole: 1
   Cor. vi. 20, Glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are
   God's.' And God promiseth to glorify the whole. Christians, it would be
   uncomfortable to us if God should only take a part to heaven. All that
   you have is to be glorified in the day of Christ; all that you are and
   have must be given to him--whole spirit, soul, and body. Let us not
   deprive him of any part.

   Use. Well, do we serve God and seek after God with the whole heart? The
   natural mother had rather part with the whole than see the child
   divided, 1 Kings iii. 26. God had rather part with the whole than take
   a piece. Either he will have the whole of your love, or leave the whole
   to Satan. The Lord complains, Hosea x. 2, Their heart is divided.' Men
   have some affections for God many times, but they have affections for
   their lusts too, the world hath a great share and portion of their
   heart.

   Quest. But when, in a gospel sense, may we be said to seek God with the
   whole heart? Take it in these short propositions.

   1. When the settled purpose of our souls is to cleave to God, to love
   and serve him with an entire obedience, both in the inward and outward
   man, when this is the full determination and consent of our hearts.

   2. When we do what we can by all good means to maintain this purpose;
   for otherwise it is but a fruit of conviction, a freewill pang: Acts
   xxiv. 16, Herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void
   of offence towards God, and towards all men.'

   3. When we search out our defects, and are ever bewailing them with
   kindly remorse: Rom. vii. 24, O wretched man that I am! who shall
   deliver me from this body of death?'

   4. When we run by faith to Christ Jesus, and sue out our pardon and
   peace in Christ's name, until we come to be complete in him: Col. i.
   10, That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being
   fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God.'

SERMON IV.

   They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.--Ver. 3.

   STILL the Psalmist continues the description of a blessed man. In the
   two first verses, holiness (which is the way to and evidence of
   blessedness) is considered with respect to the subject and the object
   of it, the life and the heart of man. The life of man, Blessed are the
   undefiled in the way.' The heart of man, they seek him with the whole
   heart.'

   Now, holiness is considered, in the parts of it, negatively and
   positively. The two parts of holiness are an eschewing of sin and
   studying to please God. You have both in this verse, They also do no
   iniquity: they walk in His ways.'

   First, You have the blessed man described negatively, they do no
   iniquity. Upon hearing the words, presently there occurs a doubt, how
   then can any man be blessed? for there is not a man that liveth and
   sinneth not,' Eccles. vii. 20; and James iii. 2, In many things we
   offend all.' To deny it, is a flat lie against the truth, and against
   our own. experience. If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves,
   and the truth is not in us,' 1 John i. 8. The expression may be abused
   on the one side, to establish the impeccability and perfection of the
   saints. On the other side, it may be abused by persons of a weak and
   tender conscience, to the hindrance of their comfort and rejoicing in
   God. When they shall hear this is the character of a blessed man, they
   do no iniquity,' they are very apt to conclude against their own
   regeneration, because of their daily failings.

   To avoid these difficulties, I shall inquire--

   1. What it is to do iniquity.

   2. Who are the persons among the sons of men that may be said to do no
   iniquity.

   First What it is to do iniquity? If we make it our trade and practice'
   to continue in wilful disobedience. To sin is one thing, but to make
   sin our work is another: 1 John iii. 9, He that is born of God doth not
   commit sin;' he doth not work sin; and Mat. vii. 23, Depart from me, ye
   that work iniquity.' That is the character of the reprobate workers of
   iniquity. So John viii. 34, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of
   sin.' Sin is their constant trade: Ps. cxxxix. 24, See if there be any
   wicked way in me.' None are absolutely freed from sin, but it is not
   their trade, their way, their work. When a man makes it his study and
   business to carry on a course of sin, then he is said to do iniquity.

   Secondly, Who are those that are said to do no iniquity in God's
   account, though they fail often through weakness of the flesh and
   violence of temptation? Answer--

   1. All such as are renewed by grace, and reconciled to God by Christ
   Jesus; to these God imputeth no sin to condemnation, and in his account
   they do no iniquity. Notable is that, 1 Kings xiv. 8. It is said of
   David, He kept my commandments, and followed me with all his heart, and
   did that only which was right in mine eyes.' How can that be? We may
   trace David by his failings; they are upon record everywhere in the
   word; yet here a veil is drawn upon them; God laid them not to his
   charge. There is a double reason why their failings are not laid to
   their charge. Partly, because of their general state; they are in
   Christ, taken into favour through him; and there is no condemnation to
   them that are in Christ.' Rom. viii. 1; therefore particular errors and
   escapes do not alter their condition. Which is not to be understood as
   if a man should not be humbled, and ask God's pardon for his
   infirmities; no, for then they prove iniquities, they will lie upon
   record against us. It was a gross fancy of the Valentinians, that held
   they were not defiled with sin what soever they committed; though base
   and obscene persons, yet still they were as gold in the dirt. No, no;
   we' are to recover ourselves by repentance, to sue out the favour of
   God. When David humbled himself, and had repented, then saith Nathan, 2
   Sam. xii. 13, The Lord hath put away thy sin.' Partly, too, because
   their bent and habitual inclination is to do otherwise. They set
   themselves to comply with God's will, to seek and serve the Lord,
   though they are clogged with many infirmities. A wicked man sinneth
   with deliberation and delight; his bent is to do evil; he makes
   provision for lusts.' Rom. xiii. 12, and serves them by a voluntary
   subjection, Titus iii. 3. But those that are renewed by grace are not
   debtors to the flesh; they have taken another debt and obligation upon
   them, which is to serve the Lord, Rom. viii. 12. Partly, too, because
   their general course and way is to do otherwise. Unumquodque operatur
   secundum suam formam--everything works according to its form; the
   constant action a of nature are according to the kind. So the new
   creature, his constant operations are according to grace. A man is
   known by his custom, and the course of his endeavours, what is his
   business. If a man be constantly, easily, frequently carried away to
   sin, it discovers a habit of soul, and the temper of his heart. Meadows
   may be overflown, but marsh ground is drowned with the return of every
   tide. A child of God may be carried away, and act contrary to the bent
   and inclination of the new nature; but when men are drowned and
   overcome with the return of every temptation, and carried away, it
   argues a habit of sin. And partly, because sin never carries it away
   clearly, but with some dislikes and resistances of the new nature. The
   children of God make it their business to avoid all sin, by watching,
   praying, mortifying: Ps. xxxix. 1, I said, I will take heed to my ways,
   that I sin not with my tongue.' And then there is a resistance of the
   sin. God hath planted graces in their hearts; the fear of his majesty,
   that works a resistance; and therefore there is not a full allowance of
   what they do. This resistance sometimes is more strong; then the
   temptation is overcome: How can I do this wickedness, and sin against
   God?' Gen. xxxix. 9. Sometimes it is more weak, and then sin carries
   it, though against the will of a holy man: Rom. vii. 15, 18, The evil
   which I hate, that do I.' It is the evil which they hate; they protest
   against it; they are like men which are oppressed by the power of the
   enemy. And then there is a remorse after the sin: David's heart smote
   him.' It grieves and shames them that they do evil. There is tenderness
   goes with the new nature; Peter sinned foully, but he went out and wept
   bitterly.

   Well, then, the point is this:--

   Doct. 1. They that are and shall be blessed are such as make it their
   business to avoid all sin.

   I may illustrate it by these reasons:--

   1. Surely they shall be blessed, for they take care to remove the
   makebate, the wall of partition between God and them. It is sin which
   separates: Isa. lix. 2, But your iniquities have separated between you
   and your God.' This was that which cast angels out of heaven; when they
   had sinned, God could endure their company no longer. This cast Adam
   out of paradise. This is that which hinders men from communion with
   God.

   2. These are men fitting and preparing themselves for the enjoyment of
   their great hopes: Col. i. 12, Who hath made us meet to be partakers of
   the inheritance of the saints in light;' 1 John iii. 3, He that hath
   this hope purifieth himself, even as he is pure.' Esther, when she was
   chosen to be bride and spouse to that great king, had her months of
   purification. The time we spend in the world are the months of our
   purification; it is a sign they mind their business, they are fitting
   for eternal happiness. They remember they are shortly to appear before
   the great God, therefore they would not be uncomely. Joseph washed his
   garments when he was to go before Pharaoh. They have these hopes that
   they shall see God as he is, that they shall be like him, and he will
   appear for their comfort; therefore they are fitting themselves more
   and more.

   3. In them true happiness is begun. There are degrees in blessedness
   the angels they never sinned; the glorified saints they have sinned,
   but sin no more; the saints upon earth, in them sin reigns not;
   therefore here is their happiness begun. As sin is taken away, so our
   happiness increaseth; first God begins with us in a way of
   justification, ne damnet; he takes away the damning power that is in
   sin; and in sanctification the work goes on, ne regnet, that sin may
   not reign afterward ne sit, that sin may not be; therefore these have
   begun their happiness, they are hastening towards it apace.

   Use 1. For trial and examination, whether we may be reckoned among the
   blessed men, yea or nay. There are some think, because the children of
   God are liable to so many failings, and there being so many wiles and
   circuits in the heart of man, that there can be no judgment made upon
   the case between the sins of the regenerate and unregenerate. But
   surely there is a difference between the sinning of the one, and the
   sinning of the other, and such a difference as may be discerned: 1 John
   iii. 9, Whosoever is born of God doth net commit sin.' Now mark, ver.
   10, In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the
   devil.' This is that which distinguisheth the children of God from the
   children of the devil. Well, then, how shall we manage this discovery,
   that we may be able to judge of our own estates?

   First, Let us consider how far sin may be in a blessed man, in a child
   of God.

   1. They have a corrupt nature, they have sin in them as well as others;
   it is their misery to the last: Rom. vii. 24, O wretched man that I
   am,' saith the holy apostle. Sin, though it be dejectum, cast down in
   regard of regency, yet it is not ejectum, cast out in regard of
   inherency; their corrupt nature sticks by them to the last. One
   compares it to a wild fig-tree, or to ivy in a wall; cut off the body,
   the boughs, sprigs, branches, yet still there will be something that
   will be sprouting up again until the wall be digged down. Such an
   indwelling sin is in us, though we pray, strive, and cut off the
   excrescences, the buddings out of it here and there, yet till it be
   plucked asunder by death, it continueth with us.

   2. They have their daily failings and infirmities: Eccles. vii. 20,
   There is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.'
   Those that for their general state are just and righteous men, yet
   certain sins they cannot get rid of, and are unavoidable; as sins of
   ignorance, incogitancy, sudden surreption, indeliberate incursions,
   which we shall never be freed from as long as we are in this imperfect
   state. So also imperfections of duty, for we cannot serve God with that
   high degree of reverence, delight, and perfection which he requireth
   There are unavoidable infirmities which are pardoned of course.

   3. They may be guilty of some sins which by watchfulness might be
   prevented, as vain thoughts, idle, passionate speeches, and many carnal
   actions. It is possible that these may be prevented by the ordinary
   assistances of grace, and if we will keep a strict guard over our own
   hearts. But in this case God's children may be overtaken and overborne;
   overtaken by the suddenness, or overborne by the violence of
   temptation: overtaken, Gal. vi. 1, If a man be overtaken in a fault,
   restore such an one,' &c.; and overborne, James i. 14, Every man is
   tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.'

   4. They may now and then fall foully; as Noah by excess of drink, Lot's
   incest, David's adultery, Peter's denial. Failings and infirmities they
   are not determined either by the smallness or by the greatness of the
   act, but by other concomitant circumstances. Not by the smallness of
   the act. There is as much treason in coining pence as shillings and
   pounds. Allowed affection to small sins is deadly and damnable: he that
   is unfaithful in little will be unfaithful in much. Christians, where
   temptations are weak and impotent, and of slight concernment and
   importance, they may be sooner confuted, and obedience is the more
   easy; so that our rebellion to God by small sins may be greater. A man
   may have great affections to small sins; so it may prove an iniquity, a
   damnable sin.

   On the other side, great sins may be infirmities; as Lot's incest,
   David's adultery, when they are not done with full consent of soul,
   when their hearts are not wholly carried away with them. Iniquities are
   determined by their manner: Jude 15, Their ungodly deeds which they
   have ungodly committed:' when with full consent of will, and it is
   their course that argues an habitual hatred and contempt of God.

   5. A child of God may have some particular evils, which may be called
   predominant sins (not with respect to grace, that is impossible, that a
   man should be renewed and have such sins that sin should carry the
   mastery over grace); but they may be said to have a predominancy in
   comparison of other sins; he may have some particular inclination to
   some evil above others. David had his iniquity, Ps. xviii. 23. Look, as
   the saints have particular graces; Abraham was eminent for faith,
   Timothy for sobriety, Moses for meekness, &c.; so they have their
   particular corruptions which are more suitable to their temper and
   course of life. Peter seems to be inclined to tergiversation, and to
   shrinking in a time of trouble. We find him often tripping in that
   kind; in the denial of his master; again, Gal. ii. 12, it is said he
   dissembled and complied with the Jews, therefore Paul withstood him to
   his face, for he was to be blamed.' It is evident by experience there
   are particular corruptions to which the children of God are more
   inclinable: this appears by the great power and sway they bear in
   commanding other evils to be committed, by their falling into them out
   of inward propensity when outward temptations are few or weak, or none
   at all; and when resistance is made, yet they are more pestered and
   haunted with them than with other temptations, which is a constant
   matter of exercise and humiliation to them.

   Secondly, Wherein doth grace now discover itself, where is the
   difference?

   1. In that they cannot fall into those iniquities wherein there is an
   absolute contrariety to grace, as hatred of God, total apostasy, so
   they cannot sin the sin unto death, 1 John v. 16.

   2. In that they do not sin with the whole heart: Ps. cxix. 176, I have
   gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant, for I do not forget
   thy commandments.' There was somewhat of God in the heart, when he was
   conscious to himself of strayings and wanderings; and David saith
   elsewhere, I have not departed wickedly from thy precepts.' When they
   sin, it is with the dislike and reluctancy of the new nature; it is
   rather a rape than a consent. Bernard saith, A child of God suffers sin
   rather than acts it, and his heart's protest is against it

   3. It is not their course; not constant, easy, and frequent. Relapses
   into gross sins, they argue an habitual aversion from God, for a habit
   is determined by the constancy and uniformity of acts; therefore it is
   but now and then under some great temptation. There is sin, and there
   is a way of sin: Ps. cxxxix. 24, Search me and see if there be any way
   of wickedness in me,' as Chrysostom glosseth.

   4. When they fall they do not rest in sin: Shall they fall, and shall
   they not arise?' Jer. viii. 4. They may fall into the dirt, but they do
   not lie and wallow there like swine in the mire. A fountain may be
   mudded, but it works itself clean again. The needle that hath been
   touched with the loadstone may be jogged and discomposed, but it never
   leaves till it turns towards the pole again. God's children have their
   failings, but they sue out their pardon, run to their advocate, 1 John
   ii. 1, humble themselves before God.

   5. Their falls are sanctified. When they have smarted under sin, they
   grow more watchful and more circumspect. A child of God may have the
   worse in proelio, in the battle, but not in bello, in the war. Some
   times the carnal part may get the victory, and they may fall foul, but
   see the issue: Ps. li. 6, In the hidden part thou shalt make me to know
   wisdom.' David had sinned against the Lord, but I have learned wisdom,
   never to trust a naughty heart more, but to look to myself better.

   6. Grace discovers itself by the constant endeavours which they make
   against sin. What is the constant course a Christian takes? They groan
   under the relics of sin; it is their burden that they have such an evil
   nature, Rom. vii. 24. They fly to God's grace in Christ for daily
   pardon, 1 John i. 9. They are ever washing their garments in the Lamb's
   blood, Rev. vii., and every day are cleansing themselves from the
   filthiness and defilement they contract by sin: John xiii. 10, He that
   is washed, needeth not save to wash his feet.' An allusion to a man
   that hath been a journey, in those countries where they went barefoot,
   when he came home he must wash his feet. So a man that is reconciled to
   God, though he hath been in the bath, in the fountain which God hath
   opened for uncleanness, yet every day he must be washing his feet,
   cleansing himself by the blood of Christ more and more, because he
   contracts new defilement. Then by using all endeavours against it, Col.
   iii. 5; as prayer, striving, watching, cutting off the provisions of
   the flesh, improving the death of Christ. They do not voluntarily and
   without opposition live under sin, and the slavish tyranny of it. Their
   bent and habitual inclination is to do otherwise; therefore they are
   said to do no iniquity: whereas those that are reckless and careless of
   their souls, sin, and never lay it to heart; they are the workers of
   iniquity.

   Use 2. If this be the character of a blessed man, to make it our
   business to avoid sin, then here is caution to God's people:

   1. To beware of all sin.

   2. To be very cautious against gross sins, committed against the light
   of conscience.

   3. To beware of continuance in sin.

   First, To beware of all sin. The more you have the mark of a blessed
   man: 1 John ii. 1, These things I write unto you, that you sin not.'
   Though you have a pardon and cleansing by the blood of Christ, though
   you have an advocate, yet sin not. Now the motives to set on this
   caution are taken from God, from ourselves, from the nature of sin.

   1. From God. Sin not. Why? Because it is an offence to God. Consider
   how contrary sin is to all the persons in the Trinity. To God the
   Father as a lawgiver, being a contempt of his authority, 1 John iii. 4.
   Sin is anomian, a transgression of the law,' that is, an act of
   disloyalty and rebellion against the crown of heaven. Open sin doth as
   it were proclaim rebellion and war against God; and privy sin is
   conspiracy against him. All creatures have a law: Ps. cxlviii. 6, Thou
   hast set to them a decree, beyond which they cannot pass.' And they are
   less exorbitant in their motions than we are. It is a greater violation
   to the law of nature for man to sin, than for the sea to break its
   bounds. The creatures have not sense and reason, yet they do not pass
   beyond the law which God hath set them. This should prevail with the
   new creature especially, whose hearts God hath suited to the law, so
   that they offer a violence to their own conscience. Take heed of
   entering into the lists with God, of despising his authority. Every sin
   that is committed slights the law which forbids it: 2 Sam. xii. 9,
   Wherefore despisest thou his commandments?' God stands much upon his
   law,--one tittle shall not pass away,--and you despise it, go about to
   make it void, when you give way to sin. Nay, it is an abuse of his
   love: 1 John iii. 1, Behold what manner of love the Father hath showed
   us;' you are children and sons of God, and will you slight his love?
   Your sins are like Absalom's treason against his father. The Rechabites
   are commended for keeping their father's command, Jer. xxxv. Set pots
   before them, &c.--No, our father hath forbidden us to drink wine. Their
   father was dead, but ours is living; will you that are sons renounce
   God, and side with the devil's party, and commit sin,--you to whom the
   Father hath showed such love that you should be called his children?
   Then it is a wrong to Jesus Christ--to his merit, to his example. To
   his merit. Christ came to take away sin, and will you bind those cords
   the faster which Christ came to loosen? Then you go about to defeat the
   purpose of his death, and put your Redeemer to shame. You seek to make
   void the great end for which Christ came, which was to dissolve sin.
   And, besides, you disparage the worth of the price he paid down; you
   make the blood of Christ a cheap thing, when you despise grace and
   holiness; you make nothing of that which cost him so dear--you lessen
   the greatness of his sufferings. And it is a wrong to his pattern. You
   should be pure as Christ is pure,' 1 John iii. 3; and ver. 7, be
   righteous as he is righteous.' You should discover what a holy person
   Christ was, by a conformity to him in your conversation. Now, will you
   dishonour him? What a strange Christ will you hold forth to the world,
   when his name is upon you--will you give way to sin and folly? And it
   is a wrong to God the Spirit, a grief to him. His great and first work
   was to wash us from sin, Titus iii. 5. You forget that such a work was
   past upon your hearts, and that you have been purged from your old
   sins,' when you return to them again, 2 Peter i. 9; and his constant
   residence in the heart is to check the lusts of the flesh, to prevent
   the actings of sin. If ye through the Spirit mortify the deeds of the
   body, ye shall live.' Rom. viii. 13; therefore you go about to make
   void his personal operation. Thus it is a wrong to God.

   2. By an argument drawn from ourselves; it is very unsuitable to you.
   We profess ourselves to be regenerate' and born of God: 1 John iii. 9,
   He that is born of God cannot sin.' It is not only contrary to thy
   duty, but to thy nature, as thou art a new creature. It were monstrous
   for the egg of one creature to bring forth a brood of another kind, for
   a crow or a kite to come from the egg of a hen. It is as unnatural a
   production for a new creature to sin; therefore you that are born of
   God, it is very uncomely and unsuitable. Do not dishonour your high
   birth.

   3. Consider the nature of sin; if you give way to it, it will encroach
   further. Sins steal into the throne insensibly; and being habituated in
   us by long custom, we cannot easily shake off the yoke or redeem
   ourselves from their tyranny. They go on from little to little, and get
   strength by multiplied acts. Therefore we should be very careful to
   avoid all sin.

   The second part of the caution is, beware of gross sins, committed
   against light and conscience. When we are tempted to sin, say with
   Joseph: Gen. xxxix. 9, How can I do this wickedness, and sin against
   God?' The more of deliberation and will there is in any action, the sin
   is the fouler. Consider, foul sins are a blot that will stick long by
   us. See 1 Kings xv. 5; it is said, David walked in all the ways of the
   Lord, and turned not aside from anything that he commanded him all the
   days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.' Why,
   there were many other things wherein David failed; you read of his
   diffidence and distrust in God: I shall one day perish by the hand of
   Saul.' We read of his dissimulation, and feigning himself mad in the
   company of the Philistines. We read of his injustice to Mephibosheth,
   his fond affection to Absalom, his indulgence to Amnon. We read of his
   numbering the people, which cost the lives of thousands all on a
   sudden: all these are great failings, but these are not taken notice
   of; but the matter of Uriah left a scar and blot that was not easily
   washed off.

   Thirdly, Beware of continuance in sin. How may we continue in sin? In
   what sense? Three things I shall take notice of in sin--culpa, reatus,
   macula; there is the fault, the guilt, the blot; and then we continue
   in sin, when the fault, the guilt, or blot is continued upon us.

   1. The fault is continued when the acts of it are repeated, when we
   fall into the same sin again and again. Relapses are very dangerous, as
   a bone often broken in the same place; you are in danger of this,
   before the breach be well made up between God and you; as Lot doubling
   his incest: to venture once and again is very dangerous.

   2. The guilt doth continue upon a man till serious and solemn
   repentance, till he sue out pardon in the name of Christ. Though a man
   should forbear the act, never commit it more; yet unless he retracts it
   by a serious remorse, and humbleth himself before God, and sueth out
   his pardon in a repenting way, the guilt continues. If we confess'--he
   speaks to believers--then sin is forgiven, not otherwise.

   3. There is the macula, the blot, by which the schoolmen understand an
   inclination to sin again; the evil influence of the sin continueth
   until we use serious endeavours to mortify the root of it. When we have
   been foiled by any lust, that lust must be more mortified. For
   instance, Jonah, he repented for forsaking his call, when he was cast
   into the whale's belly; but the sin broke out again, because he did not
   mortify the root; what was that?--his pride. So that it is not enough
   to bewail the sin, but we must lance the sore, and discover the root
   and core of it before all will be well. A man may repent of the
   eruption of sin, the former act, but the inclination to sin again is
   not taken off. Judges xvi. 2. Sampson loves a woman of Gaza, and she
   had betrayed him; but by carrying away the gates of the city he saves
   his life: possibly upon that experience he might repent of his folly
   and inordinate love to that woman. Ay! but the root remains: therefore
   he falls in love with another woman, with Delilah. Therefore if you
   would do what is your duty, you must look to the fault, that that be
   not renewed; the guilt, that that be not continued by omission of
   repentance; and that the blot also do not remain upon you, by not
   searching to the root of the distemper, the cause of that sin by which
   we have been foiled. So much for the first part of the text, They do no
   iniquity.

   The second note is, they walk in his ways. This is the positive part;
   not only avoiding of sin, but practice of holiness, is implied.
   Observe--

   Doct. 2. It is not enough only to avoid evil, but we must do good.

   They do no iniquity;' then they walk in his ways.' Why?

   1. The law of God is positive as well as negative. In every command
   there are precepts and prohibitions, that we might own God, as well as
   renounce the devil; and maintain communion with him, as well as avoid
   our own misery: Amos v. 15, Hate the evil, and love the good;' Rom.
   xii. 9, Abhor that which is evil, cleave to that which is good.'

   2. The mercies of God they are positive as well as privative. Our
   obedience should correspond with God's mercies. Now, God doth not only
   deliver us from hell, but he hath called us to glory. John iii. 16, The
   end of Christ's coming is, that we should not perish' (there is the
   privative part), but come to everlasting life' (there is the positive).
   In the covenant God hath undertaken to be a sun and a shield,' Ps.
   lxxxiv. 11; not only a sun, which is the fountain of life and
   vegetation and blessing, but a shield to defend us from danger in the
   world; therefore our obedience should be positive as well as privative.

   Use. It reproves those that rest in negatives. As it was said of the
   emperor, he was rather not vicious than virtuous. Many men, all their
   religion runs upon nots: Luke xviii. 11, I am not as this publican.'
   That ground is naught, though it brings not forth briars and thorns, if
   it yields not good increase. Not only the unruly servant is cast into
   hell, that beat his fellow-servant, that ate and drank with the
   drunken, but the idle servant, that wrapped up his talent in a napkin.
   Meroz is cursed, not for opposing and fighting, but for not helping,
   Judges v. 23. Dives did not take away food from Lazarus, but he did not
   give him of his crumbs. Many will say, I set up no other gods; ay! but
   dost thou love, reverence, and obey the true God? In the second
   commandment, I abhor idols; but dost thou delight in ordinances? I do
   not swear and rend the name of God by cursed oaths; ay! but dost thou
   glorify God and honour him? I do not profane the Sabbath; but dost thou
   sanctify it? Thou dost not plough and dance; but thou art idle, toyest
   away the Sabbath. Thou dost not wrong thy parents; but dost thou
   reverence them? Thou dost not murder; but dost thou do good to thy
   neighbour? Thou art no adulterer; but dost thou study temperance and a
   holy sobriety in all things? Thou art no slanderer; but art thou tender
   of thy neighbour's honour and credit as of thy own? Usually men cut off
   half their bill, as the unjust steward, when he owed a hundred, bade
   him set down fifty. We do not think of sins of omission. If we are not
   drunkards, adulterers, and profane persons, we do not think what it is
   to omit respects to God, and want of reverence to his holy majesty; to
   delight in him and his ways.

   In the next place, take notice of the notion, by which the precepts of
   God are expressed; here they are called ways, that walk in his ways;'
   how is that?--not as he hath given us an example, to be holy as he is
   holy, just as he is just; but his ways are his precepts. Why are they
   his ways? Because they are appointed by God, and prescribed by him.
   Which shows the evil of defection and going astray from him. It is a
   despising God's wisdom and authority. The great and wise God hath found
   out a way for the creature to walk in, that he may attain true
   happiness; and we must still be running out into bypaths; yea, it is a
   despising of his goodness: He hath showed thee, O man, what is good;'
   how to walk step by step. Then they are God's ways, as they lead to the
   enjoyment of him. From thence we may learn that many that wish to be
   where he is, shall never come there, because they do not walk in the
   way that leads to him. A man can never come to a place, that will not
   go in the way that will bring him thither: so they will never come to
   the enjoyment of God in a blessed estate, that will not take the Lord's
   way to blessedness, that follow not the course God hath prescribed to
   them in his word.

SERMON V.

   Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.--Ver. 4.

   THE Psalmist having laid down the description of the blessed man by the
   frame of his heart, and the course of his life, and the integrity of
   his obedience, he comes now to another argument whereby to enforce the
   entire observation of God's law. The argument in the text is taken from
   God's authority enjoining this course, and he propounds it by way of
   address and appeal to God for the greater emphasis and force, Thou hast
   commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.'

   In the words take notice of two things--

   1. The fundamental ground and reason of our obedience, which is God's
   command or will declared in his word.

   2. The manner of this obedience. God will not be put off with any
   thing, but served with the greatest diligence and exactness, to keep
   thy precepts diligently.' The Septuagint renders it, That thy commands
   should be kept exceeding much.'

   In the first part take notice--

   1. Of the lawgiver, thou.

   2. His authority interposed, or positive injunction, hast commanded us.
   It is not left to our arbitrament whether we will take up the course
   which leads to true happiness, yea or nay.

   3. The thing commanded, to keep thy precepts.

   Doct. To gain the heart to a full obedience, it is good to consider the
   authority of God in his word.

   There are many courses we must use to draw the heart to an obedience of
   God. We may urge--

   1. The reasonableness of obedience; so that if we are left at our
   liberty, we should take up the ways of God rather than any other: Rom.
   vii. 12, The commandment is holy, just, and good.' All that God hath
   required, it carrieth a great suitableness to the reasonable nature, so
   that if a man were well in his wits, and were to choose a law, he would
   of his own accord prefer the laws of God before liberty and any other
   service. Certainly there is an excellency in them which is in part
   discerned by carnal men; they admire those that practise the duties
   which God hath required, though they are loth to submit to them
   themselves. It is no heavy burden to live chastely, humbly, soberly,
   and to maintain a communion and correspondence with God; and whosoever
   doth so hath much the sweeter life of him that liveth sinfully. We may
   urge--

   2. The profitableness of obedience, and how much it conduceth to our
   good: Deut. x. 13, The statutes which I command thee for thy good.' Our
   labour in the work of obedience is not lost or misspent. A godly course
   is refreshed with many sweet experiences for the present, and will
   bring in a full reward for the future.

   3. The next motive is that of the text, to urge the command of God. It
   is a course enjoined and imposed upon us by our sovereign law giver. It
   is not in our choice, as if it were an indifferent thing whether we
   will walk in the laws of God or not, but of absolute necessity, unless
   we renounce the authority of God. This is the argument in the text,
   therefore let us see how it is laid down here.

   [1.] Take notice of the lawgiver, thou. It is not our equal, or one
   that will be baffled, but the great God, upon whom thou dependest every
   moment. Men are easily carried away to please those that have power
   over them, even sometimes to the wrong of God and conscience: Hosea v.
   11, Ephraim walked willingly after the commandment;' meaning Jeroboam's
   law for the worshipping the calves in Dan and Bethel. When we depend
   upon men we consent to their commands, and study a compliance, though
   contrary to our own inclinations. And is not God's authority to be
   regarded? Surely he hath the greatest right to command us, for he made
   us--there is none hath such dominion and lordship over us as God hath;
   and our dependence upon him is more than can be upon any created being,
   for in him we live, and move, and have our being;' and therefore, thou
   hast commanded, this should be a powerful argument. And mark, none can
   enforce his command with such threatenings and rewards as he can. Not
   with such threats: Mat. x. 28, Fear not him that can kill the body, and
   after that hath no more,' &c. Men can threaten us with strapados,
   dungeons, halters, and other instruments of persecution; but God, with
   a pit without a bottom, with a worm that never dies, with a fire that
   shall never be quenched, with torments without end, and without ease.
   Then for rewards. As Saul said, Can the son of Jesse give you
   vineyards, and make you captains of fifties, of hundreds, and of
   thousands?' The world takes him to have most right to command that can
   bid most for our obedience. Who can promise more than God, who is a
   plentiful rewarder of them that diligently seek him'? Heb. xi. 6. Who
   hath told us of a kingdom prepared for us; of a body glorious like unto
   Christ's body; of a soul enlarged to the greatest capacities of a
   creature; and yet filled up with God, and satisfied with the fruition
   of himself. This is the person spoken of in the text, to whom the
   Psalmist saith, Thou hast commanded us.' And surely if we would
   willingly walk after any commandment, we should after the commandment
   of the great God.

   [2.] The second circumstance is, hast commanded; he hath interposed his
   authority. Besides the particular precept and rule of duty, there are
   general commands or significations of God's authority to bind all the
   rest, Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts.' If the word of God,
   or rule of obedience, were. only given us as a direction, we should
   regard it as coming from the wisdom of God. But now it is an injunction
   as coming from the authority of God; therefore in his name we may
   charge you, as you will answer it another day, that these precepts be
   dear and precious to you. Unless you mean to renounce the sovereign
   majesty of God, and put him besides the throne, and break out into open
   rebellion against him, you must do what he hath commanded: 1 Tim. i. 9,
   Charge them that be rich in the world,' &c., not only advise but charge
   them. And Titus ii. 15, These things exhort, and rebuke with all
   authority.' God will have the creatures know that he expects this duty
   and homage from them.

   [3.] Here is the nature of this obedience, or the thing commanded, to
   keep thy precepts. What is that?--to observe the whole rule of faith
   and manners. Believing in Christ, that falls under a command: 1 John
   iii. 23, This is his command, that we should believe in him whom he
   hath sent.' Repentance is under a command: Acts xvii. 30, He hath
   commanded all men everywhere to repent.' Upon your peril be it, if you
   refuse his grace. So gospel obedience falls under a command, the great
   God hath charged us to keep all his precepts; to make conscience of all
   duties that we owe to God and man, Acts xxiv. 6; the smaller as well as
   the greater, Mat. v. 19. God counts his authority to be despised and
   laid aside, and the command and obligatory power of his law to be made
   void, if a man shall either in doctrine or practice count any
   transgression of his laws so light and venial as not to be stood upon,
   as if it were but a trifle. Christians, if we had the awe of God's
   authority upon our hearts, what kind of persons would we be at all
   times, in all places, and in all company? what a check would this be to
   a proud thought, a light word, or a passionate speech?--what exactness
   would we study in our conversations, had we but serious thoughts of the
   sovereign majesty of God, and of his authority forbidding these things
   in the word!

   To offer some reasons of the point, why it is of so much profit to
   consider the authority of God in the command.

   1. Because then the heart would not be so loose, off and on in point of
   duty; when a thing is counted arbitrary (as generally we count so of
   strictness), the heart hangs off more from God. When we press men to
   pray in secret, to be full of good works, to meditate of God, to
   examine conscience, to redeem time, to be watchful, they think these be
   counsels of perfection, not rules of duty, enforced by the positive
   command of God; therefore are men so slight and careless in them. But
   now, when a man hath learned to urge a naughty heart with the authority
   of God, and charge them in the name of God, he lies more under the awe
   of duty. Hath God said I must search and try my ways, and shall I live
   in a constant neglect of it? Hath God bidden me to redeem my time, and
   shall I make no conscience how I waste away my precious hours? Hath God
   bidden me keep my heart with all keepings, and shall I let it run at
   large without any restraint and regard? It is my debt, and I must pay
   it, or I shall answer it at my peril in the great day of accounts; it
   is not only commended but commanded: 2 Kings v. 13, If the prophet had
   bidden thee do some great thing, wouldst thou not have done it? how
   much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?'

   2. We cannot be so bold and venturous in sinning, when we remember how
   the authority of God stands in the way: Prov. xiii. 13, He that fears
   the commandment, he shall be blessed;' not only the penalty, but the
   command. The heart is never right until we be brought to fear a
   commandment more than any inconveniencies whatsoever. To a wicked man
   there seems to be nothing so light as a command, and therefore he
   breaks through against checks of conscience. But a man that hath the
   awe of God upon him, when mindful of God's authority, he fears a
   command. Jude 9, it is said of Michael the archangel, He durst not
   bring a railing accusation.' He had not the boldness, when the
   commandment of God was in his way.

   3. Many times we are doubtful of success, and so our hands are weakened
   thereby. We forbear duty, because we do not know what will come of it.
   Now, a sense of God's authority and command doth fortify the heart
   against these discouragements: Luke v. 5, Master, we have toiled all
   the night, howbeit at thy command we will cast down the net.' A poor
   soul that hath long lain at the pool, that hath been labouring,
   following God from one duty to another, and nothing comes sensibly of
   it, yet at thy command,' &c., he will keep up his endeavours still.
   This is the very case in the text, Blessed is the man that keeps thy
   precepts, and that seeks him with the whole heart.' Then, presently,
   Thou hast commanded;' that is, though our obedience had no promise of
   reward, and our felicity were not proposed as the fruit of it, yet the
   command itself, and the authority of God, is a reason sufficient.

   4. In some duties that are not evident by natural light, as believing
   and owning of Christ, the heart is more bound to them by the sense of a
   command, than by any other encouragement. It is God's pleasure it
   should be so: John vi. 29, This is the work of God, that ye believe on
   him whom he hath sent;' 1 John iii. 23, This is his commandment, that
   we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ.' It is enough to
   set a servant about his work, that it is his master's pleasure. Thou
   dost not stand disputing whether thou shouldst repent or not, obey or
   not, abstain from fleshly idols, yea or nay, or from fornication. And
   why should you stand aloof from the work of faith, and doubt whether
   you should believe or not? We have many natural prejudices, but this,
   his command, is a mighty relief to the soul. It is his command we
   should believe in his Son. It is not only a matter of comfort and
   privilege, but also a matter of duty and obedience; and therefore,
   though we have discouragements upon us--I am unworthy to be received to
   mercy--yet this will bend the heart to the work. God is worthy to be
   obeyed; it is his commandment. Thou dost not question whether thou
   shouldst grieve for thy sins--why should you question whether you
   should believe in Christ? If God had only given us leave to believe, we
   could not have had such an advantage, as now he hath interposed his
   authority, and commanded us to believe: Rejoice in the Lord; and again
   I say, Rejoice,' Phil. iv. If God had only given us leave to refresh
   ourselves in a sense of his love, it were an invaluable mercy; but we
   have not only leave to rejoice, but a charge. It is our duty to work up
   our heart to a comfortable sense of the love of God, and a fruition of
   his favour.

   5. Obedience is never right but when it is done out of a conscience of
   God's authority, intuitu voluntatis. The bare sight of God's will
   should be reason enough to a gracious heart. It is the will of God; it
   is his command, So it is often urged: 1 Thes. iv. 3, the apostle bids
   them follow holiness, for this is the will of God, your
   sanctification.' And servants should be faithful in their burdensome
   and hard labours: 1 Peter ii. 15, For so is the will of God, that with
   well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men.' And 1
   Thes. v. 18, In everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in
   Christ^ Jesus concerning you.' That is argument enough to a godly
   Christian, that God hath signified his will and good pleasure, though
   the duty were never so cross to his own desires and interests. They
   obey simply for the commandment sake, without any other reason and
   inducement. There is indeed ratio formalis, and ratio motiva. There are
   encouragements to God's service, but the formal reason of obedience is
   God's will. And this is pure obedience, to do what he wills, because he
   wills it.

   The uses are:--1. To exhort thee to take this course with thy naughty
   heart. When it hangs back from any duty, or from any course of
   strictness, urge it with the authority of God. These precepts are not
   the advices and counsels of men who wish well to us, and who would
   advise us to the best, but they are the commands of God, who must and
   will be obeyed. Or, when thou art carried out to any sin, it is
   forbidden fruit; there is a commandment in the way, and that is as
   terrible to a gracious heart as an angel with a flaming sword.

   To back these thoughts, let me propound a few considerations.
   Consider--

   1. God can command what he will. He is absolute. His will is the
   supreme reason of all things. It is notable that God backs his laws
   with the consideration of his sovereignty. You shall do thus and thus.
   Why? I am the Lord.' That is all his reason, Lev. xviii. 4, 5. It is
   repeated in that and many places in the next chapter. The Papists speak
   much of blind obedience, obeying their superiors without inquiring into
   the reason of it. Surely we owe God blind obedience, as Abraham obeyed
   God, not knowing whither he went,' Heb. xi. 8. John Cassian makes
   mention of one who willingly fetched water near two miles every day,
   for a whole year together, to pour it upon a dead dry stick, at the
   command of his superior, when no reason else could be given for it. And
   I have read of another who professed that, if he were enjoined by his
   superior to put forth to sea in a ship that had neither mast, tackling,
   nor any other furniture, he would do it; and when he was asked how he
   could do this without hazard of his discretion, he answered, The wisdom
   must be in him that hath power to command, not in him that hath power
   to obey. Thus do they place merit in this blind obedience, in giving up
   their wills absolutely to the power of their superior. Certainly, in
   God's commands, his sovereignty is enough; the uttermost latitude of
   this blind obedience is due to him. If he hath said it is his will, how
   contrary soever it be to our reason, lusts, interests, it must be done.
   It is enough for us to know that we are commanded. To command is God's
   part, and to obey that is ours, whatever shall be declared to be his
   will and pleasure.

   2. God can most severely punish our disobedience, and therefore his
   commands should have a power upon us: James iv. 12, There is one
   lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy;' with a destruction
   indeed, and salvation indeed. So there is but one lawgiver in this
   sense. He truly hath potestatem vitae et necis. God hath the power of
   life and death. Why? Because he can punish with eternal death, and
   bestow eternal life.

   3. He is neither ignorant nor forgetful of our prevarications and
   disobedience. The Rechabites were tender of the commandment of their
   dead father, Jer. xxxv., who could not take cognisance of their
   actions: Our father commanded us.' Certainly we should be tender of the
   commands of the great God: Prov. xv. 3, The eyes of the Lord are in
   every place, beholding the evil and the good.' He is not so shut up
   within the curtain of the heavens but that he takes notice how his laws
   are kept and observed. Saith the prophet to Gehazi, Went not my spirit
   with thee?' meaning his prophetical spirit. So doth God, as it were,
   appeal to the conscience of a sinner. Doth not my spirit go along with
   thee? Is not he conscious to our works, and observes all we do?

   4. God stands much upon the authority of his law: Hosea viii. 12, I
   have written to them the great things of my law,' &c. Mark, he calls
   them the great things of his law;' they are not things to be slighted
   and contemned. They are not directions of little moment; there is no
   small hazard in contemning them, or not walking according to them.
   Indeed, we think it a small matter to stand upon every circumstance;
   but God doth not think so. Uzzah was struck dead in the place for
   failing in a circumstance--he would stay the ark, which shook. The
   Bethshemites, sinning in a circumstance, it cost them the lives of many
   thousands. Lot's wife, for looking back, was turned into a pillar of
   salt. Let these things beget an awe upon our hearts of the great God,
   and of what he hath enjoined us.

   Use 2. It informs us of the heinous nature of sin. Of sin in general,
   it is anomia , a transgression of the law,' 1 John iii. 4; that is, a
   contempt of God's authority. It is an unlording of him and putting him
   out of the throne. Every sin is an affront to God's authority; it is a
   despising of the command, 2 Sam. xii. 9; you rise up in defiance to
   God, and cast off his sovereignty in despising his command; more
   particularly, sins against knowledge, or against conscience. You may
   see the heinousness of these sins by this--all sins, they proceed
   either from ignorance, or from oblivion, or from rebellion. Sins of
   ignorance, they are not so heinous, though they are sins. A man is
   bound to know the will of his creator; but then ignorance of it is not
   so heinous. To strike a friend in the dark is not so ill taken as in
   the open light. So there are sins of oblivion, which is an ignorance
   for the time, for a man hath not such explicit thoughts as to revive
   his knowledge upon himself. He is overtaken, Gal. vi. 1. This a great
   sin too. Why? For the awe of God should ever be fresh and great upon
   the heart, and we are to remember his statutes to do them.' But now,
   there are sins of rebellion, that are committed against light and
   conscience, whether they be of omission or commission. We are troubled
   for sins of commission against light; we should be as much for sins of
   omission, for they are rebellions against God, when we omit a duty of
   which we are convinced: James iv. 17, To him that knoweth to do good,
   and doth it not, to him it is sin.'

   Secondly, Come we to the manner of this obedience, Thou hast commanded
   us to keep thy precepts diligently. From thence note--

   Doct. That we should not only do what God hath required, but we should
   do it diligently.

   1. Because the matter of keeping God's precepts doth not only fall
   under his authority, but the manner also. God hath not only required
   service, but service with all its circumstances: 1 Cor. ix. 24, I so
   run that I may obtain.' It is our duty, not only to run, but so run,
   not as in jest, but as in good earnest: Rom. xii. 11, Fervent in
   spirit, serving the Lord.' Not only serving the Lord, but seething hot
   in spirit, when our affections are so strong that they boil over in our
   lives. And James v. 16, The fervent effectual prayer;' that prayer
   which hath a spirit and a life in it. Not only prayer is required, but
   fervency, not dead and drowsy devotion. So Luke vii. 18, not only it is
   required that we hear, but to take heed how we hear,' with what
   reverence and seriousness. And Acts xxvi. 7, The twelve tribes served
   God instantly, day and night,' with the uttermost extension of their
   strength, so the word signifies. And for charity, it is not enough to
   give, but with readiness and freeness. Be ready to communicate;' like
   life-honey it must drop of its own accord.

   2. The manner is the great thing which God requires; it is very
   valuable upon several grounds: Prov. xvi. 2, The ways of man are clean
   in his own eyes; but the Lord weigheth the spirits.' What doth God put
   into the balance of the sanctuary when he comes to make a judgment?
   When he would weigh an action he weighs the spirits. He considers not
   only the bulk, the matter of the action, but the spirit, with what
   heart it was done. A man may sin in doing good, but he cannot sin in
   doing well; therefore the manner should be looked to as well as the
   matter.

   3. It is a good help against slightness. We are apt to put off God with
   anything, and therefore we had need to rouse up ourselves to serve him
   with diligence: Josh. xxiv. 19, You cannot serve the Lord, for he is a
   jealous God,' &c. It is another matter to serve the Lord than the world
   thinks of. Why? For he is holy and jealous; he is holy, and so hates
   the least failing; and very jealous, sin awakens the displeasure of his
   jealousy--he will punish for very little failings. Ananias and Sapphira
   struck dead in the place for one lie; Zacharias struck dumb for an act
   of unbelief; Moses, for a few rash words, never entered into the land
   of Canaan; David, for a proud conceit in numbering the people, lost
   seventy thousand men with the pestilence; the Corinthians, many of them
   died for unworthy receiving. God is the same God still: he hates sin as
   much as ever; therefore we should not be slight.

   4. It is a dishonour to God to do his work negligently: Mal. i. 14,
   Cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth and
   sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing, for I am a great king, saith
   the Lord;' implying that it is a lessening of his majesty. It is a sign
   we have cheap thoughts of God, when we are slight in his service.
   Christians, we owe our best to God, and are to serve him with all our
   might: Deut. vi. 5, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
   heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy might.' It is a lessening of
   his excellency in our thoughts when everything serves the turn.

   5. Keeping the commandment, it is a great trust. God hath left this
   trust with us that we should keep his precepts, therefore it is to be
   discharged seriously. A man is very careful that hath taken a trust
   upon him to preserve it. No men that have given up their names to
   Christ, but they have taken up this trust upon them to keep his
   precepts; therefore we should do it with all diligence and needfulness
   of soul.

   6. We have no other plea to evidence our sincerity; we are guilty of
   many defects, and cannot do as we would,--where lies our evidence then?
   When we set ourselves to obey, and aim at the highest exactness to
   serve him with our best affections and strength. A child of God, he
   doth not do all that God hath required, but he doth his best, and then
   that is a sign the heart is upright. For what is this diligence, but
   our utmost study and endeavour after perfection, to avoid all known
   evils, and to practise all known duties, and that with as much care as
   we can? Now, this is an argument of our sincerity, and then our slips
   are but failings which God will spare, pity, pardon: Mal. iii. 17, I
   will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him,' &c.
   Where a man is careless, and failings are allowed, then they are
   iniquities. A father, out of indulgence, may pass by a failing when his
   son waits upon him, suppose when he spills the wine and breaks the
   glass; but surely will not allow him to throw it down carelessly or
   wilfully. We have no other plea to evidence our sincerity but this.

   Use. It presseth us, whatever we do for the great God, to do it with
   all our might, Eccles. ix. 10. There is no weighty thing can be done
   without diligence; much more the keeping the commandment. Satan is
   diligent in tempting, and we ourselves are weak and infirm; we can not
   do the least thing as we should. And the danger of miscarrying is so
   great, that surely it will require all our care. Wherein should we show
   this diligence and exactness? When we keep all the parts of the law,
   and that at all times and places, and that with the whole man.

   1. When we strive to keep the law in all the points of it. This was
   Paul's exercise: Acts xxiv. 16, To keep a good conscience void of
   offence both towards God and man.' Mark, here was his great business;
   this is to be diligent, when a man labours to keep a good conscience
   always. And saith he, Herein, or upon this do I exercise myself; that
   is, upon this encouragement, upon hope of a blessed resurrection, for
   that is spoken of there. There are wages and recompenses enough in
   heaven, therefore we should not grudge at a little work, that we may
   not be drawn willingly from the least part of our duty.

   2. When we do it at all times and places, and in all company, then it
   is a sign we mind the work, then are we diligent: Ps. cvi. 3, Blessed
   is he that doth righteousness at all times.' Not only now and then, but
   it is his constant course. We do not judge men's complexions by the
   colour they have when they sit before the fire. We cannot judge of men
   by a fit and pang when they are under the awe of an ordinance, or in
   good company; but when at all times he labours to keep up a warmth of
   heart towards God.

   3. When he labours to do this with his whole man, not only in pretence,
   and with his body, or outward man, but with inward affections: Rom. i.
   9, My God, whom I serve in the spirit.' And the true people of God are
   described: Phil iii. 3, To worship God in the spirit.' When they labour
   to bring their hearts under the power of God's precepts, and do not
   only mind conformity of the outward man, this is to keep the precepts
   of God diligently. All this is to be under stood, not in exact
   perfection; but it is to be understood of our striving, labouring,
   watching; of our praying, and of our exercising ourselves hereunto,
   that we may with our whole man come under the full obedience of the law
   of God, and may manifest it upon all occasions, at all times, in all
   companies and places; and this is an evidence of our sincerity.

SERMON VI.

   Oh that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!--Ver. 5.

   IN the former verse he had spoken of God's authority; now he beggeth
   grace to obey: Thou hast commanded;' and Oh that my ways were directed
   to keep thy statutes!'

   1. Note, that it is the use and duty of the people of God to turn
   precepts into prayers.

   That this is the practice of God's children appeareth: Jer. xxxi. 18,
   Turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art the Lord my God.' God
   had said, Turn you, and you shall live;' and they ask it of God, Turn
   us,' as he required it of them. It was Austin's prayer, Da quod jubes,
   et jube quod vis, Give what thou requirest, and require what thou wilt.
   It is the duty of the saints; for--1. It suiteth with the
   gospel-covenant, where precepts and promises go hand in hand, where God
   giveth what he commandeth, and worketh all our works in us,' and for
   us. They are not conditions of the covenant only, but a part of it.
   What God hath required at our hands, that we may desire at his hands.
   God is no Pharaoh, to require brick where he giveth no straw. Lex
   jubet, gratia juvat. The articles of the new covenant are not only put
   into the form of precepts, but promises. The law giveth no strength to
   perform anything, but the gospel offereth grace. 2. Because by this
   means the ends of God are fulfilled. Why doth God require what we
   cannot perform by our own strength? He doth it--(1.) To keep up his
   right; (2.) To convince us of our impotency, and that upon a trial;
   without his grace we cannot do his work; (3.) That the creature may
   express his readiness to obey; (4.) To bring us to lie at his feet for
   grace.

   Now, when we turn precepts into prayers, all these ends are
   accomplished.

   [1.] To keep up his right. If we have lost our power, there is no
   reason God should lose his right. A drunken servant is under the
   obligation and duty of a servant still; he is unable to do his master's
   work, bat he is bound to it. It is unreasonable that another should
   surfer through my default. Well, then, God may well command the fallen
   creature to keep his precepts diligently. Now, when we deal earnestly
   with God about it, it argueth a sense of his authority upon our hearts.
   If we were not held under the awe of the commandment, why should we be
   so earnest about it? If men were more sensible of their obligations, we
   should have more prayers in this kind. This is the will of God, and how
   shall I do to observe it?

   [2.] To convince us of our impotency, and that upon a trial. Practical
   conviction is best. We may discourse of the weakness and in sufficiency
   of the creature, but we are not affected with it till we try. A
   diseased man as long as he sits still feels not the lameness of his
   joints, but upon exercise it is sensible. Now, these prayers are a
   profession of weakness upon a trial: Rom. vii. 18, For to will is
   present with me; but how to perform that which is good, I find not.'
   That presupposeth a search, not I cannot, but I find not, and then we
   run to prayer. Every prayer is an acknowledgment of our weakness and
   dependence. Who would ask that of another which he thinketh to be in
   his own power?

   [3.] That the creature may express his readiness. God will have us
   will, though we cannot do. It is true he giveth both: Phil. ii. 13, For
   it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good
   pleasure.' But the one by preventing, the other by assisting grace,
   Rom. vii. 18. Though we are unable to do what we should, yet it is the
   desire of our hearts. Prayer is the expression of our desire. When we
   heartily beg grace, it is a sign the commandment is not grievous, but
   our lusts. It much discovereth a man's heart, what he counteth to be
   his bondage and the yoke: 1 John v. 3, For this is the love of God,
   that we keep his commandments; and his commandments are not grievous.'
   Which do we groan under? the burden of the law, or the body of death?
   That is best seen by our heartiness in prayer.

   [4.] To bring us to lie at his feet. God will be owned not only as a
   lawgiver, but as a fountain of grace. The precept cometh from God to
   drive us to God; his sovereignty maketh way for his grace. He calleth
   upon us for obedience, that we may call upon him for help. First, he
   giveth us a law, that he may afterwards give us a heart. God's end is
   to bring us upon our knees. As hard providences conduce to bring God
   and us together, so do hard commandments. Till we be reduced to a
   distress, we never think seriously of dealing with God.

   Use. It teacheth us what to do when we meet with anything that is
   difficult and impossible to us; as to repent, believe, to renounce a
   bewitching lust, or perform a spiritual duty. Two ways we are apt to
   miscarry in such a case; either by murmuring against God, as if he were
   harsh and austere, and had reaped where he hath not sown, and gathered
   where he hath not strewed;' or by casting off all out of a foolish
   despondency: cut at heart, or else wax faint. These are the two evils.
   I shall never get rid of this naughty heart. Or else we fret against
   God: Prov. xix. 3, The foolishness of man perverteth his way; and his
   heart fretteth against the Lord.' Now to prevent these evils, spread
   the case before the Lord in this manner--

   (1.) Acknowledge the debt. God will keep up the sense of his authority;
   his command must be the reason of our care, as well as his promise the
   ground of our hope. (2.) Confess your impotency: 2 Cor. iii. 5, Not
   that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves;
   but our sufficiency is of God.' This is to empty the bucket before we
   go to the fountain. When we are full of self, there is no room for
   grace. (3.) Own God's power: Mat. xix. 26, But Jesus beheld them, and
   saith unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things
   are possible.' The difficulties that we meet with in the way to heaven
   should serve only to make us despair of our own strength and abilities,
   not of God's, with whom nothing is impossible. It is a relief to
   consider of the divine power, from whence we fetch all our supplies
   necessary to life and godliness. (4.) Deal with God earnestly about
   help. The command showeth how pleasing such requests are to God, and
   you own God not only as a lawgiver, but author of grace. Do not come in
   a lukewarm, careless fashion, but Oh that my heart were directed!'
   Sluggish wishes will do no good; you bespeak your own denial when you
   ask grace as a thing of course: Jer. xxxi. 18, I have surely heard
   Ephraim bemoaning himself thus, Thou hast chastised me, and I was
   chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke: turn thou me, and I
   shall be turned; for thou art the Lord my God.'

   2. The next thing that we may note, is the serious desire that is in
   God's people after holiness. Mark, it is not a velleity, but a
   volition, Oh that, noteth the vehemency and heartiness.

   It is his first desire. David had hitherto spoken assertively; when he
   cometh to speak supplications, his first and chief request to God is,
   Oh that my ways were directed!' &c.

   Mark again, it is not a desire of happiness, but holiness; not Oh that
   I were blessed!' but Oh that my ways were directed!' A mind to know, a
   will to obey, and a memory to keep in mind God's precepts.

   It is practical holiness: Oh that my ways!' God hath his ways: They
   walk in his ways,' ver. 3. And we have our ways: Oh that my ways were
   directed!' that is, all my thoughts, counsels, inclinations, speeches,
   actions, were directed by thy statutes. Every commandment is a royal
   edict, a statute which God hath made for the governing of the world.

   Now the saints have this desire of holiness--

   [1.] From the new nature that is in them. The appetite followeth the
   nature: Gal. v. 17, The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the
   spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other;
   go that ye cannot do the things that ye would.' Desires being the
   vigorous bent of the soul, discover the temper of it. The carnal nature
   puts forth itself in lustings, so doth the new nature. The main thing
   we have by grace is a new heart, that is, new loves, new desires, and
   new delights: Rom. viii. 5, For they that are after the flesh do mind
   the things of the flesh, but they that are after the spirit the things
   of the spirit.'

   [2.] Out of love to God, which implieth subjection and conformity to
   him. Love to God is testified by a desire of subjection; for his love
   is a love of bounty, ours a love of duty: 1 John v. 3, For this is the
   love of God, that we keep his commandments; and his commandments are
   not grievous.' It is the great desire of their souls that they may be
   subject to God. As he that loveth would not offend the party loved, so
   it is their desire to please God in all things; and as holiness
   implieth a conformity to God, they study to be like him. It is their
   hope, their desire, their care. Their hope: 1 John iii. 2, But we know
   that when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him
   as he is.' It is their desire and care in every ordinance: 2 Cor. iii.
   18, But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the
   Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by
   the Spirit of the Lord.' And it is their constant endeavour: 1 Peter i.
   15, But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all
   manner of conversation.'

   [3.] Out of experience of the ways of God, of that goodness and
   enlargement of heart that is to be found in them. They have tasted and
   seen how good his laws are. They can answer God's appeal, Do not my
   words do good to him that walketh uprightly?' Yea, doubt less, it is
   good: Ps. xix. 10, 11, The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous
   altogether. More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine
   gold; sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. Moreover, by them is
   thy servant warned, and in keeping of them there is great reward.' The
   spiritual life is interlined and refreshed with many sweet experiences.

   The use here is, first, a note of discovery; for men are judged by
   their desires, rather than their practices, as being freest from
   constraint; and this is humbly represented by the children of God, to
   incline his favour and compassion to them: Neh. i. 11, Let thine ear be
   attentive to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name.'
   They come short in many things, but they desire to fear God: Isa. xxvi
   8 The desires of our soul are to thy name, and to the remembrance of
   thee.' They could speak little of what they had done for God Paul was
   better at willing than performing, till freed from this body of death:'
   Rom. vii. 18, For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no
   good thing; for to will is present with me, but how to perform that
   which is good I find not.' This will be our best evidence to the last,
   Oh that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!'

   But may not wicked men have good desires?

   Ans. They may have a loose inclination to good things, but not a full
   resolution for God. Wicked men have an enlightened conscience, but no
   renewed wills. This enlightened conscience may carry them so far, as to
   some general approbation of the things of God, which may produce a wish
   that they were so and so; but this doth no good to the heart. Sparks do
   not kindle the fire, but coals: a spark is enough to set us on fire in
   carnal matters, but not in spiritual. More distinctly--

   [1.] Wicked men may desire their own happiness, though not upon God's
   terms: Num. xxiii. 10, Oh that I might die the death of the righteous,
   and let my last end be like his!' At oportuit sic vixisse. John vi. 34,
   Evermore give us of this bread' of life. Everyman would be blessed, and
   go to heaven, if it were left to his option and choice; they like the
   end, but not the means. There was not a murmuring Israelite but would
   count Canaan a good land; but the giants and sons of Anak were there.

   [2.] They may have some languid and vanishing motions towards the means
   as well as the end, being convinced of the necessity of holiness; yea,
   they may draw out their wishes into a cold prayer that God would make
   them better; as lazy persons sometimes express their desires, Would I
   were at such a place, and never travel! Would I had written such a
   task, and never put pen to paper!--Vellent sed nolunt. When it cometh
   to trial, they do not set themselves in good earnest to get that grace
   they wish for.

   What is the difference between a volition and a velleity?

   (1.) Such desires as are not waving, but resolute and fixed. Aquinas
   saith, Velleitas est voluntas incompleta, a half will. They have a
   month's mind to that which is good, but not a thorough resolution; as
   Agrippa, almost persuaded, but not altogether; such a desire as will
   bear up against a strong tide of opposition. It is called the setting
   of the heart:' 1 Chron. xxii. 19, Now set your heart and your soul to
   seek the Lord your God.' Whatever cometh of it, they must and will have
   grace: Ps. xxvii. 4, One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I
   seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of
   my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his
   temple.'

   (2.) Such desires as are absolute, and do not stand upon terms. There
   is an hypothetical and conditional will. We would, but with such
   conditions. I would have Christ, if it did not cost me so dear--to deny
   lusts, interests, friends, relations, much waiting, praying, watching,
   striving. So Mat. xxii. 5, they would come to the supper; but house,
   oxen, farm, merchandise--there was something in the way that hindered
   them: there was no full and perfect will. A chapman no doubt would have
   the wares he liketh, but will not come to the price. I will have
   heaven, whatever it cost me, is the voice of a desiring saint.

   (3.) Such desires as are active and industrious; not a remiss will:
   Prov. xiii. 4, The soul of the sluggard, desireth, and hath nothing;
   but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat.' Cold, raw wishes are
   unuseful and fruitless; we must work as well as wish. Poor, languid,
   inactive desires come to nothing, when men do not put forth their
   endeavours, and apply themselves to the prosecution of what is desired.
   Faint and sluggish velleities do hurt: Prov. xxi. 25, The desire of the
   slothful killeth him; for his hands refuseth labour.' Whatever a man
   doth seriously desire to have, he will use proper means to procure it.
   Wishes are but the fruits of a speculative fancy, rather than an
   industrious affection.

   (4.) Such desires as are constant, and not easily controlled by other
   desires. Idle, lazy wishes, ineffectual glances, sudden motions, while
   their hearts are detained in the speculation of holiness, are like
   children's desires, soon put out of the humour. There may be vehement
   and sudden lustings in an unregenerated person; free-will hath its
   pangs of devotion. But the apostle declares: Rom. vii. 18, To will is
   present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.' It
   is a constant habitual will, not a volatile devotion, that cometh upon
   us now and then; but such a will as is present, as sin is present. He
   had said before, When I would do good, evil is present with me.'
   Whithersoever you go, you carry a sinning nature about with you. It is
   present, urging the heart to vanity, folly, lust; so should this will
   be present with you, urging the heart to good.

   (5.) Such desires are joined with serious groans and sorrow for our
   defects. He cannot be so good as he would, but desireth and
   complaineth; therefore God accepteth of the will for the deed: Rom.
   vii. 24, O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body
   of this death?' Though an unrenewed man seem to desire grace, yet he
   feeleth no grief in the want of grace, it never troubleth him; his
   desires do not break out into groans and bitter complaints, because of
   indwelling corruption. Now, by these things may you try your hearts.

   3. The third thing observable from hence, is the necessity of directing
   grace, Oh that my ways were directed!'

   I shall first premise some distinctions--

   [1.] There is a general direction, and a particular direction. (1.) The
   general direction is in the word; there God hath declared his mind in
   his statutes: He hath showed thee, O man, what is good,' Micah vi. 8.
   (2.) A particular direction by his Spirit, who doth order and direct us
   how to apply the rule to all our ways: Isa. lviii. 11, The Lord shall
   guide thee continually.' Now, this particular direction is either to
   our general choice: Ps. xvi. 7, I will bless the Lord, who hath given
   me counsel.' It is the work of God only to teach us how to apply the
   rule so as to choose him for our portion. Or secondly, as to acts and
   orderly exercise of any particular grace; so 2 Thes. iii. 5, The Lord
   direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting
   for Christ.' Or thirdly, as to the management of our civil actions; as
   the pillar of the cloud went before the Israelites in their journeys,
   so doth God still guide his people in all their affairs, both as to
   duty and success. As to duty: Prov. iii. 6, In all thy ways acknowledge
   him, and he shall direct thy paths.' Ask his counsel, leave, and
   blessing: in doubtful things ask his counsel; in clear cases ask his
   leave, Shall I go up or not?' and then ask his blessing. As to success:
   Prov. xvi. 9, A man's heart deviseth his way; but the Lord directeth
   his steps.' Events cross expectation; we cannot foresee the event of
   things in the course of a man's life, what is expedient, and what not:
   Prov. xx. 24, Man's goings are of the Lord; how can a man, then
   understand his own way?' We purpose and determine many things rightly,
   and according to rule, but God disposeth of all events: Rom. i. 10,
   Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous
   journey by the will of God, to come unto you.' God brought Paul to Rome
   by a way he little thought of. Therefore we need to call God to
   counsel, and to inquire of the oracle in all matters that concern
   family, commonwealth, or church. We need a guide: Jer. x. 23, O Lord, I
   know that the way of man is not in himself; neither is it in man that
   walketh to direct his steps.' Affairs do not depend on our policy or
   integrity, but on the divine providence, who ordereth every step, to
   give such success as he pleaseth.

   [2.] Distinction. There is a literal direction, and an effectual
   direction. (1.) The literal direction is by that speculative knowledge
   that we get by the word: Ps. cxix. 105, Thy word is a lamp unto my
   feet, and a light unto my path,' sufficient not only for general
   courses, but particular actions. (2.) The effectual direction is by the
   Holy Ghost applying the word, and bending the heart to the obedience of
   it: Isa. lxi. 8, I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an
   everlasting covenant with them,'--that is, I will so show them their
   way, as to work their hearts to the sincere obedience of it.

   Now, to give you the reasons for the necessity of this direction, three
   things prove it--

   (1.) The blindness of our minds. We are wise in generals, but know not
   how to apply the rule to particular cases. The heathens were vain en
   tois dialogismois, in their imaginations.' Rom. i. 21. And the same is
   true of us Christians: though we have a clearer knowledge of God, and
   the way how he will be served and glorified; yet to suit it to
   particular cases, how dark are we! A dial may be well set, yet, if the
   sun shine not upon it, we cannot tell the time of the day. The
   scriptures are sufficient to make us wise; but without the light of the
   Spirit, how do we grope at noonday!

   (2.) The forgetfulness of our memories. We need a monitor to stir up in
   us diligence, watchfulness, and earnest endeavours: Isa. xxx. 21, And
   thine ears shall hear a word behind thee saying, This is the way, walk
   ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the
   left.' The cares and businesses of the world do often drive the sense
   of our duty out of our minds. One great end of God's Spirit is to put
   us in remembrance, to revive truths upon us in their season. A ship,
   though never so well rigged, needs a pilot; we need a good guide to put
   us in mind of our duty.

   (3.) The obstinacy of our heart. So that we need every moment to
   enforce the authority of God upon us; and to persuade us to what is
   right and good. The Spirit's light is so directive, that it is also
   persuasive; there needs not only counsel, but efficacy and power. We
   have boisterous lusts, and wandering hearts; we need not only to be
   conducted, but governed. We have hearts that love to wander,' Jer. xiv.
   10; we are sheep that need a shepherd, for no creature is more apt to
   stray: Ps. xcv. 10, It is a people that do err in their hearts:' not
   only ignorant, but perverse; not in mind only apt to err, but love to
   err. Thus you see the necessity of this direction, Oh that my ways were
   directed to keep thy statutes!'

   The uses. Well, then, give the Lord this honour, of being your
   continual guide: Ps. xlviii. 14, For this God is our God for ever and
   ever; he will be our guide even unto death.' You do not own him as a
   God, unless you make him your guide: Ps. lxxiii. 24, Thou shalt guide
   me with thy counsel, and afterwards receive me to glory.' In vain do
   you hope for eternal life else. Therefore--

   1. Commit yourselves to the tuition of his grace. A man is to choose
   God for a guide, as well as to take him for a lord; to ask his counsel
   as well as submit to his commandments: Jer. iii. 4, Wilt thou not from
   this time cry unto me, My Father, thou art the guide of my youth?'

   2. Depend upon him in every action. The steps of a good man are ordered
   by the Lord;' all his particular actions: Rom. viii. 26, For we know
   not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit itself maketh
   intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.'

   3. Seek his counsel out of a desire to follow it: John vii. 17, If any
   man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of
   God, or whether I speak of myself.' Still walk according to light
   received, and it will increase upon you. Such as make conscience of
   known truth shall know more. He that cometh with a subjected mind, and
   fixed resolution to receive and obey, shall have a discerning spirit.
   God answereth men according to the fidelity of their own hearts.

SERMON VII.

   Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy
   commandments.--Ver. 6.

   THE Psalmist had prayed for direction to keep God's commandments: here
   he showeth the fruit and benefit of that direction.

   In the words two things are observable--

   1. The description of sincere obedience: respect to all the
   commandments.

   2. The fruit of it: then shall I not be ashamed.

   First, Observe; a sincere heart aimeth at universal obedience to God's
   law. Here are to be illustrated--

   1. All thy commandments.'

   2. Having respect' to them. The object; and the act of the soul.

   [1.] All the commandments must be taken notice of, small and great.
   (1.) Small, we cannot dispense with ourselves in the least: Mat. v. 19,
   Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and
   shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of
   heaven.' We are apt to say, It is but a little one, and my soul shall
   live.' No sin can be little that is committed against the great God. It
   argueth the more wickedness and corruption to break with God upon every
   trifling occasion. A little force will make a heavy body move downward.
   (2.) As small, so great. The ceremonialist is apt to stand much upon
   lesser things: John xviii. 28, the Jews would not enter into the
   judgment-hall, lest they should be defiled, yet they sought the life of
   the Lord of glory. Hypocrites make a great business about small
   matters, and in the meantime reject weighty duties, ta barutera tou
   nomou: Mat. xxiii. 23, Ye pay tithe of mint, and anise, and cummin, and
   have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and
   faith; these ought ye to have done, and riot to leave the other
   undone;' like one that cometh into a shop to buy a pennyworth and
   steals a pound's worth, or is punctual in paying a small debt that he
   may get deeper into our books, and cheat us of a greater sum, comply in
   circumstances and terms, which yet have their place, but make no
   conscience of greater.

   [2.] Commandments that require public, and commandments that require
   private duties: 2 Cor. vii. 1, Having therefore these promises, dearly
   beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and
   spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.' In times of trouble
   men content themselves that their hearts are right, as the libertines
   in Corinth, and think it is no matter whether they own God publicly,
   yea or nay. Then for private duties, some make a fair show to the
   world, but in their family converse are loose and careless: David
   saith, Ps. ci. 2, I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.' If
   a man be truly holy he will show it at home as well as abroad; in his
   family, where his constant converse is, yea, in his closet and secret
   retirements. A Christian is alike everywhere, because God is alike
   everywhere. We strain ourselves to put forth our gifts in public; God
   will be served with our uttermost in secret also.

   [3.] There are commandments that concern the inward as well as the
   outward man; we must make conscience of both: Isa. lv. 7, Let the
   wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let
   him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy,' &c. We must not only
   make conscience of our way, or outward actions, but also of our
   thoughts; as we must not do evil before man, so not think evil before
   God. Thoughts fall under a law as well as our actions: James iv. 8,
   Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye
   sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double-minded.'

   [4.] There are commands that concern God, and commands that concern
   man. There is a first table and a second; some are very punctual in
   dealing with men, but neglectful of God: Rom. i. 18, The wrath of God
   is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of
   men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness.' Both the tables are owned
   from heaven. Some there are that will not wrong their neighbour of a
   farthing, yet stick not to rob God of that fear, faith, and love that
   is due to him. Many will not defile their bodies with promiscuous
   copulation, but are adulterers and adulteresses, James iv. 4, running
   a-whoring from their spiritual husband, and doting on the creature.
   Many there are who condemned the rebellion of Absalom, but rise up
   against their heavenly Father; are not murderers, but strike at the
   being of God. Some there are who are very tender of wronging the
   reputation of men, yet dishonour God, and are never troubled for it.
   Others there are who are much in worship, but in their dealings with
   men are very unconscionable: they will not swear an oath, yet are very
   uncharitable, censuring their brethren without any pity or remorse.
   This is the fashion of the world, to be in with one duty, and out with
   another. The commandments are ushered in with this preface, God spake
   all these words;' he that hath enjoined one hath enjoined another. But
   now, as the echo rendereth but part of the speech, so do we in our
   return of obedience. God spake all, and we return but part.

   2. Having respect unto the commandments; that needeth illustration
   also. Though we cannot keep all, or any one of them as we should, yet
   we must have regard to all, and that equally without any distinction.

   When have we an equal respect to all? I answer, Three ways--(1.)
   Proposito; (2.) Affectu; (3.) Conatu.

   [1.] Proposito, in vow and purpose. We must approve of all, and choose
   all for our rule, without reservation and indulgence. Some commands are
   more contrary than others to our lusts and interests, and are less in
   our power to perform. Now, a sanctified judgment must approve all, and
   a sanctified will accept and choose all as equally good, necessary, and
   profitable for us: Rom. vii. 12, The law is holy, and the commandment
   holy, just, and good'--the law in general, nay, that commandment which
   had wrought such tragical effects in his heart. It is holy, as being
   the copy of God's purity; just, as doing us no wrong, being no
   infringement of our just freedom; good, as being very profitable to
   direct and perfect our operations, and to make us happy here and
   hereafter. But this approbation is not enough, there must be consent:
   ver. 16, I consent to the law that it is good,' though it is contrary
   to my natural inclinations. It is a good law, the heart must be
   engaged, I will write my laws upon their hearts, and put them into
   their minds.' God doth not only give us a knowledge, or a single
   approbation of his will, but a will to choose it as our rule to live
   by. The heart is suited and inclined to it, and a man giveth up himself
   faithfully and entirely to serve God according to the direction of his
   word.

   [2.] Affectu. There must be a sincere affection to all, or a care to
   keep them. We must not entertain affection to any known sin: Ps. lxvi.
   18, If I regard iniquity in my heart, God will not hear me.' A man may
   have a great deal of sin in his heart, but if he cherish and dandle it,
   and have a regard to it, he is one whom God will not accept His desire
   is not to offend God, and it is his trouble when corruption gets the
   start of grace. If a king warneth a city of traitors, and calleth upon
   them to search them out, and send them away, and they never regard the
   message, but willingly give them harbour and entertainment, then it is
   a sign they are disaffected to him: to cherish a sin after warning is
   an open rebellion against God.

   [3.] Conatu, in endeavour. We must keep all, conatu, licet non eventu;
   it is our labour, though not our success. Those that dispense with any
   commandment voluntarily and willingly, have never yet learned the way
   of true obedience to God: 2 Kings v. 18, In this thing the Lord pardon
   thy servant, that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to
   worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house
   of Rimmon: when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, the Lord pardon
   thy servant in this thing.' This is to set up a toleration in our
   hearts, and to make Satan some allowance, to part stakes between God
   and the devil. There is something wherein we would be excused, and
   expect favour in fashions, customs, ways of profit and advantage. The
   endeavour must be to keep all, though the success be not answerable. A
   mariner that is beaten back by the winds, yet proveth [4] to hold on
   his course to make his port. A man that would sit warm shutteth the
   door and windows, yet the wind will creep in, though he doth not leave
   any open passage for it.

   Now, the reasons why we are to have respect to all the commandments are
   these following:--

   1. Because they are all ratified by the same authority. There is a
   connection between them, as there is between links in a chain; take
   away one, and all falleth to pieces: James ii. 10, For whosoever shall
   keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.'
   The authority of the law is lost if men may pick and choose as they
   please. He that said, Thou shalt do no murder,' hath also said, Thou
   shalt keep my Sabbaths.' A quatenus ad omne, the argument holds. Do one
   thing as a duty, and that will enforce the practice of all duties that
   we are convinced of: Col. i. 10, Walk worthy of God in all
   well-pleasing.' He that seeketh not to please God in all things,
   seeketh not to please God in anything.

   2. Because in conversion grace is given to observe all. There is a
   universal principle to incline the heart impartially to all. God
   infuseth all grace together; not one particular only in the hearts of
   his children, but the whole law. There is a form of grace introduced
   into the soul that suits with every point of the law. The heart is
   framed to resist every sin, to observe all that God hath commanded. A
   new-born infant hath all the parts of a man, though not the strength
   and bulk; so every Christian in regeneration. Men may be born without
   hands or feet, but the new creature never cometh out maimed and
   imperfect. It is small and weak at first, but it groweth and gathereth
   strength. There is no commandment to which it is not suited. Well,
   then, not to have respect to all were to hide our talent in a napkin,
   and to receive one of God's best gifts in vain. The apostle inferreth
   it out of their calling: 1 Peter i. 15, But as he which hath called you
   is holy, so be ye holy, en pase anastrophe, in all manner of
   conversation,' at home and abroad, among infidels and with their fellow
   Christians, in prosperity and in adversity, walk worthy of your
   calling. As the sun is placed in heaven, and spreadeth his beams
   everywhere, nothing is hidden from his light; or as the lines run from
   the centre to every part of the circumference, so doth grace distil
   itself in a uniform obedience.

   3. A Christian can never be perfect in degrees if he be not perfect in
   parts. What is defective in the parts cannot be made up by any growth.
   If a man should be born without an arm or a leg, this cannot be
   supplied by future growth, he is a maimed man still; so if a man be not
   perfect in parts, hath not respect to all the commandments, he can
   never be perfect in heaven. You cannot be presented as perfect in
   Christ Jesus,' Col. i. 28.

   4. They that do not obey all, will not long obey any; but where profit
   or lust requireth it, they will break all, as Mark vi. 20, Herod feared
   John, knowing that he was a just man, and an holy, and observed him;
   and when he heared him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.' But
   one command stuck with him; being pleased with Herodias and the dancing
   damsel, that bringeth him to murder, &c. Keep but your passion a-foot,
   or your lust a-foot, or your worldliness a-foot, and it will carry you
   farther. One sin keepeth possession for Satan; allow but one lust and
   corruption in the heart, and that will under mine all, and become thine
   eternal ruin; as one leak may sink a ship. A bird tied by the leg, may
   make some show of escape. You never totally renounced Satan's
   government, and wholly gave up yourselves to God. By keeping a part,
   the whole falleth to his share.

   Use 1. It reproveth those that make one duty excuse another. Two sorts
   there are,--some that go from sins to duties, and others from duties to
   sins, that antedate or postdate indulgences. (1.) Those that antedate,
   that hope to make amends for their evil course by their duties, as when
   men allow themselves in a present carnal practice^ upon the purpose of
   an after-repentance. It is as if men should distemper the body by
   excess, and then hope to amend all by giving themselves a vomit; or
   contract a sickness voluntarily, because they will take physic.
   Certainly men would not sin so freely, if they were not borne up by
   promises of future reformation. (2.) That post date. They go from
   duties to sins: Ezek. xxxiii. 13, When I shall say to the righteous,
   that he shall surely live; if he trust to his own righteousness, and
   commit iniquity, all his righteousness shall not be remembered; but for
   his iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die for it.' If he shall
   commit a sin upon that confidence of his own righteousness. Josiah's
   breach with God, was after the preparing of the temple, 2 Chron. xxxv.
   20; even God's children take the more carnal liberty because of their
   duties.

   Use 2. Is trial. Have we this sincere respect to all the commandments?
   This may be known--

   1. By a constant desire, resolution, and endeavour to be informed of
   God's will: Rom. xii. 2, And be not conformed to this world, but be ye
   transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is
   that good, that acceptable and perfect will of God.' And Eph. v. 17,
   Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord
   is.' A man that desireth to follow God fully, would fain know the whole
   latitude and breadth of his duty. A child of God is inquisitive. He
   that desireth to keep all, doth also desire to know all. It is his
   business to study the mind of God in all things; gross negligence
   showeth we are afraid of understanding our duty.

   2. By often searching and trying his own heart, that he may find where
   the matter sticketh: Lam. iii. 40, Let us search and try our ways, that
   we may turn unto the Lord.' Complete reformation is grounded on a
   serious search. A chief cause of our going wrong is because we do not
   bring our hearts and ways together.

   3. Desire God to show it if there be anything in the heart allowed
   contrary to the word: Job xxxiv. 32, That which I see not, teach thou
   me; if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.' And Ps. cxxxix. 23,
   24, Search me, God, and know my heart; try me, and know my thoughts;
   and see if there be any wicked thing in me; and lead me in the way
   everlasting.' He would not hold on in any evil course. There is no sin
   so dear and near to him which he is not willing to see and judge in
   himself.

   4. When they fail through human infirmity or imprudence, they seek to
   renew their peace with God: 1 John ii. 1, My little children, these
   things write I unto you that ye sin not; and if any man sin, we have an
   advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.' They sue out
   their discharge in Christ's name. If a man were unclean under the law,
   he was to wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water before evening,
   and not rest in his uncleanness. Now if we still abide in our
   filthiness, and do not fly to our advocate, and sue out our pardon in
   Christ's name, it argueth that we have not a respect to the
   commandment.

   5. They diligently use all holy means which are appointed by God for
   growth in faith and obedience: 2 Cor. vii. 1, Let us cleanse ourselves
   from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the
   fear of God,' and coming up to a greater conformity.

   6. A care of their bosom-sin, to get that weakened: Ps. xviii. 23, I
   was also upright before him; and I kept myself from mine iniquity.'
   Such as are most incident to us by temper of nature, course of life, or
   posture of interests; the right hand must be cut off, the right eye
   plucked out, Mat. v. 29, 30. If thou seekest to cross that sin that is
   most pleasing to thine own heart, seekest to dry up that unclean issue
   that runneth upon thee; by that and the other signs may we determine
   whether we have a sincere respect to all God's commandments.

   Secondly, The next circumstance in the text is the fruit and benefit.
   They that have an entire respect to God's laws shall not be ashamed.

   There is a twofold shame: the shame of a guilty conscience, and the
   shame of a tender conscience.

   The one is the merit and fruit of sin; the other is an act of grace.
   This here spoken of is to be understood not of a holy self-loathing,
   but a confounding shame.

   This shame may be considered either with respect to their own hearts,
   or the world, or before God at the day of judgment.

   1. With respect to their own hearts; and thus the upright and sincere
   shall not be ashamed. There is a generous confidence bewrayed in
   duties, in troubles, and in death. (1.) In duties. They can look God in
   the face; uprightness giveth boldness; and the more respect we have
   unto the commandments, the greater liberty have we in prayer: 1 John
   iii. 21, If our hearts condemn us not, then have we confidence towards
   God.' But when men walk crookedly and loosely, they sin away the
   liberty of their hearts, and cannot come to God with such a free
   spirit. A man that hath wronged another, and knoweth not how to pay,
   cannot endure to see him; so doth sin work a shyness of God. (2.) In
   troubles and afflictions. Nothing sooner abashed than a corrupt
   conscience; they cannot hold up their heads when crossed in the world;
   a burden sits very uneasy upon a galled back; their crosses revive
   their guilt, are parts of the curse; therefore they are soon blank. But
   now a godly man is bold and courageous. Two things make one bold,
   innocency and independency; and both are found in him that hath a
   sincere respect to God's commandments. Innocency, when the soul doth
   not look pale under any secret guilt, and when we can live above the
   creatures, it puts an heroical spirit or lion-like boldness into the
   children of God. (3.) In death. To be able to look death in the face,
   it is a comfort in your greatest distresses. When Hezekiah was arrested
   with the sentence of death in the mouth of the prophet, here was his
   comfort and support, O Lord, thou knowest that I have walked before
   thee with a perfect heart.' And Job xiii. 15, Though he slay me, yet
   will I trust in him.'

   2. Before the world, a man will be able to hold up his head that is
   sincere. It is true, he may be reproached and scoffed at, and suffer
   disgrace for his strictness; yet he is not ashamed. Though we displease
   men, yet if we please God, it is enough, if we have his approbation: 1
   Cor. iv. 3, With me it is elachiston, a very small thing, that I should
   be judged of you, or of man's judgment.' To depend on the words of man
   is a foolish thing. There is more ground of rejoicing than of shame.
   You have the approbation of their consciences, when not of their
   tongues. In the issue God will vindicate the righteousness of his
   faithful servants: Ps. xxxvii. 6, He shall bring forth thy
   righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.' There
   will be no cause in the issue for a Christian to repent of his strict
   observance of God's commands.

   3. Before God at the day of judgment: 1 John ii. 28, And now, little
   children, abide in him, that when he shall appear, we may have
   confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.' He is the
   brave man that can hold up his head in that day. Wicked men will then
   be ashamed--(1.) Because their secret sins are then divulged and made
   public: 1 Cor. iv. 5, Judge nothing before the time, until the Lord
   come, will who both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and
   will make manifest the counsels of the heart, and then shall every man
   have praise of God.' (2.) Because of the frustration of their hopes.
   Disappointment bringeth shame. Some do many things, and make full
   account of their acceptance with God and reception to glory; but when
   all is disappointed, how much are they confounded! Rom. v. 5, Hope
   maketh not ashamed,' because it is not frustrated. (3.) By the contempt
   and dishonour God puts upon them, banishing them out of his presence.
   They become the scorn of saints and angels: Dan. xii. 2, And many of
   them that sleep in the dust shall arise, some to everlasting life, and
   some to shame and everlasting contempt.' But now the godly are bold and
   confident: Ps. i. 5, The ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor
   sinners in the congregation of the righteous;' but the godly shall lift
   up their head with joy and rejoicing.

   Now the reasons of this.

   Where sin is not allowed, there is a threefold comfort. (1.)
   Justification: 1 John i. 7, But if we walk in the light, as he is in
   the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus
   Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.' It is an evidence that
   giveth us the comfort. He hath failings, but they are blotted out for
   Christ's sake. (2.) It is an evidence of sanctification, that a work of
   grace hath passed upon us: 2 Cor. i. 12, For our rejoicing is this, the
   testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity,
   not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our
   conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward;' Heb. xiii.
   18, We trust that we have a good conscience, willing in all things to
   live honestly.' A universal purpose and an unfeigned respect hath the
   full room of an evidence. (3.) A pledge of glory to ensue: Rom. v. 5,
   And hope maketh not ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in
   our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.

   Use. It informeth us, by the rule of contraries, that we deceive
   ourselves if we look for anything from sin but shame: Rom. vi. 21, For
   the wages of sin is death.' Sin and shame entered into the world
   together. How were Adam and Eve confounded after the fall! Sin is
   odious to God, it grieveth the Spirit; but the person that committeth
   it shall be filled with shame. In the greatest privacy, sin bringeth
   shame. Men are not solitary when they are by themselves; there is an
   eye and ear which seeth and observeth them. There is a law in our
   hearts which upbraids our sins to us as soon as we have committed
   them--a secret bosom-witness.

   2. It informeth us what hard hearts they have that have respect to no
   commandments, yet are not ashamed. They have outgrown all feelings of
   conscience, and so glory in their shame:' Phil. iii. 19, Whose end is
   destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their
   shame, who mind earthly things.' Erubuit, salva res est. By how much
   less they are ashamed now, the more they shall be; their shamelessness
   will increase their shame: Jer. iii. 3, Thou hadst a whore's forehead,
   thou refusedst to be ashamed.' The conscience of a sinner is like a
   clock, dull, calm, and at rest, when the weights are down; but wound
   up, it is full of motion.

   3. Here is caution to God's children. The less respect you have to the
   commandments, the more shame will you have in yourselves. Partiality in
   obedience breaketh your confidence, and over-clouds your peace.
   Therefore, that we may not blemish our profession, let us walk more
   exactly. So shall we not be ashamed when we have respect to all God's
   commandments.'

SERMON VIII

   I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned
   thy righteous judgments.--Ver. 7.

   IN this verse David expresseth his esteem of the word, by telling what
   he would give for the knowledge and practice of it. As we use to tell a
   man how thankful we would be if he would do thus and thus for us; so,
   Lord, if thou wilt give me to learn thy righteous judgments, then I
   will praise thee, &c.

   His promise of praise manifesteth his esteem, which should affect our
   stupid hearts. The canon is now larger, and the mysteries of the word
   are more clearly unfolded. If the saints of God were so taken with it
   before, when there were so scanty and dark representations in
   comparison of what is now, oh, what honour and praise do we now owe to
   God!

   In this verse observe--

   1. The title that is given to the word, thy righteous judgments.

   2. His act of duty about it, or the benefit which he desireth, sound
   erudition, when I shall have learned.

   3. The fruit of this benefit obtained, then will I praise thee.

   4. The manner of performing this duty, with uprightness of heart.

   First, The title that is given to the word, Thy righteous judgments.'
   or as it is in the margin, The judgments of thy righteousness.' Hence
   observe--

   Doct. God's precepts are, and are so accounted of by his people as,
   righteous judgments, or judgments of righteousness.

   There are two terms to be explained--

   1. What is meant by judgments.

   2. By righteousness.

   For the first. Righteousness is sometimes put alone for the word, and
   so also judgments (as we shall find in this psalm); but here both are
   put together to increase the signification. The precepts of the word
   are called judgments for two reasons--

   1. Because they are the judicial sentence of God concerning our state
   and actions.

   2. Because of the suitable execution that is to follow.

   1. They are the judicial sentence of God concerning our state and
   actions. The judicial sentence; that is, they are the decrees of the
   almighty lawgiver, given forth with an authority uncontrollable. A man
   may appeal from the sentence of men, but this is judgment. This is as
   certain as if he were executed presently. There is injustice and
   oppression many times in the courts of men, but there is a higher than
   the highest regards it, and there be higher than they,' Eccles. v. 8.
   There may be another tribunal to which we may appeal from the unjust
   sentences of men; but there is no appeal from God, for there is no
   higher judicature. Paschalis, a minister of the Albigenses, when he was
   burnt at Rome, cited the Pope and his cardinals before the tribunal of
   the Lamb. When we are wronged and oppressed here, we may cite them
   before the tribunal of God and Christ; but who can appeal from the
   tribunal of Christ himself?

   And then this sentence is concerning our state and actions.

   [1.] Our state, whether it be good or evil, The word sentenceth you
   now; for instance, if a man be in a carnal state: John iii. 18, He that
   believeth not is condemned.' How condemned? already.' In the sentence
   of the law, so he is gone and lost. Every unbeliever, such as all are
   by nature, is condemned already, having only the slender thread of a
   frail life between him and the execution of it. The sentence of the law
   standeth in force against him, since he will not come to Christ to get
   it repealed. This sentence standeth in force against all heathens which
   never heard of Christ, and are condemned already by the law. But now
   Christians, or those that take up such a profession, and have heard of
   the gospel, on them it is confirmed by a new sentence, since they will
   not fly to another court, to the chancery of the gospel, and take
   sanctuary at the Lord's grace offered in Jesus Christ: He that
   believeth, and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth not
   shall be damned,' Mark xvi. 16. Again, when it is good, the sentence of
   the word, it is judgment: Rom. viii. 33, It is God that justifieth; who
   is he that condemneth?' What hath the officer to do, when a man is
   absolved by the judge in court? Conscience is God's deputy, Satan is
   God's executioner. The witness is silenced; the executioner hath no
   more to do when the judge absolveth, as God doth all by the sentence of
   the gospel that are willing to come under Christ's shadow.

   [2.] As the word judgeth and passeth sentence upon our states, so also
   upon our actions, thought, word, or deed; for all these in this regard
   come under the notion of acts.

   (1.) Thoughts. They are liable to God's tribunal, which can be
   arraigned before no other bar, yet the word doth find them out. It doth
   not only discover the evil of them: Heb. iv. 12, The word of God is
   quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even
   to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and
   marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart;'
   but judgeth and sentenceth them: Jer. vi. 19, I will bring evil upon
   this people, even the fruit of their thoughts.' Men have only a process
   against others either for words or actions, but God hath a process
   against them for their thoughts. Though in men's courts thoughts are
   free, as not liable to their cognisance, yet they are subject to
   another judicature.

   (2.) Words. Idle words weigh heavy in God's balance. God, that hath
   given a law to the heart, hath also given a law to the lips, Mat. xii.
   36, Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give an account
   thereof in the day of judgment.' Words will come to be judged: either
   we are to give an account of them here, or hereafter; either to condemn
   ourselves for them, and seek pardon, or to be condemned hereafter
   before God. A loose and ungoverned tongue will be one evidence brought
   against men as a sign of their unrenewed hearts in the day of judgment.

   (3.) All our actions. They are sentenced in the word. God hath declared
   his mind concerning them: Eccles. xii. 14, God will bring every work
   into judgment;' things will not be huddled up in that day. God will not
   accept of a general bill of account by lump, but every action he will
   judge it according to the tenor of his word. This is an amplification
   of the first reason, why the word or precepts of God are called
   judgments, because they are judicial sentences of God the lawgiver,
   given forth with an authority uncontrollable concerning our estate and
   actions.

   2. The next reason is, because of the suitable execution that is to
   follow in this world and in the next.

   [1.] In this world. It is an easy matter to reconcile the word and
   providence together, for providence is but a comment upon the word; and
   you may even transcribe God's dispensations from the threatenings and
   promises of the law. The story of the people of the Jews might have
   been transcribed from the threatenings of the law, so that the
   comminations of the law were but as a calendar and prognostication what
   kind of weather it would be with that people. So still the apostle
   makes the observation: Heb. ii. 2, Every transgression and disobedience
   received a just recompense of reward.' Mark, it is notable to observe
   how God hath been punctual in executing the sentence of every command;
   the breach of it hath had a just recompense and reward--as I might
   instance in all the law of God. Moses and Aaron, if they will not
   sanctify God according to the first commandment, they shall be shut out
   of the land of Canaan; and if the people will have their false worship,
   how will God punctually accomplish it that he will ruin, them and their
   posterity? So Rom. i. 18, you have this general a little more
   specified; God hath not only taken notice of the first table, but of
   the second: The wrath of God is revealed from heaven,' not only against
   all ungodliness,' but unrighteousness of men,' &c. God from heaven hath
   owned both tables, and executed the sentence of the law against
   sinners: Hosea vii. 12, I will chastise them as their congregation hath
   heard.' If a man would observe providence, he might find not only
   justice in God's dispensations, but truth. I rather note this, because
   God's children may smart in this life for breach of the law. Though
   sentence of absolution takes place as to their persons and state, yet
   in this life they may smart sorely for the breach of the law. In time
   of trial God will make the world know he is impartial, that none shall
   go free, but the sentence of the word shall be executed: Prov. xi. 31,
   The righteous shall be recompensed in the earth, much more the wicked
   and the sinner.' Recompensed; that is, with a recompense of punishment:
   so Peter reads it out of the Septuagint, 1 Peter iv. 18, And if the
   righteous scarcely be saved,' &c. It is a hard matter to keep a
   righteous man from falling under the vengeance of God: God stands so
   much upon the credit of his word, that he deals out smart blows and
   stripes for their iniquity here in this world.

   [2.] In the next world, there is no other sentence given but what is
   according to the word: John xii. 48, The word that I have spoken, the
   same shall judge you in the last day.' God will pronounce sentence then
   according to what is said now, either to believers or unbelievers.

   Well, then, upon these grounds you see the execution is not only
   judgment, but the very law is judgment. A man that is to be examined
   and tried for life and death would fain know how it would speed with
   him, and how matters shall be carried beforehand. God will not deal
   with you by way of surprise; he hath plainly told you according to what
   rule he will proceed: saith he, The word which I have spoken, the same
   shall judge you at the last day.'

   Use. I would apply this first term, judgments, thus: to press us to
   regard the sentence of the word more. If you cannot stand before the
   word of God, how will you stand before Christ's tribunal at the last
   day? Many times there is a conviction in the ore, though not refined to
   full conviction, and that discovers itself thus, by a fear to be tried
   and searched: John iii. 20, They will not come to the light, lest their
   deeds should be reproved.' They that are loath to know are loath to
   search: you can have no comfort but what is according to the tenor of
   the word, and no happiness but what is according to the sentence of the
   word. What the word doth say to you, as sure as God is true it will be
   accomplished to a tittle. God stands upon his word more than anything:
   when heaven and earth shall pass away,' and be burned like a scroll,'
   not a jot of the word,' either law or gospel, shall pass away.' If we
   did think of this with seriousness, then one part of the word would
   drive us to another; we would run from the law to the gospel. Sinners
   could not lie in a carnal state: this law is not only my rule, but my
   judgment; and believers could not be so listless, and secure, and
   negligent as they are in their holy calling. Their doom in the word,
   this would make them seek more earnestly for pardon and grace, and make
   them strictly watch over their hearts and ways. Either we do not
   believe that the word is true, or that God will be so punctual and
   exact as he hath declared. We dream of strange indulgences for which we
   have no cause, or else we would be more frequent at the throne of
   grace, and more exact and watchful in the course of our conversations.

   Secondly, The next term to be opened is righteousness, another title
   given to the word in this psalm: it is so called, Heb. v. 13, Unskilful
   in the word of righteousness;' and 2 Tim. iii. 16, 17, it is profitable
   for instruction in righteousness.' But why is the word called
   righteousness? Because it shows how a man shall be justified, and how a
   justified man should approve himself both to God and man.

   1. It showeth how a man shall be justified and accepted as righteous
   before God; therefore the word is called righteousness. This is a great
   secret and riddle which was hidden from the wise men of the world; they
   could never have found it out by all the profound researches and
   inquiries of nature into natural things; unless the word of God had
   made it known, it should still have been in the dark. For righteousness
   to plead for you. and to find acceptance, alas we should be thinking of
   going up to heaven, and going down into the deep; no, no, the word is
   nigh thee.' Rom. x. 8. This notion of the righteousness of Christ was
   the best notion the world was ever acquainted with; that when we all
   lay guilty, obnoxious to the wrath of God, and to the revenges of his
   angry justice, that then the Lord should reveal a righteousness, even
   the righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all
   and upon all that believe;' as the apostle amplifies it, Rom. iii. 22.
   What a rich and glorious discovery was this of the mind and counsel of
   God to poor sinners, that he hath revealed such a righteousness!

   2. The word is called righteousness, because it shows how a justified
   man should approve himself both to God and man, by a holy conversation.
   It is the rule of moral righteousness: 1 John iii. 7, He is righteous
   that doth righteousness,' in the judgment of the word. There is not
   only righteousness wrought by Christ for believers, but also
   righteousness wrought by Christ in believers, when a man doth exercise
   himself in performing his duties to God and man.

   Use. Well, then, if we would be skilful in the matters of
   righteousness--

   1. Consult often with the word, which is the copy of God's most
   righteous will. A man need go no further either for direction,
   quickening, or encouragement. The world despiseth the plain directions
   of the word, and crieth up the notion of things, and looketh for
   quainter conceits, and things of a more sublime speculation. If we
   should only bring scripture, and urge men by God's authority, and call
   upon them in Christ's name, and by Christ's arguments, this would be
   too low for them. But this is to tax the wisdom of God. He that hath
   the key of David' knew what kind of wards would fit the lock--what
   directions, what quickening notions and encouragements were fittest to
   be used in the case, to gain men to a sense of their duty both to God
   and man, and bring them into a way of righteousness.

   2. Do you manifest the word to be righteousness: Wisdom should be
   justified of her children,' Mat. xi. 19. You should evidence it to the
   carnal world by taking off their prejudices, that the word may be
   justified. The world hath a suspicion; now evidence it to the
   conscience that it is a holy rule, a perfect direction for
   righteousness. The world prieth into the conversation of the saints;
   they live much by sensible things; therefore declare and evidence it to
   be a righteous thing.

   So much for the title that is given to the word of God, thy judgments
   and righteousness.

   Secondly, We come now to his act of duty about the word, or the benefit
   which he desired, When I shall have learned.' By learning he means his
   attaining not only to the knowledge of the word, but the practice of
   it. It is not a speculative light, or a bare notion of things: John vi.
   45, Every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the Father
   cometh unto me.' It is such a learning as the effect will necessarily
   follow, such a light and illumination as doth convert the soul, and
   frame our hearts and ways according to the will of God; for otherwise
   if we get understanding of the word, nay, if we get it imprinted in our
   memories, it will do us no good without practice.

   Doct. The best of God's servants are but scholars and students in the
   knowledge and obedience of his word.

   For saith David, which had so much acquaintance, When I shall have
   learned.' The professors of the Christian religion were primitively
   called disciples or learners: Acts vi. 2, to plethos ton matheton, The
   multitude of the disciples.' This seems to be the true definition of a
   church, the genus and difference; the genus is the community or
   multitude of men united among themselves, as a corporation, city, or
   household. The difference or form is disciples, those that gave up
   themselves to Christ to be taught and governed, and to be instructed in
   this way and doctrine. So Acts xi. 26, it is said there, The disciples
   were called Christians first at Antioch.' Christians are disciples and
   to difference them from the disciples of other men, they are the
   disciples of Christ. (1.) The school, that is, the church, where there
   are public lectures read to all visible professors; but the elect
   getting saving knowledge, they are not only taught of men, but taught
   of God, they have an inward light. (2.) The book, that is, the
   scripture, which is able to make wise to salvation,' to make the man of
   God perfect,' 2 Tim. iii. 16, 17. Some run to tradition, others cry up
   their own reason to the wrong of the scripture; they make Christ to be
   their disciple rather than they his, when they will not receive things
   upon his testimony and revelation, as the Socinians. (3.) The teacher
   is either supreme or subordinate. The supreme teacher is Christ; he is
   the great prophet of the church: so it is said, John vi. 45, They shall
   be taught of God.' This is, such a teacher that not only opens the
   scripture, but opens the understanding,' Luke xxiv. 45. The subordinate
   teachers are the ministers of the gospel, whom God useth for this work;
   not out of any indigence, but indulgence; not for any efficacy in the
   preacher, but out of a suitableness to the hearer, as a means most
   agreeable to our frail estate, to deal with us by way of counsel. God
   can teach us without men, by the secret illapses of his Spirit; but he
   will use those that are of the same nature with ourselves, that have
   the same temptations, necessities, and affections, which know the heart
   of a man. He would use them who, if they deceive us, must deceive
   themselves; he would use men of whose conversation and course we are
   conscious; we know their walk and way; he would use them as
   ambassadors' to pray us in Christ's stead to be reconciled to God,' 2
   Cor. v. 20. (4.) The lesson which we learn is not only to know, but to
   obey. Science without conscience will not fit our turn, nor suit with
   the dignity of our teacher. To be like children that have the rickets,
   swollen in the head, when the feet are weak; we do not learn truth as
   it is in Jesus till we be regenerated, for that is a truth for practice
   and walking, not for talk, Eph. iv. 21. He is most learned that turns
   God's word into works: 1 John ii. 4, 5, He that saith I know him, and
   keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
   But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God
   perfected.' In this school there is no man counted a proficient, but he
   that grows in practice. It is not the curious searcher that is the best
   scholar, but the humble practitioner; when we are cast into the mould
   of this doctrine, and have the prints, the stamp and character of it
   upon our heart; as Rom. vi. 17, Ye have obeyed from the heart that form
   of doctrine which was delivered you.' In the original it is, Whereto ye
   were delivered.' When we come to a physician, it is not enough to know
   his prescriptions, but they must be followed. We do not come to Christ
   as students of physic, to be trained up in the theory, but as patients;
   not as one that minds the art, but the cure, to do what is prescribed,
   that we may know how to get rid of our soul-diseases. Therefore Christ
   saith, John viii. 31, Then are ye my disciples indeed, if my word abide
   in you.' There are Christ's disciples in pretence, and Christ's
   disciples indeed; those that make it their work to get from Christ a
   power and virtue to carry on a uniform and constant obedience, these
   are the true learners. Therefore it will not fit our turn unless we
   labour to come under the power of what we learn, as well as get the
   knowledge; and it will not suit with the dignity of our teacher, who
   doth not only enlighten the mind, but change us by his efficacy, and
   leaves a suitable impression upon the soul. God writeth the lesson upon
   our hearts; that is, not only gives us the lesson, but a heart to learn
   it. Man's teaching is a pouring it into the ears. This is God's
   teaching, to inform our reason, and move our will: Phil. ii. 13, It is
   God that worketh in you both to will and to do, of his good pleasure.'
   He teacheth us promises so as to make us believe them; and commandments
   so as to make us obey them; and the doctrine of the gospel teacheth us
   so as to stamp the impression of it upon the soul, to change us into
   his image and likeness, 2 Cor. iii. 18.

   Use. It presseth us to give up ourselves to this learning. Study the
   word, but take God for your teacher. Look to him that speaks from
   heaven if you would learn to purpose, otherwise our natural blindness
   will never be cured, nor our prejudices removed, nor our wills gained
   to God; or if they should be gained to a profession of truth, it will
   never hold long. When men lead us into a truth, we shall easily be led
   off again by other men; and all a man's teaching will never reform the
   heart. Man's light is like a March sun, which raiseth vapours, but doth
   not dispel and scatter them; so it discovers lust, but doth not give us
   power to suppress it; therefore our main business must be to be taught
   of God.

   Further, Observe your proficiency in this knowledge: Heb. v. 14, To
   have your senses exercised to discern both good and evil.' We should
   every day grow more skilful in the word of righteousness,' John xiv. 9,
   Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me,
   Philip?' To be backward in the knowledge of grace after long teaching,
   and to be still conflicting with fleshly lusts, which is the exercise
   of beginners--so much means and so small experience, and get no
   further--this is sad!

   Thirdly, The fruit of this benefit obtained, Then shall I praise him.'
   From hence observe--

   1. Upon receipt of every mercy we should praise God. We are forward in
   supplication, but backward in gratulation. This is a more noble duty,
   and continueth with us in heaven. It is the work of glorified saints
   and angels to praise God. All the lepers could beg health, yet but one
   returned to give God the glory. This is sad when it is so; for this is
   a more sublime duty, therefore it should have more of our care. This is
   a profitable duty: Ps. lxvii. 5, 6, Let the people praise thee, O Lord,
   let all the people praise thee. Then shall the earth yield her
   increase, and God, even our own God, shall bless us.' The more vapours
   go up, the more showers come down; and the more praises go up, the more
   mercies. There is a reciprocal intercourse between us and God, by
   mercies and praises, as there is between the earth and the lower
   heavens, by vapours and showers. There are two words by which our
   thankfulness to God is expressed, praising and blessing: Ps. cxlv. 10,
   All thy works shall praise thee, O Lord; and thy saints shall bless
   thee.' What is the difference? Praise respecteth God's excellences, and
   blessing respecteth God's benefits. We may praise a man that never hath
   done us good, if he be excel lent and praiseworthy; but blessing
   respecteth God's bounty and benefits; yet they are promiscuously taken
   sometimes, as here praise is taken for blessing.

   2. Observe: We should praise God especially for spiritual blessings,
   Eph. i. 3. Why? Partly because these come from the special love of God.
   God bestows corn, wine, and oil in the general upon the world; but now
   knowledge, and grace, and blessed experiences of communion with God,
   these are special things, he bestows them upon the saints, therefore
   deserves more thankfulness. Protection, it is the common benefit of
   every subject; but preferment and favour is for friends, and those that
   are near to the prince; so this is the favour of his people, called so
   Ps. cvi. 5, Show me the favour of thy people.' This is a special
   blessing God bestoweth upon his own children. Again, these concern the
   better part, the inward man, the spirit, the soul, which is the man. He
   doth us more favour which heals a wound in the body than he that only
   seweth up a rent in our garment (for the body is more than raiment); so
   he that doth good to our souls is more than he that doth good to our
   bodies, which gives outward blessings, because these are above the
   body. Again, these are pledges of eternal blessings in heavenly places:
   He hath blessed us with spiritual blessings in heavenly places.' But
   why is it said, He hath blessed us with spiritual blessings in heavenly
   places'? Why, there they began, and there they are consummated; there
   was their first purpose, and there is the final accomplishment. A man
   may have the world, and yet never the nearer heaven; but when he hath
   grace, and learned God's statutes, and his heart is gained to obedience
   of God's will, this is more than gold, silver, and great riches. Again,
   these dispose the heart to thankfulness. There is an occasion to praise
   God, and a heart to praise him; outward mercies give us an occasion,
   but spiritual mercies give a disposition. Other things are but motives
   to praise God, but these are preparations. And then other things, they
   are given in judgment; these things cannot. A man may have an estate in
   judgment, but he cannot have Christ and grace in judgment. These things
   are always given in mercy.

   Use. Well, then, the use is to reprove us that we are no more sensible
   of spiritual benefits. We love the body more than the soul, and
   therefore have a quick sense of bodily mercies. But now, in soul
   concernments we are not the like affected. It is for want of
   observation to descry the progress of grace, and God's dealings with
   the inward man: Col. iv. 2, Continue in prayer, and watch in the same
   with thanksgiving.' And it is for want of affection. We are wrought
   upon by carnal arguments, mercies of flesh and blood, and showers of
   rain, food, and gladness. These things make us praise God; but that
   which we get from God in an ordinance, we are not so sensible of.

   3. I observe again, those that have learned God's righteous judgments,
   they are only fit to praise God: Ps. xxxiii. 1, Praise is comely for
   the upright.' It is unseemly in a wicked man's mouth that he should be
   praising of God. It is his duty, but it is not so comely; but praise to
   the upright, this is suitable. Canticum novum et vetus homo male
   concordant, saith Austin. The new song, the psalm of praise, and the
   old man, make but ill music. We need a new heart, if we would go about
   this work. It is an exercise becoming the godly. We should be
   reconciled to God, and have his grace and favour. Under the law they
   were to bring their peace-offering, and lay it on the top of the
   burnt-offering, Lev. iii. When we come to offer a thank-offering to
   God, we should be in a state of amity and friendship with him. That is
   the clear moral of that ceremony: Sing with grace in your hearts,' Col.
   iii. 16. Others have not such matter nor such hearts to praise God;
   they are but tinkling cymbals. But those that have grace, it is
   acceptable and comely for them.

   4. I observe again, I will praise thee when I shall have learned,' &c.
   Those that profit by the word, they are bound to praise God, and
   acknowledge him as the author of all that they have got. The grace of a
   teachable heart, we have it from him, therefore the honour must be his.
   He that gave the law, he it is that writes it upon the heart. Alas! we
   in ourselves are but like the wild ass's colt,' Job xi. 12, both for
   rudeness of understanding, and also for unruliness of affection. Well,
   then, if we be tamed and subdued, he must have all the glory and the
   praise: Ps. xvi. 7, Blessed be God that gave me counsel in my reins.'
   It was God which made the word effectual, and counselled us how to
   choose him for our portion. We were as indocile and in capable as
   others. If God had left us to our own swing, what fools should we have
   been!

   Use. It reproves us because we are so apt to intercept the revenues of
   the crown of heaven, and to convert them to our own use, like rebels
   against God. This proud pronoun ego, I, I, is always interposing: This
   Babel which I have built.' We are sacrificing to this proud self: This
   I have done; and if God be mentioned, it is but for fashion's sake, as
   those women in the prophet Isaiah, Only call us by thy name; we will
   eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel'--I allude to it. God must
   bear the name, but we sacrifice to ourselves in all we get, as if it
   were our own acquiring. God, I thank thee,' saith the Pharisee; yet he
   trusted in himself that he was righteous, Luke viii. Oh, learn, then,
   the commendable modesty of God's servants, of ascribing all to God:
   Luke xix. 16, he doth not say my industry, but thy pound hath gained
   another.' And by the grace of God I am what I am.' And I laboured more
   abundantly than they all.' He corrects it presently, Yet not I, but the
   grace of God that was with me,' 1 Cor. xv. 10. So again: Gal. ii. 20, I
   live;' and then, presently, not I, but Christ liveth in me.' Thus
   should we learn to be faithful and loyal to God, and deal with him as
   Joab did to David when he was like to surprise Rabbah, and take it: 2
   Sam. xii. 28, Encamp against the city, and take it, lest I take the
   city, and it be called after my name.' Let us be very jealous that we
   do not get into God's place, and self interpose, and perk up with what
   we have attained unto; for the Lord must have all the glory, the praise
   must be his.

   The fourth circumstance in the text is the manner of performing this
   duty of rendering praise; with an upright heart. I shall not discourse
   of uprightness in general, but uprightness in praising God. God must be
   praised with a great deal of uprightness of soul; that is the note.
   This uprightness in praising lieth in two things,--not only with the
   tongue, but the heart; not only with the heart, but the life.

   1. Not only with the tongue, but with the heart: Ps. ciii. 1, Praise
   the Lord, my soul, and all that is within me bless his holy name.'
   Mark, not only with my tongue, with my glory,' as he calls it, but with
   my soul. Formal speeches are but an empty prattle, which God regards
   not: Ps. xlvii. 7, Sing ye praises with understanding.' It is fit the
   noblest faculty should be employed in the noblest work. This is the
   noblest work, to praise God; therefore all that is within us must be
   summoned. Church adversaries took up a customary form: Zech. xi. 5,
   Blessed be the Lord, for I am rich.' And in Nehemiah it is said, Your
   brethren that hated me said, Let God be glorious.' In instruments of
   music, the deeper the belly of the instrument, the sweeter the melody;
   so praise, the more it comes from the heart, the more acceptable to
   God.

   2. This uprightness implies the life as well as the heart. Honour given
   to God in words is many times retracted and disproved by the dishonour
   we do to him in our conversations. This is the carrying Christ on the
   top of the pinnacle, as the devil did, with an intent he might throw
   down himself again. So we seem to advance and carry him high in
   praises, that we may throw him down in our lives: Titus i. 16, They
   profess that they know God, but in works they deny him.' Empty
   compliments God accepteth not, as long as there is blasphemy in their
   lives. Our lives must glorify him: Mat. v. 16, Let your light so shine
   before men that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father
   which is in heaven.'

   Use. It reproves us that we are no more hearty and serious in the
   praises of God. In our necessities, when we want, then we can howl upon
   our bed. Our necessity doth put a shrill accent upon our groans, and
   sharpen our affections in prayer; but in praise, how cold and dull are
   we! Surely we should be as warm in the one as in the other. Then it may
   press you to live praises, and show forth the praises of him in your
   conversation, 1 Peter ii. 7. Hezekiah had been sick, God recovered him,
   he penned a psalm of thanksgiving, Isa. xxxviii. 9. Yet it is said, He
   rendered not according to what he received,' &c., 2 Chron. xxxii.,
   because his heart was proud and lifted up. If you do not walk more
   humbly and closely with God, it is not praise with uprightness of
   heart; it must issue and break out in our actions and course of our
   conversation.

SERMON IX.

   I will keep thy statutes. forsake me not utterly.--Ver. 8.

   THIS verse, being the last of this portion, is the result of his
   meditation concerning the utility and necessity of keeping the law of
   God. Here take notice--

   1. Of his resolution, I will keep thy statutes.

   2. His prayer, O forsake me not utterly.

   It is his purpose to keep the law; yet because he is conscious to
   himself of many infirmities, he prays against desertion. In the prayer
   there is a litotes, more is intended than is expressed. O forsake me
   not. He means, strengthen me in this work. And if thou shouldest desert
   me, yet but for a while, Lord, not for ever; if in part, not in whole.
   Four points we may observe from hence--

   1. That it is a great advantage to come to a resolution in a course of
   godliness.

   2. Those that resolve upon a course of obedience had need to fly to
   God's help.

   3. Though we fly to God's help, yet sometimes God may withdraw, and
   seem to forsake us.

   4. Though God seem to forsake us, and really doth so in part, yet we
   should pray that it may not be a total and utter desertion.

   The notion of statutes I have opened, and also what it is to keep them
   in mind, heart, and life. That which we are now to take notice of is
   David's resolution. Hence observe--

   Doct. 1. That it is a great advantage to come to a resolution in a
   course of godliness.

   Negatively, let me speak to this point.

   1. This is not to be understood as if our resolutions had any strength
   in themselves to bear us out. Peter is a sad instance how little our
   confidence and purposes will come to: and therefore David here, when he
   was most upright in his own resolution, is most diffident of his own
   strength; O forsake me not:' implying, if God should forsake him, all
   would come to nothing. God must enable us to do what we resolve.

   2. Nor is it to be understood that it is in a man's power to resolve;
   this would put grace under the dominion of our will; it is by
   preventing grace that we are brought to a serious purpose: Phil. ii.
   13, He giveth to will and to do.' Man's will is the toughest sinew in
   the whole creation. The very purpose and bent of the heart is the fruit
   of regeneration. Free-will hath its pangs, its velleities, which are
   like a little morning-dew, that is soon dried up: Hosea vi. 4, Our
   righteousness is as the morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth
   away.' But the will and resolution that we are to understand here is
   the fruit of grace.

   3. Not as if the obligation to obedience did arise from our own purpose
   and promise, rather than from God's command; this were to set man's
   authority above God's, and to lay aside the precept, which is the surer
   bond and obligation, and to bind the soul with the slender thread of
   our own resolutions. When we purpose and promise obedience, we do but
   make the old bond and engagement of duty the more active and sensible
   upon the soul, so that it is not to jostle out God's authority, but to
   yield our consent. However, the obligation is the greater; for to
   disobey after we have acknowledged an authority, among men it is
   counted a more heinous crime than standing out against the authority
   itself. A thing that is not due before, yet when we have promised or
   dedicated it to God, then it is not in our power; as in the case of
   Ananias, Acts v. But now we are not free before the contract, we have
   bonds upon us; and the business of our promise and resolution is only
   to make our obligation more powerful upon the conscience.

   4. Not as if it were an arbitrary thing thus to do, and practised by
   the saints only for the more convenience of the spiritual life. No; but
   it is a thing required: Acts xi. 23, He exhorteth them that, with full
   purpose of heart, they would cleave to the Lord,'

   Positively: 1. It is a course which God will bless; he hath ap pointed
   ordinances for this end and purpose that we might come to this
   resolution. The promise is first implicitly made in baptism; therefore
   is it called, 1 Peter iii. 21, the answer of a good conscience towards
   God.' How so? Why, the covenant binds mutually on God's part and on
   ours, and so do the seals which belong to the covenant. It doth not
   only seal pardon and sanctification on God's part, but there is a
   promise and answer on our part. An answer to what? To the demands of
   the covenant. In the covenant of grace God saith, I will be your God;
   baptism seals that, and we promise to be his people. Now our answer to
   this demand of God, and to this interrogatory he puts^to us in the
   covenant, it is sealed by us in baptism, and it is renewed in the
   Lord's Supper. Look, as in the old sacrifices, they were all a renewing
   of the oath of allegiance to God, or confirming their purposes and
   resolutions, you have the same notion to the sacrifice that is given to
   the Lord's Supper, for it is called the blood of the covenant,' Exod.
   xxiv. 7, 8. In the ordinance of the Lord's Supper there we come to take
   an obligation upon us; half of the blood is sprinkled upon us. And this
   purpose and resolution to it is still continued and kept afoot in our
   daily exercise, invocation, and prayer, wherein either we explicitly or
   implicitly renew our obedience; for every prayer is an implicit vow,
   wherewith we bind ourselves to seek those things we ask, or else we do
   not engage God to bestow them. Thus it is a course that God will bless.

   2. It is of great necessity to prevent uncertainty of spirit. Until we
   come to resolution we shall be liable to temptation; until we fully set
   our faces towards God, and have a bent and serious purpose of heart, we
   shall never be free from temptation from the devil, and from evil men,
   or from ourselves. From the devil: James i. 8, A double-minded man is
   unstable in all his ways.' As long as we are wavering, and suspensive,
   we can never carry on uniformity of obedience. While we halt between
   God and Baal, Satan hath an advantage against us So from evil men:
   David doth express himself as coming to a resolution in this psalm,
   ver. 115, Depart from me, ye evil-doers, for I will keep the
   commandments of my God.' There is no way to shake off those evil
   companions and associates till there be a bent seriously to wards
   heaven. So from ourselves: we have changeable hearts, that love to
   wander,' Jer. xiv. 10. We have many revoltings and reluctancies;
   therefore, until a sanctified judgment and will concur to make up a
   resolution and holy purpose, we shall still be up and down. The saints,
   being sensible of their weakness, often bind this upon themselves: Ps.
   cxix. 57, I have said that I would keep thy words;' there was a
   practical decree past upon the conscience. And ver. 106, I have sworn,
   and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.' An
   oath is the highest assurance among men, and most solemn engagement,
   and all little enough to hold a backsliding heart under a sense and
   care of our duty. As long as the Israelites had a will to Canaan, so
   long they digested the inconveniences of the wilderness. Every
   difficulty and trouble will put us out of the way, and we cannot be
   secured against an unsteady heart, but by taking up such a course, a
   serious resolve of maintaining communion with God. And as it is useful
   to prevent temptation, so to excite and quicken our dulness: we forget
   our vow and purpose, and therefore we relapse into sin. The apostle
   saith, 2 Peter i. 9, He hath forgotten that he was purged from his old
   sins;' that he did renounce these things in baptism. And Paul puts us
   in mind of our engagement: Rom. viii. 12, We are not debtors to the
   flesh, to live after the flesh.' You make vows and promises to God, to
   renounce the flesh and vanities of the world, and to give up yourselves
   to God's service; and these things are forgotten, and therefore we grow
   slight, cold, careless in the profession of godliness;

   Use. The first use is to press us to come to a declared resolution to
   serve and please God, and to direct us in what manner.

   First, Make it with a full bent of heart. Rest not upon a Shall I?
   shall I? but I will keep thy statutes.' As Agrippa was almost persuaded
   to be a Christian, but not altogether, so men stand hovering and
   debating. You should resolve, Ps. cxix. 112, I have inclined my heart
   to perform thy statutes alway to the end.' It is God's work to incline
   the heart; but when the work of grace is passed upon us, then the
   believer doth voluntarily incline himself; his will is bent to serve
   God, not by fits and starts, but alway to the end: 1 Chron. xxii. 19,
   Now set your hearts to seek the Lord;' that is, resolve, be not off and
   on.

   But, secondly, In what manner shall we make it?

   1. Seriously and advisedly, not in a rash humour. The people, when they
   heard the law, and were startled with the majesty of God, Deut. v. 28,
   29, answered, All that the Lord hath spoken we will do.' It was well
   done to come to a purpose and resolution; but Oh, that there were such
   a heart within them,' saith God, that they would fear me,' &c.: Josh.
   xxiv. 19, We will serve the Lord,' say the people;' You cannot serve
   the Lord,' saith Joshua. Do you know what it is? Rash undertakings will
   necessarily be accompanied with a feeble prosecution; and therefore
   count the charges, lest you repent of the bargain, Luke xiv. 23.

   2. Make Christ a liberal allowance, if you would come to a resolution:
   Mat. xvi. 24, He that will come after me,' he that hath a heart set
   upon this business, let him know what he must do;' let him deny
   himself,' &c. When we engage for God, he would have us reckon for the
   worst, to be provided for all difficulties. A man that builds, when he
   hath set apart such a sum of money to compass it, while he keeps within
   allowance, all is well; but when that is exceeded, every penny is
   disbursed with grudging. So if you do anything in this holy business,
   make Christ a liberal allowance at first, lest we think of returning
   into Egypt afterward, when we meet with fiery flying serpents, and
   difficulties and hardships in our passage to heaven. Let it be a
   thorough resolution, that, come what will come, we will be the Lord's.
   There should be a holy wilfulness. Paul was resolved to go to
   Jerusalem, because he was bound in spirit; and though they did even
   break his heart, yet they could not break his purpose.

   3. Resolve as trusting upon the Lord's grace. You are poor weak
   creatures; how changeable in an hour! not a feather so tossed to and
   fro in the air; therefore we shall fail, falter, and break promise
   every day, if we go forth in the strength of our own resolutions.
   Resolve as trusting in the direction and assistance of God's Holy
   Spirit: if God undertake for us, then, under God, we may undertake. To
   resolve is more easy than to perform, as articles are sooner consented
   to than made good; a castle is more easily built in time of peace than
   maintained and kept in a time of war; and therefore still wait, and
   depend upon God for his grace.

   4. You cannot promise absolute and thorough obedience, though you
   should strive after it, for this you will never be able to perform; and
   your own promises, purposes, and resolutions will but increase your
   trouble, though you are still to be aiming after it.

   Doct. 2. Those that will keep God's statutes must fly to God's help.

   As David doth here, Oh, forsake me not utterly;' that is, Oh,
   strengthen me in this work. Three reasons for this--

   1. We are weak and mutable creatures.

   2. Our strength lies in God's hands.

   3. God gives out his strength according to his own pleasure.

   1. We are weak and mutable creatures. When we were at our best we were
   so. Adam in innocency was not able to stand without confirming grace,
   but gave out at the first assault. And still we are mu table, though we
   have a strong inclination for the present. When the precepts of God are
   propounded with evidence, and backed with promises and threatenings,
   and a resolution follows thereupon, the fruit of rational conviction
   and moral suasion, which is not for the present false and hypocritical,
   yet it will not hold without the bottom of grace. It hath not
   supernatural, yet it may have moral sincerity. Such a resolution was
   that of the Israelites after the terrible delivery of God's law. They
   promised universal obedience, and did not lie in it; for God saith,
   They have done well in their promise; there was a moral sincerity, but
   there wanted a renewed sanctified heart. And those captains which came
   to Jeremiah, chap. xlii. 5, intended not to deceive for the present,
   when they called God to witness that they would do according to all
   things for the which the Lord thy God shall send thee to us.' And
   Hazael, Is thy servant a dog that he should do this thing?' Certainly
   he had abomination of it, when the prophet mentioned that cruelty of
   ripping up women with child. But suppose the resolution to be a fruit
   of grace and regeneration, yet we have not full power to stand of
   ourselves: still we are very changeable creatures in matters that do
   not absolutely and immediately concern life and death. Lot, that was
   chaste in Sodom, in the midst of so many temptations, you will find him
   committing incest in the mountains, where were none but his two
   daughters. What a change was here! David, that was so tender, that his
   heart smote him for cutting off the lap of Saul's garment, one would
   wonder that he should plot lust, be guilty of murder, and lie in that
   stupid condition for a long time. Peter, which had such courage to
   venture upon a band of men, and to cut off Malchus's ear, should be so
   faint-hearted at a damsel's question! So, while the strength of the
   present impulse and the grace of God is warm upon the heart, we may
   keep close to our work while the influence continues; but afterward,
   how cold and dead do men grow! as vapours drawn up by the sun, at night
   fall down again in a dew. The people were upon a high point of
   willingness, mighty forward, and ready to offer whole cart-loads of
   gold and silver, 1 Chron. xxix. 18. What saith David? O Lord God, keep
   this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy
   people, and stablish their heart unto thee.' We are not always in a
   like frame.

   2. Our strength lies in God, and not in ourselves. When the apostle had
   exhorted his Ephesians to all Christian duties, he concludes it thus:
   Eph. vi. 10, Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.'
   This might is in God, he is our strength. And 2 Tim. ii. 1, Be strong
   in the grace that is in Jesus Christ.' God would not trust us with the
   stock in our own hands, now we have spent our portion, and played the
   prodigals, but would have us wait upon him from morning to morning: Ps.
   xxv. 4, Show me thy ways, O Lord, teach me thy paths; lead me in thy
   truth, and teach me.' We are apt to embezzle it, or forget God, both
   which are very mischievous. When the prodigal got his stock in his own
   hands, he went into a far country, out of his father's house. God would
   not hear from us, there would not be such a constant communion and
   correspondence between him and us, if our daily necessities did not
   force us to him. Therefore, that the throne of grace might not lie
   unfrequented, God keeps the strength in his own hands. We need to
   consult with him on all occasions.

   3. God gives out his strength according to his own pleasure. God many
   times gives the will, when he suspendeth the strength that is necessary
   for the performance. Sometimes God gives scire, a sense and conscience
   of duty; at other times he gives velle, to will, to have a purpose; and
   when he gives to will, he doth not always give posse, to be able--not
   such a lively performance. It is possible he may give the will where he
   doth not give the deed; for it is said, Phil. ii. 13, He worketh both
   to will and to do of his good pleasure.' And Paul certainly doth not
   speak as a convinced, but as a renewed man, when he saith, To will is
   present with me, but how to perform that which is good, I find not.' He
   had received the will, and not the deed--finding presupposeth
   searching. When we have done all we can, yet how to bring our purposes
   into actions, we cannot tell. Peter had his resolutions (and no doubt
   they were hearty and real), yet when he comes to make them good, what a
   poor weakling was Peter! Putabat se posse, quod se velle sentiebat--he
   thought he could do that which he could will, saith Austin: John xiii.
   37, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for
   thee.' We look upon the willing spirit, and not upon the weak flesh. It
   is possible we may lean upon recent dispositions and affections, as if
   they would carry us out, without dependence upon God. Therefore, for
   all the parts of spiritual strength he must be sought to.

   The use is--

   Use. To press you to beware of presumption and self-confidence, when
   your resolutions are at the highest for God, and your hearts in the
   best frame. Resolution is needful, as was said before; but all our
   confidences must arise from God's promises, not our own, if we mean not
   to be left in the dirt. This self-confidence in spiritual things I
   shall show--

   1. How it discovereth itself.

   2. How to cure it.

   1. It discovereth itself--

   [1.] Partly thus, by venturing upon temptations without a call and
   warrant. When men will lay their heads in the lap of a temptation, and
   run into the mouth of danger, they tempt God, but trust to themselves.
   Peter would be venturing into the devil's quarters; but what is the
   issue? He denies his master. Dependence upon God is ever accompanied
   with a holy solicitude and cautelous fear, Phil. ii. 12, 13. When we go
   out of God's way it is a presuming upon our own strength; for he will
   keep us in viis, in his ways; not in praecipitiis, when we run headlong
   into danger.

   [2.] When men neglect those means whereby their graces or comforts may
   be fed and supplied. A man that is kept humble and depending will be
   always waiting for his dole at wisdom's gates, Prov. viii. 34. We
   cannot regularly expect anything from God but in God's way. They who
   depend upon God will be much in prayer, hearing, and taking all
   opportunities. But when men begin to think they need not pray so much,
   need not make such conscience of hearing; when we are more arbitrary
   and negligent in the use of means, then we be gin to live upon
   ourselves and our own stock, and do not depend upon the free grace of
   God to carry us out in our work.

   [3.] When you go forth to any work or conflict, without an actual
   renewing of your dependence upon God. It is a sign you lean upon the
   strength of your own resolutions, or present frame of your heart. The
   Ephraimites took it ill that Gideon would go to war, and not call them
   into the field when they went out against the enemy, Judges viii. 1.
   Oh, may not God much more take it ill that we will go forth to grapple
   with the devil and temptations, and go about any business in our own
   strength? Therefore, still a sense of our weakness must be upon us,
   that we may do all in the name of the Lord Jesus;' that is, by help and
   assistance from him, Col. iii. 17.

   [4.] When we boast of our courage before we are called to a trial. They
   that crack in their quarters do not always do most valiantly in the
   field. Peter's boast, Though all men should leave thee, yet will not
   I,' came to very little; and you know the story of Mr Saunders in the
   Book of Martyrs. Let not him that puts on his harness boast as he that
   puts it off.' A temptation will show us how little service that grace
   will do us which we are proud of, and boast of.

   2. To cure carnal confidence, remember your work and your impediments.
   (1.) Consider your work. A full view of duty will check our rash
   presumptions. Can you deny yourselves, take up your cross, maintain and
   carry on a holy course to your life's end? And (2.) Remember your
   impediments. Partly from a naughty heart. You are to row against the
   stream of flesh and blood. Satan will be sure to trouble you, and will
   assault you again and again. Though he be never so fully foiled, he
   will not give over the combat: Luke iv. 13, he departed from Christ for
   a season.' He had a mind to try the other bout. And the world will be
   your let--many discouragements and snares from the love and fear of it:
   1 John v. 3, 4, He that loves God keeps his commandments, and his
   commandments are not grievous'; and presently he saith, And this is the
   victory that overcometh the world, even our faith;' implying there is
   no keeping the commandments without victory over the world. Now, can
   you do all these things in your own strength? The young man was forward
   in resolving to keep the commandments, but he went away sad, for he had
   great possessions, Mat. xix. 22. Therefore consider these things, that
   you may fly to the Lord Jesus.

   Doct. 3. Though we fly to God's help, yet sometimes God may withdraw
   and forsake us.

   Here I shall speak of the kinds of desertion, and then of the reasons.

   First, For the kinds, take these distinctions:--

   1. There is a real desertion and a seeming. Christ may be out of sight,
   and yet you not out of mind. When the dam is abroad for meat, the young
   brood in the nest are not forgotten nor forsaken. The child cries as if
   the mother was gone, but she is but hidden, or about other business:
   Isa. xlix. 14, 15, Sion said, The Lord hath forsaken me, and my God
   hath forgotten me.' In the misgivings of our hearts, we think God hath
   cast off all care and all thought of us. But God's affectionate answer
   showeth that all this was but a fond surmise: Can a woman forget her
   sucking-child?' &c. So Ps. xxxi. 22, I said in my haste, I am cut off
   before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my
   supplications when I cried unto thee.' We are never more in God's heart
   many times than when we think he hath quite cast us off. Surely when
   the heart is drawn after him he is not wholly gone. We often mistake
   God's dispensations. When he is preparing for us more ample relief, and
   emptying us of all carnal dependence, we judge that that is a
   forsaking; as Ps. xciv. 18, When I said, My foot slippeth, thy mercy, O
   Lord, held me up.' Sometimes in point of comfort we are at a loss, and
   filled with distractions and troubles, and all is that God may come in
   for our relief. So in point of grace: 2 Cor. xii. 10, When I am weak,
   then I am strong.' There is also a real desertion; for God grants his
   people are forsaken some times: Though I have forsaken you for a little
   moment,' Isa. liv. 7, 8, And Christ, that could not be mistaken,
   complaineth of it; and the saints feel it to their bitter cost.

   2. There is internal and external desertion. Internal is with respect
   to the withdrawings of the Spirit: Ps. li. 11, Take not thy Holy Spirit
   from me.' Now external desertion is in point of affliction, when God
   leaves us under sharp crosses in his wise providence. These must be
   distinguished; sometimes they are asunder, some times together. And
   when they are together, God may return as to our inward comfort and
   support, yet not for our deliverance: Ps. cxxxviii. 3, In the day when
   I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with strength in my
   soul.' David was in great straits, and God affords him soul-relief;
   that was all the answer he could get then; support and strength to bear
   the troubles, but not deliverance from the affliction. Sometimes the
   ebb of outward comfort doth make way for a greater tide and influx of
   inward comfort: 2 Cor. i. 5, As the sufferings of Christ abound in us,
   so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.' Cordials are for a
   fainting time. When children are sick and weakly, we treat them with
   the more indulgence. God may return, and may never less forsake us
   inwardly than when he doth forsake us outwardly: 2 Cor. iv. 16, Though
   our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.' God
   makes sickly bodies make way for the health of the soul, and an aching
   head for a better heart. When he seems to cast us off in point of our
   external condition, it is to draw us into a more inward communion with
   himself, that we might receive greater supplies of his grace.

   3. There is a desertion as to comfort, and a desertion as to grace. The
   children of God may sometimes lose the feelings of God's love: Ps.
   lxxvii. 1-3, My soul refused to be comforted; I remembered God, and was
   troubled; my spirit was overwhelmed.' Oh, what a word was that!
   Remembering of God revives the heart; but to think of God, and to think
   of his loss, that was his great trouble. Yet all this while God may
   hold communion in point of grace: Ps. lxxiii. 23, Nevertheless, I am
   continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand.' He had
   been under a conflict, lost his comfort, yet he acknowledgeth support;
   God held him in his right hand. Trouble and discomfort hath its use;
   want of comfort makes way many times for increase of grace; and
   therefore, though a man may be deserted as to comfort, yet he may have
   a greater influence of grace from God. How often doth it fall put thus
   with God's children, that their right is more confirmed to spiritual
   blessings when their sense is lost! Then they are more industrious and
   diligent to get a sense of God's love again. A summer's sun that is
   clouded yields more comfort and warmth to the earth than a winter's sun
   that shines brightest. These cloudy times have their use and their
   fruit; and Christians have the less of a happy part of communion with
   God, that they may have more holiness; and less of sweetness and
   sensible consolation, that they may have more grace.

   4. There is desertio correctiva et eruditiva--a desertion for
   correction, and a desertion for instruction. Sometimes the aim of it is
   merely for correction for former sin; it is a penal overclouding for
   our unkind and ungracious dealing with him. God may do it for sins;
   nay, many times for old sins long ago committed; he may charge them
   anew upon the conscience: Job xiii. 24, compared with ver. 26,
   Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?' Thou
   makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.' An old bruise may
   trouble us long after, upon every change of weather. Many that have
   grieved God's Spirit in their youth, after they have been converted,
   God will reckon with them about it in their age. A man will smart for
   his ungracious courses first or last. Sometimes it is merely for
   instruction; it instructs us chiefly to show us God's sovereignty, with
   the changeableness of the best comfort on this side heaven; to show us
   his sovereignty, that he will be free to go and come at his own
   pleasure. He will have his people know he is lord, and may do with his
   own as pleaseth him. The heavenly eradiations and outshinings of his
   love are not at our beck; God will dispense them according to his
   pleasure. A mariner hath no cause to murmur and quarrel with God
   because the wind bloweth out of the east when he desireth a westerly
   gale. Why? Because it is his wind, and he will dispose these things
   according to his pleasure. So the comfort and outshinings of his love
   are his, and he will take them and give them as he thinks good. Again,
   to show us the changeableness of the best comforts on this side heaven.
   When Christ hath been in the soul with a full and high influx of
   comfort, this doth not remain long with us; God may withdraw. Observe
   it, often after the highest enlargements there may be some forsaking.
   Cant. v. 1, there we read of a feast between Christ and his beloved: 1
   Come eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.' Here
   they are feasted with love; presently we read of desertion, the spouse
   waxeth lazy and drowsy, and Christ is gone; then she is forced to go up
   and down to find him. Paul had his raptures; then a messenger of Satan
   to buffet him. The same disciples that were conscious to Christ's
   transfiguration--Peter, James, and John, Mat. xvii.--the same disciples
   are chosen also to be conscious to his agonies: Mat. xxvi. 37, He took
   with him Peter, James, and John.' First they had a glimpse of his
   glory, then a sight of his bitter agonies and sufferings, Jeremiah in
   one line singing of praise, and in the next cursing the day of his
   birth, Jer. xx. 13, 14. After the most ravishing comforts may be a sad
   suspension. Jacob saw the face of God, and wrestled with him, but his
   thigh halted. There needs something to humble the creature after these
   experiences.

   5. Desertion is either felt or not felt. Not felt, and then it is more
   dangerous, and usually ends in some notable fall; as Hezekiah, 2 Chron.
   xxxii. 31. God left him, and he was not sensible, and then he runs into
   pride and vainglory, and draweth wrath upon him and his people. God's
   children, when they do not observe his comings and goings, they fall
   into mischief, it begins their woe. We do not observe what experiences
   we have of God, then we faint: we do not observe his goings, then that
   makes way for some scandal and imprudent and un seemly action, and that
   makes way for some bitter and sharp affliction. But if it be felt, it
   is the better provided against. If we do not murmur, but seek to God in
   Christ to get the loss made up, then it is better. Meek acknowledgments
   are better than complaining expostulations. It is a sign it works
   kindly.

   6. There is a total and a partial desertion. Those who are bent to obey
   God may for a while and in some degree be left to themselves. We cannot
   promise ourselves an utter immunity from desertion, but it is not
   total. We shall find, for his great name's sake The Lord will not
   forsake his people,' 1 Sam. xii. 22; and Heb. xiii. 5, I will never
   leave thee nor forsake thee.' Not utterly, yet in part they may be
   forsaken. Elijah was forsaken, but not as Ahab; Peter was forsaken in
   part, but not as Judas, that was utterly forsaken, until he was made a
   prey to the devil. So carnal professors are forsaken utterly until they
   are made a prey fit for the devil's tooth. David was forsaken to be
   humbled and bettered; but Saul was forsaken utterly to be destroyed.
   Saith Theophylact, God may forsake his people so as to shut out their
   prayers, Ps. lxxx. 4, so as to interrupt the peace and joy of their
   heart, to abate their strength; the spiritual life may be much at a
   stand, and so as sin may break out, and they fall foully; but not
   utterly forsaken. But one way or other God is present; present in light
   sometimes when he is not present in strength, when he manifests the
   evil of their present condition, so as to mourn under it; and present
   in awakening desires, though not in giving enjoyment. As long as there
   is any esteem of God, he is not yet gone; there is some light and love
   yet left, manifested by our desires of communion with him.

   7. There is a temporary desertion and an eternal desertion. One is
   spoken of, Isa. liv. 7, 8, For a small moment have I forsaken thee, but
   with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee.' God may for sake
   his servants for a little while: indeed they may have a long winter of
   it sometimes; as David lay for many months under his sin, until Nathan
   roused him; but this is but a moment to the eternity wherein God loves
   them. But the eternal forsaking is of the final impenitent, when God
   saith, Never see my face more, go ye cursed,' &c. Thus for the kinds.

   Secondly, The reasons of desertion.

   1. To correct us for our wantonness, and our unkind dealing with
   Christ. If we neglect him upon frivolous pretences, certainly he will
   be gone: Cant. v. 3, I have put off my coat, how shall I put it on?'
   See ver. 6, My beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone.' When we
   are not at God's call, he will not be at our beck. She that would not
   open to Christ, when she opened, Christ was gone.

   2. To acquaint us with our weakness. What feathers are we when the
   blast of a temptation is let loose upon us! God will show what we are
   by his withdrawing. God left Hezekiah, That he might try him, that he
   might know all that was in his heart,' 2 Chron. xxxii. 31. When Christ
   was asleep, the storm arose, and the ship was in danger. If God be gone
   but a little, or suspend his influence, we can not stand our ground.

   3. To subdue our carnal confidence: Ps. xxx. 6, 7, In my prosperity I
   said, I shall never be moved.' We fall asleep upon a carnal pillow,
   then God draws it away: Thou didst hide thy face and I was troubled.'
   The nurse lets the child get a knock, to make it more cautious. God
   withdraws, that we may learn more to depend upon him.

   4. To heighten our esteem of Christ, that love may be sharpened by
   absence. When once we feel the loss of it to our bitter cost, we will
   not part with him again upon easy terms. The spouse when she caught him
   would not let him go. Cant. iii. 2, 3, 4; then are we more tender to
   observe him in his motions.

   5. That by our own bitter experience we may learn how to value the
   sufferings of Christ, when we taste of the bitter cup of which he drank
   for us. Christians, you do not know what it was for Christ to cry out,
   My God, why hast thou forsaken me?' Mat. xxvii. 46, until we are
   sensible in our measure and degree of the like. He tasted of the hell
   of being forsaken, and we must pledge him in that cup first or last,
   that we may know what our Saviour endured for us; and what it is for a
   holy man to want the light of God's countenance, and those sensible
   consolations that he formerly had.

   6. To prevent evil to come, especially pride, that we might not be
   lifted up; and to entender our hearts to others: 2 Cor. i. 4, That we
   might comfort others with the comforts wherewith we were comforted of
   God.'

   Use 1. This informs us that we are not therefore cast out of the love
   of God because there may be some forsaking. Desertion is incident to
   the most heavenly spirits. Christ hath legitimated this condition, and
   made it consistent with grace. It is a disease this which follows the
   royal seed; David, Heman, Hezekiah, these were forsaken, yet were
   children of God. It is more incident to the godly than the wicked and
   carnal. The carnal may be under bondage; sometimes their peace may be
   troubled and disturbed; but this desertion properly is a disease
   incident to the godly, and none are so affected with it as they: they
   have a tender heart; when God is gone how are they troubled! They are
   very observant, and therefore we cannot say they are not godly because
   they are forsaken. But those that never felt the love of Christ, never
   knew what communion with God means, were never troubled with sin, have
   none of this affliction; bat this is incident to the richest and most
   heavenly spirit whom God hath taken into communion with himself.

   Use 2. For direction to the children of God.

   1. Observe God's comings and goings; see whether you be forsaken. When
   God hides himself from your prayers, when means have not such a lively
   influence, when you have a strong affection to obey, but not such help
   to bring it into act, and you begin to stumble, observe it; God is
   withdrawn, and many times seems to withdraw, to observe whether you
   will take notice of it. Christ made as if he would go further, but they
   constrained him to stay; so he makes as if he would be gone, to see if
   you will constrain him to tarry.

   2. Inquire after the reason: Ps. lxxvii. 6, I communed with mine own
   heart.' What then? My spirit made diligent search.' Ay! this is the
   time to make diligent search what it is divides between God and you.
   Though God doth it out of sovereignty and instruction sometimes, yet
   there is ever cause for creatures to humble themselves, and make
   diligent search what is the matter.

   3. Submit to the dispensation: murmuring doth but entangle you more;
   God will have us stoop to his sovereignty and wisdom before he hath
   done. A husband must be absent for necessary occasions; a frown is as
   necessary for a child as a smile. David refuseth not to be tried, only
   he prays, Lord, forsake me not utterly.' It is a fond child that will
   not let its parent go out of sight.

   4. Learn to trust in a withdrawing God, and depend upon him; to stay
   ourselves upon his name when we see no light, Isa. l. 10. Never leave
   until you find him. Look, as Esther would go into the king's presence
   when there was no golden sceptre held forth, so venture into God's
   presence when you have no smile and countenance from heaven; trust in a
   withdrawing God; nay, when wrath breaks out, when God killeth you: Job
   xiii. 15, Though he kill me, yet will I trust in him.' With such a holy
   obstinacy of faith should we follow God in this case.

   Doct. 4. When God seemeth to forsake us, and really doth so in part,
   yet we should pray that it be not an utter and total desertion.

   Isa. lxiv. 9, Be not wroth very sore, O Lord, neither remember iniquity
   for ever. Behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy people,' (1.) Do
   not despond; we are very apt to do so: Ps. lxxvii. 7-9, Will the Lord
   cast off for ever? will he be favourable no more? Is his mercy clean
   gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore? Hath God forgotten
   to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.'
   The worst kind of despondency is to lie in sin. To lie in the dirt,
   because we are fallen, is foolish obstinacy. (2.) Pray to God--(1st.)
   Acknowledging that we have deserved it; (2d.) By supplication. There is
   nothing which God hath promised to perform but we may ask it in prayer:
   Heb. xiii. 5, He hath said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.'
   If thou provest me, let me not miscarry; if thou exercisest me, let me
   not be cut off. Beg his returns. (3.) Give thanks that God is not
   wholly gone, as certainly he is not, as long as you are sensible of
   your loss, and have a tender heart left. Though he hath withdrawn the
   light of his countenance, yet he hath left the esteem of it, a thirst
   after God, and a desire of communion with himself. As long as there is
   any attraction left, you may find him by the smell of his ointments.

SERMON X.

   Wherewith shall a young man cleanse his way? By taking heed thereto
   according to thy word.--Ver. 9.

   IN the former part the Psalmist showeth that the word of God pointeth
   out the only true way to blessedness. Now, the main thing which the
   word enforceth is holiness. This is the way which we must take if we
   intend to come to our journey's end. This David applieth to the young
   man in the text, Wherewith shall a young man cleanse,' &c.

   In the words there is--(1.) A question asked; (2.) An answer given.

   In the question there is the person spoken of, a young man. And his
   work, wherewith shall he cleanse his way? Omnis quaestio supponit unum,
   et inquirit aliud. In this question there are several things supposed.

   1. That we are from the birth polluted with sin; for we must be
   cleansed. It is not, direct his way,' but cleanse his way.'

   2. That we should be very early and timeously sensible of this evil;
   for the question is propounded concerning the young man.

   3. That we should earnestly seek for a remedy how to dry up the issue
   of sin^that runneth upon us. All this is to be supposed.

   That which is inquired after is, what remedy there is against it? what
   course is to be taken? So that the sum of the question is this: How
   shall a man that is impure, and naturally defiled with sin, be made
   able, as soon as he cometh to the use of reason, to purge out that
   natural corruption, and live a holy and pure life to God? The answer
   given is, By taking heed thereto according to thy word.' Where two
   things are to be observed--(1.) The remedy; (2.) The manner how it is
   applied and made use of.

   1. The remedy is the word--by way of address to God, called thy word;
   because if God had not given direction about it, we should have been at
   an utter loss.

   2. The manner how it is applied and made use of, by taking heed
   thereto, &c., by studying and endeavouring a holy conformity to God's
   will.

   [1.] I begin with the question; for, as the careless world carrieth the
   matter, it seemeth very impertinent and ridiculous. What have youth and
   childhood to do with so serious a work? When old age hath snowed upon
   their heads, and the smart experience of more years in the world hath
   ripened them for so severe a discipline, then it is time to think of
   cleansing their way, or of entering upon a course of repentance and
   submission to God. For the present, Dandum est aliquid huic
   aetati--youth must be a little indulged; they will grow wiser as they
   grow more in years. Oh! no; God demandeth his right as soon as we are
   capable to understand it. And it concerneth every one, as soon as he
   cometh to the use of reason, presently to mind his work, both in regard
   of God and himself.

   (1.) In regard of God, that he may not be kept out of his right too
   long: Eccles. xii. 1, Remember thy creator in the days of thy youth.'
   He is our creator; we have nothing but what he gave us, and that for
   his own use and service. And therefore the vessel should be cleansed as
   soon as may be, that it may be fit for the master's use.' It is a kind
   of spiritual restitution for the neglects of childhood and the
   forgetfulness of infancy, when we were not in a capacity to know our
   creator, much less to serve him. And therefore, as soon as we come to
   the use of reason, we should restore his right with advantage.

   (2.) In regard of himself. The first seasoning of the vessel is very
   considerable: Prov. xxii. 6, Train up a child in the way in which he
   should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it.' When well
   principled and seasoned in youth, it sticketh by them, before sin and
   worldly lusts have gotten a deeper rooting. If Solomon's observation be
   true, a man's infancy and younger time is a notable presage what he
   will prove afterwards: Prov. xx. 11, Even a child is known by his
   doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right.' Much may be
   known by our young inclinations. But, alas! this is not full out the
   case. The vessel is seasoned already; but wherewith shall a young man
   cleanse his way?' which presupposeth a defilement. No infant is like a
   vessel that newly cometh out of the potter's shop, indifferent for good
   or bad infusions. The vessel is tainted already, and hath a smatch of
   the old man and the corruptions of the flesh: Ps. li. 5, Behold I was
   shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.' We came
   polluted into the world; our business is to stop the growth of sin. As
   a child walloweth in his filthiness, so we do all spiritually wallow in
   our blood: Ezek. xvi. 4, 5, As for thy nativity, in the day thou wast
   born, thou wert not washed in water, nor swaddled at all. No eye pitied
   thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but
   thou wast cast out into the open field, to the loathing of thy person
   in the day that thou wast born. And when I saw thee polluted in thy own
   blood, I said unto thee, when thou wast in thy blood, Live,' &c.
   Therefore the question is very savoury and profitable, Wherewith shall
   a young man,' &c.

   But why is the young man only specified?

   I answer--All men are concerned in this work. Old men are not left to
   themselves, nor wholly given over as hopeless; but youth need it most,
   being inclined to liberty and carnal pleasures, and most apt to be led
   aside from the right way by the motions of the flesh; and being
   headstrong in their passions, and self-willed, need to have their
   fervours abated by the cool and chill doctrines of repentance and
   conversion to God. And, therefore, though others be not excluded, the
   young man is expressly mentioned: unbroken colts need the stronger
   bits. The word is of use to all, but especially to youth, to bridle
   them, and reduce them to reason.

   [2.] The answer--By taking heed thereto according to thy word.' The
   word, as a remedy against natural uncleanness, is considerable two
   ways--as a rule, and as an instrument.

   (1.) As the only rule of that holiness which God will accept. All other
   ways are but bypaths, as good meaning, or the suggestions of a blind
   conscience, custom, example of others, our own desires, laws of men,
   superstitious observances, and apocryphal holiness. Nothing is holiness
   in God's account, how specious soever it be, unless it be according to
   the word. What doth the word do about all these as the rule? It showeth
   the only way of reconciliation with God, or being cleansed from the
   guilt of sin, and the only way of solid and true sanctification and
   subjection to God, which is our cleansing from the filthiness of sin.
   All religions aim at this--Ut anima sit subjecta Deo, et peccata [5] in
   se. No true peace without the word, nor no true holiness. The first is
   proved Jer. vi. 16, Thus saith the Lord, Stand ye in the ways and see,
   and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and
   ye shall find rest for your souls.' The second is proved John xvii. 17,
   Sanctify them through thy truth, thy word is truth.' So that a young
   man that is, like Hercules in bivio, to choose his path to true
   happiness, will never attain to true peace and sound satisfaction of
   conscience, nor to true grace or a hearty subjection to God, but by
   consulting with the word. No other rule and direction will serve the
   turn. (1.) It is the only rule to teach us how to obtain true peace of
   conscience. The whole world is become obnoxious to God, and held under
   the awe of divine justice. This bondage is natural, and the great
   inquiry is how his anger shall be appeased: Micah vi. 6, 7, Wherewith
   shall I come before the Lord, and bow myself before the high God? Shall
   I come before him with burnt-offerings, with calves of a year old? Will
   the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of
   rivers of oil? Shall I give my first-born for my transgression, the
   fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?' Now here is no tolerable
   satisfaction offered, no plaster for the wounds of conscience, no way
   to compromise and take up the controversy between us^and God; but by
   the propitiation which the gospel holdeth forth all this is effected.
   The Gentiles were at a loss, the Jews rested in the sacrifices, which
   yet could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to
   the conscience,' Heb. ix. 9; therefore they fled to barbarous and
   sinfully cruel customs, offering their first-born, &c. There was no
   course to recover men from their entanglements and perplexities of
   soul, how to pacify God for sin, but they were still left in a floating
   uncertainty, till God revealed himself as reconciling the world to
   himself in Christ. Now, no doctrine doth propound the way of
   reconciliation with God, and redemption from those fears of his angry
   justice which are so natural to us, with such rational advantages, and
   claimeth such a just title to human belief, as the doctrine of the
   gospel. Oh! then, if the young man would cleanse his conscience, and
   quiet and calm his own spirit, he must of necessity take up with the
   word as his sure direction in the case. Look abroad, where will you
   find rest for your souls in this business of atonement and
   reconciliation with God? What strange horrible fruits and effects have
   men's contrivances on this account produced? What have they not
   invented, what have they not done, what not suffered upon this account?
   and yet continued in dread and bondage all their days. Now, what a
   glorious soul-appeasing light doth the doctrine of satisfaction and
   atonement by the blood of Christ the Son of God cause to break in upon
   the hearts of men! The testimony of blood in the conscience is one of
   the witnesses the believer hath in himself: 1 John v. 8, And there are
   three that bear witness on earth, the spirit, the water, and the
   blood;' and ver. 10, He that believeth on the Son of God hath the
   witness in himself.' (2.) It is the only rule of true holiness. Never
   was it stated and brought to such a pitch as it is in the scriptures,
   nor enforced by such arguments as are found there; it requireth such a
   holiness as standeth in conformity to God, and is determined by his
   will. Now it is but reason that he that is the Supreme Being should be
   the rule of all the rest. It is a holiness of another rate than the
   blind heart could find out; not an external devotion, nor a civil
   course, but such as transformeth the heart and subdueth it to the will
   of God, Rom. ii. 15. If a man would attain to the highest exactness
   that a rational creature is capable of, not to moral virtue only, but a
   true genuine respect to God and man, he must regard and love the law of
   God that is pure. A man that would be holy had need of an exact rule,
   for to be sure his practice will come short of his rule; and therefore,
   if the rule itself be short, there will no due provision be made for
   respects to God or man. But now this is a rule that reacheth not only
   to the way, but the thoughts; that converteth the soul: Ps. xix. 7, The
   law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.' Take the fairest
   draughts of that moral perfection which yet is of human recommendation,
   and you will find it defective and maimed in some parts, either as to
   God or men. It is inferioris hemisphaerii, as not reaching to the full
   subjection of the soul to God. There is some dead fly in their box of
   ointment, either for manner or end.

   (2.) The word is considerable as an instrument which God maketh use of
   to cleanse the heart of man. It will not be amiss a little to show the
   instrumentality of the word to this blessed end and purpose. It is the
   glass that discovereth sin, and the water that washeth it away. (1.) It
   is the glass wherein to see our corruption. The first step to the cure
   is a knowledge of the disease; it is a glass wherein to Bee our natural
   face: James i. 23, For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer,
   he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass,' &c. In
   the word we see God's image and our own. It is the copy of God's
   holiness, and the representation of our natural faces, Rom. vii. 9.
   What fond conceits have we of our own spiritual beauty! but there we
   may see the leprous spots that are upon us. (2.) It sets us a-work to
   see it purged; it is the water to wash it out. The word of command
   presseth the duty; it is indispensably required. What doth every
   command sound in our ears but Wash you, make you clean.'? This is
   indispensably required: 1 John iii. 3, And every man that hath this
   hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure;' and Heb. xii. 14,
   Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see
   the Lord.' Some things God may dispense with, but this is never
   dispensed with. Many things are ornamental that are not absolutely
   necessary, as wealth, riches: Wisdom with an inheritance is good;' so
   learning. Many have gone to heaven that were never learned, but never
   any without holiness. (3.) The word of promise encourageth it: 2 Cor.
   vii. 1, Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse
   ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting
   holiness in the fear of God;' and 2 Peter i. 4, Whereby are given unto
   us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these you might be
   partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is
   in the world through lust.' God might have required it upon the account
   of his sovereignty, we being his creatures, especially this being the
   perfection of our natures, and rather a privilege than a burden; but
   God would not rule us with a rod of iron, but deal with rational
   creatures rationally, by promises and threatenings. On the one side he
   telleth us of a pit without a bottom: on the other, of blessed and
   glorious promises, things which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard of,
   neither have entered into the heart of man to conceive.' Therefore the
   word hath a notable instrumentality that way.

   (3.) The doctrine of the scripture holds out the remedy and means of
   cleansing--Christ's blood; which is not only an argument or motive to
   move us to it. So it is urged 1 Peter i. 8, Whom having not seen, ye
   love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice
   with joy unspeakable,' &c. It presseth holiness upon this argument.
   Why? God hath been at great cost to bring it about, therefore we must
   not content ourselves with some smooth morality, which might have been
   whether Christ had been, yea or nay. Again, the word propounds it as a
   purchase, whereby grace is procured for us; so it is said, 1 John i. 7,
   He hath purchased the Spirit to bless us, and turn us from our sins.
   And it exciteth faith to apply and improve this remedy, and so
   conveyeth the power of God into the soul: Acts xv. 9, Purifying their
   hearts by faith.'

   2. The manner how the word is applied and made use of, If he take heed
   thereunto according to thy word.' This implieth a studying of the word,
   and the tendency and importance of it, which is necessary if the young
   man would have benefit by it. David calleth the statutes of God the men
   of his counsel. Young men that are taken with other books, if they
   neglect the word of God--that book that should do the cure upon the
   heart and mind--they are, with all their knowledge, miserable: Ps. i.
   2, His delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he
   meditate day and night.' If men would grow wise to salvation, and get
   any skill in the practice of godliness, they must be much in this
   blessed book of God, which is given us for direction: 1 John ii. 14, I
   have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word
   of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.' It is not
   a slight acquaintance with the word that will make a young man so
   successful as to defeat the temptations of Satan, and be too hard for
   his own lust; it is not a little notional irradiation, but to have the
   word dwell in you, and abide in you richly. The way to destroy ill
   weeds is to plant good herbs that are contrary. We suck in carnal
   principles with our milk, and therefore we are said to speak lies from
   the womb.' A kind of a riddle; before we are able to speak, we speak
   lies--namely, as we are prone to error and all manner of carnal fancies
   by the natural temper and frame of our hearts, Isa. lviii. 2; and
   therefore, from our very tender and infant-age we should be acquainted
   with the word of God: 2 Tim. iii. 15, And that from a child thou hast
   known the Holy Scriptures.' It may be children, by reading the word,
   get nothing but a little memorative knowledge, but yet it is good to
   plant the field of the memory; in time they will soak into the judgment
   and conscience, and thence into the heart and affections.

   3. It implieth a care and watchfulness over our hearts and ways, that
   our will and actions be conformed to the word. This must be the young
   man's daily prayer and care, that there be a conformity between his
   will and the word, that he may be a walking Bible, Christ's living
   epistle, copy out the word in his life, that the truths of it may
   appeal plainly in his conversation.

   All that I have said issueth itself into three points:--

   1. That the great duty of youth, as soon as they come to the full use
   of reason, is to inquire and study how they may cleanse their hearts
   and ways from sin.

   2. That the word of God is the only rule sufficient and effectual to
   accomplish this work.

   3. If we would have this efficacy, there is required much care and
   watchfulness, that we come to the direction of the word in every
   tittle; not a loose and inattentive reflection upon the word, careless
   inconsiderateness, but a taking heed thereunto.

   Now, why in youth, and as soon as we come to the use of reason, we
   should mind the work of cleansing our way?

   1. Consider how reasonable this is. It is fit that God should have our
   first and our best. It is fit he should have our first, because he
   minded us before we were born. His love to us is an eternal and an
   everlasting love; and shall we put off God to old age? shall we thrust
   him into a corner? Surely God, that loved us so early, it is but reason
   he should have our first, and also our best; for we have all from him.
   Under the law the first-fruits were God's, to show the first and best
   was his portion. All the sacrifices that were offered to him, they were
   in their strength, and young: Lev. ii. 14, And if thou offer a
   meat-offering of thy first-fruits unto the Lord, thou shalt offer for
   the meat-offering of thy first-fruits green ears of corn dried by the
   fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.' God would not stay till
   ripened. God will not be long kept out of his portion. Youth is our
   best time. Mal. i. 13, when they brought a weak and sickly offering,
   Should I accept this of your hand? saith the Lord.' The health,
   strength, quickness of spirit, and vigour is in youth. Shall our health
   and strength be for the devil's use, and shall we put off God with the
   dregs of time? Shall Satan feast upon the flower of our youth and fresh
   time, and God only have the scraps and fragments of the devil's table?
   When wit is dulled, the ears heavy, the body weak, and affections are
   spent, is this a fit present for God?

   2. Consider the necessity of it. (1.) Because of the heat of youth, the
   passions and lusts are very strong: 2 Tim. ii. 22, Fly also youthful
   lusts.' Men are most incident in that age to pride and self-conceit, to
   strong affections, inordinate and excessive love of liberty: 1 Tim.
   iii. 6, Not a novice, lest, being lifted up with pride, he fall into
   the condemnation of the devil.' A man may make tame fierce creatures,
   lions and tigers; and the fury of youth needs to be tempered and
   bridled by the word. It is much for the glory of grace that this heat
   and violence is broken when the subject is least of all disposed and
   prepared. (2.) Because none are tempted so much as they. Children
   cannot be serviceable to the devil, and old men are spent, and have
   chosen their ways; but youths, who have a sharpness of understanding,
   and the stoutest and most stirring spirits, the devil loveth to make
   use of such: 1 John ii. 13, I write unto you, young men, because ye
   have overcome the wicked one.' They are most assaulted; but it is for
   the honour of grace when they overcome, when their fervency and
   strength is employed, not in satisfying lusts, but in the service of
   God and fighting against Satan. Therefore it is very needful they
   should be seasoned with the word betimes.

   3. Consider the many inconveniencies that will follow if they do not
   presently mind this work. (1.) Death is uncertain, and therefore such a
   weighty business as this will brook no delay. God doth not always give
   warning. Nadab and Abihu, two rash and inconsiderate young men, were
   taken away in their sins; and the bears out of the forest devoured the
   children that mocked the prophet. The danger being so great, as soon as
   we are sensible of it, we should flee from it. When children come to
   the fulness of reason, they stand upon their own bottom; before, they
   are reckoned to their parents. Oh, woe be to you if you die in your
   sins! Certainly as soon as a man is upon his own personal account, he
   should look to himself, lest God cut him off before he hath made his
   peace with him. (2.) Sin groweth stronger by custom, and more rooted;
   it gathereth strength by every act. A brand that hath been in the fire
   is more apt to take fire again. A man in a dropsy, the more he drinks,
   the more his thirst increaseth. Every act lesseneth fear and
   strengthened inclination: Jer. xiii. 27, Woe unto thee, Jerusalem! wilt
   thou not be made clean? when shall it once be?' A twig is easily bowed,
   but when it grows into a tree it is more troublesome and unpliable. A
   tree newly set may be transplanted, but when long rooted, not so
   easily. The man that was possessed of a devil from his childhood, how
   hardly is he cured! Mark ix. 29. (3.) Justice is provoked the longer,
   and that will be a grief to you first or last. If ever we be brought
   home to God, it will cost us many a bitter tear; not only at first
   conversion: Jer. xxxi. 18, I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning
   himself thus: Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised,' &c., but
   afterwards, David, though he began with God betimes, Ps. xxv. 7, yet
   prays, Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgression;' and
   Job xiii. 26, For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me
   to possess the iniquities of my youth.' Old bruises may trouble us long
   after, upon every change of weather, and new afflictions revive the
   sense of old sins; they may stick by us. We think tricks of youth are
   not to be stood upon: you may have a bitter sense of them to your dying
   day. (4.) You will every day grow more useless to God: the exercise of
   religion dependeth much on the vigour of affections. Again, it is very
   profitable; it brings a great deal of honour to God to begin with him
   betimes. All time is little enough to declare your respects to God. And
   it is honourable for you. Seniority in grace is a preferment: they were
   in Christ before me,' saith Paul. An old disciple is a title of honour.
   To grow grey in Christ's service, and to know him long, it maketh the
   work of grace more easy. The dedication of the first-fruits sanctified
   the whole lump: Lam. iii. 27, It is good for a man that he bear the
   yoke in his youth,' to be inured to strictness betimes. Dispositions
   impressed in youth increase with us. Again, it will be very comfortable
   when the miseries of old age come upon you. As the ant provideth in
   summer for winter, so should we provide for age. Now what a sweet
   comfort will it be, when we are taken off from service, that while we
   had any strength and affections, God had the use of them! Then our age
   will be a good old age.

   Use 1 is for lamentation that so few youths take to the ways of God. No
   age doth despise the word so much as this, which hath most need of it.
   It is a rare thing to find a Joseph, or a Samuel, or a Josiah,. that
   seek God betimes. Go the universities, and you will find that those
   that should be as Nazarites consecrated to God, live as those that have
   vowed and consecrated themselves to Satan: Amos ii. 11, And I raised up
   of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites,' &c.
   The sons of the prophets in their youth were bred for a more strict
   discipline in their holy calling, separated from worldly delights, to
   be a stock of a succeeding ministry. But, alas I they spend their time
   in vanity, bringing nothing thence but the sins of the place, and
   vainly following the sinful customs of the country. How few regard the
   education of their youth in knowledge or religious practice! Families
   are societies to be sanctified to God, as well as churches. The
   governors of them have as truly a charge of souls as the pastors of
   churches. They offer their children to God in baptism, but educate and
   bring them up for the world and the flesh. They be wail any natural
   defect in them, if their children have a stammering tongue, a deaf ear,
   or a withered leg; but not want of grace. We have a prejudice, and
   think they are too young to be wrought upon; but God's word can break
   in with weight and power on young ones: Luke xi. 1, One of his
   disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught
   his disciples;' and Mat. xxi. 15, 16, When the chief priests and
   scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying
   in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore
   displeased, and said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus
   said unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouths of babes and
   sucklings thou hast perfected praise?' They learned it of their
   parents: Mat. xxi. 9, And the multitudes that went before, and that
   followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David.' We should often
   be infusing good principles in youth. Corruption of youth is one of the
   saddest symptoms of approaching judgment.

   Use 2 is exhortation to young ones. You that are to begin your course,
   begin with God: you have no experience, yet you have a rule; you have
   mighty lusts, but a stronger spirit. No age is excluded from the
   promise of the Spirit: Joel ii. 28, 29, And it shall come to pass
   afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons
   and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams,
   your young men shall see visions; and also upon the servants and upon
   the handmaids in those days will I pour out my Spirit.' Of John the
   Baptist it is said, Luke i. 15, He shall be filled with the Holy Ghost
   even from his mother's womb;' and Mark x. 14, Suffer little children to
   come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of God.'
   There is power to enlighten you, notwithstanding all your prejudices;
   to subdue your lusts, notwithstanding the power of corruptions: 1 John
   ii. 13, 14, I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the
   wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known
   the Father,' etc.; and see Gen. xxxix. 9. It will be a great comfort to
   you when you die that your great work is over. Oh, what a sad thing is
   it that, when the body is going to the grave, the soul hath not yet
   learned to converse with God! Hosea viii. 12, I have written to them
   the great things of my law; but they were counted a strange thing.' God
   hath written an epistle to us, and we will not read it nor consult with
   it; are wholly strangers to it. But now, when acquainted with God, it
   will not be so irksome to go to him.

SERMON XI.

   With my whole heart have I sought thee: let me not wander from thy
   commandments.--Ver. 10.

   THE Psalmist had in the former verse directed the young man to
   diligence^and attention unto the word; but the word doth nothing unless
   we join prayer; and therefore now he gives an example in his own
   person. Having spoken of the power of the word to cleanse the way, now
   saith he, With my whole heart,' &c.

   Here take notice--

   1. Of David's argument, with my whole heart have I sought thee.

   2. His request, O let me not wander from thy commandments.

   First, For David's argument, I have sought thee with my whole heart.'
   He pleadeth his own sincerity. I showed you largely what it is to seek
   God, and that with the whole heart, in the second verse. I shall not
   repeat anything; only, that I may not dismiss this clause without some
   note, observe, first, that it is the duty and practice of God's
   children to seek him.

   You have David's instance in the text and elsewhere. It is their
   general character: Ps. xxiv. 6, This is the generation of them that
   seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah.' God's children are a
   generation of seekers. They find hereafter, but now they seek. Their
   great business is to be seeking after God, more ample and full
   communion with him.

   Seeking of God implies three things:--

   1. There is a more general seeking of God, for relief of our sin and
   misery by nature.

   2. More particular, upon special occasions.

   3. There is a constant seeking of God in the use of his ordinances.

   1. There is a more general seeking of God, for relief of our sinful and
   wretched condition by nature. Adam, when a sinner, ran away from God;
   and therefore all our business is now to seek him, that we may find him
   again in Christ Jesus. The general address that is made to God for
   pardon and reconciliation, it is often called a seeking of God in
   scripture; so it is taken Isa. lv. 6, Seek ye the Lord while he may be
   found; call upon him while he is near;' that is, get into favour with
   God before it be too late. So Amos v. 6, Seek the Lord, and ye shall
   live.' This notes our general address for pardon and reconciliation.

   2. There is a more particular seeking of God; that notes our addresses
   to God either in our exigencies and straits, or in all our business and
   employment.

   [1.] In our exigencies and straits. And so we are said to seek God when
   in doubts we seek his direction, James i. 5; when in weakness we seek
   strength; in sickness, health; in troubles, comfort. Asa is blamed that
   he sought not to the Lord, but to the physicians.' Paul's messenger of
   Satan drives him to the throne of grace: 2 Cor. xii. 8, For this I
   sought the Lord thrice.' He would knock again and again, to see what
   answers he could get from God.

   [2.] In all our businesses and affairs God must be sought unto, and we
   must ask his leave, his counsel, and his blessing. Pagans, before the
   awe of religion was extinguished, would begin with their gods in every
   weighty enterprise. A Jove principium was an honest heathen principle.
   Laban consults with his teraphim; Balak sends for Balaam; they had
   their oracles that they would resort to. So far as any nation was
   touched with a sense of a divine power, they would never venture upon
   anything without consulting with their gods. And it is enjoined as a
   piece of religious good manners to own God upon all occasions: Prov.
   iii. 5, In all thy ways acknowledge him.' It is an acknowledgment of
   God, an owning him as a God, that we would be asking his leave,
   counsel, and blessing. His leave must be asked, though the thing be
   never so lawful and easy. We are taught every day to ask our daily
   bread, though we have it by us, that we may not, like thieves and
   robbers, use his goods without his leave. So for his counsel; he is
   sure to miscarry that makes his bosom his oracle, his wit his
   counsellor. It is a high piece of spiritual idolatry to lean upon our
   own understanding, and think to carry even the ordinary affairs of any
   day without asking counsel from God. And then his blessing. God is not
   an idle spectator, he disposeth of all events, and giveth the blessing:
   Jer. x. 23, The way of man is not in himself; it is not in man that
   walketh to direct his steps;' that is, as to any happy issue. God doth
   the more stand upon his right that he may the oftener hear from us, and
   that we may have many occasions to bring us to the throne of grace. Now
   this is the constant practice of God's children. David always ran to
   the oracle or the ephod when he had any business to do: 1 Sam. xxiii.,
   Shall I do thus and thus, or shall I not? Jacob in his journey would
   neither go to Laban, nor come from him, without a warrant. Jehoshaphat
   in the business of Ramoth-Gilead would not stir a foot until he had
   counsel from God; he sends not only to the captain of the host, but to
   the prophet of the Lord: Inquire, I pray thee, of the Lord to day,' 1
   Kings xxii. 2; Judges i. 1, ii. 28.

   I have spoken this to show why the children of God are called the
   generation of them that seek him.

   3. The third thing that may be called seeking of God is our observance
   of him in the use of his ordinances. It is one thing to serve God,
   another thing to seek God; one thing to make God the object, another
   thing the end of our worship. To seek God only in our necessity, and
   not to seek God in his ordinances, argueth a base spirit. Christians,.
   our losing God in Adam, that makes us seek him in a way of
   reconciliation. Our want of God in straits, and in the course of our
   affairs, maketh us seek him by way of supply. But now our duty to God,
   and love to him, should make us seek him in his ordinances by way of
   communion; and in this sense seeking God is often spoken of in
   scripture: Ps. xxii. 26, They shall praise the Lord that seek him;'
   that is, that wait upon him, and maintain communion with him in the
   means of grace.

   Well, then, let us be more in seeking of God. If we would find him in
   heaven, we must seek him on earth: Heb. xi. 6, He is a rewarder of them
   that diligently seek him.' They that seek his favour, that often resort
   to him, carry on a constant communion with him; those that are waiting
   for his power and presence in his ordinances, these are the men God
   will own. We are not fit to receive so great a blessing as God's favour
   if we will not look after it with diligence.

   Secondly, Observe, those that seek God aright, must seek him with their
   whole heart.

   But how is that? Besides what hath already been spoken of it in the
   second use, it noteth three things--

   1: Sincerity of aims.

   2. Integrity of parts.

   3. Uniformity of endeavours.

   1. Sincerity of aims. Many pretend to seek God, but indeed they do but
   seek themselves. As those that followed Christ for the loaves, that
   take up religion upon base and carnal respects: John vi. 26, Verily I
   say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because
   ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.' There was much outward
   diligence, but a false heart lurking under it; their belly drove them
   to him. Of all by-ends this is the worst and basest: Vix diligitur
   Jesus propter Jesum.--Jesus Christ is scarce loved for Jesus' sake.
   Yet, further, those that prayed to God for corn, wine, and oil, and did
   not seek his favour and grace in the first place, see what the Lord
   saith of them: Hosea vii. 14, They have not cried unto me with their
   heart, when they howled upon their beds.' They did seek God, but yet it
   is counted howling. They only minded the supply of outward wants; and
   made prayer merely to be an act of carnal self-love. And then it is but
   howling, such a noise as a dog or a beast would make when he wants his
   food. Christians, no doubt they were instant, there was a world of
   earnestness, they were affected when the stroke was upon them, and
   seriously desired to get rid of it, but they have not cried to me with
   their whole heart.' It was but such a sense of pain and want as the
   beasts have. If there be anything sought from God more than God, or not
   for God, we do not seek him with the whole heart, but only for other
   uses.

   2. It notes integrity of parts. We read in scripture of loving God, not
   only with the heart, but with the whole heart;' and of believing, not
   only with the heart, Rom. x. 10, but of believing with the whole
   heart,' Acts viii. 37; because seeking of God is but a metaphorical
   term, by which faith is expressed; therefore let us see what it is to
   believe with the whole heart. The doctrine of the gospel is not only
   true, to work upon the understanding, but it is good, so as to move and
   draw the will: 1 Tim. i. 15, This is a faithful saying, and worthy of
   all acceptation,' &c. Not only a faithful saying'--that is, a true
   doctrine--that Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners,' but
   it is worthy of all acceptation.' It is an excellent doctrine to ravish
   the will. Now, observe what a great deal of difference there is between
   men in believing. Some that hear the gospel, and have only a literal
   knowledge of it, so as to be able to talk of it, so as to understand
   the words and syllables, to know what it means; they may have some
   clearness of understanding this way, but there is not a sound assent.
   There are others affected so with the gospel, as by the common
   influence of the Spirit they may assent to the truths delivered
   concerning God and Christ, and salvation by him, yet do not give it
   entertainment in their hearts. These may be said to seek God, but not
   with the whole heart. A speculative, naked, and cold assent they may
   have, but that is not enough. It is not enough to see food that is
   whole some, but you must eat it. Nor is it enough to understand the
   gospel, and believe that it is true, but we must embrace it; it must be
   accepted, else we do not believe with the whole heart. The word is
   propounded to man as true. Now, the truth made known may cause a
   speculative assent. This may draw profession after it; and this we call
   historical faith, because we are no more affected with the gospel than
   with an ordinary history which we read and believe. The word is
   propounded again as good, to move and excite the will. Now, there is a
   twofold good--the good of happiness, and the good of holiness. The good
   of happiness, that which is profitable and sweet. Then there is the
   good of holiness. Now, there are many that look upon the gospel as good
   and profitable, because it offereth pardon and eternal life; such
   comfort to the conscience, and such good to our whole souls. We may be
   affected with it as a good doctrine. Naturally, man hath not only a
   sense of religion, but he hath a hunger after immortality and
   everlasting blessedness. Therefore, since the gospel doth so clearly
   promote happiness, it may be greedily catched hold of by those whose
   hearts are affected, while they look upon it under these notions; and
   they may be so far affected that they may for a while not only profess
   it out of danger, but when some danger doth arise they may defend their
   opinions with some care. Yet this is not with all the heart. Why? As
   soon as any great danger doth arise, out of which there is no escape,
   as gibbets, fires, racks, ignominy, and utter loss--as soon as
   persecution arose, saith Christ, all this ardour and heat of spirit
   which they did formerly seem to have, comes to nothing. What is the
   reason it vanisheth? Because they receive the gospel rather upon those
   notions of interest and profit, than of duty and holiness; and the
   impression of the profitableness of the gospel, as a doctrine of
   happiness, was not so deeply rooted in them, not so durable, that the
   hope of the future good would be prevalent over the fear of present
   evil and danger. There may be some desires of heaven in a carnal
   breast, but they are easily blotted out by worldly temptations; but the
   true desires of holiness are lasting, and will prevail over our lusts.

   3. Believing with all the heart implies uniformity of endeavours.
   Oftentimes the soul may be strongly moved and affected for the present,
   and carried out to the gospel under the notion of holiness; but it is
   but the lighter part of the soul that is so moved, not the whole heart,
   therefore it is not durable. The people meant as they spake when they
   were willing to come under the obedience of the word. God gives them
   that testimony: The people have well said; but oh! that there were such
   a heart in them,' Deut. v. 28, 29. They may receive it, and may seem
   affected with it, and have a sense of reformation; but, saith the
   evangelist, Luke viii. 14, It brings no fruit to perfection.' It was
   not so deeply rooted as to prevail strongly over their carnal
   distempers. And, therefore, here comes in another sort of men, that are
   affected with the word as a holy doctrine. They may have a liking to
   the holiness of it, and have some consolation thereupon; they have
   their beginnings, and some good offers towards sanctification; but it
   brings nothing to perfection. They may have such a hope of heaven as
   that they may be said to taste the powers of the world to come,' Heb.
   vi. 5, 6; yet because it is not deeply rooted in the heart, and only
   begets some raw motions, and moves the lighter part of the soul, and
   doth not show itself in a uniform course of obedience, therefore it is
   not with all the heart. It may be it was but for a time, or cast in
   upon some eminent trouble. Therefore that is only believing, and
   seeking God with all the heart, when the doctrine of life is so
   acknowledged to be true, good, and holy, as to be closed with upon that
   account; not only because of its suitableness to our eternal good and
   interest, but as it is a rule of our duty. And then it enters upon the
   heart when every faculty of it is subdued to God. It is not some
   colouring of the outside, but a deep dye when it soaks into the whole
   soul, and subdues the affections to God, which is manifested by a
   uniform course of obedience. Now David urgeth this to God as an
   argument, I have sought thee with my whole heart.' Hence observe--

   Doct. We may mention the good which is wrought in us, and urge it to
   God in prayer.

   It is a useful case. How may we mention our own gracious
   qualifications, and the good that is wrought in us?

   Negatively--1. Not by way of boasting. There is no such thing here; no
   presumptuous boasting of his own perfections; for it was accompanied
   with a deep sense of his weakness, wandering, and straggling condition;
   he acknowledgeth his infirmities. There is no such thing allowed as
   boasting. The apostle's argument is convincing, Why boastest thou? What
   have we that we have not received?' If we can boast of anything, it is
   that we are most in debt, that we have received more: 1 Cor. i. 31, we
   must glory in the Lord.'

   2. Not pleading of merit, as if he had deserved anything of God. So the
   Pharisee speaks of his good works, Luke xviii. 11. It is not to such a
   purpose as if we could challenge a reward as a due debt upon any good
   that we have done.

   But positively--How then may we make mention of our qualifications?

   1. We may mention what is wrought in us for God's glory. Surely,
   however we humble ourselves, we must not belie his bounty. To be always
   complaining of spiritual evils, it doth not argue a good temper of
   soul: Ps. cxvi. 7, Return to thy rest, my soul, for the Lord hath dealt
   bountifully with thee.' We may own the Lord's bounty, and take notice
   what good we have done to the glory of his grace: Not I, but the grace
   of God which was with me,' 1 Cor. xv. 10.

   2. We may mention it to our own comfort. Thus Paul, 2 Cor. i. 12. Jesus
   Christ is our rejoicing, but in one sense this is also our rejoicing,
   the testimony of our conscience.' Wherefore is grace given us, but for
   the furtherance of our comfort? To bear false witness against ourselves
   is naught. Though the duties of the first table neither begin nor end
   in us, yet the whole law of charity begins at home.

   3. For our own vindication. Thus Hezekiah: Isa. xxxviii. 3, Remember, O
   Lord, how I have walked before thee with a perfect heart.' This was his
   plea; but I suppose it was not before God as a judge, but before God as
   a witness. He called God to witness that he had walked before him with
   a perfect heart. He was slandered by Rabshakeh. They thought, when he
   broke down the altars of Baal and cut down their groves, that he had
   cut down the altars of the God of Israel; therefore, saith Rabshakeh,
   speaking to the humour and discontent of the people--and we must look
   upon it as a politic insinuation--Is not this he whose high places and
   whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away and demolished?' 2 Kings xviii.
   22. Now, saith Hezekiah, I have walked before thee with an upright
   heart.' Many a good magistrate is often put upon such pleas for God's
   honour, in things distasteful to the popularity.

   4. What God hath wrought in us may be urged as an argument in prayer to
   obtain further grace many ways. Partly because God loves to crown his
   own mercies, and make one to be a step to another. We are endeared to
   God by his own mercies; he is very tender and choice of them. In whom
   he hath begun a good work he will perfect it: Zech. iii. 2, Is not this
   a brand plucked out of the fire?' What I shall all my former mercies be
   in vain? It is God's own argument, and he takes it well when his people
   urgeth it. In many cases, Deus donando debet--by giving one mercy, he
   makes himself a debtor to give another. Plutarch gives us a story of
   the Rhodians, when they came to sue to the Romans for help, that one
   urged what good turns they had done to the Romans; but the people urged
   what good turns the Romans did to them, and they obtained relief. Such
   a plea is accept able and honourable to God, when we urge what God hath
   done for us. And partly because sincerity, by the consent of all, hath
   the full room of an evidence and gospel-plea in the court of
   justification. When the business is how a sinner shall be accepted with
   God, for a law-plea we can only plead the merits of Christ and God's
   mercy; there all we have and can do is but dung and dross, Phil. iii.
   8, 9, as to an acquittance from sin. But as to our acquittance from
   hypocrisy, as to the plea of a gospel-evidence, we may produce our
   sincerity and the fruits of our obedience, to show our title is good as
   the matter is ordered by the Lord's grace, that we have the
   gospel-title. To all the other our title is by the righteousness of
   Christ, but the evidence of our title is sincere walking.

   Secondly, Let us come to David's request, Let me not wander from thy
   commandments.' It may be translated, Make me not to err;' that is, by
   the suspending of thy grace;' for that will necessarily follow. The
   Septuagint reads, Do not repel from thy commandments.' God seems to
   repel and cast off those that he doth not assist with his grace. Here
   David saith, I have sought thee.' Observe the mischief that a heart
   which truly seeketh God desireth to fly from--sin, or wandering from
   the path of obedience. There is a communion with God, but in the way of
   his commandments; therefore they do not desire establishment of their
   interest and happiness only, but of God's glory, that they might not
   wander. Hence observe--

   Doct. 1. The more experience men have of the ways of God, the more
   sensible will they be of their readiness to wander.

   David, a man of so much experience, that sought God with his whole
   heart, Lord, let me not wander.' What is the reason?

   1. Because they have a larger sense of duty.

   2. A more tender sense of dangers and difficulties that do attend them.

   First, They have a larger sense of duty to God. At first, while we are
   carnal, we take up duty by the lump, and by the visible bulk of it; we
   look only to ergon nomou, the work of the law.' Rom. ii. 15, and to
   avoid gross sins, or perform outward acts of worship. Oh! if I do sin,
   I am no adulterer, no extortioner, Luke xviii. 11. We think then it is
   well. But when we begin to have grace wrought in our heart, then we
   begin to serve God in the spirit, Phil. iii. 3: And my God, whom I
   serve with my spirit.' Rom. i. 9, then we begin to look after the
   regulation of the inner man, and subduing of the soul to God; and we
   cannot be contented with the visible bulk of obedience, and with some
   general conformity. Ay! but at first there is only a general purpose to
   serve God in the spirit; but afterward, when they begin to look into
   the breadth of the commandment, still they are sensible of their coming
   short, and how apt they are to wander in this and that point; still
   their sense of duty is increased, because their light, their love to
   God, and their power is increased, and because they draw near to their
   everlasting hopes.

   1. Because their light is increased. By communion with God they see
   more of his holiness. The more a man is exercised in obedience, the
   clearer is his light and understanding, both to God and the will of
   God: Mat. v. 8, Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.'
   All sight of God, it is, as Nazianzen speaks, according to the
   proportion of our purity; and therefore the more communion we have with
   God, the more sight into the nature of God, and the will of God, and
   the more they are held under the awe of God. In moral disciplines, the
   further we wade in them, the more we see of our defects. Those that
   went to Athens, first they counted themselves sophoi`, wise men;
   afterward only philo'sophoi, lovers of wisdom; then they were only men
   that could talk a little; afterward they found themselves nothing. So a
   Christian in communion with God, the longer he converseth with God, the
   more he doth see of his perfection and holiness: Surely I am more
   brutish than any man,' was the expression of wise Agur, Prov. xxx. 2.
   This holy man of God, saith Chrysostom, speaks it not only humbly, but
   truly, as he thinks. Sure they did not compliment with God. These holy
   men, in the serious actings of their souls, they speak as they think.
   Why? Because they have a high sense of Cod's holiness, therefore a
   deeper sense of their own vileness. They think there are hardly any so
   bad as themselves. Now they are convinced that the holy God will not be
   put off with any slight matter; and they are become sensible of that
   precept, Mat. v. 48, Be perfect, as your Father which is in heaven is
   perfect.'

   2. Their love to God is increased by acquaintance with him, and
   therefore their hearts are more tender and sensible of the least
   deflection. The more a man loves God, the more he will do for God: 1
   John v. 3, This is the love of God, that we keep his commandments.'
   That is a clear rule; the more we love God, the more chary we will be
   of his commandments; and therefore they cannot sin upon such easy terms
   as before, nor go to heaven upon such easy terms as they thought
   before.

   3. Their power is increased. He that is grown to a man's estate minds
   other work than what he did when a child; and as they have more
   strength, they look after more work. At first it was only to prevent
   excesses and breaking out of sin, but afterwards to subdue every
   thought to the obedience of Christ.

   4. They are nearer to heaven, and therefore they look after greater
   suitableness to their everlasting estate. They think of that sinless
   and pure estate they shall enjoy there, therefore have a greater sense
   of duty upon them. Natural motion, saith the philosopher, is slower in
   the beginning, and swifter in the end and close; so spiritual motion in
   the end and close ariseth to a greater vigour of holiness; that which
   served before will not serve their turn now: Phil. iii. 14, they are
   pressing forward toward the mark,' &c.; they are hastening apace, and
   strain themselves when the prize is so near.

   Secondly, As they have a larger sense of duty, so they have a greater
   experience of the dangers and difficulties that do attend them.
   Aristotle observes of young men, that they are more given to hope than
   the old are. They are of great and strong hopes. He renders three
   reasons for it--because they are eager of spirit, have little
   experience, and look but to a few things; and therefore they are
   forward to get abroad in the world, and to entangle themselves in the
   early cares of a family, until their rashness be confuted by their own
   miscarriage. So it is true of young Christians; they are all on a
   flame, ready to run into the mouth of danger upon the confidence of
   their present affections; and till they have smarted often, this
   confidence is not abated.

   But men that have been exercised and experienced are more sensible of
   the naughtiness and inconstancy of their own hearts: Ps. li. 6, In the
   hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom;' and therefore are more
   diffident of their own strength, and desire the Lord to keep them from
   wandering. We see, then, a cautelous fear is necessary to the last; it
   is useful to us not only to begin, but to work out our salvation: Phil.
   ii. 12, Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;' not only
   when we are novices, and so weak, and more liable to temptation, but to
   the close of our days: Prov. xxviii. 14, Blessed is the man that
   feareth always.' That fear which causeth diffidence, and doubting, and
   despair, is a torment, not a blessedness; yet the fear that is opposite
   to carnal security and presuming on our own strength, is a fruit of
   grace and spiritual experience. This is that which stirreth up care and
   diligence in our heavenly calling, and dependence upon God, and
   constant addresses to him; that keepeth us humble and waiting for the
   supplies of his grace.

   Doct. 2. It is God alone that can keep us from wandering.

   Reas. There is in man's heart a mighty proneness thereto: Jer. xiv. 10,
   you have hearts that love to wander.' Man is a restless creature, that
   loveth shifts and changes. For weakness they are compared to children,
   Hosea xi. 3, and for wandering compared to sheep, Isa. liii. 6. There
   is no creature so apt to go astray as sheep, and so unable to return.
   This is the disposition of men by nature. And mark, much of the old
   nature remains still with the saints. Have they not this wandering
   property to the last? David acknowledgeth it, though there were some
   good in him: Ps. cxix. 176, I have gone astray like a lost sheep.'
   Consider the saints; though they have sincerity, yet not perfection;
   and sometimes they wander through in advertency; they are overtaken,
   Gal. vi. 1, as Noah was--they do not run of their own accord. And
   sometimes we err through the darkness that is in us. Though a child of
   God be light in the Lord,' yet he hath a great deal of darkness still.
   It may be he is wise in generals, but ignorant in particulars, as the
   heathen; in general they had good notions of an infinite and eternal
   power, but they were vain in their imaginations.' Rom. i. 21, in their
   practical inferences and discourses, when they came to rest upon this
   God. So a child of God may have a general sense of his duty, but as to
   particulars he is apt to miscarry; the mind may be blinded by lust and
   prejudice.

   Sometimes they err through frowardness of their own lust: there is a
   law in their members which wars against the law of their minds.' Rom.
   vii. There are boisterous lusts, and a man hath much ado to keep his
   path: Ps. lxxiii., My foot had well-nigh slipped.' Therefore we had
   need God should keep us continually. And the Lord hath undertaken to
   guide us: Isa. lviii. 11, The Lord shall guide thee continually;' and
   Ps. xlviii. 14, He will be our guide even unto death;' and Ps. lxxiii.
   24, Thou shalt guide me by thy counsel, and afterward receive me to thy
   glory.' We need this constant guidance and direction from God, that he
   may still lead us, and keep us from wandering and turning aside.

   Use. You see, then, what need we have of a guide and shepherd, and of
   constant dependence upon God. Of all titles, this is the title given to
   the saints; they are a flock, and the sheep of God's pasture;' and
   Christ is called the shepherd of souls,' 1 Peter ii. 25. There is no
   creature of such a dependence as sheep. Dogs and swine can roam, abroad
   all the day, and find their way home again at night, but sheep must
   have a guide to keep them in the fold, and to reduce them when gone
   astray, Luke xv. The good shepherd brought him home upon his shoulders.
   Lord, saith Austin, I can go astray of myself, but I cannot come back
   of myself. We need often to put up this request, Oh, let me not wander
   from thy commandments.'
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON XII.

   Thy word have I hid in my heart, that I might not sin against
   thee.--Ver. 11.

   IN this verse you have David's practice, and the aim and end of it.

   1. His practice, I have hid thy word in my heart.

   2. The aim and end of it, that I might not sin against thee.

   In the first, his practice, observe these circumstances--

   1. The object or matter, the word.

   2. The act of duty, I have hid.

   3. The subject, the heart.

   I shall open these circumstances.

   1. The object, the word. The revelation of God's mind to his people is
   called his law, his testimonies, his ways, his precepts, his statutes,
   his commandments, his judgments, and now his word; whereby is meant
   God's expounding his mind as if he himself did speak to us. The
   expression is general, and compriseth promises, threatenings,
   doctrines, counsels, precepts. All these must be hid in the heart.

   2. The act of duty, I have hid. A thing may be hidden two ways, either
   to conceal it, or else to cherish and keep it.

   [1.] To conceal it; hid so as the unprofitable servant did hide his
   talent in a napkin, Mat. xxv. So David, typifying Christ, saith, I have
   not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy
   faithfulness and thy salvation; I have not concealed thy
   loving-kindness and truth from the great congregation.'

   [2.] To be kept as things of price, as jewels and treasures are hid den
   in chests and secret places, that they may not be embezzled or
   purloined. And herein there may be an allusion to the law, which was
   kept in a chest or ark, Exod. xxv. 21. Thus the word is hidden, not in
   order to concealment, but safety. As to the conceit of hiding our
   knowledge, that we may not lose it by vainglory, which Chrysostom and
   Theodoret mention on the place, it is a conceit so foreign, that it
   need not to be mentioned. What we value most preciously we save most
   carefully.

   3. The subject or place where the word is hidden, in the heart. Not the
   brain, or mind and memory only, but the heart, the seat of affections.
   To hide the word in our hearts is to understand and remember it, and to
   be affected to it and with it. Christ saith, John xiv. 21, He that hath
   my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me.' First we
   must have them, and then keep them. First we know them, then assent to
   them, and then approve them, because of the authority of the lawgiver,
   and the excellency of the thing commanded; and then respect them as a
   treasure that we are chary of; and having them still in our eye, do
   thereby regulate our practice and conversation. In short, by holding it
   in our hearts is meant not only a knowledge of the word, but an assent
   to it; not only an assent to it, but a serious and sound digestion of
   it by meditation; not only a digestion, but a constant respect to it,
   that we may not transgress it as it is a rule, nor lose it as it is a
   treasure, but may have it ready and forthcoming upon all occasions.

   The points are these:--

   Doct. 1. One duty and necessary practice of God's children is to hide
   the word in their hearts.

   Doct. 2. That in hiding the word in our hearts, there must be a right
   end; our knowledge of it and delight in it must be directed to
   practice.

   1. That one duty and necessary practice of God's children is to hide
   the word in their hearts. See it confirmed by a scripture or two: Josh.
   i. 8, This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou
   shalt meditate therein day and night;' Job xxii. 22, Receive, I pray
   thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thy heart.' By
   the law is meant the whole word of God. Lay up his words,' as we would
   do choice things, that they may not be lost or embezzled; and lay them
   up as treasure to be used upon all occasions. In the heart;' let them
   not swim in the brain or memory only, but let the heart be affected
   with it: Col. iii. 16, Let the word of God dwell in you richly;' be so
   diligent in the study of the scripture, that it may become familiar
   with us, by frequent hearing, reading, meditating, conferring about it.
   As a stranger, let it not stand at the door, but receive it into an
   inner room; be as familiar as those that dwell with you. God
   complaineth of his people: Hosea viii. 12, I have written to them the
   great things of my law, but they were counted as a strange thing.' To
   be strangers to the word of God, and little conversant in it, is a
   great evil. What is it to hide the word in our hearts? (1.) To
   understand it, to get a competent knowledge of it; we take in things
   into the soul by the understanding: Prov. ii. 10, When wisdom entereth
   into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul.' There is
   first an entrance by knowledge. (2.) When it is assented unto by faith.
   The word is settled in the heart by faith, otherwise it soon vanisheth:
   Heb. iv. 2, The word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with
   faith in them that heard it,' (3.) When it is kindly entertained: John
   viii. 37, Christ complains, Ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no
   place in you,' ou chorei en humin. Men are so possessed with lust and
   prejudice, that there is no room for Christ's word. Though it break in
   upon the heart with evidence and power, yet it is not entertained
   there, but cast out again as an unwelcome guest. (4.) When it is deeply
   rooted. Many men have flashes for a time; their affections may be much
   aloft, and they may have great fits and elevations of joy and delight,
   but no sound grace: John v. 35, Ye rejoiced in his light for a season.'
   But now the word must be settled into a standing affection, if we would
   have comfort and profit by it. We read of the ingrafted word,' James i.
   21. There is a word bearing fruit, and a word ingrafted. Till there be
   the root of the matter in us, in vain do we expect fruit.

   The reasons why this is one duty and practice of the saints, to hide
   the word in their hearts, are two:--

   Reas. 1. First, that we may have it ready for our use. We lay up
   principles, that we may lay them out upon all occasions. Man hath an
   ingestive and an egestive faculty; when it is hid in the heart, it will
   be ready to break out in the tongue and practice, and be forthcoming to
   direct us in every duty and exigency. When persons run to the market
   for every pennyworth, it doth not become good housekeepers. To be to
   seek of comforts when we should use them, or to run to a book, is not
   so comfortable as to hide it in the heart. As Christ saith, A good
   scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven, bringeth forth
   out of his treasure things new and old,' Mat. xiii. 52. He hath not
   only this year's growth, but the last year's gathering (for so is the
   allusion made); he hath not only from hand to mouth, but a good stock
   by him. So should a Christian have not only knowledge from hand to
   mouth, but a good stock and treasure in his heart, which is a very
   great advantage in these seven things.

   1. It will prevent vain thoughts. What is the reason evil is so ready
   and present with us? Because our stock of knowledge is so small. A man
   that hath a pocket fuller of brass farthings than pieces of silver,
   will more readily draw out farthings than shillings; his stock is
   greater. So vain thoughts will be more ready with us, unless the word
   dwell richly in our hearts: Mat. xii. 35, A good man out of the good
   treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things; and an evil man out
   of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.' The workings of our
   spirits are as our treasure and stock. The mind works upon what it
   finds in itself, as a mill grinds whatsoever is put into it, chaff or
   corn. Therefore, if we would prevent wicked thoughts, and musings of
   vanity all the day long, we must hide the word in our heart.

   2. When you are alone and without outward helps, your hearts will
   furnish you with matter of counsel, or comfort, or reproof: Ps. xvi. 7,
   My reins instruct me in the night season.' When we are alone, and there
   is a veil of darkness drawn upon the world, and we have not the benefit
   of a bible, a minister, or Christian friends, our reins will instruct
   us; we may draw out of our heart that which will be for our comfort and
   refreshing. A Christian is to be a walking bible, to have a good stock
   and treasure in himself.

   3. It will supply us in prayer. Barrenness and leanness of soul is a
   very great defect, which God's children often complain of. One great
   reason is, because the word of God doth not dwell plenteously in them,
   so that in every prayer we are to seek. If the heart were often
   exercised in the word, the promises would hold up our hearts in prayer,
   enlarge our affections, and we should be better able to pour out our
   spirits before him: Ps. xlv. 1, My heart is inditing a good matter.'
   What then? My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.' When the heart is
   full, the tongue will be loosed and speak freely. What is the reason we
   are so dumb and tongue-tied in prayer? Be cause our heart is so barren.
   When the spring is dry, there will be little water in the stream: Eph.
   vi. 17, Take the sword of the Spirit, that is the word of God;' then
   presently, praying with all manner of supplication.' When we have a
   good store of the word of God it will burst out in prayer.

   4. It will be a great help to us in all businesses and affairs. Prov.
   vi. 21, 22, speaking of the precepts of God, Bind them upon thy heart;
   when thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep
   thee; when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.' Upon all occasions
   the word will be ready to cast in seasonable thoughts. When we awake,
   our most early thoughts in the morning will begin with God, to season
   the heart all the day; and as we are about our business, the word will
   hold our hearts in the fear of God; and when we sleep, it will guard
   thee from vain dreams and light imaginations. In a wicked man sin
   engrosseth all the thoughts; it employs him all the day, plays in his
   fancy all the night; it solicits him first in the morning, because he
   is a stranger to the word of God. But a man that is a bible to himself,
   the word will be ever upon him, urging him to duty, restraining him
   from sin, directing him in his ways, seasoning his work and employment.
   Therefore we should hide the word in our hearts.

   5. It is a great relief against temptations to have the word ready. The
   word is called The sword of the Spirit,' Eph. vi. 17. In spiritual
   conflicts there is none to that. Those that ride abroad in time of
   danger will not be without a sword. We are in danger, and had need
   handle the sword of the Spirit. The more ready the scripture is with
   us, the greater advantage in our conflicts and temptations. When the
   devil came to assault Christ, he had scripture ready for him, whereby
   he overcame the tempter. The door is barred upon Satan, and he cannot
   find such easy entrance, when the word is hid in our hearts, and made
   use of pertinently: 1 John ii. 14, I write to you, young men, because
   ye are strong.' Where lies their strength? And the word of God abideth
   in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.' Oh, it is a great
   advantage when we have the word not only by us, but in us, ingrafted in
   the heart! When it is present with us, we are more able to resist the
   assaults of Satan. Either a man for gets the word or hath lost his
   affection to it, before he can be drawn to sin. The word of God, when
   it hath gotten into the heart, it will furnish us with seasonable
   thoughts.

   6. It is a great relief in troubles and afflictions. Our faintings come
   from ignorance, or our forgetfulness: Heb. xii. 5, Ye have for gotten
   the consolation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son,
   despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art
   rebuked of him.' If we had a herb growing in our gardens that would
   ease our smart, what are we the better if we know it not? There is no
   malady but what hath its remedy in the word. To have a comfort ready is
   a great relief.

   7. It makes our conference and conversation with others more gracious:
   Mat. xii. 34, Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.'
   When we have a great deal of hidden treasure in the soul it will get
   out at the tongue; for there is a quick intercourse between the heart
   and the tongue. The tap runs according to the liquor where with the
   vessel is filled. Come to men of an unsavoury spirit, pierce them,
   broach them, give them occasion again and again for discourse, and you
   get nothing but frothy communication from them and vain talk. But now a
   man that hath stored his heart with the word is ever and anon
   interposing for God. Like a bottle filled with wine, he must have vent.
   As the spouse's lips are said to drop as honey combs,' they are ever
   putting forth savoury expressions in their converse with others: Col.
   iii. 16, Let the word of God dwell in you richly, teaching and
   admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs.' It
   will burst out presently if the word of God dwell in your hearts.

   Before I go to the second reason, let me answer an objection: But is
   not this to take from the Spirit, and to give it to the word? and that
   to the word, not as written in God's book, but as it is in our hearts?
   Will not this be to ascribe all to created grace? I answer--

   1. Questionless it is the office of the Spirit to bring things to our
   remembrance, and the great help of the Spirit of God is by suggesting
   such passages as may be of most seasonable relief to the soul in
   temptations, in prayer, and in business, John xiv. 16. But what is
   given to the scriptures and grace is not to the wrong of the Spirit,
   for the scripture is of his inditing, and grace is of his working; yea,
   we still reserve the chief honour to the Holy Ghost, for he not only
   worketh grace, but worketh by grace. He not only indites the scripture,
   but works by it; it is he that quickeneth prayer; and therefore it is
   ill trusting to our own understanding and memory, for it is the Spirit
   that is the great remembrancer, and impresseth upon the mind savoury
   and seasonable thoughts.

   2. I grant further, the children of God are subject to much
   forgetfulness of the truth that is impressed upon their hearts. Partly
   through the present cloud and mist which the temptation raiseth. The
   Psalmist had truths enough to support him, Ps. lxxiii. 17; yet he
   saith, Until I went into the sanctuary of God, I was foolish and
   ignorant; I was as a beast before thee.' There is so much dulness upon
   the children of God that they cannot remember seasonable thoughts; as
   Hagar had a fountain by her, yet she did not see it till God opened her
   eyes, Gen. xxi. So under the temptation all are benighted, and the
   light that is in the understanding is obscured. And partly through the
   little sense they have for the present of the need of the comforts
   which the word propoundeth; few so wise as to lay up for a dear year.
   And partly through sloth and negligence, being taken up with other
   things. It is possible sometimes that we may be guided by the Spirit,
   and act right merely by the guidance of the Holy Ghost, without any
   interposing and concurrence of our own understandings; as John xii. 13,
   compared with ver. 16, They took branches of palm-trees, and went forth
   to meet him; and cried, Hosanna, blessed is the King of Israel that
   cometh in the name of the Lord.' These things understood not his
   disciples at the first; but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered
   they that these things were written of him, and that they had done
   these things unto him.' Mark, they were guided by the Spirit to do that
   they knew not for the present; they had only a back-look, not a
   foresight; they were ignorant of what they were doing until afterward;
   thoughts came not in their mind but only in the review: John ii. 22,
   When he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had
   said this unto them.' They did not take up the meaning of them, yet
   they were guided aright. They did not carp against Christ, as the Jews
   did. They were guided by the Spirit in a case they were wholly
   ignorant.

   3. The Holy Ghost makes use of a sanctified memory, bringing scriptures
   to our remembrance as we have need. It is made their act, because the
   Holy Ghost made use of their memories: They remembered that it was
   written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up,' John ii. 17. They
   that neglect to search and hide the word in their hearts, they have not
   such seasonable refreshment; for God works more strongly with the
   strongest graces; there where there is the greater receptivity, there
   is the greater influence; those that are ignorant cannot expect such
   help as those that have the word dwell richly in their hearts.

   The second reason is, therefore should we hide the word in our hearts,
   because God doth so in the work of conversion: Heb. viii. 10, I will
   put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts.' The mind
   is compared to tables of stone, and the heart to the ark; and so this
   is required of us to write them upon the table of our heart,' Prov.
   vii. 3; and here, I have hidden thy word in my heart.' How doth this
   follow? because God doth so in conversion, therefore it is our duty?

   I answer--(1.) God requires what he works, to show the creature's duty,
   as well as the power of his own grace. God is to convert and turn; yet
   do you turn, circumcise your heart, and I will circumcise; mortify your
   members, &c.; and yet, If ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of
   the body, ye shall live.' He gives and requires; to engage the
   subserviency of our endeavours, and to make us sensible of our duty and
   obligation. (2.) This followeth because this work must be gone over
   again and again that it may be more explicit. We must revive the work,
   and put a fresh copy of the law into our heart, to keep the old work
   a-foot

   Use 1. To persuade you to study the scripture, that you may get
   understanding, and hide the word in your hearts for gracious purposes.
   This is the book of books; let it not lie idle and unemployed. The
   world can as well be without the sun as the bible. Ps. xix., first he
   speaks of the sun, then of the law of God. This is to the Christian and
   gracious world as the sun is to the outward world. The use and profit
   of it should make us look after more acquaintance with it. Consider the
   great use of the word for informing the understanding and reforming the
   will. For informing the understanding: 2 Tim. iii. 17, the word of God
   is able to make the man of God perfect, and thoroughly furnished.' Who
   should have more knowledge than the man of God, that is to stand in
   God's stead, and teach the people? Then for reforming the will: ver. 9
   of this psalm, Wherewith shall a young man cleanse his way? By taking
   heed thereto according to thy word.' A young man that is so heedless
   and headstrong, and in the very ruff and heat of his lusts, yet there
   is enough in the word to cleanse and tame him, and subdue him to God.
   Oh! therefore, let us get it into our hearts; let it not only move the
   lighter part of the soul, but get rooting, that it may have its full
   power and force, that we may not only have a little knowledge to talk
   of it; but we are to hide it deeply, that it may take root, and spring
   up again in our lives and conversations. To this end meditate often of
   it, and receive it in the love of it.

   1. Meditate often of it: Luke ii. 19, Mary kept all these sayings.' How
   did she keep them? She pondered them in her heart.' Musing makes the
   fire to burn, and deep and constant thoughts are operative; not a
   glance or a slight view. The hen which straggleth from her nest when
   she sits a-brooding produceth nothing; it is a constant incubation
   which hatcheth the young. So when we have only a few straggling
   thoughts, and do not sit a-brooding upon a truth; when we have flashes
   only, like a little glance of a sunbeam upon a wall, it doth nothing;
   but serious and inculcative thoughts, through the Lord's blessing, will
   do the work. Urge the heart again and again; as the apostle, when he
   had laid down the doctrine of justification and the privileges thereof:
   Rom. viii. 31, Now what shall we say to these things?' Is this a
   truth?--then what will become of me if I disregard it? Thus to return
   upon our heart when any light begins to shine in our minds from the
   scripture: is this the word of God, and doth it find no more
   entertainment in my heart?

   2. Receive it in the love of it. The apostle makes that to be the
   ground of apostasy: 2 Thes. ii. 10, Because they received not the truth
   in the love of it,' &c. Oh! let it soak into the affections. If it lie
   only in the tongue or in the mind, only to make it a matter of talk and
   speculation, it will be soon gone. The seed which lies upon the
   surface, the fowls of the air will pick it up. Therefore hide it
   deeply; let it get from the ear into the mind, from the mind into the
   heart; let it soak further and further. First men have a naked
   apprehension of truth, then it gets into the conscience, and then it
   lies in the heart, then it is laid up; but when we suffer it only to be
   made matter of speculation, it is soon lost. Know this, a man may
   receive a thing in the evidence and light of it, when he doth not
   receive it in the love of it. When it rests in naked speculation, then
   he receives a thing in the evidence and light of it; but when it hath a
   prevailing sovereignty in the heart, then we receive it in the love of
   it. When it is dearer than our dearest lust, then it will stick by us;
   when we are willing to sell all for the pearl of price, Mat. xiii. 46.
   We are often put to it what we will part with--our lusts or the truth.
   When it breaks in upon the heart with evidence and power, you cannot
   keep both. Therefore let it soak into the affections, and hide the word
   in your hearts, that you may not sin against God.

   Use 2. To direct you what to do in reading, hearing, meditating.

   1. In reading. Hide the word in your hearts. The word may be reduced to
   doctrines, promises, threatenings. (1.) For doctrines, lay up
   knowledge, Prov. x. 14. It is a notable preservative against sin, and
   an antidote against the infection of the world, when we have a good
   stock of principles: Ps. xxxvii. 31, The law of God is in his heart;
   none of his steps shall slide.' As long as truth is kept lively and
   active, and in view of conscience, we shall not slide, or not so often
   slide. We have many temptations to divert us from the truth and
   obedience; but here we are in safety, when the law of God is in our
   heart. How often was the word of God in Joseph's heart: How can I do
   this great wickedness and sin against God?' Against God, that is of
   such a sovereign majesty!--against God, of such infinite goodness and
   mighty power, so able to save and to destroy! Every time you read the
   scriptures you should lay up something. The best way to destroy ill
   weeds is by planting the ground with right seed. Everywhere we shall
   meet with notable passages. Therefore, stock yourselves with good
   principles. (2.) Then for promises, that part of the word. What have
   you hidden in your heart for comfort against temptations, desertions,
   afflictions? What have you laid up against a dear year? Job xxii. 22,
   Lay up his word in thine heart.' In a time of trial you will find one
   promise will give you more comfort and support than all the arguments
   that can be produced by reason: Ps. cxix. 50, This is my comfort in my
   affliction; thy word hath quickened me.' He had a word to support him.
   Therefore let us treasure up all the promises; all will be little
   enough when we need comforts. That we may not have them to seek in a
   time of distress, it is good they should be familiar. As you read the
   word, collect for your comfort and profit; happy is the man that hath
   his garner full of them. (3.) And so for threatenings, especially
   against the sins we are most inclinable to: Who among you will give
   ear, and hear for the time to come?' Isa. xlii. 23. You should think of
   what will come afterward. It is well with you for the present, but
   matters to come are put off, little cared for, Amos vi. 3.

   2. In hearing. Do not hear slightly, but hide the word in your heart,
   that it be not embezzled by thy own negligence, forgetfulness, running
   into carnal distractions; that it be not purloined by Satan, that he
   may not snatch away the good seed out of thy soul. When the word is
   preached, there is more company present than is visible; there are
   angels and devils in the assembly. Whenever the sons of God meet
   together, Satan is present with them. The devil is present to divert
   the mind by wandering thoughts, by raising prejudices, that we may cast
   out the word; or by excuses, delays, evasions, putting it off to others
   when we begin to have some sensibleness of our sin and danger. The
   devil is loath to let us go too far, lest Christ get a subject into his
   kingdom. Oh! therefore, labour to get something into thy heart by every
   sermon; some fresh notion or consideration is given out to set you
   a-work in the spiritual life. A conscientious waiting upon God will
   find something every time. It is sad to consider^how many have heard
   much, and laid up little or nothing at all; it may be they have laid it
   up in their note-books, but not laid up the word in their hearts.

   3. For meditation. Meditate upon the word; do not study the word in a
   cursory manner, or content yourselves with a slight taste, or a little
   volatile affection; but ponder it seriously, that it may enter into
   your very heart. Hasty and perfunctory thoughts work nothing. Meat must
   be well chewed and digested, if you would have it turn into good blood
   and spirits. You must follow it close till it settle into some
   affection.

   So much for David's practice, I have hid thy word in my heart.

   The second thing is the aim and end of it, that I may not sin against
   thee.

   Doct. 2. In hiding the word in our hearts there must be a right end;
   our knowledge of it and delight in it must be directed to practice.

   1. We must not study the word merely out of curiosity, that we may know
   what is said there, as men will pry into civil art and discipline. So
   the Athenians flocked about Paul, Acts xvii. 18-21; so for novelty's
   sake men may have an affection and a delight in the word: John v. 35,
   Ye rejoiced in his light for a season.' There are certain adulterous
   affections we have to the word when it is new and fresh, but when it
   grows stale we loathe it. This affection to the word is soon spent.

   2. We must not hide the word in our heart merely that we may be able to
   teach others, that we may make a gainful trade of it. Alas! a man may
   teach others and be himself a castaway. Look, as in coining of money,
   an iron stamp may impress the character and print upon a piece of gold
   and silver, so God may use the gifts and know ledge of some men to
   beget faith in others, and perish themselves: Mat. vii. 21, We have
   prophesied in thy name;' yet Depart from me; I know you not.'

   3. This must not be our end neither, not merely for delight. Largeness
   of knowledge brings a content with it, as it is an addition to our
   perfection. Truth is the object of our understanding, and may please an
   unsanctified mind. Not merely out of subserviency to some base and
   inferior ends, that we may get esteem in the world, or the repute of
   knowing persons, but as it is an elevation of the understanding. Every
   delight in truth is not a delight in God. There is a natural
   oblectation we have in the contemplation of any sublime truth; this is
   merely a delight in the work of our own faculties, when the affections
   are terminated in bare knowledge; as it is a high and mysterious truth,
   as it is a delectation to the understanding.

   4. We are not merely to study the word for the comfortableness of it,
   and the suitableness to the conscience. As man is a reasonable
   creature, he will delight in knowledge; and as he hath a conscience
   presageous of death and judgment to come, he may delight in the comfort
   of it. Many search out promises that do not affect precepts. The stony
   ground seemed to have a joy; they may delight in the comfortable part
   of religion; but this joy comes to nothing this glad some forward
   spring is no sure prognostication of a plentiful harvest. Then do we
   receive the word aright when we look to the holy part, and mortify our
   natural desires and affections. Many deal with the word as great men do
   with fleshly companions--are willing to entertain them at their tables
   to hear their discourse, because of the pleasantness of their mirth;
   but to enter into bonds for them, and discharge them from debt, or
   better their fortunes, that they will not do. So many will give Christ
   and the word, and the comfortable part of it, entertainment; but they
   are loath to take the duty of the gospel upon themselves. Therefore, it
   is not enough to study the word merely that we may cherish our own
   persons with the comfortable part of it; but we must also study the
   holy part of it, and that which doth require our duty. Let us labour to
   hide the word in our hearts, as David did: I have hid thy word in my
   heart, that I might not sin against thee.'
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON XIII.

   Blessed art thou, O Lord: teach me thy statutes.--Ver. 12.

   IN these words you have:--

   1. A compellation, blessed art thou, O Lord.

   2. A supplication, teach me thy statutes.

   First, The compellation carrieth the force of an argument: Because thou
   art blessed, O Lord, therefore teach me. And therefore I shall open the
   sense of this title that is here given to God, so as I may still make
   good the argument.

   For the sense, God may be said to be blessed objectively or
   subjectively.

   First, Objectively, as he is the object of our blessedness. It is our
   blessedness to enjoy God: Ps. cxliv. 15, Blessed is the people whose
   God is the Lord.' That is our blessedness, to have God for our portion.
   As soon as we are admitted into covenant with God, we have a right to
   him: I am thy God;' and we have the full consummation of it when we
   enter into heaven; there we have the highest enjoyment of God that we
   are capable of. We have many fruitless and unquiet cares to enjoy the
   creatures, which are neither blessed in themselves, nor can make us
   blessed; but now God is our summum bonum, our chief good; the enjoyment
   of him is the chiefest good. Still we are capable of a higher happiness
   until we enjoy God. In other things we can neither have satisfaction
   nor security: the creature cannot satisfy, nor yet secure us in the
   enjoyment of itself. In this sense the argument will hold good: Blessed
   art thou, O Lord;' that is, Thou art the object of my blessedness; my
   blessedness lieth in the enjoyment of thee; therefore teach me thy
   statutes. If God be our chiefest good and our utmost end, it concerns
   us nearly to learn out the way how we may enjoy him: John xvii. 3, This
   is life eternal, to know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom
   thou hast sent.' It concerns believers to study that wherein their
   eternal happiness consisteth, and what is the way to get it: Thou art
   blessed, and therefore teach me thy statutes.'

   Secondly, Subjectively; and so again God is blessed either in an active
   or in a passive sense.

   1. In an active sense. And here we must distinguish again; for so God
   is blessed either with respect to himself or with respect to us.

   [1.] Blessed in himself, as he hath the fulness of perfection and
   contentment. Blessedness is often ascribed to God: 1 Tim. i. 11, The
   glorious gospel of the blessed God.' I will open that place by and by:
   1 Tim. vi. 15, Who is the blessed and only potentate, the King of
   kings, and Lord of lords.' Now, how is God blessed in himself? God's
   blessedness is that attribute by which the Lord, from himself, and in
   his own being, is free from all misery and enjoyeth all good, and is
   sufficient to himself, and contented with himself, and doth neither
   need nor desire the creature for any good that can accrue to him by us.
   Or, more shortly, God's blessedness is the fruition of himself, and his
   delighting in himself. Mark, it lieth not in the enjoyment of the
   creature, but in the enjoyment of himself. God useth us, but doth not
   enjoy us. As we enjoy a thing for itself, but we use it for another; so
   uti and frui differ: we use the means, but enjoy the end. God useth the
   creature in subserviency to his own glory. So it is said: Prov. xvi. 4,
   God made all things for himself.' His happiness lieth in knowing
   himself, in loving himself, in delighting in himself.

   But how is this used as an argument, Blessed art thou, O Lord;
   therefore teach me thy statutes'? Either thus: God, that is blessed,
   hath enough for himself; surely there is enough in him for us too: Gen.
   xvii. 1, I am God all-sufficient; walk before me, and be thou perfect.'
   I say, if God finds satisfaction enough in himself, our souls surely
   will find satisfaction in him. That which will fill a pottle, or
   greater measure, will fill a pint or a lesser measure; that which will
   satisfy a prince, and be enough for him in that estate, will satisfy a
   beggar, and supply his wants. God hath an infinite fulness of know
   ledge, comfort, and holiness; therefore surely enough to satisfy us, as
   empty as we are. Therefore we should desire to receive of this fulness
   in God's way. Or, again, thus: If God be blessed, we had need to
   inquire after his statutes, for these teach us the way how we may be
   blessed in God's blessedness, how we may be conformed to the nature of
   God, and live the life of God, and then surely we shall be happy
   enough. (1.) How we may be conformed to the nature of God: 2 Peter i.
   4, That we may be partakers of the divine nature,' according to our
   measure, that ours may be such as his is. The promises, or the word,
   have an influence that way. If we see a man hath a rich trade, and
   secret ways of gain, every one would be acquainted with the mysteries
   and art of his getting, and desirous to know it. God is eternally
   blessed, therefore we should study to be like him. (2.) That we may
   live the life of God. Surely if we could learn to live such a life as
   God doth, we should be happy. However our prejudices darken it, yet the
   life of God cannot be a gloomy life. Now, ignorance of God's statutes
   is a great hindrance to the life of God: Eph. iv. 18, Being alienated
   or estranged from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in
   them, because of the blindness of their heart.' Well, then, the
   consideration of this, that God is blessed, will certainly make us
   prize his statutes, prize his word, for by that we are conformed to the
   nature of God, and to the life of God; we are engaged in the same
   design wherein God himself is engaged: God loves himself, and acts for
   himself, and pursueth his own glory. Now when the word of God breaks in
   upon the heart, we pursue the same design with God. Men are prejudiced
   against a course of holiness; it seems to look upon them with a sour
   and austere face. Surely God loves a pleasant life; whoever is
   miserable, he hath a full contentment. Doth he that made all things
   want true joy and contentment? Who should have happiness if God hath
   not? Now, when we learn, God's statutes, we come to be conformed to the
   nature of God; we love what he loves, and hate what he hates, and then
   we begin to live the life of God. The happiness of God lieth in loving
   himself, enjoying himself, and acting for his own glory; and this is
   the fruit of grace, to teach us to live as God lives, to do as God
   doth, to love him and enjoy him as our chiefest good, and to glorify
   him as our utmost end. This is the first sense wherein God may be said
   to be actively blessed, as he hath infinite complacency in himself.

   [2.] God is actively blessed with respect to us as he is the fountain
   of all blessedness. He is not only blessedness itself, but willing to
   communicate and give it out to the creature, especially his saints. He
   fills all created things with his blessedness: Ps. cxlv. 16, Thou
   openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing.'
   There is not a creature in the world but hath tasted of God's bounty,
   but especially the saints: Eph. i. 3, Blessed be the God and Father of
   our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings
   in Christ.' These are vessels into which God is still pouring more,
   until they be completely filled up. Now, this communicativeness that is
   in God, without any irking of mind, is a certain argument or
   encouragement to move us to seek of God grace to keep his statutes.
   This is often urged in this case, his communicativeness to all his
   creatures: ver. 64, The earth, O Lord, is full of thy mercy; teach me
   thy statutes.' Thou art bountiful to all creatures; and, O Lord, show
   thy bounty to me. The same again: ver. 68, Thou art good, and dost
   good; teach me thy statutes.' Every good, the more good it is, the more
   it is diffusive of itself. And it is a part of God's blessedness that
   he is still of the giving hand: Acts xx. 35, Remember the words of the
   Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.'
   It was a maxim which Christ commended to his disciples: Remember the
   words of the Lord Jesus;' that which he often inculcated, That it is
   more blessed to give than to receive.' The words formally indeed are
   not found in any evangelist; only there we may see the whole drift of
   Christ's doctrine was to press men to give; it is a more blessed thing.
   This is the happiness of God, that he gives to all, and receives of
   none; that he is so ready to communicate of his own fulness upon such
   free terms: John i. 16, Of his fulness have all we received, and grace
   for grace;' that is, grace for grace's sake. Thus we have seen how God
   is actively blessed.

   2. God is passively blessed as he is blessed by us, or as worthy of all
   praise from us, for his goodness, righteousness, and mercy, and the
   communications of his grace. There are two words by which our
   thanksgiving is expressed--praise and blessing. You have both in Ps.
   cxlv. 10, All thy works shall praise thee, O Lord; and thy saints shall
   bless thee.' Praise relateth to God's excellency, and blessing to his
   benefits. His works declare his excellency: but his saints, which are
   sensible of his benefits, they bless him; they count him worthy of all
   honour and praise, and are ever ascribing to him, Rev. v. 13, Blessing,
   honour, glory, and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and
   unto the Lamb for ever and ever.' Why blessing? As for other things, so
   it was for opening the book which was sealed with seven seals, and
   revealing his mind to his people; as you may see, ver. 9. So David
   here, Blessed art thou, O Lord: teach me thy statutes.' As if he had
   said, Lord, thou art, and thou shalt be blessed: I bless thee that thou
   hast taught me; and I desire thou wouldst teach me still, that I may
   ever bless thee. Thus it may be taken in a passive sense, as he is the
   object of our blessedness. [6]

   Well, then, all that I have said upon this compellation may be reduced
   to these six propositions:--

   1. That God is over all, and above all, blessed enough in himself, and
   needeth nothing from us to add to his happiness and perfection.

   That he is blessed enough in himself: Rom. ix. 5, God over all, blessed
   for ever.' That he needs nothing from us to add to his happiness and
   perfection: Ps. xvi. 2, My righteousness, my goodness, extendeth not to
   thee.' He is above our benefits and injuries. If there could result any
   one happiness to God from the creature, surely then he would have made
   the world sooner; what hindered him? for why should he keep himself out
   of his own happiness? And therefore he made the world, not that he
   might be happy, but that he might be liberal. Before ever there was
   hill or mountain, man or angel, God was happy enough in himself. The
   divine persons took infinite delight and complacency in each other; as
   their rejoicing is expressed: Prov. viii. 30, 31, I was daily his
   delight, rejoicing always before him.' God had infinite complacency in
   Christ, and Christ in God, both in the Spirit, all in each, and each in
   all, before ever there was hill or mountain. The world is upheld, as
   stones are in an arch, by a mutual dependence, by a combination of
   interests. We need one another, but God doth not stand in need of us.
   The head cannot say to the foot, I have no need of thee;' the greatest
   stand in need of the meanest, of their labours, their service; the
   meanest parts have their use in the body. But now, God standeth in no
   need of us, for he giveth all, and he receiveth nothing back again; as
   the fountain hath no need of the stream, but the stream hath need of
   the fountain. The sun fills the lap of the earth with blessings, and
   the earth returns nothing but vapours, that obscure its beams rather
   than add anything to its brightness. God filleth every living thing,
   especially his saints, with blessing, and receiveth nothing from us
   again.

   2. Though God stand in no need of us, yet he is willing to communicate
   his blessedness, and to make us happy in the enjoyment of himself.

   There is a threefold consideration which doth advance the bounty of
   God--that to us, that himself to us, and that so readily and freely.

   [1.] That to us, who can neither hurt him nor help him: Ps. viii. 3, 4,
   Lord, what is man that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man that
   thou visitest him?' What a poor sorry creature is man! wilt thou set
   thine eyes upon such a one? What would God lose if we were all damned?
   or what would he gain if all were saved? He would lose no more by us
   than a bounteous man doth by the death of a company of beggars and
   maimed persons, which live upon his expense and charge. Wherein can we
   be useful to God?

   [2.] Herein lieth the bounty of God, to give us such a blessing as the
   enjoyment of himself. When he had no greater thing to swear by, saith
   the apostle, he sware by himself. When God hath no greater thing to
   give us, he gives us himself: I am thy God.' He scatters and sheds
   abroad some common influences upon all creatures; but to us he gives
   not only that which is his, but gives us himself, that when our
   happiness is at the highest, we may immediately enjoy him.

   For the opening of this blessedness in giving us the fruition of
   himself, consider we enjoy God two ways--mediately and immediately; one
   proper to this world, the other to the next.

   (1.) Mediately. We enjoy God when he communicateth himself to us by
   secondary means, or the interposition of the creature between him and
   us. Thus in common mercies, when he feeds us by his meat and drink, and
   enlighteneth us with his sun. Here in the world we have blessings at
   second or third hand: I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the
   earth,' &c., Hosea ii. 21, 22. Whatever one creature affordeth to
   another, it hath it first from God. The creature is but an empty hollow
   pipe through which the blessing runs, and it passeth from pipe to pipe.
   God poureth out his influences to the heavens, and the heavens pour out
   their influences upon the earth; and the strength of the earth runneth
   up into corn, wine, and oil, and by corn, wine, and oil Israel hath his
   refreshments. So still from pipe to pipe is the blessing conveyed to
   the creature. So for special mercies; we have them by degrees; life,
   comfort, grace by the word and seals. But the Lord will not only supply
   us at second and third hand, but--

   (2.) Immediately. When God communicates himself to us without any other
   thing between us and him; when we are immediately present with God, and
   have immediate influences from God, this is the happiness of heaven. In
   the heavenly state God shall be all in all,' 1 Cor. xv. 28. He shall be
   both the dispenser and the dispensation. There we see him face to face,
   and in his face and presence there is fulness of joy,' Ps. xvi. 11.
   That is our happiness in the next world, where immediate influences and
   virtue doth pass out from him. In heaven there is no temple, Rev. xxi.
   22, But the Lamb is the temple of it' There is a service of God, and
   constant influences in that God supplieth all immediately from himself.

   [3.] This is upon free terms: John i. 16, Of his fulness have we all
   received, and grace for grace.'

   3. The word of God, especially the gospel part, doth only teach us the
   way how we may be blessed in the enjoyment of God.

   That is a notable place to this purpose: 1 Tim. i. 11, The glorious
   gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.' Mark
   there, first, he calls it the glorious gospel.' When he speaks of the
   law in that place he saith, We know that the law is good,'--compare it
   with ver. 8; but when he comes to speak of the gospel, he calls it the
   glorious gospel.' The law is good, but the gospel glorious, because
   more of the glory of God is displayed and discovered to the creature.
   And the glorious gospel of the blessed God.' Titles are always suited
   to the case in hand; therefore it is called The glorious gospel of the
   blessed God,' because there God is discovered as ready to bless us;
   there is the way how we may come to be blessed in God, how he may with
   respect to us be a fountain of blessedness; there we have the highest
   discoveries of this mystery, the most moving arguments to persuade us
   to look after it; and with this gospel there is a grace, a virtue
   dispensed to enable us to walk in this way. So that if we would enjoy
   the blessed God, we must consult with his statutes, and especially the
   gospel.

   4. If we would profit by the word of God, we must go to God, and desire
   the light and strength of his grace.

   If we would enjoy the blessed God, according to the direction of his
   word, we must not only consult with the word, but with God. Nothing
   else can draw us off from the world, and persuade us to look after
   heavenly things; nothing else will teach us the vanity of the creature,
   the reality of spiritual privileges. Until we see these things in a
   divine light, the heart hangs off from God; and therefore saith David,
   Ps. xvi. 7, I will bless the Lord, who hath given me counsel.' He had
   chosen God for his portion, and then I will bless the Lord,' &c. We
   shall still run after lying vanities until God doth open your eyes to
   see the mysteries of the word, and to be affected with the way. Those
   that are drawn to God must first be taught of God: John vi. 44, No man
   cometh to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him;' for
   Christ adds presently, They shall be all taught of God.' Our hearts can
   never be drawn unto God until he take us into his own hands.

   5. The more we are brought to attend upon the word, and the more
   influence the word hath upon us, the nearer the blessing.

   Christians, we are not far from the kingdom of God. There is some
   blessedness when we begin to look after the directions of the word, and
   to wait upon the teachings of God: Prov. viii. 34, Blessed is the man
   that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my
   doors.' Then you are in a hopeful way to true blessedness when you
   begin to be careful to attend upon God's teaching, much more when you
   have the fruits of it, when you know him so as to love him, so as to
   have your hearts drawn off from sin and folly: Acts iii. 26, Him hath
   God sent to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his
   iniquities.' The great business of Jesus Christ is to make us blessed
   in the enjoyment of God. But how is it? only by bare knowledge? No, it
   is by turning every one from his iniquity. So the more this teaching of
   God prevails upon the heart, the more blessed we are: Ps. cxix. 1,
   Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord.'
   Otherwise, to have a golden head and feet of clay, that is monstrous,
   as in Nebuchadnezzar's image; to have a naked knowledge of God, and not
   brought under the power of it. You read of the heathens, when they
   sacrificed to their gods, they were wont to hang a garland upon the
   heads of the beasts, and to crown them with roses, so they were led on
   to sacrifice. Many may have garlands upon their heads, ornaments of
   knowledge, yet are going on to destruction; therefore that light and
   teaching which conveyeth blessedness is such as prevaileth upon the
   heart, and doth effectually turn us to God.

   6. It is not only an affront put upon God, but also a great wrong, to
   neglect the word of God, and the way he prescribes, and to seek
   blessedness in temporal things.

   Here you have the true way to blessedness set down in God's statutes;
   but in outward things there wants fulness, sincerity, eternity.

   [1.] There wants fulness. That which makes us blessed, it must fill up
   the heart of man. As a vessel is never full until it have as much as it
   can hold, so we can never be said to have a full happiness and
   contentment until we have as much as we can hold. That which fills must
   be greater than the thing filled. Now man's heart is such a chaos of
   desires, that it can never be filled up but in God: Ps. xvi. 11, In thy
   presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand are pleasures for
   evermore.' Therefore, of the joy and happiness we have in God, it is
   said, Enter into thy master's joy,' Mat. xxv. When we speak of a cup of
   water, that enters into the man, that is taken down into the man; but
   if we speak of a river of water, or tub of water, that is greater than
   the man is capable of, or can receive,--the man enters into it; so this
   joy and happiness, which is truly and genuinely so, it must exceed our
   capacity, greater than we can receive, that we may enter into it; it is
   the infinite God can only satisfy the heart of man. In temporal things
   there is no kind of fulness; you have not one worldly comfort, but you
   desire more of it. Ahab was a king, yet still he wants something,
   Naboth's vineyard. A man is not satisfied with abundance, neither is
   his soul filled with increase of worldly things; yet we may desire
   more, Eccles. v.; and if we have one thing to the full, yet we shall
   need another. If a man be strong, he may need learning; it may be
   though he hath some kind of learning and know ledge, yet he hath not
   wisdom. Naaman was rich, wise, valiant, and honourable, but he was a
   leper. There is a but upon all worldly happiness; therefore there is no
   fulness in these things.

   [2.] There is no sincerity in them. All that is in the world is but a
   semblance and an appearance, that which tickles the senses; it doth not
   go to the heart. You would have thought Belshazzar was merry at the
   heart when he was quaffing and carousing in the cups of the temple; but
   how soon is the edge of his bravery taken off, Dan. v. 5, 6. Haman in
   the midst of his honours was troubled at the heart for want of
   Mordecai's knee. Those things which seem to affect us so much cannot
   allay one unquiet passion, certainly cannot still and pacify the least
   storm of the conscience; and therefore, whatever face men put upon
   temporal enjoyments, if they cannot see God's special love m them, they
   want sincere joy. There is many a smart lash they feel when the world
   hears not the stroke: Prov. xiv. 13, Even in laughter the heart is
   sorrowful, and the end of that mirth is heaviness.' All the laughter
   and merriment which men seem to receive from the creature, it is but a
   little appearance, not such as will go to the conscience, that will
   indeed and thoroughly rejoice and comfort a man, and give him solid
   joy.

   [3.] There wants eternity. An immortal soul must have an eternal good,
   pleasures for evermore,' Ps. xvi. 11. In this world we have but a poor
   changeable happiness: Luke xii. 20, it was said to the rich fool, This
   night thy soul shall be required of thee.'

   Thus much for the first branch, blessed art thou, O Lord.

   Secondly, I come from the compellation to the supplication, teach me
   thy statutes. And here observe (1.) The person teaching; he speaks to
   God, Do thou, O God, teach,' (2.) We may consider the person taught,
   Teach me;' I, that have hid the word in my heart. David, that was a
   prophet, is willing to be a disciple. Those that teach others have need
   that God should teach them. The prophet saith, Teach me, O Lord.'
   David, a grown Christian, he desires more understanding of God's will.
   Certainly we should still follow on to know the Lord,' Hosea vi. 3.
   Heathens, that only knew natural and moral things, yet they saw a need
   of growth; and the more they knew, the more they discovered their
   ignorance; and always as they grew older, they grew wiser. How much
   more sensible would they have been of their defects in the knowledge of
   spiritual things, if they had in a little measure been acquainted with
   the mysteries of godliness, that pass all understanding, and are so
   much from human sense, and above the capacities of our reason! Prov.
   xxx. 3, Agur said, I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of
   the holy.' There is very much yet to be learned of God, and of his
   ways. Many think they know all that can be taught them. David, a great
   prophet, a man after God's own heart, yet is earnest that God would
   teach him his statutes. (3.) The lesson or matter to be taught, thy
   statutes;' so he calls the word, because the doctrines of it have the
   force of a law published; they do unalterably bind, and that the soul
   and conscience; and therefore the precepts, counsels, and doctrines of
   the word are all called statutes.

   The point is--

   Doct. If we would know God's statutes so as to keep them, we must be
   taught of God.

   Here I shall inquire--

   1. What it is, or how doth God teach us?

   2. The necessity of this teaching.

   3. The benefit and utility of it.

   First, How doth God teach us?

   Outwardly, by his ordinance, by the ministry of man.

   Inwardly, by the inspiration and work of the Holy Ghost.

   1. The outward teaching is God's teaching, because it is an ordinance
   which is appointed by him. Now both these must ever go together,
   external and internal teaching: Despise not prophecy, quench not the
   Spirit.' If you would have any enlightening and quickening of the
   Spirit, you must not despise prophecy. We teach you here, and God
   blesseth. Jesus Christ, when he comes to teach his disciples, first he
   openeth the scripture, Luke xxiv. 37; and then, ver. 45, he opened
   their understandings.' Of Lydia it is said, God opened her heart in
   attending to the things spoken by Paul,' Acts xvi. 14. She was
   attending, and then God openeth her heart. When the eunuch was reading,
   then God sends an interpreter. The outward means are necessary; it is
   God's teaching in part; but the inward grace especially. Both these
   must go together; for it is said, John vi. 45, Every man that hath
   heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.' There must be a
   hearing of the word, and so there is a teaching from God. But--

   2. The inward teaching, which is the work of the Spirit, that needs
   most to be opened. What is that? It consists in two things--(1.) When
   God infuseth light into the understanding, so as we come to apprehend
   the things of God in a spiritual manner: Ps. xxxvi. 9, In thy light
   shall we see light.' There is no discerning spiritual things
   spiritually, but in God's light. There may be a literal instruction
   which one man may give to another, but in thy light only shall we see
   light;' such a lively affective knowledge as disposeth the heart for
   the enjoyment of God. There is a seeing, and a seeing in seeing: Isa.
   vi. 10, Lest in seeing they shall see.' A man may see a truth
   rationally that' doth not see it spiritually. Now, when we have the
   Spirit's light, then in seeing we see. Or, as the apostle calls it,
   Col. i. 6, A knowing of the grace of God in truth,' since you did not
   only take up the report, but feel it, and had some experience of it in
   your hearts. Again, (2.) God's teaching consisteth not only in
   enlightening the understanding, but in moving and inclining the heart
   and the will; for God's teaching is always accompanied with drawing:
   John vi. 44, No man cometh to me, except the Father draw him;' which
   Christ proves, ver. 45, because they shall be all taught of God.' The
   Spirit's light is not only directive, but persuasive; it is effectual
   to alter and to change the affections, and to carry them out to Christ
   and to his ways; he works powerfully where he teacheth. When the Holy
   Ghost was first poured out upon the apostles, there was a notable
   effect of it; it came in the appearance of cloven tongues, like as of
   fire, Acts ii. 3, to show the manner of the Spirit's operation by the
   ministry; not only as light, but as fire: it is a burning and a shining
   light; that is, such a light as is seasoned with zeal and love, that
   affects the heart, that burns up our corruptions. And therefore, you
   know, when Christ would put forth a divine effect in his conference
   with his two disciples, it is said, Their hearts burned within them
   while he talked with them,' Luke xxiv. 32. There is a warmth and heat
   conveyed to the soul. Thus for the nature of this teaching.

   Secondly, The necessity of this teaching will appear in several things.

   1. If we consider the weakness of a natural understanding: 1 Cor. ii.
   14, The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God,
   because they are spiritually discerned.' They must be spiritually
   understood. There must be a cognation and proportion between the object
   and the faculty. Divine things cannot be seen but by a divine light,
   and spiritual things by a spiritual light, else they shall have no
   savour and relish. Can sense, which is the light of beasts, trace the
   workings or the flights of reason? Can you see a soul or an angel by
   the light of a candle? There is no proportion between them. So, can a
   natural man receive the things of the Spirit? He receives them not.
   Why? Because spiritual things must be spiritually discerned.

   2. There is not only blindness, but obstinacy and prejudice. When we
   come to judge by sense and reason, the whole business of Christianity
   seems to be a foolish thing to a carnal heart. To give up ourselves to
   God, and all our interests, and to wait upon the reversion of a
   happiness in another world, which is doubtful whether there will be any
   such thing or no, is a folly to him. To deny present lusts and
   interests, to be much in prayer, and be often in communion with God, is
   esteemed a like folly. When the apostle came to preach the gospel to
   the wits at Athens, they scoffed at him; they entertain his doctrine as
   fire is entertained in wet wood, with hissing and scorn. To do all, and
   suffer all, and that upon the account of a happiness to come, to a
   carnal heart this is but a fancy and a mere imagination.

   3. As blind and obstinate, so we are apt to abuse truth. Carnal hearts
   turn all to a carnal purpose. As spiders assimilate and turn, all they
   suck into their own substance, so doth a carnal heart turn all, even
   the counsels and comforts of the word, to a carnal purpose. Or as the
   sea, whatever comes into it, the sweet rivers and droppings of the
   clouds, turns all into salt water: Hosea xiv. 9, Who is wise, and he
   shall understand these things; prudent, and he shall know them; but the
   transgressors shall stumble therein.' As right excellent and as notable
   as the doctrines of the word are, yet a carnal heart finds matter in
   them to stumble at; he picks that which is an occasion of ruin and
   eternal perdition from the scripture; therefore the apostle saith, Eph.
   iv. 21, If ye have learned of him as the truth is in Jesus.' We are
   never right, and truth never works us to regeneration, but it is only
   fuel for our lusts, until we have learned it as it is in Jesus. Carnal
   men undo themselves by their own apprehensions of the truths of God.
   Luther calls some promises bloody promises, because of the mistakes of
   carnal men by their perverse application. Therefore, that we may
   maintain an awe of God in our soul, we need to be taught of God.

   4. We are apt to abuse our knowledge. Saving knowledge makes us more
   humble, but carnal knowledge more proud. Where it is in gift rather
   than in grace, there men are puffed up. The more we know God or
   ourselves by a divine light, the more humble we shall be: Jer. xxxi.
   18, 19, When I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh; I was ashamed,
   even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.' The more
   light we have from God, the more we look into a vile heart. When Adam's
   eyes are opened, he runs into the bushes; he was ashamed. So when God
   opens the eyes, and teacheth a Christian, this makes him more humble.

   5. There needs God's teaching, because we are so apt to forsake when we
   have known the things of God: Ps. cxix. 21, The proud do err from thy
   commandments.' What is the reason David was so stead fast in the truth?
   He did not take it up from the teachings of man, but from the teachings
   of God. When a man leads us into any truth, another man may lead us out
   again. But now, when God hath taught us, and impressed truth upon the
   heart, then it is durable. What is the reason believers are not as
   fickle as others, and not led away by the impure Gnostics, and like
   those libertines now among us? 1 John ii. 20, Ye have an unction from
   the Holy One, and ye know all things.' They had an unction which came
   down from Jesus Christ upon their hearts; and then a man is not led
   away by every fancy, but begins to grow stable in spirit.

   6. We cannot tell how to master our corruptions, nor restore reason to
   its dominion again. It is not enough to bring light into the soul, but
   we must have power and efficacy, or true conversion will not follow.
   Man's reason was to govern his actions. Now, all literal instruction is
   weak, like a March sun, which draweth up the vapours, but cannot
   scatter them; it can discover sins, but cannot quell them: Rom. vii. 9,
   When the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.' He could not tell
   how to bridle his lusts; he found them more outrageous: The good that I
   would do, I do not; and the evil which I would not, that I do.'

   Thirdly, The benefit and utility of God's teaching. When God teacheth,
   truth cometh upon us with more conviction and demonstration, 1 Cor. ii.
   6, and so hath a greater awe and sovereignty. Those that have made any
   trial can judge between being taught of God and men. Those that are
   taught of men, the charms of rhetoric may sometimes stir up some loose
   affection, but it doth soon vanish and wear away again; but the work of
   God makes deep impression upon the soul, and truths are then more
   affective. Man's knowledge is sapless, dry, and unsavoury: 2 Peter i.
   8, For if these things be in you and abound, they make you that ye
   shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
   Jesus Christ.' There may be an empty belief, and a naked and inactive
   apprehension of Christ, which stirs up no affection; but the light
   which comes from God enters upon the heart, Prov. ii. 10; it affects
   the whole soul. It doth not only stay in the fancy, float in the brain,
   but affect the heart. And then it is renewing. Man's light may make us
   more learned but God's light more holy. We are changed by beholding the
   glory of God into the same image,' 2 Cor. iii. 18.

SERMON XIV.

   With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.--Ver. 13.

   FOR the coherence of these words, you may refer them either to the 11th
   or 12th verse. If to the 11th verse, there he speaks of hiding the word
   in his heart, and now it breaks out in his tongue. First it must be in
   the heart, and next in the tongue. First in the heart. It is but
   hypocrisy to be speaking and talking of good things, when we have not
   been refreshed and warmed by them ourselves. Christianity is not a
   religion to talk of, but to live by. There are many rotten-hearted
   hypocrites that are all talkers; like the moon, dark in themselves,
   whatever light they give out to others; or like negroes, that dig in
   rich mines, and bring up gold for others, when themselves are poor. The
   power of grace in the heart is a good foundation for grace on the lips.
   This is the method and order wherein David expresseth it: I have hidden
   thy word in my heart;' and then, With my lips have I declared,' &c. And
   as it must be first in the heart, so next in the tongue. John vii. 38,
   Christ speaks of him that believeth in him, that out of his belly shall
   flow rivers of living water.' By the belly is meant the heart. When
   there is true grace in the heart, the sweet influences thereof will
   flow forth in their common discourse for the refreshing of others; as a
   spring sendeth forth the streams to water the ground about it. If the
   heart be full, the tongue will drop what is savoury. I say, certainly
   if it be within, it will break out. The word is to be hid, but not like
   a talent in a napkin, but like gold in a treasury, to be laid out upon
   all meet occasions. Thus referring it to the 11th verse, there may be a
   fair connection.

   Or if you refer it to the 12th verse, Blessed art thou, O Lord: teach
   me thy statutes:' teach me that I may teach others. Our requests for
   knowledge are like to speed when we are willing to exercise this
   knowledge for the glory of God and the good of others. Talents thrive
   by their use: To him that hath shall be given,' Mat. xxv. 29; that is,
   to him that useth his talents. Trading brings increase; and so it may
   be used as an argument to back that petition, Lord, teach me; for I
   have been ever declaring with my lips all the judgments of thy mouth.

   Again, none can speak of God with such savour and affection as he that
   is taught by God: Teach me, and I have or will declare (it may be read
   either may) all the judgments of thy mouth. A heathen could say, Non
   loquendum de Deo sine lumine--we must not speak of God without light.
   The things of God are best represented with the light of his own grace.
   David shows that he would perform the duty of a good disciple; that he
   would teach others if God should teach him.

   In the words two things are to be explained--

   1. What he will declare, all the judgments of thy mouth.

   2. In what sense he will declare them.

   First, What he will declare. God's will, revealed in the scripture, is
   called The judgments of his mouth,' his judgments. I have showed that,
   ver. 7, at large. Briefly now I will add two reasons: First, Because it
   is the rule according to which we must judge of all spiritual truth:
   Isa. viii. 20, To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not
   according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.'
   Secondly, It is the rule according to which we must look to be judged
   both here and hereafter. Here, I will chastise them (or judge them) as
   their congregation hath heard,' Hosea vii. 12. According to the
   sentence of the word, so will the course of his providence be, and
   according to which we shall be judged hereafter: John xii. 48, The word
   that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.' God's
   providences are a comment upon the scriptures. The scripture is not
   only a record of what is past, but a calendar and prognostication of
   what is to come. You may read your doom, your judgment there; for the
   statutes of the Lord are all called judgments, because of an answerable
   proceeding in the course of God's providence: if men escape here, they
   will not escape the judgment of the last day, when the sentence of that
   God shall infallibly be made good. Now, the verdict of the word is
   called the judgments of his mouth, as if God himself had pronounced by
   oracle, and judged from heaven in the case; and these judgments of his
   mouth the Psalmist saith shall be the matter of his discourse and
   conference with others.

   Secondly, In what sense it is said that he will declare all the
   judgments of his mouth. In this speech David may be considered as a
   king, as a prophet, or as a private believer.

   1. As a king; so some conceive that whenever he judged or gave sentence
   upon the throne, he would declare the judgments of God's mouth; that
   is, decree in the case according to the sentence of the law. In favour
   of this sense it may be alleged--

   [1.] That certainly the king was bound to study the law of God, as you
   shall see, Deut. xvii. 18, 19, When he sitteth upon the throne of his
   kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book, out of
   that which is before the priests the Levites; and it shall be with him,
   and he shall read therein all the days of his life.' Every king was
   bound to have a copy of the law, the Rabbis say, written with his own
   hand, carried about with him wheresoever he went, in city or camp.

   [2.] That the kings of Judah were bound up by the judicials of Moses,
   out of that which is before the priests and Levites;' that is,
   according to thy judicial laws, so will I pass sentence upon
   malefactors.

   [3.] That, proceeding according to this rule, their declarations in
   court were the judgments of God's mouth: 2 Chron. xix. 6, He said to
   the judges, Take heed what ye do; for ye judge not for man but for the
   Lord, who is with you in the judgment.' If this sense did prevail, we
   might observe hence, that a godly man useth the word to season the
   duties of all his relations. And again, that a good magistrate is so to
   judge upon the throne that his sentences there may be as the judgments
   of God's own mouth. But that which caused this misconceit was the word
   judgments, which is not of such a limited import and signification as
   those that pitched upon this interpretation did conceive, and therefore
   mistook the meaning of this place.

   2. David may be considered here as a prophet, and so a pattern of all
   teachers. He asserts his sincerity in two respects--(1.) As to the
   matter of his doctrine; it should be the judgments of God's mouth, such
   as he had received from God. (2.) As to the extent; that he would
   declare all the judgments of his mouth.

   [1.] As to the matter of his doctrine, it should be the judgments of
   his mouth. That which should be declared and taught in the church
   should not be our own opinions and fancies, but the pure word of God;
   not the vanity of our thoughts, but the verity of his revelations;
   otherwise we neither discharge our duty to God, nor to the children of
   God. Not to God, when we come in his name without his message: Jer. iv.
   10, Ah Lord! thou hast greatly deceived this people,' saith the prophet
   Jeremiah to God. Thou hast done it; because the false prophets had done
   it in his name. The dishonour reflects upon him when his ordinance is
   abused to countenance the fancies of our own brain. Nor to the children
   of God, whose appetite carrieth them to pure unmixed milk: 1 Peter ii.
   2, As new-born babes desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may
   grow there by,' logikon adolon gala--unmixed milk. The more natural the
   milk is, and without any mixture, the more kindly to a gracious ap
   petite. To mix it with sugar, and the luscious strains of a human wit,
   doth but disguise it, and hide it from a spiritual taste. But to mix it
   with lime, as Jerome saith of heretics, makes it baneful and noxious^
   Thus he speaks of his faithfulness as a prophet, a public teacher in
   the church.

   [2.] As to the extent; all the judgments of thy mouth, without adding
   or diminishing. No part of God's counsel must be forborne, either out
   of fear or favour. Our work is not to look what will please or
   displease, but what is commanded: Acts xx. 27, I have not shunned to
   declare the whole counsel of God.' If it be the counsel of God, let it
   succeed how it will, it must be spoken. So David here, all the
   judgments of thy mouth.

   3. David may be considered as a private Christian; and so, I. would
   declare all the judgments of thy mouth in a way of conference and
   gracious discourse. This is the sense I shall manage. The consideration
   I shall insist upon is this:--

   Doct. It concerns all that fear God to declare upon meet occasions the
   judgments of his mouth.

   How? In the way of public teaching? Shall every one that hath,
   knowledge and parts teach? I answer--No. There are some separate for
   that work: Acts xiii. 2, Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the
   work whereunto I have called them.' Paul and Barnabas were gifted and
   called by the Spirit, yet were to be solemnly authorised by prophets
   and teachers at Antioch, by officers of the church.

   Was it not enough that they were called by the Holy Ghost? What can man
   add more?

   There must be order in the church. Though they were called, yet they
   were to be ordained, and to have a solemn commission. It is true, all
   Christians are prophets, yet they are not to invade the office
   ministerial; as they are also all kings, yet they are not to usurp the
   magistracy, or to disturb the ruler in his government. If Christians
   would but meditate more, and see how much they have to do to preach to
   their own hearts; if they would but regard the unquestionable duty that
   they owe to their families more, this itch of public preaching would be
   much abated, and many other confusions and disorders among us would be
   prevented; and they would sooner find the Lord's blessing upon
   interchangeable discourse, gracious conferences, than this affectation
   of sermoning and set discourses.

   Well, then, we are to declare the judgments of his mouth, not by way of
   public teaching, but by way of private conference, edifying others, and
   glorifying God by the knowledge and experience that we have--

   First, In our own families.

   Secondly, In our converses.

   1. In our own families, in training up children and servants in the way
   of the Lord, and inculcating the doctrine of God upon them. This is a
   commanded duty, as you may see, Deut. vi. 6, 7, And these words which I
   command thee this day shall be in thine heart.' What then?' And thou
   shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them
   when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and
   when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.' Morning and evening,
   rising up and lying down, at home and abroad, they should be
   instructing their families. When the word of God is in the heart, thus
   it will break out. And chap, xi. 19, you have the same again. This is a
   duty God reckoneth upon, that you will not omit such a necessary piece
   of service: Gen. xviii. 19, I know Abraham, that he will command his
   children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of
   the Lord.' God promiseth himself, that from Abraham and his family he
   should have respect. God hath made many great promises to Abraham, as
   he doth now to all believers; but if you would have him bring upon you
   that which he hath spoken, you must not disappoint him. The seasoning
   of youth betimes in your families is a very great advantage. The family
   is the seminary of the church and state; and usually those that are
   ill-bred in the family, they prove ill when they come abroad. A fault
   in the first concoction is not mended in the second; and therefore here
   you should be declaring the mind and counsel of God to them. Many that
   afterwards prove eminent instruments of God's glory will bless you for
   it to all eternity. It is the best love you can express to your
   children, when you take care to season them with the best things. A
   husband is charged to love his wife. How shall he express this love?
   Eph. v. 25, 26, Even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself
   for it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it,' &c. I suppose the
   degree is not only commended for a pattern, but the kind; it must be
   such a love as Christ bore to his church: He gave himself for her, that
   he might sanctify her.' It must be such a love as tends to
   sanctification. It is a poor kind of love parents express to their
   children in providing great estates and portions for them, or bringing
   them up in trades that they may thrive in the world. But when you train
   them up for heaven, there is the best love: Prov. iv. 3, 4, For I was
   my father's son' (he was the darling) , tender and only beloved in the
   sight of my mother.' And wherein was that love expressed? He taught me
   also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words; keep my
   commandments and live.' So for servants; it is not enough to provide
   bodily maintenance for them--so we would do for the beasts if we would
   use their strength and service; but we are to instruct them according
   to our talents. And that is the best love we can show, to provide for
   their souls.

   2. In our converses, speaking of God and of his word in all companies,
   instructing the ignorant, warning and quickening the negligent,
   encouraging the good, casting out some savoury discourse wherever we
   come. So Ps. xxxvii. 30, The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom,
   and his tongue talketh of judgment.' A good man studieth in his
   speeches to glorify God, to edify those he speaks to: I will declare
   thy judgments,' saith David. Wise and gracious discourse drops from
   him. So Cant. iv. 11, Thy lips, my spouse, drop as the honeycomb; honey
   and milk are under thy tongue.' The passages of that song are to be
   understood in a spiritual sense. Now the lips and the^ tongue being
   instruments of speech, and milk and honey things by which the word is
   expressed, I suppose it is meant of a conference; and because the word
   of God is compared to milk and honeycomb, it shows that their
   conference should be gracious and edifying. This is that which drops
   from a sanctified mouth.

   For the reasons of this:--

   1. I shall argue from the interest which God hath in the lips and
   tongue, and therefore they must be used for God. He made them, bought
   them, and, if we belong to him, we gave them up with other things to
   him. We did not reserve our tongues. When we resigned and surrendered
   ourselves to the Lord's use, we did not make exception. The same
   argument which holds good for the whole body, why it should be
   possessed in sanctification and honour, holds good for every part of
   it: 1 Cor. vi. 20, Ye are bought with a price, therefore glorify God in
   your bodies, and in your spirits, which are God's.' Thy whole is God's,
   thy spirit, thy body, and every part; thy wit, strength, hand, tongue,
   all are God's; and therefore he expects to be glorified by thy tongue.
   They were rebels that said, Ps. xii. 4, Our lips are our own; who is
   lord over us?' There is nothing we have that is ours, but God's. Our
   hearts are not our own, to think what we will; nor our tongues our own,
   to speak what we will. God expects service from the tongue, otherwise
   we must be answerable for it when our sovereign Lord calls us to an
   account. Now, it is strange God should have so clear a right to our
   speech and language, and yet so little a share therein: Give unto
   Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are
   God's.' Thy tongue and thy lips, whose are they? If thou couldst make
   thy tongue of thyself, then thou mightst use it for thyself; but since
   you had it from God, you must use it for God. But, alas I how little
   are men mindful of this I Follow them all the day, you get not one word
   of God from them; they use their tongues as if they were their own, not
   God's.

   2. It is the glory of the tongue to serve God in this kind. It is the
   most excellent member in the body when it is well used for the glory of
   God and edification of others; therefore called our glory often in the
   psalms: Awake, my glory;' that is, my tongue; and what is glory in the
   Old Testament is rendered tongue in the New, Acts ii. Our tongue is our
   glory. Why? Because we have this advantage by it, we may speak for God:
   Therewith bless we God,' James iii. 9. The benefit of speech is our
   privilege above angels and beasts. Angels they have reason, but no
   tongues; and beasts they have tongues, but no reason to guide them and
   act them. But now we have tongues and reason both, that we may declare
   our maker's praise. Surely this member and instrument was not given us
   to savour meats and drinks--that is not the highest use of it--but to
   express the sense and affections of the mind; not to utter vain,
   frothy, frivolous things what an abuse is that!--but to comfort and
   instruct one another in the things of God. It is our glory.

   3. Every creature hath a voice like itself, and therefore so should the
   new creature have. The ox bellows, the ass brayeth, goats and sheep may
   be known by their bleat, and so is a man by the tenor of his discourse.
   As the constitution of the mind is, so are the words. A wicked man hath
   a vain heart, and therefore his discourse is idle and frivolous: Prov.
   x. 20, The tongue of the just is as choice silver, but the heart of the
   wicked is little worth.' The antithesis shows it should have been said,
   The tongue of the wicked is little worth;' but he would point at the
   cause of it, the heart of the wicked.' There is a quick intercourse
   between the tongue and the heart. Now, because the heart of the wicked
   is nothing worth, all his thoughts and musings are vain; he goes
   grinding chaff in his mind all the day; his mind, like a mill, is
   always at work, not upon corn, that it might be bread for his soul, but
   upon chaff; therefore, because his heart is nothing worth, his tongue
   is nothing worth. The tongue of the just is as choice silver, it brings
   in a great deal of treasure. But take a wicked man, all the workings of
   his heart, his thoughts and discourses, when summed up together, the
   product and total sum at night is nothing but vanity: The Lord seeth
   all their thoughts are but vain.' A vain heart will have vain speeches,
   and so a cankered sinner will have cankered discourse, as a putrid
   breath discovereth rotten lungs. Every man's speech is as his humour
   is. Come to a covetous person, he will be discoursing of farms, oxen,
   bargains, wares, and such like. Come to an epicurean gallant, to a
   voluptuary, and he will be telling you of horses, games, dogs, meats,
   drinks, merry company. Go to the ambitious, they will be talking of
   honours, offices, and the like. As they are of the flesh, so their talk
   savours of fleshly things. Every man hath a voice like himself, he
   speaks according to the constitution of his mind. Go to the
   discontented man, he will be talking of his adversaries, telling of
   affronts, wrongs, and public offences received. But a godly man hath a
   voice too like himself; he will be declaring the judgments of God's
   mouth; he will be speaking out of the word of God, of things within his
   sphere, and suitable to his kind: Mat. xii. 35, A good man out of the
   good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things.' Still the tap
   runs according to the liquor with which the vessel is filled, and a
   man's speech bewrays him of what kind he is; and therefore, since every
   creature hath a voice like himself, so should the new creature have.

   4. I shall argue from the nature of good, which is communicative, and
   loves to propagate itself--omne bonum sui diffusivum: Luke xxii. 32,
   Thou being converted, strengthen thy brethren.' He had had experience
   of a changeable heart; now go strengthen others. Fire turneth all
   things about it into fire; leaven pierceth through the whole lump. So
   grace seeks to propagate and diffuse itself. Therefore, when the work
   of God is written upon a man's mind and laid up in his heart, he will
   be declaring and speaking of it to others. Naturalists observe that
   mules and creatures which are of a mongrel race do not procreate after
   their kind; so the false Christians are not for propagating and
   enlarging Christ's interest; they are not so warm, spiritual, and
   heavenly in their discourses. Andrew, when acquainted with, Christ,
   calls Peter, and both call Nathanael: John i. 41-45, We have found the
   Messiah,' John calls his disciples. As a hen, when she hath found a
   worm or a barleycorn, clucks for her chickens that they may come and
   partake of it with her, so a man acquainted with Christ, who hath
   tasted that the Lord is gracious, he cannot hold; he will be calling
   upon his friends and relations to come and share with him of the same
   grace. As they have more of God, they will improve it for the comfort
   of others, and are willing to take hold of all opportunities to this
   end.

   5. It discovereth plenty of knowledge and a good esteem of the word.
   (1.) Plenty of knowledge, when it is so apt to break out. When these
   living waters run out of the belly, it is a sign of a good spring
   there: Col. iii. 16, Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all
   wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another.' It is a sign we have
   gotten the riches of understanding; for out of the abundance of the
   heart the mouth speaketh. So Prov. xvi. 23, The heart of the wise
   teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips.' When our speech
   hath weight and worth in it, and we are ready upon all occasions, it
   argueth a good stock of the word. You know a man that puts his hand in
   his pocket, and brings up gold at every draught, it is a sign he hath
   more plenty of it than silver; so when we are ready to bring out
   gracious discourses, it argueth a treasure and stock within. (2.) It
   argueth a good esteem of the word. Things that are dear and precious to
   us, we use to discourse of them. What we love, admire, and affect, the
   tongue will be occupied about such things: John iii. 31, He that is of
   the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth;' and 1 John iv. 5,
   They are of the world, therefore speak they of the world.' I know it is
   spoken in the first place of ordinary teachers. All men, whose original
   is of the earth, they savour of it in their speech; when they speak of
   divine things, there is some earthiness in it. The other scripture is
   meant of false teachers, they savour of the world, all their teaching
   doth savour of their affections. But both places give this general
   truth: What a man's affections are upon, it is most ready in his mouth.
   Therefore it argueth we are affected with the word of God when we are
   declaring it upon all occasions.

   6. It is for our benefit to be talking of good things to others. The
   breasts that are not sucked do soon grow dry, but the more they are
   milked out and drawn, the greater is the increase; so in spiritual
   things, we gain by communicating; by discourse, truths are laid more in
   view. We find in any art of common learning, the more we confer about
   things with others, the more understanding we get ourselves: Prov. xi.
   25, The liberal soul shall be made fat; and he that watereth shall be
   watered also himself.' It is spoken of alms; it is true of spiritual
   alms, as plain experience shows. By watering and refreshing others, the
   more are we comforted and refreshed ourselves. The loaves were
   increased in the dividing. Solomon compares conference to the whetting
   iron upon iron; the more one iron is whetted upon another, both are
   sharpened; so by conference our gifts are increased. Earthly goods, the
   more they are given out, we have the less in view and visible
   appearance, though God can increase them; but now, in heavenly and
   spiritual things, in the very giving out to others, they are increased
   upon our hands.

   Use 1. To shame us for our unprofitableness in our relations and
   converses; for these are two things wherein a Christian should take
   occasion to declare the judgments of God's mouth.

   1. In our relations, that we do no good there in declaring the
   judgments of God's mouth to one another. Surely every relation is a
   talent, and you will be accountable for it, if you do not improve it
   for your master's use. The husband is to converse with his wife as a
   man of knowledge; 1 Peter iii. 7; and the wife to gain upon the
   husband, 1 Peter iii. 2; and both upon the children and servants. The
   members of every family should be helping one another in the way to
   heaven. With what busy diligence doth an idolatrous family carry on
   their way and their course! See Jer. vii. 18, The children gather wood,
   and the fathers kindle the fire,' &c., saith the Lord. Every one will
   have his hand in the work, and are quickening and inflaming one
   another. Fathers, children, husbands, wives, all find some employment
   or other about their idolatrous service. Oh, that every one would be as
   forward and zealous and helpful in the work of God! Oh, that we were as
   careful to train and set our families a-work in a course of godliness!
   Christians should reason thus: What honour hath God by making me a
   father, a master of a family? Every such an one hath a charge of souls,
   and he is to be responsible. It will be no grief of heart to you when
   by your means they become acquainted with God: Ye are my crown and my
   rejoicing,' says the apostle, of the Thessalonians converted by his
   ministry. It will be a crown of honour and rejoicing in the day of the
   Lord, when you have been instrumental, not only for their prosperity in
   the world, but of their increasing in grace.

   2. In our converses, how little do we edify one another! If Christ's
   question to the two disciples going to Emmaus were put to us: Luke
   xxiv. 17, What manner of conversation had you by the way?' what cause
   should we have to blush and be ashamed! Generally our discourse is
   either--(1.) Profane and sinful; there is too much of the rotten
   communication which the apostle forbids: Eph. iv. 29, Let no corrupt
   communication come out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use
   of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearer.' Rotten
   discourse argueth a rotten heart. Or, (2.) Idle and vain, as foolish
   tales. The apostle bids Timothy, 1 Tim. iv. 7, to refuse profane and
   old wives' fables,' or vain compliments,' though we are to give an
   account for idle words, Mat. xii. 36. Or else, like the Athenians, we
   spend our time in hearing and telling news,' Acts xvii. 21. Or we
   please and solace ourselves with frothy flashes of wanton wit, and
   jesting that is not convenient,' which the apostle forbids, Eph. v. 4.
   The praise of a Christian lieth not in the wittiness, but in the
   graciousness of his conversation. That which is Aristotle's virtue is
   made a sin with Paul--foolish jesting. You should rather be refreshing
   one another with what experiences you have had of the Lord's grace;
   that is the comfort and solace of Christians when they meet together.
   But when men wholly give up themselves to move laughter, all this is
   idle and vain discourse. It is not enough to say it doth no hurt, but
   what good doth it do? doth it tend to the use of edifying'? A Christian
   that hath God and Christ, and his wonderful and precious benefits to
   talk of, and so many occasions to give thanks, he cannot want matter to
   discourse of when he comes into company; therefore we should avoid vain
   discourse. Or, (3.) We talk of other men's matters or faults, as the
   apostle speaks of those, 1 Tim. v. 13, that wandered from house to
   house; that were not idle only, but tattlers also, and busybodies,
   speaking things which they ought not: Lev. xix. 16, Thou shalt not go
   up and down as a tale-bearer among thy people.' The Hebrew word
   signifies a merchant, or one that goeth about with spices to sell;
   thence the word is used for one that wandereth from place to place,
   uttering slanders as wares. These pedlars will always be opening their
   packs. Men fill up time by tattling and meddling with others: Thus have
   I heard of such or such an one. Or, (4.) our discourse is wholly of
   worldly business, not a word of God: They are of the earth, and speak
   of the earth,' John iii. 31. The habituating ourselves to worldly
   discourse together, without interposing something of God, is a great
   disadvantage. Or, (5.) vain jangling; if we speak of anything that hath
   an aspect upon religion, we turn it into a mere dispute about opinion;
   we do not use conferences as helps to gracious affections. How many are
   there sick of questions, as the apostle saith, and dote upon strife of
   words'? 1 Tim. vi. 4. Thus if we did put ourselves to question at
   night, What have I spoken? what good have I done? what good have I
   received from such company?--it would make the word more sensible and
   active upon our souls.

   Use 2. To press us to holy conference, both occasional and set.

   1. Occasional. We are not left at random in our ordinary discourse, to
   speak as we will; but at all times and with all persons we should have
   an eye to the good of those with whom we speak: Col. iv. 6, Let your
   speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye
   ought to answer every man.' In visits, walks, journeys, let your speech
   be always with grace. We should ever be drawing to good discourse, as
   remembering we must give account: James ii. 12, So speak as those that
   shall be judged by the law of liberty.' Certainly a gracious heart will
   thus do. He that doth not want a heart will not want in occasion of
   interposing somewhat for God. This was Christ's manner: Luke xiv. 15,
   when he was eating bread in the Pharisee's house, he discourseth,
   Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.' There will
   be a feast in heaven, when we shall sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and
   Jacob in the kingdom of God.' So when Christ was at Jacob's well, John
   iv. 14, he discourseth of the well of living waters which springeth up
   to eternal life'; still he draweth towards some gracious improvement of
   the occasion. So John vii. 37, when he was at the feast of tabernacles,
   and it was the custom there to fetch water from Siloa, and pour it out
   upon the altar of burnt-offerings--they were to make a flood of
   it--Christ improves it: If any man will come to me, out of his belly
   shall flow rivers of living water;' he spiritualiseth the occasion. If
   our hearts were as they ought to be, we would have a gracious word more
   ready; we would either be beginning or carrying on good conference
   where-ever we came. But Christians are to seek, either through
   barrenness or leanness of soul; they have not that good treasure or
   stock of knowledge in them, or through the custom of vain speech. And
   the great cause of all is the prevalency of an unsanctified and worldly
   heart; this hindereth us from being more fruitful in our converse.

   2. It should press us to holy conferences set. There may be, and should
   be, some set time for mutual edification. It is not the duty only of
   the ministers, but also of private Christians, keeping within the
   bounds of their station and the measures of their knowledge, to teach
   and to instruct one another. The scriptures are full of this: Col. iii.
   6; Col. i. 5-11; Heb. iii. 13; Jude 20. Christians should often meet
   together for prayer and spiritual edification. So Heb. x. 24, 25; Rom.
   xv. 14. I heap up these places because of the error of the Papists, who
   will not have the laity speak of scripture, or things pertaining to
   scripture. Whereas you see these injunctions are plain and clear, and
   it is a great part of that holy communion that should pass between
   saints, this mutual exhorting, quickening, and strengthening one
   another's hands in the work of the Lord. These places are not to be
   under stood of public communion, of church societies, but of private
   conferences, by way of interchangeable discourse and mutual
   edification. It is not necessary these set conferences should be
   always, and all the members of the church meet and confer together; but
   a company of savoury Christians, whose spirits suit best in commerce,
   and most likely to help one another. Though I am to love all the
   brotherhood, and carry a respect to all in relation to me, yet I am to
   single out for my advantage some of the most eminent, or the most
   suitable; for great regard is to be had to that. Christ made a
   distinction in his little flock, in his family, shall I call it; some
   he singleth out for more immediate converses, as Peter, James, and
   John, in his transfiguration, in Mat. xvii. 1, and in his agonies;
   these were the flower, the choice, that he singled out for his special
   converse. I speak not of public meetings, in public societies, but set
   conferences with gracious Christians with whom our spirits suit best,
   and are likely to be of greatest help in maintaining of the spiritual
   life. These set times the people of God have ever made conscience of.
   It is a great comfort and refreshing to be conscious to the exercise of
   each other's grace: Rom. i. 12, That I may be comforted together with
   you, by the mutual faith both of you and me.' And it is a mighty
   strengthening in evil times: Mal. iii. 16, Then they that feared the
   Lord spake often one to another, and the Lord hearkened and heard it.'
   And you will find the benefit of the manifold graces of God, that what
   one wants will be supplied by the help of another. God doth riot so
   give his gifts to one but that he needs others' help. Paul calls Aquila
   and Priscilla fellows or helpers in Christ Jesus;' and Apollos, a
   mighty man in the scriptures, had a great deal of help by Aquila and
   Priscilla, Rom. xvi. 3; 1 Cor. xii. 21, The eye cannot say unto the
   hand, I have no need of thee; nor the head to the feet, I have no need
   of you.' The meanest have their use, quickening and strengthening one
   another. This mutual edification differeth from ministerial or church
   society; because the one is an act of authority, the other of charity;
   the one in the face of the congregation, the other by a few Christians
   in private; and it may be improved to awaken each other to consider of
   God, of the ways of God, the word of God, the works of creation and
   providence, redemption, the judgments he executes in the world, mercies
   towards his people, the experiments and proofs of his grace in your
   Christian warfare: Ps. lxvi. 16, Come and hear, all ye that fear God,
   and I will declare what he hath done for my soul.' Ferus speaks of some
   old monks, Conveniebant in unum, audiebatur verbum Dei, &c.--they were
   wont to meet together, and after they had read the word of God, every
   one did acquaint one another with his weaknesses, with his temptations,
   and mutually asked counsel, and comforted one another out of the word
   of God; and after this they concluded all with prayer, and so every man
   went to his home. These examples, did we observe them, they would be
   most useful to us; we might drive on a trade to heaven, and be of very
   great profit in the spiritual life; if the gifts of private Christians
   were managed without pride, vainglory, and without despising of the
   weak, it would be of exceeding honour to God, use and comfort to the
   saints.

SERMON XV.

   I have rejoiced in the way of thy commandments, as much as in all
   riches.--Ver. 14.

   THESE words may respect the 12th verse, as another argument where with
   to back his request, Teach me thy statutes; for I have rejoiced in the
   way of thy commandments as much as in all riches.' Many are for worldly
   wealth, but I have other desires: Lord, teach me how to understand and
   keep thy statutes, and this will be a greater benefit than any worldly
   possession whatsoever. Or you may refer them to the 13th verse, as a
   reason of his practice; every man will be speaking of that wherewith he
   is delighted: Lord, thy testimonies are my rejoicing;' therefore, I
   have and will be speaking of them upon all occasions. Or this may be
   the fruit of what was mentioned before: those that are exercised about
   the word, the study, and practice of it, and conference about it, have
   a sweet sense of the goodness of it in their own souls, so as they
   delight and rejoice in it above all things; and if we have not felt
   this effect, it is because we are strangers to the word.

   In the words there is--

   1. A delight asserted.

   2. The object of it, in the way of thy testimonies.

   3. The degree of it, as much as in all riches.

   By way of explication: The testimonies' of God are his word, for it
   testifieth of his will. Now the prophet saith not only, I have rejoiced
   in thy testimonies,' but in the way of thy testimonies.' Way is one of
   the words by which the law is expressed. God's laws are ways that lead
   us to God; and so it may be taken here, the way which thy testimonies
   point out and call me unto; or else, his own practice, as a man's
   course is called his way; his delight was not in speculation or talk,
   but in obedience and practice: In the way of thy testimonies.' The
   degree, as much as in all riches.' As much, not to show the equality of
   these things, as if we should have the same affection for the world as
   for the word of God; but as much, because we have no higher comparison.
   This is that worldlings dote upon and delight in. Now, as much as they
   rejoice in worldly possessions, so much do I rejoice in the way of thy
   testimonies. For I suppose David doth not compare his own delight in
   the word with his own delight in wealth; but his own choice and delight
   with the delight and choice of others. If he had spoken of himself both
   in the one respect and in the other, the expression was very high.
   David, that was called to a crown, and in a capacity of enjoying much
   in the world, gold, silver, lands, goods, largeness of territory, and a
   compound of all that which all men jointly, and every man severally,
   doth possess, yet was more pleased in the holiness of God's ways, than
   in all the world.' For what shall it profit a man to gain the whole
   world, and lose his own soul?' Mat. xvi. 26.

   Doct. A gracious heart finds more true joy in the way of God's word
   than in all worldly things whatsoever.

   To explain this, consider--

   1. What this delight is.

   2. How a gracious heart finds more delight in the word of God than in
   all worldly things.

   3. The reasons why they do so,

   1. What this delight is. I shall give you several distinctions.

   [1.] There is a sweetness in the study of God's word, or when we give
   up ourselves to attain the knowledge of it. The very speculation and
   study produces a delightful taste, for three reasons:--

   (1.) Truth is the good of the understanding; therefore, when the
   faculty is suited with a fit object, this correspondence causeth a
   rejoicing and delectation: Prov. xxiv. 14, My son, eat thou honey
   because it is good; and the honeycomb, because it is sweet to thy
   taste: so shall the knowledge of wisdom be to thy soul when thou hast
   found it.' Every truth, if it be but a natural or philosophical verity,
   when we come to consider and see it with our own eyes, and have found
   it out by search, and do not repeat it by rote only, breedeth a
   delight. Pleasure is applicatio convenientis convenienti; so it is true
   in theological truths; we are the more affected with them the more they
   are represented with evidence to the soul.

   (2.) Scriptural truths are more sublime than other truths, and do en
   noble reason with the knowledge of them: Deut. iv. 6, Surely this great
   nation is a wise and an understanding people.' Such doctrines as we
   meet with in the word of God concerning angels and the souls of men,
   the creation and government of all things, the redemption of men, must
   needs affect the heart, and breed a joy in the view and contemplation
   of them.

   (3.) Because these truths are suitable to our necessities. To every man
   that hath a conscience, it cannot but be very pleasing to hear of a way
   how he may come to the pardon of sins, and sound peace of conscience,
   solid perfection, and eternal glory. Man is naturally under fear of
   death, Rom. i. 32, and would be glad of pardon; weak, and unable to
   find out or attain to moral perfection, he would be glad of an exact
   rule, and gropeth and feeleth about for an everlasting happiness, Acts
   xvii. 27. So far as anything is found to this purpose in the writings
   of men, they have a marvellous force and influence upon us. Any beam of
   this truth scattered in Plato or Socrates, of man's reconciliation with
   a just God, there is nothing in their writings; the then world was
   under perplexity; but yet of moral perfection, and an eternal state of
   blessedness, there were some glimmerings. Now, when these are
   represented to the understanding with such evidence and satisfaction as
   they are in the scriptures, where you have the only sufficient
   direction to true happiness, no wonder if they are greedily catched at.
   Now this delight, though good, I speak not of, because it may be in
   temporaries, who have a taste of the good word, to invite them to seek
   for more, Heb. vi. 4, and is a fruit of common illumination. The stony
   ground received the word with joy, Luke viii. 13; and though it may
   affect the heart, yet if not above all riches, it doth not prevail over
   carnal affections.

   [2.] There is a sweetness found in the way of God's testimonies which
   ariseth from the conscience of practical obedience, not from
   contemplation only; and it is best to be found when we come to practise
   and perform what we know. It is said of wisdom, Prov. iii. 17, All her
   ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.' There is
   not only a sweetness in our privileges, but in our duties. No man
   knoweth the contentment of walking closely with God but he that hath
   tried. So Micah ii. 7, Do not my words do good to him that walketh
   uprightly?' not only speak good, but do good. There is a certain
   performance of what the word saith, when it is said: it may be
   accounted done; but to whom? To them that know it, and are able to talk
   of it? No; but to them that walk. And will every slight endeavour and
   the presumption of conformity to the rule serve the turn? No; to them
   that walk uprightly, that sincerely frame themselves to obey God's will
   with the greatest exactness and care they can use. Oh, what good, what
   reviving of heart and cheerfulness do they find in this work! Briefly,
   this delight in the way of God's testimonies (that you may not be
   mistaken) differeth from that contentment and serenity of mind which is
   the fruit of integrity or moral sincerity. There is some degree of
   comfort that accompanieth any good action, as heat doth fire; the
   conscience, so far as he doth good, hath some kind of peace in it. The
   heathens by God's general bounty and goodness had a conscience excusing
   when they did good, as well as accusing when they did evil: Rom. ii.
   15, Their thoughts in the meantime accusing, or else excusing one
   another,' metaxu allelon--by turns,' and this excusing cannot be
   without some sweetness and contentment of mind. Sacer intra nos
   spiritus sedet bonorum malorumque nostrorum observator et custos; hic
   prout a nobis tractatus est, ita nos ipse tractat, saith Seneca. This
   may be without faith; whereas we speak of such a joy as is founded in
   faith, though found in the ways of obedience in Christ's service: Mat.
   xi. 29, Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly
   in heart, and ye shall find rest for your souls.' In short, there is
   delight in the duty and the dispensation; for it is both promised and
   required. Delight in God's ways is promised as a gift of God, and as
   the result of our obedience: Isa. lviii. 13, 14, If thou turn away thy
   foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day, and call
   the sabbath a delight, &c., then shalt thou delight thyself in the
   Lord,' &c.; and Cant. ii. 3, I sat down under his shadow with great
   delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.' There is sweetness God
   bestoweth, or sensible consolation, which must be distinguished from
   that delight which is a fruit of our gracious esteem. I can exclude
   neither, though that delight which is the fruit of our esteem of the
   word is principally here intended; the one is more durable than the
   other. A gracious affection to the word and ways of God should ever
   remain with us; but we are not always feasted with spiritual suavities.
   Now and then we have them, and when they have done their work they
   return to God. As in the vision made to Peter, the sheet that was
   showed him was received up again into heaven, Acts x. 16, when Peter
   was informed of God's will; so this comfort returneth to the giver when
   it hath done its work, refreshed our hearts, and engaged us to wait
   upon God.

   2. How a gracious heart rejoiceth more in the way of God's testimonies
   than in all riches.

   [1.] There is a broad difference in the things themselves, and
   therefore there should be in our affections to them; for our affections
   should be carried out according to the worth of things; otherwise, if
   an object of less worth have more of our hearts than an object of more
   value, they are like members out of joint, they are not in their proper
   place. There is a great distance between the things themselves, as much
   as there is between the enjoyment of God and the creature, and
   therefore there must be a considerable difference in our affections to
   them. If the difference be so nice that thou canst hardly distinguish
   which thy heart is more affected with, the enjoyment of God in the way
   of his testimonies, or the enjoyment of wealth and worldly
   accommodations, or if the disproportion be on the world's side, that
   hath more of thy esteem and complacency, then God is not thy chiefest
   good; thou lovest the creature more than God, which is inconsistent
   with grace: for this is the prime act of grace, to choose God for our
   chiefest good.

   [2.] We must distinguish between the sensitive stirring of the
   affections and the solid complacency of the soul. It is possible a
   child of God may be more sensibly moved by temporal things, as they do
   more strike upon the senses; but the supreme and prevailing delight of
   the soul is in spiritual things, in the way of God's testimonies. To
   exemplify this by the contrary affection, as in sorrow; a temporal loss
   may to sense more stir the affections, as to bodily expression of them,
   than a spiritual; as the drawing of a tooth or any present pain may
   make us cry out more than the languishings of a consumption; whereas
   the other may go nearer to the heart, and causeth a more lasting
   trouble. So in joy; a man may be pleased with earthly conveniences, and
   yet his solid esteem is more in spiritual things; as a trifle may
   provoke laughter more than a solid benefit that accrueth to us.
   Therefore the case is not to be decided by the intensiveness of the
   sensitive expression so much as by the appreciation of the soul. In
   this sense the point is to be understood; he would lose all the world
   rather than dispense with his obedience to God. This is selling all for
   the pearl of price spoken of, Mat. xiii. 46. All other things are
   trampled upon and renounced for this one's sake, that we may enjoy God
   in Christ. And truly this affection to the word is not easily to be
   found; for we often see that men for a little gain will break all the
   commandments of God, as things not to be stood upon when any temporal
   commodity is in chase, and in the pursuit of worldly riches care not
   how they neglect Christ and heavenly things.

   3. The reasons why they rejoice more in the way of God's testimonies
   than in all riches.

   [1.] Because of the suitableness of these things to the new nature.
   Everything hath a kind of joy when it enjoys that which is good for it.
   The ground doth pleasantly receive a shower of rain after drought; the
   natural man eateth and drinketh, and his heart is filled with gladness;
   so the spiritual man is affected with that which is agreeable to the
   divine nature. Everything is preferred according to the suitableness
   and proportion which it carrieth to our necessities and desires. The
   cock in the fable preferred a barleycorn before a jewel; the barley
   corn is more suitable to its natural appetite. So believers have not
   the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God,' 1 Cor. ii.
   12; therefore the way of God's testimonies is more suitable and
   proportion able to that nature which they have. Their wealth and
   worldly things they indeed suit with the sensitive nature, but that is
   kept under, therefore the prevalent inclination is to the word more
   than to the world.

   [2.] There is nothing in the enjoyment of worldly things, but they have
   it more amply in the exactest and sincerest way of enjoyment by the
   word, and walking in the way of its precepts. Satan's baits whereby he
   leads men to sin are pleasure and profit; when bonum honestum, the good
   of honesty and duty, is declined, there remains nothing but bonum utile
   et jucundum, the good of pleasure and profit. If we be moved with these
   things, it is good to look there where we may have them at the highest
   rate and in the most sincere manner. Now, it is the word of God
   believed and obeyed which yieldeth us the greatest profit and the
   greatest pleasure. You have both in one verse: Ps. xix. 10, More to be
   desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than
   the honey and the honeycomb.' Because of the profit it is compared to
   gold, and because of the sweetness and pleasure we have by it, it is
   compared to honey.

   The word of God will truly enrich a man and make us happy. The
   difference between God's people and others doth not lie in this, that
   the one seeketh after riches, the other not; they both seek to enrich
   themselves; only the one seeketh after false, and the other true
   riches, as they are called, Luke xvi. 11, and so differ from one
   another as we and the Indians do, who reckon their wealth by their
   wampenpeage, or shells of fishes, as we do ours by gold and silver; the
   one hath little worth but what their fancies put upon it; the other
   hath a value in nature. Or, to speak in a more home comparison,
   counters, glass beads, and painted toys please children more than
   jewels and things of greater price, yea, than land of inheritance, or
   whatever, when we come to man's estate, we value and is of use to us
   for the supply of present necessities. So worldly men, preferring their
   kind of wealth before holiness and the influences of grace, do but cry
   up baubles before jewels. To evidence this, and that we may beat the
   world with their own notions, and so the better defeat the temptation,
   let us consider what is the true riches.

   1. What is indeed true riches.

   2. Why these are the true riches.

   1. What is indeed riches.

   [1.] Gracious experiences or testimonies of the favour of God. He is a
   rich man indeed that hath many of these. So it is said, Rom. x. 12, God
   is rich to all that call upon him;' it is meant actively, not
   passively; it only noteth that God doth give out plentiful experiences
   of his grace.

   [2.] Knowledge: Let the word of God dwell in you richly, in all
   wisdom,' Col. iii. 16. And the apostle mentions the riches of the full
   assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment of the mystery of
   God, and of the Father, and of Christ,' Col. ii. 2. This is a treasure
   in deed, that cannot be valued; and he is a very poor soul that wants
   it.

   [3.] Faith: James ii. 5, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world,
   rich in faith?' He is a rich man that is emptied of himself that he may
   be filled with God.

   [4.] Good works: 1 Tim. vi. 10, Charge them that are rich in this
   world, that they be not high-minded, &c., but rich in good works,'
   miserable man! that hath nothing to reckon upon but his money and his
   bags, so much by the year, and makes it all his business to live
   plentifully in the world, laying up nothing for heaven, and is not rich
   in gracious experiences, knowledge, faith, and good works, which are a
   Christian s riches!

   2. Why are these the true riches?

   [1.] That is true riches which maketh the man more valuable, which
   gives an intrinsic worth to him, which wealth doth not that is without
   us. We would not judge of a horse by the richness of his saddle and the
   gaudiness of his trappings; and is man, a reasonable creature, to be
   esteemed by his moneys and lands, or by his graces and moral
   perfections?

   [2.] That is riches which puts an esteem upon us in the eyes of God and
   the holy angels, who are best able to judge, One barbarous Indian may
   esteem another the more he hath of his shells and trifles; but you
   would count him never the richer that should bring home a whole ships
   lading of these things: Luke xii. 20, such a fool is he that heapeth up
   treasure to himself, and is not rich towards God;' that hath not of
   that sort of riches which God esteemeth. We are bound for a country
   where riches are of no value; grace only goeth current in the other
   world.

   [3.] That is riches which steads us in our greatest extremities. When
   we come to die, the riches of this world prove false comforts, for they
   forsake a man when he hath most need of comfort. In the hour of death,
   when the poor shiftless naked soul is stripped of all, and we can carry
   away nothing in our hands, grace lieth near the heart to comfort us. It
   is said by a voice from heaven of those that die in the Lord, Their
   works follow them;' their wealth doth not. Our graces continue with us
   to all eternity.

   [4.] That is the true riches which will supply all our necessities, and
   bear our expenses to heaven. Wealth doth not this, but grace: Mat. vi.
   33, Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and the righteousness thereof,
   and all these things shall be added;' 1 Tim. iv. 8, Godliness is
   profitable unto all things, having the promise of the life that now is,
   and of that which is to come.' Heaven and earth are laid at the feet of
   godliness.

   [5.] That is true riches which will give us a title to the best
   inheritance. The word of God is able to enrich a man more than all the
   riches of the world, because it is able to bring a man to an
   everlasting kingdom. All this is spoken because there is an evil desire
   that possesseth the whole world; they are vehemently carried after
   riches, and as they are increased, so are they delighted. But, saith
   David, my delight is to increase in knowledge and grace; if I get more
   life, more victory over lusts, more readiness for God's service, this
   comforts me to the heart. Now how do you measure your thriving? by
   worldly or spiritual increase?

   Here is the true delight. Spiritual delight in spiritual objects far
   exceedeth all the joy that we can take in worldly things. The pleasures
   of the mind are far more pure and defecate than those of the body; so
   that if a man would have pleasures, let him look after the chiefest of
   the kind. He spoke like a beast rather than like a man that said, Eat,
   drink, and be merry; thou hast goods laid up for many years,' Luke xii.
   19. That is the most that worldly things can afford us, a little bodily
   cheer: Ps. xvii. 14, Thou hast filled their bellies with hid
   treasures;' there is the poor happiness of a rich world ling. He may
   have a bellyful, and fare at a better rate than others do: Hab. i. 16,
   Their portion is made fat, and their meat plenteous.' When men have
   troubled themselves and the world to make themselves great, it is but
   for a little belly-cheer, which may be wanted as well as enjoyed; a
   modest temperance and mean fare yieldeth more pleasure. But what is
   this to the delights of the mind? A sensualist is a fool, that runneth
   to such dreggy and carnal delights. Noble and sublime thoughts breed a
   greater pleasure. What pleasure do some take in finding out a
   philosophical verity!--the man rejoiceth, the senses are only tickled
   in the other. Of all pleasures of the mind, those of the spiritual life
   are the highest, for then our natural faculties are quickened and
   heightened by the Spirit. The reasonable nature hath a greater joy than
   the sensitive, and the spiritual divine nature hath more than the mere
   rational. There is not only a higher object, the love of God, but a
   higher cause, the Spirit of God, who elevateth the faculty to a higher
   manner of sense and perception. Therefore both the good and evil of the
   spiritual life is greater than the good and evil of the rational. The
   evil of the spiritual is greatest: A wounded spirit who can bear?' And
   the good of the spiritual life is greatest, joy unspeakable and
   glorious.' The higher the life, the greater the feeling; groans not
   uttered.' Peace passing all understanding,' though it maketh no loud
   noise, yet it diffuseth a solid contentment throughout the soul. All
   this is spoken because the way of God's testimonies is looked upon as a
   dark and gloomy course by carnal men; yet it is the life of the blessed
   God himself: Eph. iv. 18, Having the understanding darkened, being
   alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them,
   because of the blindness of their heart.' And surely he wants no true
   joy and pleasure that lives such a life.

   Use 1. Here is an invitation to men to acquaint themselves more with
   the way of God's testimonies, that they may find this rejoicing above
   all riches. It is hard to pleasant natures to abjure accustomed
   delights; and carnal men picture religion with a sour austere face: We
   shall never see cheerful day more if we are strict in religion. Oh!
   consider, your delight is not abrogated, but perfected; you shall find
   a rejoicing more intimate than in all pleasures. Cyprian saith he could
   hardly get over this prejudice, in his epistle to Donatus. Austin,
   thirty years old, parted with his carnal delights, and found another
   sweetness--quam suave mihi subito factum est! It is your disease maketh
   you carnal; when freed from the fervours of lust, these things will
   have no relish with you. If it seem laborious at first, it will be more
   joyful than all riches. The root is bitter, but the fruit sweet. At
   first it is bitter to nature, which loveth carnal liberty, to render
   itself captive to the word; but after a little pains, and when the
   heart is once subdued to God, it will be sweet and comfortable. Ask of
   the spies that have been in this good land if it be not a land flowing
   with milk and honey. David tells you, In the way of thy testimonies.'
   This way would be more trodden if men would believe this; if you will
   not believe, make trial; if Christ's yoke seem burdensome, it is to a
   galled neck.

   Use 2. Trial.

   1. Have we a delight in obedience to God's precepts? Ps. cxii. 1, they
   that fear God, delight greatly in his commandments. It is not enough to
   serve God, but we must serve him delightfully; for he is a good master,
   and his work hath wages in the mouth of it. It is a sign you are
   acquainted with the word of God, when the obedience which it requireth
   is not a burden but a delight to you. Alas! with many it is otherwise.
   How tedious do their hours run in God's service I no time seemeth long
   but that which is spent in divine worship. Do you count the clock at a
   feast? and are you so provident of time when about your sports? Are you
   afraid that the lean kine will devour the fat, when you are about your
   worldly business? What causeth your rejoicing? the increase of wealth,
   or grace?

   2. Is this the supreme delight of the soul? It is seen not so much by
   the sensible expression, as by the serious constitution of the soul,
   and the solid effects of it.

   [1.] Doth it draw you off from worldly vanities to the study of the
   word? What are your conceptions of it? What do you count your riches?
   To grow in grace, or to thrive in the world? To grow rich towards God,
   or to heap up treasures to yourselves? Is it your greatest care to
   maintain a carnal happiness?

   [2.] Doth it support you in troubles and worldly losses? and bear you
   out in temporal adversities? You cannot be merry unless you have riches
   and wealth and worldly accommodations; then, soul, eat, drink, and be
   merry!

   [3.] Doth it sweeten duties? The way of God's commandments is your way
   home. A beast will go home cheerfully. You are going home to rest. Let
   the joy of the Lord be your strength. Certainly you will think no
   labour too great to get thither, whither the word directs you. As one
   life exceedeth another, so there is more sensibleness in it. A beast is
   more sensible of wrong and hurt and of pleasure than a plant; and as
   the life of a man exceedeth the life of a beast, so is he more capable
   of joy and grief; and as the life of grace exceedeth the life of a mere
   man, so its joys are greater, its griefs greater. There are no
   hardships to which we are exposed for religion, but the reward
   attending it will make us to overcome.

SERMON XVI.

   I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways.--Ver.
   15.

   ALL along David had showed what he had done; now, what he will do. Ver.
   10, I have sought;' ver. 11, I have hid;' ver. 13, I have declared;'
   ver. 14, I have rejoiced.' Now, in the two following verses, he doth
   engage himself to set his mark towards God for time to come: I will
   meditate in thy precepts,' &c. We should not rest upon anything already
   done and past, but continue the same diligence unto the end. Here is
   David's hearty resolution and purpose to go on for time to come. Many
   will say, Thus I have done when I was young, or had more leisure and
   rest; in that I have meditated and conferred. You must continue still
   in a holy course. To begin to build and leave unfinished is an argument
   of folly. There is always the same reason for going on that there was
   for beginning, both for necessity, profit, and sweetness. We have no
   license to slack and give over till all be finished: Phil. ii. 12, Work
   out your own salvation; otherwise all you do is in vain, yet not in
   vain: Gal. iii. 4, in vain as to final reward, yet not in vain as to
   increase of punishment. You lose your cost, your watchings, striving,
   prayings; but you will gain a more heavy punishment, so that it had
   been better you had never be gun: 2 Peter ii. 20, 21, For if, after
   they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of
   our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein and
   overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning; for it
   had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness,
   than after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment
   delivered to them.' You bring an ill report upon God; your sense of the
   worth of heavenly things must needs be greater for your making trial;
   and therefore your punishment for neglect the greater. Into the
   vineyard they came at several hours, but all tarried till the close of
   the day. Some called sooner, some later, but all held out till the end:
   Heb. vi. 10, 11, you have ministered and must minister; you have prayed
   and must pray; you have heard the word with gladness, and must hear
   still. Many in youth are zealous, but when their first heats are spent,
   grow worldly, careless, and ready to sound a retreat from God. The fire
   of the altar was never to go out; so should the life, and warmth, and
   vigour of our affections to the word of God be ever preserved. God is
   the same still, and so is the word; and therefore we should ever be the
   same in our respects to it. The devil in policy lets men alone for a
   while, to manifest some respect to the ways of God, that they may after
   do religion a mischief. They are full of zeal, strict, holy, diligent
   in attendance upon ordinances. He never troubleth them, but is at truce
   with them all this while, till they get some name for the profession of
   godliness, and then he knoweth their fall will be the more scandalous
   and ignominious, not only to themselves, but to their profession. They
   are forward and hot men a while, till they have run themselves out of
   breath, and then by a notable defection shame themselves, and harden
   others.

   Compare it with the 13th verse, I have declared;' now I will meditate.'
   To be warm and affectionate in our expressions of respect to the word
   before others, and to slight it in our own hearts, argueth gross
   hypocrisy; therefore David would not only confer, but meditate. Many
   talk with others, but not with their own soul: Commune with your
   hearts, and be still.' True zeal is uniform; when there is no witness
   but God, it acts alike.

   Refer it to the 14th verse, David had spoken of his delight in the law;
   now, that he would meditate therein; in both not to boast, but to
   excite others by his example: that is to be understood all along when
   he speaketh of his diligence in and about the law of God. But mark,
   first the word was his delight, and then his meditation, Delight
   causeth meditation, and meditation increaseth delight: Ps. i. 2, But
   his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law doth he meditate
   day and night.' A man that delighteth in the law of God will exercise
   his mind therein. Our thoughts follow our affections. It is tedious and
   irksome to the flesh to meditate, but delight will carry us out. The
   smallest actions, when we have no delight in them, seem tedious and
   burdensome. It was no great matter for Haman to lead Mordecai's horse,
   yet a burdensome offensive service, because it was against his will.
   The difficulty that we find in holy duties lieth not in the duties
   themselves, but in the awkwardness of our affections. Many think they
   have no parts, and therefore they cannot meditate. He that findeth a
   heart to this work will find a head. Delight will set the mind a-work,
   for we are apt to muse and pause upon that which is pleasing to us. Why
   are not holy thoughts as natural and as kindly to us as carnal? The
   defect is in the heart: I have rejoiced in thy testimonies,' saith
   David, and therefore I will meditate in thy statutes.'

   In the words there is a double expression of David's love to the law of
   God:--

   1. I will meditate in thy precepts.

   2. I will have respect to thy ways.

   Concerning which observe--

   1. In both the notion by which the word of God is expressed and
   diversified, precepts, ways. The word precepts implieth God's
   authority, by which the counsels of the word are ratified. Ways
   implieth a certain direction for our walk to heaven. There are God's
   ways to us declared in his promises. So it is said, Ps. xxv. 10, All
   the paths of God are mercy and truth.' Our ways to God, ver. 4 of that
   psalm: Show me thy ways, teach me thy paths.' These are his precepts.

   2. Observe, the one is the fruit of the other: I will meditate;' and
   then, I will have respect.' Meditation is in order to practice; and if
   it be right, it will beget a respect to the ways of God. We do not
   meditate that we may rest in contemplation, but in order to obedience:
   Josh. i. 8, Thou shalt meditate in the book of the law day and night,
   that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written
   therein.' So Phil. iv. 8, 9, Think of these things,' do these
   things'--logizesthe. When you cast up your accounts, and consider what
   God hath required of you, it is that you may set upon the work.
   Meditation is not a flourishing of the wit, that we may please the
   fancy by playing with divine truths (sense is diseased that must be fed
   with quails), but a serious inculcation of them upon the heart, that we
   may urge it to practice. Nor yet an acquainting ourselves with the word
   that we may speak of it in company: conference is for others,
   meditation for ourselves when we are alone. Words are but the female
   issue of our thoughts, works the male. Nor merely to store ourselves
   with curious notions and subtile inquiries; study searcheth out a
   truth, but meditation improveth it for practical use: it is better to
   be sincere than subtile.

   3. Observe, this practical obedience is expressed by having respect
   unto the ways of God. To respect God's ways is to take heed that we do
   not turn out of them, to regard them and ourselves: Observe to do
   them,' Josh. i. 8; and it is called elsewhere, pondering our path:
   Prov. iv. 26, Ponder the path of thy feet,' that we may not mistake our
   way, nor wander out of it. Respect to God's word was opened ver. 6 and
   9. The main point is this--

   That one great duty of the saints is meditating on the word of God, and
   such matters as are contained therein.

   Let us inquire what meditation is, because the practice and know ledge
   of the duty is almost become a stranger to us. Before I can define, I
   must distinguish it. Meditation is--

   1. Occasional.

   2. Set and solemn.

   1. Occasional meditation is an act by which the soul spiritualiseth
   every object about which it is conversant. A gracious heart is like an
   alembic; it can distil useful thoughts out of all things that it
   meeteth with. Look, as it seeth all things in God, so it seeth God in
   all things. Thus Christ at Jacob's well discourseth of the well of
   life, John iv.; at the miracle of the loaves, discourseth of manna,
   John vi. and vii.; at the feast of tabernacles, of living waters; at
   the Pharisee's supper, discourseth of eating bread in the kingdom of
   God, Luke xiv. 15. There is a holy chemistry and art that a Christian
   hath to turn water into wine, brass into gold, to make earthly
   occasions and objects minister spiritual and heavenly thoughts. God
   trained up the old church by types and ceremonies, that the things they
   ordinarily conversed with might put them in mind of God and Christ,
   their duties, and dangers, and sins. And our Lord in the New Testament
   taught by parables and similitudes taken from ordinary functions and
   offices amongst men, that in every trade and calling we might be
   employed in our worldly business with a heavenly mind; that whether in
   the shop, or at the loom, or in the field, we might still think of
   Christ, and grace, and heaven. There is a parable of the merchantman, a
   parable of the sower, a parable of the man calling his servants to
   account, &c., that upon all these occasions we might wind up our minds,
   and extract some spiritual use from our common affairs. Thus the
   creatures lift up our minds to the creator. David had his night
   meditation: Ps. viii. 3, When I consider the heavens, the work of thy
   hands, the moon, and the stars which thou hast ordained,' &c.;--the sun
   is not mentioned. When he was gone abroad in the night, his heart was
   set on work presently: and Ps. xix. 5, there is a morning meditation,
   for he seemeth to describe the sun coming out of his chambers in the
   east, and displaying his beams like a cloth of gold upon the world. A
   holy heart cannot want an object to lead him to the meditation of God's
   power, and goodness, and glory, and wise providence, who hath made and
   doth order all things according to the counsel of his will. There is a
   great deal of practical divinity in the very bosom of nature, if we had
   the skill to find it out. Job biddeth us, Ask the beasts, and they
   shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee;
   or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee; and the fishes of the
   sea shall declare unto thee.' They speak by our thoughts.

   2. There is set and solemn meditation. Now this is of several sorts, or
   rather, they are several parts of the same exercise.

   [1.] There is a reflective meditation, which is nothing but a solemn
   parley between a man and his own heart: Ps. iv. 4, Commune with your
   own heart and be still;' when we have withdrawn ourselves from company,
   that the mind may return upon itself, to consider what we are, what we
   have been, what straits and temptations we have passed through, how we
   overcame them, how we passed from death to life. This is a necessary
   part of meditation, but very difficult. What can be more against
   self-love and carnal ease than for a man to be his own accuser and
   judge? All our shifts are to avoid our own company, and to run away
   from ourselves. The basilisk dieth by seeing himself in a mirror, and a
   guilty man cannot endure to see his own natural face in the glass of
   the word. The worldly man choketh his soul with business, lest, for
   want of work, the mind, like a mill, should fall upon itself. The
   voluptuous person melteth away his days in pleasure, and charmeth his
   soul into a deep sleep with the potion of outward delights, lest it
   should awake and talk with him. Well, then, it is necessary that you
   should take some time to discourse with yourselves, to ask of your
   souls what you have been, what you are, what you have done, what shall
   become of you to all eternity: Jer. viii. 6, No man asketh of himself,
   what have I done?' You would think it strange of two men that conversed
   every day for forty or fifty years, and yet all this while they did not
   know one another. Now, this is the case between us and our own souls;
   we live a long time in the world, and yet are strangers to ourselves.

   [2.] There is a meditation which is more direct, when we exercise our
   minds in the word of God and the matters contained therein. This is
   twofold:--

   (1.) Dogmatical, or the searching out of a truth in order to know
   ledge: Proving what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of
   God.' Rom. xii. 2. This is study, and differeth from meditation in the
   object, and supposeth the matter we search after to be unknown, either
   in whole or in part; whereas practical meditation is the inculcation or
   whetting of a known truth upon the soul: and it differs in the end; the
   end of study is information, and the end of meditation is practice, or
   a work upon the affections. Study is like a winter sun, that shineth,
   but warmeth not; but meditation is like blowing up the fire, where we
   do not mind the blaze but the heat. The end of study is to hoard up
   truth; but of meditation, to lay it forth in conference or holy
   conversation. In study, we are rather like vintners, that take in wine
   to store themselves for sale; in meditation, like those that buy wine
   for their own use and comfort. A vintner's cellar may be better stored
   than a nobleman's; the student may have more of notion and knowledge,
   but the practical Christian hath more of taste and refreshment.

   (2.) Practical and applicative. This we now speak of; and it is that
   duty and exercise of religion whereby the mind is applied to the
   serious and solemn consideration and improvement of the truths which we
   understand and believe, for practical uses and purposes. Not like a man
   that soweth and never reapeth; or a woman that often conceives, but
   never brings forth living children.

   (1st.) It is a duty; for it is commanded, Josh. i. 8, This book of the
   law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein
   day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is
   written therein.' As the promise is general, I will not leave thee nor
   forsake thee,' Heb. xiii. 5, so is the command. To meditate in the law
   is a part of the description of a godly man: Ps. i. 2, His delight is
   in the law of the Lord, and in that law doth he meditate day and
   night.' It is commended to us by the practice and example of the saints
   in scripture. Isaac, Gen. xxiv. 63, went out to meditate in the field
   in the eventide,' to pray, as in the margin; the word in the original
   is indifferent to both senses; it properly signifieth muttering, or an
   imperfect or suppressed sound. The Septuagint sometimes renders it by
   aei'dein, to sing; but others by adolesche?sai , which signifies to
   exercise himself. The word is used here en tais entolais sou
   adolesche'so. Symmachus, lalesai, to speak; Aquila, omilesai, to
   discourse with God and his own soul. The original word, lsvch,
   signifieth to mutter, or such a speaking as is between thoughts and
   words. He made his duty his refreshment and solace at night. So David
   often in this psalm. Reason enforceth it. God, that is a spirit,
   deserveth the most pure and spiritual worship by the mind, as well as
   that which is performed by the body. Thoughts are the eldest and
   noblest offspring of the soul, and it is fit they should be consecrated
   to converse with God.

   (2d.) It is a necessary duly; not a thing of arbitrary concernment, a
   moral help that may be observed and omitted at our pleasure; but of
   absolute use, without which all graces wither. Faith is lean unless it
   be fed with meditation on the promises: Ps. cxix. 92, I had fainted in
   my affliction, unless thy word had been my delight.' Hope is not lively
   unless we contemplate the thing hoped for, and, with Abraham, walk
   through the land of promise, Gen. xv., and think often and seriously on
   the glory of the riches of the inheritance of the saints,' Eph. i. 18,
   and get upon the mount of meditation, upon the top of Pisgah, to get a
   view of the land. So for love; the more we study the height, and
   breadth, and depth of God's love in Christ,' Eph. iii. 18, 19, the more
   is the heart melted and drawn out to God, and more quickened to
   obedience: Ps. xxvi. 3, Thy loving-kindness is before mine eyes.' And
   as it helpeth our graces in their exercise, so all other duties; as
   hearing of the word. To hear and not to meditate is unfruitful. The
   heart is hard and the memory slippery, the thoughts loose and vain; and
   therefore, unless we cover the good seed, the fowls of the air will
   catch it away. It is like a thing put into a bag with holes--lost while
   it is received: James i. 23, 24, Be ye doers of the word, and not
   hearers only, deceiving your own souls; for if a man be a hearer of the
   word, and not a doer, he is like a man beholding his natural face in a
   glass; for he beholdeth himself, and goeth away, and straightway
   forgetteth what manner of person he was.' Bare hearing begets but
   transient thoughts, and leaveth but a weak impression in the soul; like
   a flash of lightning, as soon gone as come, or the glance of a sunbeam
   upon a wave. A man never discerneth the scope, the beauty, the order of
   the truths delivered, till he cometh to meditate on them, and to go
   over them again and again in his thoughts: Ps. lxii. 11, God hath
   spoken once, twice have I heard this,' &c., i.e., when we repeat it
   upon our thoughts, inculcate it, and meditate upon it, this maketh a
   deeper impression, and that which is spoken rebounds again and again;
   it is twice heard. David saith, Ps. cxix. 99, I have more understanding
   than all my teachers, for thy testimonies are my meditation.' The
   preacher can but lay down general theorems and deduce practical
   inferences; but that which fasteneth them upon the heart is our own
   thoughts; and so we come to be wiser, to see more clearly and
   practically as to our own case than he that preacheth; we see a further
   use than he was aware of. So for prayer; what we take in by the word we
   digest by meditation, and let out by prayer. These three duties help
   one another. What is the reason men have such a barren, dry, and
   sapless spirit in their prayers? It is for want of exercising
   themselves in holy thoughts: Ps. xlv. 1, My heart inditeth a good
   matter;' and then My tongue is as the pen of a ready writer.' It
   alludeth to the mincah, the meat offering; the oil and flour were to be
   kneaded together, and fried in a pan, and so offered to the Lord. When
   we come with raw dough-baked offerings, before we have concocted and
   prepared our thoughts by mature deliberation, we are barren or
   tumultuary in our prayers to God. Prayer is called by the name of
   meditation, because it is the product and issue of it; as Ps. v. 1,
   Give ear to my words, O Lord; consider my meditation.' So Ps. xix. 14,
   Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be
   acceptable in thy sight;' implying that prayer is but the vent and
   expression of what we have deliberated and meditated upon. So David
   findeth his desires more earnest after grace, the more he mused and
   meditated: Ps. cxliii. 5, 6, I remember the days of old; I meditate on
   all thy works; I muse on the works of thy hands; I stretch forth my
   hands unto thee; my soul thirsteth after thee as a thirsty land.' Well,
   then, it is the life and strength of other ordinances, without which
   how slight and perfunctory are we! I might instance in conference; the
   stream of good discourse is fed by serious thoughts. The Lord's Supper,
   a duty which is mainly despatched by our thoughts; there we come to put
   reason to the highest use, to be the instrument of faith and love; of
   faith in believing applications; of love, in resolutions of duty and
   thankfulness. In that one ordinance there is a union of mysteries,
   which we take abroad in holy and serious thoughts. To have an
   unfruitful understanding, then, is a great damp and deadness to the
   heart. Now, we shall never en large ourselves in pertinent and savoury
   thoughts, unless we use to meditate; for spiritual dispositions do not
   come upon us of a sudden, and by rapt motions, but by progressive and
   orderly degrees and preparations.

   (3d.) It' is a profitable duty as to temporals. Isaac went out to
   meditate, and of a sudden he espieth the camels coming upon which
   Rebecca was brought to him, Gen. xxiv. 63, 64. Was this a mere
   accident, think you, or a providence worthy of remark and observation?
   Isaac goes to meet with God, and there he gets the first view of his
   bosom-friend and spouse. This was a mercy cast into the bargain.
   Godliness hath the promises of this life, and that which is to come.'
   There is nothing lost by duty and acts of piety. Seneca said the Jews
   were a foolish people, because they lost the full seventh part of their
   lives--Septimam aetatis partem perdunt vacando; in tending their
   sabbath-time. This is the sense of nature, to think all lost that is
   bestowed upon God. Flesh and blood crieth out, What need this waste?
   they cannot spare time from their callings, they have families to
   maintain. Oh! let me tell you, by serving God you drive on two cares at
   once. Worldly interests are cast into the way of religion, and though
   not designed and intended by us, these things are added to us. For
   comforts and manifestations of God, we have them many times in our
   recess and the privacy of our retirements, in a more plentiful manner
   than elsewhere. The spouse inviteth the bridegroom, Cant. vii. 11,
   Come, my beloved, let us go forth in to the field.' Upon which Bernard,
   O sancta anima, fuge publicum, fuge. An nescis te verecundum habere
   sponsum, qui nequaquam tibi velit indulgere praesentiam suam coram
   aliis? We have most experiences of God when we are alone with him, and
   sequestered from all distractions of company and business, solacing
   ourselves with God. Exod. iii. 1, Moses drove the sheep to the back
   side of the wilderness, and came to the mount of God: he goeth aside
   from the other shepherds, that he might converse with the great
   Shepherd and Bishop of our souls, and there he seeth the vision of the
   fiery bush. Usually God cometh to us in our deep meditation; when the
   soul is most elevated, and fittest to entertain the comforts of his
   presence, then we have sensible experience of God.

   The standing spiritual benefits of meditation are many. It imprints and
   fastens a truth upon the mind and memory. Deliberate thoughts stick
   with us, as a lesson we have conned is not easily for gotten. Civet
   long kept in a box, the scent remaineth when the civet is taken out.
   Sermons meditated on are remembered by us long after they are
   delivered: it sets the heart a-work. The greatest matters will not work
   upon him that doth not think of them. Tell them of sin, and God, and
   Christ, and heaven and hell, and they stir them not, because they do
   not take these truths into their deep thoughts; or if they be stirred a
   little, it is but a fit, while the truth is held in the view of
   conscience. We had need inculcate things if we would have them to
   affect us. The steel must beat again and again upon the flint, if we
   would have the sparks fly out; so must the understanding bear hard upon
   the will, to get out any affection and respect to the ways of God. It
   showeth the beauty of truths. When we look upon them in transitu, we do
   not see half that is in them; but upon a deliberate view it more
   appeareth; as there is a secret grace in some, that is not discerned
   but by much converse and narrow inspection. It helpeth to prevent vain
   thoughts. The mind of man is restless, and cannot lie idle; therefore
   it is good to employ it with good thoughts, and set it a-work on holy
   things; for then there will be no time and heart for vanity, the mind
   being prepossessed and seasoned already; but when the heart is left to
   run loose, vanity increaseth upon us. O Christians! meditation is all;
   it is the mother and nurse of knowledge and godliness, the great
   instrument in all the offices of grace. We resemble the purity and
   simplicity of God most in the holiness of our thoughts. Without
   meditation we do but talk one after another like parrots, and take up
   things by mere hearsay, and repeat them by rote, without affection and
   life, or discerning the worth and excellency of what we speak. It is
   meditation that maketh truths always ready and present with us: Prov.
   vi. 21, 22, Bind them continually upon thy heart; when thou goest, it
   shall lead thee; when thou wakest, it shall talk with thee.' But I
   forbear.

   1. Whereby the mind is applied to serious and solemn consideration. I
   add this, to distinguish it from occasional meditation, and those good
   thoughts that accidentally rush into our minds, and to note the care
   and attention of soul that we should use in such an exercise. It is
   musing makes the fire burn: glances or transient thoughts, or running
   over a truth in haste, is not meditation, but a serious attention of
   mind. It is not to take a snatch and away, but to make a meal of truth,
   and to work it into our hearts. Alas! a slight thought, that is like a
   flash of lightning, gone as soon as come, doth nothing. Constant
   thoughts are operative; and a truth, the longer it is held in the view
   of conscience, the more powerful it is: Deut. xxxii. 46, Set your
   hearts to all the words which I testify among you this day.' A sudden
   thought may be none of ours; it may be unwelcome, and find no
   entertainment with us, but set your hearts to it: Luke ix. 44, Let
   these things sink down into your hearts;' let them go to the quick:
   Prov. xviii. 1, Through desire a man having separated himself,
   intermeddleth in all wisdom.' Then is a man fit for these pure and holy
   thoughts, for intermeddling in all wise and divine matters, when he
   hath divorced himself from other cares, and is able to keep his
   understanding under a prudent confinement.

   2. Of the truths which we understand and believe. In meditation we
   suppose the object understood; for it is the work of study to search it
   out, of meditation to enforce and apply it; and we suppose it believed
   and granted to be a truth. The work now is to improve our assent, that
   it may have an answerable force and efficacy upon the soul.

   3. It follows in the description, for practical uses and purposes.
   Meditation is not to store the head with notions, but to better the
   heart. We meditate of God that we may love him and fear him; of sin,
   that we may abhor it; of hell, that we may avoid it; of heaven, that we
   may pursue it. Still the end is practical, to quicken us to greater
   diligence and care in the heavenly life.

   Use 1. To reprove those that are seldom in this work. Worldly cares and
   sloth and ease divert us; if we had a heart, we would have time and
   leisure. The clean beasts did chew the cud. We should go over, and
   over, and over again the truths of God in our thoughts. But alas!--

   1. Either men muse on trifles; all the day their minds are full of
   chaff and vanity. Oh! hast thou thoughts for other things, and hast
   thou no thoughts for God's precepts? Hast thou not a God and a Christ
   to think of? And is not salvation by him, and everlasting glory, worthy
   of your choicest thoughts? You have thoughts enough and to spare for
   other things--for base things, for very toys--and why not for God and
   the word of God? Why not for Christ and that everlasting redemption he
   hath accomplished for us? If a man would throw his meat and drink down
   the kennel, rather than give to him that asketh him, the world would
   cry shame upon him. Will you cast away your thoughts upon idle vanities
   rather than God shall have them? Oh, shame! Your thoughts must be
   working. What! shall they run waste, and yet God have no turn?

   2. Or else men muse on that which is evil. There are many sins engross
   the thoughts.

   [1.] Uncleanness sets up a stage in the heart, whereon a polluted fancy
   personates and acts over the pleasures of that sin. Our thoughts are
   often panders to our lust: 2 Peter ii. 14, Having eyes full of
   adultery, and that cannot cease from sin.' The unclean rolling of fancy
   on the beauty of women is forbid: Mat. v. 28, He that looketh on a
   woman to lust after her hath already committed adultery with her in his
   heart.'

   [2.] Revenge; the thoughts of it, how sweet are they to a carnal heart!
   Men dwell upon their discontents and injuries till, like liquors that
   sour in the vessel when long kept, they sharpen revenge. We are apt to
   concoct anger into malice: Frowardness is in his heart; he deviseth
   mischief continually; he soweth discord,' Prov. vi. 14.

   [3.] Envy stirreth up repining thoughts; it is a sin that feedeth on
   the mind: 1 Sam. xviii. 9, And Saul envied David from that day
   forward.' David's ten thousands ever ran in Saul's mind. Envy muses on
   the good of others to hate them.

   [4.] Pride, in lofty conceits and whispers of vanity: Luke i. 51, He
   hath scattered the proud in the imaginations of their hearts.' Proud
   men are full of musings. Is not this great Babylon that I have built,
   for the house of the kingdom, by the might of my power, and for the
   honour of my majesty?' Dan. iv. 30. Proud men please themselves with
   the suppositions of applause, and the echoes of praise in their minds.

   [5.] Covetousness consists chiefly in a vain musing: Ezek. xxxiii. 31,
   Their heart goeth after their covetousness;' 2 Peter ii. 14, Hearts
   exercised with covetous practices.'

   Use 2 is of exhortation, to press us to meditate on God's precepts.
   Many think it is an exercise that doth not suit with their temper; it
   is a good exercise, but for those that can use it. It is true there is
   a great deal of difference among Christians. Some are more serious and
   consistent, and have a greater command over their thoughts; others are
   of a more slight and weak spirit, and less apt for duties of retirement
   and recollection; but our unfitness is usually moral rather than
   natural, not so much by temper as by ill use. Now, sinful
   indispositions do not disannul our engagements to God, as a servant's
   drunkenness doth not excuse him from work. Inky water cannot wash the
   hands clean. That it is a culpable unfitness appeareth partly because
   disuse and neglect is the cause of it; those that use it have a greater
   command over the thoughts. Men count it a great yoke; custom would make
   it easy. Every duty is a help to itself; and the more we meditate the
   more we may. They that use it much find more of sweetness than
   difficulty in it. If a man did use to govern his thoughts, they would
   come more to hand. Partly, want of love. We pause and stay upon such
   objects as we delight in. Love naileth the soul to the object or thing
   beloved: Ps. cxix. 97, Oh, how I love thy law! it is my meditation all
   the day.' Carnal men find no burden in their thoughts; their heart is
   in them. Well, then, though you have not such choice and savoury
   thoughts as others have, yet set upon the work; you can think of
   anything you love.

   Oh! but, as some press it, it requireth art and skill, and logical
   disposition of places of argumentation.

   Ans. We cannot tie you to a method. Serious thoughts, no question, are
   required, and dealing with the heart about it in the best way of
   reasoning that we can use. Take these directions:--

   1. Look how others muse how to commit a sin; and shall not we muse how
   to redress it? Wicked men sit a-brood: Isa. lix. 5, They hatch the
   cockatrice egg, and weave the spider's web; they devise mischief upon
   the bed;' Micah ii. 1, Woe to them that devise mischief on their beds.'
   So do you muse how to carry on the work of the day with success: Prov.
   xvi. 30, The wicked man shutteth his eyes to devise froward things;' it
   signifies his pensive solitary muttering with himself.

   2. As you would persuade others to good. Surely you do not count
   admonition so hard a work. What words you would use to them, use the
   same thoughts to yourself: heart answereth to heart.

   3. You understand a truth; you have arguments evident and strong why
   you should believe it; repeat them over to the soul with application:
   Job v. 27, See it, and know it for thy good.' This application is
   partly by way of trial, partly by way of charge. By way of trial: How
   is it with thee, my soul? Rom. viii. 31, What shall we say to these
   things?' By way of charge and command: Ps. lxxiii. 28, It is good for
   me to draw nigh to God; I have put my trust in the Lord, that I might
   declare all thy works.'

SERMON XVII.

   I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy
   word.--Ver. 16.

   DAVID had spoken much of his respect to the word, both as to his former
   practice and future resolutions. A godly man, the more good he doth,
   the more he desireth, delighteth, and resolveth to do. Spiritual
   affections grow upon us by practice and much exercise. The graces of
   the Spirit and the duties of religion do every one fortify and
   strengthen one another; lose one, and lose all; keep one, and keep all.
   Meditation breedeth delight, and delight helpeth memory and practice.
   He had said, I will meditate on thy precepts;' and now, I will delight
   myself in thy statutes;' and that produceth a further benefit, I will
   not forget thy word.'

   The spiritual life is refreshed with change as well as the natural; but
   it is with change of exercise, not of affection. There is hearing,
   praying, conferring, meditating, and all with delight; for when one
   fontinel is drawn dry, we may, as the lamb doth, suck another that will
   yield new supply and sweetness. David had spoken of his various
   exercises about the word, in the use of all which he would maintain a
   spiritual delight.

   In this verse observe again a double respect to the word of God:--

   1. I will delight myself in thy statutes.

   2. I will not forget thy word.

   These are fitly suited. Delight preventeth forgetfulness; the mind will
   run upon that which the heart is delighted in; and the heart is where
   the treasure is, Mat. vi. 21. Worldly men, that are intent upon carnal
   interests, forget the word; it is not their delight. If anything
   displease us, we are glad if we can forget it; it is some release from
   an inconvenience to take off our thoughts from it; but it doubleth the
   contentment of a thing that we are delighted in to remember it and call
   it to mind. In the outward school, if a scholar by his own averseness
   from learning, or by the severity and imprudence of his master, by his
   morosity or unreasonable exactions, hath no delight in his book, all
   that he learneth is lost and forgotten; it goeth in at one ear, and out
   at the other: but this is the true art of memory, to cause them to
   delight in what they learn. Such instructions as we take in with a
   sweetness, they stick with us, and run in our minds night and day. So
   saith David here, I will delight in thy statutes: I will not forget thy
   word.'

   Doct. 1. One great respect which the saints owe to the word of God is
   to delight therein.

   David resolveth so to do: I will delight,' or solace or recreate my
   self in thy statutes; this should be his refreshment after business.
   David had many things to delight in;--the splendour and magnificence of
   his kingdom; as Nebuchadnezzar, Dan. iv. 30, Is not this great Babylon
   that I have built, for the house of the kingdom, by the might of my
   power, and for the honour of my majesty?' His great victories, which
   Aristotle saith are delightful to all. To` nikan edu`, ou mo'non tois
   philone'ikois alla` pasi; phantasi'a ga`r uperoches gu'gnetai. It is an
   appearance of excellency (Arist. Rhet. i. cap. 1 Or in his instruments
   of music; as those, Amos vi. 5, that chaunt to the sound of the viol,
   and invent to themselves instruments of music like David.' No; this was
   not the mirth that he chose for his portion. Wicked men throng their
   hearts with such delights as these, lest an evil conscience flee upon
   them;' but I will delight myself in thy statutes.' He might take
   comfort in a subordinate way in these things; but the solace of his
   life, and the true sauce of all his labours, was in the word of God. As
   David, so Jeremiah, chap. xv. 16, Thy words were found, and I did eat
   them; they were unto me as the joy and rejoicing of my heart.' That was
   the food and the repast of his soul, and he felt more warmth and
   cherishing in it than any can in their bodily food. So Paul: Rom. vii.
   22, I delight in the law of God in the inward man.' Not to know it
   only, but to feel the power of it prevailing over his lusts; that was
   his delight as to the better part of his soul. So it is made a general
   character of the blessed man: Ps. i. 2, that he delighteth in the law
   of God, and in that law doth he exercise himself day and night.' God's
   people will delight in his law; it is one of the greatest enjoyments
   they have on this side heaven, in the time of their absence from God.
   It is the instrument of all the good that they receive--comfort,
   strength, quickening. But now, how do they delight in God's statutes?

   1. In reading the word. The eunuch, returning from public worship, was
   reading a portion of scripture, Acts viii. 28. It is good to see with
   our eyes, and to drink of the fountain ourselves; if it seem dark
   without the explication of men, God, that sent Philip to the eunuch,
   will send you an interpreter.

   2. In hearing of the word. The command is, James i. 19. Wherefore be
   swift to hear.' The saints have had experiment of the power of it, and
   therefore delight in it. I was glad when they said, Come, let us go up
   unto the house of the Lord,' Ps. cxxii. 1. You should be glad of these
   occasions of hearing, not as, with the minstrel, to please the ear, but
   to warm the heart. Seeing is in heaven, hearing in the churches upon
   earth; then vision, now hearing.

   3. In conferring of it often. What a man delighteth in he will be
   talking of; so should you at home and abroad: Deut. vi. 7, Thou shalt
   be talking of them when thou sittest in thy house, and as thou walkest
   by the way,' seasoning thy journey. He that would have God to be in his
   journey, as travelling and walking abroad, should be speaking of divine
   things.

   4. In meditating and exercising his mind upon it: Ps. i. 2, He
   delighteth in the law of God, and in that law doth he meditate day and
   night.' Delight causeth a pause or consistency of mind: as the glutton
   rolleth the sweet morsel under his tongue, and is loath to let it go,
   so a godly man's thoughts will run along with his delight. Clean beasts
   chew the cud; God's children will be ruminating, going over the word
   again and again.

   5. In practice. This delight is not a bare speculation--so hypocrites
   have their tastes and their flashes--but in believing, practising,
   obeying: Ps. cxix. 14, I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies.'
   Delight breedeth obedience, and is increased and doubled by it. It is
   not the delight which an ordinary beholder taketh in a rare piece of
   painting, merely to admire the art; but the delight which an artist
   taketh in imitating it, and copying it out. Here in the text it is in
   thy statutes.' A gracious heart is alike affected with the rule as the
   promise; not only with discoveries of grace, but discoveries of duty.

   Now thus it must be ordinarily.

   1. The duties of every day must be carried on with delight. This must
   be our divertisement, and the refreshment of our other labours, that
   when tired out with the incumbrances of the world, we may look upon
   reading, meditating, hearing, as our recreation, and the salt and
   solace of our lives, that other things may go down the better. The
   labours of the mind do relieve those of the body, and those of the body
   those of the mind. Ainsworth saith, the word in the text signifieth, I
   will solace and recreate myself;' and Ps. i. 2, His delight is in the
   law of the Lord, and in that law doth he exercise himself day and
   night,' as was before cited.

   2. Especially upon the Lord's day: Isa. lviii. 13, Thou shalt call the
   sabbath a delight;' call it so, that is, account it so. When our whole
   time is to be parted into meditation, and prayer, and hearing, and
   conference, then it is our advantage to lie in the bosom of God all the
   day long. A bell is kept up with less difficulty when it is once
   raised; and when the heart is once got up, it is the better kept up in
   a holy delight in God.

   The reasons of it are two--

   1. The word of God deserveth it.

   2. This delight will be of great use to them. First, The word of God
   deserveth it.

   1. In regard to the author, they delight in it for the author's sake,
   be cause it is the signification of his mind; as a letter from a
   beloved friend is very welcome to us. Aristotle, mentioning the causes
   of delight, saith (Rhet. i. cap. 11), Hoi erontes, kai` dialego'menoi,
   kai` gra'phontes, kai` poiountes aei` ti` peri` tou erome'nou
   chai'raousin--lovers are mightily pleased when they hear anything of
   the party beloved, or receive any thing from them, a letter or a token.
   The word is God's epistle and love-letter to ourselves; it is the more
   welcome for his sake. The contrary God complaineth of: Hosea viii. 12,
   I have written to them the great things of my law, but they were
   counted as a strange thing.' God is the author, whosoever be the
   penman; it is a writing from him to us. Now, to be strangers to it, or
   little conversant about it, argueth some contempt of God; as to slight
   the letter of a friend showeth little esteem of the writer. But now the
   saints put it into their bosoms, view it with delight, it is God's
   epistle.

   2. In regard of its own excellency, in three respects; it is--

   [1.] Their direction.

   [2.] Their support.

   [3.] Their charter.

   [1.] It is their direction; it is a light that shines in a dark place,'
   2 Peter i. 19. The world is a dark place, beset with dangers, and ever
   and anon we are apt to stumble into the pit of destruction, without
   taking heed to this light. The word discovereth to them evils, that
   they may see them, repent of them, forsake them; and showeth us our
   ready way to heaven, that we may walk therein. It discovereth the
   greatest dangers, and pointeth out the surest way to safety and peace.
   They are called true laws and good statutes, Neh. ix. 13, to show the
   full proportion that they bear to the soul. Verum and bonum,--truth and
   goodness, are proper for our most eminent faculties, the understanding
   and will. It doth a man's heart good to study these statutes. A child
   of God, that seeth others stumble and fall, how may he stand and bless
   God for the direction of the word, that God hath given him counsel in
   his reins, that he hath a clue to lead him out of those labyrinths in
   which others have lost their way, and know not know to escape!

   [2.] It is their support. The word is koi`non iatreion, as Basil
   expresseth it. It is God's shop, from whence they fetch all their
   cordials in a time of fainting, and so are freed from those fears and
   discontents and despairing thoughts under which others languish: Ps.
   cxix. 50, This is my comfort in my affliction, thy word hath quickened
   me.' When a believer is damped with trouble, and even dead at heart, a
   promise will revive him again: ver. 92, Unless thy law had been my
   delight, I had perished in my affliction.' And many such like
   experiences the saints have had. The worth of the word is best known in
   an evil time. One promise in the word of God doth bear up the heart
   more than all the arguings and discourses of men, though never so
   excellent. In time of temptation, in the hour of death, oh, what a
   reviving is one word of God's mouth!

   [3.] It is their charter, that which they have to show for their
   everlasting hopes. There we have promises of eternal joy and
   blessedness under the greatest assurance, and this makes way for strong
   consolation, Heb. vi. 18. A man that hath a clear evidence to show for
   a fair inheritance, it is not irksome to hear it read, or to look over
   it now and then, as a covetous man is pleased to look into his bills
   and bonds which he has under hand and seal.

   Secondly, This delight will be of great use to them.

   1. To draw us off from carnal vanities. We have another delight, and
   the strength of the soul runneth out in another way; there will not be
   such room for worldly affections. As fear is cured with fear, the fear
   of men with the fear of God, so is delight by delight; delight in God's
   statutes is the cure of delight in worldly things. Love cannot lie
   idle, it must be occupied one way or another; either carried out to the
   contentments of the flesh, or else to holy things. Now, if you can find
   a more noble delight, there is a check upon that which is carnal: Ps.
   cxix. 37, Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity, and quicken thou
   me in thy way.' The enlargement of the heart straitens the flesh.

   2. It will take off the tediousness of religious exercises. What we
   delight in is not irksome. In hunting, fowling, and fishing, though
   there be as much labour as in our ordinary employments, yet we count
   the toil nothing because of the delight in them. We are very apt to be
   weary of well-doing, and to tire in a holy course; but now, when it is
   our delight, it goeth on the more easily. In one sense we must make
   religion our business, in another, our recreation; our work to prevent
   slackness, our recreation to prevent tediousness; it is not a task, but
   a pleasure.

   Use 1. This informeth us of the ill choice that many men make of their
   delights and recreations; they must have cards and dice and foolish
   mirth to pass away the time, or else idle stories and vain romances. A
   Christian is everywhere like himself; he showeth himself a Christian in
   his recreations as well as his business. Castae deliciae meae sunt
   scripturae tuae, saith Austin--Lord, my chaste delights are thy Holy
   Scriptures. If we were as we should be, it would be our recreation to
   understand our duty, to contemplate the way of reconciliation to God by
   Christ, and to take a view of our everlasting hopes. Were we seriously
   persuaded of the benefits which men have by the word, that there is a
   sure direction to resolve our doubts and our scruples, and the offers
   of a pardon and a glorious estate by Christ, what need a Christian any
   other recreation? Will not the sense of God's love and the hopes of
   heaven make us merry enough? Indeed, because of the weariness of the
   flesh, we need temporal refreshments; but here should be our great
   delight, I will solace or recreate myself in thy statutes.'

   Use 2. Caution to us to fix our delight aright.

   1. It is a considerable affection. All the affections depend upon
   pleasure or pain, delight or grief--the one is proper to the body, the
   other to the soul--which grow from the contentment or distaste which we
   receive from the divers objects which we meet with. If we love, it is
   for that we find a sweetness in the object beloved; if we hate, we
   apprehend a trouble in what we hate; if we hope, we promise ourselves a
   happiness or satisfaction in the possession of the thing hoped for: if
   we despair, it is because the thing cannot be obtained from which our
   contentment would arise. Desire is of some good which we judge
   pleasing. By fear and flight we shun things which we apprehend would
   breed us vexation. So that, in effect, delight sets all the other
   affections a-work.

   2. It is a choice affection, more proper to fruition than use, and
   therefore not for the means so much as end, and so reserved for God,
   who is the last end. There are fruenda and utenda, God and heavenly
   things to be enjoyed, but earthly things to be used: for means, those
   that are in the nearest vicinity to the end, as the law of God and
   grace: earthly things are to be used with a kind of indifferency, and
   therefore should have little of our joy; but our solid complacency must
   be in God, next in the things of God, his law and grace, which are
   means in the nearest vicinity with our end: Ps. xxxvii. 4, Delight
   thyself also in the Lord, and he shall give thee the desires of thy
   heart;' Phil. iv. 4, Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say,
   Rejoice.'

   3. Delight, if not right set, of all the affections, is apt to
   degenerate. We have a liberty to delight in earthly things; the
   affection is allowed, the excess is forbidden. Thou mayest delight in
   the wife of thy youth, in thy children, estate, in the provisions
   heaped upon thee by the indulgence of God's providence. Pleasure is the
   sauce of life, to better digest our sorrows. It is allowed us, but it
   must be well guarded. We are most apt to surfeit of pleasant things,
   and to miscarry by sweet affections. Sorrow is afflictive and painful,
   and will in time wear away of itself. Pleasure is ingrained in our
   natures, born and bred with us; and therefore, though we may delight in
   the moderate use of the refreshments of the present life, in estate,
   honour, reputation, yet we should take heed of excess, that our hearts
   be not overjoyed, and too much taken up about these things. Carnal joy
   is the drunkenness of the mind; it besotteth us, maketh us unmindful of
   God, weakens our esteem of his favour and blessing; it chaineth us to
   present things. Pleasure is the great witch and sorceress that enchants
   with the love of the world, maketh us unmindful of the country whence
   we came, and whither we are going; therefore we should be jealous of
   our delight, and how we bestow it.

   Use 3. To exhort us to this delight in God's statutes, or this
   spiritual rejoicing.

   1. Here is no danger of exceeding; the greatest excesses here are most
   praiseworthy. In other things we must exercise it with jealousy, feed
   with fear, rejoice as if we rejoiced not. A man may easily go beyond
   his bounds when he rejoiceth in the creature; but here enlarge thy
   heart as much as is possible, and take thy fill of pleasure: Cant. v.
   1, Eat, friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, beloved.' This is
   ebrietas quae nos castos facit--chaste flagons: Eph. v. 18, Be not
   drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be ye filled with the Spirit.'

   2. We shall never be ashamed of these joys: 2 Cor. i. 12, Our rejoicing
   is this, the testimony of our conscience,' &c. All carnal joys have a
   turpitude affixed to them, and therefore affect to lie hid under a veil
   of secrecy. The world would cry shame of him that would say of his bags
   or his dishes, Here is my joy. As much as men affect these things, yet
   they desire to conceal them from the knowledge of others.

   3. We shall never be weary of these joys. The delights of the senses
   become nauseous and troublesome; our natural dispositions become weary
   and importunate; a man must have shift and change, pleasures refreshed
   with other pleasures. But these delights add perfection to nature;
   therefore, when fully enjoyed, they delight most. A good conscience is
   a continual feast, a dish we are never weary of. The blessed spirits in
   heaven are never weary of beholding the face of God. God is new and
   fresh every moment to them. The contemplation of such excellent objects
   doth not overcharge and weaken the spirits, but doth raise and fortify
   them. It is true, the corporeal powers being weak, may be tired in such
   an employment, as much reading is a weariness to the flesh; but the
   object doth not grow distasteful, as in carnal things.

   How shall we get it?

   1. Get a suitableness to the word. Every man's delights are as his
   principles: Rom. viii. 5, They that are after the flesh, do mind the
   things of the flesh; but they that are after the spirit, the things of
   the spirit.' A man is much discovered by his savour and relish of
   things. All creatures must have suitable food. There must be a
   suitableness between the faculty and the object; spiritual things are
   spiritually discerned.

   2. Be in a condition to delight in the word. A guilty soul readeth its
   own doom there; it revealeth themselves to themselves, accuseth and
   condemneth them. As Ahab said of Micaiah, He prophesieth evil against
   me,' and therefore could not endure to hear him: John iii. 20, Every
   one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh he to the light,
   lest his deeds should be reproved.'

   3. Purge the heart from carnal distempers, lust, envy, covetousness r
   love of pleasures; these are diseases that need other diet than the
   word. Such persons must have other solaces; they cater for the flesh,
   to please the senses. An earthly heart will not delight in spiritual
   things.

   Doct. It standeth God's children upon to see that they do not forget
   the word.

   1. What is it to forget the word? A man may remember or forget two
   ways--notionally and affectively.

   [1.] Notionally, when the notions of things formerly known are either
   altogether or in part worn out: James i. 25, He is like one that looks
   at his natural face in a glass, but goeth away, and straightway
   forgetteth what manner of person he was.'

   [2.] Affectively, when, though, he still retain the notions, yet he is
   not answerably affected, nor doth act according thereunto. Thus the
   butler did not remember Joseph; that is, did not pity him. Thus God is
   said not to remember the sins of them that repent, when he doth not
   punish them, and to forget the afflictions of his people, when he doth
   not deliver them; and we are said to forget God, Ps. cvi. 21, when we
   do not obey him, and to forget his word when we do not remember his
   commandments to do them,' Ps. ciii. 18. In this place both are
   intended, the notional and practical remembrance.

   2. The reasons why we should not forget his word.

   [1.] Meditation will fail else. A barren, lean soul is unfit to enlarge
   itself in holy thoughts, shall never grow rich in the spiritual
   understanding: Col. iii. 16, Let the word of God dwell in you richly,
   in all knowledge,' &c. Men of small substance grow rich by continual
   saving, and holding together what they have gotten; but if they spend
   it as fast as they get it, they cannot be rich: Luke ii. 19, Mary kept
   all these sayings, and pondered them in her heart.'

   [2.] Delectation will grow cold, unless the memory be rubbed up ever
   and anon. When they fainted under affliction, the cause is intimated:
   Heb. xii. 5, Have ye forgotten the exhortation that speaketh unto you
   as unto children?' Distrust in straits is from the same source: Mark
   viii. 17, They remembered not the miracle of the loaves, for their
   hearts were hardened. Ye see and hear, and do not remember. David was
   under great discomfort till he remembered the years of the right hand
   of the Most High,' Ps. lxxvii. 10; Lam. iii. 21, This I recall to mind,
   therefore I have hope.'

   [3.] Practice and conscience of obedience will grow more remiss;
   Nothing keepeth the heart in a holy tenderness so much as a presence of
   the truth; and when we can bring our knowledge to act, and have it for
   our use upon all occasions, it urgeth us to practice: James i. 25,
   being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer.' Most of our sins are sins of
   forgetfulness and incogitancy. Peter would never have been so bold and
   daring, and done what he did, if he had remembered Christ's prediction.
   The text saith, Luke xxii. 61, When he remembered, he wept bitterly.' A
   bad memory is the occasion of much mischief to the soul, when we do not
   call truths to mind in their season, and when fit occasion and
   opportunity is offered. Memory is a handmaid to understanding and
   conscience, and keeps truths, and brings them forth when called for.

   Use is to press us to caution. Let us not forget the word. Helps to
   memory are:--

   1. Attention. Men remember what they heed and regard: Prov. iv. 21,
   Attend to my sayings; keep them in the midst of thy heart.' Where there
   is attention, there will be retention. Oh! lay up truths with much
   earnestness and care. Sensitive memory is seated in the hinder part of
   the head, as one would say in a chamber backward, from the noise of the
   street. Now, oh! lay up truth safe, and lay it out when ever you have
   need. But rational memory lieth near the understanding and conscience,
   in the midst of thine heart. Reverence in the admission of the word
   helps us in the keeping of it: Heb. ii. 1, Let us take hoed to the
   things which we have heard, lest at any time they slip front us.' If we
   did receive it with, more heed, we would retain it with more constancy;
   lay them up, keep them choicely.

   2. Affection, that is a great friend to memory. What we esteem most we
   best remember. Omnia quae curant senes meminerunt--an old man will not
   forget where he laid his bag of gold. Delight and love will renew and
   revive the object upon our thoughts. Here in the text we have this
   truth asserted, I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not
   forget thy word.' Affection to truths cometh from the application. In a
   public edict a man will be sure to carry away what is proper to his
   case.

   3. Meditation. We must be often viewing and meditating of what we have
   laid up in the memory. It availeth not to the health of the body to eat
   much, but to digest what is eaten. Tumultuary reading and hearing,
   without meditation, is like greedy swallowing much meat. When little is
   thought on, it doth not turn to profit. This concocteth and digesteth
   what we have heard. The more a thing is revolved in the mind, the
   deeper impression it maketh.

   4. Beware of inuring the mind to vain thoughts; for this distracts it,
   and hindereth the impression of things upon it. The face is not seen in
   running waters; nor can things be written in the memory, unless the
   mind be close and fixed. Lead is capable of engraving, because it is
   firm and solid; but quicksilver, because it is fluid, will not admit
   it. An inconsistent, wandering mind reapeth little fruit from what is
   read or heard.

   5. Order is a help to memory. Heads of doctrine are as cells wherein to
   bestow all things that are heard from the word. He that is well
   instructed in the principles of religion will most easily and firmly
   remember divine truths. Methodus est catena memoriae, to link truths
   one to another, that we may consider them in their proportion.

   6. Get a lively sense of what you hear or read, and you will remember
   it by a good token: Ps. cxix. 93, I will never forget thy precepts, for
   by them thou hast quickened me.' They that are quickened by a sermon
   will never forget such a sermon.

   7. Holy conference. The speaking often of good things keeps them in the
   heart; and the keeping of them there causeth us to speak to those that
   are about.

   8. Get the memory sanctified, as well as other faculties, and pray for
   the Spirit; for that faculty is corrupted as well as others.

SERMON XVIII.

   Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep thy
   word.--Ver. 17.

   IN the former part we heard of the virtue and excellency of the word,
   and therefore how much the saints desire to understand it, meditate of
   it, speak of it, and transfer it into their practice. Now, whosoever
   will resolve upon such a course, will necessarily be put upon prayer;
   for mark how David's purposes and prayers are intermingled, I will, and
   I will; and then presently prayeth again, Deal bountifully with thy
   servant, that I may live, and keep thy word.'

   In this request observe--

   1. It is generally expressed, together with his own relation to God,
   deal bountifully with thy servant.

   2. It is particularly explained wherein he would have this bounty
   expressed:--

   [1.] In the prorogation of his life, that I may live.

   [2.] In the continuance of his grace, and keep thy word; the one in
   order to the other. David doth not simply pray for life, but in order
   to such an end; and the general request concerneth both parts, yea,
   rather the latter than the former, that whilst I live I may keep thy
   word, as counting that to be the greatest benefit or argument of God's
   bounty, to have a heart framed to the obedience of his will.

   I might observe many things; as (1.) What a great honour it is to be
   God's servant. David, a great king, giveth himself this title, thy
   servant;' and Constantine counted it a greater honour to be a Christian
   than to be head of the empire. (2.) That all we have or expect cometh
   from God's bounty to us. So doth David express himself, Deal
   bountifully with thy servant;' as intimating not only the measure, but
   the rise and source of what he expected from God. (3.) That among all
   the benefits which we expect from the bounty of God, this is one of the
   greatest, to have an heart to keep his word.' (4.) God's word must not
   only be understood, but obeyed; for this is the meaning of keeping the
   word: John xiv. 21, He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them,'
   &c. Hath implieth knowledge. We must have them before we can keep them;
   but when we have them, we must keep them, and do what we know. But
   omitting all these points, which will be more fitly discussed
   elsewhere, I shall only point out two lessons:--

   1. The cause of life, and that is God's bounty.

   2. The end and scope of life; God's service.

   First, The cause of life, deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may
   live. Observe

   Doct. The prorogation of our lives is not the fruit of our merits, but
   the free grace of God.

   1. Long life is in itself a blessing, and so promised, though more in
   the Old Testament than in the New, when eternity was more sparingly
   revealed. That it is promised as a blessing is evident: Prov. xxviii.
   16, He that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days.' And in the
   fifth commandment: Exod. xx. 12, That thy days may be long in the land
   of the living.' So Ps. xci. 16, With long life will I satisfy him, and
   show him my salvation;' not only Leaven hereafter, but long life here.
   It is in itself a benefit, a mercy to the godly and the wicked. To the
   godly, that they may not be gathered till ripe; for God hath set a mark
   upon it: Prov. xvi. 31, The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be
   found in a way of righteousness.' It is some kind of resemblance of
   God, who is the Ancient of days. It was a title of honour, Paul the
   aged.' It giveth many advantages of glorifying God, and doing good to
   others. It is no small benefit to those that employ it well. To those
   that are in a state of sin, the continuance of life is a mercy, as it
   affords them time to repent and reconcile themselves to God. And the
   contrary is threatened as a curse: Eccles. viii. 13, He shall not
   prolong his days, because he feareth not God.' For wicked men to have
   the sun go down at noon-day, and to be cut off before their
   preparations or expectations, and so thrown headlong into hell by a
   speedy death, is a great misery.

   2. It is such a mercy as we have by God's gift. He is interested in it
   upon a double account.

   [1.] There is a constant providential influence and supportation, by
   which we are maintained in life, and without which all creatures vanish
   into nothing; as the beams of the sun are no longer continued in the
   air than the sun shineth, or as the impress is retained no longer upon
   the waters than the seal is kept on. When God suspendeth his
   providential influence and supportation, all doth vanish and disappear:
   Heb. i. 3, He upholdeth all things by the word of his power;' as a
   weighty thing is held up in the air by the hand that sustaineth it, or
   the vessels of the house hang upon a nail in a sure place.' God, that
   made all things by his word, upholdeth all things by the same word. A
   word made the world, and can undo the world. So Acts xvii. 28, In him
   we live and move and have our being.' We cannot draw breath without him
   for a moment; as the pipe hath no breath but what the musician puts
   into it. We can neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor drink, without this
   intimate support and influence from him. The scripture sets it out by a
   man's holding a thing in his hand: Job xii. 10, In whose hand is the
   soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.' Now, if God
   do but loosen his hand, his almighty grasp, all cometh to nothing: Job
   vi. 9. Let him loose his hand, and cut me off.' Life, and the comforts
   of life, depend upon God in every kind.

   [2.] There is a watchful eye and care of his providence over his
   people, whereby their life is preserved against all the dangers where
   with it is assaulted. God taketh care of all his creatures: Ps. xxxvi.
   6,. He preserveth man and beast;' but man much more: 1 Cor. ix. 9, Doth
   God take care of oxen?' He dealeth bountifully with his enemies, but
   much more doth he preserve the feet of his saints,' 1 Sam. ii. 9. The
   care of his providence hath its degrees; it is more intensively
   exercised about things of worth and value, and most of all about the
   life of his saints. When Satan had a commission to exercise Job, first
   his person was exempted: Job i. 12, Upon himself put not forth thy
   hand;' next his life: Job ii. 6, Behold he is in thy hand, but save his
   life.' A godly man hath an invisible guard and hedge round about him.
   We are not sensible of it; but Satan, who is our enemy, he is sensible
   of it: when he would make his assault, he cannot find a gap and breach,
   till God open it to him. Both these notions are sufficient to possess
   us how much God is interested in prolonging our lives.

   3. The next thing is, that we have it by the mere bounty and free grace
   of God. It is not from his strict remunerative justice, but his kind
   love and tender mercy. The air we breathe in, we have it not by merit,
   but by grace: Lam. iii. 22, It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not
   consumed, because his compassions fail not.' The reasons are two:--

   [1.] We deserve nothing at his hand.

   [2.] We deserve the contrary.

   (1.) We cannot merit of God: Job. xxii. 2, Can a man be profitable to
   God, as he that is wise is profitable to himself?' Job xxxv. 7, If thou
   be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he at thy hand?'
   Whatever God doth for creatures, he doth it freely, because he cannot
   be obliged or pre-engaged by us. In innocency Adam could impetrare, but
   not mereri--obtain it by covenant, not challenge by desert. Therefore
   God conferreth as freely as he createth.

   (2.) If God would deal with us upon terms of merit, we cannot give him
   a valuable compensation for temporal life--Gen. xxxii. 10, I am less
   than the least of all thy mercies.' None of God's mercies can simply be
   said to be little; whatever cometh from the great God should be great
   in our value and esteem; as a small remembrance from a great king. Yet
   in comparison between the blessings, one may be said to be least, the
   other greatest. Temporal life with its appendages, compared with
   spiritual and eternal, is in the rank of his least mercies. God giveth
   life to the plants, to the trees, to the beasts of the field; and yet,
   when we and our deservings come into the balance, we are found wanting:
   I am not worthy,' &c. All our righteousness doth not deserve the air we
   breathe in. It is so defective, if a man were to pay for his life, it
   could not merit the continuance of it.

   [2.] We have deserved the contrary; we have put ourselves out of God's
   protection by sin. Death waylaid us when we were in our mother's womb;
   and as soon as we were born, there was a sentence in force against us:
   Death came upon all, for that all have sinned.' Rom. v. 12; and still
   we continue the forfeiture, and every day provoke God to cut us off; so
   that it is a kind of pardoning mercy that continueth us every moment.
   Of this we are most sensible in case of danger and sickness, when there
   is but a step between us and death; for then the old bond beginneth to
   be put in suit, and God cometh to execute the sentence of the law; and
   deliverance in such a case is called forgiveness and remission, and
   that even to the wicked and impenitent. As Ps. lxxviii. 38, And he,
   being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them
   not.' It is called a remission improperly, because it was a reprieve
   for the time from the temporal judgment; it was not an executing the
   sentence, or a destroying the sinner presently; and that not from
   anything in the sinner, but from God's pity over him as his creature.
   But now a godly man hath a true pardon renewed at such time, and he is
   loved from the grave;' for so it is in the Hebrew: Isa. xxxviii. 17,
   Thou hast loved my soul from the pit of destruction.' To be loved out
   of a danger, and loved out of a sickness, oh! that is a blessed thing.

   Use 1. To acknowledge the Lord's goodness in these common mercies. We
   did not give life to ourselves, and we cannot keep it in ourselves. God
   made us, and God keepeth us. It was not our parents that fashioned us
   in the womb; they could not tell what the child would prove, male or
   female, beautiful or deformed. They could not tell the number or
   posture of the veins, or bones, or muscles; it was all the curious
   workmanship of a wise God; and it is the same God that hath kept us
   hitherto: Isa. xlvi. 3, 4, By me ye are borne from the belly, and
   carried from the womb; even to old age I am he, and even to hoar hairs
   will I carry you,' &c. We have been supported and tenderly handled by
   God, as parents and nurses carry their younglings in their arms. Many
   times wanton children are ready to scratch the faces of those that
   carry them; so have we put many affronts upon him, yet to the very last
   doth he carry us in the arms of his providence. In infancy we were not
   in a capacity to know the God of our mercies, and to look after him;
   but nevertheless he looked after us. Afterwards we knew how to grieve
   him and offend him, long before how to love and serve him. Oh, how
   early did our naughty hearts appear! and all along how little have we
   done for God, in whom we live and move and have our being!' He is not
   far from us,' in the effects of his care and providence; but we are far
   from him by the distance of our thoughts and affections, by the carnal
   bent of our hearts. It is a good morning exercise for us humbly and
   thankfully to consider of his continual mercies. For God's compassions
   are new every morning,' Lam. iii. 22--as fresh as if never tired with
   former acts of grace, nor wearied with former offences. It is some
   recompense for the time of sleep; half our time passeth away, and we do
   not show one act of love and kindness unto God; therefore, as soon as
   we are awakened we should be with God, Ps. cxxxix. 18. How many are
   gone down to the chambers of death since the last night!

   2. It quickeneth us to love and serve God, who is the strength of our
   lives, and the length of our days,' Deut. xxx. 20. Thy life is wholly
   in God's hands. Man cannot add a cubic to his stature, nor make one
   hair white or black at his own pleasure. It is the Lord's providential
   influence that keepeth thee alive; in point of gratitude, thou shouldst
   serve him: Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live.' But I
   may urge also, in point of hope, God's servants can best recommend
   themselves to his care and keeping by prayer, and expect to walk
   continually under divine protection. Those that provoke God
   continually, they may be continued by the bounty and indulgence of his
   providence; but yet they can look for no such thing, and in the issue
   it proveth to be in wrath, for their sins are more and judgments
   greater: it is but to treasure up wrath to the day of wrath.'

   3. If life temporal be the fruit of God's bounty, much more life
   eternal: Rom. vi. 23, The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is
   eternal life.' One is wages, the other a gift.

   4. It informeth us that we may lawfully pray for life, with submission
   to the will of God, and that death may not come upon us suddenly,
   contrary to the ordinary course of nature. I was loath to make a
   distinct doctrine of it, yet I could not decline the giving out of this
   truth.

   How will this stand with our desires of dissolution, and willingness to
   depart and to be with Christ, which certainly all Christians that
   believe eternity should cherish in their hearts?

   To this I answer--1. By concession; that we are to train up ourselves
   in an expectation of our dissolution, that we may be willing when the
   time is come, and God hath no more work for us to do in the world; we
   are to awaken our desires after the presence of Christ in heaven, to
   show both our faith in him and love to him. Since Christ was willing to
   come down to us, though it were to meet with shame and pain, why should
   we be loath to return to him? Jacob's spirit revived when he saw the
   waggons which Joseph sent to carry him. Death is the chariot to carry
   you to Christ, and therefore it should not be unwelcome to us.

   2. By correction; though it be lawful and expedient to desire death,
   yet we are not anxiously to long after it till the time come; there may
   be sin in desiring death, as when we grow weary of life out of
   desperation, and the tiresomeness of the cross; and there may be grace
   in desiring life, that we may keep his word, longer express our
   gratitude to him here in the world, to mourn for sin, to promote his
   glory. More fully to make this evident to you, I shall show how we may
   desire death, how not. To answer in several propositions:--

   [1.] There is a great deal of difference between serious desires and
   passionate expressions. The desires of the children of God are
   deliberate and resolved, conceived upon good grounds, after much
   struggling with flesh and blood to bring their hearts to it. Carnal men
   are loath that God should take them at their word; as he in the fable
   that called for death, and when he came, desired him to help him up
   with his burden. Alas! they do not consider what it is to be in the
   state of the dead, and to come unprovided and unfurnished into God's
   presence. We often wish ourselves in our graves; but if God should take
   us at our word, we would make many pauses and exceptions. Men that in
   their miseries call for death, when sickness cometh will run to the
   physician, and promise many things if they may be recovered. None more
   unwilling to die than those that in a passion wish for death.

   [2.] We must carefully look to the grounds of these wishes and desires.
   First, Carnal wishes for death arise either--(1.) Out of violent anger
   and a pet against providence; as Jonah iv. 8, The sun beat upon the
   head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said,
   It is better for me to die than live.' The children of Israel murmured
   when they felt the famine of the wilderness: Exod. xvi. 3, And the
   children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand
   of the Lord in the land of Egypt,' &c. When men are vexed with the
   world, they look upon death as a relief, to take vengeance upon God, to
   deprive him of a servant. (2.) In deep sorrow; as Job iii. 3; Elijah, 1
   Kings xix. 4: He requested for himself that he might die; and he said,
   It is enough: now, O Lord, take away my life, for I am not better than
   my fathers.' (3.) From the peevishness of fond and doting love: 2 Sam.
   xviii. 33, And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over
   the gate and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O Absalom, my son,
   would God I had died for thee! O Absalom, my son, my son!' like the
   wives of the East Indians, that burn themselves to follow their dead
   husbands. (4.) From distrust and despair, when the evil is too hard to
   be resisted or endured: Job vii. 15, My soul chooseth strangling and
   death rather than my life.' In all these cases it is but a shameful
   retreat from the conflict and burden of the present life, from carnal
   irksomeness under the calamity, or a distrust of God's help. There may
   be murder in a rash wish, if it proceed from a vexed heart. These are
   but froward thoughts, not a sanctified resolution. Secondly, Such
   desires of death and dissolution as are lawful, and must be cherished,
   come from a good ground, from a heart crucified and deadened to the
   world, and set on things above: Col. iii. 1, If ye then be risen with
   Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the
   right hand of God.' From a competent assurance of grace: Rom. viii. 23,
   Even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to
   wit, the redemption of our body.' From some blessed experience of
   heavenly comforts, having tasted the fruits, clusters of Canaan, they
   desire to be there. So Simeon: Luke ii. 29, Lord, now lettest thou thy
   servant depart in peace according to thy word, for mine eyes have seen
   thy salvation;' the eyes of his faith, as well as the eyes of his body.
   Now, Lord, I do but wait, as a merchantman richly laden desireth to be
   at his port. A great love to Christ excites desires to be with him:
   Phil. i. 23, I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart,
   and to be with Christ, which is far better;' Phil. iii. 19, 20, For our
   conversation is in heaven, from whence also we look for the Saviour,
   the Lord Jesus Christ.' They long to see and be where he is; heart and
   head should be together. Weariness of sin, and a great zeal for God's
   glory, are powerful incentives in the saints: Rom. vii. 23, O wretched
   man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?' They
   would be in heaven, that they may sin no more.

   [3.] You must look to the end; not have a blind notion of heaven, look
   for a Turkish paradise full of ease and plenty; a carnal heaven, as the
   Jews looked for a carnal Messiah; but for a state of perfect union and
   communion with the blessed and holy God.

   [4.] The manner must be regarded; it must be done with submission,
   Phil. i. 24; otherwise we encroach upon God's right, and would deprive
   him of a servant without his leave. A Christian will die and live as
   the Lord willeth; if it be the Lord's pleasure, a believer is satisfied
   with long life: Ps. xci. 16, With long life will I satisfy him, and
   show him my salvation;' he will wait till the change come,' when God
   shall give him a discharge by his own immediate hand, or by enemies.
   God knoweth how to choose the fittest time, otherwise we know not what
   we ask.

   Secondly, Now let me speak of the scope of our lives. David simply doth
   not desire life, but in order to service. The point is--

   That if we desire long life, we should desire it to glorify God by
   obedience to his word.

   Let me give you some instances, then reasons.

   1. Instances: Ps. cxviii. 17, I shall not die, but live, and declare
   the works of the Lord.' This was David's hope in the prolongation of
   life, that he should have farther opportunity to honour God; and this
   argument he urgeth to God when he prayeth for life: Ps. vi. 5, For in
   death there is no remembrance of thee; in the grave who shall give thee
   thanks?' It would be better for him to be with God; but then the life
   is worth the having, when the extolling of Christ is the main scope at
   which we aim. So Paul: Phil. i. 20, According to my earnest expectation
   and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all
   boldness, as always, so now also, Christ shall be magnified in my body,
   whether it be by life or by death,' &c. Paul was in some hesitation
   which he should choose, life or death; and he determineth of both as
   God might be magnified by either of them, and so was at a point of
   indifference. If God should give him his option or wish, he would give
   the case back again to God, to determine as it might be most for his
   service and glory. He was not swayed by any low and base motives of
   contentment in the world, or any low and creature enjoyments; these are
   contemptible things to come into the balance with everlasting glory. It
   was only his service in the gospel, and the public good of the church,
   that made the case doubtful.

   Reas. 1. This is the perfection of our lives, and that which maketh it
   to be life indeed. Communion with God is the vitality of it, without
   which we are rather dead than alive. Life natural we have in common
   with the beasts and plants; but in keeping the word, we live the life
   of God: Eph. iv. 18, Having the understanding darkened, being alienated
   from the life of God.' To natural men it is a gloomy thing; but to
   believers this is the life of life, and that which is the joy of their
   hearts. To increase in stature, and to grow bulky, that is the life of
   plants; the greatest and biggest of the kind are most perfect. To live
   and enjoy pleasures without remorse, that is the perfection and life of
   beasts, that have no conscience, that shall not be called to an
   account. To gratify present interests, and to be able to turn and wind
   worldly affairs, that is the life of carnal men, that have no sense of
   eternity. But the perfection of the life of man as a reasonable
   creature is to measure our actions by God's word, and to refer them to
   his glory.

   Reas. 2. It is the end of our lives that God may be served: All things
   are by him, and through him, and to him.' Rom. xi. 36; angels, men,
   beasts, inanimate creatures. He expects more from men than from beasts,
   and from saints than from men; and therefore life by them is not to be
   desired and loved but for this end: Rom. xiv. 6-8, He that regardeth a
   day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to
   the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for
   he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord eateth not,
   and giveth God thanks: for none of us liveth to himself, and no man
   dieth to himself; for whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and
   whether we die, we die unto the Lord. Whether we live, therefore, or
   die, we are the Lord's.'

   Use 1. For reproof. Every man desireth life. The whole world would all
   and every one of them put up this request to God, Deal bountifully with
   thy servant, that I may live;' but there is not one man in a hundred
   that considereth why he should live. Some would live to please the
   flesh, and to wallow in the delights of the present world; a brutish
   wish! An heathen could say, he doth not deserve the name of a man that
   would spend his time in pleasure one day. These would not leave their
   husks and their hog trough. This was not David's desire, but that he
   might keep the law, and faithfully worship God.

   Some, again, desire to see their children well bestowed, or to free
   their estate from incumbrance; this is distrust, as if we did not leave
   a God behind us, who hath promised to be a father of the fatherless,
   and to take care of our little ones. Can we venture ourselves in God's
   hands, and can we not venture our families with him, whose goodness
   extendeth to all his creatures? Some are loath to leave such as are
   dear to them, wife and children and friends; and is not God better, and
   Christ better? These must be loved in God and after God. We set friends
   in the place of God and Christ, when we can be content to be absent
   longer from God merely upon this ground, because we are loath to be
   separated from our friends. He that loveth father and mother, and
   husband and wife, more than me, is not worthy of me,' saith Christ. Oh,
   how far are these from any Christian affection! Surely to a believer it
   is a piece of self-denial to be kept out of heaven longer; therefore it
   must be sweetened by some valuable compensation; something there must
   be to calm the mind contentedly to spare the enjoyment of it for a
   while. Now, next to the good pleasure of God, which is the reason of
   reasons, there is some benefit which we pitch upon. Nothing is worthy
   to be compared but our service, if God may have glory, if our lives may
   do good. A gracious heart must be satisfied with gracious reasons. Some
   may desire life, because they are dismayed with the terrors of death;
   but this is unbelief. Hath not Christ delivered us not only from the
   hurt of death, but the fear of death? Heb. ii. 14, And deliver them who
   through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.'
   Where is your faith? Death is yours,' 1 Cor. iii. 22. It is a sin
   simply to desire life; but look to the causes and ends of it.

   Use 2. It directeth us how to dispose of our lives. For this end take a
   few considerations.

   [1.] This life is not to be valued but by opportunities of service to
   God. It is not who liveth most plentifully, but most serviceably to
   God's glory: Acts xiii. 36, David, after he had served his generation,
   by the will of God he fell asleep.' Every one was made to serve God in
   his generation, and hath his office and use as an instrument of divine
   providence, from the king to the peasant. We are undone if the
   creatures, made to serve us, should fail in their season. We were made
   to serve God in our season.

   [2.] This service is determined by the course of God's providence. He
   is the great master of the scenes, that appointeth us what part to act,
   and sets to every man his calling and state of life. John xvii. 4, our
   Saviour saith, I have finished the work thou hast given me to do.' We
   must not be our own carvers, prescribe to God at what rate we will be
   maintained, nor what kind of work we will perform. Those that are free
   may covenant with you, and make their bargain, what kind of service
   they will undertake; but we are at God's absolute dispose, to be used
   as vessels of honour or dishonour, as fitted and disposed.

   [3.] In the management of this work we must measure our actions by
   God's word, and refer them to his glory. By God's word: Ps. cxix. 105,
   Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my paths.' His glory:
   Col. iii. 17, And whatsoever ye do, in word or deed, do all in the name
   of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.'

   [4.] Death shall not prevent us, till we have ended our appointed
   service. As long as God hath work for us to do, he will maintain life
   and strength: Gal. i. 15, Who separated me from my mother's womb, and
   called me by his grace.' The decree taketh date from the womb. God
   frames parts and temper; God rocketh us in our cradles, taketh care of
   us in our infancy, and all the turns of our lives.

   [5.] If God will use us to a great age, we must be content. You may
   adorn your profession, and bring forth fruit in old age. The longest
   life is too short to honour God: Ps. xcii. 13, Those that be planted in
   the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God.' We
   should count it our happiness to be still used, and that we are fully
   rewarded by being employed in further service.

   [6.] Life must be willingly laid down when we cannot keep it but with
   forsaking the word: Luke xiv. 26, If any man come unto me, and hate not
   his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren and
   sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.'

   [7.] The life of eternity must be subordinate to this great end, the
   glory of God; our desire of it must be, that we may be to the praise of
   God.

SERMON XIX.

   Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy
   law.--Ver. 18.

   THE heathens thought that man had not a power over his life, but a
   power over his actions--Quod vivamus, Deorum munus est; quod bene
   vivamus, nostrum. But the Psalmist acknowledgeth God in both: Deal
   bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep thy law;' that
   he could not live nor keep the word without God's grace. This latter he
   amplifieth in this verse, that he was so far from keeping it, that he
   could not so much as know it savingly and practically without divine
   grace: Lord, open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out
   of thy law.' Here is--

   1. A request, open thou mine eyes.'

   2. The reason, from the end, benefit, and fruit of it, that I may,' or
   then I shall, behold wondrous things out of thy law.'

   In which reason is intimated the necessity of divine illumination, and
   then the profit of it.

   1. The necessity, that I may behold, &c.--i.e., otherwise I cannot.

   2. The profit, then I shall behold wondrous things out of thy law.

   Doct. 1. That we need that God should open our eyes, if we would have a
   right understanding of his word.

   1. What is meant by opening the eyes.

   2. The necessity of such a work in order to a right understanding of
   the word of God.

   First, What is meant by opening the eyes. Before I come to the
   particular explication of the terms, let me premise two observations.

   1. The saints do not complain of the obscurity of the law, but of their
   own blindness. The Psalmist doth not say, Lord, make a plainer law,'
   but, Lord, open mine eyes.' Blind men might as well complain of God
   that he doth not make a sun whereby they might see. The word is A light
   that shineth in a dark place,' 2 Peter i. 19. There is no want of light
   in the scripture, but there is a veil of darkness upon our hearts; so
   that if in this clear light we cannot see, the defect is not in the
   word, but in ourselves.

   2. The light which they beg is not anything besides the word. When God
   is said to enlighten us, it is not that we should expect new
   revelations, but that we may see the wonders in his word, or get a
   clear sight of what is already revealed. Those that vent their own
   dreams under the name of the Spirit and divine light, they do not give
   you mysteria, but monstra, portentous opinions; not show you the
   wondrous things of God's law, but the prodigies of their own brain;
   unhappy abortives, that die as soon as they come to light: Isa. viii.
   20, To the law and to the testimony; if they speak not according to
   this word, it is because there is no light in them.' The light which we
   have is not without the word, but by the word.

   Now to the phrase. The Hebrew signifieth unveil mine eyes.' There is a
   double work--negative and positive: there is a taking away the veil,
   and an infusion of light. Paul's cure of his natural blindness is a fit
   emblem of our cure of spiritual blindness: Acts ix. 18, Immediately
   there fell from his eyes as it had been scales, and he received sight
   forthwith.' First the scales fall from our eyes, and then we receive
   sight.

   1. There is a taking away the veil before we can have a true discerning
   of the mysteries that are revealed in the word of God: 2 Cor. iii. 14,
   15, the apostle, speaking of the Jews, saith, But their minds were
   blinded; for until this day remaineth the same veil untaken away, in
   the reading of the Old Testament; which veil is done away in Christ:
   but even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their
   hearts.' Now this veil is diverse.

   [1.] The veil of ignorance. Though man hath reason, and is capable of
   understanding the sense and importance of the words that are used about
   the mysteries of godliness, yea, and the matter too, yet he gets not
   the saving knowledge of them by his natural abilities. There is a
   grammatical knowledge and a spiritual knowledge; a man may know things
   grammatically and literally that is ignorant of them spiritually; as a
   child may read the letters and words that doth not conceive of the
   sense. So a man may know what is said concerning God and Christ, and
   sin and grace, the vanity of the creature, the excellency of heaven,
   and have yet no saving knowledge of these things; and therefore the
   scripture useth the expression that they oversee in seeing; as Acts
   xxviii. 26, Hearing, ye shall hear, and not understand; seeing, ye
   shall see, and not perceive.' Though truths are never so plainly
   delivered, never so powerfully pressed, and though they are capable to
   understand the words, yet they do not take the truth into their hearts,
   so as to profit by it. So Deut. xxix. 2-4, Ye have seen,' yet ye have
   not an heart to see.' Most will declaim against the vanity of the
   creature and evil of sin; but they do not see with an affective
   heart-piercing light; they have on them the veil of spiritual
   ignorance.

   [2.] The veil of carnal knowledge and wisdom, that puffeth up, 1 Cor.
   viii. 1, 2, by which, seeing not, we think we see. This is a great
   hindrance to the entertaining of the word. So Christ telleth the
   Pharisees, who were conceited of their own knowledge, John ix. 39, For
   judgment am I come into this world, that they which see not might see,
   and they which see might be made blind.' The Pharisees were the rabbis
   of the age, the most seeing and learned men of that time. Carnal men
   are puffed up with a conceit of their own abilities, and so are
   obstructed by them from profiting by the gospel.

   [3.] The veil of prejudice and corrupt affections. The passions of the
   mind, love and fear, desire and anger, hinder us from judging aright in
   the things of God. Our hearts are overcast with strong affections to
   the world, and so cannot clearly judge either of practical truths or of
   the controversies of the age. Not of practical truths: When Christ had
   taught that they could not serve God and mammon,' it is said, Luke xvi.
   14, And the Pharisees, that were covetous, derided him.' Holy
   mortifying truths are unpleasing to a carnal ear, though they be
   represented with never so much evidence. How will men distinguish
   themselves out of their duty! They shift, and stretch, and turn and
   wind hither and thither, and prove truth to be no truth, rather than
   part with their lusts. So present truths, as the apostle calls them, 2
   Peter i. 12, when the dust of interest is raised, are not discerned.
   The orthodoxy of the world is usually an age too short: 2 Cor. iv. 4,
   The god of this world hath blinded their eyes.'

   [4.] The veil of carnal sense: 2 Peter i. 9, He that lacketh these
   things is blind, and cannot see afar off.' There are so many mists and
   clouds in the lower world, that men cannot outsee time, and without the
   prospective of faith have a sight of eternity. Nature is short sighted,
   so inured to present things that we receive no light concerning things
   to come. These are the scales that are upon our eyes.

   2. There is an infusion of light, without which men of excellent wit
   and sharp understanding in other things are stark blind in the things
   of God. What this light is will appear by the degrees of knowledge and
   the uses of this light.

   [1.] The degrees of knowledge.

   (1.) In some there is a simple nescience, both of terms or notions, and
   things, as in those that have not a revelation, or have not regarded it
   when the revelation is made. As the Gentiles, that have not a
   revelation: Eph. iv. 18, Having their understanding darkened, being
   alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them,
   because of the blindness of their heart.' Or rude and ignorant
   Christians, that have not the advantage of education, so as to
   understand the notions in which the doctrine of God is propounded: Isa.
   xxviii. 9, 10, Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to
   understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from
   the breasts: for precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept,
   line upon line, line upon line, here a little and there a little.' So
   sottish and brutish are some, that a man had need teach them as he
   teacheth little children, letter after letter, and line after line,
   little good done.

   (2.) In others there is a grammatical knowledge but not a spiritual, a
   repeating things by rote, a talking of all that a Christian enjoyeth.

   (3.) Besides the grammatical knowledge, there is a dogmatical
   knowledge, when the truths of the word are not only understood, but
   begin to settle into an opinion that we bustle for in the world. An
   opinionative receiving of the truth is different from a saving
   receiving of the truth. Many are orthodox, or have so much judgment and
   knowledge as to hold the truth strictly, but the heart is not possessed
   with the life and power of it. Those are intended in Rom. ii. 20, An
   instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which have the form of
   knowledge and of the truth in the law.' And such are described 2 Tim.
   iii. 8, Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.' It
   is not to be imagined that this is always in design, though many times
   carnal men swim with the stream, and take up with the opinions that are
   current in their age; but also out of conviction of judgment; there is
   somewhat of conscience in it. A sound judgment is a different thing
   from a sound heart. The truths of God have great evidence with them;
   and therefore a rational man, being helped with some common work of the
   Spirit, may close with them, though they have no experience of the
   power and prevailing influence of them.

   (4.) Besides this dogmatical knowledge, by which we see round about the
   compass of truths revealed in the word, there is a gracious
   illumination when men are taught so as drawn to God, John vi. 44, 45,
   and they do so understand Christ's doctrine as to apply and make a
   right use of it; such a knowledge as is called not only sight, but
   taste: 1 Peter ii. 3, If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is
   gracious;' and a feeling of what we understand: Phil. i. 9, And this I
   pray, that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and in all
   judgment.' This sense and experimental knowledge is that which the
   saints seek after.

   [2.] The uses of this spiritual illumination.

   (1.) To give us a clear sight of the truths of God.

   (2.) An applicative sight.

   (3.) An affective sight.

   (4.) A transforming sight.

   (5.) Such a sense of the truth as is prevalent over lusts and
   interests.

   (1.) A clear sight of the truths of God. Others have but an hear say
   knowledge, gathered out of books and sermons, and the common report
   which is made of Christ; but he that is divinely enlightened drinks of
   the fountain, and so his draught is more fresh and sweet. They do not
   talk of things by rote after others, but it is written upon their
   hearts: Heb. viii. 10, I will put my laws into their mind, and write
   them in their hearts;' and so groweth more intimate and satisfactory,
   and moving upon them.

   (2.) An applicative sight; not only knowledge, but prudence: Prov.
   viii. 12, I, Wisdom, dwell with Prudence.' Wisdom is the know ledge of
   principles; prudence is an ability to apply them to our comfort and
   use, that we may know It for our good, Job v. 28. Many are right in
   generals; but the Spirit doth not only reveal the truths of the gospel,
   but applieth those truths to awaken the conscience that was asleep in
   sin. Many men that are unrenewed may be stored with general truths
   concerning the misery of man, redemption by Christ, the privileges of a
   Christian; but they do not reflect the light of these truths upon
   themselves, so as to consider their own case; and so it serveth rather
   for matter of opinion and discourse than for life and conversation; it
   is not directive.

   (3.) An affective sight: Prov. ii. 10, When wisdom entereth upon thy
   heart,' which is the seat of affections, it stirs up in the soul answer
   able motions to every truth; whereas when truths rest in empty barren
   notions, without feeling and an answerable touch upon the heart, the
   knowledge of them is like a winter's sun, that shineth, but warmeth
   not; the misery of man is not affective, and doctrines of redemption by
   Christ are apprehended without any joy and relish.

   (4.) A transforming sight: 2 Cor. iii. 18, We all, with open face
   beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the
   same image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.' It
   is a light that is both directive and persuasive. A man may hear the
   gospel nomikos, when it is only known as a rule, not as a means to
   convey the Spirit; whereas a believer hears the law euangelikos. The
   apostle preferreth the gospel above the law in the afore-mentioned
   place, for comfortableness, perspicuity, efficacy, &c.

   (5.) It is a light that prevaileth over our lusts and interest, such a
   light as hath fire in it to destroy lusts: 1 John ii. 3, 4, He that
   saith I know him, and doth not keep his commandments, is a liar.' A
   true knowledge and sight of God is able to bridle lusts and purify the
   conscience. Therefore it is said, He that doth evil hath not seen God,'
   3 John 11; hath not a true sight, whatever speculations he may have
   about the nature of God. Other light doth not check and control vicious
   desires; reason is not restored to its dominion: Rom. i. 18, the
   reputed wise men of the world held the truth in unrighteousness.' Truth
   may talk its fill, but can do nothing; as a man that is bound hand and
   foot may rave and evaporate his passions,' but cannot relieve himself
   from the oppressor or the force that he is under.

   Secondly, Reasons that show the necessity of this work.

   1. Spiritual blindness is natural to us, as that man that was blind
   from his birth, John ix. 1. We are not all born blind in body, but all
   in mind. By tasting the tree of knowledge, all Adam's sons have lost
   their knowledge. Satan hath brought a greater shame upon us than Nahash
   the Ammonite would have brought upon the men of Jabesh-Gilead in
   putting out their right eyes. The eye of the soul is put out, so as we
   cannot see the light that shineth in the word. By the fall we lost the
   true and perfect light of reason, but retain the pride of reason. It is
   no small part of our blindness that we cannot endure to hear of it:
   Rev. iii. 17, Thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and
   have need of nothing: and knowest not that thou art wretched, and
   miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.' Man desireth to be thought
   sinful rather than weak, and will sooner own a wickedness in morals
   than a weakness in intellectuals. Men are dishonest out of choice, and
   therefore think there is more of liberty and bravery in it; but to be
   simple argueth imperfection; Job xi. 12, Vain man would be accounted
   wise, though man be born like a wild-ass's colt;' not only for
   untamedness and affectation of liberty, but for rudeness and grossness
   of conceit; yet man would be accounted wise. The Pharisees took it ill
   that Christ charged them with blindness: John ix. 40, Are we blind
   also?' We all affect the reputation of wisdom, more than the reality;
   that is the reason why we are so touchy in point of error; we can
   easier brook a sin reproved than an error taxed. Till we have spiritual
   eye-salve, we do not know it, and will not hear of this blindness, Rev.
   iii. 17. It is a degree of spiritual knowledge to know that we know
   nothing.

   2. Observe how much spiritual blindness is worse than bodily. Those
   that are under bodily blindness are glad of a remedy, glad of a guide.

   [1.] Glad of a remedy. How feelingly doth that man speak, Mark x. 51,
   What wouldst thou have me to do? Lord, that mine eyes may be opened.'
   Those that are blind spiritually are not for a remedy; not only
   ignorant, but unteachable; and so their blindness groweth upon them; to
   their natural, there is an adventitious blindness. If we cannot keep
   out the light, we rage against it.

   [2.] Glad of a guide; as Elymas the sorcerer, when he was stricken
   blind, looked about for somebody to lead him by the hand, Acts xiii.
   11. But the blind world cannot endure to be directed, or the blind lead
   the blind, and both fall into the ditch.' He that prophesieth of strong
   wine is the teacher of this people, saith the prophet. Men love those
   that gratify their lusts and humours: let one come soundly, and declare
   the counsel and will of God to them, he is distasted.

   3. We cannot help ourselves out of this misery without God's help. Our
   incapacity is best understood by opening that noted place, 1 Cor. ii.
   14, The natural man receiveth not the things that are of God, for they
   are folly to him; neither can he know them, because they are
   spiritually discerned.' Let us a little open that place: a'nthropos
   psu'chikos, the soully man,' that is, a man considered in his pure
   naturals. Jude 19; psuchikoi, pneuma me' echontes, sensual, having not
   the Spirit.' However, he useth the best word by which a natural man can
   be described; he doth not say sa'rkikoi, not only those that are
   brutish and depraved by vicious habits, but take nature in its
   excellency, soul-light in its highest splendour and perfection, though
   the man be not absolutely given up to vile affections. Well, it is said
   of him that he neither doth nor can receive the things of God, ou
   de'chetai, and ou du'natai gnonai. The ta` tou pneu'matos, the things
   of the Spirit,' are such truths as depend upon mere revelation, and are
   above the reach and knowledge of nature. There are ta` tou Theou,
   things of God,' that may be known by a natural light: Rom. i. 19, That
   which may be known of God, is manifest in them, for God hath showed it
   unto them;' but ta` tou pneu'matos, things revealed in the word, though
   a natural man be able to understand the phrases and sentences, and be
   able to discourse of them, yet he wanteth faith, and a spiritual sense
   and relish of them; they are folly to him. It noteth the utter contempt
   of spiritual things by a carnal heart, who looketh upon redemption by
   Christ crucified, with the consequent benefits, as things frivolous and
   vain. Paul at Athens was accounted a babbler,' Acts xvii. 18. The same
   disposition is still in natural men; for though these truths, by the
   prescription and consent of many ages, have now obtained veneration and
   credit, yet carefully to observe them, to live to the tenor of them,
   whatever hazards and inconveniences we are exposed to in the world, is
   still counted foolish. Mark, for greater emphasis, it is mori'a, folly,
   as carnal wisdom is e'chthra, enmity against God.' Rom. viii. 7.
   Neither can he know them.' It is out of sloth and opposition and moral
   impotency; as it is said, Rom. viii. 7, The carnal mind is enmity
   against God, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed
   can it be.' Reason is a short and defective light, not only actually
   ignorant, but unable to conceive of them. It is not only through
   negligence he doth not, but through weakness he cannot. Take mere
   nature in itself, and, like plants neglected, it soon runs wild; as the
   nations barbarous and not polished with arts and civility have more of
   the beast than the man in them: Jude 10, But what they know naturally,
   as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.' Suppose they
   use the spectacles of art, and the natural light of reason be helped by
   industry and learning, yet how erroneous in things of religion: Rom. i.
   21, When they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were
   thankful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish
   hearts were darkened,' &c. The most civil nations were most foolish in
   matters of worship; and many placed fevers, and human passions, and
   every paltry thing, among the gods. The Scythians worshipped thunder,
   the Persians the sun; the most stupid and blockish nations seemed most
   wise in the choice of their gods; others were given up to more gross
   superstitions. All the arts in the world could not fully repair the
   ruins of the fall. The heathens invented logic for polishing reason;
   grammar and rhetoric for language; for government, and as a help to
   human society, laws; for bodily necessities, physic; for mollifying and
   charming the passions, so far as concerned human conversation, ethics;
   for families and private societies, economics: but for the soul and
   religious concernments, how blind and foolish were they! Nay, go
   higher. Suppose, besides the spectacles of art, nature be furnished
   with the glass of the word; yet John i. 5, The light shined in
   darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not.' We see how great
   scholars are defective in the most useful and practical points.
   Nicodemus, a teacher in Israel, was ignorant of regeneration, John iii.
   10. They always err in one point or another. And in these things of
   moment, if they get an opinion and a dogmatical faith, and have an
   exact model and frame of truth, yet as long as they are carnal and
   unregenerate, how much doth a plain godly Christian exceed them in
   lively affection and serious practice! And whilst they are disputing of
   the natures and offices of Christ, and the nature of justification and
   sanctification, others enjoy what they speak of, and have a greater
   relish and savour and power of these truths upon their hearts. For ever
   it was a truth, and ever will be, Rom. viii. 5, They that are after the
   flesh, do mind the things of the flesh; and they that are after the
   Spirit, the things of the Spirit.' Nature can go no farther than
   itself, than a fleshly inclination moveth it. They have not this
   transforming light, and that sense of religion which is prevalent over
   lusts and worldly interests.

   The next reason is, because they must be spiritually discerned;' that
   is, to know them inwardly, thoroughly, and with some relish and savour;
   there must be a higher light, there must be a cognation and proportion
   between the object and the faculty. Divine things must be seen by a
   divine light, and spiritual things by a spiritual light. Sense, which
   is the light of beasts, cannot trace the workings or flights of reason
   in her contemplations. We cannot see a soul or an angel by the light of
   a candle; so fleshly wisdom cannot judge of divine things. The object
   must be not only revealed, but we must have an answerable light; so
   that when you have done all, you must say, How can I understand without
   an interpreter?' Acts viii. 31. And this interpreter must be the Spirit
   of God--Ejus est interpretari, cujus est condere. To discern, so as to
   make aright judgment and estimate of things, dependeth upon God's help.

   4. When this blindness is in part cured, yet still we need that God
   should open our eyes to the very last. We know nothing as we ought to
   know. David, a regenerate man, and well instructed, prayeth to have his
   eyes opened; for we need more light every day: Luke xxiv. 45, Then
   opened he their understandings, that they might understand the
   scriptures.' Christ first opened the scriptures, then he opened their
   understandings.

   Use 1. To show us the reason why the word prevaileth so little when it
   is preached with power and evidence; their eyes are not opened: Isa.
   liii. 1, Who hath believed our report; and to whom is the arm of the
   Lord revealed?' No teaching will prevail till we are taught of God.

   Use 2. What need we have to consult with God, whenever we make use of
   the word, in reading, hearing, study. In reading, when thou openest the
   Bible to read, say, Lord, open mine eyes.' When thou nearest, beg a
   sight of the truth, and how to apply it for thy comfort. Haec audiunt
   quasi somniantes, Luther saith of the most--in seeing they see not, in
   hearing they hear not. There was a fountain by Hagar, but she could not
   see it: Gen. xxi. 19, God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water,
   and she went and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad to
   drink.' So for study; it is dangerous to set upon the study of divine
   things in the strength of wit and human helps. Men go forth in the
   strength of their own parts, or lean upon the judgment of writers, and
   so are left in darkness and confusion. We would sooner come to the
   decision of a truth if we would go to God, and desire him to rend the
   veil of prejudices and interests.

   Use 3. Is to press us to seek after this blessing, the opening of the
   eyes. Magnify the creating power of God: 2 Cor. iv. 6, God, who
   commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our
   hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of God in the face of Jesus
   Christ.' Make use of Christ: Col. ii. 3, In whom are hid all the
   treasures of wisdom and knowledge;' beg it earnestly of him. The
   apostle prayeth, Eph. i. 17, 18, That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,
   the leather of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and
   revelation in the knowledge of him; the eyes of your understanding
   being en lightened, that ye may know what is the hope of his calling,'
   &c. Yea, mourn for it in cases of dubious anxiety. John wept when the
   book of the seven seals was not opened, Rev. v. 4. Mourn over your
   ignorance; refer all to practice: John vii. 17, If any man will do his
   will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I
   speak of myself.' Wait for light in the use of means, with a simple,
   docile, sincere, humble mind: Ps. xxv. 9, The meek will he guide in
   judgment, and the meek will he teach his way.'

   Doct. 2. Those whose eyes are opened by God, they see wondrous things
   in his word, more than ever they thought.

   Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.'
   Law is not taken strictly for the covenant of works, nor for the
   decalogue as a rule of life; but more generally for the whole word of
   God, which is full of wonders, or high and heavenly mysteries. In the
   decalogue or moral law there is wonderful purity, when we get a
   spiritual sense of it: Ps. cxix. 96, I have seen an end of all
   perfection; but thy commandments are exceeding broad;' and Ps. xix. 7,
   8, The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony
   of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple: the statutes of the Lord
   are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure,
   enlightening the eyes.' A wonderful equity: Rom. vii. 12, The law is
   holy, and the commandment is holy, just, and good.' A marvellous
   wisdom: Deut. iv. 6, Keep therefore, and do them; for this is your
   wisdom and understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear
   all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and
   understanding people.' In the whole word of God, the harmony and
   correspondence between all the parts, how the mystery grew from a dark
   revelation to clearer, is admirable. In the gospel, every article of
   faith is a mystery to be wondered at. The person of Christ: 1 Tim. iii.
   16, Great is the mystery of godliness, God manifested in the flesh,
   justified in the Spirit,' &c. A virgin conceiveth, the Word is made
   flesh, the redemption and reconciliation of mankind, are the wonderful
   works of the Lord's grace. It is the hidden wisdom of God in a
   mystery,' 1 Cor. ii. 7. We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even
   the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world to our glory;'
   and it is called the mystery hidden from ages,' Eph. iii. 9. The glory
   of heaven is admirable: Eph. i. 18, The riches of the glory of the
   inheritance of the saints in light.' That a clod of earth should be
   made an heir of heaven, deserves the highest wonder. All these are
   mysteries. So the wonderful effects of the word in convincing sinners:
   1 Cor. xiv. 25, Thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so
   falling down on his face, he will worship God, and report that God is
   in you of a truth,' Heb. iv. 12: The word of God is quick and powerful,
   sharper than a two-edged sword, piercing to the dividing asunder of
   soul and spirit and joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the
   thoughts and intents of the heart.' It is a searching and discovering
   word: John iv. 29, See a man that hath told me all that ever I did.' In
   changing sinners: 1 Peter ii. 9, That ye may show forth the praises of
   him that hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light,'
   Peter's getting out of prison was nothing to it. In comforting, every
   grace is a mystery, to depend upon what we see not, to be as a rock in
   the midst of a storm. Dying, yet we live; as poor, yet making many
   rich.' 2 Cor. vi. 9, 10. All the operations of the Spirit are
   wonderful: 1 Peter i. 8, Joy unspeakable and full of glory,' Phil. iv.
   7, Peace that passeth all understanding;' Rom. viii. 26, Groans that
   cannot be uttered.'

   And now, what divine illumination contributeth to the sight of these
   wonders?

   1. It revealeth the truth of them, which otherwise is incomprehensible
   to the flesh: Mat. xvi. 17, Flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto
   thee, but my Father which is in heaven.' Without this, no certain
   knowledge of Christ's person and office.

   2. It more intimately acquainteth us with them: Mat. xiii. 11, To you
   it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God; to others it
   is not given.' All God's works are full of wonder, yet blind men cannot
   see them, though the sun shineth never so clearly. A beautiful room
   into which there is but a crevice, when we lay our eye close to it, we
   see it

   Use 1. From hence we may learn, that it is one degree of profit to see
   so much in the word of God as to admire it; either at the mysteries of
   godliness or ungodliness, which the word discovereth, o ba'thos. They
   that are most enlightened have most cause to wonder; for then they find
   truths which exceed all common reason, such as do not come into the
   minds of others, or, if they do, they seem incredible.

   Use 2 is to encourage us to study the word; the wonders of God's works
   are many, but the wonders of his word greater. Quot articuli, tot
   miracula, the Papists say of Aquinas's Sums; but more truly may it be
   said of the word of God; all the doctrines of the word are a continued
   mystery. After man was fallen, it came not into the head of any
   creature how to satisfy justice, to make up the breach. Oh, the folly
   of them that despise the word, as curious wits and world lings do, as
   if it were a mean knowledge in comparison of what may be acquired from
   Aristotle and Plato or the politicians of the world! If there be in it
   some rudiments, something common with other writings, yet there are
   greater things than these: The deep things of God,' 1 Cor. ii. 11;
   never such a revelation made to the world. And worldly men, that
   despise this study of the word, they despise that which angels wonder
   at, Eph. iii. 10, and desire to pry into,' 1 Peter i. 12, and make
   great matters of trifles. The Sun of righteousness, is not he worth the
   beholding?

   Use 3. Let us cease wondering at worldly things, great places, honours,
   heaps of wealth, fair buildings, as the disciples, Mark xiii. 1, Mas
   ter, see what manner of stones and buildings are here!' It is said of
   Christ, Col. ii. 9, In him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead
   bodily!' Fulness of the Godhead! oh, wonderful! The people wondered at
   that mass of money provided by David to build God a house, 1 Chron.
   xxix. 7, 8. Oh! but the unsearchable riches of grace, the rare plot of
   man's redemption, me'ga muste'rion, how wonderful! All in and about
   Christ is rare. His name is Wonderful. All the promises of God are ta`
   me'gista kai` ti'mia epange'lmata, exceeding great and precious
   promises,' 2 Peter i. 4; they transcend man's capacity. It condemneth
   the stupidness of them that are nothing moved or taken with things so
   great and wonderful--great in themselves, and should be precious to us.

SERMON XX.

   I am a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from me.--Ver.
   19.

   IN the 18th verse David had begged divine illumination, Open mine
   eyes,' &c. He doth not desire God to make a plainer law, but to give
   him a clearer sight. That request he backs with three reasons in the
   following verses:--

   1. His condition in the world, I am a stranger in the earth.' Strangers
   in a foreign country need guidance and direction.

   2. His earnest affection to the word, ver. 20, My soul breaketh for the
   longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times.' David had an
   earnest longing to be acquainted more with the will of God.

   3. God's judgments upon those that contemn the word, Thou hast rebuked
   the proud that are cursed, which do err from thy commandments.' It is
   dangerous to walk beside the rule: Rom. i. 18, The wrath of God is
   revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of
   men,' &c. God hath owned both tables; he hath punished ungodliness, a
   violation of the first table; and unrighteousness, a violation of the
   second table. Here God hath declared how he will own his name,
   therefore he begs illumination.

   Now, the text giveth you this first reason, his condition in the world.

   Here observe two things:--

   1. A representation of his case, I am a stranger upon earth.

   2. His request to God, hide not thy commandments from me.

   First, A representation of his case with respect to his quality,--what
   he was, a stranger; and the place where, upon earth; not in heaven, he
   was familiar there. And how a stranger upon earth, in point of
   happiness,--I do not find here that which satisfieth my soul; he had
   his home, his rest elsewhere; but not in point of service, for he had
   much work to do.

   Doct. God's children are strangers upon earth, and do so account
   themselves.

   They live here as others do, but they are not at home; their hearts are
   above, they do not take up their rest here; they are strangers, and
   account themselves to be so when they have most of worldly
   conveniences.

   First, To open it. Sometimes it may be understood in a literal sense,
   and sometimes in a moral.

   (1.) Sometimes in a literal sense. Thus the patriarchs, that had a
   wandering life, and were forced to flit from place to place without any
   certain abode, they confessed themselves to be strangers. Jacob saith,
   Gen. xlvii. 9, Few and evil have the years of my life been.' (2.)
   Morally also, and more generally, it is true of the saints, they are
   strangers. In some sense it is true of good and bad. We are all
   travelling into another world, and are every day nearer to eternity. As
   in a ship, whether men sleep or wake, stand or sit, whether they think
   of it, yea or nay, the voyage still goes onward. So, whatever we think,
   and whatever we do, we hasten towards death. In this sense even wicked
   men may be strangers and pilgrims in condition, though not in
   affection. All men in condition, will they nill they, must into the
   other world, as they yield to the decays of nature, and every day they
   are a step nearer to their long home. Heathens have had a sense of this
   notion. Saith one of them, Ex hac vita discedo tanquam ex hospitio, non
   tanquam ex domo--I go out of this life as out of an inn. Here we are
   but passengers, not inhabitants to dwell. But now to be strangers and
   pilgrims in affection, that is proper to the children of God; Heb. xi.
   13-15, it is made the fruit of their faith; Because they were persuaded
   of the promises, therefore they confessed themselves pilgrims and
   strangers on earth.' The voice of nature saith, It is good to be here;
   let God do with heaven what he pleaseth. Natural men are contented with
   their present portion, and cannot endure to think of change; and
   therefore, though they are travelling to eternity, yet they are not
   pilgrims in affection. But now God's children are so in condition and
   in affection too; they count heaven their home, and the world to be a
   strange place. They are pilgrims in affection in a threefold regard:--

   1. Because they are most sensible of their frailty. The frailty of the
   present life is a common lesson, but not easily believed. None have
   such a sense of it upon their hearts as they that are taught by God:
   Ps. xc. 12, So teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts
   unto wisdom;' and, Teach me to know how frail I am,' saith David.
   Worldly men, though they are of this opinion, and can not deny it, yet
   they do not consider it; in seeing they see not; their minds are taken
   up with other things; they are not sensible.

   2. The term is proper to the children of God, because they are un
   satisfied with their present estate; they would not abide here for ever
   if God would give them leave. Wicked men are pilgrims against their
   will; but saints are ever looking for, longing for, groaning for a
   better estate: Rom. viii. 23, We which have the first-fruits of the
   Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the
   adoption, the redemption of our body.' They desire and groan to be
   clothed upon,' 2 Cor. v. 2.

   3. The notion is most proper to them, because they have an interest in
   a better inheritance. Wicked men are sure to go out of the world, but
   they are not sure to go to heaven. Now, the children of God they know
   there is an inheritance kept for them; here they have the right, but
   there they shall have the possession, 1 John iii. 1. So that well might
   I form the point thus: That godly men are, and count themselves to be,
   strangers and pilgrims upon earth. Others are in a journey, but they
   are not sensible of it, and they have no home to go to, and no desire
   to part with the world.

   Now take some instances of this. That this is proper to God's children
   to count the world a strange place, and heaven to be their home. Those
   that had the best right and the greatest possessions here, they will do
   so; those that had the greatest right: Heb. xi. 9, Abraham sojourned in
   the land of promise as in a strange country.' What right could there be
   greater than that which was demised and made over to him by God? Yet in
   the land of promise he lived as in a strange place. So David here, and
   in other places, that had so ample a possession; he was king over, an
   opulent and flourishing kingdom; yet, Ps. xxxix. 12, I am a stranger
   with thee, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.' Not only he that
   was a wandering partridge, and flitted up and down; but David that was
   settled in a throne, he that was so powerful and victorious a prince.
   But you will say, Possibly David might speak thus when he was chased
   like a flea upon the mountains, when he was hunted to and fro like a
   partridge. No; but when he had peace, and was fully settled in the
   throne; when he could offer so many cart-loads of gold and silver, 2
   Chron. xxix. 13; then he doth acknowledge, Lord, I am a stranger.'
   Jesus Christ, who was Lord paramount, he tells us, I am not of this
   world,' John xvii. 14. He was a stranger to his brethren, and an alien
   among his mother's children,' Ps. lxix. 8. He that was Lord of all had
   neither house nor home. He passed through the world to sanctify it for
   a place of service; but his heart and constant residence was not here,
   to fix it as in a place of rest. And so all that are Christ's have the
   spirit of Christ, and say, as David in the text, I am a stranger upon
   earth.' We do not dwell upon earth, but only pass through it.

   But why do the children of God count themselves to be strangers here?

   1. They are born elsewhere. Everything tends to the place of their
   original, as men love their native soil; things bred in the water
   return thither; inanimate things tend to their centre; a stone will
   fall to the ground, though it be broken in pieces with the fall; wind
   that is imprisoned in the bowels of the earth raiseth terrible
   convulsions and earthquakes until it get up to its own place. All
   things seek to return thither from whence they came. And so grace,
   which came from heaven, it carrieth the soul thither again: Jerusalem
   from above is the mother of us all.' Heaven is our native country, and
   therefore thither is the tendency and aim of the gracious soul that is
   born from above. It is very notable that contempt of the world is
   usually made the fruit of our regeneration: 1 John v. 4, Whosoever is
   born of God overcometh the world;' and 2 Peter i. 4, Made partakers of
   the divine nature, that we might escape the corruptions of the world
   through lust.' There is somewhat of God in it then; and that which
   comes from God carries the soul thither where God is. In the new nature
   there is a strong inclination which disposeth us to look after another
   world; therefore it is said, Begotten to a lively hope,' 1 Peter i. 3.
   As soon as we are made children, we begin to look after a child's
   portion. There is another aim when we are born again; then the heart is
   carried out to God.

   2. There lies their inheritance: Eph. i. 3, Blessed be the God and
   Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual
   blessings in heavenly places.' Why! he hath blessed us with spiritual
   blessings in earthly places. Why is it said only in heavenly places'?
   There was their beginning, and there is their accomplishment. The main
   thing Christ aimed at was that we might be translated to heavenly
   places. Christ will set us high enough, and therefore he will not give
   us our portion in the world; that is an un quiet place. Here we are not
   out of gunshot and harm's way. He would not give it us in an earthly
   paradise; there Adam enjoyed God among beasts. He would give it us in
   the most glorious manner, that we might enjoy God among the angels. The
   world is not a fit place. Here God will show his bounty to all his
   children. It is a common inn, where sons and bastards are entertained;
   a place of trial, not of recompense; God's footstool, and not his
   throne, Isa. lxvi. 1. The world is Satan's walk, the devil's circuit:
   Whence comest thou? From compassing the earth,' Job i. A place defiled
   with sin, Isa. xxiv. 5; given to the children of men,' Ps. cxv. 16.
   Here God will show his bounty to all his creatures, to beasts, and to
   all kinds of men. It is sometimes the slaughter-house and shambles of
   the saints: they are slain upon earth,' Rev. xviii. 24; a receptacle
   for elect and repro bate. Therefore here they have not their blessing;
   our inheritance lies elsewhere.

   3. There are all our kindred. Ubi pater, ibi patria--where our father
   is, there our country is. Now when we pray, we say to him, Our Father
   which art in heaven.' There are we strangers, where we are absent from
   God, Christ, and glorified saints; and while we are here upon earth we
   have not such enjoyment of God. There is our Father; it is his house.
   Heaven is called our Father's house; and there is our elder brother:'
   Col. iii. 1, Set your hearts upon things above, where Christ is sitting
   at the right hand of God;' and there is the best of our kindred and
   family: They shall sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,' Mat. viii.
   11. Well, then, the children of God, they count themselves to be
   strangers here, because their kindred are elsewhere.

   4. There they abide longest. That we account our home where we abide.
   An inn cannot be called our home, where we come but for a night, and
   away; but now there we are for ever with the Lord.' Here we are in
   motion, there in rest. The world must be surely left. If we had a
   certain term of years fixed, yet it would be very short in comparison
   of eternity. All the time we spend here it is but a night, but a
   moment, in comparison of eternity. We live longest in the other world,
   and therefore there is our home: Micah ii. 10, Arise, depart hence;
   this is not your rest.' God speaks it of the land of Canaan, when they
   had polluted it with sin. It is true of all the world. Sin hath brought
   in death, and there must be a riddance. It is but a passage from
   danger. Israel dwelt first in a wandering camp, before they came to
   dwell in cities and walled towns; and the apostle alludes to that, Here
   we have no abiding city; we look for one to come.' As the Israelites
   did look for walled towns and cities of the Amorites to be possessed by
   them, so here we have but a wandering camp, we look for a city. And
   mark, as it was with them in their outward estate, so in the mysteries
   of their religion; they were first seated in a tabernacle, and then in
   a temple: in a tabernacle, which was a figure of the church; then in a
   temple, which was a figure of heaven; for you know, as in the temple
   there were three partitions--the outward court, the holy place, and the
   holy of holies--so there are three heavens. The third heaven Paul
   speaks of--the heaven of heavens'; and there is the starry heaven, and
   the airy heaven, the outward court. This life being so frail, so
   fickle, we can not call our abode here our home. What is your life?'
   saith the apostle; it is but as a vapour,' James iv. 14; a little warm
   breath turned in and out by the nostrils: Job vii. 1, Is there not an
   ap pointed time for man upon earth? His days are as the days of an
   hireling.' A hired servant you do not intend should live with you for
   ever; you hire him for a day or two, and when he hath ended his work,
   he receives his wages and is gone. So all our days are but a little
   while; we do our service, and then we must be gone. Actors, when they
   have finished their parts, are seen no more. They go within the
   curtain. So when we have fulfilled our course, God furnisheth the world
   with a new scene of acts and actors.

   5. The necessary exercise of their graces doth make them count their
   lives here but a pilgrimage, and themselves but strangers upon earth,
   viz., faith, love, hope.

   [1.] Faith shows the truth and the worth of things to come. Faith will
   make them strangers: Heb. xi. 13, They saw these things and were
   persuaded of them, and they counted themselves pilgrims and strangers.'
   Oh! were we persuaded of things to come, we would be hasting towards
   them. We cry, Home, home! We talk of heaven and eternity, but we do not
   believe them. Sense and reason cannot out-see time, nor look above the
   clouds and mists of the lower world, afar off,' in the apostle's
   phrase, 2 Peter i. 9; but faith shows the truth of things to come. We
   that are here upon earth, when we look to heaven, the stars seem to us
   but so many spangles. Oh! but when we get into heaven and look
   downward, the world then will seem but as a molehill. That which now to
   sense seems such a glorious thing will be as nothing.

   [2.] The love of Christ which is in the saints makes them to account
   themselves as strangers. A child of God cannot be satisfied with things
   here below, because his love is set upon God. Two things the heart
   looks after, as soon as it is awakened by grace, and love puts us upon
   them both, viz., a perfect enjoyment of God, and a perfect obedience to
   God. (1.) That they may be with God and Christ. The saints have heard
   much of Christ, read much of him, tasted and felt much of him; they
   would fain see him, and be with him, Phil. i. 23. If they had the
   choicest contentment the world could afford, this would not satisfy
   them so much as to be there where Christ is, and to be hold his glory.'
   The apostle thinks this to be motive enough to a gracious heart to seek
   things above, for there Christ is at the right hand of God;' love will
   catch hold of that, Col. iii. 1. The place is lovely for Christ's sake.
   Love will not suffer them to count this to be their home. Though Christ
   is present with them now spiritually while they are here, yet the
   presence and nearness is but distance, but a kind of absence, compared
   with that which is to come; and therefore this very presence doth not
   quench their desires, but kindles them, and sets them a-longing for
   more. All the presence, the communion, the sight of Christ they get
   now, is but mediate, through the glass of the ordinance, 1 Cor. xiii.
   12; and it is frequently interrupted, his face is many times hidden,
   Ps. xxx. 7; and it is not full, as it shall be there, Ps. xvi. 11. But
   now in heaven it will be immediate; God will be all in all;' and there
   it will be constant, they shall be ever with the Lord;' and there they
   shall be satisfied with his likeness,' Ps. xvii. 15; then they shall
   enjoy his presence indeed. So that love upon these considerations sets
   them a-longing and groaning. (2.) As love makes them desire the company
   of Christ, so entire subjection to God; they would have perfect grace
   and freedom from sin, therefore are ever groaning,--Oh! when shall we
   be rid of this body of death? Rom. vii. 23. There is a final perfect
   estate for which the new creature was made, and they are ever tending
   towards that happy state wherein they shall grieve God no more.

   [3.] Hope was made for things to come, especially for our full and
   final happiness. God fits us with graces as well as happiness; not only
   grants us a glorious estate, but gives us grace to expect it. Hope
   would be of no use if it did not lift up the head, and look out for a
   better estate than the world yieldeth. Hope fastens upon God's title in
   the covenant, I am thy God.' Now God could not with honour take this
   title, and give us no better than present things: Heb. xi. 16,
   Wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he hath
   prepared for them a city,' Mark the apostle's reason. Many expound
   these words so as if the meaning were but this, that they did only
   express God's condescension, that he would take his title, not from the
   potentates of the world, but from a few wandering patriarchs; that God
   was not ashamed to be called their God. Alas! the words have a quite
   other sense. Rather it expresseth an answerable bounty: unless the Lord
   would give them something answerable to their hopes, more than was
   visible in the lives of the patriarch, God would be ashamed to be
   called their God. Do but look upon the slenderness of their condition.
   If that he gave them in the world were all their reward, what is this
   to own that magnificent title, I am the God of Abraham,' &c. No; now he
   hath something better than all the honours and riches of the world; now
   he may fitly be called their God. Christ builds the doctrine of the
   resurrection upon the same argument, God is the God of Abraham,' &c.;
   therefore they shall have a blessed estate in soul and body, Mat. xxii.
   32. To be a God to any, is to be a benefactor, and that according to
   the extent and largeness of an infinite and eternal power.

   Use 1. Are you strangers and pilgrims? David, and such as he was, that
   were of his stamp, counted themselves strangers upon earth. If you be
   so--

   1. You will always be drawing home, and would not desire to stay long
   from Christ. A traveller would pass over his journey as soon as he can,
   and be hastening homeward: Phil. i. 23, I desire to be dissolved, and
   to be with Christ.' Is there any looking, longing, waiting for your
   blessed estate? It is no hard matter to get a Christian out of the
   world; his better part is gone already, his heart is there. Do your
   hearts draw homeward? Are your desires stronger and stronger every day
   after eternal life? Natural motion grows swifter and swifter still, as
   it draws nearer and nearer its centre. So certainly a Christian, if he
   had the motions of the new nature, he would be drawing homeward more
   every day.

   2. What provision do you make for another world if you are strangers?
   Many bestow all their labour and travail about earthly things, and
   neglect their precious and immortal souls. They are at home; all their
   care is that they may live well here. O Christians! what provision do
   you make for heaven? A traveller doth not buy such things as he cannot
   carry with him, as trees, houses, household stuff; but jewels, pearls,
   and such as are portable. Our wealth doth not follow us into the other
   world, but our works do. We are travelling to a country whose
   commodities will not be bought with gold and silver, and therefore are
   we storing ourselves for heaven, for such things as are current there.
   Men that make a voyage to the Indies will carry such wares as are
   acceptable there, else they do nothing. Do you make it your business
   every day to get clearer evidences for heaven, to treasure up a good
   foundation, 1 Tim. vi. 19; and do you labour every day to grow more
   meet for heaven, Col. i. 12. That is the great work of a Christian, to
   get evidences and a meetness for heaven. These are the months of our
   purification; we are now to cleanse ourselves for the embraces of the
   great God. When we grow more mortified, strict, holy, heavenly, then we
   ripen apace, and hasten home ward: Ps. lxxxiv. 7, They shall go on from
   strength to strength,' &c. Every degree of grace it is a step nearer;
   and therefore do you grow more meet for this blessed estate.

   3. In the fulness of your worldly enjoyments do you mind your country?
   He that was going pilgrim to Jerusalem, cried out, Oh, this is not the
   holy city! So, whatever enjoyments you have, do your hearts call you
   off, and say, Soul, this is not thy rest; this is not that thou
   shouldst take comfort in; thou art bound for heaven? Do you miss your
   country and your parents? The men of the world would have their portion
   here, here is their rest; but when you have most of the world at will,
   are you strangers? 1 Cor. vii. 31, Using this world as not abusing it;'
   that is, so making use of God's bounty as expecting a greater
   happiness. How do we use the world as not abusing it? When we use it as
   a type, as a motive, and as a help to heaven. As a kind of type, the
   enjoyment of temporal things should stir us up to a more serious
   consideration of heavenly; as the prodigal's husks put him in mind of
   bread in his father's house. The company of your relations puts you in
   mind of the company of God and Christ. The cities of the Amorites,
   their walled towns, put the patriarchs in mind of a city which had
   foundations, Heb. xi. 16. If an earthly city be so glorious, what is
   the heavenly city? These are the comforts of a strange place. You abuse
   them when you forget home, and therefore take heed; if the creature be
   sweet, heaven is better. And when you use them as a motive to serve God
   more cheerfully, the more you find him a good master: 1 Tim. vi. 17,
   Trust in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;' to
   make you more earnest in good works. 2 Sam. vii. 2, saith David there,
   I dwell in a house of cedar, and the ark of God within curtains.' When
   you have such kind of reasonings stirred up within you What do I for
   God, that hath enlarged my house here? And when you use them as a help,
   your worldly enjoyments as instruments of piety and. charity. Here is a
   man's trial, what he doth in a full condition, whether his heart be for
   home still, yea or nay; when he hath the world at will, if then he be
   treasuring up a good foundation, and encouraging himself to serve God
   faithfully.

   4. What is your solace in your affliction, and the inconveniences that
   you meet with in your pilgrimage? Doth this comfort you--Home will pay
   for all? Heb. x. 34, Ye took joyfully the spoiling of your goods,
   knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and enduring
   substance.' Do you reckon upon a more enduring substance? Though the
   world frown upon you as a step-mother, yet you remember you have a
   better home. From whence do you fetch your supports in any cross? Doth
   this comfort you in the midst of the molestations of the world? They do
   not know your birth, your breeding, your hopes, nor your expectations.
   Strangers may be abused in a foreign place; when we come home, this
   will be forgotten. The saints walk up and down like a prince that
   travels abroad in disguise; though he be slighted, abused, he doth not
   appear what he shall be. You have a glorious inheritance reserved for
   you; this is your cordial and the reviving of your souls, and that
   which doth your heart good to think of; and so you can be contented to
   suffer loss and inconveniences upon these hopes. The discourse between
   Modestus, a governor under Valens, and Basil, in Nazianzen his
   twentieth Oration, is very notable. I shall only transcribe what is
   exactly to the purpose in hand. When he threatened him with banishment,
   I know no banishment, saith he, who know no abiding-place here in the
   world. I do not count this place mine, nor can I say the other is not
   mine; rather all is God's, whose stranger and pilgrim I am. This was
   that which supported him in the midst of those threatenings. Therefore
   from whence do you fetch your support.

   5. If religion be kept up in height and majesty, the world will count
   you strangers, they will stand wondering at your conversation, 1 Peter
   iv. 4. Men gaze upon those that come hither in a foreign habit, that do
   not conform to the fashions of the country; and so a child of God is
   wondered at, that walks in a counter-motion to the studies and
   practices of other men, as one that is not conformed to the world, Rom.
   xii. 2. What do you discover of the spirit of your country, so as to
   convince others?

   This much by way of inquiry, namely, whether we are strangers, yea or
   nay?

   Use 2. Behave yourselves as strangers here upon earth.

   1. Avoid fleshly lusts,' 1 Peter ii. 11; these cloud the eye, and besot
   the heart, and make us altogether for a present good; they weaken our
   desires of heaven. It is the apostle's argument, As strangers and
   pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts.' The flesh-pots of Egypt made
   Israel to despise Canaan; and so this is that which will take off our
   hearts from things to come, from the inheritance of the saints in
   light, and from that blessed estate God hath promised.

   2. Grasp not at too much of the world; but what comes with a fair
   providence upon honest endeavours, accept with thanks: 1 Tim. vi. 9,
   They that will be rich, fall into temptation and a snare,' &c. The
   devil hath you upon the hip, when you make that your business and
   scope; not he that is, but will be rich, that fixes that as his scope.
   Then the heart is filled with sins, and the head with cares.

   3. If an estate comes in slowly, remember, a little will serve our
   turns to heaven; more would be but a burden and snare. Those that have
   their portion here, most of worldly things, what do they get by it? A
   little belly-cheer, Ps. xvii. 14, and they leave the rest to their
   babes.' Dainty cheer is no great matter; and to leave our posterity
   great is but to leave them in a snare. Children are under a providence
   and a covenant as well as we, and it is blasphemous to think we can
   provide for them better than God.

   4. If God give abundance, rest not in it with a carnal complacency: Ps.
   lxii. 10, If riches increase, set not your heart on them.' Suffer not
   thy heart to rejoice in them as your only portion, so as to grow proud
   of them, so as to count them your good things, Luke xvi. 25; you that
   are strangers have better things to mind.

   5. Keep up a warm respect to your everlasting home. It is not enough to
   despise the world, but you must look after a better country. Many of a
   slight temper may despise worldly profits; their corruptions do not run
   out that way: Heb. xiii. 14, We have here no abiding city, but we seek
   one to come.' Desires, thoughts, and groans, these are the harbingers
   of the soul that we send into the land of promise. By this means we
   tell God that we would be at home.

   6. Enjoy as much of heaven as you can in your pilgrimage, in
   ordinances, in the first-fruits of the Spirit, in communion with
   saints, Grace is but young glory, and joy in the Holy Ghost is the
   suburbs of heaven; and therefore you should get somewhat of your
   country before you come at it. As the winds do carry the odours and
   sweet smells of Arabia into the neighbouring provinces, so by the
   breathings of the Holy Ghost upon our hearts do we get a smell of the
   upper paradise; it is in some measure begun in us before we can get
   thither; and therefore enjoy as much of heaven as possibly you can in
   the time of your pilgrimage. We have our taste here; it is begun in
   union with Christ, and in the work of grace upon the heart. And in
   ordinances. Prayer brings us to the throne of grace; it gives us an
   entrance into God's presence: Heb. x. 19, the apostle calls it, a
   boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus.' A Christian
   enters heaven while he is here in the world. In the word preached
   heaven is brought down to us. The gospel is called the kingdom of
   heaven. And by reading we do as it were converse with the saints
   departed, that writ what we read. Meditation brings us into the company
   of God; it puts our heads above the clouds, in the midst of blessed
   spirits there. As if we saw Jesus Christ upon the throne, and his
   saints triumphing about him. Communion of saints is heaven begun;
   therefore you that are strangers should much delight there. A man that
   is abroad would be glad to meet with his own country men; we should be
   glad of company to go with us to heaven; these are to be our companions
   for evermore, therefore we should converse with them here.

   Secondly, I proceed to the latter clause, Hide not thy commandments
   from me.' Here is his request. To make short work of it, I shall
   endeavour to make out the connection and sense of these words in these
   propositions.

   1. Every man here upon earth, especially a godly man, is but a stranger
   and passenger. Every man is so in point of condition; he must go hence,
   and quit all his enjoyments in the world--wicked men whether they will
   or no; but a godly man is so in affection, and can not be satisfied
   with his present state. This I have insisted upon.

   2. It concerns him that is a stranger to look after a better and more
   durable state. Every man should do so. He that lives here for a while
   is concerned; his greatest care should be for that place where he lives
   longest; therefore eternity should be his scope. A godly man will do
   so. Those whose hearts are not set upon earthly things, they must have
   heaven. The more their affections are estranged from the one, the more
   they are taken up about the other, Col. iii. 2. Heaven and earth are
   like two scales in a balance; that which is taken from the one is put
   into the other.

   3. There is no sufficient direction how to attain this durable estate
   but in the word of God. Without this we are but like poor pilgrims and
   wayfaring men in a strange country, not able to discern the way home. A
   blessed state is only sufficiently revealed in the word: 2 Tim. i. 10,
   Life and immortality is brought to light in the gospel.' The heathens
   did but guess at it, and had some obscure sense of an estate after this
   life; but it is brought to light with most clearness in the word; so
   the way thither is only pointed out by the word. It is the word of God
   makes us wise to salvation, and our line and rule to lead us to the
   heavenly Canaan; and therefore it concerns those that look after this
   durable state, to consult with the word.

   4. There is no understanding God's word but by the light of the Spirit:
   Job xxxii. 8, There is a spirit in man; but the inspiration of the
   Almighty, that giveth understanding.' Though the word have light in it,
   yet the spirit of man cannot move till he enlightens us with that
   lively light that makes way for the dominion of the truth in our
   hearts, and conveyeth influence into our hearts. This is that light
   David begs when he saith, Hide not thy commandments from me.' David was
   not ignorant of the ten commandments, of their sound; but he begs their
   spiritual sense and use.

   5. If we would have the Spirit, we must ask it of God in prayer; for
   God gives the Spirit to those that ask him,' Luke xi. 13; and therefore
   we must say, as David, Ps. xliii. 3, Oh, send out thy light and thy
   truth: let them lead me; let them bring me to thy holy hill, to thy
   tabernacle.'

   6. When we beg it of God, we must do it with submission to his
   sovereignty, and with subscription to his justice. Therefore doth David
   use this manner of speech, Hide not thy commandments from me.' God doth
   hide when he doth not open our eyes to see. Now the Lord may choose
   whether he will do this or no; for he is sovereign, and may in justice
   forbear to do so, because we have abused the light we have; it will be
   hid from us unless he reveal it. The mystery of grace is wholly at
   God's dispose; and whosoever begs it, he must refer himself to the holy
   and sovereign good pleasure of God, who may give out and withhold his
   efficacious grace according to his pleasure: Mat. xi. 25, 26, I thank
   thee, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from
   the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes; even so,
   Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.' Here is the Lord's
   sovereignty; he doth in these things as he pleaseth; therefore David
   submits to it. And then it implies, it may be just with God to leave us
   unto our natural blindness, and suffer Satan to blind us more. It is
   fully consistent with the honour of his justice; therefore it is said,
   John xii. 40, He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their hearts,'
   &c.; that is, judicially, suffering them to increase their own
   blindness by their sin; blindness, that is their sin; and the Lord may
   leave it as a judgment upon them.

   Use. Here is direction to you that know you are but pilgrims. The great
   thing you should seek after is the straightest way to heaven. If you
   have a sense of eternity, and a sense of your present frailty, you
   should look how to get home to your country. To this end--

   1. Study the word. Why? This is your antidote against infection, and a
   cordial to cheer us in the way. It is an antidote against infection: 2
   Peter i. 4, By the promises we escape the corruption that is in the
   world through lust.' The world is an infectious place; therefore you
   had need take the promises next your heart to keep your hopes alive.
   And here is your cordial to keep you from fainting, that which makes
   you to rejoice in the midst of present afflictions, Ps. cxix. 54. It is
   a cordial to cheer us up, to revive us in the way, till we come to our
   journey's end. This will make up losses, sweeten difficulties, allay
   your sorrows. Then it is your direction, the way to lead you home: Ps.
   cxix. 105, Thy word is a light to my feet and a lantern to my paths.'
   We shall soon pass over this life; all our care should be to pass it
   over well, there are so many by-paths in the world, and in a strange
   place we may soon miscarry.

   2. Entreat the Lord of his abundant grace to pity poor strangers, who
   are ignorant; and desire him he would not hide his word from you, that
   you may walk in the nearest, closest way wherein he would have you
   walk. He may hide it from you as an absolute supreme Lord, for he is
   bound to give his grace to none; and he may do it as a just judge; he
   may leave you to your own infatuations and prejudices. Say, Lord, pity
   a poor stranger and pilgrim.

   The word may be hidden two ways, and take care of both:--

   1. In point of external administration, when the powerful means are
   wanting. Oh! it is a great mark of God's displeasure, when men are
   given up by their own choice to blind guides, to those that have no
   skill or no will to edify, or no abilities rightly to divide the word
   of truth; only fill the ear with clamour and noise, but do not inform
   conscience, or move the heart by solid and powerful instruction from
   the word of God.

   2. In point of internal influence, when the comforts and quickenings of
   the Spirit are withholden: Lord, withhold not thy Spirit from me.'
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON XXI.

   My soul breaketh for the longing it hath unto thy judgments at all
   times.--Ver. 20.

   DAVID had begged divine illumination, ver. 18. The reason of his
   request was, because he was a stranger upon earth, and a stranger may
   easily be bewildered. Now here is a second reason why he would have God
   to open his eyes, because his heart was carried out with so strong an
   affection to the word. He that asketh a thing coldly doth but bespeak
   his own denial. But David was in good earnest when he prayeth for
   light; it was not a dead-hearted, perfunctory petition, but such as
   came from an ardent, strong affection, My soul breaketh,' &c.

   In the words we have--

   1. The object of David's affection, thy judgments.

   2. The quality or kind of his affection:--

   [1.] It was vehement, my soul breaketh with longing.

   [2.] It was constant, at all times.

   By misphalim, judgments, is meant the word, which is the infallible
   rule of God's proceeding with sinners.

   For the affection, I shall open that, and there first speak of the
   vehemency, My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath.' It is a
   metaphorical expression, to set forth the earnestness of his affection.
   The Septuagint renders it thus: epepo'thesen e psuche' mou to`
   epithumesai ta` kri'mata' sou--My soul coveteth to desire thy
   judgments.' Desire is the stretching forth of the soul to the thing
   desired. Now as things that are stretched out do break and crack in
   stretching; so, saith David, My soul breaketh for the longing.' Here is
   no respect to brokenness of heart in this place, it is only strength of
   desire that is expressed; and the expression is used the rather--

   1. Because affections, when strong, are painful, and affect the body
   with impressions answerable thereunto.

   2. Not only the denial, but the delay of satisfying the affection,
   increaseth the pain. When they have not what they do desire, they are
   even broken in heart; as Prov. xiii. 12, Hope deferred maketh the heart
   sick; but when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life;' like apples of
   paradise, comforting and reviving. Now the constancy and continuance of
   this desire is set forth in these words, at all times; not for a flash
   and pang, but it was the ordinary frame of his heart.

   Doct. God's children have a strong, constant, and earnest bent of
   affection towards his word.

   1. To open the nature of this affection.

   2. The reasons of it.

   First, The nature. There consider the object, the end, the properties,
   and the effects.

   1. The object of this affection is the word of God written or preached.
   As it is written in the scriptures, so it is their constant exercise to
   read it, and consult with it often: Ps. i. 2, But his delight is in the
   law of the Lord, and in his law doth he meditate day and night'; and
   Josh. i. 8, This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but
   thou shalt meditate therein day and night.' As it is preached and
   explained: they submit to God's ordinance in that also, who hath
   appointed pastors and teachers, as well as prophets and apostles: Eph.
   iv. 11--prophets and apostles to write scriptures; so pastors and
   teachers to open and apply scripture; therefore James i. 19, they are
   swift to hear;' that is, take all occasions for that end and purpose.

   2. For the end of this affection; it is a sanctified subjection to God;
   and strength and growth in the spiritual life: 1 Peter ii. 2, As
   new-born babes desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow
   thereby;' not merely that you may know, but that you may grow thereby;
   not to replenish the head with notions, but that you may increase in
   spiritual strength, and find more liberty of heart towards God.

   3. For the properties of it. You have them here in the text:--

   [l.] They must be earnest.

   [2.] A constant bent of heart.

   [1.] An earnest bent of heart. Common and ordinary affection or desire
   after the word will not serve the turn; not a faint and cold wish, but
   such as hath heat and warmth in it. It is good to see by what
   expressions the desires of the saints are set forth in scripture. By
   the desire of infants after the breast, 1, Peter ii. 2; they cannot
   live without it. It is set forth also by the panting of the hart after
   the water-brooks, Ps. xlii. 1. To meet with God in his word is as a
   brook of water to a chased hart; it refresheth and revives it. It is
   set forth by the desires of a longing woman, ver. 40 of this psalm,
   Behold I have longed after thy precepts.' The children of God are fond
   of nothing so much as of his word and ordinances. It is set forth by
   the appetite which a hungry man hath toward his meat after a long
   abstinence: Ps. lxxxiv. 2, My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth, for the
   courts of the Lord.' Or, as a weary traveller and thirsty man longeth
   after drink: Ps. lxiii. 1, My soul thirsteth for thee,' &c. Or. as cool
   air to the weary: Ps. cxix. 131, I opened my mouth and panted; for I
   longed for thy commandments;' a metaphor taken from a man tired with
   running, gaping for breath to take in some cool air and refreshing.
   What think you of all these expressions? are they strains and reaches
   of wit, or the real experiences of the children of God? The truth is,
   we have such languid motions this way, that we know not how to
   understand the force of such expressions, therefore we think them to be
   conceits, we that are so cold and indifferent whether we meet with God
   in his word, yea or nay.

   [2.] As it is not cold, so it is not fleeting, but constant. Many men
   have good affections for a while, but they abide not; as I shall give
   you some kinds.

   (1.) Some out of error in judgment think the word of God is only fit
   for novices (as the Stancarists [7] ), to enter us into the rudiments
   of religion, but too low a dispensation for our after growth. It is
   milk for babes, they think; but afterwards we must live immediately
   upon the Spirit. But we see that David's affection ever carried him to
   the word, not only at his first acquaintance with God, but at all
   times, as in the text.

   (2.) Some prize the word in adversity, when they have no other comforts
   to live upon; then they can be content to study the word to comfort
   them in their distresses; but when they are well at ease they despise
   it. But David made use of it at all times; in prosperity, to humble
   him; in adversity, to comfort him; in the one, to keep him from pride;
   in the other, to keep him from despair: in affliction the word was his
   cordial; in worldly increase it was his antidote; and so at all times
   his heart was carried out to the word either for one necessity or
   another.

   (3.) Some during a qualm of conscience have an affection for holy
   things; as we desire strong waters in a pang, not for a constant diet.
   While the terrors of God are upon them, nothing will satisfy them but
   the word: Oh, send for Moses and Aaron,' then when the plague was upon
   them; but as their trouble wears off, so doth their affection to the
   word of God. It is fear that drives them to the word, and not love.

   (4.) Some out of a general sense of the excellency that is in the word;
   they go on smoothly for a while, as Herod, who heard gladly, Mark vi.
   20. So do many till the word come to cross their lusts and touch their
   darling sin, then they run to earthly pleasures again, and out of a
   sense of difficulty and carnal despondency, they give over the pursuit.

   (5.) Some are taken with the mere novelty: John v. 35, Ye were willing
   to rejoice in his light for a season;' while the doctrine is novel, and
   ministers have countenance from great men, as John had from Herod, and
   their gifts are in the flourish--none but John in their account; but
   when the conceit of novelty was gone, and John fell under the cross,
   then their affection was spent.

   (6.) Some in case of dubious anxiety, or in doubtful debates, may
   desire to know the truth, and be much and earnest in the study of the
   word; but when they get above their scruples, and in plain truths,
   ordinary cases, they neglect it. Whereas David longed for the word of
   God at all times, to feel the power of God accompanying it, so as to
   find strength against his corruptions, and that he might be established
   in waiting upon God. This was the constant and stable desire of his
   soul.

   Thus you see the word of God is the object, either read or preached.
   The end of it is, that they may grow in grace, and that their hearts
   may be more subjected to God, and may be strengthened in waiting upon
   him: and the manner of this desire is vehement and constant; not at
   times; but it is the usual frame and temper of their hearts.

   4. The effects of this desire, what it worketh. I will mention but
   two:--

   [1.] It draws off the heart from other things: Ps. cxix. 136, Incline
   my heart unto thy testimonies, and not unto covetousness;' implying,
   that when the heart is drawn out after God's testimonies, it is drawn
   off from carnal pursuits. Desires are the vigorous bent of the soul,
   and therefore, as the stream of a river, they can run but one way. Our
   passionate desires of earthly things certainly will be abated if
   spiritual desires prevail in us; for being acquainted with a better
   object, they begin to disdain and loathe other things.

   [2.] It maketh us diligent and painful in the use of means, that we may
   get knowledge and strength by the word. Where strong desires are, there
   will be great endeavours: Prov. viii. 34, Watching daily at my gates,
   waiting at the posts of my doors.' A man that hath a desire after grace
   and strength by the word of God will daily be redeeming occasions of
   waiting upon God. It is but a slight wish, not serious desire, that is
   not seconded with answerable endeavours.

   Secondly, Having opened the nature of these desires, let me show the
   reasons of this vehement and constant bent of heart towards the word of
   God.

   1. Of the vehemency.

   2. Of the constancy.

   First, The reasons of this vehemency; they are these natural instinct,
   experience, and necessity.

   [1.] Natural instinct: 1 Peter ii. 2, As new-born babes desire the
   sincere milk of the word.' Children desire the dug, not by instruction,
   but by instinct, without a teacher. All creatures desire to preserve
   that life which they have; and therefore by a natural propension they
   run to that thing from whence they received life. Mere instinct
   carrieth the brute creatures to the teats of their dams; and every
   effect looks to the cause, to receive from thence its last perfection.
   Trees, that receive life from the earth and the sun, they send forth
   their branches to receive the sun, and stretch their roots into the
   earth which brought them forth. Fishes will not out of the water which
   breeds them. Chickens are no sooner out of the shell, but they shroud
   themselves under the feathers of the hen. The little lamb runs to the
   dam's teat, though there be a thousand sheep of the same wool and
   colour; as if it said, here I received that I have, and here I'll seek
   that I want. By such a native inbred desire do the saints run to God,
   to seek a supply of strength and nourishment; and the desire is very
   strong and vehement: One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I
   seek after,' &c. There were other things David might desire, but this
   one thing his heart was set upon, that he might enjoy constant
   communion with God in the use of public ordinances. What is the reason
   of this? I answer--The spiritual nature. You may as well ask what
   teacheth the young lambs to suck, as who taught the regenerate to long
   for the word. What teacheth the chicken to run under the wing of the
   hen? The cause of appetite is not persuasion and discourse, but
   inclination; not argument, but nature. Appetite is an effect of life.
   By natural tendency the new creature is carried out to its support from
   the word of God, there to be comforted and nourished. It shows that all
   who have not such a kindly appetite to the word of God, that can relish
   nothing but meats, drinks, wealth, vanity, they were never acquainted
   with this new nature.

   [2.] Experience is another cause of this desire. A child of God is not
   satisfied with a slight taste of the word, but he desires more; when he
   hath felt the comfort of it, he is still longing to receive more from
   God: James i. 18, He hath begotten us by the word of truth.' What
   follows? Wherefore be swift to hear.' A man that hath had experience of
   the power of the word taketh all occasions; he knows there is strength,
   grace, and liberty of heart to be found there. So 1 Peter ii. 3, As
   new-born babes, &c., if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is
   gracious.' Certainly a man that hath had any taste of communion with
   God will desire a fuller measure, as by tasting of excellent meats we
   get an appetite to them. Carnal men do not know what it is to enjoy God
   in ordinances, and therefore do not long for them; they do not taste
   the sweetness of the word: Ps. xix. 10, The statutes of the Lord are
   sweeter than the honey or the honeycomb.' The children of God find more
   true pleasure in the ordinances, in the statutes of God, than in all
   things in the world, though to carnal men they are but as dry sticks,
   burdensome exercises. The reason follows, ver. 11, Moreover, by them is
   thy servant warned; and in keeping of them there is great reward.' He
   commendeth the word from his own experience; he had felt the effects
   and good use of it in his own heart; he had been warned, and had a
   great deal of comfort and refreshing by it; therefore it is sweeter
   than the honey and the honeycomb. So Ps. lxiii. 1,2, O God, my soul
   thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee.' What to do? To see thy
   power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary.' He that
   hath had once a sight of God, would not be long out of his company. He
   compareth his desire of communion with God with hunger and thirst; his
   desire is greater than the hunger and thirst that men suffer in a dry
   wilderness where there is no water to give refreshment. He had seen
   God, and would now see him again; the remembrance of those former
   pleasures of the sanctuary revived his desires: so that besides nature,
   there is this experience.

   [3.] The next cause is necessity. We should take delight in the word of
   God for its excellency, though we stood in no need of it. But our
   necessity is very great, and this awakens desire. The word is not only
   compared to things which make for conveniency of life, as to wine and
   honey, but is compared also to things that are of absolute necessity,
   bread and water. It is called bread of life,' and water of life.' Bread
   of life; we cannot live without it: Job xxiii. 12, I have esteemed the
   words of thy mouth more than my necessary food.' Food is that which
   keeps us in life, and enables us to action and work. And as water: Isa.
   xii. 3, With joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.'
   This is as water to a fainting traveller. Christian, the soul is better
   than the body, and eternal life is to be preferred before life natural;
   therefore the necessities of the soul are greater, and should be more
   urging than the necessities of the body. The famine of the word is
   threatened as a very great evil, Amos viii. 11. Now because the
   necessities of the saints are so great, therefore have they their
   hearts carried out with such longing after the statutes of God. And
   this necessity is not only at first, when they are weak, but it
   continueth with them as long as the imperfection continueth with them,
   and till they come to heaven. Every grace in a child of God needs
   increase and support; there is something that is lacking to their
   faith, to their love, to their knowledge: 1 Thes. iii. 10, the apostle
   saith, That I might perfect that which is lacking to your faith.' They
   that are above ordinances are not acquainted with their own hearts,
   they are not men of spiritual experience, they do not know the
   weaknesses and languishings a child of God is incident to; it is wholly
   inconsistent to the nature of grace. Wherever there is life there must
   be food, because of the constant depastion of the natural heat upon the
   natural moisture. Though the stomach be never so full at present, yet
   anon it will be hungry again. So because of the constant combat that is
   between the flesh and spirit, wherever there is spiritual life it will
   be sensible of the necessity of food. Well, then, it is hunger and
   necessity that sharpens appetite; being sensible of spiritual
   languishing, and need to repair strength daily, therefore are their
   hearts carried out. Thus you see the reasons of this vehement
   affection.

   Secondly, The reasons of the constancy of this respect.

   1. Because it is natural and kindly to the regenerate; therefore, as it
   is vehement, so it is constant. For it is not a light motion, but such
   as is deeply rooted; not a good liking, but a thorough bent of heart;
   it is that which settleth into another nature. Now that which is as a
   nature to us is known by its uniformity and constancy.

   2. They love the word for its own sake, as it is God's word; therefore
   they ever love it. Other men love it for foreign reasons, as out of
   novelty, which is an adulterous affection; or out of public
   countenance, as it is in fashion and repute, and therefore are soon
   weary of it. He that loves a woman for foreign reasons, as beauty and
   portion, when these cease, his love ceaseth.

   Use 1. Is to reprove the coldness and cursed satiety and loathing of
   the word of God that is abroad. There is a plenty of means, even to a
   surfeit. Men are gospel-glutted, Christ-glutted, and sermon-glutted;
   and therefore are at a very great indifferency, and under a mighty
   coldness as to the word of God. Usually we are more sensible of the
   benefit of the word in the want of it than we are in the enjoyment of
   it: 1 Sam. iii. 1, The word of the Lord was precious in those days;
   there was no open vision.' When the public ministry of the prophets was
   rare and scarce, then it was precious and sweet. When the Papists
   denied the use of the scripture in the vulgar tongue, oh! what would we
   give then for a little scrap and fragment of the word of God in
   English!--a load of hay for a chapter in James. So in times of
   restraint, how savoury is a godly sermon! But now visions are open, men
   begin to surfeit of the word. In semet ipsam, saith Tertullian, semper
   abundantia contumeliosa est--plenty lesseneth the price of things. As
   in Solomon's time, gold and silver were as dirt in the streets, 1 Kings
   x. 32, so the word of God, though it be so precious and excellent, yet
   when we have plenty of it, line upon line, precept upon precept, by
   God's indulgence, then we begin to be glutted. People grow wanton when
   they have abundance of means. This is the temper of English professors
   at this day; they are guilty of surfeiting of the word, and that is
   very dangerous, either of a people or person. Now, that there is such a
   fulness and satiety appears partly--

   1. By seldom attendance upon the word. We do not redeem time to hear
   the word; when brought home to our doors, we seldom step out to hear
   it. They use to say, a surfeit of bread is most dangerous; surely a
   surfeit of the bread of life is so; when men are full, and begin to
   despise the word as if not worth the hearing. God usually sends a
   famine to correct that surfeit of the word: Amos viii. 11, 12, I will
   send a famine of hearing the word of the Lord, and they shall wander
   from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to
   and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find it.' Usually
   that is the way that God taketh for a glutted people, that scorn and
   neglect the word, when they might gather it in like manna from heaven
   every day; that they may ride many miles before they hear a savoury
   sermon; and then those that were not for the word, or desirous to be
   rid of it, may long for a little comfort and reviving by it, and cannot
   enjoy it.

   2. Men bewray this satiety and fulness of the word by fond affectation
   of luscious strains; wholesome doctrines will not down with them,
   unless it be cooked and sauced to their wanton appetites. O Christians!
   the spiritual appetite desires to logikon adolon gala, the sincere milk
   of the word,' 1 Peter ii. 2--unmixed milk; give them plain, simple
   milk, without human mixtures and compositions. The relish of the word
   is spoiled by the garish strains of a frothy eloquence. A plain solid
   truth is more suitable to a gracious heart. A man that hath a natural
   instinct to the word delights in the simplicity of it. An infant hath a
   distinguishing palate, and knows the mother's milk, and pukes and casts
   when it sucks another. So certainly, if we had true spiritual life, we
   would be delighted in the word for the word's sake, the more plain it
   is, provided it be sound. I am not for a loose, careless delivering of
   God's message; but it is the sound, plain, and wholesome ministry which
   suits with a gracious appetite. It argues a distempered heart when we
   must have quails and dainties, and loathe manna. Consider; in heaven,
   where we have the most simple apprehension of things, we have the
   highest affection to them; no need of rhetoric in heaven. And certainly
   the more heavenly we are, the more perfect in grace, the more wisdom
   shall we see in plain scriptural truth, infinitely exceeding all the
   wisdom of the heathen. Many think the word of God too plain for their
   mouths to preach it; others too stale for their ears to hear it; and
   they must have the fancies of men: Jer. viii. 9, They have rejected my
   word; and what wisdom is in them?' It is strange to see how many will
   disguise religion to please the lusts of men. They mock Christ, as the
   soldiers did, that put a centurion's coat upon him for a robe, and
   then, Hail, King of the Jews.' So they wrap up Christ in the foolish
   garments of their own fancy, and so expose him to mockage rather than
   reverence.

   3. This satiety bewrays itself by our affections to novel opinions, and
   erroneous conceits: 2 Tim. iv. 3, The time will come that they will not
   endure sound doctrine, having itching ears, and shall turn away their
   ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.' Observe it when
   you will, that soul is nigh to spiritual blasting that begins to have a
   loathing of a plain truth; and men must have new things and conceits in
   religion, and so grow weary of opinions, as they do of fashions; and
   then by God's just judgment they run from one fancy to another, till
   they quite run themselves out of breath, and have shaken off all
   religion and good conscience. Therefore take heed of being given up to
   this vertiginous spirit, to be turned and 4 tossed up and down with
   every wind of doctrine,' Eph. iv. 14. Peripheromenoi, the apostle's
   word, signifies to be carried round in a circle; he alludes to a
   mariner's compass, [8] that is carried by every wind; this wind takes
   them, and then another; such light chaff are men when they begin to
   loathe the plain truths of God. But it is an argument of a gracious
   heart when we can receive old truth with new affections, and look for
   the power of God and new quickenings.

   4. This levity and instability of spirit is because they look for all
   the virtue of religion from their notions and their opinions, and not
   from Christ; then they think this change of opinion shall make them,
   better; their hearts shall be changed. They try experiments so long,
   till the Lord hath given them up to a spirit of infatuation, and then
   all comes to nothing, but they as a brand are fit for the burning.

   5. By our worldly projects. Men show a loathing of this word by their
   eagerness to the world; their hearts, with Martha, are cumbered with
   many things, while Mary sat at the feet of Jesus to hear his word, Luke
   x. We are very fervorous in worldly affairs; there we can experiment
   this kind of affection which David speaks of to the word. Beware of
   this coldness to the word; it is an ill symptom both to nations and
   persons.

   Use 2. To press us to get this fervent and constant affection to the
   word. To this end consider--

   1. Whose word it is. God's word; and your best affections are due to
   him: Isa. xxvi. 8, Our desires are to thee, and to the remembrance of
   thy name;' there you shall hear of God, there God hath displayed his
   name. Our desires are to thee; not only so, but to thy memorial,' to
   the remembrance of thy name;' that is, to his word, which is as the
   bellows to blow up the sparks, and to quicken our affections to him.

   2. See what benefits we have by the word of God; how beneficial it is
   to enlighten and direct us, quicken and comfort us, supply and
   strengthen us.

   [1.] To enlighten and direct us. Light is pleasant,' saith Solomon;' it
   is a good thing to behold the sun with our eyes,' Eccles. xi. 7. If
   light natural be pleasant, what is light spiritual? Therefore the
   Psalmist compares the word to the sun. The visible world can no more be
   without the one than the intellectual world can be without the other;
   and the one doth as much rejoice the heart as the other: Ps. xix. 8,
   The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; the judgments
   of the Lord are pure, enlightening the eyes.' Oh! it is a comfort to
   have light to see our way. When men begin to have a conscience about
   heavenly things, oh! then they judge so indeed. To others we speak in
   vain when we tell them what light they shall have by the word. They say
   those that live under the arctic pole, at the autumnal equinoctial the
   sun setteth to them, and doth not rise again till the vernal, and so
   are six whole months under a perpetual night, as if they were buried in
   a grave; but at the time of its return, with what clapping of hands and
   expressions of joy do they welcome the sun again into their parts! So
   when the word of God is made known to us, how should we welcome it! The
   city of Geneva gave this for a motto, Post tenebras lux--after
   darkness, light; implying that the return of the gospel was as light
   after a long darkness; as the coming of the sun again to those northern
   people. While Paul and his company were in that great storm at sea,
   when they saw neither sun nor stars for many days, and were afraid they
   should fall upon rocks and dangerous shelves, oh! with what longing did
   they expect to see day again! Acts xxvii. So a poor bewildered soul
   that had lost its way, or when a child of God doth see but by half a
   light, how desirable is sure direction! Now this cannot be had but from
   the word of God, To the law and to the testimony.'

   [2.] To comfort us in all straits. In the word of God there is a salve
   for every sore, and a promise for every condition. God hath plentifully
   opened his good-will to sinners. Therefore the children of God, when
   they labour under the guilt of sin, there they can hear of God's
   promises of pardon: Isa. lv. 7, Let the wicked forsake his way, and the
   unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord, and he
   will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly
   pardon.' Against apostasy they have that promise: Jer. xxxii. 40, I
   will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.'
   When they are under weak performances, the word will tell them, The
   Lord will spare you, and pity you as a man spares his only son,' Mal.
   iii. 17; and when they lie under troubles, inconveniences, and deep
   crosses, there is a promise--the Lord will be with them in affliction;
   the word will show them Christ in the affliction, and heaven beyond the
   affliction; and then they are comforted, 1 Cor. x. 13. When they are
   troubled about worldly provisions, providing for themselves and
   families, it saith, Be contented, I will never leave thee nor forsake
   thee,' Heb. xiii. 5. When their children come to their minds and
   thoughts, what will become of them when we are dead and gone, the word
   will tell you of promises made to you and your children, and of God's
   taking care of them. In short, God is a sun and shield, and no good
   thing will he withhold,' &c. Ps. lxxxiv. 11. There is all manner of
   blessings adopted and taken into covenant. Look round about the
   covenant, look into the word of God; there is nothing wanting for the
   comfort of believers; in every condition there is a promise to support
   and bear them up. Now, because of this comfort they have in the word of
   God, therefore it quickens their desires.

   [3.] To supply and strengthen us. It is our food. Alas! what a poor
   languishing Christian will a man be that doth not often make use of the
   word! This strengthens him against corruptions, quickens him in duties,
   and gives success in conflicts. The sword of the Spirit is the choicest
   weapon. It is the power of God to salvation.' Rom. i. 16; and the word
   of his grace, which is able to build us up,' Acts xx. 32. If our heart
   be dead in prayer, here is the rod of Moses to strike upon the rock to
   make the waters gush out. Therefore, since we have such benefit by the
   word, we should long and desire to get such a strong affection.

   3. Consider what benefit you will have by these desires after the word.
   It will keep up our diligence, and will make us exercise ourselves
   therein. Desire doth all that is done in the world; digging for
   knowledge is tedious, but the end sweetens it. They that have an
   affection to the word shall never be destitute of success therein;' God
   will fulfil the desire of the saints.' He that satisfieth the gaping of
   the young raven will these desires A strong affection to the word is
   the argument that moves God: Ps. cxlv. 19, He will fulfil the desire of
   them that fear him; he also will hear their cry, and will save them.'
   And if this desire be painful, yet it is salutary and healthful to the
   soul. In this sickness there is health; in this weakness there is
   strength; in this thirst, comfort; and in this hunger, satisfaction.

   For means--

   [1.] Get a high esteem of spiritual enjoyments. Valuation and esteem
   precede desire. Wicked men, that value themselves by carnal comforts,
   their souls run out with vehement longing that way. A child of God,
   that values himself by spiritual enjoyments, by know ledge, grace,
   subjection to God, that counts these his greatest benefits, his main
   desire is to be acquainted with the word of God. The word hath a
   subserviency to his end. Poor low-spirited creatures, that value
   themselves by the plenty of external accommodations, they will never
   feel this longing after the word. Prov. viii. 10, Receive instruction
   rather than silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold.'

   [2.] Let a man live in the awe of God, and make it his business to
   maintain communion with him, and then he will be longing after him.
   This will show the necessity of the word of God for his comfort and
   strength upon all occasions. A lively Christian, that is put to it in
   good earnest, he must have the word by him to direct, comfort, and
   strengthen him; as he that labours hard must have his meals, or else he
   will faint and be overcome by his labour. We content ourselves with a
   loose profession, and so do not see the need of food, have not this
   hungering longing desire after the bread of life. Painted fire needs no
   fuel; a dead formal profession is easily kept up; but a man that makes
   it his business to maintain communion with him, and much exercised to
   godliness, is hungering and thirsting that he might meet with God.

SERMON XXII.

   Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from thy
   commandments.--Ver. 21.

   IN the 18th verse, the prophet had begged divine illumination, that his
   eyes might be opened to see more into the nature of the word. He
   backeth that petition with three arguments. The first is taken from his
   condition in the world, I am a stranger upon earth.' The second
   argument is taken from the vehemency of his affection to the word, My
   soul breaketh,' &c. A man that is regenerate, as David was, he hath not
   only some faint and languid motions towards holy things, but a great
   and strong affection of heart, My heart even breaketh for the longing,'
   &c. In this verse here is the third reason, Open mine eyes.' Why?
   Because erring from the commandment is dangerous, and bringeth us under
   God's curse, which will be executed by the rebukes of his providence.
   There have been ever some that op posed God, but yet they have ever
   been blasted by God; he hath always vindicated the contempt of his law
   by the severe executions of his justice upon the contemners of it, Thou
   hast rebuked the proud.' We should not let pass God's judgments without
   profit; but the more the law is owned from heaven, the more entirely
   should we apply ourselves to the obedience of it. Therefore this is one
   reason why David begs for light, direction, and strength, for thou hast
   rebuked the proud,' &c.; therefore, Lord, teach me, that I may not come
   under the rebukes of thine anger.

   Some read the words in two distinct sentences, Thou hast rebuked the
   proud;' and then, Cursed are they which do err from thy commandments.'
   But it comes all to one with our reading; therefore I shall not stand
   to insist upon examining the ground of this difference.

   In the words observe--

   1. The term that is given to wicked men, the proud, so commonly called
   in scripture: Mal. iii. 15, They call the proud happy; yea, they that
   work wickedness are set up.'

   2. The instance and discovery of their pride, they err from thy
   commandments.

   3. The evil state in which they are, they are cursed. Though the wicked
   are not presently punished, yet they are all cursed, and in time they
   shall be punished.

   4. The begun execution of this curse, thou hast rebuked them, that is,
   punished or destroyed: Ps. vi. 1, Rebuke me not in thine anger, neither
   chasten me in thy hot displeasure.'

   The points are--

   1. That the worst sort of proud creatures are those that do err from
   God's commandments; for so is the description here, The proud have
   erred,' &c.

   2. These proud ones, they are cursed. Those that continue in obstinacy
   and impenitency in their sins and errors, they are under a curse.

   3. They are not only cursed, but are also rebuked; that is, not only
   threatened, but this curse shall be surely executed. In this world it
   is begun many times, and in part executed, but in the next fully and
   sorely.

   Doct. 1. That the worst sort of proud creatures are those that err from
   God's commandments.

   Here we must distinguish of erring, then of pride.

   First, Of erring from God's commandments. There is an erring out of
   frailty, and an erring out of obstinacy.

   1. An erring out of frailty; and so David saith, Ps. cxix. 176, I have
   gone astray like a lost sheep;' and again, Ps. xix. 12, Who can
   understand his errors?' This is not meant here of every failing and
   slip, every sin of ignorance and incogitancy; no, nor every act of
   rebellion and perverseness of affection which may be found in the
   children of God. Though there be a pride in all sins against knowledge
   and light, that kind of sinning is interpretatively a confronting of
   God, a despising of his commandments; as David is said to do, 2 Sam.
   xii. 9, pro hic et nunc, for the time; the will of the creature is set
   up against the creator; yet this is not the erring here spoken of.

   2. There is an erring out of obstinacy, impenitency, and habitual
   contempt of the lawgiver. This is spoken of, Ps. xcv. 10, It is a
   people that do err in their hearts.' To err in mind is bad, to err out
   of ignorance; but it is a people that stubbornly refuse to walk in the
   ways God hath enjoined them. Some err out of simple nescience,
   ignorance, or mistake, or else through the cloud with which some
   present temptation overcasts the mind. These err in their minds, but
   others err in their hearts, that care not for, or do not desire to hear
   of, their duty to God. A man that erreth out of ignorance can say,
   Lord, I know not;' but those that err in their heart, they say, We
   desire not the knowledge of thy ways,' Job xxi. 14; they do not only
   fall into sin, but love to continue in it. The apostle speaks of
   ungodly deeds un godly committed,' Jude 15. The matter of sin is not so
   much to be regarded as the manner, with what heart it is done, ungodly
   committed, with contempt of God. Now, such contemners of God and his
   law are here described, as all obstinate and impenitent sinners are.

   Secondly, We must distinguish of pride, which is either moral or
   spiritual.

   1. Moral pride is an over-high conceit of ourselves, or our own
   excellencies, discovered by our disdain and contempt of others. So it
   is said of Nebuchadnezzar, his heart was lifted up.' This is that pride
   that is spoken of 1 Peter v. 5, God resisteth the proud.' There should
   be a mutual condescension between men; for God resisteth the proud,
   that is, those that are lifted up above others.

   2. Spiritual pride, that is, disobedience and impenitency, which is
   discovered by a neglect of God and contempt of his law; and that pride
   is often so taken appeareth by these scriptures: Mal. iv. 1, The day of
   the Lord shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do
   wickedly, shall be stubble.' Mark, they that do wickedly, and the
   proud, are made synonymous expressions. So Neh. ix. 16, But they and
   our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not
   to thy commandments.' Their obstinacy in sin, or unsubjection to God,
   is made to be pride. So Jeremiah, when he gives the people good counsel
   to prevent ensuing judgments, Hear ye, give ear, be not proud,' Jer.
   xiii. 15; that is, do not obstinately refuse to comply with God's will.
   And afterward, ver. 17, My soul shall weep sore for your pride.' So
   that unhumbled sinners are guilty of this spiritual pride, of contempt
   of God himself.

   Having opened these things, that by erring is meant not out of frailty,
   but by obstinacy; that by pride is not meant that moral pride by which
   we contemn others, but that spiritual pride, when our hearts are
   unhumbled and unsubdued to God, my work is now to prove--

   1. That obstinacy and impenitency is pride.

   2. That it is the worst sort of pride.

   First, That there is pride in impenitency and obstinacy in a course of
   sin. Why?

   1. Because they neglect God. To slight a superior, and not to give him
   due respect, hath ever been accounted pride. Surely then this is pride
   with a witness, to neglect God, who is over all, blessed for ever:' Ps.
   x. 4, The wicked through the pride of his countenance will not seek
   after God;' that is, of his heart, bewrayed by his countenance, he will
   not seek after God, and God is not in all his thoughts;' that is,
   scarce troubled with such a thought of what will please or displease
   God; he doth not think it necessary or worth the time to look after.

   2. They oppose God, and set themselves as parties against him: James
   iv. 6, God resisteth the proud;' God standeth in a posture of war
   against the proud. The word implies that every proud man is in battle
   array or posture of war against God: so every impenitent person sets
   himself against God. The quarrel between God and him is, who shall
   stoop, whose will shall stand? whether God shall serve or they? Isa,
   xliii. 24, You have made me to serve with your sins, and wearied me
   with your iniquities.' Indeed, they do not only oppose him, but they
   would depose him, or put him out of the throne, while they would
   subject God's will to their own. He that would be at his own dispose,
   and do what pleaseth him, is a god to himself.

   3. In all this opposition they slight God, and despise--(1.) His
   authority in making the law; (2.) His power and greatness in making
   good the sanction of the law.

   [1.] They despise the authority of God in the law itself. When men will
   set up their own will in a contradiction to God, it is a mighty
   dishonour to God: 2 Sam. xii. 9, Wherefore hast thou despised the
   commandment of the Lord?' Every sin that is committed slights the law
   that forbids it, as if it were not to be stood upon; it is no matter
   what God saith to the contrary. There is fearing the commandment, and
   despising the commandment. Fearing the commandment, that is the effect
   of a wise heart: Prov. xiii. 13, He that feareth the commandment shall
   be rewarded.' If God interpose, it is more than if there were an angel
   in the way with a flaming sword. There is a commandment in the way; he
   fears it, his way is hedged up, he dares not go on. But now
   impenitency, that slights the commandment. A sinner dares do that which
   an angel durst not do. It is said of Michael the archangel, Jude 9,
   that he durst not bring a railing accusation;' he had not the boldness.
   Thus they despise the authority of God in the law.

   [2.] They despise the power of God in the sanction of the law, when
   they will run the hazard of those sad threatenings, as if they were a
   vain scarecrow, as if they could make good their cause against God: 1
   Cor. x. 22, Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than
   he?' Sinning is an entering the lists with God, as if they could carry
   their cause against him; and therefore one great cure of hardness of
   heart and impenitency is seriously to meditate upon God's power: Deut.
   x. 16, 17, Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no
   more stiff-necked.' Why? For the Lord your God is a God of gods and
   Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty and terrible.' Do you know what
   God is? and will you contend with him? Certainly you will fail in the
   enterprise and undertaking.

   Secondly, Let me prove there are none so proud as they that can brave
   it thus with God. I will take the rise of my argument thus--

   1. Of all pride, that against superiors is most heinous.

   2. Of all superiors, God is the highest, and deserveth our chiefest
   respect.

   1. Of all pride, that against superiors is most heinous. Pride
   bewrayeth itself either by a disdain of inferiors, neglect of equals,
   or contempt of superiors. Now, of all the others, this is the most
   offensive, because there is more to check it; therefore it is
   threatened as a great disorder, Isa. iii. 4, 5, that the base should
   rise against the honourable, and the child should behave himself
   proudly against the ancient.' When men carry themselves insolently to
   those that are far their betters, that is counted a great arrogancy in
   the world: to injure equals or contemn inferiors is not so much. There
   is the ground of the argument.

   2. Of all superiors, God is the highest, and deserves our chiefest
   respect; therefore to deal proudly against him is worst of all.
   Consider--

   [1.] That God hath an absolute jurisdiction.

   [2.] His supremacy is not precarious.

   [3.] In the management of his supremacy he useth much condescension.
   Now, to stand out against him, oh, what egregious pride is this!

   [1.] He hath an absolute jurisdiction over us. Those that are our
   betters, we are to honour and respect them, though they have not power
   over us; but God is not only honourable, but chief and supreme, and
   hath a full right in us. In the civil law they distinguish of a twofold
   dominion; there is dominium jurisdictionis and dominium
   proprietatis--the dominion of jurisdiction and of propriety. The do
   minion of jurisdiction is proper to reasonable creatures, who only are
   capable of government. Propriety, that respects other things, as our
   goods and lands; and propriety argues a greater right and a greater
   dominion. A man may have a jurisdiction over others when he hath not an
   absolute dispose over them, as a prince over his subjects. Nay, a man
   that hath a jurisdiction and propriety too, his propriety is greater
   over his lands and estate than over his servants, though they be
   slaves; yet, because they partake of the same nature with himself, he
   hath not such a power to dispose of them as he hath to dispose of his
   goods and lands. Now God hath not only an. absolute jurisdiction over
   us, which were enough in the case, but he hath a propriety, a more
   absolute power over every man than the greatest monarch hath--what
   shall I say--over his subjects, over his slaves? nay, a greater
   propriety than he hath over his goods and lands. Why? For he made us
   out of nothing; he is our potter, we his clay: he hath such a power
   over us, to dispose of us according to his will, as a potter over his
   clay to form what vessel he pleaseth. Now for a man to strive with his
   maker, it is as if the clay should lift up itself against the potter.
   So much the prophet saith, Isa. xlv. 9, Woe unto him that striveth with
   his maker.' What! shall the pot lift up itself against the potter? That
   were monstrous, since it is his. Now the potter did not make the
   matter, only bestows form and art upon it, but God gives us form,
   matter, and all, and shall we rise up against him, and contemn him?

   [2.] Consider that his supremacy is not precarious; it doth not stand
   to the courtesy of man, that is, whether man will yield God to be
   supreme, yea or nay; but it is backed with a mighty power: 1 Peter v.
   6, Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God.' God's hand is a
   mighty hand, and therefore we should humble ourselves. It is a madness
   to contend with the Lord of hosts. What are we to the Lord, who can
   stop our breath in a moment? Job iv. 9, By the blast of God they
   perish, and by the breath of his nostrils they are consumed.' With a
   breath God can destroy us all, and resolve us into nothing; therefore,
   to rise up against God, this is the greater pride. Other superiors
   cannot always maintain their right; they may be foiled in the
   contention; but surely God will have the best of it; it is madness to
   contest with him.

   [3.] God hath not only right, and that backed with an almighty power,
   but in the management of his supremacy over men he useth much
   condescension. To instance that in two things.

   (1.) In making motions of peace to such proud and obstinate creatures
   as we are, that can be of no use or profit to him; ay! and though he be
   the wronged party. There is in us that which Austin calls infirmitas
   animositatis--the weakness of strength of stomach. We are striving who
   shall yield first. Though it be for our interest and advantage to be
   reconciled, yet we are looking who shall submit first; but the Lord,
   though he can back his sovereignty with power, yet he comes down from
   the throne of sovereignty, and makes offers of grace, and prays you to
   be reconciled. When he might destroy, then he beseecheth, and speaketh
   supplications to the creature; he comes and entreats you with a great
   deal of affectionate earnestness. Oh! that God should stoop thus to a
   handful of unprofitable dust--creatures that can no way be of use and
   profit to him! What pride is this, to stand it out against such a God!

   (2.) In seeking to reclaim us, and soften us by many mercies, and by
   his kind dealing with us. God would break the heart rather than the
   back of the sinner, and therefore he seeks to melt us with acts of
   kindness. Now for us to continue our pride and rebellion after all
   this, what a pride is this--of how horrible a nature? Rom. ii. 4,
   Despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance, not
   considering that the goodness of God should lead us to repentance?' God
   withholds his hand, and is loath to strike; nay, not only so, but doth
   follow us with acts of grace and kindness, and maintain us with his own
   expenses, and yet the proud heart of man will not relent. Mark that
   word, they despise his goodness;' they do in effect say, God shall not
   have my heart for all this. Oh, how great is this pride! These are
   considerations that may give us a little light to judge of that pride
   that is in obstinacy and impenitency in sin. If you consider God's
   absolute right, he hath not only a dominion of jurisdiction over us,
   but a full propriety in us, to use us at his pleasure; and this right
   of his is backed with almighty power, and doth not stand with the
   creature's courtesy; and though it be so, yet it is managed with a
   great deal of condescension and love; he beseecheth poor creatures, and
   tendereth offers of peace, and they are fed and maintained at his
   charge, and taste of his goodness and bounty.

   Use 1. It informs us, how humble soever men appear otherwise, yet they
   are proud if they have never submitted to God with brokenness of heart,
   seeking his pardon and favour. There are many which are facile to men,
   and yet full of contumacy and stoutness of stomach against God; they
   can stoop to the poorest worm, and court their favour, but yet deal
   insolently with their maker. But if men were persuaded of the truth of
   God's being, they would sooner be convinced of the naughtiness of their
   hearts, by comparing their carriage to God and men. Many there are that
   are tender of wounding the reputation of men, yet dishonour God and are
   never troubled. Many that look upon it as an uncomely thing to despise
   their neighbour, to deal hotly with an underling, and vaunt it, yet
   never made conscience of submitting themselves to God, who is their
   undoubted superior. Men count it part of humility and good manners to
   yield to those that are over them, and to pay them all kind of respect
   and subjection; yet they never care to seek the favour of God, and
   humble themselves seriously for their offences against him. You take it
   ill in the world when the people of mean quality insult over you, when
   such times fall out as the base rise up against the honourable. What
   are you to God? Poor base worms! will you contend with your maker? Do
   you count it to be heavy disorder, and a strange inversion of all
   states and conditions, that men of mean and low fortunes should brave
   it over you, and sway things in the world? and how ill may God take it
   that you stout it out against him? There is a greater distance between
   him and you, than between you and your fellow-creatures; therefore, if
   it be grievous to you, what a heinous offence is it to stand out
   against God?

   Use 2. It instructs us what is the way to reduce and bring home sinners
   to God, by breaking their pride, or, as the expression is, Job xxxiii.
   17, by hiding pride from man;' by which is meant taking away pride; for
   that which is taken away is hidden or cannot be seen. As the hiding of
   sin is the taking away sin, so the hiding of pride is the cure of it.

   1. By humble and broken-hearted addresses to God for his pardon and his
   grace. There is no way to cure the pride of unregeneracy but by
   brokenness of heart. Come and put your mouths in the dust, and
   acknowledge that you have too long stood it out against God. As the
   nobles of the king of Assyria came with ropes about their necks, and
   submitted themselves; so, Jer. xxxi. 9, They shall return with weeping
   and supplications.' This is the way to come out of your sins, to go and
   bemoan the stubbornness and pride of your hearts; as Ephraim be moaned
   himself, and smote upon his thigh, and complained of his obstinacy,
   Jer. xxxi. 18. Christians, first or last God will bring you to this; if
   you do not stoop voluntarily, you shall by force; if your hearts be not
   broken by the power of his grace, they shall be broken in pieces by the
   power of his providence: Rom. xiv. 11, As I live, saith the Lord, every
   knee shall bow to me.' God hath sworn, As I live;' now in every oath
   there is an implicit imprecation, that is, if this be not done, then
   let this befall me. So there is an implicit imprecation in that oath,
   Count me not a living God if I do not make the creature stoop. If you
   stand it out against the power of his word, can you stand it out
   against the power of Christ when he comes in glory? Ezek. xxii. 14, Can
   thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong in the days that I
   shall deal with thee?' Oh, how will your faces gather blackness and
   darkness in that day!

   2. Yield up yourselves to be governed by his will and pleasure. It is
   not enough to come weary and heavy laden, not only to be sensible of
   the burden of sin, and beg for pardon, but we must take Christ's yoke,
   Mat. xi. 29. Nature sticks at this: a proud heart is loath to come
   under the yoke. We would taste of the sweetness of mercy, but cannot
   endure the bonds and restraint of duty; as Ephraim would tread out the
   corn, but was loath to break the clods, Hosea x. 11. The prophet
   alludes to the manner among the Jews; their fashion was to tread or
   thresh out their corn by the feet of beasts, and the ox his mouth was
   not to be muzzled; it was easy work, and afforded abundance of food,
   Deut. xxv. 4. We would have comfort, but not duty.

   3. We must constantly cherish a humble frame of spirit, if we would
   maintain communion with God, Micah vi. 8; not only walk with God, but
   humble thyself to walk with God. Why? He is a great sovereign, and he
   will be exactly observed and constantly depended upon; and if you slip,
   you must bewail your failings, and from first to last all must be
   ascribed to grace.

   Doct. 2. These proud are cursed, or, those that obstinately and
   impenitently continue in their sins, they are under a curse.

   1. I shall open the nature of this curse.

   2. Show how impenitent sinners come under this curse.

   First, The nature and quality of this curse; or what is that curse
   which lies upon all wicked men? That will best be understood by
   considering that scripture wherein the tenor of the law is described:
   Deut. xxxvii. 26, Cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of
   this law to do them;' and Gal. iii. 10, Cursed is every one which
   continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law
   to do them.' Where there is considerable, the duty which the law
   exacteth, and then the penalty which the law inflicteth.

   1. The duty which the law exacteth; every one must continue in the
   words of this law to do it. An innocent holy nature, that is
   presupposed, for it is said the person must continue. It doth not
   consider man as lapsed or fallen, or as having already broken with God.
   And then he must continue in all things; there is a universal, a
   perfect obedience, that is indispensably required, while we are in our
   natural condition. And then the perpetuity; he must hold out to the
   last; if he fail in one point he is gone. All this is indispensably
   exacted of all them that live under the tenor of this covenant: He that
   doth them shall live in them;' and the soul that sinneth shall die.'
   There is required perpetual, perfect, personal obedience. What will you
   do if this covenant lie upon you, as it doth upon all men in their
   natural condition? If God call you to a punctual account of the most
   inoffensive day that ever you past over, what will become of you? If
   thou, O Lord, shalt mark iniquity, O Lord, who shall stand?' Ps. cxxx.
   3. Better never have been born than be liable to that judgment. Oh!
   therefore, when the law shall take a sinner by the throat, and say, Pay
   me that which thou owest,' what shall a poor sinner do? This is the
   duty exacted.

   2. The penalty that shall be inflicted, Cursed is everyone that
   continueth not in the words of this law to do it.' The law hath a mouth
   that speaketh terrible things. Cursed, it is but one word, but it may
   be spread abroad into very large considerations. In one place it is
   said. The Lord will not spare him. All the curses that are written in
   this book of this law shall light upon him,' Deut. xxix. 20. The book
   of the law is full of curses, and all together they show you what is
   the portion of an impenitent sinner. In another place it is said Every
   curse and every plague which is not written in the book of this law
   will the Lord bring upon thee,' Deut. xxviii. 61. Mark, though it be
   not specified in the law. God hath threatened sundry sorts of
   punishments, yet he hath many plagues in store which are not committed
   to record or writing; therefore, whatever is written or unwritten,
   revealed in the word or dispensed in providence by way of plague and
   misery, it is but the interpretation of this one word, Cursed is he
   that continueth not,' &c. However, because particulars are most
   affective, I will name some parts of the curse.

   [1.] This is one part of the cursed condition of a sinner that is under
   the law, that the knowledge of his duty doth but the more irritate
   corruption: Rom. vii. 9, The commandment came, and sin revived.' The
   more we understand of the necessity of our subjection to God, the more
   is the soul opposite to God. Sin takes occasion by the commandment, as
   oppositions do more exasperate and enrage a waspish, spirit.

   [2.] This exaction of duty doth either terrify or stupify the
   conscience; he that escapeth the one suffereth the other. Either men
   are terrified: indeed all sinners are liable to it; the conscience of a
   sinner is a sore place, and the apostle saith they are liable to
   bondage all their days,' Heb. ii. 14; as Belshazzar trembled to see the
   hand writing upon the wall, and Felix trembled to hear of judgment to
   come; so a carnal man is afraid to think of his condition, and some are
   actually under horror, and wherever they go, as the devils do, they
   carry their own hell about them. Or if conscience be not terrified,
   then it is stupified; they grow senseless of their misery, and are past
   feeling,' Eph. iv. 19; and that is a very sad estate, and dangerous
   temper of soul, when men have outgrown all feelings of conscience, and
   worn out the prints of conviction. These are the two extremes that all
   Christless persons are incident unto.

   [3.] There is a curse upon all that a man hath, as long as he continues
   in his rebellion and obstinacy against God; he is cursed in his basket
   and store, in his going out, and coming in,' &c., Deut. xxviii. 15-17.
   A man is cursed in his table; that becomes a snare; his afflictions are
   but beginnings of sorrows. It is a miserable thing to lie in such an
   estate. If the curse do not break out so visibly or sensibly, it is
   because now it is the day of God's patience, and he waits for our
   return. But mark, God's spiritual providence is the more dreadful. When
   God rains snares' upon men, all the seeming comforts which they have do
   but harden them in an evil course, and hold them the faster in the
   bonds of iniquity.

   [4.] There is a curse upon all he doth; his duties are lost, his
   prayers are turned into sin,' his hearing is the savour of death unto
   death,' whilst he remaineth in his impenitency. It is said: Prov. xxi.
   27, The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination; how much more when he
   bringeth it with a wicked mind?' Though he should come in the best
   manner he can with his flocks and herds, yet all will be to no purpose,
   it is an abomination to God.

   [5.] Impenitency binds over a man, body and soul, to everlasting
   torment. In time it will come to that, Go ye cursed,' &c., Mat. xxv.
   41. They are only continued until they have filled up their measure,
   and are ripened for hell, and then they lie eternally under the wrath
   of God. Look, as it is sweet to hear, Come ye blessed,' &c., so
   dreadful in that day to hear, Go ye cursed,' &c. Thus are the proud
   cursed, that is, obstinate, impenitent sinners, while they stand off
   from God. Secondly, Let me examine upon what score they are cursed.

   1. Every man by nature is under the curse; for until they are in Christ
   they are under Adam's covenant, and Adam's covenant will yield no
   blessing to the fallen creature: Gal. in. 10, As many as are under the
   works of the law are under the curse,' &c. Mark, every man that remains
   under the law, that hath not gotten an interest in Christ, the curse of
   the first covenant remains upon him, and accordingly at the last day he
   shall have judgment without mercy; he shall be judged according to the
   terms of that covenant: for there are but two states, under the law, or
   under grace; therefore, while they are in a state of nature, they must
   needs be under wrath. So John iii. 18, He that believeth not is
   condemned already;' that is, in the sentence of the law; there is a
   curse gone out against him; the man is gone, lost, condemned already.

   2. This curse abideth upon us until we believe in Christ. The sentence
   of the law is not repealed: John iii. 36, He that believeth not, the
   wrath of God abideth on him;' Gal. iii. 13, Christ hath redeemed us
   from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us,' &c.

   3. When Christ is tendered, and finally refused, then the sentence of
   the law is ratified in the gospel or the court of mercy. A court of
   chancery God hath set up in the gospel for penitent sinners. But then
   it follows, This is the condemnation, that light is come into the
   world, and men choose darkness,' &c. When God shall tender men better
   conditions by Christ, and they turn their backs upon it, then is this
   curse confirmed.

   Use 1. Consider how matters stand between God and us; examine how it is
   with you. Here let me lay down these propositions by way of trial:--

   1. Every man by nature is in a cursed condition, Eph. ii. 3; every man
   is liable to Adam's forfeiture and breach; the elect children of God as
   well as others are liable to the curse.

   2. There is no way to escape this curse but by flying to Christ for
   refuge, Heb. vi. 18. As a man would flee from the avenger of blood, so
   should we flee from the curse of the law that is at our heels. Wrath is
   abroad seeking out sinners; now, saith the apostle, Oh, that I might be
   found in him!'

   3. A sense of this benefit we have by Christ will necessarily beget an
   unfeigned love to him; else we can have no evidence, but the curse doth
   still remain: and therefore it is said, 1 Cor. xvi. 22, If any man love
   not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be anathema maranatha,' accursed
   till the Lord come, that is, for ever and ever. How can a man think he
   shall be the better for Christ that doth not love Christ, nor delight
   in him, and have no value for him? And therefore, if you have not this
   love to Christ, it is a sign you have no benefit by him, you have not
   that faith that will give you a title.

   4. This love must be expressed by a sincere obedience; for this is
   love, to keep his commandments,' 1 John v. 3; and Gal. v. 24, They that
   are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the lusts thereof.' They are
   not Christ's, are not to be reckoned to him, that merely make a
   profession of his name, and with whom his memory seems to be precious;
   but they are Christ's that testify love to Christ. Do you perform
   duties for Christ's sake?

   Use 2. To press you to come out of the curse which cleaves to all
   impenitent sinners. Oh, what a dreadful condition are they in! And how
   soon God may take advantage of this curse, and cut us off from a
   possibility of grace, we cannot tell; and at the last day this curse
   will be ratified. Therefore be sensible of the burden; come out of it.
   This is God's end in shutting up a sinner under such a fatal necessity;
   either you must perish for ever or run to Christ. This should quicken
   us the more to fly to his mercy.

   Thirdly, They are not only cursed, but rebuked, Thou hast rebuked the
   proud,' &c. Observe--

   Doct. 3. The rebukes of God's providence upon impenitent sinners are of
   great use to the saints.

   1. They are arguments of his displeasure against the proud and against
   the impenitent. God, that is so merciful to the humble and
   broken-hearted, that looketh to him that is poor and contrite and
   trembles at the word, Isa. lxvi. 3, he can be severe and just against
   those that deal proudly, that lift up the heel against him, Ps. lxviii.
   21: it is twice repeated, Our God is a God of salvation, but he will
   wound the head of his enemies,' &c. Mark, though mercy be God's
   delight--verily he is a God of salvation--yet we must not imagine a God
   all honey and all sweetness. If men be proud, obstinate, and
   impenitent, they shall be cursed; and not only cursed, but they shall
   be rebuked.

   2. It is a proof and document given to the world how tender God is of
   his word, how willing to satisfy the world. This is the rule we must
   stand by, Thou hast rebuked them.' Why? Because they erred from thy
   commandment.' God hath authorised and ratified the law by the rebukes
   of his providence, and made it authentic and valid in the hearts and
   consciences of men: Rom. i. 18, The wrath of God is revealed from
   heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men,' &c. Mark,
   it is revealed from heaven. The events which fall out in the world we
   should not look upon as casual strokes, or a chance that happened to us
   in the way, but as discoveries from heaven. The word is the rule of
   life. Mark, against all ungodliness; this is the breach of the first
   table; and against all unrighteousness, which is the breach of the
   second table. God hath owned both tables: Heb. ii. 2, The word spoken
   by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience
   received a just recompense of reward.' He means the law, which was
   delivered by the ministry of angels. Now, every transgression, by that
   he means sins of commission; and every disobedience, by that he means
   sins of omission; and God hath met with every breach and every
   violation of the law. How punctually God hath exemplified every
   commandment in his judgment! And if we would make collections of
   providence, we might easily find this, how God hath rebuked pride, and
   that because they err from his commandment.

   Again, it may be improved as a check against envy at the prosperity of
   the wicked. Do not call the proud happy; they are cursed already, and
   in time shall be punished: Mark the end of the wicked,' Ps. xxxvi. 17.
   First or last, God will manifest from heaven his displeasure against
   their impenitency. By daily experience we may see that they thrive ill
   that set themselves against God.

   And then it serves to confirm the truth of the threatening. Oh! when
   God inflicteth judgments, remember the curse of the law is not in vain.
   After the thundering of the threatening, there will break out the bolt
   of confusion and destruction upon the wicked, so that you must either
   do or die for it.

   Use. Let this persuade men to break off their sins by repentance, that
   you may be sensible of the wretchedness of your condition. God's words
   are deeds. Men may curse, and yet God may bless for all that; but God's
   curse is sure to take place. Let us make that use which David doth of
   it, to excite our affections to the word of God by the vengeance which
   God taketh of the pride and scorn of others. The examples of others
   shipwrecking themselves by their rebellion against God are sanctified
   when they make us more careful and watchful that we err not from God's
   commandments.'
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON XXIII.

   Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy
   testimonies.--Ver. 22.

   DAVID was derided for keeping close to God's word, possibly by those
   proud ones mentioned in the former verse. They contemned the word
   themselves, and would not suffer others to keep it; as the Pharisees
   would neither enter into the kingdom of God themselves, nor suffer
   others to enter. But David makes this an argument to beg the Lord's
   grace, to wit, light and strength, that he might give no occasion to
   their reproach; and if it lighted upon him, that it might not rest upon
   him. Or by the proud men may be meant Saul's courtiers, who traduced
   his innocency, and sought to overwhelm him with slander. Now, God knew
   his conscience and integrity, and therefore could best clear him.

   In the words, as in most of the other verses, you have--

   1. A request, remove from me reproach and contempt.

   2. A reason and argument to enforce the request, for I have kept thy
   testimonies.

   First, for the request, Remove from me reproach and contempt.' The word
   signifies, Roll from upon me, let it not come at me, or let it not stay
   with me.

   And then the argument, for I have kept thy testimonies.' The reason may
   be either thus:--(1.) He pleads that he was innocent of what was
   charged upon him, and had not deserved those aspersions. (2.) He
   intimates that it was for his obedience, for this very cause that he
   had kept the word, therefore was reproach rolled upon him. (3.) It may
   be conceived thus, that his respect to God's word was not abated for
   this reproach. He still kept God's testimonies, how wicked soever he
   did appear in the eyes of the world. It is either an assertion of his
   innocency, or he shows the ground why this reproach came upon him; or
   he pleads his respect to God, and his service was not lessened,
   whatever reproach he met with in the performance of it.

   The points from hence are many.

   1. It is no strange thing that they which keep God's testimonies should
   be slandered and reproached.

   2. As it is the usual lot of God's people to be reproached, so it is
   very grievous to them, and heavy to bear.

   3. It being grievous, we may lawfully seek the removal of it. So doth
   David, and so may we, with submission to God's will.

   4. In removal of it, it is best to deal with God about it; for God is
   the great witness of our sincerity, as knowing all things, and so to be
   appealed to in the case. Again, God is the most powerful assertor of
   our innocency; he hath the hearts and tongues of men in his own hands,
   and can either prevent the slanderer from uttering reproach, or the
   hearer from entertainment of the reproach. He that hath such power over
   the consciences of men can clear up our innocency; therefore it is best
   to deal with God about it; and prayer many times proves a better
   vindication than an apology.

   5. In seeking relief with God from this evil, it is a great comfort and
   ground of confidence when we are innocent of what is charged. In some
   cases we must humble ourselves, and then God will take care for our
   credit. We must plead guilty when by our own fault we have given too
   much occasion to the slanders of the wicked: so Ps. cxix. 39, Turn away
   my reproach which I fear, for thy judgments are good.' My reproach, for
   it was in part deserved by himself, and therefore he feared the sad
   consequences of it, and humbles himself before God. But at other times
   we may stand upon our integrity, as David saith here, Turn away my
   reproach and contempt, for I have kept thy testimonies.'

   These are the points which may be drawn from this verse; but I shall
   insist but upon one of them, which, in the prosecution of it, will
   comprise all the rest; and that is this--

   Doct. That reproaches are a usual, but yet a great and grievous,
   affliction to the children of God. I will show--

   1. They are a usual affliction.

   2. They are a grievous affliction.

   First, They are a usual affliction. Reproaches are either such as light
   upon religion itself, or upon our own persons.

   1. Upon religion itself. Sometimes the truth is traduced, and the way
   of God is evil spoken of, disguised with the nicknames of sedition,
   heresy, schism, faction. Look, as astronomers miscall the glorious
   stars by the name of the dog-star, the bear, the dragon's tail, and the
   like--they put upon them names of a horrid sound--so do carnal men
   miscall the glorious things of God, his holy ways; they put an ill name
   upon them: Acts xxiv. 14, After the way which they call heresy, so
   worship I the God of my fathers.' The Jews called Christianity a
   heresy, or an apostasy from the old religion; and so do Papists call
   the Reformation. Luther, when he was charged with apostasy from the
   faith, answered thus: I confess I am an apostate, but from the devil's
   cause; I have not kept touch with the devil. Cant. v. 7, we read that
   the spouse's veil was taken from her by the watchmen; so the comeliness
   of the church is taken away by the imputations of evil men. Thus there
   may reproaches light upon religion itself.

   2. On our persons; and so either for religion's sake, or upon a private
   and personal respect.

   [1.] For religion's sake; and thus God's children have been often
   calumniated. It is foretold by Christ as the lot of his people; and
   therefore he provides against it: Mat. v. 11, Blessed are ye when men
   shall revile you and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil
   against you falsely for my sake.' Those who have no strength and power
   to inflict other injuries have these weapons of malice always in
   readiness. When other kinds of persecutions and violences are
   restrained, yet men take a liberty of censuring and speaking all manner
   of evil falsely of the children of God; and ever this hath been
   verified in the experience of the saints. Their lives are a real
   reproach to the wicked, they do upbraid them; and therefore, to be
   quits with them, the wicked reproach them by censures and
   calumniations. I shall give some instances. Moses had his portion of
   reproaches: Heb xi. 26, Esteeming the reproaches of Christ better
   riches than the treasures of Egypt.' Possibly the Holy Ghost means
   there when he was scoffed at for joining himself with so mean and
   afflicted a people; they thought Moses was mad to quit all his honours.
   Christ himself was accused of the two highest crimes of either
   table--blasphemy and sedition: of blasphemy, which is the highest crime
   against the first table; and of sedition, which is the highest crime
   against the second. And all that will be Christ's they must expect to
   bear his reproach: Heb. xiii. 13, Let us go forth therefore unto him
   without the camp, bearing his reproach.' The apostle alludes to the
   sacrifice of atonement, which was to be slain without the camp. So
   Jesus Christ was cast out of the city; and we must be contented thus to
   be cast off by the world, to be cast forth from among men as vile and
   accursed, bearing Christ's reproach.

   [2.] For personal reproaches; this is very usual with God's children
   also, reproaches upon private and personal occasions. God may let loose
   a railing Shimei against David. Many times he complains of his
   reproaches, often in this psalm, more in other psalms: Ps. xxxi. 13,
   For I have heard the slander of many; they took counsel together
   against me, they devised to take away my life.' Sundry sorts of persons
   made him the butt upon which they let fly the arrows of censure and
   reproach: Ps. xxxv. 15, The abjects gathered themselves together
   against me; they did tear me, and ceased not;' meaning his name was
   torn and rent in pieces, and that by the abjects: such bold and saucy
   dust will be flying in the faces of God's people. So I may speak of
   Jeremiah, and Joseph, and other servants of God; yea, our Lord himself
   endured the contradiction of sinners. Jesus Christ, that was so just
   and innocent, which did so much good in every place, yet meets with
   odious aspersions. So Ps. lxiv. 3, 4, They bend their bows to shoot
   their arrows, even bitter words; that they may shoot in secret at the
   perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.' Perfection meets
   with envy, and envy will vent itself by detraction--a usual affliction
   for the people of God, and therefore we cannot say they are wicked
   because they are traduced, and we should not presently condemn all
   those of whom we hear evil. It was the fashion of the primitive times
   to clothe Christians with bear-skins, and bait them with the dogs.
   God's best children may be clad in an ill livery; and therefore we
   should not easily take up these slanders. Thus it is a usual
   affliction.

   Secondly, It is a grievous affliction. Ver. 39, David saith he looked
   upon it as a great evil. In the account of scripture it is persecution.
   Ishmael is said to persecute Isaac: Gal. iv. 29. How? Because he mocked
   him. Compare it with Gen. xxi. 9: Sarah saw the son of the bondwoman
   mocking Isaac;' and in the reddition and interpretation, the Holy Ghost
   calls it a persecution. So they are called cruel mockings,' Heb. xi.
   36. There is as much cruelty, and as deep a wound made by the tongue of
   reproach many times as by the fist of wickedness. Reproach must needs
   be grievous to God's children, upon a natural and upon a spiritual
   account.

   1. Upon a natural account, because a good name is a great blessing. See
   how it is against nature. It is more grievous than ordinary crosses.
   Many would lose their goods cheerfully, yet they grieve more for the
   loss of their name. Some constitutions are affected more with shame
   than with fear, and above all their possessions they prize their name
   and credit. To most proud spirits, disgraceful punishment is much more
   dreadful than painful: Ps. xxii. 7, All they that see me laugh me to
   scorn; they shoot out the lip, they shake the head.' A good name is
   more precious than life to some: Eccles. vii. 1, A good name is better
   than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's
   birth.' The coupling of these two sentences shows men had rather die
   than lose their name. If a man die, he may leave his name and memory
   behind him that may live still; therefore it is more hateful to have
   our names and credit mangled than be pierced with a sharp sword.

   2. Upon a spiritual account it is a grievous affliction. It is not
   barely for their own sake, because their innocency is taxed; but for
   God's sake, whose glory is concerned in the honour of his servants, and
   whose truth is struck at through their sides. This is grievous to
   grace. Why? Next to a good conscience there is no greater blessing than
   a good name; and certainly he that is prodigal of his credit will not
   be very tender of his conscience; and therefore the children of God,
   upon gracious reasons, stand upon their name, it is the next thing to
   conscience they have to keep. Grace values a good name, partly because
   it is God's gift; it is a blessing adopted and taken into the covenant,
   as well as other blessings. It is one of the promises of God: He will
   hide us as in a pavilion from the strife of tongues,' Ps. xxxi. 20.
   This is frequent in the Old Testament, where heaven is but sparingly
   mentioned; a good name is often mentioned. Partly because it is a
   shadow of eternity. When a man dies, his name lives, which is a pledge
   of our living with God after death; as spices, when broken and
   dissolved, leave an excellent scent, so he leaves his name behind him.
   And partly because it is put above riches: Prov. xxii. 1, A good name
   is rather to be chosen than great riches.' It is better, more pure and
   sublime than wealth, and more worthy our esteem. They are low and
   dreggy spirits whose hearts run after wealth; the greatest spirits run
   out upon fame and honour: so Eccles. vii. 1, A good name is better than
   precious ointment.' Aromatical ointments were things of great use and
   esteem among the Jews, and counted the chief part of their treasures;
   now a good name is better than precious ointment. And partly because of
   the great inconveniences which follow the loss of name. The glory of
   God is much interested in the credit of his servants. The credit of
   religion depends much upon the credit of the persons that profess it.
   When godly men are evil spoken of, the way of truth suffers; and when
   we are polluted, God is polluted: Ezek. xxxvi. 20, They profaned my
   holy name when they said to them, These are the people of the Lord, and
   are gone forth out of his land;' that is, by their scandals. The
   offences are charged upon us, but in effect they prove the disgrace of
   Christ. Christ, that will hereafter be admired of his saints, will now
   be glorified and honoured in them. The shame of those things charged
   upon us redounds to God and religion till we be clear. And as the
   honour of God is concerned in it, so again their safety lies in it.
   Observe it, Satan is first a liar, then a murderer. First, men are
   smitten with the tongue of slander, and afterwards with the fist of
   wickedness: the showers of slander are but presages and beginnings of
   grievous storms of persecution; wicked men take more liberty when the
   children of God are imprisoned as criminals; therefore it is the usual
   practice of Satan first to blast the repute of religious persons, then
   to prosecute them as offenders. Possibly this may be the meaning of
   that, Ps. v. 9, Their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with
   their tongue;' that is, the slanders of the wicked are a preparation to
   death, as an open sepulchre is prepared to swallow and take in the dead
   carcase. I expound it thus, because we find the phrase used in this
   sense. The force and power of the Babylonian, Jer. v. 16, is called an
   open sepulchre;' they are all mighty men; that is, you can expect
   nothing but death from the force and puissance of their assaults. So
   here their reproach is not only a burying-place for our names, but our
   persons; for first men slander, then molest the children of God. When
   the Arian emperor raged against the orthodox Christians, and the
   bishops and pastors of the churches were suppressed everywhere, they
   durst not meddle with Polonus, out of a reverence of the unspottedness
   of his fame; and therefore a good report is a great security and
   protection against violence. And then they desire a good name to honour
   God with it. A blemished instrument is little worth. Who would take
   meat from a leprous hand? It is Satan's policy, when he cannot
   discourage instruments from the work of God, then to blemish and blast
   them. Therefore, those that have anything to do for God in the world
   should be tender of their credit, especially those that are called to
   public office, that they may carry on their work with more success.
   Therefore one of the qualifications of a minister is, He must have a
   good report of them that are without, lest he fall into reproach and
   the snare of the devil,' 1 Tim. iii. 7. I suppose it is taken there
   appellatively, lest he fall into the snare of the slanderer; I will not
   absolutely determine. Men set snares for you, and they watch for your
   halting. Thus grace presseth a good name, because of the consequences
   of it.

   Use 1. Here is advice to persons reproached. Acknowledge God in the
   affliction, though it be great and grievous. God hath an aim in all
   things that befall you. The general aim of all afflictions is to try,
   purge, and make white: Dan. xi. 35; or as it is in Deut. viii. 13, To
   humble thee, prove thee, and do thee good at the latter end.' Your
   enemies may intend harm, but God means good; you should receive good by
   this, as by every affliction. Plutarch, in his excellent discourse, How
   a man should profit by his enemies, brings in a comparison of one
   Jason, that had an impostume, which was let out by the wounds an enemy
   gave him; so many times our impostumes, and the corrupt matter that is
   within us, is let out by the gashes and wounds which those that meant
   harm to us give to our name and credit.

   First, God doth it to humble thee. Carnal men shoot at rovers, but many
   times we find the soul is pricked in the quick; when they shoot their
   arrows of detraction and slanders, it may revive guilt, and put us upon
   serious humiliation before God. There are many sins to which this
   affliction is very proper.

   1. It seems to be a proper cure for the sin of pride; be it pride in
   the mind, which is self-conceit; or pride in the affections, which is
   called vainglory; all sorts of pride; there is no such effectual remedy
   as this. Possibly we have been too self-conceited, then God giveth us
   to such scandals that may show us what we are. Many times our very
   graces do us hurt, as well as our sins; and we may be puffed up with
   what we have received. So for vainglory, when we are apt too much to
   please ourselves in the opinions others have of us, which is an evil
   the people of God are liable to, this pride God will cure by reproach.
   Pride is one of the oldest enemies ever God had; it was born in heaven
   in the breast of the fallen angels, for which they are laid low; and
   when his children harbour it, God hath a quarrel against it. When Paul
   was puffed up, when the bladder was swollen, God sent him a thorn in
   the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet him, lest he should be
   exalted above measure, 2 Cor. xii. 7. Possibly it was some eminent
   affliction; but when he expresseth it afterwards, he mentioneth
   reproaches, ver. 10, Therefore I will rejoice in infirmities,' that is,
   sickness; nay, I will rejoice in reproaches.'

   2. For carnal walking. When we are negligent, and do not take notice of
   the fleshliness and folly we are guilty of and allow in our hearts,
   that breaks out into our actions. God suffers others to reproach us and
   gather up our failings, that we may see what cause we have to take our
   ways to heart. Every man that would live strictly had need of faithful
   friends or watchful enemies; of faithful friends to admonish him, or
   watchful enemies to censure him. God makes use of watchful enemies to
   show us the spots in our garments that are to be washed off. Many times
   a friend is blinded with love, and grows as partial to us as ourselves;
   therefore God sets spies for us to watch for our halting: Jer. xx. 10,
   I heard the defaming of many: report, say they, and we will report it:
   all my familiars watched for my halting.' They lie in wait to take us
   tripping; and God sees it needful that we should have enemies as well
   as friends; how ignorant else should a man be of himself! Therefore God
   useth them as a rod to brush the dust from our clothes.

   3. The sin God would humble us for is censuring. If we have not been so
   tender of the credit of others, God will make us taste the bitterness
   of affliction ourselves, and recompense the like measure into our
   bosoms: Mat. vii. 1, 2, Judge not, that ye be not judged; for with what
   judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete,
   it shall be measured to you again.' We shall find others to judge as
   hardly of us as we do of them. Good thoughts and speeches of others are
   the best preservative of our own name; and therefore, when reproach
   falls upon you, it is not enough you should not slight it, though you
   know the report to be false; but a Christian is to examine himself:
   have we not drawn it upon ourselves by slandering others, or talking
   intemperately of others? and doth not God pay us home in our own coin?
   He that is much given to censuring seldom or never escapes severe
   censuring from others. It is said, Let his own words grieve him.' Your
   own words will fall upon you; therefore humble thyself before God for
   the reproaches thou hast cast upon others. Thus the Lord ordereth it
   with good advice to humble us, and that for pride, careless walking,
   and for censuring others.

   Secondly, It is to try thee.

   1. To try your faith in the great day of accounts. Can you comfort
   yourselves in the solemn vindication of the day of judgment, and in
   God's approbation then? 2 Cor. x. 18, He is approved whom the Lord
   commendeth.' Men cannot defend thee if God condemn thee, they cannot
   condemn thee if God acquit thee; and therefore canst thou stand to
   God's judgment? In a race it is not what the standers-by say, but what
   he that is the judge of the games will determine. We are all in a race,
   and it is not what men say of us, but what God saith, who is judge of
   all: 1 Cor. iv. 3, 4, It is a small thing that I should be judged of
   man's judgment; but he that judgeth me is the Lord.' In the original it
   is man's day,' and so in the margin. We shall never be resolute for
   God, until we come to this, to count it a very small thing to be judged
   of man's judgment. Now is man's day, but God hath his day hereafter. So
   to try our faith in particular promises: Ps. cxix. 42, So shall I have
   wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me; for I trust in thy word.'
   A Christian, when he gives up himself to God, he gives up everything he
   hath to God; not only gives his soul to God to keep, but that God may
   take charge of his person, estate, and good name. Now God requires a
   trust according to the extent of the covenant, a waiting and confidence
   in his power. He can turn the hearts of men, and give them favour in
   their eyes: Ps. xxxvii. 6, He shall bring forth thy righteousness as
   the light, and thy judgment as the noon-day.'

   2. As to try our faith, so our patience. We should prevent reproach as
   much as we can; but then we must bear it when we cannot avoid it. They
   reproach, but I pray, Ps. cix. 4; that was David's exercise and
   revenge; he took that advantage, to pray for them. God will try how we
   can bear the injuries of men. The grace of patience must be tried as
   well as other graces. We read that Shimei went railing upon David to
   the peril of his life; saith David, It may be God hath bid him curse.'
   A mad dog that bites another makes him as mad as himself; so usually
   the injuries and reproaches of others foster up our revenge, and then
   there is no difference between us and them: they sin, and we sin.
   Revenge and injury differ only in order; injury is first, and revenge
   is next. Saith Lactantius, If it be evil in another, for thee to
   imitate him, to be as mad as they, break out in passion and virulency,
   it is more evil in thyself, because thou sinnest twice, against a rule
   and against an example; therefore God tries whether we will be
   passionate or patient. The patience of his servants is mightily
   discovered by reproaches: 1 Cor. iv. 12, Being reviled, we bless; being
   persecuted, we suffer it; being defamed, we entreat.' There must be a
   season to try every grace; and therefore now God trieth us, whether we
   can with a meek humble submission yield up ourselves; or whether we are
   exasperated and drawn into bitterness of passion, yea or nay.

   3. God tries our uprightness. Many are turned out of the way by
   reproaches; the devil works much upon stomach and spleen. Tertullian
   being reproached by the priests of Rome, in revenge turns Montanist.
   Now God tries us to see whether we will hold on our course. The moon
   shines and holds on its course though the dogs bark; so a child of God
   should hold on his way though men talk their fill. In the text, though
   proud men reproached and contemned David, yet all this did not unsettle
   him. Some men can be religious no longer than when they are counted to
   be religious; but when their secular interest is in danger, they fall
   off. Thus when men injure them, they do as it were take a revenge upon
   God himself. Those carnal men that fall off from God are like pettish
   servants that run away from their master when he strikes them; a good
   servant will take a buffet patiently, and go about his master's work;
   and if we were seasoned as we should be for God, we would pass through
   evil report and good report,' 2 Cor. vi. 8, and still keep our
   integrity.

   Thirdly, God ordereth this grievous and sharp affliction to do you good
   or to better you. Reproach is like soap, which seems to defile clothes,
   but it cleanseth them. There is nothing so bad but we may make some
   good use of it, a Christian may gain some advantage by it. Dung seems
   to stain the grass, but it makes the ground fruitful, and to rise up at
   spring with a fresh verdure. Reproaches are a necessary help to a godly
   conversation, to make us walk with more care; and therefore there is
   another piece of holy revenge we should take upon them, to make us walk
   more strictly and more watchfully, the more they slander us and speak
   of us as evil-doers; the way is not to contend for esteem, so much as
   to stop their mouths by a good apology. Passionate returns will but
   increase sin, but a holy conversation will silence them.

   Use 2. To them that either devise or receive reproaches; both are very
   sinful.

   First, To you that devise them, that speak reproachfully of others.
   Consider--

   1. You hazard the repute of your own sincerity: James i. 26, Whosoever
   seemeth religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own
   heart, this man's religion is vain.' Hypocrites, and men that put
   themselves into a garb of religion, and are all for censuring, take a
   mighty freedom this way; these men bewray the rottenness of their
   hearts. Those that are so much abroad are seldom at home; they do not
   inquire and look into their own hearts. Alas! in our own sight we
   should be the worst of men. The children of God do ever thus speak of
   themselves as the least of saints,' the greatest of sinners,' more
   brutish than any men,' of sinners whereof I am chief.' Why? Because we
   can know others only by guess and imagination, but they can speak of
   themselves out of inward feeling; therefore we should have a deeper
   sense of our own condition. But now a man that is much in judging and
   reproving others is seldom within; for if he did but consider himself,
   if he had but an account of his own failings, he would not be so apt to
   blemish others. It is a cheap zeal to let fly at the miscarriages and
   sins of others, and to allow our own. Consider, thou hast enough to
   observe already in thyself.

   2. You rob them of the most precious treasure. He that robs thee of thy
   name is the worst kind of thief: Prov. xxii. 1, A good name is rather
   to be chosen than great riches.' A man that is taken pilfering another
   man's goods, he is ashamed when he is found; so should a censurer: you
   rob him of a more excellent treasure.

   3. You offend God, and draw public hatred. It is the devil's work to be
   the accuser of the brethren,' Rev. xii. 10. The devil doth not commit
   adultery, doth not break the Sabbath, nor dishonour parents; these are
   not laws given to him. If the devil will bear false witness, he is an
   accuser of the brethren; it is the devil's proper sin, and therefore
   slanderer and devil have one name, Diabolus.

   Object. But must we in no case speak evil of another? or may we not
   speak of another's sin in no case?

   Sol. 1. It is a very hard matter to speak any evil of another without
   sin; for if it be without cause, then it is downright slander, and is
   against truth; if it be for a light and small cause, then it is against
   charity; if it be for things indifferent, or for lesser failings,
   indiscretions, or weaknesses, still it is against charity: James iv.
   11, Speak not evil one of another, brethren.' It is worse in brethren.
   Many take liberty to traduce God's choice servants that are in
   difference. For a soldier to speak evil of soldiers, or a scholar of
   scholars, is worse than for. those that hate these functions. So for
   you, Christians, to speak evil one of another, you gratify the triumphs
   of hell, and bring a reproach upon the ways of Christ. In things
   doubtful, judge the best; in things hidden and secret we can take no
   cognisance: when the fact is open, we do not know the aim nor the
   intent of the heart. It is the devil's work to judge thus: Doth Job
   serve God for nought?' when he could not traduce his action. If the
   practice be open and public, we do not know what alleviating
   circumstances it may bear, what grievous temptations they had, or
   whether they have repented, yea or nay. The devil is called a
   slanderer, because he doth accuse the saints. It is too true many times
   what he accuseth them of. Ay! but he accuseth them when they are
   pardoned; he rakes up the filth God hath covered; he accuseth the
   brethren after repentance, after they are acquitted by the Lord's
   grace; and so you may incur the like: and therefore it is a very hard
   matter to avoid sin; in one way or other we shall dash upon the
   command; better let it alone.

   2. Speak not of him, but to him; and so change a sin into a duty. I
   say, when you turn admonition into censure, you exchange a duty for a
   sin. Admonish one another,' is a thing spoken of in scripture; but
   speak not evil one of another.'

   3. If you speak of the failings of others, it should be with tenderness
   and grief; as when they are incorrigible and likely to infect others,
   or when it is for the manifest glory of God: Phil. iii. 19, There are
   some of whom I have told you often, and now tell you weeping,' &c. He
   speaks of some seducers that, under the form of godliness, did under
   mine the purport of the Christian religion, merely took up the
   profession of it for their own ends. It should be done with a mighty
   deal of caution; not out of idleness for want of talk that is babble;
   not out of hatred and revenge--that is malice: though the matter is
   true, yet we must not speak of men's faults to please others--that is
   flattery.

   Secondly, To them that receive the slander. He is a slanderer that
   wrongs his neighbours' credit by upholding an ill report against them.
   It is hard to say which is worse, railing or receiving. Ps. xv. 3, when
   an inhabitant of Sion is described, it is said, He that receiveth not a
   report, and takes it not up against his neighbour;' so Prov. xvii. 4, A
   wicked doer giveth heed to false lips, and a liar giveth ear to a
   naughty tongue.' It is not only a point of wickedness to have a naughty
   tongue or false lips, but to give heed. He is a liar that receiveth a
   lie, and loves it when brought to him. God will plague all those that
   love lies. As in treason, all that are acquainted with the plot are
   responsible; so you are responsible for your ears, as they for their
   tongue. It is good to have a spiritual tongue, that will heal the
   wounds that others make in men's reputation: Prov. xii. 18, There is
   that speaketh like the piercings of a sword; but the tongue of the wise
   is health.' Some carry a sword in their mouths, others balsam to heal
   the wounds that are made.

   Use 3. If this be so usual and grievous an affliction, and that even to
   the children of God, and that not only upon the account of nature, but
   of grace, then it puts us upon seeking comfort against reproaches.

   1. The witness of a good conscience within. If you be innocent, it is
   not against thee they speak, but against another, whom the slanderer
   takes thee to be. The hair will grow again though it be shaven, as long
   as the roots remain. A good conscience is the root of a good credit;
   and though the razor of censure hath brought on baldness, yet it will
   grow again. God will either turn their hearts or support thee under it.

   2. Reproaches cannot make thee vile in God's sight. The world's filth
   many times are God's jewels. Many that were praised in the world are
   now in hell, and many that were disgraced in the world are in great
   favour and esteem with God; many times their contempt doth increase
   their esteem with God, and therefore they cannot hurt thee. They may
   persecute thee; but if thou be patient, they cannot impose upon thee,
   and burden thy cause in his eyes.' God doth not ask the world's vote
   and suffrage whether such and such shall be justified or received into
   glory, yea or nay. If they be infirmities and defects, humble thyself,
   and God will cover them, Ps. xxxii. 1. God is wont to scatter
   reproaches cast upon his children, as the sun scatters the clouds, Ps.
   xxxvii., and heaven will make amends for all.

   3. The profit thou gainest by them, the watchfulness, the diligence,
   all this will be sweet. I might have given comfort against reproaches
   for religion. These are honourable, they are the reproaches of Christ,
   Heb. xi. 26; Heb. xiii. 13. It is as honourable before God as
   ignominious before men. And we cannot expect better fare than our
   master: The disciple is not above his lord, nor the servant above his
   master: it is enough for the disciple to be as his lord, and the
   servant as his master,' Mat. x. 24, 25. We cannot expect to fare bet
   ter than Christ did, and it is an honour to suffer as he did.

   Again, if cripples mock us for going upright, let us pity them. The
   judgment of wicked men is depraved, not to be stood upon; and this
   contempt one day will be cast upon themselves: Ps. xlix. 14, The
   upright shall have dominion over them in the morning.'
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON XXIV.

   Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did meditate
   in thy statutes.--Ver. 23.

   THIS psalm expresseth David's affection to the word, as the result of
   all that experience which he had of the comfort and use of it. In the
   present verse two things:--

   1. David's trouble.

   2. His remedy.

   1. His trouble, princes did sit and speak against me.

   2. The remedy that he used, but thy servant did meditate in thy
   statutes.

   First, The evil wherewith he was exercised. There are several
   circumstances produced by way of aggravation of his trouble:--

   1. Who? Princes also;' his trial came not only from the contempt and
   reproach of base people, spoken of in the former verse, but from
   princes also, by whom are meant Saul's courtiers and counsellors.

   2. How? Did sit;' not only when occasionally met together in private in
   their chambers or at their tables, but when they sat in council, or
   when they sat together on the seat of judgment, they consulted to ruin
   him; or upon the throne (where nothing but just and holy should be
   expected) passed a judicial sentence against him.

   3. What? Did speak against me;' it was not reproach only that troubled
   him, but the powers of the world gave false sentence against him. To be
   spoken of as an evil-doer is a less temptation than to be condemned as
   a malefactor.

   Secondly, His remedy; where observe--

   1. The title he gives himself, but thy servant.' He speaketh modestly
   of himself, in the third person; and fitly doth he say, thy servant.'
   We owe duty to a higher master, when they decree anything contrary to
   God's word.

   2. His practice and exercise, Did meditate on thy statutes.' This is
   spoken for two reasons:--

   [1.] That he was not discouraged by their opposition, but held to his
   duty; he was maligned for God's word's sake, and yet kept up his
   respect to the word of God, and never left meditating therein.

   [2J To show the way of his relief and cure under this trouble, by
   exercising himself in the word, which in the next verse he showeth.
   yielded him a double benefit--comfort and counsel.

   (1.) It was of use to comfort him and strengthen faith.

   (2.) To direct him that he might keep within the bounds of true
   obedience; there being in the word of God both sweet promises and a
   sure rule.

   Observe from the evil wherewith he was exercised:--

   Doct. It is many times the lot of God's people that princes do sit and
   speak against them in councils and upon the throne of judgment.

   1. For consulting against them to their ruin. We have instances of a
   council gathered against Christ: John xi. 47, Then gathered the chief
   priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man
   doth many miracles.' They meet together, and plot the ruin of Christ
   and his kingdom; and they were those that were of chief authority in
   the place. Another instance: Acts iv. 27, 28, For of a truth against
   thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod and Pontius
   Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered
   together, for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined
   before to be done.' There is their agreement to put Christ to death. In
   the Old Testament, Pharaoh and his nobles: Exod. i. 10, Come on,
   katasophizo'metha, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply,
   and it come to pass, that when there falleth out any war, they join
   also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of
   the land.' And against Daniel the princes of the Persian empire consult
   how to entrap him in the matter of his God, Dan. vi. 4-6, &c.

   2. For abusing the throne of judgment and civil courts of judicature,
   to the molestation of the saints. I shall cite but two places: Ps.
   xciv. 20, Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which
   frameth mischief by a law?' It is no strange, but yet no small
   temptation, that the oppression of God's people is marked with a
   pretence and colour of law and public authority, and the mischief
   should proceed from thence where it should be remedied, namely, from
   the seat of justice. So, Mat. x. 17, 18, Christ foretelleth they shall
   have enemies armed with power and public authority: Beware of men, for
   they will deliver you to the councils, and they shall scourge you in
   their synagogues, and ye shall be brought before governors and kings
   for my sake.' Not only subordinate, but supreme governors may be drawn
   to condemn and oppress the godly. In so plain a case more instances
   need not.

   Reasons of it, on God's part, and on the part of the persecutors.

   First, On God's part, he permitteth it--

   1. To show that he can carry on his work though authority be against
   him, and that his people do not subsist by outward force, but the
   goodness of his providence, and so hath the sole glory of their
   preservation. When the Christian religion came first abroad in the
   world, not many noble nor many mighty were called;' the powers of the
   world were against it, and yet it held up the head, and was dispersed
   far and near. Falsehoods need some outward interest to back them, and
   the supports of a secular arm; but God's interest doth many times stand
   alone, though God doth now and then make kings nursing-fathers, and
   queens nursing-mothers,' according to his promise, Isa. xlix. 23.
   Oftentimes the church is destitute of all worldly props: Micah v. 7,
   And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew
   from the Lord, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for
   man, nor waiteth for the sons of men.' Yea, the power of the world is
   against it, and yet it subsists. Thus it was in the primitive times;
   there were only a handful of contemptible people that professed the
   gospel; yet it got ground daily, not by force of arms or the power of
   the long sword, but by God's secret blessing. Ambrose giveth the reason
   why God suffered it to be so, Ne videretur auctoritate traxisse
   aliquos, et veritatis ratio non pompae gratiâ praevaleret--lest this
   new religion should seem to be planted with power rather than by its
   own evidence, and the authority of men should sway more with the world
   than the truth of God. There is a wonderful increase without any human
   concurrence, as the Lord saith, The remnant of his people shall be as a
   dew from the Lord, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons
   of men,' without man's consent or concurrence. So that God alone hath
   the glory of their preservation.

   2. That the patience of his people may be put to the utmost probation.
   When they are exercised with all kinds of trials, not only the hatred
   of the vulgar, but the opposition of the magistrate, carried on under a
   form of legal procedure. In the primitive times, sometimes the
   Christians were exposed to the hatred and fury of the people, lapidibus
   nos invadit inimicum vulgus; at other times exposed to the injuries of
   laws, and persecutions carried on by authority against them. There was
   an uproar at Ephesus against the Christians, Acts xix., and there
   seemed to be a formal process at Jerusalem, Acts iv. This latter
   temptation seemeth to be the more sore and grievous, because God's
   ordinance, which is magistracy, is wrested to give countenance to
   malicious designs, and because it cuts off all means of human help, and
   so patience hath e'rgon te'leion., its perfect work,' James i. 4. There
   is some glory in suffering the rage and evil word of the vulgar, for
   they are supposed not to make the wisest choice; but when men of wisdom
   and power, and such as are clothed with the majesty of God's ordinance,
   are set against us, then is patience put to the utmost proof, and
   whether we regard God or man most, and who is the object of our fear,
   those that have power of life and death temporal, or him that hath
   power of life and death eternal.

   3. That his people may be weaned from fleshly dependencies, and doting
   upon civil powers, and so be driven to depend upon him alone. Ps. xciv.
   20-22, Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which
   establish mischief by a law? They gather themselves together against
   the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood. But the Lord
   is my defence, and my God is the rock of my refuge.' There would not be
   such use of faith and dependence upon God if our danger were not great.
   It is harder to trust in God with means than without means. We are
   beaten out when outward helps fail, otherwise we are apt to neglect
   God, and then a world of mischief ensueth. When the emperor of the
   Romans began to favour the Christians, poison was said to be poured
   into the church; and in the sunshine of worldly countenance, like green
   timber, they began to warp and cleave asunder; and what religion got in
   breadth it lost in strength and vigour. God's people never live up to
   the beauty and majesty of their principles so much as when they are
   forced immediately to live upon God, and depend upon him for their
   safety.

   4. That their testimony and witness-bearing to God's truths may be the
   more public and authentic in the view of the world. This testimony is
   either to them for their conviction and conversion: Mat. xxiv. 14, And
   this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world, for a
   witness unto all nations;' or against them: Mat. x. 18, And ye shall be
   brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against
   them and the Gentiles.' It is for a testimony, and that should comfort
   them in all their sufferings: Mark xiv. 9, Verily I say unto you,
   Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world,
   this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.'
   The testimony is more valid as being confirmed by their courage in
   troubles; they are principles that they will suffer for; which, as it
   is a warning to the professors of religion that they should own no
   principles in a time of peace but what they would confirm by their
   avowed testimony in the extremity of trials; so also it should convince
   their enemies in case they be put upon this exercise. It is needful
   that every truth should have a sealed testimony; that is, we should not
   only vent opinions, but be willing to suffer for them if God should
   call us out so to do. God hath been ever tender of imposing upon the
   world without sufficient evidence, and therefore would not have his
   people stand upon their lives and temporal concernments, that thereby
   they may give greater satisfaction to the world concerning the weight
   of those truths which they do profess.

   Secondly, On the persecutors' part, or the persons molesting; so the
   causes are--

   1. Their ignorance and blind zeal: John xvi. 2, They shall put you out
   of their synagogues; yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you
   will think that they do God good service.' They think it to be an
   acceptable service to God to molest and trouble those that are indeed
   his people. Those princes that sat and spake against David were not
   pagans and men of another religion, but of Israel; and it is often the
   lot of God's people to be persecuted, not only by pagans and openly
   profane men, but even by men that profess the true
   religion--pseudo-Christians, Rev. xiv. 13, those that pretend they are
   for God and his cause, and seem to be carried on with a great zeal, and
   do not oppose truth as truth, but their quarrel is coloured by specious
   pretences.

   2. Their prejudices lightly taken up against the people of God. Satan
   is first a liar, and then a murderer: John viii. 44, Ye are of your
   father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do: he was a
   murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there
   is no truth in him: when he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own, for
   he is a liar, and the father of it.' By lies he bringeth about his
   bloody design. Christ was first called a Samaritan, and one that had a
   devil; and then they did persecute him as such a one. And, as was
   observed before, as Christians of old were covered with the skins of
   wild beasts, that dogs and lions might tear them the more speedily, so
   by odious imputations God's people are brought into distaste with the
   world, and then molested and troubled, represented as a company of
   hypocrites and unjust dealers; and under that cloak, true religion is
   undermined. Now, in the persecutor, this is faulty, because they
   lightly take up every false suggestion; and so Christians are condemned
   dia` te`n phe'men, as Justin Martyr complained, because of the common
   reproach, without any distinct inquiry into their way and practice,
   nolunt audire quod auditum damnare non possunt.

   3. Their erroneous principle in civil policy, that Christ's kingdom and
   the freedom of his worshippers is not consistent with civil interests.
   Whatever hath been the matter, worldly rulers have been jealous of
   Christ's interest and kingdom, as if it could not consist with public
   safety, and the civil interests of that state and nation where it is
   admitted; and suggestions of this kind do easily prevail with them:
   Esther iii. 8, It is not for the king's profit to suffer them;' and
   John xi. 48, If we let him alone, all men will believe on him, and the
   Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.' Reason of
   state is an ancient plea against the interest of religion. In the Roman
   empire, though the Christians were inconsiderable as to any public
   charge, yet they had a jealous eye upon them. Justin Martyr showeth the
   reason of it, o'ti basilei'an onoma'zomen, because they were often
   speaking of a kingdom; though they meant it of the kingdom of heaven,
   and were far enough from all rebellion.

   Use 1. It informeth us that we should not measure the verity of
   religion by the greatness of those that are with it or against it. This
   was one of the Pharisees' arguments, Do any of the rulers believe in
   him? But this people, that know not the law, are accursed.' John vii.
   48, 49. Alas! men of authority and great place may be often against
   God's interest: James ii. 1, Have not the faith of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, the Lord of glory, in respect of persons.' Mark that title that
   is given to Christ, the Lord of glory;' he is able to put glory enough
   upon his worshippers, though they have nothing of outward pomp and
   splendour; and not many mighty are called,' 1 Cor. i. 26. Many will say
   they have none of quality to join with them, none but ignorant people.
   If a man had judged so in the first times, when the gospel came first
   abroad in the world, would not Christianity itself have seemed a very
   contemptible thing? Therefore a simple, plain-hearted love to Christ
   and his truth, whether powers be averse or friendly, is that which is
   required of us.

   2. It reproveth those who are soon discouraged with the reproach base
   people cast upon the ways of God. David stood both in the one
   temptation and in the other, the reproach and contempt of the vulgar,
   and also when princes sat and spake against him. But to these we may
   say, as Jer. xii. 5, If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have
   wearied thee, then how wilt thou contend with horses?' If we be such
   tender milksops that we cannot suffer a disgraceful word from the
   basest of the people, what shall we do when we meet with other manner
   of conflicts and oppositions in the farther progress of our duty to
   God? If we are tired out with-the disgrace and affronts of these mean
   ones, and cannot put up with a scornful word at their hands without
   disorder, what shall we do when we are to contest for God's interest
   with those great and masterly ones that are armed with power and
   authority, and it may be the advantage of laws against us? Scommata
   nostra ferre non potes, said the Antiochians to Julian in another case,
   quomodo feres Persarum tela? God's servants do often receive
   discouragement from the people and from authority, but the goodness of
   their cause and the favour of God makes them joyfully persevere.

   3. It teacheth us what to do when this is not our case. I have treated
   as this scripture hath led me of the oppositions of princes and worldly
   powers against the people of God; it may be you may judge it
   unseasonable; but how soon it may be seasonable you cannot tell,
   considering the spirit of enmity against the power of godliness.
   Blessed be God that it is not so seasonable now. But what use shall we
   now make of it?

   [1.] To bless God when he giveth religious rulers, and such as are well
   affected to religion. It is a fulfilling of his promise: Isa. xlix. 23,
   And kings shall be thy nursing-fathers, and queens thy
   nursing-mothers.' God's interest in the world is usually weak, and his
   people, like little children, had need to be nursed up by the
   countenance and defence of worldly potentates. Now, when they discharge
   their duty, and do afford patronage and protection, it should be
   acknowledged to God's glory, in whose hands their hearts are; and the
   rather by us, because of the iron yoke that was upon us, and those hard
   task masters under which we formerly groaned. We have our own
   discontents, as well as former ages; but because all things are not as
   we could wish them, shall we be thankful for none? The liberty of
   religion is such a blessing as we cannot enough acknowledge, and doth
   sufficiently countervail other inconveniences. Oh! therefore let us not
   sour our spirits into an unthankful frame, by dwelling too much upon
   our discontents and private dissatisfactions; it is a mercy that the
   sword of authority is not drawn against religion. When God meaneth good
   or evil to a nation, he usually dispenseth it by their magistrates. If
   good, then he puts wisdom and grace into the hearts of those that
   govern, or government into the hands of those that are wise and
   gracious. When he meaneth evil, he sendeth them evil magistrates: Isa.
   xix. 4, The Egyptians will I give over into the hands of a cruel lord,
   and a fierce king shall rule over them.' But when good governors, it is
   a mercy, and a presage of good.

   [2.] To pity those whose case it is that princes sit and speak against
   them, as it is of many of the people of God now in the world. When we
   suffer not by immediate and direct passion, we should suffer by way of
   fellow-feeling and compassion. It is charged as a great crime that
   those that were at ease in Sion were not grieved for the afflictions of
   Joseph,' Amos vi. 6, compared with the 1st verse. It may be used
   proverbially; as the butler forgat Joseph when he was well at court;
   and his brethren did eat bread and little regarded the afflictions of
   his soul when cast into the pit. But I suppose them literally, because
   the half tribe of Manasseh was carried captive by Tiglath Pileser, that
   they did not sympathise with them, propter confractionem Joseph--for
   the breach made upon Joseph. God layeth affliction upon some of his
   people, to try the sympathy of others; as on Protestants in Poland, the
   emperor's dominions, Savoy, some parts of France, and elsewhere.

   [3.] To be the more strict and holy, and improve this good day of the
   church's peace. They that are not holy in a time of peace will not be
   holy and constant in a time of trouble: Acts ix. 31, When the churches
   had rest, they walked in the fear of God, and in the comforts of the
   Holy Ghost.' When we are not called to passive obedience and suffering,
   our active obedience should be the more cheerfully performed. Now where
   is it so? Our fathers suffered more willingly for Christ than we speak
   of him. Our inward peace and comfort will cost us more in getting, and
   therefore we should be more in service. Oh! let us not abuse this rest
   we have, to the neglect of God, or to vain contentions, as green timber
   warpeth and breaketh in the sun shine. The contentions of the pastors,
   saith Eusebius, did usher in the truth, [9] which was Diocletian's
   persecution.

   [4.] Here is caution, and a word of counsel to the princes of the
   nations, or the heads of the people, that now are met together and sit
   in council. Oh! do not sit and speak against such as are God's people;
   that is, do not decree anything against them. Some would have the
   magistrate to do nothing in religion; but that would leave things at a
   strange loose and disorder. Certainly you should at least provide for
   the liberties of God's people, that they should lead a quiet life in
   godliness and honesty,' 1 Tim. ii. 2; that they may be secured, and the
   peace kept, not only as to their civil interests, but whilst they
   worship God according to their conscience, which can never be as long
   as those swarms of libertines are publicly tolerated, which every day
   increase in number, power, and malice. And again, the great security of
   magistrates lieth in an oath of fealty, which only receiveth value from
   religion; therefore the magistrate is concerned in what religion is
   professed in a nation, as well as in things civil. But now, whilst you
   interpose in religion, be sure you do not contradict or undermine God's
   interest; and be not courted by any prepossessions of your own, or the
   crafty insinuations of others, to oppress by your sentence and suffrage
   those that fear God in the land, and do make conscience of their ways.
   The magistrate's interposing in religion is to me an un questionable
   duty, and yet to be managed with great caution: Ps. ii. 10, Be wise
   now, therefore, O ye kings, and be instructed, ye judges of the earth.'
   What by natural prejudices against the strict and more severe ways of
   godliness, what by private whispers and subtle disguises, men may be
   tempted to oppose Christ's kingdom, cause, and people; therefore they
   should be wary, as they would be faithful in their places, and love
   their own souls, to go upon sure clear grounds. You are to promote
   Christ's service, otherwise you will be answer able for your neglect;
   and yet you are to take heed, lest, whilst you think you do God
   service, you subvert not his interest, and so you be answerable for
   your mistake. To deal more particularly would be a diversion. I only
   intend it as a warning, and to show you the necessity of consulting
   with those who are best able to judge in the case where your duty
   lieth.

   Secondly, David's remedy: But thy servant did meditate in thy
   statutes.'

   Doct. The best way to ease the heart from trouble that doth arise from
   the opposition of men of power and place, is by serious consulting with
   God's word.

   Because the time will not bear a large prosecution, I shall open the
   force of this clause in three propositions.

   1. A holy divertisement is the best way to ease the trouble of our
   thoughts. Certainly it is not good altogether to pore upon our sorrows;
   a diversion is a prudent course. David did not merely sit down and
   bemoan the calamity of his condition, and so sink under the burden, but
   runneth to the word. As husbandmen, when their ground is overflowed by
   waters, make ditches and water-furrows to carry it away; so when our
   minds and thoughts are overwhelmed with trouble, it is good to divert
   them to some other matter. But every diversion will not become saints;
   it must be a holy diversion: Ps. xciv. 19, In the multitude of my
   thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul.' The case was the same
   with that of the text, when the throne of iniquity frameth mischief by
   a law; as you shall see here, when he had many perplexed thoughts about
   the abuse of power against himself. But now where lay his ease in
   diversion? Would every diversion suit his purpose? No; Thy comforts,'
   of God's allowance, of God's providing, comforts proper to saints.
   Wicked men in trouble run to their pot and pipe, and games and sports,
   and merry company, and so defeat the providence rather than improve it;
   but David, who was God's servant, must have God's comforts. So else
   where, when his thoughts were troubled about the power of the wicked, I
   went into the sanctuary, there I understood their end:' Ps. lxxiii. 17.
   He goeth to divert his mind by the use of God's ordinances, and so came
   to be settled against the temptation.

   2. Among all sorts of holy divertisements none is of such use as God's
   word. There is matter enough to take up our thoughts and allay our
   cares and fears, and to swallow up our sorrows and griefs, to direct us
   in all straits. In brief, there is comfort there and counsel there.

   [1.] Comfort, whilst the word teacheth us to look off from men to God,
   from providence to the covenant, from things temporal to things
   eternal, from men to God, as Moses feared not the wrath of the king
   when he saw him that is invisible,' Heb. xi. 27; and Eccles. v. 8, If
   thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perversion of
   judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter; for he
   that is higher than the highest regardeth, and there be higher than
   they.' There is a higher judge that sitteth in heaven; and if he pass
   sentence for us when they pass sentence against us, we need to be the
   less troubled. If he give us the pardon of sins and the testimony of a
   good conscience, it is no matter what men say against us: Ps. xl. 4,
   Blessed is the man that maketh the Lord his trust, and respecteth not
   the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.' Is not God able to bear you
   out in his work? From providence to the covenant: providence is a very
   riddle; we shall not know what to make of it till we gather principles
   of faith from the covenant: Heb. xiii. 5, He hath said, I will never
   leave thee nor forsake thee.' God overrules all for good: Rom. viii.
   28, We know that all things work together for good to those that love
   God, to those that are the called according to his purpose.' From
   things temporal to eternal: 2 Cor. iv. 17, 18, For our light
   affliction, that is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more
   exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while we look not at the things
   which are seen, but at the things which are not seen; for the things
   which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are
   eternal;' Rom. viii. 18, For I reckon that the sufferings of this
   present time are not worthy to be compared to the glory that shall be
   revealed in us.' A feather or a straw against a talent, a man would be
   ashamed to compare them together.

   [2.] For counsel. A Christian should not be troubled so much about what
   he should suffer, as what he should do, that he may do nothing unseemly
   to his calling and hopes, but be kept blameless to the heavenly
   kingdom. Now, the word of God will teach him how to carry himself in
   dangers, to pray for persecutors (fire is not quenched with fire, nor
   evil overcome with evil); how to keep ourselves from unlawful shifts
   and means, how to avoid revenge, lying, flattering, yielding against
   conscience, or waxing weary of well-doing, that we may not fight
   against Satan or his instruments by their own weapons, for so we shall
   be easily overcome. The wicked shall not be so wise to contrive the
   mischief, as a saint instructed by the word is how to carry himself
   under it: Ps. cxix. 98, Through thy commandments thou hast made me
   wiser than my enemies.' Malice and policy shall not teach them to
   persecute, as God's word to carry yourselves in the trouble.

   3. The word must not be slightly read, but our hearts must be exercised
   in the meditation of it. A cursory reading doth not work upon us so
   much as serious thoughts. In all studies, meditation is both the mother
   and nurse of knowledge, and so it is of godliness, without which we do
   but know truths by rote and hearsay, and talk one after another like
   parrots; but when a truth is chased into the heart by deep inculcative
   thoughts, then it worketh with us, and we feel the power of it. Musing
   maketh the fire burn, ponderous thoughts are the bellows that blow it
   up. Eggs come to be quickened by sitting abrood upon them. In a
   sanctified heart the seeds of comfort by meditation come to maturity;
   by constant meditation our affections are quickened, this turneth the
   promises into marrow: Ps. lxiii. 5, 6, My soul shall be filled as with
   marrow and fatness, when I meditate on thee in the night watches.' It
   giveth more than a vanishing taste, which hypocrites have.

   Use 1. In all your troubles learn this method, to cure them by gracious
   means, prayer or meditation. By meditation on the word of God, that
   will tell you that we are born to trouble, and therefore we should no
   more think it strange to see God's children molested here than to see a
   shower of rain fall after a sunshine, or that the night should succeed
   the day: 1 Peter iv. 12, Beloved, think it not strange concerning the
   fiery trial, as though some strange thing happened unto you.' It were
   strange if otherwise; as if a man were told that his journey lay
   through a rough stony country, and should pass over a smooth
   carpet-way. Our waymark is many tribulations: Acts xiv. 22, Through
   many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of heaven.' God had
   one Son without sin, none without the cross.

   2. That afflictions, though in themselves they are legal punishments,
   fruits of sin, yet by the grace of God they are medicinal to his
   people: 1 Cor. xi. 32, When we are judged, we are chastened of the
   Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.'

   3. We never advance more in Christianity than under the cross: Heb.
   xii. 10, They verily for a few days chastened us after their own
   pleasure, but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his
   holiness;' Ps. cxix. 71, It is good for me that I have been afflicted,
   that I might learn thy statutes.'

   4. Rather undergo the greatest calamities than commit the smallest sin:
   Heb. xi. 25, Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of
   God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.'

   5. That all crosses are nothing to desertions of God and terrors of
   conscience: Prov. xviii. 14, The spirit of a man will sustain his
   infirmities; but a wounded spirit who can bear?'

   6. That a meek suffering conduceth much to God's glory: 1 Peter iv. 14,
   If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the
   Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil
   spoken of, but on your part he is glorified;' whilst you do nothing
   unworthy of his presence in you and the truth you profess.

SERMON XXV.

   Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors.--Ver. 24.

   DAVID in the former verse had mentioned the greatness of his trial,
   that not only the basest sort, but princes also were set against him.
   Then he mentions his remedy; he had recourse to God's word, But thy
   servant did meditate in thy statutes.'

   Now he shows the double benefit which he had by the word of God, not
   only wisdom how to carry himself during that trouble, but also comfort;
   comfort in trouble, and counsel in duty; it seasoned his affliction and
   guided his business and affairs. What would a man have more in such a
   perplexed case than be directed and comforted? David had both these,
   Thy testimonies are my delight and my counsellors.'

   First, Thy testimonies are my delight; or, as it is in the Hebrew,
   delights.

   Secondly, They are my counsellors. In the Hebrew it is, the men of my
   counsel, which is fitly mentioned, for he had spoken of princes sitting
   in council against him. Princes do nothing without the advice of their
   privy council; a child of God hath also his privy council, God's
   testimonies. On the one side there was Saul and his nobles and
   councillors; on the other side there was David and God's testimonies.
   Now who were better furnished, think you, they to persecute and trouble
   him, or David how to carry himself under this trouble? Alphonsus, king
   of Arragon, being asked who were the best counsellors, answered, the
   dead; meaning books, which cannot flatter, but do without partiality
   declare the truth. Now of all such dead counsellors, God's testimonies
   have the pre-eminence. A poor godly man, even then when he is deserted
   of all, and hath nobody to plead for him, he hath his senate and his
   council of state about him, the prophets and apostles, and other holy
   men of God, that spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.' A man so
   furnished is never less alone than when alone; for he hath counsellors
   about him that tell him what is to be believed or done; and they are
   such counsellors as cannot err, as will not flatter him, nor applaud
   him in any sin, nor discourage nor dissuade him from that which is
   good, whatever hazards it expose him to. And truly, if we be wise, we
   should choose such counsellors as these, Thy testimonies are the men of
   my counsel.'

   First, Let me speak of the first benefit, Thy testimonies are my
   delight.'

   Doct. That a child of God, though under deep affliction, finds a great
   deal of delight and comfort in the word of God.

   This was David's case, princes sat and spake against him, decrees were
   made against him, yet thy testimonies are my delight.' Let us see--

   1. What manner of delight this is that we find in the word.

   2. What the word ministereth or contributeth towards it.

   First, What kind of delight it is? A delight better than carnal
   rejoicing. Wicked men, that flow in ease and plenty, have not so much
   comfort as a godly man hath in the enjoyment of God, according to the
   tenor of his word: Ps. iv. 7, Thou hast put more gladness into my
   heart, than when their corn, wine, and oil increased.' We have no
   reason to change conditions with worldly men, as merry as they seem to
   be, and as much as they possess in the world.

   But more particularly, wherein is the difference?

   1. This delight is a real joy: 2 Cor. vi. 10, As sorrowful, yet always
   rejoicing.' Their sorrow is but seeming, but their joy is real; it is
   joy in good earnest: Heb. xii. 11, No affliction seemeth joyous but
   grievous.' As to seeming, they are in a sad condition, but it doth but
   so seem. A wicked man is as it were glad and merry, but indeed he is
   dejected and sorrowful; the godly man is as it were sorrowful, but
   indeed comforted.

   2. It is a cordial joy: Ps. iv. 7, Thou hast put more gladness into my
   heart.' That is a delight indeed which puts a gladness into the heart,
   which not only tickles the outward senses, but affects the soul and
   comforts the conscience. Carnal joy makes a loud noise, and therefore
   it is compared to the crackling of thorns under a pot;' but this is
   that which goes to the heart, that fills it with serenity and peace.
   Carnal joy is like the morning dew, which wets the surface; but godly
   joy is like a soaking shower that goes to the root, and makes the plant
   flourish. They that indulge false comfort rather laugh than are merry.
   But now he that is exercised in the word of God, and fetcheth his
   comfort out of the promises, he is glad at the very heart.

   3. It is a great joy: 1 Peter, i. 8, In whom believing, ye rejoiced
   with joy unspeakable and full of glory.' It doth ravish the heart, so
   that it is better felt than uttered, it is unspeakable and glorious.
   The higher the life, always the greater the feeling. The good and evil
   of no life can be so great as the good and evil of the spiritual life,
   because it is the highest life of all, and therefore hath the highest
   sense joined with it. Man is more capable of being afflicted than
   beasts, and beasts than plants, and a godly man more than other men; he
   hath a higher life, therefore the good and evil is greater. A wounded
   spirit is the greatest misery any creature can feel on this side hell.
   So answerably are its joys: as the groans and sorrows of the spiritual
   life are unutterable, so are the joys of it unspeakable.

   4. It is a more pure joy than worldlings can have. The more
   intellectual any comfort is, the more excellent in the kind. Though
   beasts may have pain and pleasure poured in upon them by the senses,
   yet properly they have not sorrow and delight. The joy of carnal men is
   pleasure rather than delight; it is not fed by the promises and
   ordinances, but by such dreggy and outward contentments as the world
   affords, and so of the same nature with the contentment of the beasts.
   But now the more intellectual and chaste our delights are, the more
   suitable to the human nature. Well, then, none hath a delight so
   separate from the lees as a Christian that rejoiceth in the promises of
   God. He that delights in natural knowledge, hath, questionless, a purer
   object and greater contentment of soul than the sensualist can possibly
   have, that delights only in meats, and drinks, and sports, in pleasures
   that are in common with the beasts. Further yet, he that delights in
   bare contemplation of the word, as it is an excellent doctrine suited
   to man's necessities, as the stony ground received the word with joy,'
   Mat. xiii. 20, certainly he hath yet a purer gladness than merely that
   man that is versed in natural studies. Oh! but when a man can reflect
   upon the promises, as having an interest in them, that delight which
   flows from faith, and is accompanied with such a certainty, surely that
   is a more pure delight than the other, and doth more ravish the heart;
   they have more intimate and spiritual joy than others have.

   5. It is a joy that ends well. Carnal rejoicing makes way for sorrow:
   The end of that mirth is heaviness,' Prov. xiv. 13. It is a poor forced
   thing, saith Cooper. A man in a burning fever is eased no longer by
   drinking strong drink than while he is drinking of it, for then it
   seems to cool him, but presently it increaseth his heat; so when men
   seek ease and comfort in troubles from outward external things, though
   they seem to mitigate their heaviness for the present, yet they
   increase it the more afterward.

   6. It is not a joy that perverts the heart. Carnal comforts, the more
   we use them, the more we are ensnared by them: Eccles. ii. 2, I have
   said of laughter, It is mad; and of mirth, What doth it?' For what
   serious and sober use doth carnal rejoicing serve? There is no profit
   by it, but much hurt and danger; therefore Solomon preferreth sorrow
   before it: Eccles. vii. 3, Sorrow is better than laughter; for by the
   sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.' But now, the more
   of this delight we have, the more we delight ourselves in the word of
   God, the more we love God, the better the heart is.

   7. It is a delight that overcomes the sense of our affliction, and all
   the evils that do befall us; and therefore it is said of the heirs of
   promise that they have strong consolation,' Heb. vi. 18. The strength
   is seen by the effects; therefore it is strong, because it supports and
   revives, notwithstanding troubles. It establisheth the heart,
   notwithstanding all the floods and storms of temptations that light
   upon it: 1 Thes. i. 6, it is said of them, that they received the word
   with much, affliction and joy in the Holy Ghost.'

   Secondly, How do we find it in the word? His testimonies are my
   delight.' The word requires this joy in troubles, and the word
   ministers it to the soul.

   It requires this joy: James i. 2, Count it all joy when ye fall into
   divers temptations.' We are not only with patience to submit to God's
   will, but also to rejoice in it: so Mat. v. 12, When men persecute and
   revile you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my name
   sake, rejoice and be exceeding glad.' Many times when other ways of
   persecution cease, yet there is reviling. Those that have no strength
   and power to do other injuries, yet have such weapons of malice always
   in readiness. Some, being not good Christians themselves, will defame
   those that are so; that so, when they cannot reach them in practice,
   they may depress them by censure; when they cannot go so high as they,
   they may bring them as low as themselves by detraction. Now, though
   this be a great evil, we should bear it not heavily but cheerfully;
   rejoice and be exceeding glad in hope of the promises: Rom. v. 3, We
   glory in tribulation.' A true believer, that hath received the word of
   God as the rule of his life and guide of his hopes, he can not only be
   patient, but cheerful, glory in his tribulation. A carnal man is not so
   comfortable in his best estate as he at his worst.

   Again, it gives us matter and ground of joy. God speaks a great deal of
   comfort to an afflicted spirit. It was one end why the scriptures were
   penned: Rom. xv. 4, That we through patience and comfort of the
   scripture might have hope;' and Heb. xii. 5, Have you forgotten the
   consolation, that speaks to you as children?' The great drift of the
   word is to provide matter of comfort, and that in our worst estate.

   But now, what are the usual comforts that may occasion this delight and
   joy in the Holy Ghost in the midst of deep affliction?

   1. The scripture gives us ground of comfort from the author of our
   afflictions, who is our Father, and never manifests the comfort of
   adoption so much as then when we are under chastening: Heb. xii. 5, The
   consolation that speaks to you as children;' and John xviii. 11, The
   cup which my Father hath put into my hands, shall I not drink it?' It
   is a bitter cup, but it is from a father, not from a judge or an enemy.
   Nothing but good can come from him who is love and goodness itself;
   nothing but what is useful from a father, whose affection is not to be
   measured by the bitterness of the dispensation, but by his aims, what
   he intends. If God should let us alone to follow our own ways, it were
   an argument we were none of his children.

   2. The necessity of affliction: 1 Peter i. 6, Ye are for a season in
   trouble, if need be.' Before the corn be ripened, it needs all kind of
   weathers, and therefore the husbandman is as glad of showers as sun
   shine, because they both conduce to fruitfulness. We need all kind of
   dispensations, and cannot well be without the many troubles that do
   befall us.

   3. The nature and use of affliction. It is a medicine, not a poison; it
   works out the remainders of sin: Isa. xxvii. 9, By this therefore shall
   the iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit, to take
   away his sin.' Afflictions are useful, and help to mortification. It is
   a file to get off our rust; a flail, wherewith we are threshed, that
   our husk may fly off; a fire to purge and eat out our dross: He verily
   for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness,' Heb. xii.
   10. If God take away any outward comforts from us, and give us graces
   instead of them, it is a blessed exchange, if he strip us of our
   garments, and clothe us with his own royal robe, as holiness is. God
   himself is glorious in holiness. Now, that we may be partakers of his
   holiness, surely that is for our profit.

   4. For the manner of God's afflicting, it is in measure: Isa. xxvii. 8,
   In measure when it shooteth forth, thou wilt debate with it. He stayeth
   his rough wind in the day of the east wind.' So Jer. xlvi. 28, Fear
   thou not, Jacob, my servant, saith the Lord,' &c. So 1 Cor. x. 13, God
   is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above measure.' His
   conduct is very gentle: as Jacob drove on as the little ones were able
   to bear, Gen. xxxiii., so doth God with a great deal of moderation
   measure out sufferings in a due proportion, not to our offences only,
   but our strength; as a father, in correcting his children, regards
   their weakness as well as their wantonness, laying less upon the more
   infirm, though alike faulty.

   5. Another comfort which the scripture propounds is the help we shall
   have in affliction to bear it, partly from the comforts of his Spirit,
   and partly from the supports of his grace.

   [1.] By way of consolation: The love of God is shed abroad in our
   hearts by the Holy Ghost' at such a time, Rom. v. 3. Cordials are for
   those that are fainting. In time of trouble we have most sensible
   experience of God's love. God deals with his children many times as
   Joseph did with his brethren; he calls them spies, and puts them in
   prison, but at length he could hold no longer, but tells them, I am
   your brother Joseph.' So God seems to deal roughly with his people, and
   take away their dearest comforts from them. Ay! but before the trouble
   be over, he can hold no longer, but saith, I am your God, your father,
   and exceeding great reward. His bowels yearn towards us, and he opens
   his heart to us, and sheds abroad his love in our conscience.

   [2.] Partly by the supports and influences of his grace: Ps. cxxxviii.
   3, In the day when I cried, thou answeredst me and strengthenedst me
   with strength in my soul.' When David was in trouble, this was his
   comfort, though he could not get deliverance yet he got support. God is
   many times gone to appearance, but he will never forsake us as to
   inward support and strength: Heb. xiii. 5, I will never leave thee nor
   forsake thee.'

   6. From the fruit and final issue of all: 2 Cor. iv. 17, This light
   affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more
   exceeding and eternal weight of glory.' He that can find Christ in his
   afflictions, and can see heaven beyond it, needs not to be troubled.
   All the notions of heaven are diversified. Why? That they may be suited
   to those divers trials and many evils we have in the world. Sometimes
   it is expressed by glory and honour, to counterbalance the disgrace
   which God's children meet with here; that the reproach of men may not
   make us more sad than the eternal glory may make us comfortable.
   Sometimes it is expressed by substance, because some times God's
   children are poor, and suffer loss of goods, Heb. x. 34. Sometimes it
   is called our redemption, our country, to comfort us in exile and
   banishment for the name of Christ, Heb. xi. 14, 15. Some times it is
   called life eternal, because we may be called to suffer even to blood.
   Thus the word offereth this comfort against all the evils that befall
   us, that we may counterbalance every particular trouble with what the
   promises hold forth concerning our blessed hopes.

   Use 1. Well, then, let us exercise ourselves in the word of God, and
   let all his promises be as so many cordials to us. To this end get an
   interest in these promises, for the heirs of promise have strong
   consolation,' Heb. vi. 18. There is strong, great, real, and pure
   comfort, but it is to the heirs of promise. So Rom. v. 4, Not only so,
   but we rejoice in tribulation.' Who are those? Those that are justified
   by faith in Christ, ver. 1. To others, afflictions are the punishments
   of sin, and an occasion of despair, not of rejoicing. Ay! but when we
   are interested in reconciliation with God, then we take this comfort
   out of the word of God.

   2. It informs us of the excellency of God's testimonies above all
   outward enjoyments. When we have them to the full, they cannot give us
   any solid true peace of conscience, nor cure one sad thought. Now beg
   of God that he will comfort you when all things else fail: When the
   labour of the olive shall fail, I will comfort myself in the Lord my
   God,' Hab. iii. 18. I say, when we are under any burden, nay, when we
   are under any sorrow for sin, when afflictions revive stings of
   conscience, or else the word hath awakened them, yet there is comfort
   to be had by running to the word of God.

   3. It shows us what is the property of believers, to delight in the
   testimonies of God, when all things go cross to them. Temporaries, when
   things run smoothly, they have a comfort in the word. Oh! but when the
   afflictions of the gospel fall upon them, they fall a murmuring
   presently. But a true believer can hold up his head; and though he hath
   much affliction, yet he can have much joy in the Holy Ghost, and a
   great deal of comfort from the word of God.

   There follows another benefit, Thy testimonies are my counsellors,' or
   men of my counsel.' From thence observe--

   Doct. 2. That one great benefit we have from the word of God is
   counsel, how to direct our affairs according to his will.

   For the clearing of this, let me lay down these propositions--

   1. That our great interest is to keep in with God, or approve ourselves
   to him.

   2. Whoever would keep in with God needs counsel and direction in all
   his ways.

   3. The only good counsel we can have is from God in his word.

   4. The counsel God hath given us in his word is sufficient and full out
   for all our necessities.

   Prop. 1. That our great interest is to keep in with God, and approve
   ourselves to him in all our actions; for God is the scope and end of
   our lives and actions, as the thing pressed, That we may walk worthy of
   God in all well-pleasing,' Col. i. 10. God, being our chiefest good,
   must be our last end; therefore in every action there must be a
   habitual purpose, and in all actions of weight and moment there must be
   an actual purpose, to please God. Every ordinary affair must be carried
   forth in the strength of the habitual purpose, but in all actions we
   would make a business of there must be an actual purpose. And because
   his authority alone can sway the conscience, which is under his
   dominion, therefore it concerns us in all things to exercise ourselves
   that we may have a good conscience, void of offence both towards God
   and man,' Acts xxiv. 16. And again, we are to approve our ways to God,
   and to keep in with him, because to him we are to give an account, 2
   Cor. v. 9, 10. There will a time come when every action of ours shall
   be taken into consideration, and weighed in the balance of the
   sanctuary, with all our principles and ends; therefore we strive, we
   are ambitious (so the word signifies); our great ambition should be,
   living or dying, to be accepted with God. Again, surely it should be
   our business to approve ourselves to God in every action, because all
   the success of our actions depends upon his concurrence and blessing.
   Now we shall find this is often asserted in scripture. When a man's
   ways are full of hazards, likely to be exposed to great opposition,
   your great work is to keep in with God, approve your hearts to him:
   Prov. xvi. 7, When a man's ways please the Lord, he will make even his
   enemies to be at peace with him.' God hath a mighty power over the
   spirits of men; therefore this is to go to the fountain-head, to stop
   all opposition there; and, on the other side, without this care of
   pleasing God, all goes to loss. Counsels, though never so wisely laid,
   yet are blasted if we do not make this our business, to approve our
   hearts to God in those actions. Remember, in one place it is said, The
   counsel of the froward is carried headlong,' Job v. 13; and in another
   place, Isa. xliv. 25, The counsel of wise men he turneth back ward.'
   When men do not study to please God, and approve their hearts to him,
   God leaves them to precipitate counsels; sometimes they are carried
   forward, at other times they are carried backward; the event is cross
   to their design. Sometimes God lets them fall into precipitant counsels
   that they may undo themselves, at other times disappoints their
   counsels, and that which they have designed.

   Prop. 2. Whosoever would keep in with God, he needs good counsel and
   direction in all his ways. Both in regard of the darkness of his
   understanding, his corrupt affections, and inordinate self-love, man is
   not able to rule and govern himself, but needs counsel: Prov. xii. 15,
   The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but he that hearkeneth unto
   counsel is wise.' When a man engageth in any action, such is the
   darkness and perverseness of man's heart that he should not be
   over-confident of his own apprehensions, or of his own inclinations,
   but should hearken after counsel; and Prov. xxviii. 26, He that
   trusteth in his own heart is a fool.' Both these proverbs are to be
   understood not so much of wise managing of civil affairs as of
   spiritual direction. Surely it is ill trusting ourselves and counsels
   and inclinations of our own hearts. Blind affections usually govern a
   man's life; and all sinners have an evil counsellor in their bosom,
   some lust or other, and therefore need to be directed. The counsel of
   the flesh is, Favour thyself. Every evil affection gives ill counsel.
   Covetousness saith, Preserve thy worldly interest. Voluptuousness
   saith, You need not be so strict and nice, and abridge yourselves of
   the comforts of the world. Paul saith, Gal. i. 16, I conferred not with
   flesh and blood.' Flesh and blood are evil counsellors, and under
   pretence of safety will suggest what is for our ruin. What will the
   flesh say when it is to be denied, and the blood say when it is to be
   spilt and shed for God's sake? These will persuade us rather to please
   ourselves than please God. They will persuade us to desert our duty.

   Prop. 3. The only good counsel that we can have is from God in his
   word: Ps. lxxiii. 24, Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and
   afterwards receive me unto glory.' We have it from God, and we have it
   from his word; for there is a guide and a rule. Man is so weak and so
   perverse that he needs both a guide and a rule. The guide is the Spirit
   of God, and the rule is the word of God: thou shalt guide me, but by
   thy counsel. By these two alone can we be led in the way to true
   happiness. The Spirit he is a sure guide; and the word, that is a clear
   rule. We are dark, but the scriptures are not dark. I observed out of
   the 18th verse, when the saints called upon God, they do not say, Lord,
   make a plainer law, but, Lord, give me better eyes. We are dark, and
   need the illumination of the Spirit; the scriptures are light: Prov.
   vi. 23, The commandment is a lamp, and the law is light.' In all
   matters of practical obedience it is clear and open.

   Prop. 4. The counsel that God hath given us in his word is sufficient
   and full out to all our necessities. Let me instance this in
   particulars.

   1. The word gives us counsel for our general choice; it is the rule of
   all faith and obedience. The scriptures are the counsel of God, sent to
   remedy the miseries of the fall; therefore it is said, Acts xx. 27, I
   have not shunned to declare unto you the whole counsel of God.' It is
   God's counsel how man should be reconciled, how he should be converted,
   and come to the enjoyment of himself. David, when he had chosen God for
   his portion, he saith, Ps. xvi. 7, Blessed be God who hath given me
   counsel.' In the word he gives us counsel how to come to him for our
   happiness, and by grace he sets it on upon the heart: this is the
   counsel of God concerning our salvation.

   2. Not only in our general choice, but in all our particular actions,
   so far as they have a tendency unto that end: Ps. cxix. 105, Thy word
   is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my paths.' It is a lamp and a
   light. We are full of darkness and error; but as we follow the
   direction of God, it is a lamp not only to our path, but to our steps,
   to our feet; not only to our path, to our general course, but it
   directeth us in every particular action.

   3. In dark and doubtful passages, when a man multiplieth consultations
   and perplexed thoughts, and changeth conclusions as a sick man doth his
   bed, and knows not what course to take, whether this or that; then the
   word will direct him what to do, so as that a man may find quiet in his
   soul. Indeed here is the question, How far the word of God is a
   counsellor to us in such perplexed and doubtful cases?

   [1.] The word of God will help him to understand how far he is
   concerned in such an action in point of duty and conscience; for other
   wise it were not able to make the man of God perfect, and thoroughly
   furnished unto all good works,' 2 Tim. iii. 17. Now it is a great
   relief to the soul when a man understands how far he is concerned in
   point of duty. The conflict many times lies not only between light and
   lust, or light and interest--then a gracious man knows what part to
   take; but when it lies between duty and duty, then it is tedious and
   troublesome to him. Now the word clearly will tell you what is your
   duty in any action, whatever it be.

   [2.] As to the prudent management of the action in order to success,
   the word will teach you to go to God for wisdom, James i. 6, and to
   observe his answer.

   [3.] So in all actions, the word will teach you to ask God's leave and
   God's blessing. Christians, it is not enough to ask God's counsel, but
   ask his leave in any particular action, in disposing our dwellings, or
   our concernments of children, and the like: Judges i., Who shall go up
   and fight against the Canaanites?' They would fain have the Lord decide
   it. And again, Shall I go up to Ramoth-Gilead?' In all actions our
   business is to ask God's leave. David always runs to the oracle and
   ephod, Shall I go up to Hebron?' And Jacob in his journeys would
   neither go to Laban nor come from him without a warrant and leave from
   God. So we ask God's leave in prayer, and observe the bent of our
   hearts after prayer.

   [4.] The word of God teacheth a man, when he understandeth his duty,
   and hath God's leave, to submit the event to God, and that easeth the
   heart, because he may be sure of success, comfort, and sup port: Ps.
   xxxvii. 5, Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him, and he
   shall bring it to pass;' and Prov. xvi. 3, Commit thy work unto the
   Lord, and thy thoughts shall be established.' It easeth us of a great
   deal of trouble and care; so that when a man hath brought his
   affections to submit to whatever God should determine in point of
   success, when he hath moderated and calmed his spirit, that he is
   resolved to bear the event whatever it be, this easeth the soul of a
   deal of trouble. Thus you see how we may make the statutes of God to be
   the men of our counsel.

   Use 1. What a singular mercy is it that God hath given us the
   scripture, where we have counsel upon all occasions, how to manage our
   affairs prudently, bear afflictions comfortably, and with composed
   hearts to get through all events and dangers that we meet with in our
   passage to heaven! We should have groped up and down, as the Sodomites
   for Lot's door, if we had not this rule of faith and obedience. It is a
   rule that teacheth us how to think well, for it reacheth to the
   thoughts; to speak well, for it giveth a law to all our words; to do
   well in all our civil actions and trading: how to keep a good
   conscience, and approve ourselves to God; how in natural actions,
   eating, drinking, to season them with God's fear; and religious
   actions, how we may pray and worship; how to govern ourselves, our own
   hearts and affections; to converse with others in all relations, as
   fathers, children, masters, servants, magistrates, ministers, people;
   and how to hold communion with God: all which are demonstrations of the
   sufficiency of the scripture for our direction, and what reason there
   is that we should take the testimonies of God to be the men of our
   counsel.

   Use 2. For reproof to those that turn the back upon God's counsels. Who
   are those?

   1. Such as neglect the general duties of Christianity, as faith, and
   repentance. God hath given us counsel what to do in order to eternal
   life, and we regard it not. The great quarrel between God and sinners
   is about the neglect of this counsel, which he hath given them for
   their soul's good: Prov. i. 25, They set at nought all my counsel;' and
   ver. 30, They would none of my counsel.' Oh! when your friends have
   advised you, and you despise it, and take another course, it troubleth
   them. You know how heinously Achitophel took it when his counsel was
   despised. Equals, when their counsel is despised, take it very ill;
   much more superiors when they give counsel. The en treaty and advice of
   a superior carrieth the force of a command. So it is here with God; it
   is called counsel, not as if it were an arbitrary thing whether we did
   regard it or no; but because of God's mild condescension. When men are
   in danger of perishing for ever, the Lord gives us counsel. You are in
   a miserable estate; he is pleased to tell you how to come out of your
   misery. The word of God, therefore, is called the counsel of God. It is
   sad when we shall reject the counsel of God: Luke vii. 30, They
   rejected the counsel of God against themselves.' There is two
   sentences, they rejected the counsel of God, and it was against
   themselves; it was to their own loss and destruction. God loseth
   nothing when we despise his counsel; but you lose all--your eternal
   happiness. This is so great an evil that God punisheth it with itself.
   When men will not take God's counsel, then it is the most dreadful
   judgment he can lay upon us to give us up to our own counsel, Ps.
   lxxxi. 11. Oh, what a heavy judgment was it to be given up to the
   counsels of their own heart!

   2. It reproves such as do not consult with God's word about their
   affairs, but merely live as they are acted by their own lusts, or walk
   at all adventures;' so the expression in the marginal reading is, Lev.
   xxvi. 21. It is as the action falls; they do not care whether it please
   God, or be the rule of their duty, yea or nay. These are far from the
   temper of God's children. It is sad in persons, much more in nations,
   when men run headlong upon all manner of disorders, against right and
   honesty; it tends to ruin: Deut. xxxii. 28, They are a nation void of
   counsel, neither is there any understanding in them.'

   3. Such as go flatly against the counsel of God, and, to gratify their
   own interest, pervert all that is just and honest: Ps. cvii. 11, They
   rebelled against the word of the Lord, and contemned the counsel of the
   Most High.' These do but expose themselves to speedy ruin. Job xviii.
   7, Bildad said of the wicked, His own counsel shall cast him down.'
   They need no other means to ruin them than their own brutish course.
   When men dare break the commandment of God without any reluctancy, to
   gratify a worldly interest, though for the present no evil comes of it,
   yet afterwards they shall smart: Prov. xix. 20, Hear counsel and
   receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise for thy latter end.'
   Consider what it will come to afterwards, when thou comest to die; then
   you will wish, Oh that I had taken God's counsel, that I had not gone
   with such a daring spirit against the plain counsel of God's word!

   4. Such as pretend to ask counsel from the word, but it is according to
   the idol of their own hearts; that come with their own conclusions and
   preconceptions and prejudices, against God's counsel: Ezek. xiv. 3, 4,
   Son of man, these have set up their idols in their heart,' &c. Men will
   come and pretend to ask God's counsel and leave upon their
   undertakings, when they are resolved upon a wicked enterprise before;
   then God must be called upon and sought to, and so they make God's
   ordinance a lacquey, merely to be a covert to their evil practices; as
   those in Jer. xlii., that came to the prophet, and they were
   prepossessed, and had their resolutions aforehand.

   Use 3. To press us to this consulting with the word of God, to make the
   testimonies of the Lord the men of our counsel. There are many
   qualifications and tempers of heart necessary.

   1. Fear of God: Ps. xxv. 12, What man is he that feareth the Lord? him
   will he teach the way that he shall choose;' he that is in doubt and
   perplexed, and would have counsel from God's word. Who is the man that
   is like to have it? He that feareth the Lord, There is a great
   suitableness between the qualification and the promise. Partly he that
   fears God hath a greater awe of the word than others have, and is loath
   to do anything contrary to God's will; he would fain know what is God's
   mind in every particular case: Ps. cxix. 161, My heart standeth in awe
   of thy word.' To offend God, and to baulk the direction of God's word,
   that is the greatest terror to him, greater than all other dangers. Now
   such a man is less apt to miscarry by the rashness and impetuous bent
   of carnal affections. And he that fears God, he aims at God's glory
   rather than his own interest, and so is rather swayed by reasons of
   conscience and religion than of carnal concernments. Many times the
   doubtfulness that is upon the spirit is because of conflicts between
   lust and knowledge; our light is weakened by an inordinate affection to
   our own interest, otherwise we would soon come to the deciding our case
   by the word of God. Now he that would fain know God's mind in
   everything, this is the man whom God will direct.

   2. The second qualification is the meek:' Ps. xxv. 9, The meek he will
   guide in judgment, and the meek he will teach his way.' By the meek is
   meant a man humble, that will submit himself to God, whatever condition
   he shall appoint. This man God in his word will teach and direct.

   3. The third qualification mentioned in order to this is a constant
   dependence upon God: Prov. v. 6, Trust in the Lord with all thine
   heart, and lean not unto thine own understanding: in all thy ways
   acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.' Oh! when a man is
   brought off from this spiritual idolatry, of making his bosom to be his
   oracle, and his own heart to be his counsellor, when he doth in the
   poverty of his spirit humbly and entirely cast himself upon the help of
   God, and acknowledge him in all his ways, then he shall see a clear
   direction what God would have him to do. You have another place to this
   purpose, Ps. cxliii. 8, Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk;
   for I lift up my soul unto thee.' Oh! when a man goes every morning to
   God, and desires the direction of his Spirit, and professeth to God in
   the poverty of his own spirit that he knows not how to guide his way
   for that day, then God will teach him the way he shall walk. So Ps.
   xxv. 4, 5, Show me thy ways, O Lord; teach me thy paths.' What is his
   argument? On thee do I wait all the day.' When you live in a constant
   dependence upon God, then will the Lord undertake to direct and guide
   you.

   4. Obedience or Christian practice, that is one of the qualifications
   that make you capable for direction from the word of God: John vii. 17,
   If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine whether it
   be of God.' A man does not know whether this opinion or that be
   according to God's mind, when there are plausible pretences on every
   side. He that maketh conscience of known truth, and walketh up to his
   light, he that doth not search to satisfy curiosity, but out of a
   thorough resolution to obey and submit his neck to the yoke of Christ,
   whatever he shall find to be the way of Christ, that man shall know
   what is the way in times of controversy and doubtful uncertainty. He
   that will say, as a famous German divine, If we had six hundred necks,
   let us submit them all to the yoke of Christ; he that is resolved to
   submit to the mind of Christ, how contrary soever to his interest, to
   the prejudices and prepossessions of his own heart, he shall know the
   doctrine that is of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON XXVI.

   My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy
   word.--Ver. 25.

   THE man of God in this psalm had spoken before of the common and
   universal benefits of the word, as it agreeth to all times and
   conditions of believers; for it belongeth to all, in what state soever
   they are, to look upon it as a direction in the way to get true
   happiness, and to stir up suitable affections in their hearts. Now he
   showeth what use the word hath in each special condition, especially in
   the time of great afflictions. David did often change states, but his
   affection to the word never changeth.

   Here is--(1.) A representation of David's case; (2.) His supplication
   or petition thereupon; wherein--(1st.) The request itself; (2d.) Hie
   argument to enforce it.

   First, The representation of David's case, My soul cleaveth unto the
   lust.' The speech is metaphorical, expressing the depth of his misery,
   or the greatness of his sorrow and humiliation. (1.) The depth of his
   misery, with allusion to the case of a man overcome in battle, or
   mortally wounded, and tumbling in the dust, or to a man dead and laid
   in the earth; as Ps. xxii. 15, Thou hast brought me to the dust of
   death.' Sure we are the expression importeth the extremity of distress
   and danger, either as a man dead, or near death. (2.) The greatness of
   his sorrow and humiliation; and so the allusion is taken from a man
   prostrate and grovelling on the ground, which was their posture of
   humbling themselves before the Lord, or when any great calamity befell
   them. As when Herod Agrippa died, they put on sackcloth, and lay upon
   the earth weeping (Joseph., lib. xix. cap. 7). The same allusion is Ps.
   xliv. 25, Our soul is bowed down unto the dust, our belly cleaveth to
   the earth.' Suitably to which allusion, the Septuagint renders it
   ekollethe to? eda'phei e psuche' mou--to the pavement.

   And we read in Theodoret, that Theodosius the Emperor, when reproved by
   Ambrose for the slaughter at Thessalonica, he lay upon the ground, and
   humbly begged pardon, using these words, Adhaesit pavimento anima mea.
   The meaning is, that in his dejected condition he would lie prostrate
   at God's feet as a poor supplicant, and die there. The first point is--

   That God's children may have such great afflictions brought upon them
   that their souls may even cleave to the dust.

   These afflictions may respect their inward or outward condition.

   1. Their inward condition; and so through grief and terrors of
   conscience they are ready to drop into the grave. That trouble of mind
   is a usual exercise of God's people, see Heman's complaint, Ps.
   lxxxviii., from ver. 3 to the end of ver. 7: My soul is full of
   troubles, and my life draweth nigh unto the grave. I am counted with
   them that go down into the pit: I am as a man that hath no strength.
   Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou
   rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand. Thou hast laid
   me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deep. Thy wrath lieth hard
   upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. Selah.' It was
   in his soul, and it was in his soul by reason of the wrath of God, and
   that in such a degree of vehemency that, in his own judgment and the
   judgment of others, he could not expect to be long a man of this world,
   little differing from the dead, yea, the damned. So David, Ps. lxxvii.
   1, &c., I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice,
   and he gave ear unto me. In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord; my
   sore ran in the night and ceased not; my soul refused to be comforted.
   I remembered God, and was troubled. I complained, and my spirit was
   overwhelmed. Selah. Thou boldest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled
   that I cannot speak: I have considered the days of old, the years of
   ancient time,' &c. By the sense of God's wrath he was even wounded to
   death, and the sore running upon him would admit of no plaister; yea,
   the remembrance of God was a trouble to him: I remembered God, and was
   troubled.' What a heavy word was that! Soul troubles are the most
   pressing troubles; a child of God is as a lost man in such a condition.

   2. In respect of the heavy weight of outward pressures. Thus David
   fasted, and lay all night upon the earth in his child's sickness: 2
   Sam. xii. 16, 17, David therefore besought God for the child; and David
   fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth. And the elders
   of his house arose, and went to him to raise him up from the earth; but
   he would not: neither did he eat bread with them.' And when he was
   driven from his palace by Absalom, and was in danger of his life every
   moment (which some interpreters think to be the case intended in the
   text), when he went up the Mount of Olives barefoot, going and weeping:
   2 Sam. xv. 30, And David went up by the ascent of Mount Olivet, and
   wept as he went up, and had his head covered; and he went barefoot, and
   all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they
   went up, weeping as they went.'

   Now the reasons of this are these--

   1. To correct them for past sins. This was the cause of David's
   trouble, and this puts a sting into all miseries. God's children smart
   under their sins here in the world as well as others: Prov. xi. 31,
   Behold the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth, much more the
   wicked and the sinner.' Recompensed in the earth, that is, punished for
   his sins. Compare with it 1 Peter iv. 18, And if the righteous scarcely
   be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?' God punisheth
   here that he may spare for ever. He giveth some remembrance of the
   evil, and corrects his people, not to complete their justification, or
   to make more satisfaction for God's justice than Christ hath made, yet
   to promote their sanctification; that is, to make sin bitter to them,
   and to vindicate the glory of God, that he is not partial. For these
   reasons they are even brought to the dust by their own folly.

   2. To humble them, and bring them low in the midst of their great
   enjoyments; therefore he casts them down even to the dust. Because we
   cannot keep our hearts low, therefore God maketh our condition low.
   This was Paul's case: 2 Cor. i. 7-9, And our hope of you is stead fast,
   knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also
   of the consolation; for we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of
   our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of
   measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life; but
   we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in
   ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead'--that is, not to build
   too securely on their own sufficiencies.

   3. To try their graces, which are never tried to the life till we be
   near the point of death. The sincerity of our estate and the strength
   of faith is not discovered upon the throne so much as in the dust, if
   we can depend upon God in the hardest condition.

   4. To awaken the spirit of prayer: Out of the depths have I cried unto
   thee, O Lord,' Ps. cxxx. 1. Affliction puts an edge upon our desires.
   They that are flat and careless at other times are oftenest then with
   God.

   5. To show the more of his glory, and the riches of his goodness in
   their recovery: Ps. lxxi. 20, 21, Thou which hast showed me great and
   sore troubles, shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from
   the depths of the earth. Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort
   me on every side.' By the greater humiliation, God prepareth us for the
   greater blessings. As there are multitudes of troubles to humble and
   try the saints, so his mercies do not come alone, but with great
   plenty.

   Use 1. Let us bless God that we are not put to such great trials. How
   gentle is our exercise compared with David's case! We are weak, and God
   will not overburden us. There is a great deal of the wisdom and love of
   God seen in the measure of the cross, and in the nature and kind of it.
   We have no cause to say our belly cleaveth to the dust, or that we are
   pressed above measure. God giveth us only a gentle remembrance. If
   brought upon our knees, we are not brought upon our faces.

   2. If this should be our case, do not count it strange. It is a usual
   exercise of God's people; let us therefore not be offended, but ap
   prove God's holy and wise dispensation. If there be great troubles,
   there have been great sins, or there will be great comforts, or for the
   present there are great graces. As such a dispensation is a correction,
   there is reason to approve it. If you be laid in the dust, have you not
   laid God's honour in the dust, and trampled his laws under foot? As it
   is a trial, you have cause to approve it; for it is but meet that when
   God hath planted grace in the heart, he should prove the strength of
   it. Therefore, if you be kept so long in your heavy condition that you
   seem dead, yet if you have faith to keep you alive, and patience be
   exercised, it is for your greater good: Rom. v. 3, And not only so, but
   we glory in tribulation, knowing that tribulation worketh patience;'
   and as affliction is an exercise for your benefit and spiritual
   improvement. The husbandman, when he teareth and rendeth the ground up
   with the plough, it is to make it more fruitful. The longer the metal
   is in the fire the more pure it cometh forth. Nay, sometimes you have
   your outward comforts with advantage after trouble: as Job xlii. 10-12,
   And the Lord turned the captivity of Job when he prayed for his
   friends: also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before; and the
   Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning.' Oh! when
   we are fitted to enjoy comforts we shall have them plenty enough.

   Second point, That in such great and heavy troubles we should deal with
   God for help.

   In the dust David calleth to God for quickening. The reasons of this,
   why in great troubles we should go to God for help, are--

   1. From the inconvenience of any other course.

   [1.] If the godly should smother their grief, and not go to God with
   it, their sorrow were able to choke them. It is no small ease that we
   have a God to go to, to whom we may freely open our minds. Prayer hath
   a pacative virtue; as Hannah, 1 Sam. i. 18, prayed unto the Lord, and
   wept sore;' and mark the event, The woman went her way, and did eat,
   and her countenance was no more sad,' &c. An oven stopped up is the
   hotter within, but vent and utterance giveth ease to the heart, if it
   be merely by way of complaint to a friend, without expectation of
   relief; much more to go to God, and lay open our case before him.

   [2.] To seek our comfort elsewhere, from earthly things, it is a vain
   and evil course. (1.) It is vain; for God is the party with whom we
   have to do. In many troubles the creatures may be instruments of our
   woe; but the principal party is God. Strike in with him, and you stop
   the mischief at the head: Prov. xvi. 7, When a man's ways please the
   Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.' In other
   troubles God hath a more immediate hand, as sickness and terrors of
   conscience; our business then lieth not with the creatures; in
   sickness, not with physicians first, but with God. In troubles of
   spirit we are not to quench our thirst at the next ditch, but to run to
   the fountain of living water; not to take up with ordinary comforts;
   that is an attempt to break prison, and to get out of the troubles be
   fore God letteth us out. He is our party then, whoever be the
   instrument. (2.) It is evil that we refuse to come to God when he
   whippeth us into his presence, and beateth us to the throne of grace:
   Dan. ix. 13, All this evil is come upon us, yet made we not our prayer
   be fore the Lord our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and
   understand thy truth.' When men are ready to die, and will not so much
   as confer with the physician, they are either stupid or desperate.
   Afflictions summon us into his presence. God sendeth a tempest after
   us, as after Jonah. Now that trouble which chaseth us to God is so far
   a sanctified trouble.

   2. The hope of relief from God, who alone can and will help us. He put
   his mouth in the dust; peradventure there is hope,' Lam. iii. 29. Now
   this hope is from God's power and will.

   [1.] His power. God can quicken us when we are as good as dead, because
   he is the well-spring of life and comfort. Other things give us life,
   but as water scaldeth when it is the instrument of heat; but God alone
   can help us. God is the great quickener: That I might trust in him that
   raiseth the dead;' and I am the resurrection and the life.'

   [2.] His will. When we are humble and tractable in our afflictions--

   (1.) It is some hope if we have nothing to bring before God but our
   grief and misery, for he is pitiful. A beggar will uncover his sore to
   move your bowels. So many times all the reason that a poor pitiful
   afflicted person can bring for himself is lamenting his case to God,
   how discouraged he is, and apt to faint, as David represents his case,
   My soul cleaveth to the dust;' and elsewhere, Ps. lxix. 29, But I am
   poor and sorrowful; let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high,'
   Justice seeketh a fit object, but mercy a fit occasion.

   (2.) It is a greater ground of hope when we are humbled under God's
   hand, and have a due sense of our condition; that is, are convinced of
   our emptiness, weakness, nothingness, or emptied of self-conceit and
   carnal confidence: Deut. xxxii. 36, For the Lord shall judge his
   people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their
   power is gone, and there is none shut up or left.' God's judgments are
   to break our carnal dependencies.

   (3.) Still the hope increaseth when we acknowledge his justice and
   wisdom in all our troubles: Lev. xxvi. 41, If then their uncircumcised
   hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their
   iniquity,' kiss the rod wherewith they are corrected, be glad it is no
   worse, and see that all this cometh from a just and wise God.

   (4.) There is further hope when we can cast ourselves upon his
   faithfulness and omnipotency, in the face of all discouragements.
   Christ's question to the man long possessed was, Mark ix. 23, If thou
   canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.' God's
   power is exercised when glorified by faith and dependence.

   (5.) When we submit to what may be most for his glory. Carnal prayers,
   though never so earnest, fail when we are too earnest upon our private
   end, and the means which we fancy: Ps. cxv. 1, Not unto us, O Lord, not
   unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy and for thy
   truth's sake.'

   Use. In deep calamities run to God, lay forth your case feelingly and
   with submission to the justice of his providence, trusting to his
   power, and submitting to his wisdom, without obtruding your model upon
   God, but leaving him to his own course; and this is the way to speed.
   Take heed--

   1. Of a stupid carelessness under the rod. It is a time of seeking
   after God, a summons to the creature to come before him. Now, if we
   think to sport away our trouble without looking after God's comforts,
   it is a desperate security: Jer. v. 12, They have belied the Lord, and
   said, It is not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we
   see sword nor famine.'

   2. Take heed of despondency. The throne of grace is set up on purpose
   for such a time: Heb. iv. 16, Let us therefore come boldly to the
   throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in
   time of need;' Ps. 1. 15, Call upon me in the day of trouble; I will
   deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.' Open your case before the
   Lord.

   3. Take heed of pitching too much upon outward things, either as to the
   time or way of deliverance. Lust is vehement; but the more you seek,
   the more comfortable will be the issue: Ps. li. 18, Do good in thy good
   pleasure unto Sion; build thou the walls of thy Jerusalem.'

   Secondly, We come now to David's supplication or petition there upon;
   where observe--

   1. The request itself, quicken thou me.

   2. The argument, according to thy word.

   First, The request itself, Quicken thou me;' which noteth either the
   renewing of comfort or the actuation of graces, the restoring or
   putting life into his affairs.

   1. The renewing of comfort; quicken me, revive me, or restore life to
   me again; and this either by outward deliverance--so quickening is used
   Ps. lxxi. 20, Thou which hast showed me great and sore troubles, shalt
   quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the
   earth,' where deep trouble is compared to the grave, and deliverance a
   kind of resurrection or recovery from the dead or by the letting in of
   inward comfort and spiritual reviving from the sense of God's love; so
   Ps. lxxx. 18, 19, Quicken us, and we will call upon thy name. Turn us
   again, O Lord God of hosts; cause thy face to shine, and we shall be
   saved.' The shining of God's face, or the sense of God's love, is the
   reviving of afflicted spirits.

   2. The actuation of grace; there may be life where there is no vigour.
   Now when we are stirred up to be lively in God's service, we are said
   to be quickened, as in the 19th verse of the psalm before quoted; and
   often it is thus used in this psalm, as ver. 37, Quicken thou me in thy
   way.' The point is this--

   That God's children need often to go to God for quickening, because
   they often lie under deadness of heart, and therefore should desire
   God, who is the fountain of grace, to emit and send forth his
   influence.

   They need this quickening--(1.) By reason of their constant weakness;
   (2.) Their frequent indispositions and distempers of soul.

   1. Their constant weakness in this world.

   [1.] By reason of their inclination to sin.

   [2.] The imperfection of their motions towards that which is good.

   [1.] By reason of their inclination to sin. Carnal concupiscence
   draweth us aside from God to sensual objects: James i. 14, A man is
   drawn away by his own lust.' There is a strong bias of corruption
   drawing us from Christ to present things: Heb. xii. 1, Let us lay aside
   every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us.' There is a
   carnal affection or corrupt inclination which carrieth us out
   inordinately to things lawful, or too often to things unlawful; this
   hangeth as a weight, retarding us in all our heavenly flights and
   motions. The love and care of the world, which is apt to press down the
   soul, and doth twine about us, and insinuate with us; the apostle
   calleth it a law in his members.' Rom. vii. 23, a warning to us how,
   when the flesh draweth us off so strongly one way, to implore the
   divine grace to draw us more strongly to the other.

   [2.] Because of the imperfection of their motions to that which is
   good, though there be a purpose, bent of heart, and inclination that
   way. Our gyves are still about us; we feel the old maim. Grace is like
   a spark in wet wood, that needs continual blowing.

   2. Their frequent indispositions and distempers of soul. Some times
   they feel a loathness in their souls and a shyness of God's presence;
   their hearts hang off; the spirit indeed is willing, but some fleshly
   thought or carnal excuse checketh the motion. It is God alone that can
   make the soul willing; he giveth both will and deed. God bendeth the
   unwilling will, as well as helpeth the fainting affections. Again,
   sometimes they find a great deadness; there is no vigour or liveliness
   in their affections, and they cannot follow after God with such zeal
   and earnestness: though there be not a formal deadness, such as usually
   is in the duties of hypocrites, yet there is not always the same
   strength and agility of grace in the children of God; their souls do
   not so earnestly reach after Christ. Now, what can help but divine
   quickening? Therefore go to God for it. We should rouse and stir up
   ourselves. God giveth out influences according to his will or pleasure,
   but we must still stir up ourselves.

   But to answer a case of conscience, whether we are to do duty in case
   of deadness and indisposition, &c.?

   1. The influence of grace is not the warrant of duty, but the help; it
   is the efficient assisting cause, not the ground or rule. We are to do
   all acts of obedience on account of God's command: Luke v. 5, Simon
   answering, said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night;
   nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net.' God is sovereign,
   and we are bound to obey, whether disposed or indisposed. Should the
   husbandman never plough but when disposed to plough?

   2. Our sinful indisposition cannot excuse us. In sins of commission,
   our weakness to resist temptation is no excuse. So also in sins of
   omission, we cannot be allowed to say, It was the Lord suffered me to
   sin. No more will this plea be allowed, The Lord did not quicken me to
   duty. Grace is as necessary to prevent sin as to perform duty. God's
   suspension was no excuse to Hezekiah: 2 Chron. xxxii. 31; Howbeit in
   the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent to
   him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him,
   to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.' This
   complaint of weakness hath an ill aspect; complaining without labouring
   is rather a taxing of God. But--

   3. Natural men are bound to pray and perform duties, therefore renewed
   men. That natural men are bound, see Acts viii. 22, Repent therefore of
   this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine
   heart may be forgiven thee;' and Ps. xiv. 2, The Lord looked down from
   heaven to see if there were any that did understand and seek God.' It
   is charged as a crime that they did not, but much more the renewed; for
   to whom more is given, of them more is required. It is another talent
   wherewith they are intrusted. Grace is not only donum, but talentum;
   grace is not given as a piece of money to a child to play withal, but
   as we give money to factors to trade withal for us. Now a renewed man
   should do more, being capable of more.

   4. The outward act of a duty is commanded as well as the inward; though
   they come not up to the nature of a perfect duty, there is some what of
   the ordinance of Christ in them: Hosea xiv. 2, Take with you words, and
   turn unto the Lord: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive
   us graciously; so will we render the calves of our lips.' Though I
   cannot do all, I must do as much as I can.

   5. We are to wait humbly in the use of means for the power of his
   grace. When the door is shut, knocking is the only way to get it open.
   I will go and offer myself to God, and see what he will do for me;
   which is God's usual way, and to be used with the more caution and
   diligence, because God doth all: Phil. ii. 12, 13, Wherefore, my be
   loved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now
   much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and
   trembling: for it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of
   his good pleasure.' Seamen by tacking about get wind: so far as you use
   the means, you comply with God's end. A sad threatening there is to
   those that neglect the use of means, that shut the door upon
   themselves, or if God withdraws, are willing he should keep away.

   6. Acting in spiritual duties fits us for them. Iter ad pietatem est
   intra pietatem--praying fits for praying, meditating for meditating.
   Frequent turning the key maketh the lock go more easy. Good
   dispositions make way for good dispositions, Ps. xxvii. 14; Ps. xxxi.
   24, Wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thy
   heart.' Pluck up your spirits, strive to take courage, and then God
   will give you courage. To shake us out of laziness, God maketh the
   precept go before the promise. God biddeth us pray, though prayer be
   his own gift. Act as you would expect.

   7. There is a supply cometh in ere we are aware: Cant. vi. 12, Or ever
   I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib,' in the
   very work, A strange difference of temper is to be ob served in David
   before the psalm be over: 1 Chron. xxii. 16, Arise, therefore, and be
   doing, and the Lord be with thee.' God will not help that man that hath
   legs to go, and will not.

   8. We are to rouse up ourselves: Isa., lxiv. 7, And there is none that
   calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee.'
   When we are willing to get the work over, and wrestle not for life and
   power in praying, we do not all we are able. The cock by clapping the
   wings addeth strength to the crowing. We should rouse up ourselves. We
   use not the bellows to a dead coal, &c.

   Secondly, The next circumstance is the argument, According to thy
   word.' What word doth David mean? Either the general promises in the
   books of Moses or Job, which intimate deliverance to the faithful
   observers of God's law, or help to the miserable and distressed, or
   some particular promise given to him by Nathan or others. Chrysostom
   saith, Quicken me to live according to thy word: but it is not a word
   of command, but a word of promise. Mark here--

   1. He doth not say, Secundum meritum meum, but secundum verbum tuum;
   the hope, or that help which we expect from God, is founded upon his
   word; there is our security, in his promises, not in our
   deservings--Promittendo se fecit debitorem, &c.

   2. When there was so little scripture written, yet David could find out
   a word for his support. Alas! in our troubles and afflictions no
   promise occurreth to mind. As in outward things, many that have less
   live better than those that have abundance; so here. Now scripture is
   so large, we are less diligent, and therefore, though we have so many
   promises, we are apt to faint, we have not a word to bear us up.

   3. This word did not help him till he had lain long under this heavy
   condition, so that he seemed dead. Many when they have a promise, think
   presently to enjoy the comfort of it. No; there is waiting and striving
   first necessary. We never relish the comfort of the promises till the
   creatures have spent their allowance, and we have been exercised. God
   will keep his word, and yet we must expect to be tried.

   4. In this his dead condition, faith in God's word kept him alive. When
   we have lost feeling, and there is nothing left us, the word will
   support us: Rom. iv. 19, 20, And being not weak in faith, he considered
   not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old,
   neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb; he staggered not at the
   promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving glory
   to God.'

   5. One good way to get comfort is to plead the promise to God in
   prayer. Chirographa tua injiciebat tibi, Domine. Show him his
   handwriting; God is tender of his word. These arguings in prayer are
   not to work upon God, but ourselves.

   Use. Well, then, let us thus deal with God, looking to him in the sense
   of our own weakness, praying often to God for quickening, as David doth
   in the text. God keepeth grace in his own hands, and dispenseth it at
   his pleasure, that he may often hear from us, and that we may renew our
   dependence upon him. It is pleasing to him when we desire him to renew
   his work, and bring forth the actings of grace in their vigour and
   lustre. And let us acknowledge divine grace if there be strong actings
   of faith and love towards God. He is to be owned in his work.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON XXVII.

   I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me; teach me thy
   statutes.--Ver. 26.

   IN this verse you have three things:--

   1. David's open and free dealing with God, I have declared my ways.

   2. God's gracious dealing with David, and thou heardest me.

   3. A petition for continuance of the like favour teach me thy statutes.

   First, For the first, I have declared my ways;' that is, distinctly and
   without hypocrisy laid open the state of my heart and course of my
   affairs to thee, note--

   Doct. They that would speed with God should learn this point of
   Christian ingenuity, unfeignedly to lay open their whole case to him;
   that is, to declare what they are about, the nature of their affairs,
   the^ state of their hearts, what of good or evil they find in
   themselves, their conflicts, supplies, distresses, hopes; that is
   declaring our ways; the good and evil we are conscious to. As a sick
   patient will tell the physician how it is with him, so should we deal
   with God if we would find mercy. This declaring his ways may be looked
   upon--

   1. As an act of faith and dependence.

   2. As an act of holy friendship.

   3. As an act of spiritual contrition and brokenness of heart; for this
   declaring must be explained according to the sense of the object of
   what David means by this expression, My ways.'

   First, His businesses or undertakings; I have still made them known to
   thee, committing them to the direction of thy providence; and so it is
   an act of faith and dependence, consulting with God, and acquainting
   him with all our desires. This is necessary--

   1. That we may acknowledge the sovereignty of his providence and
   dominion over all events: Prov. xvi. 9, A man's heart deviseth his way,
   but the Lord directeth his steps.' Man proposeth, but God disposeth,
   and carrieth on the event either further than we intended, or else
   contrary to what we intended.

   2. We must declare our ways to God that we may take God along with us
   in all our actions, that we may ask his leave, counsel, blessing: Prov.
   iii. 6, In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy
   paths.' There is a twofold direction, one of God's providence, the
   other of his counsel. The direction of his providence, that is
   understood: Prov. xvi. 9, A man's heart deviseth his way, but the Lord
   directeth his steps.' But then there is the direction of his counsel,
   and the latter is promised here; if we acknowledge God and declare our
   ways to him, God will counsel us. And David did thus declare his way
   upon all occasions: 2 Sam. ii. 1, David inquired of the Lord, saying,
   Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?' It is a piece of
   religious manners to begin every business with God; to go to God, Lord,
   shall I do so, or shall I not? to desire him that is Lord of all to
   give us leave; who is the fountain of wisdom, to give us counsel; and
   the disposer of all events, to give us a blessing.

   3. The declaring of our ways is necessary, that we may be sensible of
   God's eye that is upon us, and so act the more sincerely. Certainly it
   is a great advantage to make God conscious to every business we have in
   hand, when we dare undertake nothing but what we would acquaint him
   withal. There are some to whom the prophet pronounceth a woe: Isa.
   xxix. 15, Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the
   Lord, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? and
   who knoweth us?' For the opening of this place, surely none can
   seriously be so vain, and grow up to such sottish atheism, as to think
   to hide a thing from God; but they are loath solemnly to draw it forth
   in the view of conscience, to revive a sense of God's omnisciency upon
   themselves. We are said to deny that which many times we forget and
   will not think of. So that those which hide their counsels from God are
   those that will not take God along with them. In short, this
   declaration is not necessary for God, who knows our thoughts afar off,'
   Ps. cxxxix. 2; not only our words and works, but purposes, before we
   begin to lift up a thought that way. But this declaration is necessary
   for us, to increase the awe of God upon our heart, and that we may
   undertake nothing but what we will solemnly acquaint the Lord with.
   Well, then, this declaring our ways is an act of dependence.

   Secondly, By his ways may be meant all his straits, sorrows, and
   dangers; and so this declaring it is an act of holy friendship, when a
   man comes as one friend to another, and acquaints God with his whole
   state, lays his condition before the Lord, in hope of pity and relief.
   We have liberty to do so, to tell God all our mind: Heb. x. 19, Let us
   come with boldness, by the blood of Jesus;' and Heb. iv. 16. The word
   signifies, with liberty of speech, speaking all to God, your whole
   state and condition; if you have any sins to be pardoned, any miseries
   to be redressed; that where you are doubtful, you may be helped by
   God's counsel, where you are weak, you may be confirmed by his
   strength, where you are sinful, you may be pitied by his mercy, where
   you are miserable, you may be delivered by his power. This is holy
   friendship, to acquaint God with our doubts, wants, griefs, and fears;
   and we may do it with more confidence, because we go to him in Christ's
   name: John xvi. 23, Whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name, it
   shall be granted unto you.' It is no fiction or strain, but a real
   truth. Will Christ deceive us when he saith, Verily? And then
   whatsoever you ask? You have liberty to go to God for the removal of
   any fear, the granting any regular desire, or for satisfying any doubt:
   Whatsoever you ask the Father in my name.' Our prayers by this means
   are Christ's request as well as ours. For instance, if you send a child
   or servant to a friend for anything in your name, the request is yours,
   and he that denies a child or servant denies you; so saith Christ, Go
   to the Father in my name. God cannot deny a request in Christ's name,
   no more than he can deny Christ himself; therefore you may use a holy
   boldness.

   Thirdly, By ways is meant temptations and sins; and so this declaring
   is an act of spiritual contrition or brokenness of heart. Sins, they
   are properly our ways; as Ezek. xviii. 25, the Lord makes a distinction
   between my ways and your ways. God hath his ways, and we ours. Our ways
   are properly our sins. Now these, saith David, I will declare, that is,
   distinctly lay them open before God. This is a part of our duty, with
   brokenness of heart to declare our ways, to acquaint God fully how it
   is with us, without dissembling anything. It is a duty very unpleasing
   to flesh and blood; natural pride and self-love will not let us take
   shame upon ourselves; and out of carnal ease and laziness we are loath
   to submit to such a troublesome course, and thus openly to declare our
   ways. Guilt is shy of God's presence, and sin works a strangeness. Adam
   hid himself when God came into the garden; and when he could shift no
   longer, he will not declare it, but transfers the fault upon Eve, and
   obliquely upon God himself; and ever since there are many
   tergiversations in man's heart; and therefore it is said, Job xxxi. 33,
   If I have covered my sin as did Adam.' Junius renders it more
   hominum--after the manner of men; but Adam's name is used because we
   show ourselves to be right Adam's race, apt to cover our sins. The same
   expression we have Hosea vi. 7, But they like men have transgressed the
   covenant.' In the Hebrew it is, like Adam; so, if I covered my sin as
   did Adam, this is the fashion of men. Now, David brought his heart to
   this resolution with much struggling: Ps. xxxii. 5, I said, I will
   confess my sins;' he forced himself, and thrust his backward heart
   forward by a strong resolution; for we are loath to deal thus openly,
   plainly, and truly with God, being shy of his presence, and would fain
   keep the devil's counsel, and come with our iniquity in our bosom. But
   though this is a troublesome displeasing exercise to flesh and blood,
   yet it is profitable and necessary for us thus to declare our ways.

   1. Because it is made to be one of the conditions of pardon, and the
   act of repentance that is necessary to the pardon of sin: Prov. xxviii.
   13, He that hideth his sins shall not prosper; but he that confesseth
   and forsakes them, shall find mercy;' so it runs. And 1 John i. 9, If
   we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins.'
   God's justice is satisfied by Christ, but it must be glorified and
   owned by us. So Jer. iii. 13, I am merciful, saith the Lord: only
   acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the
   Lord thy God.' God hath mercy enough to pardon all, only he will have
   it sued out his own way, he will have his mercy asked upon our knees;
   and have the creature stoop and submit. And David, Ps. li. 3, I
   acknowledge my transgression.'

   2. It is the only means to have our peace settled. If you would not
   have your trouble and anxious thoughts continued upon you, go open
   yourselves to God, declare your ways: Ps. xxxii. 5, I said, I will
   confess my transgressions unto the Lord, and thou forgavest the
   iniquity of my sin.' As soon as David did but take up a resolution,
   presently he felt the comfort of it. If David had confessed sooner, he
   had come to his ease sooner. Distress of conscience is continued upon
   us until this be done; and especially is this found by experience, when
   great trouble comes upon us by reason of sin. There is some sin at the
   bottom God will bring out; and until they come to clearness and
   openness with God, the Lord still continues the trouble; they are kept
   roaring, and do not come to their peace, Job xxxiii. 26, 27. When a man
   is under trouble, and the sense of sin doth not fasten on the heart, he
   is not prepared for deliverance; but when it comes to this, I have
   sinned, and it profits me not,' then God sends an interpreter, one
   among a thousand, to show unto man his uprightness.'

   3. It prevents Satan's accusations and God's judgments. It is no profit
   to cover our sins, for either Satan will declare them, or God find us
   out, and enter into judgment with us. It prevents Satan as an accuser
   and God as a judge.

   [1.] It prevents Satan as an accuser. Let us not tarry till our
   adversary accuse. There is one that will accuse you if you do not
   accuse yourselves. He that is a tempter is also an accuser of the
   brethren. Now confession puts Satan out of office. When we have sued
   out our pardon, Satan is not an accuser so much as a slanderer: Rom.
   viii. 33, Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?' The
   informer comes too late when the guilty person hath accused himself,
   and sued out his pardon. And--

   [2.] It prevents God as a judge. It is all known to God: Ps. lxix. 5, O
   God! thou knowest my foolishness, and my sins are not hid from thee.'
   It is a folly to conceal that which cannot be hid. God knows them. How?
   God may be said to know things two ways--either simply with respect to
   the perfection of his nature, and so he knows all things; or by virtue
   of his office, and so God knows things judicially as judge of the
   world; he takes knowledge of it so as to punish it, unless you confess
   it. But in this kind of knowledge he loves to be prevented; he will not
   know it as a judge if we confess it, when there is process against sin
   in our own consciences: 1 Cor. xi. 31, If we judge ourselves we shall
   not be judged.' When we accuse and judge ourselves, then God's work is
   prevented. God is contented if we will accuse, arraign, judge, and
   condemn ourselves; then he will not take knowledge of our sins as a
   judge. The end of God's judging is execution and punishment, but the
   end of our judging is that we may obtain pardon. Now, consider whether
   you will stand at the bar of Christ, not as a Saviour, but as a judge;
   or will judge yourselves in your own heart? Better sit as judge upon
   your own heart than God should sit as judge upon you; therefore deal
   plainly and openly with him.

   Thus I have explained what it is to declare our ways; it is an act of
   dependence to take God's leave, blessing, counsel along with us; an act
   of friendship, as to lay open our case to God; and an act of brokenness
   of heart, as declaring our sins and temptations.

   For the reasons why, if we would speed with God, we should unfeignedly
   lay open our case before him.

   1. It argueth sincerity. A hypocrite will pray, but will not thus
   sincerely open his heart to God: Ps. xxxii. 1 Blessed is he in whose
   spirit there is no guile.' No guile; it hath a limited sense with
   respect to the matter of confession, that doth not deal deceitfully
   with God, but plainly and openly declares his case. Many ways men may
   be guilty of guile of spirit in confession of sin; either when they
   content themselves with general or slight acknowledgments; as thus, We
   are all sinners; but they do not declare their ways. Generals are but
   notions; and as particular persons are lost in a crowd, so sins lie hid
   in common acknowledgments. Or else men take up the empty forms of
   others. You shall see in Numbers xix. the waters of purification
   wherewith a man had been cleansed, if another touched them, he became
   unclean. Confessions are like those waters whereby one hath cleansed
   himself. Now to take up others' confessions, and the forms of others,
   without the same affection, feeling, and brokenness of heart, doth but
   defile us the more, when the heart doth not prescribe to the tongue but
   the tongue to the heart. Or else men make some acknowledgments to God,
   but do not uncover their privy sore; they are loath to draw forth the
   state of their hearts into the notice and view of conscience. This
   guile of spirit may be sometimes in God's children. Moses had a privy
   sore which he was loath to disclose; and therefore when God would have
   sent him into Egypt, he pleads other things, insufficiency, want of
   elocution, that he was a stammerer, that he had not utterance. Ay! but
   his carnal fear was the main; therefore see how God touches his privy
   sore: Exod. iv. 19, Arise, Moses; go into Egypt: the men that sought
   thy life are dead.' Why, Moses never pleaded that; he mentions other
   things that were true, that he was a man of slow speech, and his
   brother Aaron was fitter; but he never pleads carnal fear: but the Lord
   knew what was at the bottom. So it is with Christians; many times we
   will confess this and that which is a truth, and we may humble
   ourselves for it. Ay! but there is a privy sore yet kept secret.
   Therefore this open dealing with God is very necessary to lay open
   before God whatever we know of our state and way, for then God will be
   nigh to us. Out of self-love men spare themselves, and will not judge
   and condemn themselves; therefore they deny, excuse, extenuate, or
   hypocritically confess, Oh, I am a sinner! and the like, but do not
   come openly.

   2. It argueth somewhat of the spirit of adoption to put in the bill of
   our complaint to our heavenly father, to draw up an indictment against
   ourselves. To judge, that is irksome; but to put in a bill of complaint
   to a friend, or father, that savours of more ingenuity. To tell God all
   our mind notes freedom and familiarity; not such as is bold, rude, nor
   a dress of words; but such as is grave, serious, proceeding from an
   inward sense of God, and hope of his mercy: 1 John iii. 21, If our
   hearts condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God;' then we
   can deal with him as one friend with another, and acquaint him with all
   our griefs and wants. A man had need walk exactly that would maintain
   his freedom with God. There is a freedom, as men may call it, such as
   is bold, rude, and reckless, in words only; but that which proceeds
   from confidence in God and his mercy, that is a fruit of close walking;
   we cannot have it in our hearts without it.

   3. It is the way to make us serious and affected with our condition.
   When we open our whole heart to God, then we shall be more earnest for
   a remedy; we content ourselves with some transient glances, and
   imperfect knowledge of our estate, and so are not affected as we
   should; a particular view of things most works with us. Look, as
   Christ, the more particularly he is set forth, the more taking is the
   object; when the lump of sweetness is dissolved, then it is tasted. The
   more particularly we pry into our estate, the more we are affected, and
   the more we shall see of the deceitfulness of our own hearts: When
   every one shall know his own sore and grief,' 2 Chron. vi. 29.

   4. It will be of great advantage in the spiritual life to declare often
   our whole estate to God; for the more men know themselves the more they
   mind God and their heavenly calling. Those men that make conscience of
   declaring themselves to God will ever find lusts to be mortified,
   doubts to be resolved, graces to be strengthened. A man that doth not
   look after his estate, it runs into decay insensibly before he is
   aware; so when men grow negligent of their hearts, and never think of
   giving an account to God, all runs to waste in the soul. Searching and
   self-examining Christians will be the most serious Christians; for as
   they have a more distinct affective sense of their condition, so they
   always find more work to do in the spiritual life. They come to know
   what are their sins, and assaults, and conflicts, and what further
   strength they may have in the way of holiness; and by this account they
   are engaged to walk more exactly, that they may not provide matter
   against themselves: 1 Peter iii. 7, That their prayers be not
   hindered;' that they may look God in the face with more confidence.

   Use 1. Let us clearly and openly declare our condition to the Lord, our
   griefs and sorrows, and so our sins.

   1. Our griefs and sorrows. Two things will quicken you to this:--The
   inconvenience of any other way. What will you do? If you swallow your
   griefs, that will oppress the heart. The more we unbosom ourselves to a
   friend, the more we find ease; vent and utterance doth lessen our
   passion. An oven stopped up is hotter within. So the more close we are,
   the more we keep our own counsel, the greater is our burden. Look, as
   wind when it is imprisoned in the caverns of the earth causeth violent
   convulsions and earthquakes, but if it find vent all is quiet, so it is
   with the heart; when troubles are kept close, then they become the
   greater burden, they make the heart stormy, full of discontent; but
   when we open ourselves, as Hannah did her case to God, 1 Sam. i. 8, we
   are no more sad; or if we go to anything on this side God, our troubles
   increase. When a man hath sorrow upon his heart, it is not the next
   ditch will yield him refreshing and comfort, but he must go to the
   fountain of living water. If we be afraid of an enemy without, our
   business is to strike in with God: Prov. xvi. 7, When a man's ways
   please the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.'
   God hath the command of all things; he is first to be treated with,
   then there is hope and relief in God. When we are humble and tractable
   in our affliction, when we come and represent our case to him, the very
   thing gives us some hope; for the Lord doth all out of mercy. Therefore
   the very representing our misery, as David: Ps. lxix. 29, But I am poor
   and sorrowful;' that we are in a miserable forlorn condition; if you
   have nothing else to plead, this is that which moves God, and works
   upon his bowels. Look, as beggars to move pity will uncover their sore,
   that as it were by a silent oratory they may extort and draw forth
   relief from you; so go to the Lord and acquaint him with your
   condition; some hope will arise hence. Lord, I am weak and poor,
   deliver me; that is all the argument.

   2. As to sins, let me tell you, go to God with clearness and openness;
   reveal your whole state, tell him what are your temptations and
   conflicts, and how your heart works. Though he knows it already by his
   own omnisciency, yet let him know it by your own acknowledgments. Let
   him not know it as a judge, take notice of it so as to punish you; but
   go deal plainly, and confess your sins. To this end--

   [1.] There will be need of light, that you may be able to judge of
   things: Heb. v. 14, They have their senses exercised to discern both
   good and evil.' When a man hath not only a speculative knowledge, but
   hath his senses exercised, able to judge of the workings of his own
   heart, he can discern what is of flesh and what is of spirit, and so
   can give an account to God. When we have not only some naked theory, we
   shall be able to see what is a temptation, where our help, and where
   our weakness lies.

   [2.] There needs observation of the workings of our own hearts. A man
   that would give an account to God need to observe himself narrowly, and
   keep his heart above all keepings. David, that saith here, I declared
   my ways, saith elsewhere, I considered my ways. It is but a formal
   account we can give without serious consideration; we must therefore
   keep our hearts with all diligence,' Prov. iv. 23.

   [3.] There needs in many cases a serious search. For instance, in. deep
   desertion, when God withdraws the light of his countenance, and men
   have not those wonted influences of grace, those glimpses of favour,
   and quickenings of spirit, and enlargings of heart: Ps. lxxvii. 6, I
   call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own
   heart, and my spirit made diligent search.' When under any despair of
   soul, trace it to its original cause: Wherein have I grieved the Spirit
   of God? So Lam. iii. 40, Let us search and try our ways.' There needs a
   very distinct and serious inquiry into the state of our souls, that we
   may deal ingenuously with God, and lay open ourselves before him.

   Secondly, The second clause, and the Lord heard me.

   Doct. After an ingenuous and open declaration of ourselves to God, we
   find audience with him.

   So did David, and so do all the saints. He was never yet wanting to his
   people that deals sincerely with him in prayer. How doth God manifest
   his audience? Either inwardly by the Spirit, or outwardly by
   providence.

   First, Inwardly by his Spirit, when he begets a persuasion of their
   acceptance with God, leaves an impression of confidence upon their
   hearts, and a quietness in looking for the thing they had asked. Before
   they have an answer of providence, they have a persuasion of heart that
   their prayer hath been accepted. There is a great deal of difference
   between accepting a prayer and granting a prayer. God's acceptance is
   as soon as we pray, but the thing we beg for is another thing and
   distinct: 1 John v. 14, 15, This is the confidence that we have in him,
   that if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us; and if we
   know that he hear us whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the
   petitions that we desired of him.' God's hearing of us, his audience,
   is a distinct thing from the answer of his providence; and therefore
   when he begets a confidence that we are heard, and the soul begins to
   be quieted in God and look up for mercy, it is a sign of his accepting
   our prayer, though the benefit be not actually bestowed. David found a
   change in his heart many times, as if one had come and told him the
   posture of his affairs was altered. It is otherwise with you than it
   was when you began to pray; therefore you have him in the beginning of
   a psalm come in with bitter complaints and groaning; his eyes were
   ready to drop out with grief, and presently he breaks out with
   thanksgiving, as Ps. vi. 8, 9, Mine eye is consumed because of grief;
   it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.' Presently, Depart from me
   all ye workers of iniquity, for the Lord hath heard the voice of my
   weeping.' So Hannah, she had commended her request to God, and was no
   more sad, 1 Sam. i. 16. That is one way of answer; when we have
   declared ourselves to the Lord, the heart looks out to see what will
   come of its prayers; it begins to rest, and is quiet in God, and looks
   for some answer of the mercy.

   The second consideration, that the outward mercy in his providence is
   either in kind or in value. God doth not always answer us in kind, by
   giving us the thing asked; but doth give us something that is as good
   or better, which contents the heart, by denying the thing desired, and
   giving something equivalent. Many times we ask temporal mercies,
   defence, victory, deliverance, and God gives spiritual; we ask
   deliverance and God gives patience, 2 Cor. xii. 8, 9. Paul asked thrice
   that the thorn in the flesh might depart from him; but God gives him
   sufficient grace. God doth not answer us always according to our will,
   but certainly according to our weal and profit. Many times he will give
   the blessing in kind, but at other times he gives the value of it,
   which is better. God may give temporal comfort in kind, in anger; but
   the value, the blessing, he never gives in anger, but always in love.
   When they asked meat for their lusts, God gave it in kind, in anger,
   Ps. lxxviii.: And I gave them a king in my wrath,' Hosea xiii. 11. When
   we are passionate and eager upon a temporal request, God doth answer in
   wrath; the mercy is more when he gives us that which is better.

   Thirdly, God delays many times when he doth not deny, for our exercise.

   1. To exercise our faith, to see if we can believe in him when we see
   nothing, have no sensible proof of his good-will to us. The woman of
   Canaan she comes to Christ, and first gets not a word from him--Christ
   answered her nothing;' afterwards Christ breaks off his silence, and
   begins to speak, and his speech was more discouraging than his silence.
   She meets with a rough answer: It is not meet to give the children's
   bread unto dogs.' Then the woman turns this rebuke into an
   encouragement, Lord, the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their
   master's table.' Then Christ could hold no longer: O woman! great is
   thy faith; be it unto thee even as thou wilt,' Mat. xv. So many times
   we come to God and meet with a silent oracle, cannot get an answer; but
   if we get an answer, it may be we begin to think God puts us off, as
   none of the sheep he is to look after. Oh! but when we wrestle through
   all these discouragements and temptations, then great is thy faith.' In
   short, we pray for a blessing; and sometimes, though God love the
   suppliant, yet he doth not seem to take notice of his desires, that he
   may humble him to the dust, and may have a sense of his unworthiness,
   and pick an answer out of God's silence, and grant out of his denial,
   and faith out of these discouragements.

   2. To exercise our patience: Heb. vi. 12, Be followers of them who
   through faith and patience inherit the promises.' Our times are always
   present with us, but God's time is not yet come. A hungry stomach would
   have meat before it is roasted or sod. Impatient longings must have
   green fruit, and will not stay till it be matured and ripened. Now God
   will work us out of this impatience. The troubles of the world are
   necessary for patience as well as faith.

   3. To try our love. Though we be not feasted with felt comforts and
   present benefits, yet God will try the deportment of his children, if
   indeed he be the delight of their hearts: Isa. xxvi. 8, Yea, in the way
   of thy judgments, O Lord, have we waited for thee.' When we love God,
   not only when our affections are bribed by some sensible experience or
   comfort, but when we can love God in the way of his judgments. A child
   of God is a strange creature; he can love God for his judgments, and
   fear him for his mercies. When our heart is like lime, the more water
   you sprinkle upon it, the more it burns; our desires glow the more, the
   more disappointments we seem to meet with. We love his benefits more
   than we love God, when we delight in him only when he doth us good. But
   when we can delight in him even when our desires are delayed, and
   nothing appears but tokens of God's displeasure, this is delight
   indeed.

   4. To enlarge our desires, that we may have a greater income of his
   mercy, as a sack that is stretched out holds the more. God will have
   the soul more stretched out when he means to fill it up with grace.
   Delays increase importunities: Ask, seek, knock,' Mat. vii. If God will
   not come at the first asking, we must seek; if seeking will not bring
   him, we must knock, be importunate, have no Nay: Luke xi. 8, For his
   importunity sake he will arise.' The man is impudent; he stands
   knocking, and will not be gone.

   Fourthly, God may seem sometimes to deny a request, yet the end of the
   request is accomplished. For instance, God's children they have an end
   in their requests; we pray for the means with respect to an end. Now
   many times God gives the end when he will deny the means. Paul had
   grace sufficient, though the thorn in his flesh were not removed, 2
   Cor. xii. 9. A Christian prays for the light of God's countenance, for
   sensible feeling of God's love. Why? To strengthen him in his way. Now
   God denies him comfort, because he will do it by the word of promise,
   it shall not be by sensible comfort. We pray for victory over such a
   lust, the mortification of such a sin. Why? That we may serve God more
   cheerfully. God denies such a degree of grace, because he will mortify
   a greater sin, which is pride in the heart. And thus we miss the
   particular that we desire, yet still we have the end of the request. We
   pray for giving success to such an enterprise. Why? That we may serve
   God safely. God will bring it about another way.

   Fifthly, If God do not give us the blessings themselves we ask, yet he
   gives us many experiences by the by in the manner of asking; one way or
   other something comes into the soul by praying to God; as those in Ps.
   lxxxiv., their end was to go to Jerusalem, but in passing through the
   valley of Baca, they met with a well by the way. So we meet with
   something by the way, some light, or some sweet refreshing, some new
   consideration to set us a-work in the spiritual life. By praying to
   God, unawares, unthought of by you, there are many principles of faith
   drawn forth in the view of conscience not noted before, some truth or
   other presented to the heart, or some spiritual benefit that comes in
   with fresh light and power, that was never aimed at by us.

   Use 1. If God be so ready to hear his people, let us not throw away our
   prayers as children shoot away their arrows; but let us observe God's
   answer, what comes in upon every prayer. In every address you make to
   God, put the soul in a posture of expectation: Ps. v. 3, I will pray
   and look up;' and Ps. lxxxv. 8, I will hear what God the Lord will
   speak; for he will speak peace unto his people.' See what God speaks
   when you have been praying and calling upon him. It argues a slight
   formal spirit when you do not observe what comes in upon your
   addresses. To quicken you to this, know--

   1. If you observe not his answer, God loseth a great deal of honour and
   praise; for it is said, Ps. l. 15, Call upon me in time of trouble, and
   I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.' Every answer of prayer
   makes for the glory of God; and Col. iv. 2, Continue in prayer, and
   watch in the same with thanksgiving.' You are not only to see how your
   hearts are carried out in prayer, but watch for God's answer, that you
   may gather matter of praise. We should not be so barren in gratulation
   as usually we are, if we were as ready to observe our experiences as to
   lay forth our necessities.

   2. You lose many an argument of trust and confidence. Answers of prayer
   are an argument against atheism, which is so natural to us, and inbred
   in our hearts; it persuades us that there is a gracious being: Ps. lxv.
   2, thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.' We have
   called upon him, and found that there is a God, and against the natural
   unbelief which doubts of his truth in his promises: Ps. xviii. 30, The
   word of the Lord is a tried word; he is a buckler to all those that
   trust in him.' Well, saith the soul, I will build upon it another time;
   there is more than letters and syllables in it; there is something that
   speaks God's heart. So Ps. cxvi. 2, The Lord hath heard my voice and my
   supplications: because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will
   I call upon him as long as I live.' Promises shall not lie by as a dead
   stock; I will be pleading them.

   3. It increaseth our love to God. When we see how mindful he is of us,
   and kind to us in our necessities, it is a very taking thing. Visits
   maintain friendship; so when God is mindful of us, it maintains an
   intercourse between God and us: Ps. cxvi. 1, I love the Lord, because
   he hath heard my supplications.' Therefore observe what comes in upon
   your prayers, especially when your hearts are earnestly carried out by
   the impulses of his grace.

   Use 2. To admire the goodness of God to poor creatures, that he should
   be at leisure to attend our requests: I declared my ways, and he heard
   me.' When a poor soul, that is of no regard among men, shall come with
   conflicts and temptations, and the Lord presently hear him, it renders
   his grace truly admirable: Ps. xxxiv. 6, This poor man cried, and the
   Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.' He doth not
   say, this eminent prophet or this great king, but this poor man. Oh,
   that such contemptible persons as we should have such audience! For
   great ones here in the world to let a poor man tell his tale at large,
   that would be counted great patience, much more if he finds relief in
   the case. But beyond all this, observe the goodness of God. The more we
   declare our ways, the sooner doth he hear us; he doth not turn away
   from us when we tell him plainly we cannot believe in him, or trust in
   him. Come to a man and tell him, You have made me great promises, but I
   cannot believe you speak truth--this will provoke him; but when you
   come to the Lord and say, Lord, thou hast made a great many promises;
   though we cannot trust as we should, yet we have declared our sins,
   conflicts, temptations, yet, Lord, pity our weakness.

   Thirdly, Here is his petition, Teach me thy statutes.'

   First, I observe, David having been once heard of God expects to be
   heard in the like manner again. Here, Thou hast heard me;' and then
   comes with a new request, Teach me thy statutes.'

   Doct. 1. Those that have sped with God in one address, they will be
   dealing with God for more mercy; for so doth David. The reason is--

   1. Because God is where he was at first; he is not weary by giving, nor
   doth waste by giving; but what he hath done that he can do, and will do
   still. I AM is God's name; not I was, or will be; for ever remaining in
   the same constant tenor of goodness and power. His providence is still
   new and fresh every morning. God is but one, always like himself. He
   hath not so spent himself but he can work again. Creatures have soon
   spent their allowance, but God cannot be exhausted. There is no decay
   of love or power in him, no wrinkle in the brow of eternity. There was,
   is, and will be a God.

   2. Experience breeds confidence. The apostle teacheth us so, Rom. v. 4.
   When we have had former experience of God's readiness to hear us, it is
   an argument that breeds confidence of the like audience for the future.
   He that delivered me out of the mouth of the lion,' &c. God, that hath
   been gracious, surely will be gracious still, for then promises are
   sensibly confirmed, and then former mercies are pledges of future. By
   giving, God becomes a debtor: Mat. vi. 25, Is not life more than meat,
   and the body than raiment?' Our Saviour's argument was this, If God
   give life, he will give food; if a body, he will give raiment. If he
   hath given grace, the earnest of the Spirit, tie will give glory. If he
   hath given us Christ, he will give us other things together with him.
   If he hath begun with us, he will end with us, Phil. i. 6. One mercy is
   the pledge of another.

   3. We are endeared to God not only by acts of duty, but by every act of
   mercy. What is the argument he urgeth for Sion: Zech. iii. 2, Is not
   this a brand plucked out of the fire? The Lord rebuke thee, Satan.'
   Have not I delivered Sion, and shall I suffer that to be destroyed
   which I have delivered? The Lord urgeth his own mercy and his former
   kindness.

   Use. To quicken us not to grow weary of dealing with God. Let us go
   often to God. Men think it an uncivil importunity to be required to do
   more when they have done already; Solomon gives us that advice, Prov.
   xxv. 17, Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house, lest he be weary
   of thee, and so hate thee.' Men waste by giving, but God doth not; when
   you have been with him, and he hath done liberally for you, yet he
   upbraids you not. God, that hath vouchsafed grace, you may desire the
   continuance of his grace, and to crown his own grace.

   Secondly, Observe, the mercy which he asks is God's help in a course of
   holiness, namely, to walk worthy of the mercy.

   Doct. 2. They that upon declaring their ways have found mercy with God,
   their care should be to walk worthy of the mercy.

   The Lord hath heard me. What then? Teach me thy statutes.' So Ps.
   lxxxv. 8, The Lord will speak peace to his people, but let them no more
   return unto folly.' Mark, when God hath spoken peace, when they have an
   answer of peace, after you have prayed to God, take heed of turning to
   folly; do not lose the favour you have got; walk more holily and more
   worthy of such a mercy: Mat. vi. 12, Forgive us our sins.' What then?
   Lead us not into temptation.' Upon supposition the Lord hath forgiven
   us our sins, oh! let us not sin again. Many would invite God to favour
   their ways when they have no respect to his ways, which is in effect to
   make God a servant to our lust; but if you would have mercy from the
   Lord, beg that you might walk worthy of the mercy. The children of God
   should do so upon a double ground--in point of prudence and
   thankfulness. la point of prudence, as they have smarted under their
   former folly; and in point of thankfulness, as they have tasted the
   Lord's grace in his answer.

   1. When you have declared your way with brokenness and bitterness of
   heart, you have experience of the evil of sin; and when you know how
   bitter it is by sound remorse, it is folly to return to it again: Josh.
   xxii. 17, mark the reason, Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us,
   from which we are not cleansed unto this day?' Our former sense of the
   evil of sin when declaring it should be a restraint to us, else your
   cure is in vain. A man that is recovered out of a deep disease is
   willing to escape the like again; or, as Christ said to the man that
   had an infirmity thirty-eight years, Go thy way, sin no more, lest a
   worse thing happen unto thee.' When a man hath had the bitter sense of
   the fruit of sin, this will make him more cautious for the future. They
   are foolish children that remember beating no longer than it smarts,
   when they are scarce yet whole of the old wound. Though God hath taken
   out the sting of the sin, and granted us comfort, yet remember your
   former smart, that you may not fall into it again.

   2. Out of thankfulness for God's gracious answer. Every answer of grace
   leaves an obligation upon the sinner that he may not offend God again.
   See what a holy argument is used, Ezra ix. 13, Should we after such a
   deliverance as this break thy commandment?' Will you again relapse? So
   Luke vii. 47, For her sins are forgiven her, therefore she loved much.'
   Grace melts the heart. When a man hath received much mercy from God,
   his heart is wrought out into thankfulness; and the more they have been
   in sin, the more will they be in godliness when once they have tasted
   the sweetness of pardon, and had an answer of grace from God.

   Thirdly, Note, they that would steer their course according to God's
   holy will had need of the conduct and assistance of his Holy Spirit;
   for he goes to God, O Lord, teach me thy statutes,' Ps. xxv. 4; 1 Show
   me thy ways, O Lord, teach me thy paths;' and Ps. xxvii. 11, Teach me
   thy way, O Lord, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies;'
   and Ps. lxxxvi. 11, Teach me thy way, O Lord, I will walk in thy truth:
   unite my heart to fear thy name.' These places show that he addressed
   himself to God that he might not follow any sinful course in the time
   of trouble and temptation, that he might not dishonour God.

SERMON XXVIII.

   Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk of thy
   wondrous works.--Ver. 27.

   IN the former verses the man of God layeth forth his calamitous
   condition, and beggeth comfort and audience, not merely to prosper his
   affairs, but to better his heart. Many will invite God to favour their
   ways when they have no respect to his ways, which in effect is to make
   him a servant to their lusts. But David's chiefest care was about duty
   rather than success; therefore he desireth God to direct him how to
   walk in the way of his precepts; his heart was much upon that.

   In the close of the former verse he had said, Teach me thy statutes;'
   and here again, Make me to understand the way of thy precepts,' &c.

   In the words there is--(1.) A request; (2.) An argument. Where in is
   intimated--(1st.) The fruit of divine illumination; he should thereby
   see his wondrous works. (2d.) His duty thereupon; then will I talk of
   them. The word signifieth also to meditate. Sept.--I will exercise
   myself. It should be his delight to think and speak of the admirable
   goodness of God, and the divine excellencies of his word, and the
   pleasures that result from the practice of it. (3d.) He intimateth the
   sincerity of his desire, propounding this as his end, That I may talk;
   that I may be useful and edifying in my converse with others.

   The first thing that I shall observe is, that David doth so often beg
   again and again for understanding.

   Doct. That a sound and saving knowledge of the truths of the gospel is
   such a blessing as the children and people of God think they can never
   enough ask of him.

   We have abundant proof of it in so much of this psalm as we have
   already gone over.

   First, What is a sound saving knowledge?

   1. Such as doth establish the heart against all delusions, and keepeth
   us on truth's side. Many have some scraps of knowledge, loose and
   uncertain motions, [10] but they are not settled and grounded in the
   truth, and therefore the unlearned and unstable are joined together: 2
   Peter iii. 16, Which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as
   they do also the other scriptures, to their own destruction.' Unskilful
   and unsettled Christians lie open to every fancy; they have not such a
   stock of truth as may keep them savoury and sound in the faith. To be
   able to prattle a little in religion is not sound knowledge, but we
   must be grounded and settled in the faith,' Col. i. 23; that is, have
   not only some floating opinion, but well-grounded persuasion of the
   truth, so as we know we are upon firm ground, and dare venture our
   souls upon it, and may build surely and safely upon such principles. He
   calleth it elsewhere, Col. ii. 2, The riches of the full assurance of
   understanding, to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, and of the
   Father, and of Christ.' When men rest contented with obvious truths, or
   a slight knowledge of the common and easy principles of Christianity,
   there is not such an awe upon their practice, nor any establishment of
   their judgments, but, like light chaff, they are soon carried with the
   blasts of temptation, and the winds of error. And therefore we need to
   ask again and again, Give me an understanding of the way of thy
   precepts.'

   2. A sound saving knowledge is such as causeth the soul to lie under
   the dominion, life, and power of the truth, and aweth and commandeth
   the heart into obedience: John viii. 32, Ye shall know the truth, and
   the truth shall make you free;' when our knowledge freeth us from the
   slavery of sin. In others, that content themselves with a naked
   knowledge, truth is held captive, and cannot break out with any
   sovereignty in their conversations: Rom. i. 18, Holding the truth in
   unrighteousness.' Lust beareth sway, but truth lieth under fetters and
   restraint; it may talk its fill, like a man in bonds, but it can do
   nothing.

   3. When it giveth us prudence how to practise. This is that which David
   beggeth of God, to understand the way of his precepts; that is, to be
   taught how to walk in each duty and point of conversation, after what
   sort he may live and direct his life. It is not sufficient to know the
   meaning of the word in general, to have a notional understanding of it;
   but to reduce it to practice, where, and when, and how we ought to
   perform each action. Some have a naked model of truth, are wise in
   generals, but fail in the application of the rule, and are to seek in
   the ordering of their steps, and all particular cases: 1 Peter iii. 7,
   Husbands, dwell with your wives as men of knowledge.' Then is a man a
   man of knowledge when he knoweth how to order the passages of his life
   in every relation according to the will of God. The narrow way of
   obedience is hardly found, hardly kept, and easily mistaken, especially
   where prejudices, lusts, and interests, are apt to pervert us.
   Therefore prudence to apply the rule is necessary: Ps. cxix. 33, Teach
   me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes, that I may keep it to the end;'
   not only in the general points of faith and godliness, but that it may
   season all our actions, that we may be made partakers of the sweet
   refreshments that flow from it; such a knowledge as endeth in a taste:
   1 Peter iii. 2, 3, As new-born babes desire the sincere milk of the
   word, that ye may grow thereby, if so be ye have tasted,' &c. So Ps.
   xix. 8, The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart;' when
   we do so approve and follow the Lord's directions that we experience
   the sweetness, and are acquainted with the peace and joy in the Holy
   Ghost; such an understanding as begets judgment and feeling, or maketh
   us to find power and comfort in the word.

   Secondly, The children of God think this can never be enough asked of
   God. Why?

   1. Because of the excellency of knowledge: Light is comfortable, and it
   is a pleasant thing to behold the sun,' much more the light of the
   gospel shining in upon our minds. Oh, what a pleasant thing is that,
   when all clouds vanish, and the truths of God are fully cleared up to
   the soul! None knoweth the sweetness of it but he that hath experienced
   it: Prov. xxiv. 13, 14, My son, eat thou honey because it is good, and
   the honeycomb which is sweet to thy taste; so shall the knowledge of
   wisdom be unto thy soul, when thou hast found it.' The more perfect the
   operation of any faculty of the soul is, the greater the contentment.
   The conscience in the feeling of God's love, the heart when it findeth
   liberty in the ways of God, and the understanding upon the sight of the
   truth, cause all doubts and scruples to vanish. Therefore certainly
   they that know anything of God will be pressing to know more of his
   nature and will; one degree draweth on another. Moses desireth God,
   Tell me thy name,' Exod. iii. 13, 14. Then Show me thy glory,' Exod.
   xxxiii. 18. And he said, I beseech thee show me thy glory.' And Hosea
   vi. 3, Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord.' They are
   not cloyed, but desire more. The more men know the things of God, the
   more they admire them; the more they admire them, the more they love
   them; and the more they love them, the more they desire to know of
   them. And therefore do they insist so much upon this request, Make me
   to understand the way of thy precepts.'

   2. Because of the vastness and latitude of it. Knowledge is a growing
   thing; religion cannot be taken up all at once. We receive a little
   now, and a little anon; as narrow-mouthed vessels take in things drop
   by drop. We read of Jesus Christ, that he grew in knowledge: we do not
   read that he grew in grace: Luke ii. 52, He increased in wisdom and
   stature;' as his body increased in stature, so his soul in wisdom. And
   still Christians are growing in knowledge, and understand more of the
   mysteries of the gospel. Though speculative know ledge may be at a
   stand, and a man may see round about the compass of revealed truths,
   yet practical knowledge is never at a stand. Directive, affective,
   operative knowledge is never at a stand, but increaseth, daily. And
   therefore the apostle saith, He that thinketh he knoweth anything,
   knoweth nothing as he ought to know,' 1 Cor. viii. 2. Many think they
   know as much as can be taught them; surely they have no experience.

   3. Natural blindness is an obstinate disease, and hardly cured;
   therefore again and again we had need to pray, Open mine eyes, teach me
   thy statutes, make me to understand the way of thy precepts. Our
   ignorance is great when it is cured in part. The clouds of temptation
   and carnal affection cause it to return upon us, so that we know not
   what we know. Therefore open my eyes, cause me to understand.' Yea, the
   more we know, the more is our ignorance discovered to us: Prov. xxx. 2,
   3, Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the
   understanding of a man: I neither learned wisdom, nor have the
   knowledge of the holy;' Job xlii. 5, I have heard of thee by the
   hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth thee.' Alas! a poor little
   hearsay knowledge availeth not. They abhor themselves when they have
   more intimate acquaintance; none so confident as a young professor that
   knoweth a few truths, but in a weak and imperfect manner. The more we
   know indeed, the more sensible we are of our ignorance, how liable to
   this mistake and that, that we dare not trust ourselves for an hour.

   4. Because of the profit that cometh by knowledge. All grace from first
   to last cometh in by the understanding. God in the work of grace
   followeth the order which he hath established in nature. Reason and
   judgment are to go before the will; and therefore, when the work of
   grace is first begun in us, it beginneth in the understanding: Renewed
   in knowledge,' Col. iii. 10. So the increase of grace: 2 Peter i. 12,
   Grace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus
   Christ our Lord.' As the beginning is by light, so is all the gradual
   progress of the spiritual life; strength to bear afflictions, strength
   in conflicts, is by powerful reasons; yea, the perfect change that is
   made in us in glory is by the vision of God: We shall see him as he is,
   and shall be like him.' If we had more knowledge of God and his ways,
   we should trust him more, fear him more, love him more. Trust him, Ps.
   ix. 10, And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee; for
   thou, Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.' If God were more
   known he would be better trusted: 2 Tim. i. 12, I know whom I have
   believed;' I dare trust him with my soul. More feared: 3 John 11,
   Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that
   doth good is of God, he that doth evil hath not seen God.' Eight
   thoughts of God would not let us sin so freely; one truth or other
   would fall upon us, and give check to the temptation: as feared, so
   loved more. The more explicit thoughts we have of his excellency, the
   more are our hearts drawn out to him: John iv. 10, If thou knewest the
   gift,' &c. Christ would not lie by as a neglected thing if he were more
   known in all his worth and excellency.

   Use. The first use is to press you to get knowledge, and look upon it
   as a singular grace if the Lord will give you to understand and apply
   the comfort and direction of his holy word: John xv. 15, Hence forth I
   call you not servants, for the servant knoweth not what his lord doth;
   but I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard of my
   Father I have made known unto you.' To be taught the mind of God is a
   greater act of friendship than if God should give a man all the
   treasures of the world; to make himself known so as you may love him,
   fear him, trust him. When we can apply this for our comfort, oh! then,
   cry for knowledge, lift up thy voice for understanding; seek her as
   silver, and search for her as for hidden treasures,' Prov. ii. 3, 4. Go
   to God, and be earnest with him, Lord, make me to understand the way of
   thy precepts.' We can walk in the ways of sin without a teacher, but we
   cannot walk in the ways of God. And cry, lift up thy voice. We are
   earnest for quickening and enlargement; but be earnest also for
   understanding. Now a large prayer without endeavours is nothing worth.
   Dig in the mines of knowledge, search into the scripture, do not gather
   up a few scattered notions, but look into the bowels. Silver doth not
   lie on the surface of the earth, but deep in the bottom of it, and will
   cost much labour and digging to come at. If we would have any good
   stock of knowledge, which will prevent vain thoughts, carnal discourse,
   abundance of heart-perplexing scruples and doubts, and much darkness
   and uncomfortableness of spirit, it will cost us some labour and pains.
   The more knowledge we have, the more are we established against error:
   2 Peter iii. 17, Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things
   before, beware lest ye also being led away with the error of the
   wicked, fall from your own steadfastness.' The more you have of this
   divine saving knowledge, the greater check upon sin: Ps. cxix. 11, I
   have hid thy word in my heart, that I might not sin against thee.' One
   truth or another will rise up in defiance of the temptation. The
   greater the impulsion to duty, the more of the law of God, the more it
   urgeth the conscience, Prov. vi. 22. It maketh us more useful in all
   our relations:--Husbands, 1 Peter iii. 7, Dwell with them according to
   knowledge,' &c. Parents, Eph. vi. 4, Fathers, provoke not your children
   to wrath, but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.'
   Friends, Rom. xv. 14, And I myself also am persuaded of you my
   brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge,
   able also to admonish one another.' Magistrates, that they may discern
   Christ's interest, Ps. ii. 10, Be wise now, therefore, kings, be
   instructed, ye judges of the earth.' When Solomon asked wisdom, the
   thing pleased the Lord. And lastly, more comfortable in ourselves; that
   they may comfort and build up one another whenever they meet together.

   Use 2. To press you to grow in knowledge. None have such confidence and
   rejoicing in God as those that have a clear sight and understanding of
   his will revealed in his word. Let your knowledge--(1.) Be more
   comprehensive. At first our thoughts run in a narrow channel. There are
   certain general truths absolutely necessary to salvation, as concerning
   our misery by sin, and the sufficiency of Christ to help us; but if we
   might rest in these, why hath God given us so copious a rule? The
   general sort of Christians content themselves to see with others' eyes,
   get the knowledge of a few truths, and look no further. Why, then, hath
   God given so large a rule? Fundamentals are few; believe them, live
   well, and you shall be saved. This is the religion of most. This is as
   if a man in building should only be careful to lay a good foundation,
   no matter for roof, windows, walls. If a man should untile your house,
   and tell you the foundation standeth, the main buttresses are safe, you
   would not like of it. A man is bound, according to his capacity and
   opportunity, to know all scripture, the consequences of every truth.
   God may and doth accept of our imperfect knowledge, but not when men
   are negligent and do not use the means. To be willingly ignorant of the
   lesser ways of God is a sin. We should labour to know all that God hath
   revealed. (2.) More distinct. Why? Truths are best known in their frame
   and dependence; as God's works of creation, when viewed singly and
   apart, every day's work was good, but when viewed altogether in their
   correspondence and mutual proportion to each other, were very good,
   Gen. i. 31. So all truths of God, take them singly, are good; but when
   you have them in their frame, and see how one suits with the other, and
   what a sweet harmony there is between all the parts of religion, then
   they are very good. (3.) More experimental, that you may taste the
   sweetness and power of the truths that you know: Phil. iii. 10, That I
   may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of
   his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death.' When we feel
   what we know, that is a mighty confirmation. The senses give the best
   demonstration. It is a disparagement to know Christ and be never the
   better for him; to have a knowledge of all the excellency of Christ,
   and how suitable he is to the soul; yet to feel nothing of comfort and
   quickening in our consciences. (4.) More practical: 1 John ii. 3, 4,
   And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments: he
   that saith I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and
   the truth is not in him.' Otherwise it is but a talking by rote, a man
   savingly knoweth no more than he practiseth. He that doth but speak
   after others, it is a rehearsal rather than a knowledge. What is
   practical light? It is directive and persuasive. (1st.) It is
   directive. A man grows more prudent, and more able to guide his course
   according to the rules of religion; faith is op posed not only to
   ignorance but to folly: ye fools, and slow of heart to believe.' A man
   may be a knowing man, yet a very fool in spirituals, if he hath not a
   knowledge how to guide him to trust in God, fear God, love God, and
   serve God, Hosea xiv. 7. (2d.) That is practical knowledge when it is
   persuasive, when it hath a lively force and efficacy upon the heart.

   Second point, Those whom God maketh to understand the way of his
   precepts see wondrous things therein.

   Ps. cxix. 18. Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things
   out of thy law.' Wonders are such things as do transcend our capacity;
   so all things about God are above the sphere of men, as the things of
   men are above the capacity of beasts. Now, the more understanding and
   insight we have in these things the more we wonder. Wonder usually is
   the fruit of ignorance; how then can knowledge breed wonder? The word
   discovers the o'ti, that it is so; but the manner how it is, and the
   wisdom of the contrivance, is that which begets reverence and
   admiration in a gracious soul; as Nazianzen saith of the eternal
   generation of Christ, Let the eternal generation of God be adored in
   silence. It is a marvellous thing to know that there are three in one,
   the Son from eternity, begotten before all the world, &c. So when we
   look into these things, our knowledge doth only show that they are; but
   what they are, and how great they are, that exceeds our capacity, and
   therefore we wonder.

   1. The doctrines of the scripture are wonderful concerning God and his
   works. The nature of God is a depth which we cannot fathom, no more
   than a nutshell can empty the ocean: Ps. cxxxix. 6, Such knowledge is
   too wonderful for me: it is high, I cannot attain unto it.' It is above
   our capacity; for a finite thing cannot comprehend an infinite.

   The creation of all things out of nothing, we believe it upon the
   testimony of the word, but it is too wonderful for us to search it to
   the bottom; yea, the framing of the body in the womb, so many different
   things out of the same seed, as flesh, and bones, and muscles, and in
   such an order and proportion: Ps. cxxxix. 14, I will praise thee, for I
   am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works, and that
   my soul knoweth right well.' If the commonness did not abate our
   observation, we would wonder at it. So his providence in governing
   every creature to their proper ends, especially his care over us, and
   conduct of us. Many, O Lord, are thy wondrous works which thou hast
   done, and thy thoughts which are to usward. They cannot be reckoned up
   in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more
   than can be numbered,' Ps. xl. 5. But especially the redemption of
   mankind is wonderful: 1 Tim. iii. 16, And without controversy great is
   the mystery of godliness: God was manifested in the flesh, justified in
   the spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in
   the world, received up into glory.' The mysteries of the gospel, every
   time we think of them, should strike admiration into our hearts. It
   could not sink into the head of any creature how to satisfy justice,
   and to make up the breach between God and us. That a virgin should
   conceive; the word be made flesh; that justice and mercy should so
   sweetly be brought together, and conspire in the salvation of a lost
   sinner, all these are wonders; and when we come to believe them indeed,
   to draw forth comfort from them, these are wonderful to us!

   The law of God is wonderful. Look to the precept or the sanction. Look
   to the precept. A wonderful purity there: I have seen an end of all
   perfection; but thy law is exceeding broad,' ver. 96 of this psalm.
   When a child of God sees how the law reacheth every thought, every
   motion, every operation of his soul, what wonderful purity is here! So
   a marvellous equity: The law is holy, just, and good;' and the
   commandment is good.' Rom. vii. 4. God hath given us such a law, if a
   man were free, yet, to ennoble his nature and live happily, he would
   choose such a rule. Then to see such wise precepts so ordered that in
   ten words God should comprise the whole duty of man: Deut. iv. 6, Keep,
   therefore, and do them; for this is your wisdom, and your understanding
   in the sight of the nations.' First, God hath provided in his law
   respects to himself. First the law provides for God, then for the
   creature. In the first commandment, Thou shalt have no other gods
   before me;' there is the object of worship. In the second, Thou shalt
   not make to thyself a graven image,' &c., the means of worship. Then
   the manner of worship in the third, Thou shalt not take the name of God
   in vain.' Then the time of worship in the fourth, Remember to keep holy
   the Sabbath day.' See how the Lord hath built up his law. Then as to
   men, see first God provides for those viceroys that do represent the
   great God, as our parents natural and civil, Honour thy father and thy
   mother,' &c.; then our ordinary neighbour; and there first for his
   life, and then for his relations, Thou shalt not kill, shalt not commit
   adultery;' then for his goods, Thou shalt not steal;' then for his good
   name. When a man sees the law of God in all its explications, when he
   considers the harmony and correspondence that is between all the parts
   of the law, then he will cry out, O wonderful! Come to the sanction by
   which the law is established and confirmed, by promises and rewards,
   such a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;' that a clod of
   earth should shine above the stars, and God provide such a happiness
   for us that we should be like the angels! Then threatenings, that God
   hath appointed such a punishment to hold the world in awe, as a worm
   that never dies, and the fire that never goes out;' the worm of
   conscience that shall vex us with the remembrance of our past folly,
   and the wrath of God that shall punish us for disobedience, and torment
   us for evermore. Still, O wonderful! So for the gospel, every article
   of faith is a mystery to be wondered at--Quot articuli, tot miracula.
   The disciples wondered when they saw the structure of the temple. Oh,
   how may we wonder when we see the spiritual temple, that is Jesus
   Christ in the fulness of his godhead! God dwelt symbolically by outward
   representations in the temple, but here he dwells bodily. When David
   had provided such a mass of money, 1 Chron. xxix. 7-9, they fell a
   wondering. Oh, but when the soul comes to view the unsearchable riches
   of grace in Christ Jesus, then it may cry out, wonderful! When we see
   some rare plot, all things suit harmoniously, we cry out, wonderful!
   This great mystery of godliness, the more we look into it, the more
   will we wonder at the wisdom of God discovered in and through Christ
   Jesus. For external providences, to see how God answers prayers, how he
   brings about our mercies according to our wants in a way we know not:
   Ps. xvii. 7, Show thy marvellous loving-kindness, thou that savest by
   thy right hand them which put their trust in thee.' In the very common
   favours that God vouchsafeth to us, there is something may be observed
   that may make us wonder, either for the time, manner, or measure. Also,
   in the internal effects of his grace upon the heart, when a man is
   convinced, and his own heart is ripped up to him by the power of the
   word, 1 Cor. xv. 25; Heb. iv. 12; and John iv. 29. As when Christ had
   convinced the woman of Samaria, and ripped up her life, she says, Come,
   see a man that hath told me all that ever 1 did.' When God comes in
   with such convictive evidence, and rips up our privy thoughts,
   wonderful. But especially in changing and renewing the heart; when a
   lion shall be turned into a lamb, a dunghill become a bed of spices, a
   swine become a saint, a persecutor an apostle, we, that had such bolts
   and restraints of sin upon us, when we get out; when we that were so
   wedded to sensual delights and worldly vanities are brought to delight
   in God, this is truly admirable! 2 Peter i. 9, He hath called us out of
   darkness into his marvellous light.' And then the comfort we have by
   the word of God, and the marvellous sweetness the practice of it
   diffuseth through the soul, it is unspeakable and glorious, 1 Peter i.
   8. So Phil. iv. 7, The peace of God that passes understanding shall
   guard your hearts,' &c. When a man hath settling and composure of
   spirit in the midst of tempests and storms, the heart is guarded
   against all fears and sorrows. When we consider what God hath done for
   our souls, every grace is a wonder: to depend upon what we see not; to
   be safe in the midst of a storm; to die, yet live; to be poor, yet make
   many rich; to have nothing, yet possess all things; these operations of
   grace are all wonders.

   Use 1. It informeth us that a man must be carried above his own sense,
   reason, and light, to understand such wonderful things. It is the
   apostle's argument: 1 Cor. ii. 9, 10, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,
   neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath
   prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them to us by
   his Spirit; for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things
   of God.' All things are seen by a suitable light, spiritual things are
   spiritually discerned, divine things by a divine light--Non loquendum
   de Deo sine lumine. If beasts would judge of human affairs, they must
   have the reason of men; if men of divine things, they must have divine
   illumination. There is a cognation between the faculty and the object.

   2. It informeth us what reason we have to respect the word of God. Many
   curious wits despise it as a mean knowledge in comparison of Aristotle,
   Plato, &c. All the doctrines of it are a continued mystery; there is
   nothing vulgar and of small moment there. If there be some rudiments,
   something common with other writings, there are greater things than
   these, even the deep things of God. Never was there such a revelation
   made to the world as this. You despise that which angels wonder at:
   Eph. iii. 10, And to make all men see what is the fellow ship of the
   mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God,
   who created all things in Jesus Christ: to the intent that now unto the
   principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the
   church the manifold wisdom of God.' And 1 Peter i. 12, Which things the
   angels desire to look into.' David saith, Thy testimonies are
   wonderful, therefore doth my soul keep them.' Oh, let this book of God
   be more dear to us! Oh, what trifles are all worldly riches to the
   unsearchable riches of the Lord's grace! Oh, how stupid are they that
   are not taken with such great things as these!

   3. Examine your profiting. It is one degree of profit to see so much in
   the word of God as to admire at it. Admire God's transcendent goodness
   in the pardon of sins. God giveth us such admirable precepts, assisting
   us in the performance of them, accepting our imperfect obedience; this
   giveth wonderful comfort in all our afflictions.

   Thirdly, Observe, he that is sensible of the wondrous things that are
   in God's word will be talking of them.

   1. It will be so.

   2. It should be so.

   1. It will be so. When the heart is deeply affected, the tongue cannot
   hold, but will run out in expressions of it; for out of the abundance
   of the heart the mouth speaketh.' When cheered and revived in their
   afflictions, they are transported with the thought, with the excellency
   of God: Ps. lxvi. 15, Come, and I will tell you what God hath done for
   my soul.' The woman, when she had found the lost groat, calleth her
   neighbours to rejoice with her. He that hath but a cold knowledge, will
   not be so full of good discourse.

   2. It should be so, in a threefold respect--for the honour of God, the
   edification of others, and for our own profit.

   [1.] For the honour of God, to whom we are so much indebted, to bring
   him into request with those about us. Experience deserveth praise; when
   you have found the Messiah, call one another to him: John i. 41-45,
   Andrew calleth Peter, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias;
   and Philip calleth Nathanael and saith unto him, We have found him of
   whom Moses in the law, and the prophets did write, Jesus of Nazareth
   the son of Joseph.'

   [2.] For the edification of others: Luke xxii. 32, And thou being
   converted, strengthen thy brethren.' True grace is communicative as
   fire, &c.

   [3.] For our own profit. He that useth his knowledge shall have more;
   whereas, on the contrary, full breasts, if not sucked, become dry. In
   the dividing, the loaves increased. All gifts, but much more spiritual,
   which are the best, are improved by exercise.

   Well, then, get a sense and experience of God's truth, and then speak
   of it to others. That which we have seen we are best able to report of.
   God giveth us experiences to this end, that we may be able to speak of
   it to others. None can speak with such confidence as those that have
   felt what they speak. Christ saith those that come to him shall not
   only have a spring of comfort themselves, but flow forth to others:
   John vii. 38, He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out
   of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.'

   Fourth point, In our desires of knowledge it is meet to propound a good
   end; as David here beggeth understanding, that he might see and
   discover to others what he had found in God's law. To know that we may
   know is foolish curiosity; to know that we may be known is vanity and
   ostentation; to see that we may sell our knowledge is baseness and
   covetousness. To edify others, this is charity; to be edified
   ourselves, this is wisdom. Good things must be sought to a good end: Ye
   ask and receive not, because ye ask amiss, to consume it upon your
   lusts,' James iv. 3. All things must be sought for to holy ends, to
   glorify God; much more spiritual gifts. The only good end is God's
   glory: Open thou my lips, that I may show forth thy praise,' Ps. li.
   15. We are to desire knowledge, that we may the more enjoy God, and the
   more glorify him.

   There is a natural desire of knowledge, even of divine knowledge; but
   we must look to our ends, that we may grow in grace, 1 Peter ii. 3;
   that we may be more useful for God; not merely to store the head with
   notions, or to vaunt it over others, as having attained more than they.
   No; it should be only to do good to our own souls, and to save others:
   Rom. xv. 14, I am persuaded that ye are filled with all knowledge, and
   able to admonish one another.' But now, to make a market of our
   knowledge, or to use it for our vile ends, that is naught. Not for
   boasting, ostentation, curiosity, and vain speculation, but for
   practice, should be our end. When we improve our stock well, we please
   God, and shall have eternal profit ourselves.

SERMON XXIX.

   My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according to thy
   word.--Ver. 28.

   A CHRISTIAN should neither be humbled to the degree of dejection, nor
   confident to the degree of security; and therefore he is to have a
   double eye, upon God and upon himself, upon his own necessities and
   upon God's all-sufficiency. You have both represented in this verse (as
   often in this psalm), his case and his petition.

   1. His case is represented, my soul melteth for heaviness.

   2. His petition and request to God, strengthen thou me according to thy
   word.

   First, His case, My soul melteth for heaviness.' In the original the
   word signifies droppeth away.' The Septuagint hath it thus, My soul
   fell asleep through weariness.' Probably by a fault of the
   transcribers, one word for another. My soul droppeth. It may
   relate--(1.) To the plenty of his tears, as the word is used in
   scripture: Job xvi. 20, My friends scorn me; but mine eye poureth out
   tears unto God,' or droppeth to God, the same word; so it notes his
   deep sorrow and sense of his condition. The like allusion is in Josh.
   vii. 5, The heart of the people melted, and became as water.' Or, (2.)
   It relates to his languishing under the extremity of his sorrow; as an
   unctuous thing wasteth by dropping, so was his soul even dropping away.
   Such a like expression is used in Ps. cvii. 26, Their soul is melted
   because of trouble;' and of Jesus Christ, whose strength was exhausted
   by the greatness of his sorrows, it is said, Ps. xxii. 14, I am poured
   out like water; all my bones are out of joint; my heart is like wax, it
   is melted in the midst of my bowels.' Be the allusion either to the one
   or to the other, either to the dropping of tears or to the melting and
   wasting away of what is fat and unctuous, it notes a vehement sorrow
   and brokenness of heart, that is clear: his soul was even melting away;
   and unless God did help him, he could hold out no longer.

   Doct. That God's children oftentimes lie under the exercise of such
   deep and pressing sorrow as is not incident to other men.

   David expresseth himself here as in a languishing condition which is
   not ordinary, My soul droppeth or melteth away for heaviness.'

   The reasons of the point are three:--

   1. Their burdens are greater.

   2. They have a greater sense than others.

   3. Their exercise is greater, because their reward and comfort is so
   great.

   1. Their burdens are greater than others, as temptation, desertion,
   trouble for sin. The good and evil of the spiritual life is greater
   than the good and evil of any other life whatsoever. As their joys are
   unspeakable and glorious, so their sorrows are sometimes above
   expression: A wounded spirit who can bear?' Prov. xviii. 14. Common
   natural courage will carry a man through other afflictions, oh! but
   when the arrows of the Almighty stick in their heart, Job. vi. 3, that
   is an insupportable burden. According to the excellency of any life, so
   are the annoyances and the benefits of that life. Man, that hath a
   higher life than the beasts, is more capable of delights and sorrows
   than beasts are of pain and pleasure; and so a Christian that lives the
   life of faith is more capable of a higher burden. Consider, they that
   live a spiritual life have immediately to do with the infinite and
   eternal God; and therefore when he creates joy in the heart, oh, what a
   joy is that! And when God doth but lay his hand upon them, how great is
   their trouble! Sin is a heavier burden than affliction, and the wrath
   of God than the displeasure of man--Coelestis ira quos premit miseros
   facit, humana nullos. Evils of an eternal influence are more than
   temporal, therefore must needs be greater and more burdensome.

   2. They have a greater sense than others, their hearts being entendered
   by religion. None have so quick a feeling as the children of God. Why?
   Because they have a clearer understanding, and more tender and delicate
   affections.

   [1.] Because they have a clearer understanding, and see more into the
   nature of things than those that are drowned in present delights and
   contentments. The loss of God's favour carnal men know not how to
   value, but the saints prefer it above life: The favour of God is better
   than life,' Ps. lxiii. 3. Therefore, if the Lord do but suspend the
   wonted manifestations of his grace and favour, how are their hearts
   troubled!' Thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled,' Ps. xxx. 7. A
   child of God, that lives by his favour, cannot brook his absence;
   therefore, when they lose the sweet sense of his favour and
   reconciliation with him, oh, what a trouble is this to their souls!
   Other men make no reckoning of it at all. And so for sin, common
   spirits value it only by the damage it doth to their worldly interests;
   when it costs them dear, they may hang the head: Jer. ii. 9, Now know
   what an evil and bitter thing it is to forsake the Lord.' A worldly man
   may know something of the evil of sin in the effects of it, but a child
   of God seeth into the nature of it; they value it by the wrong, by the
   offence that is done to God, and so are humbled more for the evil in
   sin, than for the evil after sin. So for the wrath of God; carnal men
   have gross thoughts of it, and may howl upon their beds when their
   pleasant things are taken from them; but God's children are humbled
   because their father is angry; they observe more the displeasure of God
   in afflicting providences than others do; and one spark of God's wrath
   lighting into their consciences, oh, what sad effects doth it work!
   more than all other straits whatsoever. Thus they have a clearer
   understanding, they see more into the dreadfulness of God's wrath, into
   the evil of sin, and they know how to prize and value his favour more
   than others.

   [2.] They have delicate and tender affections. Grace, that gives us a
   new heart, doth also give us a soft heart: Ezek. xxxvi. 26, I will put
   a new heart into them.' What kind of heart? A heart of flesh,' as the
   old heart that is taken out is a heart of stone. A new soft heart doth
   sooner receive the impression of divine terror than another heart doth.
   A stamp is more easily left upon wax, or a soft thing, than upon a
   stone. Or thus, a slave hath a thicker skin than one nobly born,
   tenderly brought up; therefore he is not so sensible of stripes. A
   wicked man hath more cause to be troubled than a godly man; but he is
   not a man of sense; he hath a heart of stone, and therefore is not so
   affected either with God's dealings with him, or his dealings with God.
   Look, as the weight of the blows must not only be considered, but the
   delicateness of the constitution, so, because their hearts are of a
   softer and more tender constitution, being hearts of flesh, and
   receptive of a deeper impression, therefore their sorrows exceed the
   sorrows of other men.

   3. The good that they expect is exceeding great, and their exercise is
   accordingly; for after the rate of our comforts so are our afflictions.
   Wicked men, that have nothing to expect in the world to come but
   horrors and pains, they wallow now in ease and plenty: Luke xvi. 25,
   Son, in thy lifetime thou receivedst thy good things.' God will be
   behindhand with none of his creatures; those that do him common service
   have common blessings in a larger measure than his own people have;
   they have their good things, that is, such as their hearts choose and
   affect. But now good men, that expect another happiness, they must be
   content to be harassed and exercised, that they may be fitted and
   prepared for the enjoyment of this happiness. As the stones that were
   to be set in the temple were to be hewn and squared, so are they to be
   hewn, squared, and exercised with bitter and sharp things, that they
   may be prepared for the more glory.

   Use 1. Then carnal men are not fit to judge of the saints when they
   report their experiences, if it be with them above the rate of other
   men. When afflicted consciences speak of their wounds, or revived
   hearts of their comforts, their joys are supernatural, and so are their
   sorrows; and therefore a natural man thinks all to be but fancy, all
   those joys of the Spirit, that they are but fanatic delusions; and he
   doth not understand the weight of their sorrows. When a man is well to
   see to, and hath health, strength, and wealth, they marvel what should
   make such a man heavy; all their care is to eat, drink, and be merry;
   and therefore because they are not acquainted with the exercises of a
   feeling conscience, they think all this trouble is but a little
   mopishness and melancholy. Poor contrite sinners, who are ready to weep
   out their hearts at their eyes, can only understand such expressions as
   these, My soul melteth away for heaviness.' There is another manner of
   thing in trouble of conscience than the carnal world doth imagine; and
   many that have all well about them, great estates, much befriended and
   esteemed in the world, yea, for the best things, yet when God hides his
   face, poor souls, how are they troubled! If he do but let a spark of
   his wrath into their conscience, and hide his face from them, it is a
   greater burden to them than all the miseries of the world.

   David was a man valiant, that had a heart as the heart of a Son,' 2
   Sam. xvii. 10. He was a man cheerful, called the sweet singer of
   Israel,' 2 Sam. xxiii. 1; of a ruddy sanguine complexion, and a great
   master of music. He was no fool, but a man wise as the angel of God;
   and yet you see what a bitter sense he had of his spiritual condition.
   And when a man so stout and valiant, so cheerful, so wise, complains so
   heavily, will you count this mopishness and foolish melancholy? But
   alas 1 men that never knew the weight of sin cannot otherwise conceive
   of it; they were never acquainted with the infiniteness of God, nor
   power of his anger, and have not a due sense of eternity; therefore
   they think so slightly of these matters of the spiritual life.

   Use 2. Be not too secure of spiritual joys. We warn you often of
   security, or falling asleep in temporal comforts, and we must warn you
   of this kind of security also in spiritual. All things change. You may
   find David in this psalm in a different posture of spirit; some times
   rejoicing in the word of God above all riches, and at other times his
   soul melteth away for very heaviness. God's own people are liable to
   great trouble of spirit; therefore you should not be secure as to these
   spiritual enjoyments, which come and go according to God's pleasure.
   Men that build too much upon spiritual suavities or sensible
   consolations occasion a snare to their own souls; partly as they are
   less watchful for the present (like mariners which have been at sea,
   when they get into the haven, take down their tackling, and make merry,
   and think never to see storm more), and so lose that which they are so
   confident of keeping; by their negligence and carelessness their
   spiritual comfort is gone. And there is another mischief--the loss is
   more heavy, because it was never thought of. And therefore in
   preparation of heart we should be ready to lose our inward comforts, as
   well as estates and outward conveniences. In heaven alone we have
   continual day without cloudings or night; but here there will be
   changes.

   Use 3. Let us not judge of our condition if this should be our case,
   that is, if we should lie under pressing troubles, such as do even
   break our spirits. This was the case of the Son of God; his soul was
   troubled, and he knew not what to say: John xii. 27, My soul is
   troubled; what shall I say?' And many of his choicest servants have
   been sorely exercised--Heman, an heir of heaven, and yet compassed
   about with the pains of hell; Job not only spoiled of all his goods,
   but for a time shut out from the comforts of God's Spirit. Our business
   in such a case is not to examine and judge, but to trust. Neither to
   determine of our condition one side or other, but to stay our hearts
   upon God, and so to make use of offers and inviting promises, when we
   cannot make use of conditional and assuring promises. So Isa. 1. 10, He
   that walketh in darkness, and seeth no light,' is directed, let him
   trust in the name of the Lord.' That is our business in such a case of
   deep distress, to make a new title rather than dispute the old one; and
   stay our hearts on God's mercy.

   Thus much concerning David's case; which because it often comes under
   consideration in this Psalm, I would pass over more briefly.

   Secondly, I come from David's case to his petition or request to God,
   Strengthen thou me according to thy word.' Where you have--

   1. The request itself.

   2. An argument to enforce it.

   First, The request itself, Strengthen me;' that is the benefit asked.

   Doct. 1. Observe this in the general, he doth but now and then drop out
   a request for temporal safety, but all along his main desire is for
   grace and for support rather than deliverance.

   The children of God, the main thing that their hearts run upon is
   sustentation and spiritual support rather than outward deliverance: Ps.
   cxxxviii. 3, I called upon the Lord, and he heard me, and strengthened
   me with strength in my soul.' Mark, David judgeth that to be an
   audience, to be a hearing of prayer; though he had not deliverance, yet
   he had experience of inward comfort, that was it which supported him.
   The children of God value themselves by the inward man, rather than the
   outward. What David here prays for himself, Paul prays for others: Eph.
   iii. 16, That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory,
   to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man.' Yea,
   they are contented with the decays of the outward man, so that the
   inward man may increase in strength: 2 Cor. iv. 16, Though our outward
   man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.' The outward man
   in Paul's dialect is the body, with the conveniences and all the
   appurtenances thereof, as health, beauty, strength, wealth; all this is
   the outward man. Now this is not a Christian's desire, to increase in
   the world, or to make a fair show in the flesh; no, but his heart is
   set upon this, to grow stronger in the spirit, that the soul, as
   furnished with the graces of the Spirit, may thrive; this is the inner
   man. To insist upon this a little.

   1. It is the inward man that is esteemed with God, and therefore that
   is it the saints mainly look after. God doth not look upon men
   according to their outward condition, pomp, and appearances in the
   world, but according to the inward endowments of the heart: 1 Sam. xvi.
   7, Man's eye is upon the outward appearance, but God regards the
   heart;' and the hidden man of the heart,' that is said to be an
   ornament of great price with God,' 1 Peter iii. 4. Intellectual beauty
   is that which is esteemed in heaven, and spiritual wealth is only
   current in the other world. Poor creatures, that are led by sense, they
   esteem one another by these outward things; but God esteems men by
   grace, by the soul, how that is cherished and strengthened; and though
   we are otherwise never so well accomplished, we are hated if we have
   not his image stamped upon us.

   2. The everlasting welfare of the whole person depends upon the
   flourishing of the inward man. When we come to put off the upper
   garment of the flesh, the poor soul will be destitute, naked, and
   harbourless, if we have made no provision for it, 2 Cor. v. 3, and then
   both body and soul are undone for ever. When the soul is to be thrown
   out of doors, whither will it go, if it hath not an eternal building in
   heaven to receive it? The soul is the man; the body follows the state
   of the soul, but the soul doth not follow the state of the body. The
   life of God, which he doth begin in the soul, does in time renew and
   perfect the body too. The apostle saith, Rom. vi. 11, The Spirit that
   now dwelleth in us will raise up our mortal bodies.' But now those that
   seek to preserve the outward man with the neglect of the inner, in time
   ruin both body and soul. Well, then, here is their care.

   3. The loss of the outward man may be recompensed and made up by the
   strength of grace that is put into the inner man, but the loss of the
   inner man cannot be made up by the perfections of the outward man. A
   man that is afflicted in his outward estate, God makes it up in grace;
   if he makes him rich in faith, in the experiences of his favour, the
   loss is made up and supplied more abundantly; and the children of God
   can comfort themselves in this, that their inward man is strengthened
   and renewed day by day, 2 Cor. iv. 16; so that a man may be happy
   notwithstanding breaches made upon the outward man. But when there is a
   wounded spirit, and God breaks into the inward man, then what good will
   riches, estate, and all these things do? They are as unsavoury things
   as the white of an egg.

   4. The outward man may fit us for converse with men, but the in ward
   man with God. We need bodies, and organs of speech, and reason, and
   present supplies, which fit us to converse with men; but we converse
   with God by thoughts and by grace, and by the perfections of the inward
   man; this fits us for communion with him.

   5. The life and strength of the inward man is a more noble thing than
   the strength of the outward man or the bodily life, for it draws nearer
   to the life of God, as the life and strength of the body draws nearer
   to the life, pleasure, and happiness of a beast. By the bodily life we
   eat, drink, labour, sleep, and so do the beasts; yea, many of the
   beasts excel us in the perfection of that kind of life. Lions excel in
   strength, roes in swiftness, eagles in long age; none of their
   pleasures are soured with remorse of conscience. But the inward
   spiritual life is called the life of God, Eph. iv. 18.

   6. The inward life is the beginning of our life in heaven. A glorified
   saint and a saint militant upon earth both live the life of God; and
   the life of grace is the same life for kind, though not for degree; and
   one that is glorified and one here upon earth differ but as a child and
   a man. But now the life of sense and the life of grace differ as a toad
   and a man, not only in degree, but also in kind.

   7. Yet further, this is that great thing which God hath been at such
   great expense about, to raise the being of the new creature: John vi.
   51, This is my flesh, which I give for the life of the world.' The
   supports, the strength of the inward man cost dearer than all other
   comforts whatsoever: it must have nobler supports, it must have the
   blood of Christ, daily supplies from heaven. But the other life is
   called the life of our hands, Isa. lvii. 10. We patch up to ourselves
   some conveniences for the sensible life by labour and service here in
   the world. Well, then, this is that which the children of God do mostly
   look after, that the inward life may be kept free from annoyance, and
   fit for the purposes of grace.

   Use. The use of this is to check our carnal and preposterous care for
   the outward man, to the neglect of the inward. How much are we for the
   outward man, that it may be well fed and well clothed, well at ease for
   the present life! There is all our care; but not so careful to get the
   soul furnished with grace, and strengthened and renewed by continued
   influences from Christ. Certainly if men did look after soul-strength,
   they would be more careful to wait upon God for his blessing. You may
   know the disproportion of your care for outward things and for the
   inward man by these questions.

   1. How much do you prize God's day, the means of grace, opportunities
   of worship, that are for the inward man? The Sabbath-day is a feast-day
   for souls. Now, when men are weary of it, it is the most burdensome day
   of all the week round: Amos viii. 5, When will the Sabbath be gone,
   that we may set forth wheat?' It is a sign they are carnal, when men
   count that day the only lost day: as Seneca saith of the Jews, they
   lost the full seventh of their lives, speaking of the Sabbath-day. So
   carnal men think it is a lost day to them, they look upon the Sabbath
   as a melancholy interruption of their affairs and business. The apostle
   James saith of those that are begotten by God, chap. i. 9, that they
   are swift to hear.' Certainly they that have an inward man to maintain,
   another life than an outward and animal life, must have the supply and
   will look after the comforts of it.

   2. Consider how differently we are concerned with bodily and soul
   concernments. If the body be but a little diseased, if we want an
   appetite to a meal, or a little sleep in the night, we complain of it
   presently; we inquire what is the cause, and look for a remedy. But
   what a wonderful disproportion is there as to the soul! It is a strange
   expression that, 3 John 2, I wish that thy body prosper as thy soul
   prospers.' Alas! we may say of the most, Oh, that their souls did
   prosper as their bodies, as they flourish in the conveniencies of the
   outward man!

   3. What care have you for the inward man, to adorn the soul, to
   beautify it with grace, that it may be of price and esteem with God, or
   to fortify it with grace? Now, when all our strength and travail is
   laid out for that which doth not conduce to the inward life, Isaiah lv.
   2, and we lay out our money for that which is not bread, it is a sign
   we are wholly carnal. We read in ecclesiastical story of one that wept
   when he saw a wanton woman decking herself with a great deal of care to
   please her lovers; saith he, Have I been so careful to deck my soul for
   Christ Jesus?

   4. Do you take in spiritual refreshments, even when afflictions abound?
   2 Cor. i. 5, As the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our
   consolation also aboundeth by Christ;' then you are affected as the
   children of God, whose heart and care runs out mainly for the in ward
   man. This in general.

   Doct. 2. Secondly, more especially observe he goes to God for strength.
   Let me show--

   1. What is this spiritual strength.

   2. How it is given out.

   3. How God is concerned in it. David goes to God, Lord, strengthen me.'

   First, What spiritual strength is. It is God's perfecting of his work.
   Strength supposeth life, therefore in general it is God's renewed
   influence; when he hath planted habits of grace, he comes and
   strengthens. There is gratia praeveniens, operans, et co-operans--there
   is preventing grace, working grace, and co-working grace. Preventing
   grace is when God converts us, when the Lord turns us to himself, and
   doth plant grace in the soul at first. Working grace is when God
   strengthens the habit. Co-working grace, when God stirs up the act, and
   helps us in the exercise of the grace we have. First he plants grace
   into the heart, then there is a constant influence, as the two
   olive-trees in Zechariah were always dropping into the lamps; and then
   by excitation and co-operation he stirs it up. Saith Austin, Unless God
   gives us the faculties, and unless he gives us the will, we can do
   nothing; and unless he concurs with the exercise of these faculties,
   still we cannot work in the spiritual life as we ought to do; and
   therefore first God infuseth grace, and then strengthens grace; first
   he worketh in us, then by us. First we are objects of his work, then
   instruments, to show wherein the strength of the soul lies.

   1. There are planted in the soul habits of grace. There are not only
   high operations of grace, but permanent and fixed habits, the seed of
   God that remaineth within us, 1 John iii. 9, which cannot be the
   indwelling of the Spirit; for this seed of God is some created thing:
   Ps. li. 10, Create in me a clean heart, God;' and it is some thing that
   grows: 2 Peter iii. 6, Grow in grace.' And therefore it is evident
   there are habits of grace planted in the soul, a good stock that we
   have from God at first, called the good treasure of the heart,' Mat.
   xii. These habits of grace are called armour of God,' the shield of
   faith,' the helmet of salvation.' This is the strength of the soul.

   2. But besides this, there is a continuance and an increase of these
   graces, when the Lord confirms his work, and perfects what he hath
   begun, Phil. i. 16. The apostle most notably sets it forth: 1 Peter v.
   10, The God of all grace make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle
   you.' All these words concern the habit, or the seed of grace in the
   soul; and to show God's concurrence towards our preservation in the
   spiritual state, he useth these words, Make you perfect;' that notes
   the addition of degrees that are yet wanting; stablish you,' that notes
   defending that grace which is already planted in the heart from
   temptation and dangers; and strengthen you,' that is, give you power
   for action or ability for working; and settle you,' that is to fasten
   the root more and more. All may be represented in a tree. Look, as a
   tree grown downward in the root is defended from the nipping of the
   weather, and stablished and strengthened against injuries from beasts,
   and being filled with sap, springs forth, and becomes fruitful; so the
   Lord settle you, &c.

   3. There is a concurrence of God to the act. Grace in habit is not
   enough, but it must be actuated and directed. About the act there are
   two things: The Holy Spirit actuates the grace that is implanted, draws
   it forth into exercise; so it is said, Phil. ii. 13, It is God that
   worketh in you both to will and to do,' that is, he does apply that
   grace in our heart, set it a-work; and then there is a directing or
   regulation of the soul to action: 2 Thes. iii. 5, The Lord direct your
   hearts into the love of God,' &c. Thus God plants grace in the heart by
   preventing us with his mercy and loving-kindness, taking us into
   favour; then he doth stablish us, and perfect it, root it in the soul
   more and more. Then as to the act, he doth excite and strengthen us.

   Secondly, The uses for which we have this strength from God. It serves
   for three uses--for doing, for suffering, and for conflicting, to bear
   us out in conflict; as our necessities are many, so must our strength
   be.

   1. Strength to perform duties. Weariness and uncomfortableness will
   soon fall upon our hearts, and we shall hang off from God, if the Lord
   doth not put forth a new force, and a new quickening upon our hearts;
   therefore the spouse saith, Cant. i. 4, Draw me, and we will run after
   thee. And here in this psalm, When the Lord shall enlarge my heart, I
   will run the ways of his commandments.' If we would be carried on with
   any fervour and motion towards God, we must go forth in the strength of
   God. The soul is a tender thing, and soon discomposed. When we think to
   go forth and shake ourselves as at other times, as Samson, we shall
   find fetters and restraints upon our soul. Therefore God's work must
   ever be done in God's strength.

   2. Strength for bearing of burdens with patience, that we may not faint
   under them: Col. i. 11, Strengthened with all might, according to his
   glorious power, unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness.'
   That we may not faint under our affliction: Prov. xxiv. 10, If thou
   faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.' God's children,
   before they go to heaven, will have their trials, they will have many
   burdens upon them: Heb. vi. 12, Be ye followers of them who through
   faith and patience inherit the promises.' There needs not only faith,
   but patience. There will be trouble. Now a heavy burden need have good
   shoulders. We pray for strength, that we may break through difficulties
   and afflictions that we meet in our passage to heaven.

   3. Strength for conflicts, that we may break through temptations. A
   Christian is not only to use the trowel but the sword. We cannot think
   to discharge duties or bear afflictions without a battle and conflict;
   therefore we need the strength of the Lord's grace to carry us through.
   Satan is the great enemy with whom we conflict, he is the manager of
   the temptation. This is the course of it; the world is the bait; the
   flesh is the traitor that works within men, which gives advantage to
   Satan; the devil lieth hidden, and by worldly things seeks to draw off
   our hearts from God. Now we are assaulted on every side, sometimes by
   the pleasures of the world, sometimes by the frowns and crosses of it;
   so that a Christian needs to be fit for all conditions: Phil. iv. 13, I
   can do all things through Christ that strengtheneth me;' for every way
   will the devil be enticing us to sin. Now these conflicts are either
   solicitations to sin, or tend to weaken our comfort; and in both
   respects we must have strength from God. Satan's first temptation is to
   draw us to sin; if he cannot weaken grace, then to disturb our comfort;
   if not to deny God, yet that we may suspect our own estate; and
   therefore he follows us with blasphemies and other temptations, until
   he hath made our lives wearisome, till we call our condition into
   question; and therefore, as grace is strengthened, so is comfort: Neh.
   viii. 10, The joy of the Lord is your strength.'

   Thus I have showed what is this spiritual strength, and what we beg of
   God when we say, Strengthen me;' and how this is given out, in what
   manner God conveyeth this strength to the soul, how suitable to our
   nature, to our temper, to our employment.

   Thirdly, How God is concerned in it. David goes to God for this
   benefit, Lord, strengthen me.' From first to last he doth all. We do
   not stand by the stability of our own resolutions, nor stand by the
   stability of gracious habits in ourselves, unless the Lord supply new
   strength. Not by the stability of our own resolutions, for these will
   soon fail; for David was under a resolution to keep close to God; yet
   he saith, My feet had well-nigh slipped.' What upheld him? Thy right
   hand upheld me.' I was mightily shaken, all purposes of holding on of
   godliness were even gone; but I am continually with thee. Neither is it
   the stability of gracious habits in themselves, for of themselves they
   are poor vanishing things; faith, love, and fear of God of themselves
   will soon vanish: Rev. iii. 2, Be watchful, strengthen the things which
   remain, that are ready to die. These are ready to die, therefore are
   only maintained by a renewed strength from God. It is the power of God
   that is engaged in our preservation. I might show in what order we have
   this from God; we are not only kept in general by the power of God
   through faith unto salvation,' 1 Peter i. 5, but all the persons work.
   The Father, his act is judicial: Eph. iii. 14, I bow my knees unto the
   Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that he would grant you to be
   strengthened with might in the inner man.' He issueth the grant, that
   such souls coming in Christ's name, and petitioning relief, should
   obtain it. And God the Son hath bought this strength for us, and he
   intercedes for constant supply; and therefore it is said, Phil. iv. 13,
   I can do all things through Christ.' Christ puts in strength, that is,
   he observes all our temptations, our conflicts, how weak we are; and he
   intercedes with God night and day; he stands at God's right hand, to
   get out this strength; and the Holy Ghost applies it to our heart in
   the ordinances; for so it is said, Eph. iii. 16, To be strengthened
   with might by his Spirit in the inner man.'

   Use. To press us to be dealing with God for this strength. What shall
   we do?

   1. Be weak in your own sense and feeling. The way to be strong i to be
   weak: 2 Cor. xii. 10, When I am weak, then am I strong.' The bucket, if
   we would have it filled with the ocean, must first be empty. Saith
   Austin, Nemo erit a Deo firmus, nisi qui seipsum sentit infirmum--God
   strengtheneth those that are weak in their own feeling and sense of
   their own nothingness: Heb. xi. 34, Out of weakness they were made
   strong;' out of weakness felt and apprehended.

   2. There must be a full reliance upon God's strength alone: Ps. lxxi.
   16, I will go forth in the strength of the Lord God;' and Eph. vi. 10,
   Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might;' and 2 Tim. ii.
   1, Be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.' What ever is in God
   and in Christ is for our use; it is forthcoming for our encouragement
   and help. We have firm grounds for this reliance--the infinite power of
   God, and the merit of Christ, which is of in finite value. What cannot
   the power of God do? The strength of God is engaged for our relief and
   succour.

   3. Use the power that you have, and then it will be increased upon you.
   The right arm is bigger than the left. Why? Because of exercise, it is
   fuller of spirits and strength: To him that hath shall be given,' Mat.
   xiii. 12, and he shall have abundance.' The more we exercise grace the
   more we shall have of it: Prov. x. 29, The way of the Lord is strength
   to the upright.' The more we walk with God the more strength.

   4. Use the means, for they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their
   strength,' Isa. xl. 31. Because God doth all, oh! it is the greatest
   engagement that can be to wait upon God in the use of means, that we
   may draw out treasures of grace in God's way: Phil. ii. 12, Work out
   your salvation, for it is God that worketh in you,' &c. See that you
   keep not off from God. Why? For he doth all.

   5. Avoid sin; that lets out your strength, as bleeding lets out the
   spirits of the body. When you grieve the Spirit of Christ which is to
   strengthen you, you cast away your strength from you. Let us then wait
   upon God for help, for when all things fail, God faileth not.

   Secondly, I now come to the argument, Strengthen me according to thy
   word.' God's word binds him to relieve his people in distress. There
   are two promises; one is, 1 Cor. x. 13, God will not suffer you to be
   tempted above that ye are able.' A good man would not over burden his
   beast; certainly the gracious God will not suffer temptations to lie
   upon us above measure. Another promise is in Isa. lvii. 15-17, To
   revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the
   contrite ones.' He hath promised comfort and relief to poor
   broken-hearted sinners; you are called by name in the promise, it is
   spoken to people in your case. Again, upon such a word and promise of
   God is David's prayer grounded. A prayer grounded upon a promise is
   like to prevail; you may put a humble challenge upon God, plead his
   word to him. It is strange fire else you put in the censer, when you
   beg that which God never undertook to grant. David often saith
   according to thy word.' Again, the word of God is the only cure and
   relief for a fainting soul. When David was languishing away under deep
   sorrow, then, Lord, thy word did bring strength. (1.) This is the
   proper cure. Natural means cannot be a remedy to a spiritual distemper,
   no more than a fine suit of apparel to a sick man, or a posy of flowers
   to a condemned man. Natural comforts carry no proportion with a
   spiritual disease; nothing but grace, pardon, strength, and acceptance
   from God can remove it. They that seek to quench their sorrows in
   excess and merry company take a brutish remedy for soul diseases.
   foolish creatures! that think to sport away or drink down their
   troubles! it is as foolish a course as to think that to sew up a rent
   in the garment will cure a wound in their body. And (2.) it is a
   universal cure; we have from the word life, comfort, strength. It is
   the word that must guide us and keep us from fainting, quicken us and
   keep us from dying. This is a full remedy in conjunction with the power
   of God, and makes the sore [11] joyful in the midst of outward
   troubles: Ps. lvi. 10, I will rejoice in God because of his word.'

   Lastly, This word must be applied to the conscience by God himself,
   Strengthen thou me according to thy word.' He goes to God that he would
   apply his word, that it might be for his strength; for we can neither
   apprehend nor apply it further than we receive grace from God. The word
   is God's instrument, and worketh not without the principal agent.

SERMON XXX.

   Remove from me the way of lying; and grant me thy law graciously.--Ver.
   29.

   THERE are two parts of Christianity--destructive and adstructive. The
   destructive part consists in a removing of sin; the adstructive part
   makes way for the plantation of grace; there is eschewing evil, and
   doing good. We are carried on in a forward earnestness in the way of
   sin, but there is a great backwardness and restraint upon our hearts as
   to that which is good. The one is necessary to the other; we must come
   out of the ways of sin before we can walk in the ways of God. In this
   prayer David respects both. (1.) In the first he instanceth in one sin,
   the way of lying;' not only lying, but the way of lying,' as being
   conscious to himself of his too often sinning in this kind. Now, he
   would not have this settled into a course or way; therefore he beggeth,
   Remove it, the guilt, the fault of it. (2.) As to the adstructive part,
   for the regulation of his conversation, he begs the favour and grant of
   the law, and that upon terms of grace. David had ever the book of the
   law, for every king of Israel was to have it always by him, and, the
   rabbis say, written with his own hand. But grant me thy law
   graciously;' that is, he desires he might have it not only written by
   him, but upon him, to have it imprinted upon his heart, that he might
   have a heart to observe and keep it. That is the blessing he begs for,
   the law; and this is begged graciously, or upon terms of grace, merely
   according to thine own favour and good pleasure. Here is--

   1. The sin deprecated, remove from me the way of lying.

   2. The good supplicated and asked, grant me thy law graciously.

   In the first clause you have his malady: David had been enticed to a
   course of lying. In the second we have his remedy, and that is the law
   of God.

   First, Let me speak of the evil deprecated; here observe--

   1. The object, the way of lying.

   2. God's act about it, remove from me, &c.

   First for the object, The way of lying.' It is by some taken generally,
   by others more particularly.

   1. For those that expound it more generally, they are not all of a
   mind. Some think by the way of lying is meant corruption of doctrine;
   others of worship; others apply it to disorders of conversation; some
   take it for error of doctrine, false opinions concerning God and his
   worship, which are called lying, and so opposed to the way of truth
   spoken of in the next verse, I have chosen the way of truth.' Heresy
   and false doctrine is called a lie, Ezek. xiii. 22, Their diviners
   speak lies;' so 1 John ii. 21, A lie is not of the truth;' and the word
   used, The way of lying' is elsewhere rendered a false way,' ver. 104,
   and ver. 128 there is the same expression. Now, this he desires to be
   removed from him, because it sticks as close to us as our skin. Error
   is very natural to us, and man doth exceedingly please himself with the
   figments of his own brain. All practical errors in the world are but
   man's natural thoughts cried up into a voluble opinion, because backed
   with defences of wit, and parts, and secular interests, and other
   advantages; they are but our secret and privy thoughts which have
   gotten the reputation of an opinion in the world; for we speak lies
   from the womb;' even in this sense we suck in erroneous principles with
   our milk. Nature carrieth us to wrong thoughts of God, and the ways of
   God, and out of levity and inconstancy of spirit we are apt to be
   carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men.' Now,
   to this sense the latter clause will well agree, Keep me from a way of
   lying,' that is, keep me from falling into error and mistakes about
   religion; for he begs that the law may be granted to him, or a certain
   stated rule, without which all things are liable to deceit and
   imposture. And according to this sense Austin beggeth that he may
   neither be deceived in the scriptures, nor deceive out of them; Nec
   fallar in iis, nec fallam ex iis--let me never be mistaken myself, nor
   cause others to mistake. Again, by a way of lying some understand false
   worship, for an idol is a lie: Isa. xliv. 20, Is there not a lie in his
   right hand?' meaning an idol. By others, a course of sinning, for a way
   of sinning is a way of lying, for it deceives us with a conceit of
   happiness which we shall never enjoy; therefore, Eph. iv. 22, Put off
   the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts.' Lusts
   are called deceitful, because they promise what they never perform;
   they flatter us not only with hopes of impunity, but much imaginary
   comfort and satisfaction; oh, but it is a lie! Satan deceived our first
   parents, pretending to show them a way of immortality, whereas that
   brought death to the world. Most go this way, Remove from me the way of
   lying, that is, the way of sin; and the rather because the Septuagint
   translation reads it thus, Remove from me the way of iniquity; and
   Chrysostom in his gloss. He means, every evil deed should be removed
   from him, or it proves a lie in regard of all those flatterings and
   blandishments by which it enticeth the soul. Nay, there is a parallel
   place seems to make good this sense, Prov. xxx. 8, when Agur prays
   against sin, Remove from me vanity and lies,' meaning a course of sin.
   Thus it is taken more generally.

   2. Those that take it more particularly for the sin of lying, or
   speaking falsely in commerce, they again differ. Some take it
   passively, keep me from frauds or deceits of other men; because it
   seems to be a hard thing to ascribe a way of lying to a child of God,
   therefore they rather take it passively. But this is to fear where no
   fear is. But David begs that he might be kept from a way of lying, that
   it might not settle into a way, that is his meaning. Therefore I rather
   take it actively, that he might not run into a false and fallacious
   course of dealing with others.

   Now why would David have this way of lying removed from him? Three
   reasons:--

   1. Because of the inclination of his corrupt nature. We had most need
   pray to be kept from gross sins: as Ps. xix. 13, Keep back thy servant
   also from presumptuous sins.' We need not only pray against lesser sins
   or spiritual wickedness, but from gross sins carried on presumptuously
   against the light of conscience. So Col. iii. 5, Mortify your earthly
   members,' &c. What members doth he speak of? Not worldliness and
   unbelief only; but he speaks of adultery, uncleanness, inordinate
   affections, and the like; and the children of God, if they do not deal
   with God for grace against their gross sins, they will soon know to
   their costs. Jesus Christ warned his own disciples, those that were
   trained up in his school, those that were to go abroad and deliver his
   gospel to the world: Luke xxi. 34, Take heed lest your hearts be
   overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness,' &c. A candle newly blown
   out easily sucks light and flame again; and we that are newly taken out
   of the dominion of sin into a state of grace, may suck light and flame
   again; therefore we had need pray against gross sins.

   2. Because he had been tripping and guilty in this kind. In the story
   of David you may trace too much of this way and vein of lying; as his
   feigning to Ahimelech the priest, 1 Sam. xxi. 8; and to Achish, 1 Sam.
   xxvii. 8, compared with ver. 10; his persuading Jonathan to tell his
   father he was gone about such a business. Now, this we may learn, when
   we are foiled by any sin, we should take heed lest we settle into a way
   and course of sin; for in every sin, as there is culpa, the fault, or
   the transgression of the law, and reatus, the guilt, or obligation of
   punishment, so there is macula, the blot, an inclination to sin again,
   in like manner as a brand once on fire is more apt to take fire again.
   By every act of sin the law of God is lessened, our carnal inclination
   is increased; therefore we had need be earnest with God, Lord, keep me
   from a way of lying.

   3. Man is strongly inclined to lying; it sticks close to our nature, so
   that God must remove it from us; as more fully afterwards. Thus for the
   object, a way of lying.

   Secondly, God's act about it, Remoye from me.' Sin is removed either in
   a way of justification, when the guilt of it is done away; this David
   might intend. But rather in a way of sanctification, when the fault or
   blot is done away. This is mainly intended, as appears by the
   antithesis or opposite request, and grant me thy law graciously;' that
   is, let it be impressed upon my heart, that such a temptation may be
   prevented for the future. Let me observe--

   Doct. That lying, especially a way or course of lying, should be far
   from God's people.

   David begs the removal of it, as most inconsistent with the temper and
   sincerity of a child of God. Examine--

   1. What is lying?

   2. Upon what grounds this should be far from a child of God?

   First, What is lying? Ans. Lying is when men wittingly and willingly,
   and with purpose to deceive, signify that which is false by gestures or
   actions, but especially by words. The matter of a lie is a falsehood;
   but the formality of it is with an intention to deceive; therefore a
   falsehood is one thing, a lie another. Then we lie when we not only do
   or speak falsely, but knowingly, and with purpose to deceive. Now this
   may be done by gestures, as when a scorner counterfeiteth the posture
   of one that is praying, or as when David feigned himself to be
   distracted, scrabbling upon the doors of the gate, spitting upon his
   beard, 1 Kings xxi. 1; and in the pagan story Junius Brutus was taxed
   for feigning himself a fool to save himself from Tarquin. Aquinas saith
   gestures are a sign by which we discover our minds. But because these
   are but imperfect signs, and speech is the usual instrument of
   commerce, therefore in words do we usually vent this sin. Now in our
   words we are said to lie two ways--assertorily or promissorily.

   1. Assertorily, in a matter past or present, when one speaketh that as
   false which he knoweth to be true, and that as true which he knoweth to
   be^false, which is called speaking with a double heart in scripture:
   Ps. xii. 2. With a heart and a heart;' that is, when we have one heart
   to furnish the tongue with what is false, and another heart to conceive
   of the matter as it is. An instance of this falsehood in our
   assertions, or untrue relating of things done, is Ananias and Sapphira,
   who brought part of the money for which he sold his possession, instead
   of the whole; therefore, Acts v. 3, Why hath Satan filled thy heart to
   lie unto the Holy Ghost, in keeping back part of the price?' It was a
   lie, because there was a false assertion in saying that it was the
   whole; and it was a lie to the Holy Ghost, partly as being pretended to
   be done by his motion when they were acted by Satan, counterfeiting
   spiritual actions; or a lie against the Holy Ghost, because the Holy
   Ghost, being last in order of the persons, is fitly represented as
   conscious to our ways and the workings of our hearts: it is in
   condescension to us, because it is most conceivable to us to reflect
   upon him as knowing our hearts, and all the workings of our souls: Rom.
   ix. 1, I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing
   me witness in the Holy Ghost;' and when the psalmist speaks of hiding
   himself from God, he saith, Whither shall I flee from thy Spirit?' Ps.
   cxxxix. 7. Or else a lie to the Holy Ghost, because of his presidency
   and superintendency over church affairs: Acts xiii. 2, The Holy Ghost
   said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have
   called them;' and Acts xx. 28, Take heed to the flock over which the
   Holy Ghost hath made you overseers.' Now, because this was an
   ecclesiastical or church case, therefore they are said to lie to the
   Holy Ghost, as one that is to supply Christ's place. It was not the sin
   against the Holy Ghost, but a lie against the Holy Ghost.

   2. Promissorily we lie when we promise things we mean not to perform.
   This is a great sin. Paul spent the great part of a chapter to excuse
   himself, because he was necessitated by providence to break promise of
   coming to Corinth, 2 Cor. i. 16-18. It was grievous to him that he
   should seem to use lightness, and not make good his word, though he
   were hindered by the providence of God. Vain and empty promises,
   wherein we make a great show of kindness to others, without any intent
   to perform, is a great sin: Prov. xix. 22, The desire of a man is his
   kindness; and a poor man is better than a liar.' What is the meaning?
   Some read it, that which is desired of a man is kindness: you come to a
   man in power and great place, and beg his favour in such a business and
   request, and they are too apt to promise you. Ay! but a poor man is
   better than a liar; you shall find among these great men very little
   faith. The desire of a man is his kindness, or that which a man should
   do in a great and high condition is to show you kindness. But now many
   that covet the praise and reputation of it, are very forward in
   promises, but fail in performance; therefore a poor man that loves you,
   and is an honest neighbour, and will do his best, is a surer friend and
   a thousand times better than such lying great men, that only give you
   good words, and sprinkle you with court holy water. Now there is a
   lying to men, and a lying to God.

   [1.] A lying to God, which is the worst sort, because it argues un
   belief and atheism, low thoughts of God, as if he were not omniscient,
   did not know the heart, and try the reins. How do we lie to God? Partly
   when we put him off with a false appearance, and make a show of what is
   not in the heart, as if he would be deceived with outsides and vain
   pretences. So Hosea xi. 12, it is said, Ephraim compasseth me about
   with lies, and the house of Judah with deceit.' God can see through and
   through all fair shows, and will not be mocked. We are said to lie to
   God when we perform not those professions and promises which we made in
   a time of trouble. Oh, when chastenings are upon us, then the vows of
   God are upon us! Men think they mean as they speak, but they are not
   conscious of the secrecy of their hearts: Ps. lxxviii. 36, They
   flattered me with their mouth, and they lied unto me with their
   tongue.' Their hearts were not sincerely set against sin, whatever
   professions of repentance they made. When there is a restraint upon our
   corruptions, then we think ourselves hearty and serious, because moved
   a little towards God. Moral integrity is when we intend not to deceive,
   but there was no supernatural sincerity to perform, as the event
   showed. They were only the fruit of the present pang, therefore it was
   said they lied unto him with their tongue. So Ezek. xxiv. 12, She hath
   wearied herself with lies, and her scum went not forth out of her,'
   speaking of her promises; when the pot was over the fire there seemed
   to be offers to throw off the scum, but she hath wearied herself with
   lies. And in this sense it is said, Hosea vii. 16, They return, but not
   to the Most High; they are like a deceitful bow;' that is, they did not
   seriously intend when they did promise. As a man that shoots, if he do
   not level right, and take care to direct the arrow to the mark, it will
   never hit; so they shoot, that is, they cast out promises to flatter
   God till they get out of trouble, but they do not seriously set their
   hearts to accomplish it.

   [2.] As to men, there are three sorts of lies--Mendacium jocosum,
   officiosum, et perniciosum: there is the sporting lie, tending to our
   recreation and delight; there is the officious lie, tending to our own
   and others' profit; and there is the pernicious and hurtful lie,
   tending to our neighbour's prejudice.

   (1.) The sporting lie, when an untruth is devised for merriment. We
   have no instance of this in scripture; but it is a sin to speak
   untruth, and we must not make a jest of sin: Prov. xxvi. 19, As a
   madman that casteth firebrands, arrows, and death, so is the man that
   deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport?' Have we nothing
   wherewith to refresh our neighbour but with the breach of God's law? If
   a Christian will be merry, let him sing psalms,' James v. 13; let him
   give thanks, Eph. v. 4, Not filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor
   jesting, which are not convenient; but rather giving of thanks;' that
   is, let him remember the sweet loves of God in Jesus Christ, and that
   is spiritual refreshment to a gracious heart. Let him not speak things
   against the sense of his own mind; let him use honest recreation.
   Certainly we that are to give an account for every idle word should not
   allow the sporting lie. Now to this sporting lie a fable or parable is
   not to be reduced, for that is only an artificial way of representing
   the truth with the more advantage, and putting of it into sensible
   terms which most are apt to apprehend; as Jotham brings in the trees
   that went forth to anoint a king over them, Judges ix. 8. Neither such
   sharp and piercing ironies as we find used by holy men in scripture, 1
   Kings xviii. 27; as Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud; for he is
   a God: either he is talking,' &c.; for this is a notable way to make
   truth strike upon the heart with some force; and therefore this must
   not be reduced to this sporting lie.

   (2.) The officious lie, for the help and relief of others. Many in
   stances of this we have in scripture. Thus Rebekah teacheth Jacob to
   lie that he might gain the blessing, Gen. xxvii.; and the Egyptian
   midwives saved the male children of the Israelites by feigning they
   were delivered before they came to them, Exod. i. 21; yet it is said
   they feared God, and it is rewarded by God. Non remunerata est fallacia
   sed benevolentia--not their lie, but their mercy is rewarded: their
   mercy is commended as proceeding from the fear of God, and their
   infirmities are pardoned. So Rahab spared the lives of the spies, by
   telling the men of her city that they were gone, when she had hid them
   under the stalks of flax, Josh. ii. 4-6. Thus Michal, to save David
   from the fury of her father, feigned him sick, 1 Sam. xix. 14; and
   David advised Jonathan to an officious lie, 1 Sam. xx. 6, 7; so vers.
   26, 28, 29. Thus Hushai, by temporising with Absalom, preserved David,
   2 Sam. xvi. 17-19, to divide his counsels pretendeth hearty affection
   to him.

   (3.) There is a pernicious lie, that is to the hurt and prejudice of
   another. Of this nature was the first lie, by which all mankind was
   ruined--the devil's lie to our first parents, Ye shall be as gods,'
   Gen. iii. 4, 5. And of this nature was the patriarchs' lie concerning
   Joseph, when they spake to his father, Gen. xxxvii. 31, 32, This have
   we found, and know not whether it be thy son's coat or no,' yet they
   knew well enough; and that of the Jewish elders that said, Mat. xxviii.
   12, 13, Say ye, his disciples came and stole him away while we slept.'
   All these are severely forbidden, but especially in point of witnessing
   in courts of judicature: Exod. xxiii. 1, Put not thine hand with the
   wicked to be an unrighteous witness;' and ver. 7, Keep thee far from a
   false matter,' &c. Now some question whether all these lies be sin or
   no, sporting or officious lies. All these sorts of lies are sins; for--

   1. The scripture condemns all without restriction: Eph. iv. 25,
   Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his
   neighbour;' Rev. xxi. 8, all liars are shut out of the New Jerusalem,
   Arid all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with
   fire and brimstone;' and Rev. xxii. 15, Whosoever loveth and maketh a
   lie.'

   2. They all violate the natural order and conformity which God hath
   appointed between the heart and the tongue; and though officious lies
   are not for the hurt, but the good of others, yet it is to the hurt and
   prejudice of truth. A man is not to lie for the glory of God, therefore
   certainly not for the good of another man; you hurt your own soul more
   by sin than you can do him good. Augustine, treating of officious lies,
   he tells of one Firmus, who was Firmus nomine, et firmior
   voluntate--Firm by name, but more firm and fixed by will and resolved
   purpose; therefore, when one was pursued for casual homicide, he
   concealed him; and being asked for him, answered, Nec mentiri se posse
   nec hominem prodere--he could neither lie nor betray him. So much for
   the first thing, namely, what is a lie and lying.

   Secondly, For the reasons why the children of God should be far from
   it.

   1. In regard of outward commerce. That which is contrary to human
   society should be odious to the children of God, who, as they are in a
   peculiar sense members one of another, so are also of the same
   political body, and therefore should speak truth one to another,' Eph.
   iv. 25. Human society is mostly upheld by truth. Where there is no
   truth, there can be no trust; where there is no trust, there can be no
   commerce; it makes men unfit to be trusted. When a man hath much
   counterfeit money offered to him in payment, though there may be some
   true gold and silver, yet he casts it away, and suspecteth it all. Men
   that are given to lying can have no credit nor faith with man, so they
   are unfit for human commerce; therefore it should be far from men; nay,
   it is the right of our neighbour that we should speak truth, for speech
   is a kind of traffic and commerce, and therefore it is a kind of theft
   to defraud your neighbour of his right, if you give him false words for
   true. Now, because it is the band and foundation of human society,
   therefore it should be far from the children of God.

   2. It is a perversion of the order of nature. The tongue is the
   interpreter of the mind, and therefore if the interpreter of another
   man speak contrary to what he pronounceth, there were a manifest wrong
   and disorder; so when the tongue speaks otherwise than the man thinks,
   there is a great disturbance and deordination.

   3. We resemble Satan in nothing so much as in lying, and we resemble
   God in nothing so much as in truth. Falsehood is the devil's character:
   John viii. 44, He was a liar from the beginning;' that is, the first
   inventor of lies, as Jubal was the father of them that played upon the
   harp, the first inventor; and herein we most resemble Satan. On the
   contrary, there is nothing wherein a man resembleth God so much as in
   truth. Truth is no small part of the image of God, for he is called the
   God of truth;' and it is said of him, Titus, i. 2, that he cannot lie;'
   it is contrary to the perfection of his nature; nor command us to lie.
   God hath commanded many other things which otherwise were sinful; as to
   kill another man, as Abraham to slay his son; to take away the goods of
   others, as lord of all, as when the Israelites spoiled the Egyptians of
   their jewels; but God cannot lie, it is against his nature: Eph. iv.
   24, 25, Put off the old man, which is corrupt, according to the
   deceitful lusts; and put on the new man, which after God is created in
   righteousness and true holiness.' Then presently, Wherefore put away
   lying; speak every man truth with his neighbour.' Wherefore--that is,
   from your regeneration, when the image of God is planted in you. So the
   same: Col. iii. 9, Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off
   the old man with his deeds.' There may be sin in the children of God,
   but there should be no guile in them. Habituated guile is the old man
   that is deceitful; the new man is framed to truth, and according to the
   will of God.

   4. This is a consideration, that God never dispensed with this precept.
   He hath upon special occasion dispensed with other commands, but never
   with the ninth. With the seventh commandment in the polygamy of the
   patriarchs, and with the second in Hezekiah's passover; but a man must
   not lie for God, Job xiii. 7-9, because this commandment hath more in
   it of the justice and immutable perfection of God than others.

   5. By the light of nature nothing is more odious. We love a just and
   true man, one that is without guile; we acknowledge it as a moral
   perfection. But a lie is counted the greatest disgrace; we revenge the
   charge of it. It is counted a base thing to lie. Why? Because it comes
   from fear, and it tends to deceit, both which argue baseness of spirit,
   and are contrary to the gallantry of a man; therefore it is shameful in
   the eyes of nature, and those that are most guilty of it cannot endure
   to be charged with it. When the prophet Micaiah told Zedekiah of his
   lying spirit, he smote him on the cheek,' 1 Kings xx. 23. So men take
   it ill to be charged with a lie. We count it a shameful sin among men.
   The old Persians had such a great respect to truth, that he that was
   three times taken with a lie was never more to speak in public, upon
   penalty of death.

   6. It is a sin that is most hateful to God; therefore it should be far
   from the children of God. We hate that most which is contrary to our
   nature, so it is contrary to God's nature. There are six things God
   hates, and a lying tongue is one of them; twice it is mentioned, Prov.
   vi. 17, 19, and Prov. xii. 22, Lying lips are an abomination to the
   Lord; but they that deal truly are his delight.' Now certainly because
   God hates it, therefore we should hate it. To will and nill the same
   thing, that is true friendship. God hates it, therefore a righteous man
   hates it: Prov. xiii. 5, A righteous man hateth lying; but a wicked man
   is loathsome, and cometh to shame.'

   7. It is a sin which God hath expressly threatened to punish in this
   life and in the life to come. In this life: Ps. v. 6, Thou shalt
   destroy them that speak leasing;' and Prov. xix. 5, He that speaketh
   lies shall not escape.' God will cut them off as not being fit for
   human society. The first remarkable instance we have in the New
   Testament of God's vengeance was for a lie, Acts v. 5; yea, it is one
   of the sins that draws down public and national judgments; and
   therefore it is said, Hosea iv. 2, By swearing and lying, therefore,
   doth the land mourn.' And when God gives advice to his people how they
   should prevent his judgments, Zech. viii. 16, 17, These are the things
   that ye shall do, speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour:
   execute the judgment of truth; love no false oath: for all these are
   the things that I hate, saith the Lord.' When men have no care of their
   speeches, when a people bind themselves by oaths to do that which they
   mind not to perform, or wilfully do not perform, they are ripe for a
   judgment. And so in the life to come: Rev. xxi. 27, And there shall in
   no wise enter into it anything that defileth, neither whatsoever
   worketh abomination, or maketh a lie;' and Rev. xxi. 8, All liars shall
   have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone;' and
   Rev. xxii. 15, For without are dogs and sorcerers, and whoremongers,
   and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.'

   Use. Oh, then, let us beware of all lying and dissimulation with
   respect to God and men! Let our words consent with our minds, and our
   minds agree with the thing itself. A lie is most odious to God, a proud
   look, and a lying tongue;' and therefore a Christian that loves God,
   shall he do that which God so expressly hates? Will you rush upon the
   pikes, kick against the pricks, and run against the judgments of God? A
   lying tongue shall not escape. Nay, God reckons upon his children: Isa.
   lxiii. 8, Surely they are my people, children that will not lie.'
   Disappointment, that is the worst vexation. God reckons upon it, surely
   you will make conscience of truth, not only in your oaths (certainly
   that is a barbarous thing to break the most sacred engagements that are
   among mankind, therefore you will be careful to perform what you have
   sworn to the Lord with your hands lift up to the Most High God), but
   also in your promises and ordinary speeches. Good men have been foiled
   by it (David begs, Keep me from a way of lying'), and it is a sin more
   common than we imagine; it is very natural to us, Isa. lix. 3. As soon
   as we are born we speak lies; before we could go we went astray, and
   before we were able to speak we spake lies; the seed of it was in our
   nature. It is a sin most natural, for it was the occasion of the first
   sin, and therefore we had need be cautioned against it.

   Consider, there is a lying to God in public and private worship. In
   public worship, how often do you compass him about with lies! We show
   love with our mouths when our heart is at a great distance from God.
   Oh, how odious should we be to ourselves if our heart were turned
   inside outward in the best duty, and all our thoughts were turned into
   words! for in our worship many times we draw near to God with our
   mouths, when our heart is at a great distance. As when their bodies
   were in the wilderness, their hearts were in Egypt; so we prattle words
   without sense and spiritual affection. Nay, in our private worship, we
   confess sin without shame; we pray as if we cared not to be heard.
   Conscience tells us what we should pray for, but our hearts do not go
   out in the matter, and we throw away our prayers as children shoot away
   their arrows, which is a sign we are not so hearty as we should be. We
   give thanks, but without meltings of heart. Custom and natural light
   tell us something must be done in this kind, but how hard a matter it
   is to draw near God with truth of heart?

   Again, would we not be accounted better than we are? Who would be
   thought as ill as he hath cause to think of himself? We storm if others
   but speak of us half of what we speak of ourselves to God; therefore
   ail had need look to it to be kept from a way of lying. And for gross
   lying, how far are we from being willing that should be accomplished
   which the Lord speaks of, Zeph. iii. 13, The remnant of Israel shall
   not do iniquity, nor speak lies, neither shall a deceitful tongue be
   found in their mouth.' Rather we may take up David's complaint, Ps.
   xii. 1, 2, The godly man ceaseth; the faithful fail from among the
   children of men: they speak vanity every one with his neighbour; with
   flattering lips, and with a double heart do they speak.' Promises,
   oaths, covenants all broken; and therefore so many jealousies, because
   so much lying; all trust is lost among us. This lying is always ill,
   but especially in magistrates, men of public place: Prov. xvii. 7,
   Lying lips become not a prince.' So ministers: Rom. ix. 1, I say the
   truth in Christ, I lie not;' 2 Cor. xi. 31, The God and Father of our
   Lord Jesus Christ knoweth that I lie not.' Among private Christians,
   are we not too rash in our suspicions, and speak worse of others than
   they deserve? do we not take up and vent reports without search? it may
   be out of envy at the brightness of their profession. Do not unwary
   expressions drop from us? Much talk cannot be justified. Are there not
   rash promises we make no conscience to mind and look after? Many ways
   may we trace ourselves in this sin of lying; therefore look to the
   prevention of it. What remedies are there against it?

   1. Hate it; do not think it to be a venial matter: Ps. cxix. 163, I
   hate and abhor lying;' not only hate it, nor simply I abhor it, but
   hate and abhor, to strengthen and increase the sense, and make it more
   vehement. Where the enmity is not great against the sin, the matter may
   be compounded and taken up. Oh, but I hate and abhor it, and hate it
   with a deadly hatred! Slight hatred of a sinful course is not
   sufficient to guard us against it.

   2. Love to the law of God; if that be dear to you, you will not break
   it upon any light occasion. In the text, Grant me thy law graciously.'
   If a man prize the laws of God, and would fain have them printed in the
   heart, he will not so easily break them.

   3. Remember your spiritual conflict; you never give Satan so great an
   advantage as by falsehood and guile of spirit. The devil assaults by
   wiles, but your strength lieth in downright honesty: Eph. vi. 11, That
   ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.' Satan's
   strength lies in wiles, but you must beat him down in sincerity. The
   first piece of the spiritual armour is the girdle of truth that is, the
   grace of sincerity, whereby a man is to God and men what he gives out
   himself to be, or seems to be. This is that which will give you
   strength and courage in sore trials. Oh! when Satan shall accuse and
   challenge you for your base hypocrisy, then how will you hold up your
   heads in the day of spiritual conflict, if you have not the girdle of
   truth? But now uprightness gives us courage, strength, and stands by us
   in the very agonies of death.

   4. Heedfulness, and a watch upon the tongue: Ps. xxxix. 1, I aid I will
   take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue.' Let us speak of
   what we think, and think of what we speak, that the mind may conform
   itself with the nature of truth.

   5. Avoid the causes of lying. There are three of them--(1.) Boasting,
   or speaking too much of ourselves. When men are given to boasting,
   whatever thing of weight is done, they were privy to it; their hand was
   in the work, in contriving and prosecuting the business, their counsel
   was for it. Nothing can be acted without their knowledge and
   approbation. This spirit of vainglory is the mother of vain talking,
   therefore of a lying tongue: Ps. xii. 3, Flattering lips,' and the
   tongue that speaketh proud things,' are joined together. (2.) Flattery,
   or desiring of ingratiating themselves with those that are great and
   mighty in the world, when they have men's persons in admiration: Ps.
   xii. 2, With flattering lips, and with a double heart do they speak.'
   So Hosea vii. 3, They make the king glad with their lies.' To please
   their rulers, they soothe them up with flattering applause and fawning
   upon them. (3.) Carnal fear and distrust. This was that which put David
   to his shifts in his dangers; he was apt to fail, and deal a little
   deceitfully in time of temptation and danger. We had need to pray to
   God to be kept from all ways and counsels that are contrary to God's
   word. The scripture speaks, Deut. xxxiii. 29, of counterfeit
   submissions to higher powers: Thine enemies shall be found liars unto
   thee, thou shalt tread upon their high places;' the meaning is, shall
   be subdued by thee. So Ps. xviii. 44, Strangers shall submit themselves
   to me;' Ps. lxvi. 3, lxxxi. 15, and many other places. The word
   implieth feigned submission.

   Object. But are we openly to profess our mind in all things in time of
   danger? I answer--Prudent concealment may be without fault, but a
   professed subjection should be sincere, for open and free dealing doth
   best become God's children. It is true we are not bound to speak all
   the truth at all times to every person. In some cases we may conceal
   something: Luke ix. 21, our Saviour straitly charged them, and
   commanded them to tell nobody that he was the Christ,' 1 Sam. xvi. 2,
   when the Lord sent Samuel to anoint David, Samuel said, How can I go?
   if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And the Lord said, Take an heifer
   with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the Lord;' that was a
   truth, but not the whole truth.

   Object. But you will say, Will not this justify mental reservation and
   Jesuitical equivocation? I answer--There are two sorts of reservations;
   I may reserve part of the truth in my mind. But the mental reservations
   the Jesuits plead for is this--when that which is spoken is a lie, if
   abstracted from that which is in the mind; for instance, if a
   magistrate say, Art thou a priest? No; meaning not after the order of
   Baal. So that which is spoken is a lie. But if it be spoken with truth,
   we may reserve part of it. That in Samuel was not an untruth, but
   concealing some part of the truth not fit to be discovered. So Jer.
   xxxviii. 24-27, Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of
   these words, and thou shalt not die. But if the princes hear that I
   have talked with thee, and they shall come unto thee, and say unto
   thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king, hide it
   not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said
   unto thee: then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication
   before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's
   house to die there. Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked
   him; and he told them according to all these words that the king had
   commanded: so they left off speaking with him, for the matter was not
   perceived.'

   Secondly, We now come to the blessing asked, Grant me thy law
   graciously.' Where first the benefit itself, grant me thy law;
   secondly, the terms upon which it is asked, implied in the word
   graciously.

   The benefit asked, Grant me thy law.' David had the book of the law
   already; every king was to have a copy of it written before him; but he
   understandeth it not of the law written in a book. But of the law
   written upon his heart; which is a privilege of the covenant of grace:
   Heb. viii. 10, For this is the covenant which I will make with the
   house of Israel in those days, saith the Lord: I will put my laws in
   their minds, and write them in their hearts,' &c.

   Doct. 1. Then is the law granted to us when it is written upon our
   minds and hearts; that is, when we understand it, and our hearts are
   framed to the love and obedience of it; otherwise it is only granted to
   the church in general, but it is not granted to us in particular. We
   may have some common privilege of being trained up in the knowledge of
   God's will, but we have not the personal and particular benefits of the
   covenant of grace till we find it imprinted upon our hearts. Well,
   then--

   1. Press God about this, not only to grant his word unto the church,
   but to grant it unto you, unto your persons: To reveal his Son in me,'
   Gal. i. 16. There is a general benefit, He hath showed his word unto
   Jacob, and his statutes unto Israel,' Ps. cxlvii. 19. And there is a
   particular benefit, Grant me thy law graciously.' The whole church may
   be under a covenant of grace, and some particular members of it may be
   all that while under a covenant of works, if they have only an external
   law without to show them what is good, but not a law within to urge and
   enable them to do it--Lex jubet, gratia juvat. Literal instruction
   belongeth only to the first covenant; but when the word is made ours,
   that is a privilege of the second covenant, The ingrafted word that is
   able to save our souls,' James i. 21, when it is received in our
   hearts, and doth prosper there, and fructify unto holiness, when it is
   written over again by the finger of the Spirit.

   2. See if this effect be accomplished, if the law be granted to you. It
   is so--(1.) When you have a sense and conscience of it, and you own it
   as your rule for the governing of your own heart and life: Ps. xxxvii.
   31, The law of God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.' It
   is not in his book only, but in his heart, to guide all his actions.
   (2.) It is so when you have some ability and strength to perform it.
   Their hearts carry them to it: as Ps. lx. 8, I delight to do thy will,
   God; yea, thy law is in my heart.' They have not only a sense and
   conscience of their rule, but a ready spirit to perform it, and set
   about this work cheerfully and heartily. A ready and cheerful obedience
   to God's will is the surest note that the law is given to us; when the
   study and practice of it is the great employment and pleasure of our
   lives.

   Doct. 2. (1.) The law that is odious to the flesh is acceptable to a
   gracious heart. What others count a restraint, they count a great
   benefit and favour: Rom. viii. 7, The carnal mind is enmity against
   God, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.'
   They shun all means of searching and knowing themselves, wishing such
   things were not sins, or not desiring to know them to be so; therefore
   hate the law, and will not come to the light, John iii. 20, For every
   one that doth evil hateth the light; neither cometh to the light, lest
   his deeds should be reproved.' As a man that hath light ware is loath
   to come to the balance, or counterfeit coin to the touchstone, or as a
   bankrupt is loath to cast up his estate. They hate the directions and
   injunctions of the word as contrary to their lusts: 1 Kings xxii. 8, He
   doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil,' said wicked Ahab; and
   therefore would not hear him, and yet he was the prophet of the Lord.
   They are loath to understand their duty, are willingly,' ignorant: 2
   Peter iii. 5, For this they are willingly ignorant of,' &c. But now a
   gracious heart desireth nothing more than the knowledge of God's will;
   how contrary soever to their lusts, they approve it: Rom. vii. 12,
   Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy and just and good.'
   The law and commandment, that which wrought such tragical effects in
   his heart. Therefore they desire the knowledge of it above all things:
   Ps. cxix. 72, The law of thy mouth is better to me than thousands of
   gold and silver,' more than all earthly riches what soever; it is the
   best thing they can enjoy, to have a full direction in obedience. (2.)
   The practice is welcome to their souls: 1 John v. 4, His commandments
   are not grievous.' They are to others, not to them, because of the
   suitableness of their hearts: to a galled shoulder, the least burden is
   irksome, but to a sound back it is nothing; love sweetens all.

   Use. Do you count the law an enemy or a friend? The law is an enemy to
   them that count it an enemy, and a friend to them that count it a
   friend. It is a rule of life to them that delight in it, and count it a
   great mercy to know it, and be subdued to the practice of it; but it is
   a covenant of works to them that withdraw the shoulder, count it a
   heavy burden not to be borne. Well, then, which do you complain of, the
   law or your corruptions? What are you troubled with, light or lusts? A
   gracious heart groaneth not under the strictness of the law, but under
   the body of death; not because God hath required so much, but because
   they can do no more.

   Doct. 3. That the law is granted to us or written upon our hearts out
   of God's mere grace. Grant it graciously, saith David. I will do it,
   saith God; and God will do it upon his own reasons. The conditions of
   the covenant are conditions in the covenant, and the articles that bind
   us are also promises wherein God is bound to bestow so great a benefit
   upon poor creatures; which doth encourage us to wait for this work with
   the more confidence. We are sensible we have not the law so intimately,
   so closely applied as we should have. Lord, grant it graciously. It is
   his work to give us a greater sense and care of it.

SERMON XXXI.

   I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid before
   me.--Ver. 30.

   DAVID asserts his sincerity here in two things:--

   1. In the Tightness of his choice, I have chosen the way of thy truth.

   2. In the accurateness of his prosecution, thy judgments have I laid
   before me.

   First, For his choice, I have chosen the way of thy truth.' God having
   granted him his law, he did reject all false ways of religion, and
   continued in the profession of the truth of God, and the strict
   observance thereof. There are many controversies and doubtful thoughts
   among the sons of men about religion, all being varnished with specious
   pretences, so that a man knows not which way to choose, till by the
   Spirit he be enabled to take the direction of the word; that resolveth
   all his scruples, and makes him sit down in the way which God hath
   pointed for him. Thus David, as an effect of God's grace, avoucheth his
   own choosing the way of truth.

   By the way of truth is meant true religion; as 2 Peter ii. 2, By whom
   the way of truth is evil spoken of.' It is elsewhere called the good
   way wherein we should walk,' 1 Kings viii. 36; and the way of God,' Ps.
   xxvii. 11; and the way of understanding,' Prov. ix. 6; and the way of
   holiness,' Isa. xxxv. 8; and the way of righteousness,' 2 Peter ii. 21,
   Better they had not known the way of righteousness,' that is, never to
   have known the gospel, which is called the way of righteousness. It is
   called also the way of life,' Prov. vi. 23, And reproofs of instruction
   are the way of life;' and the way of salvation,' as Acts xvi. 17, the
   Pythoness gave this testimony to the apostles, These are the servants
   of God, which show unto us the way of salvation.' Now all these
   expressions have their use and significancy; for the way of truth, or
   the true way to happiness, is a good way, showed us by God, who can
   only discover it; and therefore called the way of the Lord,' or the way
   of God,' in the place before quoted; and Acts xxviii. 25, 26, it is
   manifested by God, and leadeth us to God. The Christian doctrine was
   that way of truth revealed by him who is prima veritas, the first
   truth. The ways wherein God cometh to us are his mercy and truth; and
   the way wherein we come to God is the way of true religion prescribed
   by him; it is the way of understanding, because it maketh us wise as to
   the great affairs of our souls, and unto the end of our lives and
   beings; and the way of holiness and righteousness, as directing us in
   all duties to God and man; and the way of life and salvation, because
   it brings us to everlasting happiness. This way David chose by the
   direction of God's word and Spirit.

   Secondly, There follows the evidence of his sincerity, the accurate
   prosecution of his choice, Thy judgments have I laid before me.' The
   Septuagint reads it, I have not forgotten thy judgments.' By judgments
   is meant God's word, according to the sentence of which every man shall
   receive his doom. He that walketh in a way condemned by the word shall
   not prosper; for God's word is judgment, and execution shall surely
   follow; and by this word David got his direction how to choose this way
   of truth, and this he laid before him as his line. His desire was to
   follow what was right and true, not only as to his general course and
   way of profession, but in all his actions; and so it noteth his fixed
   purpose to live according to this blessed rule which God hath given
   him. To have a holy rule and an unholy life is unconsonant,
   inconsistent. A Christian should be a lively transcript of that
   religion he doth profess. If the way be a way of truth, he must always
   set it before him, and walk exactly.

   The points are two:--

   1. That there being many crooked paths in the world, it concerns us to
   choose the way of truth.

   2. That when we have chosen the way of truth, or taken up the
   profession of the true religion, the rules and institutions of it
   should ever be before us.

   There are two great faults of men--one in point of choice, the other in
   point of pursuit. Either they do not choose right, or they do not live
   up to the rules of their profession. Both are prevented by these
   points.

   Doct. 1. That there being many crooked paths in the world, it concerns
   us to choose the way of truth.

   I shall give you the sense of it in these eight propositions or
   considerations.

   Prop. 1. The Lord in his holy providence hath so permitted it that
   there ever have been, and are, and, for aught we can see, will be,
   controversies about the way of truth and right worship. There was such
   a disease introduced into the world by the fall, that most of the
   remedies which men choose do but show the strength and malignity of the
   disease. They choose out false ways of corning to God and returning to
   him: Micah iv. 5, All people will walk every one in the name of his
   god; and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and
   ever,' Mark, there is his God, and our God, and then all people, noting
   their common agreement in error; all people will, every man, noting
   their diversity as to the particular false way of religion and worship
   which they take up to themselves. When they turn their back upon the
   true God, and the knowledge of him, then they are endless in seeking
   out false gods: Jonah i. 5, They cried every man to his god.' Among
   pagans, even in one ship, there were many false gods worshipped.

   The controversy about religion mainly lay at first between the Jews and
   the pagans. The pagans had their gods, and the Jews had the Lord God of
   Israel, the only true God. Yea, among the pagans themselves there was a
   great diversity--every man will walk'--and sometimes a hot contention;
   and many times there were hot contests, which was the better god, the
   leek or the garlic. When religion, which restrains our passions, is
   made the fuel of them, and instead of a judge becomes a party, men give
   themselves up headlong to all manner of bitter zeal and strife; and
   persuasion of truth and right, which doth calm men in other
   differences, are here inflamed by that bitter zeal every one hath for
   his god, his service and party; and the difference is greater
   especially between the two dissenting parties that come nearest to one
   another.

   We read afterward, when this difference lay more closely between the
   Jews and the Samaritans, and Christ decides, that salvation was of the
   Jews. The Jews were certainly the better party: John iv. 20, Our
   fathers worshipped in this mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is
   the place where men ought to worship'--Mount Sion, or Mount Gerizim,
   which was the temple of the true God, one or the other? Then we read
   afterward among the Jews themselves in their private sects, who were
   very keen against each other, Pharisees and Sadducees; and Paul, though
   an enemy to them both, and was looked upon as a common adversary, yet
   they had rather join with him than among themselves, Acts xxiii. 8, 9.
   Afterward you find the scene of contention lay between the Jews and
   Christians: Acts xiv. 4, But the multitude of the city was divided; and
   part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.' There it grew
   into an open contest and quarrel.

   And then between the Christians and the pagans, which was the occasion
   of that uproar at Ephesus, Acts xix. Ay! and after religion had gotten
   ground, and the way of truth had prevailed in the world, then the
   difference lay betwixt Christians themselves; yea, while religion was
   but getting up, between the followers of the apostles and the school
   and sect of Simon Magus, those impure libertines and Gnostics who went
   out of them because they were not of them, 1 John ii. 19. And afterward
   in the church story we read of the contentions between the Catholics
   and the Arians, the Catholics and the Pelagians, the Catholics and the
   Donatists, and other sects.

   And now, last of all in the dregs of time, between the Protestants and
   the Papists, that settled party with whom the church of God is now in
   suit. As the rod of Aaron did devour the rods of the enchanters, so the
   word of God, which is the rod of his strength, doth and will in time
   eat up and consume all untruths whatsoever; but for a great while the
   contests may be very hot and sharp. Yea, among those that profess a
   reformed Christianity, there are the Lutherans and the Calvinists.

   And nearer to us, I will not so much as mention those invidious names
   and flags of defiance which are set up, under which different parties
   do encamp at home. Thus there ever have been, and will be, contests
   about religion and disputes about the way of truth; yea, different
   opinions in the church, and among Christians themselves, about divine
   truths revealed in the scripture.

   The Lord permits this in his holy and righteous providence, that the
   godly may be stirred up more to embrace truth upon evidence with more
   affection, that they may more encourage and strengthen themselves and
   resolve for God; for when all people will walk every one in the name of
   his god, we will walk in the name of our God for ever," Micah iv. 5.
   And the Lord doth it that he may manifest the sincere, that when Christ
   calls, Who is on my side? who are willing to stick to him whatever
   hazards and losses they may incur: 1 Cor. xi. 19, There must be
   heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest
   among you.' Ay! and that there may be a ready plague of strong delusion
   and lies for them that receive not the truth in the love of it, 2 Thes.
   ii. 11, 12; for damnable errors are the dungeons in which God holds
   carnal souls that play the wanton, and trifle with his truth, and never
   admit the love and power of it to come into their hearts.

   Prop. 2. True religion is but one, and all other ways false, noxious,
   and pestilent: Eph. iv. 5, One Lord, one faith, one baptism.' There are
   many ways in the world, but there is but one good and certain way that
   leads to salvation. So much the apostle intimates when he saith, He
   will have all men to be saved.' How would he have them saved? 1 Tim.
   ii. 4, For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the
   man Christ Jesus;' which text implies that salvation is by the
   knowledge of the truth, or knowledge of the true way; others tend to
   destruction. And so God promiseth, Jer. xxxii. 39, that he will give
   all the elect one heart and one way.' Though there be differences even
   in the church of God about lesser truths, yet there is but one true
   religion in the essence and substance of it; I mean, as to those truths
   which are absolutely necessary to salvation. To make many doors to
   heaven is to set wide open the gates of hell. Many men think that men
   of all religions shall be saved, provided they be of a good life, and
   walk according to their light.

   In these later times divers unsober questionists are grown weary of the
   Christian religion, and by an excess of charity would betray their
   faith; and while they plead for the salvation of Turks and heathens,
   scarce show themselves good Christians. The Christian religion is not
   only the most compendious way to true happiness, but it is the only
   way: John xvii. 3, This is life eternal, to know thee the only true
   God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.' There is the sum of what is
   necessary to life eternal; that there is one God, Father, Son, and Holy
   Ghost, to be known, loved, obeyed, worshipped, and enjoyed; and the
   Lord Jesus Christ to be owned as our Redeemer and Saviour, to bring us
   home to God, and to procure for us the gifts of pardon and life; and
   this life to be begun here by the Spirit, and to be perfected in
   heaven. This is the sum of all that can be said that is necessary to
   salvation. Certainly none can be saved without Christ; for there is no
   other name under heaven whereby we can be saved but by Jesus Christ,'
   Acts iv. 12, and none can be saved by Christ but they that know him and
   believe in him.

   If God hath extraordinary ways to reveal Christ to men, we know not.
   This is our rule; no adults, no grown persons can be saved but they
   that know him and believe in him. And now Christ hath been so long
   owned in the world, and his knowledge so far propagated, why should we
   dream of any other way of salvation? To us there is but one God and one
   faith. The good-fellow gods of the heathen could brook company and
   partnership, but the true God will be alone acknowledged. As the sun
   drowns the light of all the stars, so God will shine alone. No man can
   be saved without these two things--without a fixed intention of God as
   his last end, and a choice of Jesus Christ as the only way and means of
   attaining thereunto.

   These things are set down in scripture as of infallible necessity to
   salvation; and therefore, though there be several apprehensions and
   contentions about ways of salvation and righteousness, yet there is but
   one true religion, and all other ways are false.

   Prop. 3. As soon as any begin to be serious, they begin to have a
   conscience about the finding out this one only true way wherein they
   may be saved. Alas! before men take up that religion which the chance
   of their education offers, without examination or any serious reason of
   their choice, they walk, in the language of the prophet, according to
   the trade of Israel;' they live as they are born and bred, and take up
   truth and error as their faction leads them; or else pass from one
   religion to another, as a man changeth his room or bed, and make a
   slight thing of opinions, and float up and down like light chaff, in a
   various uncertainty, according as their company or the posture of their
   interest is changed. But a serious and awakened conscience will be
   careful to lay the groundwork of religion sure; they build for
   eternity, therefore the foundation needs to be well laid. The woman of
   Samaria, as soon as she was touched at heart and began to have a
   conscience, she began also to have doubtful thoughts about her estate
   and religion. Christ had convinced her of living in adultery, by that
   means to bring her to God; but now she would fain know the true way of
   worship: John iv. 20, Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and ye
   say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.' They
   that have a sense of eternity upon them will be diligent to know the
   right way. The same errand brought Nicodemus to Christ: John iii. 2,
   Master, we know that thou art a teacher come from God.' He would fain
   know how he might come to God. So the young nobleman in the gospel:
   Mat. xix. 16, Good master, what good thing shall I do that I might have
   eternal life?' Though he disliked the bargain afterwards, yet he
   cheapens it, and asks what way he must take. For a great while persons
   have only a memorative knowledge, some apprehension which doth furnish
   their talk about religion; and after their memory is planted with
   notions, then they are without judgment and conscience; but when they
   begin to have a judgment and a conscience, then it is their business to
   make religion sure, and to be upon stable terms with God.

   Prop. 4. When we begin to have a conscience about the true way, we must
   inquire into the grounds and reasons of it, that we may resolve upon
   evidence, not take it up because it is commonly believed, but because
   it is certainly true; not take it up by chance, but by choice; not
   because we know no other, but because we know no better. It is not
   enough to stumble upon truth blindly, but we must receive it knowingly,
   and upon solid conviction of the excellency of it, comparing doctrine
   with doctrine, and thing with thing, and the weak grounds the
   adversaries of the truth have to build upon. The precepts of the word
   are direct and plain for this: 1 Thes. v. 21, Prove all things, hold
   fast that which is good;' and 1 John iv. 1, Try the spirits whether
   they are of God.' There must be trying and searching, and not taking up
   our religion merely by the dictates of another. The papists are against
   this, which argueth a distrust of their own doctrine; they will not
   come to the waters of jealousy, lest their belly should swell and their
   thigh rot. They dare not admit people to trial and choice, and give
   them liberty to search the scriptures; whereas truth is not afraid of
   contradiction: they first put out the light, then would have men shut
   their eyes. But what do they allege, since we are bidden to prove all
   things, and to try the spirits? That these places belong to the doctors
   of the church, and not to the people. But that exception is frivolous,
   because the apostolical epistles were directed to the body of the
   people; and they who are advised to prove all things are such as are
   charged to respect those that are over them in the Lord,' ver. 12, and
   not to despise prophecies,' ver. 20, and then prove all things,' ver.
   21; and in another place, those that he calls paidi'a, little
   children,' them he adviseth to try the spirits; all that have a care of
   their salvation should thus do. Eusebius doth mention it as one of the
   errors of Apelles, that what he had taught them they should not pry
   into and examine, but take it and swallow it. And Mahomet forbids his
   followers to inquire into their religion.

   Object. But is every private Christian bound to study controversy, so
   as to be able to answer all the adversaries of the truth?

   I answer--No; it is a special gift, bestowed and required of some that
   have leisure and abilities, and it is a duty required of ministers and
   church guides to convince gainsayers and stop their mouths. Ministers
   must be able to hold fast the truth. The word is, Titus, i. 9,
   antechomenon, holding fast the faithful word;' it signifies, holding
   fast a thing which another would wrest from us. We should be good at
   holding and drawing, to preserve the truth when others would take it
   out of our hands; otherwise he tells us, Rom. xiv. 1, Him that is weak
   in faith receive, but not to doubtful disputations.' Yet every true
   Christian is so far to be settled in the true religion, and study the
   grounds of it, that he may be fully persuaded in his own mind, Rom.
   xiv. 5, and may not be like chaff, but may be at a certainty in the way
   of truth. Surely the business is worthy our serious care. Eternal life
   and death are not trifles; therefore be not rash in this, but go upon
   sure evidence.

   1. The providence of God doth necessitate us to such a course. Because
   there are different ways propounded to man, therefore he must follow
   all, or take up one upon evidence. Not only in point of practice, as
   life and death is set before us, Deut. xxx. 15, and the broad way and
   the narrow, Mat. vii. 13, 14; not only to counterwork the rebellions of
   the flesh, and the way of wisdom and folly, Prov. ix. No; but in
   matters of opinion and controversy about religion there will meet us
   several ways, Jer. vi. 16, and all pretending to God.

   Therefore what should we do but search, pray, resolve to be thus with
   God, and take the way God will direct us? As the king of Babylon stood
   at the parting of the way, or at the head of the ways, to make
   divination, Ezek. xxi. 21, so you meet with partings of ways that you
   need deliberate to make a wise choice; therefore the providence of God
   doth put you upon trial. Think, there are false teachers; ay, and the
   most holy and upright men are but in part enlightened, and they may
   lead you into a crooked path and a byway; they may mislead us;
   therefore we ought to see with our own eyes.

   2. Consider the sad consequence of erring. There are damnable errors
   and heresies, 2 Peter ii. 1. Vice is not only destructive and damnable
   to the soul, but error. Now eternal damnation and salvation are no
   small matters. A man cannot please God in a false belief, how laudable
   so ever his life be; and they cannot put the fault upon others, that
   they are misled by them; for if the blind lead the blind, both fall
   into the ditch;' not only the blind guide, but the blind follower.

   3. If we light upon a good way without search and choice, it is but a
   happy mistake when we have not sufficient evidence. You may have the
   advantage ground, by chance may light upon a better way, and it is
   God's providence you are born there where it may be so. A Turk hath the
   same ground for his respect to Mahomet that many have for their owning
   of Christ; it is that religion he was born and bred in. This will not
   be counted faith, but simple credulity: The simple believeth every
   word.' It is almost as dangerous to love a truth ignorantly as to
   broach an error knowingly. Temere creditur, &c., saith Tertullian--that
   is believed in vain which is believed without the grounds whereupon it
   is propounded. The faith of Christians should not be conjectural or
   traditional. If a man should not have reasons to sway his choice, he
   will never be able to check temptations even in practical things. If
   men have not received religion upon true grounds, and, as Cyprian
   saith, when they do not look into the reason of these things, and when
   the Christian religion is represented to them without evidence and
   certainty, they have but a probable faith, that is always weak against
   temptation, either against lusts within or errors and seductions
   without; therefore we had need look to the grounds of these things.

   4. The profit is exceeding great, for truth will have a greater force
   upon the heart when we see the grounds and reasons of it. We are
   exposed here in this lower world to great difficulties and temptations.
   Now, when we do not lay up the supreme truths of religion with
   certainty and assurance, alas! these temptations will prevail over us
   and carry us away. Atheism lies at the root; therefore are there such
   doubtings in the heart in point of comfort, such defects in the life
   and conversation, because truth was never soundly laid in the soul, it
   was not chosen. If we were soundly settled in the belief of the unity
   of the divine essence, and the verity of salvation by Christ, and the
   divine authority of the scriptures, and the certainty of the promises
   therein, certainly we would be more firmly engaged to God; comfort
   would sooner follow us, and we would have better success in the
   heavenly life. If the fire were well kindled, it would of itself break
   out into a flame. If we did believe, indeed, that Jesus the Son of God
   hath done so much for us, and had this firmly settled in our hearts,
   this would be a real ground of comfort and constancy: 2 Peter iii. 17,
   Beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall
   from your own steadfastness.' It is put in opposition to one that
   stands by the steadfastness of another; he might be carried away by the
   error of the wicked. No; but he must have somewhat to say to engage his
   own heart, otherwise he is led thereby with every fond suggestion and
   simple credulity, and easily abused. But when men have chosen and are
   well fixed, they are not easily shaken. When men take up religion upon
   trust, without a satisfying argument, they are like light chaff,
   carried through the whole compass of the winds; as mariners dispose of
   several winds which blow in the corners of the world into a circle and
   compass (the apostle's word alludes to that), We are carried all round
   the points of the compass,' Eph. iv. 14. When the chain of consent is
   broken, they are in continual danger to be seduced; and the greatest
   adversaries of truth are able to use such reasons as have in them great
   probability to captivate the affections of a weak understanding, by
   their sophistical arguments and insinuating persuasions.

   Prop. 5. After this inquiry into the grounds and reasons of the way of
   truth, then we must resolve and choose it, I have chosen the way of
   truth,' as the way wherein we are to walk: Jer. vi. 16, Ask where is
   the good way, and walk therein, and then ye shall find rest for your
   souls.' You must not only so understand and form your opinions aright,
   not only see what is the good way, but walk therein; keep that way
   which you find to be the way of truth, renouncing all others. We should
   not lie under a floating uncertainty or sceptical irresolution, as
   those that keep themselves in a wary reservation, that are ever
   learning, but never come to the knowledge of the truth,' 2 Tim. iii.
   7--epignosin aletheias, the word is, they do not come to the
   acknowledgment of the truth;' always examining, but never resolve. You
   are to 1 prove all things,' but not in order to unsettlement, but
   settlement, 1 Thes. v. 21. Consider, inquire, where is God's presence
   most? where is the Son like to be glorified, and souls better to be
   satisfied, and built up in the faith of Jesus Christ? and resolve and
   stick there.

   Prop. 6. That no religion will be found fit to be chosen upon sound
   evidence but the Christian. How shall I be persuaded of this? Why, that
   religion which God hath revealed, that religion which suits with the
   ends of a religion, that is, with the inward necessities of mankind,
   and most commodiously provides for man, that is true religion. Surely
   the necessities of mankind are to be relieved thereby. The great ends
   of a religion are God's glory and our happiness. God is glorified by a
   return of the obedience of the creature, and man is made happy by the
   enjoyment of God. All these ends are advanced by this way of truth.

   First, That is the only religion which is revealed by God, for
   certainly so must a religion be if it be true; for that which pleaseth
   him must be according to his will; and who can know his will but by his
   own revelation, by some sign whereby God hath discovered it to us?
   Alas! if men were to sit brooding a religion themselves, what a strange
   business would they hatch and bring forth! If they were to carve out
   the worship of God, they might please themselves, but could never
   please God. Vain men indeed are ready to frame God like themselves, and
   foolishly imagine what pleaseth them pleaseth him also; they still
   conceive of God according to their own fancy. And this was the reason
   why the wisest heathens, having no revelation, no sense of God's will
   but what offered itself by the light of nature, they would employ their
   wits to devise a religion. But what a monstrous chimera and strange
   fancy did they bring forth!' Professing themselves wise, they became
   fools.' Rom. i. 22. Though they knew there was a great and eternal
   being by the light of nature, yet the apostle saith they became vain,
   en tois dialogismois, in their imaginations, how this infinite being
   should be worshipped; therefore what they carved out was not an honour,
   but a disgrace; they devised gods and goddesses that were patrons of
   murder, theft, and all manner of filthiness, and brought out Bacchus,
   the god of riot and good-fellowship, or the patron of boon companions,
   and Venus, the patroness of love and wantonness. But now God hath
   showed us his will, He hath showed us what is good, and what he doth
   require of us,' Micah vi. 8. Now that the gospel is a revelation from
   God, appears by the matter, which is so suitable to the nature of God;
   it hath such an impress of God's wisdom, goodness, power upon it, that
   plainly it hath passed God; it is like such an infinite and eternal
   being as God is, in the worship and duties prescribed; it is far above
   the wisdom of mere man, though very agreeable to those relics of wisdom
   which are left in us. So that this is that true religion which surely
   will please God, because it came from him at first, and could come from
   no other. And also besides the evidence it carrieth with it, and the
   impress and stamp of God upon it, we have the word of those that
   brought this doctrine to us; and if we had nothing else, if they say,
   Thus saith the Lord,' &c., we are bound to believe them, they being
   persons of a valuable credit, that sought not themselves, but the glory
   of him that sent them. When the first messengers of it were men of such
   an unquestionable credit, that had no ends of their own, but ran all
   the extreme hazards and displeasures, surely it cannot incline us to
   think they did seek God's glory by a lie. Yea, they did evidence their
   mission from God by miracles that God sent them. Surely this doctrine
   is from heaven. Ay, and still God in his providence shows it from
   heaven, both in his internal government of the world; he blesseth it to
   the comfort of the conscience or to the terrifying of the conscience,
   for it works both ways. Wicked men are afraid of the light, lest their
   deeds should be made manifest, John iii. 20;--and also to the
   comforting and settling the conscience, that we may have great joy by
   believing in Christ. This for his internal government. And then his
   external government, by answering of prayers, fulfilling promises,
   accomplishing prophecies: Ps. xviii. 30, As for God, his way is
   perfect; the word of the Lord is tried: he is a buckler to all that
   trust in him.' Put God to the trial by a regular confidence in a humble
   walking, and he will make good his promises; ay, and make good his
   threatenings. When people are ripe for judgment, God will fulfil the
   threatenings of his word, and will accomplish what is spoken by the
   prophets and apostles; and God will reveal his wrath from heaven
   against all un righteousness of men.' Rom. i. 18. So that here are
   plain signs that this is a doctrine revealed from God, and God can best
   tell us how he is to be worshipped and pleased.

   Secondly, Besides God's revelation, it notably performs all that which
   a man would expect in a religion, and so suits the necessities of man
   as well as the honour of God. Why?

   1. That is the true religion, which doth most draw off the minds of men
   from things temporal and earthly to things celestial and eternal, that
   we may think of them and prosecute them. The sense of another world, an
   estate to come, is the great foundation upon which all religion is
   grounded. All its precepts and promises, which are like to gain upon
   the heart of man, they receive their force from the promise of an
   unseen glory, and eternal punishments which are provided for the wicked
   and contemners of the gospel. The whole design of this religion is to
   take us off from the pleasures of the flesh and the baits of this
   world, that we may see things to come. It is the excellency of the
   Christian faith that it reveals the doctrines of eternal life clearly,
   which all other religions in the world only could guess at. There were
   some guesses, but still great uncertainty, but obscure thoughts and
   apprehensions of such an estate. But here life and immortality are
   brought to light through the gospel,' 2 Tim. i. 10. Alas! there is a
   mist upon it in all other representations; they seem to see it, yet see
   it not. But this is brought to light in the gospel; it makes a free
   offer of it, upon condition of faith in Christ, John iii. 16. It
   quickens us to look after it; all its design is to breed in man this
   noble spirit, by looking upon things that are above, and not upon
   things on earth,' Col. iii. 1, 2; and it endeavours, with great power
   and persuasiveness, that we may make it our scope, that we may neglect
   all present advantages rather than miss this; and make it our great
   design that we may look not to the things which are seen, but to the
   things unseen,' 2 Cor. iv. 17, 18. This is the way of truth, because we
   believe it will make the worshippers of it everlastingly happy, which
   all men by nature have inquired about. Now it is but reason that a
   man's work be ended before he receive his wages, and if God will reward
   the virtuous, that it should be in the other world; for our work is not
   ended until we die; and we have a presagency of another world: there is
   another world which the soul of man thinks of. Now this is that which
   Christianity drives at, that we may look after our reward with God, and
   escape that tribulation, wrath, and anguish, which shall come upon
   every soul that doeth evil.

   2. That doctrine which established purity of heart and life, as the
   only means to attain this blessedness, certainly that is the way of
   truth: Ps. xxiv. 3, 4, Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? and
   who shall stand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands and a pure
   heart, who hath not lift up his soul unto vanity.' There is no true
   holiness, no subjection of heart to God, but by the Christian doctrine:
   John xvii. 17, Sanctify them by thy truth; thy word is truth.' Hereby
   we know the word of God is truth, because it is so powerful to
   sanctification: Ps. cxix. 140, Thy word is very pure, therefore thy
   servant loveth it.' All religious endeavour some kind of excellency;
   but now the holiness that is recommended in other religions is a mere
   outside holiness in comparison of what Christianity calls for. We have
   a strict rule, high, patterns, blessed encouragement; it promiseth a
   powerful Spirit, even the Spirit of the holy God, to work our heart to
   this holiness that is required. The aim of that religion is to remedy
   the disease introduced by the fall. All other religions do but make up
   a part of the disease, and the gospel is the only remedy and cure;
   therefore this is the way of truth you should choose.

   3. That doctrine which provideth for peace of conscience, and freedom
   from perplexing fears, which are wont to haunt us by reason of God's
   justice and wrath for our former misdeeds, that doctrine hath the true
   effect of a religion. Man easily apprehends himself as God's creature;
   and being God's creature, he is his subject, bound to obey him; and
   having exceedingly failed in his obedience (as experience shows), he is
   much haunted with fears and doubts. Now that is the religion that, in a
   kindly manner, doth dispossess us of these dreads and fears, and comes
   in upon the soul to deliver us from our bondage, and those guilty fears
   which are so natural to us by reason of sin. And therefore in a
   consultation about religion, if I were to choose, and had not by the
   grace of God been baptized into the Christian faith, and had the
   advantage to look abroad and consider, then I would bethink myself,
   Where shall I find rest for my soul, and from those fears which lie at
   the bottom of conscience, and are easily stirred in us, and sometimes
   are very raging? There is a fire smothering within, and many times it
   is blown up into a flame; where shall I get remedy for these fears? I
   rather pitch upon this, because the Holy Ghost doth, Jer. vi. 16, &c.,
   as if he had said, If you will know what is the good way, take that way
   where you may find rest for your souls; not a false rest that is easily
   disturbed, not a carnal security, but where you may find true solid
   peace; that when you are most serious, and mind your great errand and
   business, you may comfort yourselves, and rejoice in the God that made
   you. In a false way of religion there is no establishment of heart and
   sound peace: Heb. ix. 9, They could not make him that did the service
   perfect as pertaining to the conscience.' That certainly is the true
   religion which makes the worshipper perfect as to the conscience, which
   gives him a well-tempered peace in his soul; not a sinful security, but
   a holy solid peace, that when he hath a great sense of his duty upon
   him, yet he can comfortably wait upon God. And you know our Lord
   himself useth this very motive to invite men: Mat. xi. 29, Come unto me
   all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest;' that
   is, take the Christian religion, that easy yoke upon you, and you shall
   find rest for your souls. The Lord Jesus is our peace, and the ground
   of our peace; but we never find rest until we come under his yoke.
   Christians, search where you will, there is no serious answer to that
   grand question, which is the great scruple of the fallen creature,
   Micah vi. 7, how to appease angry justice. And we are told of those
   locusts who are seducing spirits, which come out of the bottomless pit,
   Rev. ix.; they had stings in their tails; their doctrine is not soundly
   comfortable to the conscience. Among others, this is designed by those
   locusts, that half Christianity which is taken up by the light-skirted
   people, which reflect upon privileges only; therefore there are such
   scruples and intricate debates. But some advantage there is, and some
   progress they may make in the spiritual life, that cry up them without
   duties; but they never have found peace upon their souls unless the
   Lord pardon their mistakes, and doth sanctify their reflections upon
   those spiritual and unseen privileges, so as to check their opposite
   desires and inclinations. It is best to be settled in God's way, by
   justification and sanctification. There is a wound wherein no plaster
   will serve for the cure, but the way the gospel doth take. Consider
   altogether Christ's renewing and reconciling grace, the whole
   evangelical truth, this gospel which was founded in the blood of
   Christ, his new covenant, and sealed with God's authority, and doth so
   fitly state duties and privileges, and lead a man by the one to the
   other. This is that which will appease the Lord. There is no settling
   of the conscience without it; and therefore, whatever you would expect
   in a religion, here you find it in that blessed religion which is
   recommended to us in the gospel or new covenant; there is such holiness
   and true sense of the other world, which breeds an excellency and
   choiceness of spirit in men.

   Prop. 7. Of all sects and sorts among Christians, the Protestant
   reformed religion will be found to be the way of truth. Why? Be cause
   there is the greatest suitableness to the great ends, the greatest
   agreement and harmony with God's revelation, which they profess to be
   their only rule. I say, as to God's worship, there is most simplicity,
   without that theatrical pomp which makes the worship of God a dead
   thing, and so most suitable to a spiritual being, and conducible to
   spiritual ends, to God who is a Spirit, and who will be worshipped in
   spirit and truth; for there God is our reward, and to be served by
   faith, love, obedience, trust, prayers, praises, and a holy
   administration of the word and seals; more suitable to the genius of
   the scripture, without the pageantry of numerous idle ceremonies, like
   flourishes about a great letter, which do rather hide religion than any
   way discover it; yea, betray it to contempt and scorn to a considering
   man. Besides, the great design of this religion is to draw men from
   earth to heaven, by calling them to a serious profession of saving
   truth. Popery is nothing but Christianity abused, and is a doctrine
   suited to policy and temporal ends; and it is supported by worldly
   greatness. Arid then as to holiness, which is the genuine product of a
   religion, the true genuine holiness is to be found, or should be found
   according to their principles, among Protestants and reformed; not
   external mortification, but in purging the heart. And here is the true
   peace of conscience, while men are directed to look to Christ's
   reconciling and renewing grace, and not to seek their acceptance in the
   merit of their own works, and voluntary penance and satisfactions, and
   many other doctrines which put the conscience upon the rack. And then
   all this is submitted to be tried by the scriptures, which apparently
   are acknowledged by them to be the word, without running to unwritten
   traditions and the authority of men. Again, all this is recommended
   with the special presence of God as to gifts and graces, blessing these
   churches continually more and more. Therefore, if ever a man will find
   rest for his soul, and be soundly quiet within himself, here he must
   fix and choose, and take up the way of truth. Popery is but heathen ism
   disguised with a Christian name: their penal satisfactions are like the
   gashing and lancing of Baal's priests; their mediators of intercession
   are like the doctrines of demons among the Gentiles, for they had their
   middle powers, glorified heroes; their holy water suits with the
   heathen lustrations; their costly offerings to their images answer to
   the sacrifices and oblations to appease their gods, which the idolaters
   would give for the sin of their souls; adoring their relics is like the
   respects the heathens had to their departed heroes; and as they had
   their tutelar gods for every city, so these their saints for every city
   and nation; their St Sebastian for the pestilence, their Apollonia for
   the toothache, and the like. It is easy to rake in this dirt. It was
   not for the devil's interest, when the ensign of the gospel was lifted
   up, to draw men to downright heathenism; therefore he did more secretly
   mingle the customs and superstitions of the Gentiles with the food of
   life, like poison conveyed in perfume, that the souls of men might be
   more infected, alienated, and drawn from God. Popery doth not only add
   to the true religion, but destroys it, and is contrary to it. Let any
   considering man, that is not prejudiced, compare the face of the Roman
   synagogue with the beauty of the reformed churches, and they will see
   where Christianity lies. There you will find another sacrifice for
   expiation of sin than the death of Christ; the communion of the cup, so
   expressly commanded in the word of God, taken away from the people;
   reading the scriptures forbidden to laics, as if the word of God were a
   dangerous book; prayers in an un known language; images set up, and so
   they are guilty, if not of primitive idolatry (which all the water in
   the sea cannot wash them clear of), yet certainly of secondary
   idolatry, which is the setting up an idol in God's worship contrary to
   the second commandment, the image of the invisible God represented by
   stones and pictures; invocation of saints and angels allowed; the
   doctrine of transubstantiation, contrary to the end of the sacrament;
   works of supererogation; popes' pardons; purgatory for faults already
   committed, as if Christ had not already satisfied; papal infallibility,
   not only contrary to faith, but sense and reason; their ridiculous mass
   and ceremonies; and many such human inventions, besides the word and
   against it. But the Protestants are contented with the simplicity of
   the scriptures, the word of God, and the true sacraments of Christ.
   Therefore you see what is the way of truth we should stick to.

   Prop. 8. That in the private differences among the professors of the
   reformed Protestant religion, a man is to choose the best way, but to
   hold charity towards dissenters. In the true church, in matters of
   lesser moment, there may be sundry differences; for until men have the
   same degree of light, it cannot be expected they should be all of a
   mind. Babes will think one thing, grown persons will have other
   apprehensions; sick persons will have their frenzies and doubtings,
   which the sound cannot like. The apostle's rule is, Phil. iii. 15, 16,
   Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded; and if in
   anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you,'
   &c. There are two parts of that rule. The perfect must be thus minded;
   they that are fully instructed in the mind of God, they must practise
   as they believe. Strings in tune must not be brought down to those that
   are out of tune. But if others tainted with error do not give a
   thorough assent to all divine truth, yet let us walk together, saith
   the apostle, so far as we are agreed. God, that hath begun to enlighten
   them in other things, will in time discover their mistakes. Thus far
   the true Christian charity takes place. This should be our rule. Here
   we are agreed in the Christian reformed religion, and in all the points
   of it; let us walk together so far, and in lesser differences let us
   bear with and forbear one another in love. I speak now of Christian
   toleration; for the magistrate's toleration and forbearance, how far he
   is to interpose, that is another case: Eph. iv. 2, With all lowliness
   and meekness, with long-suffering forbearing one another in love.' What
   is bearing with one another? Not conniving at their sin, or neglecting
   ways to reclaim them; or forbear our profession when God calls us to
   it--they are great cases how far profession may be suspended, and how
   far it may be carried on--but to restore them with meekness; to own
   them in those things wherein they are owned by God; not to practise
   that antichristian humour which is now gotten into Protestantism, of
   unchurching, unministering, unchristianising one another, but to own
   one another in all those things wherein we are agreed, without imposing
   or censuring; not rending into factions, not endeavouring to destroy
   all, that we may promote the particular interest of one party to the
   prejudice of the whole; but walking under one common rule. And if
   others shall prove peevish, and if angry brethren shall call us
   bastards, and disclaim us as not belonging to the same father, we ought
   not to reject them, but still call them brethren; if they will not join
   with us we cannot help it, yet they are brethren notwithstanding that
   disclaim; and how pettishly and frowardly soever they carry themselves
   in their differences, a good Christian should take up this resolution
   (their tongue is not Christ's fan to purge his floor), though they may
   condemn things which Christ will own, to bear their reproofs, and love
   them still; for the iniquity of their carriage doth not take away our
   obligation to them. As in the relation of inferiors, we are bound to be
   obedient to the froward as well as to the gentle parents and masters;
   so in the duties that are to pass between equals, we are to bear with
   the froward and to overcome their inclinations. For though we have
   corruptions that are apt to alienate us, and will put us upon furious
   passions, uncomely heats and divisions, yet God forbid we should omit
   any part of our duty to them, for uncharitable brethren are brethren
   still.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON XXXII

   I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid before
   me.--Ver. 30.

   I come now to answer an objection which may be made.

   Object. But if you be so earnest to maintain unity among your own
   sects, why do you separate from the Papists, who are Christians as well
   as you, and own many things of Christianity wherein you may agree with
   them?

   I answer--In the general, certainly the separation of one Christian,
   from another is a great evil, which should be carefully avoided; and if
   walls of separation be set up by others, yet we must do what in us lies
   to demolish them. They do no service to Christ that make separations
   needlessly, when as much as is possible there should be a union and
   coalition between Christians. Now, what shall we say to this separation
   from Borne, who were in the possession of a Christianity? I tell you,
   this bugbear needs not fright us out of the good way, if we can but
   clear three things to you.

   1. That as to the rise, it was neither unjust nor unnecessary.

   2. As to the manner of it, it was not made rashly and lightly, but as
   became them that had a serious sense of the interest of Christ and of
   his church in the world.

   3. As to the continuance of this separation, that if it were made upon
   good grounds, and the same grounds still continue, certainly we have no
   cause to revert and return back; the Roman synagogue not being grown
   better, but much worse, since the first breach.

   If all these can be proved, there is no reason to complain of our
   separation.

   First, That this separation was neither unjust nor unnecessary. It is
   unjust if it be made without a cause: it is unnecessary if it be made
   without a sufficient cause, or such a cause as may warrant so great a
   breach in the Christian world. Certain it is that the schism lieth not
   in the separation, but the cause; and so is not chargeable on those
   that make the separation, but on those that give the cause. So that if
   we would examine whether the separation be good, I think we must
   examine the causes of it; therefore let us a little consider this very
   thing. Certainly the cause was not unjust; there was a cause (I shall
   show that by and by); and that it was not unnecessary, without a
   sufficient cause, and so no way culpable.

   The business is, whether the controversies be of such moment as that
   there should be such a breach among Christians that we and they should
   keep such a distance (I speak only to the sufficiency of the cause, the
   justness we shall see by and by). Of what moment soever the
   controversies were, if the things that are taken to be errors be
   imposed as a condition of communion, a Christian cannot join himself
   with them. Certainly it is no sin to abstain from the communion of any
   church on earth, where the conditions of its communion are apparently
   unlawful and against conscience, though it may be the matters in debate
   be not of great moment. I only speak provisionally, be they or be they
   not of moment, yet if these be propounded as conditions of its
   communion; for no man is necessitated to sin. In some cases it is
   lawful to withdraw out of a place for fear of danger and infection; as
   if a house or town be infected with the pestilence, it is but a
   necessary caution to look to ourselves betimes, and withdraw out of
   that house or town.

   But now when no men are permitted to tarry but those that are infected
   with the disease, the case is out of dispute; the sound must be gone,
   and withdraw from them by all the means they can. Now, such are the
   corruptions of Popery, and the danger of seducement so manifest, that
   little children are by all means to keep themselves from idols,' 1 John
   v. 21. We should be very cautious and wary of that communion wherein
   there is so much hazard of salvation, if possible; we should keep
   ourselves untainted. But when we are bound to the belief, practice,
   profession of those errors, there needs no more debate; a Christian
   must be gone, else he will sin against conscience. Now this is the case
   clearly between them and us. Suppose the corruptions were not great,
   nor the errors damnable, yet when the profession of them is required,
   and the belief of them as certain truths is imposed, we are to endure
   all manner of extremity rather than yield to them. Therefore much more
   when it is easy to be proved that they are manifest and momentous
   corruptions. Therefore certainly to leave the communion of the popish
   faction is but to return to our union and communion with Christ; it can
   be no fault to leave them that left Christ, and the ancient faith and
   church. The innocent husband that leaves the adulterous wife is not to
   be blamed, for she had first broken the bonds, and violated the rights
   of the conjugal relation. Or, a good citizen and soldier are not to be
   blamed in forsaking their governor and captain, who first revolted from
   his allegiance to his prince, ay, and when he would engage them in the
   same rebellion too.

   Secondly, As to the management of it, or the manner how it was carried
   on. It was not made rashly and lightly, without trying all good means,
   and offering to have their complaints debated in a free council; in the
   meantime continuing in their station, and managing the cause of Christ
   with meek but yet zealous defences, until they were driven thence by
   antichristian fury for blowing the trumpet, and warning the church of
   her danger from that corrupt party; until persecuted by censures not
   only ecclesiastical but civil; cast out of the church, put to death,
   some for witnessing against, others merely for not owning and
   practising, these corruptions; and hunted out from their corners, where
   they were willing to hide, and worship God in secret, with all rigour
   and tyranny; driven first out of the church, then out of the world by
   fire and sword, unless they would communicate with them in their sin:
   thus were they used. So that the Romanists cannot charge the
   Protestants with schism for leaving their communion, any more than a
   man that thrusteth another out of doors can be offended at his
   departure. Yea, when the reformed did set up other churches, it was
   after all hopes of reformation were lost and defeated; and the princes,
   magistrates, pastors, and people were grown into a multitude, and did
   in great numbers run to the banner which God had displayed because of
   his truth, and so could not in conscience and spiritual safety live
   without the means of grace and the benefit of ordinances and
   church-societies, lest they should be scattered as sheep without a
   shepherd, and become a ready prey to Satan.

   And then this separation, which was so necessary, was carried on with
   love and pity, and with great distinction between the corruptions from
   which they separated, and the persons from whom they separated; and
   they had the same affection to them, and carried it all along just as
   those that are freed from Turkish slavery, and have broke prison, and
   invited the other Christian captives to second them. It may be they
   have not the heart and courage to venture with them; though they leave
   them fast in their enemies' chains, and will not return to their
   company, they cease not to love and pity them, though it were long, of
   their fear they did not enjoy the like liberty themselves.

   Thirdly, As to the continuance of this separation. It was made upon
   good grounds, and it is still to be continued upon the same grounds.
   The Roman Church is not grown better, but worse; and that which was
   before but mere practice and custom is since established by law and
   canon, and they have ratified and owned their errors in the Council of
   Trent. And now Antichrist is more discovered, and God hath multiplied
   and reformed the churches, and blessed them with his gifts and graces,
   and the conversion of many souls, surely we should not now grow weary
   of our profession, as if novelty only led us to make this opposition.
   If we shall think so slightly of all the truths of God and blood of the
   martyrs, and all this ado to bring things to this pass, that Christ may
   gain ground, and we should tamely give up our cause at last, as some
   have done implicitly, and others shrink, and let the Papists carry it
   quietly, it is such wickedness as will be the brand and eternal infamy
   of this generation. If Hagar the bond woman, that hath been cast out,
   should return again, and vaunt it over Sarah the lawful wife, the
   mischiefs that would follow are unspeakable. God permitted it to be so
   for a while in Queen Mary's days; and what precious blood was shed
   during that time we all know; and shall we again return to the garlic
   and onions of Egypt, as being weary of the distractions of the
   wilderness, and expose the interest of Christ, merely for our temporal
   good, which we cannot be secured of either? Therefore, since this
   separation was not unjust, without cause, nor unnecessary, without
   sufficient cause, and since it was carried on with so much meekness and
   Christian lenity, and since Borne is not grown better, but worse
   rather, surely we have no reason to be stumbled at for our departure
   from that apostatical church.

   In short, this separation was not culpable; it came not from error of
   mind: They went out from us, but they were not of us,' 1 John ii. 19.
   Not from corruption in manners: These are those that separate
   themselves, sensual, not having the Spirit,' Jude 19. Not from strife
   and contention, like those separations at Corinth, where one was of
   Paul, another of Apollos,' &c., 1 Cor. i. 12; not from pride and
   censoriousness, like those that said, Stand farther off; I am holier
   than thou,' Isa. lxv. 5. Not from coldness and tergiversation, as those
   that forsook the assembling of themselves together,' because they were
   in danger of this kind of Christianity, Heb. x. 25. But from
   conscience; and this not so much from the Christians, as from the
   errors of Christians; from the corruptions, rather than the corrupted.
   There is no reason we should be frightened with this suggestion.

   But now, because that separation is good or evil according to the
   causes of it, let us a little consider the state of Rome when God first
   summoned his people to come out of this spiritual Babylon; and if it be
   the same still, there is no cause to retract the change.

   The state of it may be considered either as to its government,
   doctrine, or worship; the tyranny of their discipline and government,
   the heresy of their doctrine, and the idolatry of their worship. And if
   our fathers could not, and if we cannot, have communion with them
   without partaking of their sin, it is certain the separation was and is
   still justifiable.

   First, As to their government. Three things are matter of just offence
   to the reformed churches:--

   1. The universality or vast extent and largeness of that dominion and
   empire which they arrogate.

   2. The supremacy and absolute authority which they challenge.

   3. The infallibility which they pretend unto.

   And if there were nothing else but a requiring a submission to these
   things, so false, so contrary to the tenor and interest of
   Christianity, this were ground enough of separation.

   1. The universality of headship over all other churches, this the
   people of God neither could nor ought to endure.

   Suppose the Roman Church were sound in faith, in manners, in
   discipline; yet, being but a particular church, that it should
   challenge such a right to itself, in giving laws to all other churches
   at its own pleasure, and that every particular society which doth not
   depend upon her beck in all things should be excluded from hope of
   salvation, or not counted a fellow-church in the communion of the
   Christian faith, this is a thing that cannot be endured.

   That the Pope, as to the extent of his government and administration,
   should be universal bishop, whose empire should reach far and near
   throughout the world, as far as the church of Christ reacheth; this, as
   to matter of fact is impossible; as to matter of right, is
   sacrilegious. As to matter of fact it is impossible, because of the
   variety of governments and different interests under covert of which
   the particular churches of Christ find shelter and protection in all
   the places of their dispersion; and therefore to establish such an
   empire, that shall be so pernicious to the churches of Christ which are
   harboured abroad, is very grievous; and partly by reason of the
   multitude and diversity of those things that belong to governments,
   which is a power too great for any created understanding to wield. As
   to matter of right, it is sacrilegious; for Christ never instituted any
   such universal vicar as necessary to the unity of his church. But here
   was one Lord Jesus, and one God, and one faith, but never in union
   under one pope. And therefore we see, in temporal government, God hath
   distributed it into many hands, because he would not subject the whole
   world unto one, as neither able to manage the affairs thereof, nor
   brook the majesty of so large an empire with that meekness and
   moderation as becomes a creature. It is too much for mere man to bear.
   Now religious concernments are more difficult than civil, by reason of
   the imperfection of light about them; and it would easily degenerate
   into superstition and idolatry; therefore certainly none but a God is
   able to be head of the church.

   2. The authority of making laws. Consider it either as to matter or
   form, the matter about which it is exercised, or the authority itself;
   their intolerable boldness and proud ambition is discovered in either.
   As to the matter about which this power is exercised, for temporal
   things, God hath committed them to the care of the magistrate; and it
   is an intrusion of his right for the Pope to take upon himself to
   interpose in civil things, to dispose of states and kingdoms; a power
   which Christ refused: Man, who made me a judge over you?' Luke xii. 14.
   As to matter of religion, some things are in their own nature good and
   some evil; some things of a middle nature and indifferent. As to the
   first, God hath established them by his laws; as to the other y they
   are left to arbitrament, to abstain and use for edification, according
   to the various postures and circumstances of times, places, and
   persons, but so that we should never take from any believer, or suffer
   to be taken from him, that liberty which Christ hath purchased for us
   by his blood. It is a licentious abuse of power not to be endured. We
   are to stand fast in that liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free,'
   Gal. v. 1. The apostle mainly intends it of the observance of the
   ceremonial law, which was a bondage, because of the trouble and
   expense. Oh! but then the price wherewith Christ bought our freedom
   should make us more chary of it, and stand in the defence of it with
   greater courage and constancy, whatever it cost us. The captain told
   Paul that his liberty as a Roman was obtained with a great sum,' Acts
   xxii. 28. Now, the court of Rome doth challenge such a power, that it
   commandeth and forbiddeth those things which God hath left free, as
   distinction of days, meats, marriage, according to their own pleasure,
   1 Tim. iv. 3; nay, sometimes dispenseth with that which God hath
   expressly commanded or forbidden; and then what doth it but make him
   equal with God, yea, superior to him? That physician possibly may be
   borne with that doth only burden his patient with some needless
   prescriptions, if for the main he be but faithful; but if he should
   mingle poison with his medicaments, and also still tire out his patient
   with new prescriptions, that are altogether troublesome, and costly,
   and nauseous, and for the number of them dangerous to life, it behoveth
   his patient to look to his health. And this is the very case. The Pope
   doth sometimes make bold with dispensing with God's laws, and doth
   extinguish and choke Christian religion by thousands of impositions of
   indifferent things, which is not to be endured.

   And then as to the authority itself; according to the eminency of the
   lawgiver, so is his authority more or less absolute. Therefore when a
   mortal man shall challenge an authority so absolute as to be above
   control, and to give no account of his actions, and it is not lawful to
   say to him, What doest thou? or inquire into the reason, or complain of
   the injury, this is that which the churches of Christ cannot endure.
   Therefore they had just ground and cause of withdrawing, and making up
   a body by themselves, rather than yield to so great encroachments upon
   Christian liberty; to receive the decrees of one church, and that so
   erroneous and imposing, without examination or leave of complaint.

   3. That which grieveth, and did grieve, and cause this withdrawing, is
   both papal infallibility and freedom from error. That any church which
   is made up of fallible men should arrogate this to themselves
   (especially the Roman, which of all churches that ever Christ had upon
   earth is most corrupt), that they should fasten this infallibility to
   the papal chair, which is the fountain of those corruptions, this they
   look upon as a great contradiction, not only to faith, but to sense;
   and as hard a condition as if I were bound, when I saw a man sick of
   the plague, and the swelling and tokens of death upon him, yet to say
   he is immortal, nay, that that part wherein the disease is seated is
   immortal. This was the burden that was imposed upon the people of God,
   that they should yield to this.

   Secondly, Come to their heresy in doctrine. To rake in this filth would
   take up more time than will comport with your patience. It is almost
   everywhere corrupt; the only sound part in the whole frame is the
   doctrine of the Trinity, which yet the schoolmen have entangled with
   many nice and unprofitable disputes, which render their glorious and
   blessed mystery less venerable. We must do them right also in this,
   that they grant the doctrine of Christ's satisfaction, and that he not
   only died for our good, but in our stead, and bore our punishment; they
   grant the truth of it, but deny the sufficiency of it: so mightily
   weaken, if not destroy it, while they think it must be pieced up by the
   sacrifice of the mass, human satisfaction, by the merit of works,
   purgatory, and indulgences. But in all other points of religion, how
   corrupt are they! That which most offends the reformed churches is
   their equalling traditions with the scripture; yea, their decrying and
   taxing the scriptures as obscure, insufficient, and as a nose of wax,
   pliable to several purposes; their mangling the doctrine of
   justification, which we own to consist in the imputation of Christ's
   righteousness received by faith; and they plead in the works of
   righteousness which we have done; and so, if the apostle may be judge,
   make void the grace of God,' Gal. ii. 21. And then the merit of works,
   not expecting the reward of them from God's mercy, which becometh
   Christian humility; but from the condignity of the work itself, which
   bewrayeth their pharisaical pride. We say that sins are remitted by God
   alone, exercising his mercy in Christ through the gospel, towards those
   that believe and repent. But the Papists say, pardon may be had by
   virtue of indulgences, if a man give such a price, do this or that, say
   so many ave marias and paternosters, though far enough from true faith
   and repentance. The one savours of the gospel, the other of the tyranny
   of the Pope of Rome, that hath set himself in the place of God, and
   substituted his laws instead of the law of Christ. So their portentous
   doctrine of transubstantiation, that a priest should make his maker,
   and a people eat their God. I could represent the difference of both
   churches, both in excess and defect. In excess, what they believe over
   and above the Christian faith. The true church believes, with the
   scriptures, and with the primitive churches, that there is but one God,
   Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, to be religiously invocated and
   worshipped. They plead the creature, angels and saints, are to be both
   religiously invocated and worshipped. The scripture shows that there is
   but one surety and mediator between God and man, he that was both God
   and man, Jesus Christ. They say that the saints are mediators of
   intercession with God, by whose merits and prayers we obtain the grace
   and audience of our supplications. The scripture saith that Christ's
   propitiatory sacrifice offered on the cross is sufficient for the
   plenary remission of all our sins. They say the sacrifice of the mass,
   which the priest under the species of bread and wine substantially,
   that is, by consecration into the body and blood of Christ, offered to
   God, that this is available for the remission of sins both of quick and
   dead. That the remission of sins obtained by Christ, and offered in the
   gospel to the penitent believer, is bestowed and applied by faith, this
   is the opinion of the scripture. They say remission of sins is obtained
   and applied by their own satisfactions and papal indulgences. That true
   repentance consists in confession of sin with grief, and desire of the
   grace of Christ, with a serious purpose of newness of life, this is the
   doctrine of the scripture. They think that to the essence of true
   repentance there is required auricular confession, penal satisfactions,
   and the absolvance of the priest, without which true faith profiteth
   nothing to salvation. Again, the scripture teacheth this doctrine, that
   the ordinances confer grace by virtue only of God's promises, and the
   sacraments are signs and seals of the covenant of grace to them that
   believe. And they would teach us that they deserve and confer grace
   from the work wrought. The scripture teacheth that good works are such
   as are done in obedience to God and conformity to his law, and are
   completed in love to God and our neighbour. They teach us that there
   are works of supererogation, which neither the law nor the gospel
   requireth of us; and that the chief of these are monastical vows,
   several orders and rules of monks and friars. The scripture teacheth us
   that God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, is only to be worshipped,
   both with natural and instituted worship, in spirit and in truth; and
   they teach both the making and worshipping of an image, and that the
   images of saints are to be worshipped. The scripture teacheth that
   there is but one holy apostolical catholic church, joined together in
   one faith and one Spirit, whose head, husband, and foundation is the
   Lord Jesus Christ, out of which church there is no salvation; and they
   teach us the Church of Rome is the centre, the right mother of all
   churches, under one head, the Pope, infallible and supreme judge of all
   truth; and out of communion of this church there is nothing but heresy,
   schism, and everlasting condemnation. Instead of that lively faith by
   which we are justified by Christ, they cry up a dead assent. Instead of
   sound knowledge, they cry up an implicit faith, believing as the church
   believes. Instead of affiance, they cry up wavering, conjectural
   uncertainty.

   Thirdly, Come to their worship. Their adoration of the host, their
   invocation of saints and angels, their giving to the Virgin Mary and
   other saints departed the titles of mediator, redeemer, and saviour, in
   their public liturgies and hymns; their bowing to and before images;
   their communion in one kind, and that decreed by their councils, with a
   non obstante Christi institute, notwithstanding Christ's express
   institution to the contrary; their service in an unknown tongue, and
   the like, are just causes of our separation from them. But it is
   tedious to rake in these things. So that unless we would be treacherous
   to Christ, and not only deny the faith, but forfeit sense and reason,
   and give up all to the lusts and wills of those that have corrupted the
   truth of Christianity, we ought to withdraw, and our separation is
   justifiable notwithstanding this plea.

   The use. Here is reproof to divers sorts.

   1. To those that think they may be of any sect among Christians, as if
   all the differences in the Christian world were about trifles and
   matters of small concernment, and so change their religion as they do
   their clothes, and are turned about with every puff of new doctrine. If
   it were to turn to heathenism, Turcism, or Judaism, they would rather
   suffer banishment or death than yield to such a change; but to be this
   day of this sect and to-morrow of another, they think it is no great
   matter. As the wind of interest bloweth, so are they carried, and do
   not think it a matter of such moment to venture anything upon that
   account. You do not know the deceitfulness of your hearts; he that can
   digest a lesser error will digest a greater. God trieth you in the
   present truth. He that is not faithful in a little will not be faithful
   in much, as he that giveth entertainment to a small temptation will
   also to a greater, if put upon it. Where there is not a sincere purpose
   to obey God in all things, God is not obeyed in anything. Every truth
   is precious. The dust of gold and pearls is esteemed. Every truth is to
   be owned in its season with full consent. To do anything against
   conscience is damnable. You are to choose the way of truth impartially,
   to search and find out the paths thereof.

   2. It reproves those that will be of no religion till all differences
   among the learned and godly are reconciled, and therefore willingly
   remain unsettled in religion, and live out of the communion of any
   church upon this pretence, that there is so much difference, such show
   of reason on each side, and such faults in all, that they doubt of all,
   and therefore will not trouble themselves to know which side hath the
   truth. You are to choose the way of truth. And this is such a fond
   conceit, as if a man desperately sick should resolve to take no physic
   till all doctors were of one opinion; or as if a traveller, when he
   seeth many ways before him, should lie down and refuse to go any
   farther. You may know the truth if you will search after it with humble
   minds: John vii. 17, If any man will do his will, he shall know of the
   doctrine whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.' The meek
   he will teach the way.' If you be diligent, you may come to a certainty
   notwithstanding this difference.

   3. It reproves those that take up what comes next to hand, are loath to
   be at the pains of study, and searching, and prayer, that they may
   resolve upon evidence; that commonly set themselves to advance that
   faction into which they are entered. Alas! you should mind religion
   seriously; though not lightly leave the religion you are bred in, yet
   not hold it upon unsound grounds. As antiquity: John iv. 20, Our
   fathers worshipped in this mountain.' Or custom of the times and places
   where you live: Eph. ii. 2, According to the course of the world,' the
   general and corrupt custom or example of those where we live; nor be
   led by affection to, or admiration of some persons, Gal. ii. 12. Holy
   men may lead you into error. Nor by multitude, to do as the most do:
   Follow not a multitude to do evil;' but get a true and sound conscience
   of things; for by all these things opinions are rather imposed upon us
   than chosen by us.

   4. It reproves those that abstain from fixing out of a fear of
   troubles; as the king of Navarre would so far put forth to sea as that
   he might soon get to shore again. You must make God a good allowance
   when you embark with him; though called not only to dispute, but to die
   for religion, you must willingly submit: If any man come to me, and
   hate not his own life, he cannot be my disciple,' Luke xiv. 26. How
   soon the fire may be kindled we cannot tell; times tend to Popery;
   though there be few left to stick by us--the favour of the times runs
   another way--we ought to resolve for God, whatever it costs us.

   5. It reproves those that think to reserve their hearts,
   notwithstanding outward compliance; the way of truth, being chosen, is
   to be owned, 2 Cor. vii. 1; the outward profession is required as well
   as the inward belief: Rom. x. 10, For with the heart man believeth unto
   righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.' A
   man that should lift himself among the enemies of his country, and
   fight with them, and say, I reserve my heart for my country, this is a
   mockage; as if a wife that prostitutes her body to another, should tell
   her husband she reserveth her heart for him. Satan would have outward
   prostration; he did not ask the heart, but, Fall down and worship me.'

   Use 2. To press us to choose the way of truth. Take it up upon
   evidence, and cleave to it with all the heart.

   First, Take it up upon evidence, the evidence of reason, scripture, and
   the Spirit. Reason will lead us to the scripture, the scripture will
   lead us to the Spirit; so we come to have a knowledge of the truth.

   1. Reason; that is preparative light, and will lead the soul thus far.
   It is a thousand to one but Christianity is the way of God; it will see
   much of God in this representation: and if you should go on carnally,
   carelessly, neglecting heaven and Christ, reason will tell you you run
   upon a thousand hazards, that there are far more against you than for
   you in your sinful courses. Stand upon the way. Where may you find such
   likelihood of satisfaction, or probability of salvation as in the
   religion we have? Either this is true or there is none: that you should
   venture your souls rather here than elsewhere; and at least, that you
   should profess the Christian religion as men go to a lottery; reason
   will tell you thus. A man that comes to a lottery, it is uncertain
   whether he shall have a prize or no; but it is but venturing a
   shilling, possibly he may have a prize; so reason will tell you, if it
   be uncertain whether there be a heaven or a hell, yet it is a thousand
   to one there are both: I may have a prize; and it is but venturing the
   quitting of a few lusts that are not worth the keeping. There are some
   truths above reason, but none contrary to it; for grace is not contrary
   to nature, but perfects it; therefore there is nothing in the gospel
   but what is agreeable to sound reason. Reason will tell us there is no
   doctrine agreeth so much with the wisdom, power, goodness, justice,
   truth, and the honour of God, as that doctrine revealed in the
   scripture.

   2. When reason hath thus brought you to the scripture, there is the
   great warrant of faith: John xvii. 20, They that believe in me through
   their word.' And Isa. viii. 20, To the law, and to the testimony, else
   there is no light in them.' That is the sacred standard by which we
   should measure all doctrines, and these will make wise the simple,' Ps.
   xix. The plainest, meanest, simplest man may find out the right way to
   heaven, if he will consult with God's book diligently, there he may
   become wise to salvation; the veriest fool and simple man may be taught
   how to walk directly and safely. This is the clue which brings us
   through all the labyrinths and perplexing debates in the world, to
   consult with the word of God, that we may not receive the truth upon
   man's credit, but see the grounds of it with our own eyes. He that
   finds the pearl of price must dig for it: Mat. xiii. 44, he must read
   the scriptures, be much in the study of God's book.

   3. The scripture leads us to the Spirit, because there are many
   mysteries in the gospel difficulty known, that will not be taken up by
   a sure faith without illumination from above. Besides, there are so
   many various artifices used by men to disguise the truth, Eph. iv. 14.
   And besides, there is a connate blindness and hatred of truth, which is
   natural to men, and therefore it is the Spirit of God must help us to
   make a wise choice. Look, as in practical things, we shall never choose
   the way of truth in opposition to the falsity of worldly enjoyments
   without the light of the Spirit; therefore it is said, Prov. xxiii. 4,
   Labour not to be rich, cease from thine own wisdom.' If a man be guided
   by his own understanding, he will choose riches: so also in matter of
   opinion, when we lean to our own understanding, we shall choose amiss.
   John xvi. 13, it is the Spirit of God that must guide us into all
   truth, therefore you must beg his direction; for if we that are so
   blind of heart be left to our own mistakes or the deceits of others,
   left to the direction of ourselves, how easily shall we err! Say, Lord,
   send out thy light and thy truth, to lead me to thy holy hill.'

   Secondly, As we should choose the way of truth, so cleave to it with
   all firmness and perseverance, without seeking out any other way, John
   vi. 67, 68. If you turn away from Christ, where will you get a better
   master? Change where you will, you will change for the worse; you will
   turn your back upon true comfort and true happiness, for he hath all
   this. So much for the first part, the Tightness of David's choice, I
   have chosen the way of truth.'

   In the latter clause, there you have his diligence and accuracy in
   walking according to the tenor of the true religion, Thy judgments have
   I laid before me.' By judgments is meant the precepts and directions of
   the word, as invested with threatenings and promises; for so the word
   contains every man's doom: not only the execution of God's providence,
   but the word, shows what will become of a man. Now these I have laid
   before me;' that is, propounded them as the rule of my life; as the
   king was to have the book of the law always before him, Deut. xvii. 19.

   Doct. When we have chosen the way of truth, or taken up the profession
   of true religion, the rules of it should be ever before us.

   Three reasons for this:--

   1. To have a holy rule and not a holy life is altogether inconsistent.
   A Christian should he a lively transcript of that religion he doth
   profess. A Christian should be Christ's epistle, 2 Cor. iii.; a walking
   Bible: Phil. ii. 15, 16, shining as lights, holding forth the word of
   life.' How? Not in doctrine, but in practice. A suitable practice
   joined with profession puts a majesty and splendour upon the truth. If
   there are many doubts about the true religion, why they are occasioned
   by the scandalous lives of professors; we reason from the artist to the
   art itself. Look, as there is a correspondence between the stamp and
   the impress, the seal and the thing sealed, so should there be between
   a Christian's life and a Christian's belief; the stamp should be upon
   his own heart, upon his life and actions; his action should discover
   his opinion, otherwise he loseth the glory and the benefit of his
   religion; he is but a pagan in God's account,' Jer. ix. 25; he makes
   his religion to be called in question; and therefore he that walks
   unsuitably, he is said to deny the faith,' 1 Tim. v. 8. To be a
   Christian in doctrine and a pagan in life is a temptation to atheism to
   others; when the one destroys the other, practice confutes their
   profession, and profession confutes their practice; therefore both
   these must be matched together. Thus the way of truth must be the rule,
   and a holy life must be suited.

   2. As to this holy life, a general good intention sufficeth not, but
   there must be accurate walking. Why? For God doth not judge of us by
   the lump, or by a general intention. It is not enough to plead at the
   day of judgment, you had a good scope and a good meaning; for every
   action must be brought to judgment, whether it be good or evil, Eccles.
   xii. 14. When we reckon with our servants, we do not expect an account
   by heap, but by parcels; so a general good meaning, giving our account
   by heap, will not suffice, but we must be strict in all our ways, and
   keep close to the rule in every action, in your eating, trading,
   worship: Eph. v. 15, See that you walk circumspectly,' &c. See that you
   do not turn aside from the line and narrow ridge that you are to walk
   upon.

   3. Accurate walking will never be, unless our rule be diligently
   regarded and set before us. Why?

   [1.] So accurate and exact is the rule in itself, that you may easily
   swerve from it; therefore it must always be heeded and kept in your
   eye, Ps. xix. David admired the perfections of the law for the purity
   of it, and for the dominion of it over conscience. What was the issue
   of that contemplation? See ver. 12, Who can understand his errors?
   cleanse thou me from secret faults.' Thus the best man, when he
   compares himself with the law, will be forced to blush, and acknowledge
   more faults than ever he took notice of before. When we see the law
   reacheth not only to the act but the aim, not only to the words but the
   thoughts and secret motions of the heart, then, Lord! who knows his
   errors? The law of God sometimes is said to be broad and sometimes
   narrow; a broad law: Ps. cxix. 96, Thy commandment is exceeding broad.'
   Why broad? Because it reacheth to every motion, every human action; the
   words, the thoughts, the desires, are under a law. Nay, yet more, the
   imperfect and indeliberate motions of the soul are under a law;
   therefore the commandment is exceeding broad. On the other side it is
   said to be narrow, A strait gate, and a narrow way.' Mat. vii. 14. Why?
   Because it gives no allowance to corrupt nature; we have but a strait
   line to go by. So that we need regard our rule.

   [2.] We are so ignorant in many particulars relating to faith and
   manners, that we need often consult with our rule. The children of
   light have too much darkness in them, therefore they are bidden to look
   to their rule: Eph. v. 17, Be ye not unwise, but understanding what the
   will of the Lord is.' Blind consciences will easily carry us wrong; and
   we have some new things still to learn from the word of God, for know
   ledge is but in part; therefore our rule should be ever before us.

   [3.] So many and subtle are those temptations which Satan sets on foot
   to make us transgress this rule. The devil assaults us two ways--by
   fiery darts,' and by cunning wiles,' Eph. vi. 11. He hath not only
   violent temptations, burning lusts, or raging despair, but he hath
   ensnaring temptations by his wiles, such as most take with a person
   tempted; and he transforms himself into an angel of light,' 2 Cor. xi.
   14; covers his foul designs with plausible pretences; therefore we need
   have our rule and the word of God ever before us.

   [4.] We are weak, and easily overborne, and therefore should bear our
   rule always in mind. God's people, their greatest sins have been out of
   incogitancy; they sin oftenest because they are heedless, and
   forgetful, and inattentive. Therefore, as a carpenter tries his work by
   his rule and square, so should a Christian measure his conversation by
   the rod of the sanctuary. God, whose act is his rule, cannot miscarry.
   So the schoolmen, when they set out God's holiness, say God's hand is
   his rule. But we, that are creatures, are apt to swerve aside,
   therefore need a rule. We should always have our rule before us. We are
   to walk according to rule, Gal. vi., and Josh. i. 7, 8, The book of the
   law shall not depart from thee,' &c. If we would have our rule before
   our eyes, we should not so often swerve. Christians, though you be
   right in opinion, that will not bring you to heaven, but you. must have
   the rules of this holy profession before you.

   Use. Oh, then, let the word of God be ever in sight as your comforter
   and counsellor! The more we do so the more shall we walk in the fear of
   God. You are not to walk according to the course of this world, but
   according to rule; and therefore you are not to walk rashly and in
   deliberately, and as you are led and carried on by force of present
   affections, but to walk circumspectly, considering what principle you
   are acted by, and what ends; and the nature and quality of our actions
   are always to be considered. Remember you are under the eye of the holy
   and jealous God, Josh. xxiv. 9, and eyed by wicked men who watch for
   your halting, Jer. xx., and eyed by weak Christians, who may suffer for
   your careless and slight walking, who look to the lives of men rather
   than their principles. You are the lights of the world,' Mat. v. 14,
   and light draws eyes after it; you are as a city upon a hill.' You that
   pretend to be in the right way, the way of truth, will you walk
   carelessly and inordinately? You are compassed about with snares; there
   is a snare in your refreshments, Ps. lxix.; your estates may become a
   snare, 1 Tim. vi. 9; your duties may be come a snare: be not a novice,
   lest you come into the condemnation of the devil,' 1 Tim. iii.
   Therefore take heed to your rule, be exact and watchful over your
   hearts and ways.

SERMON XXXIII.

   I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O Lord, put me not to shame.--Ver.
   31.

   IN the former verse David speaks of his choice, I have chosen the way
   of truth;' then of the accurateness of his prosecution, Thy judgments
   have I laid before me.' Now he comes to his constant perseverance
   therein, I have stuck unto thy testimonies.' These two verses follow
   one another in a very perfect order and coherence. We must begin with a
   right choice, there we must lay the foundation, I have chosen the way
   of truth,' and then persevere. There is a constancy in good and an
   obstinacy in evil. The devils sin from the beginning, as the good
   angels continued in their first estate. Men that are engaged in an evil
   course often continue in it without retractation; they are no
   changelings, always the same; that is no honour to them. Luther, when
   he was charged with apostasy for appearing against the Pope: Confitetur
   se apostatam esse, sed beatum et sanctum, qui fidem diabolo datam non
   servavit--he confesseth he was an apostate, but a holy and blessed one,
   that he did not keep touch with the devil. Constancy must ever be
   understood with respect to a right choice; for to break faith with
   Satan is not matter of dishonour, but of praise. We must go on with an
   accurate prosecution, for that giveth us experience, and causeth us to
   find joy and sweetness, and power in the truth, and is a great means of
   constancy.

   If men would be constant, the next thing they must do is to practise
   that religion they choose, and live under the power of it. Holiness is
   a great means of constancy: 1 Tim. iii. 9, Holding the mystery of faith
   in a pure conscience.' As precious liquors are best kept in clean
   vessels, so is the mystery of faith in a pure conscience. Men may be
   stubborn in their opinions out of natural courage, and the engagement
   of credit and interests; but this is of little worth without practical
   godliness: their orthodoxy and rightness in opinion will not bring them
   to heaven, nor shall they be saved because they are of such a sect or
   party. But then all must be closed up by persevering in our
   resolutions; otherwise all our former zeal will be lost. I have chosen
   the way of truth; thy judgments have I laid before me;' and then now, I
   have stuck unto thy testimonies: O Lord, put me not to shame:' 2 John
   8, Look to yourselves, that ye lose not those things which ye have
   wrought.' All that a man hath done and suffered, watching, striving,
   praying, they come to nothing unless we stick to it and persevere.
   Under the law a Nazarite was to begin his days of separation again, if
   he had defiled himself; if he had separated himself for a year, and
   kept his vow within two days of the year, he was to begin all anew,
   Num. vi. 12; and the interpretation of that type I cannot give you
   better than in the prophet's words: Ezek. xviii. 24, When the righteous
   turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, all his
   righteousness that he hath done shall not be remembered.' When they
   turn head against their former profession, it comes to nothing. Thus
   you see what a perfect dependence there is between this verse and the
   former.

   In the words there is--

   1. A profession, I have stuck unto thy testimonies.

   2. A prayer, O Lord, put me not to shame.

   First, For the profession, I have stuck to thy testimonies.' Saith
   Chrysostom, he doth not say, I have followed thy testimonies, but stuck
   or cleaved; stuck so fast that nothing could remove him, no
   difficulties, trials, shakings; he was still firm.

   Doct. Those that have chosen the way of God, and begun to conform their
   practice thereunto, ought with all constancy to persevere therein.

   First, We have the same reasons to continue that we had to begin at
   first. There is the same loveliness in God's ways; Christ is as sweet
   as ever; heaven is as good as ever. If there be any difference, there
   is more reason to continue than there was to begin. Why? Because we
   have more experience of the sweetness of Christ. You knew him
   heretofore only by report and hearsay; but now, when you have walked in
   the way of holiness, then you know him by experience; and if you have
   tasted, 1 Peter ii. 2, then certainly you should not fall off
   afterwards. Upon trial Christ is sweeter; and the longer you have kept
   to conscience, heaven is nearer; and would a man miscarry and be
   discouraged when he is ready to put into the haven? Rom. xiii. 11, Your
   salvation is nearer than when you first believed.' The nearer we are to
   the enjoyment of any good, the more impatient in the want of it; as
   natural motion we find swifter in the end, because it is nearer to the
   centre; but violent motion is swiftest at first; as when a stone is
   thrown upward, it is swifter at first, but when the impression of the
   external force is more spent, then the motion is weaker. It argues that
   you are not seriously thorough with God, if you should break with him
   after some profession of his name; now your motion should be more
   earnest, more strong towards him. I speak this, because we are so apt
   to cast off our first faith,' 1 Tim. v. 12; and to lose our first
   love,' Rev. ii. 4; and to grow remiss and lazy, and neglect our first
   works, 2 Chron. xvii. 3. Jehoshaphat is said to walk in the first ways
   of his father David.' We see many at the first are carried on with a
   great deal of affection and zeal; and there are many promising
   beginnings of a very flourishing spring; but yet they are no sure
   prognostications of a joyful harvest. Why, consider with yourselves, We
   have the same reasons to continue as to begin, yea, much more, as
   heaven is nearer. In a marriage relation true affection increaseth, but
   adulterous love is only hot while it is new. If our hearts be upright
   with God, we will increase with zeal for his glory and love to his
   testimonies.

   Secondly, The danger and mischievous effects of apostasy, and falling
   off, that is another reason why we should stick to his testimonies.

   1. It is more dishonourable to God than a simple refusal; for you bring
   an ill report upon him, as if he were not a good master. A wicked man
   that refuseth grace doth not so much dishonour God, be cause his
   refusal is supposed to be the fruit of his prejudice; but now you that
   cast him off after trial, your apostasy is supposed to be the fruit of
   your experience, as if the devil were a better master; when you have
   tried both, you return to him again. Tertullian, in his book De
   Poenitentia, hath this saying, After you have tried God, you do as it
   were deliberately judge Satan's service to be better, or at least you
   do not find that in God you did expect. Therefore the honour of God is
   mightily concerned, and lies at stake when you fall off after you have
   seemed to begin with him with a great deal of accurateness. And God
   pleads for himself, and stands for his credit, which seems to be
   wronged by this apostasy, Jer. ii. 5, casting off his service for the
   idols of the nation: What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that
   they are gone far from me?' and Micah vi. 3, O my people, what have I
   done unto thee, and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.'
   What! can you complain of God? Is God hard to be pleased, backward to
   reward? What cause of distaste have you found in him?--for implicitly
   you do as it were accuse him.

   2. When you fall off after a taste of the sweetness and practice of
   godliness, your condition is worse than if you had never begun. There
   are two dreadful scriptures which speak of the condition of total
   apostates after some taste, and after they have had some savour of holy
   things, and some delight in the ways of God. One is Heb. vi. 4-6, For
   it is impossible,' &c. Christians, after they have had some taste, and
   some enlightening, and made a savoury profession of godliness,
   afterwards they split themselves; some fall forward to errors and
   preposterous zeal; others fall backward by an unfaithful heart; one
   breaks his face, the other breaks his neck, as old Eli. But a little to
   clear that place. Certainly all of us should stand in fear of this
   heavy judgment of being given up to perish by our apostasy, to an
   obstinate heart, never to reconcile ourselves by repentance, even the
   children of God; for he proposeth it to them, supposeth they are made
   partakers of the heavenly calling. The apostle doth not speak there of
   every sin against knowledge, but of apostasy from the faith of Christ,
   and not of apostasy of general professors, that lightly come and
   lightly go, as the loose sort of Christians here among us; but
   specially of those that had a taste, savoury experience of the
   sweetness of God's ways. Again, he doth not speak of apostasy for a
   fit, in some great temptation of fear, but of deliberate apostasy of
   those that were enlightened, feeling, tasting, so as to make some
   strict profession; afterward turn off, lose all, turn atheists,
   antiscripturists, formalists, renouncing Christ and the world to come,
   in the hope of which they seemed before to be carried out with a great
   deal of delight, and strength and affection. The apostle saith, It is
   impossible they should be saved, because it is impossible they should
   repent. This is a fearful state; and yet, as fearful as it is, it is
   not unusual: it is a thing we see often in some that have made a
   savoury profession of the name of God, and afterwards have been
   blasted, either given up to an injudicious mind, or to vile affections,
   and are fallen off, and it is impossible to renew them again unto
   repentance. Oh, then, you that have begun, and have had a taste of the
   ways of God, and begun to walk closely with him, you should lay this to
   heart! Therefore this is propounded to believers, that they should keep
   at a very great distance from such a judgment, lest we grow to such an
   impenitent state as to be given up to a reprobate mind and vile
   affections.

   The other place is 2 Peter ii. 21, 22, It had been better, for them not
   to have known,' &c. Mark, there are some that through the knowledge of
   Christ may upon some general assent to gospel truths take up a strict
   profession of the name of Christ, may escape the pollution of the
   world, that is, outward and gross sins, being enrolled among God's
   children, and have the privileges of the members of his church, and yet
   after this may fall off dreadfully. It were far better for such never
   to have been acquainted with God and Christ than to return to their old
   bondage. A sin after knowledge and profession of the right way is
   greater than a sin of bare ignorance; therefore their condition is far
   more deplorable than the condition of other sinners, for no men sin
   with such malice as they do; they have had greater conviction than
   others, not only external representations of the doctrine of Christ,
   but some taste, and have made some closure with it in their own souls;
   they are more given over by God than others; and so there are none
   persecute and hate profession and strictness so much as they that are
   fallen from it; and they are more oppressed and entangled by Satan, as
   the jailor that hath recovered the prisoner which ran from him, loads
   him with irons. Therefore we had need betimes look to it, and continue
   and persevere in the practice of the ways of God, which we have owned
   and taken up upon experience.

   Use 1. Get grace, then look after perseverance. Evil men must get
   grace; and God's children their business is to persevere in that state
   to which they have attained.

   But what should we do to persevere?

   First, Be fortified against what may shake you from without; beware of
   being led away by offences and scandals. Three things are wont to give
   offence, and exceedingly shake the faith of some, viz., errors,
   persecutions, scandals.

   1. Errors. Be not troubled when differences fall out about the truths
   of God, nor shaken in mind; the winds of error are let loose upon the
   floor of the church to sever the chaff from the solid grain: 1 Cor. xi.
   19, There must be heresies among you, that they which are approved may
   be made manifest.' Take heed of taking offence at errors. I do not
   speak now of being led captive by error. Many question the ways of God,
   and give over all religion because there are so many differences and
   sects; therefore they think nothing certain. Certainly God saw this
   discipline to be fittest for his people; he hath told us there must be
   errors; he would not have us take up religion upon trust, without the
   pains of study and prayer. Lazy men would fain give laws to heaven, and
   teach God how to govern the affairs of the world; they would have all
   things clear and plain, that there should be no doubt about it. But the
   Lord in his wise providence saw it fit to permit these things, that
   they which are approved may be made manifest.' Men to excuse the
   trouble of search, study, and prayer, would have all agreed, else they
   take offence at religion, and think it to be but a fancy; that is one
   means to draw them off, even after some profession. What the canonists
   say grossly, this was their blasphemy, that God were not discreet and
   wise, unless he had appointed one universal test and one infallible
   interpreter; this is men's natural thoughts, they would have such a
   thing. The Jews say, Certainly Christ was not the true Messiah. Why?
   Because if he had, he would not come in such a way as to leave any of
   his countrymen in doubt. So many think religion is but a fancy; they
   fall off to atheism and scepticism at last, and irresolution in
   religion, because there are so many sects and divisions, and all
   upholding it with plausible pretences. To excuse laziness, we pretend
   want of certainty. But God's word is plain to one that will do his
   will, John vii. 17, if we will use all the means God hath appointed,
   and unfeignedly and with an unbiassed heart come to search out the mind
   of God.

   2. Persecutions, they are an offence: Mat. xi. 6, Blessed is he
   whosoever shall not be offended in me.' When the people of God are
   exposed to great troubles when they are in the world, they have but a
   mean outside. What! are these the favourites of heaven? It makes men
   take offence. Christians, what religion is it you are of? Is it not the
   Christian religion, whose great interest and work it is to draw you off
   from the concernments of the present world unto things to come? The
   whole drift and frame of the Christian religion is to draw men's hearts
   off from earthly things, and to comfort and support them under the
   troubles, inconveniences, and molestations of the flesh; therefore for
   a Christian to hope an exemption from them, is to make the doctrine of
   the gospel as incongruous and useless as to talk of bladders and the
   art of swimming to a man that never goes to sea, nor intends to go off
   from the firm land.

   3. A great occasion to shake the faith of many is scandals, the evil
   practices of those that profess the name of God. Oh! when they run into
   disorder, especially into all manner of unrighteousness, and iniquity,
   and cruel things, and make no conscience of the duties of their
   relations as subjects, as children, and the like, it is a mighty
   offence; and we that have to do with persons and sinners of all sorts
   find it a very hard matter to keep them from atheism, such
   stumbling-blocks having been laid in their way. Scandal is far more
   dangerous than persecution. There are many that have been gained by the
   patience, courage, and constancy of the martyrs, but never any were
   gained by the scandalous falls of professors. Persecutions do only work
   upon our fear, which may be allayed by proposal of the crown of life;
   but by scandalous action, how many settle into a resolved hardness of
   heart! In crosses and persecutions a man may have secret likings of
   truth, and a purpose to own it; but by scandal he dislikes the way of
   God, of religion itself; it begets a base and vile esteem thereof in
   the hearts of men, so they are loose and fall off. And this mischief
   doth not only prevail with the lighter sort of Christians, but many
   times those which have had some taste, it makes them fly off
   exceedingly: Mat. xviii. 7, There will be offences, but woe be unto
   them by whom they come.' Christ hath told us all will not walk up to
   the religion they own; therefore we must stand out against this
   temptation.

   Secondly, Be fortified within, by taking heed to the causes of
   apostasy, and falling off from the truth either in judgment or
   practice. What is there will make men apostates?

   1. Ungrounded assents. A choice lightly made is lightly altered. When
   we do not resolve upon evidence, and have not taken up the ways of God
   upon clear light, we shall turn and wind to and fro as the posture of
   our interest is changed. First we must try all things,' then hold
   fast,' 1 Thes. v. 21. Men waver hither and thither for want of solid
   rooting in truth. They take up things hand over head, and then like
   light chaff they are driven about with every wind of doctrine,' Eph.
   iv. 14. Half conviction leaveth us open to changes: James i. 8, A
   double-minded man is unstable in all his ways;' a man that seems to
   have a faith concerning such a thing, then seems to have a doubt
   concerning such a thing; sometimes led by his faith, at other times
   carried away by his doubts. If we have not a clear and full persuasion
   of the ways of God in our own minds, we shall never be constant.

   2. Want of solid rooting in grace, that is, rooted in faith,' Col. ii.
   7, or rooted and grounded in love,' Eph. iii. 17; as to both it is
   said, Heb. xiii. 9, It is a good thing that the heart be established
   with grace,' that is, by a sound sense of the love of God in Christ. A
   sweet superficial taste may be lost, but a sound sense of the love of
   God in Christ will engage us to him. Oh 1 we have felt so much
   sweetness, and have had such real proof of the goodness of Christ, that
   all the world cannot take us off. The more experience you have, and the
   deeper it is, the more you will be confirmed. The most of us content
   ourselves but in a superficial taste. When we hear of the doctrine of
   salvation by Christ, we are somewhat pleased and tickled with it; but
   this is not that which doth establish us, but a deep sense of God's
   grace, or feeling the blood of Christ pacifying our consciences; this
   is that which establisheth our hearts, and settleth us against
   apostasy.

   3. Unmortified lusts, which must have some error to countenance them.
   By an inordinate respect to worldly interests, we are sure to miscarry.
   A man governed by lusts will be at uncertainty, according as he is
   swayed by the fear or favour of men or his carnal hopes: 2 Tim. iv. 10,
   Demas hath forsaken us, having loved this present world.' If a man hath
   love to present things, if that be not subdued and purged out of his
   heart, he will never be stable, never upright with God. It may be he
   may stand when put upon some little self-denial for Christ; he may
   endure some petty loss, or some tender assault. Ay, but at length the
   man will be carried away as Joab, that turned after Adonijah, though he
   turned not after Absalom, 1 Kings ii. 28; there will some temptation
   come that will carry them away, though at first they seem to stand
   their ground, as long as lust remains unmortified in the heart.

   4. Sometimes a faulty easiness. As there is an ingenuous facility--The
   wisdom that is from above is gentle, and easy to be entreated,' James
   iii. 17 so there is a faulty easiness, when men cannot say nay; when
   they change their religion with their company, out of a desire to
   please all, and cameleon-like they change colour with every object.
   Some are of such a facile easy nature, soon persuaded into great in
   convenience. This faulty easiness always makes bold with God and
   conscience to please men, when we are of this temper: Jer. xxxviii. 5,
   The king is not he that can do anything against you.' It is not a good
   disposition, but baseness and pusillanimity. It is observed of
   Chrysostom, though a good man in the main, yet he ran into many
   inconveniences. Why? Because he was, through simplicity and plainness
   of his nature, easily to be wrought upon. Therefore though a good man
   (in regard of the sweetness of his temper and converse) should be as a
   loadstone, yet he should be also resolute and severe in the things of
   God. Paul, though they did even break his heart, they could not break
   his purpose.

   5. Self-confidence, when we think to bear it out with natural courage
   and resolution, as Peter did, Though all men forsake thee, yet will not
   I.' We are soon overborne, and a light temptation will do it. God gives
   men over that trust in themselves, for the Lord takes it to be his
   honour to be the saint's guardian, to keep the feet of his saints,' 1
   Sam. ii. 9. He will be owned and depended upon.

   6. There is an itch of novelty, when men are weary of old truths, and
   only rejoice in things for a season, John v. 35. There are many that
   look for all their virtue and their experience from their notions in
   religion. Thus they run from doctrine to doctrine, from way to way, so
   remain unmodified.

   Thirdly, Take heed of the first decays, and look often into the state
   of your hearts. A man that never casts up his estate is undone
   insensibly; therefore look often into the state of your hearts, whether
   you increase in your affections to God, in the power of holiness, or
   whether you go backward. It is the devil's policy, when once we are
   declining, to humble us further and further still, as a stone that runs
   down the hill; therefore take heed, look to the first declinings. A gap
   once made in the conscience, grows wider and wider every day; and the
   first declinings are the cause of all the rest. Evil is best stopped in
   the beginning. And, therefore, when you begin to be cold, careless in
   the profession of godliness, and not to have the like savour as you
   were wont to have, take heed. A heavy body, moving downward, still gets
   more strength, it goes down and moves faster still. Oh, therefore, stay
   at first! The first remitting of your watch and spiritual fervour is
   that which is the cause of all the mischief that comes upon many, so
   that they are given up to vile affections and lying errors. It is
   easier to crush the egg than kill the serpent. He that keeps his house
   in constant repair prevents the fall of it, therefore look to your
   hearts still. Our first declinings, though never so small, are very
   dangerous. Pliny speaks of the lioness, lib. viii. cap. 16; first she
   brings forth five lions, then four, then three, then two, then one, and
   for ever afterward is barren. Thus we first begin to remit of our
   diligence in holy things, and are not so frequent in acts of communion;
   then this and that goes off, till we have but little left us; and then
   all is gone, and men grow worse and worse. I may resemble it to
   Nebuchadnezzar's image, the head of gold, the breasts of silver, the
   thighs of brass, the feet of iron and clay, still worse and worse. So
   men are embasing by degrees, and fall off from God, and their savour of
   the ways of God.

   Fourthly, Often review your first grounds, and compare them with your
   after experiences, and what fresh tastes you had then of the love of
   God to your souls: Heb. iii. 14, We are made partakers of Christ, if we
   hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end.' The first
   rejoicing of faith, the sweet sense that you had, oh, how precious was
   Christ to you then, when first you came out of your fears! Revive this
   upon your heart; this will stir you up to be faithful to God. When the
   love of Christ was fresh upon your hearts, your motions were earnest.
   Many begin like a tree full of blossoms, give great hope of fruit. We
   should labour to keep up this affection, and that a cursed satiety may
   not creep upon us.

   Use 2. If those that have chosen the way of God and begin to conform
   their practice ought with all constancy to persevere, then it
   reproveth--

   1. Those that take up religion only by way of essay, to try how it will
   suit with them; they do not entirely, and by a resolute fixed purpose,
   give up themselves to the Lord. You should resolve upon all hazards;
   not take up religion for a walk, but for a journey. Not like going to
   sea for pleasure; if they see a storm coming, presently to shore again;
   but for a voyage to ride out all weathers. Thus you should do, stick to
   the ways of God, and at first make God a good allowance, that neither
   tribulation, nor distress, nor persecution, nor famine, nor nakedness,
   nor peril, nor sword, nor anything, may separate you from Christ.' Rom.
   viii. 35. We should count all charges, and resolve upon the worst.

   2. It reproves aguish Christians, whose purity and devotion come upon
   them by fits: Hosea vi. 4, Their righteousness is as the morning dew.'
   The morning dew, that cannot endure the rising sun, is soon wasted and
   spent when the sun ariseth with his heat and strength; whereas our
   righteousness should not be like the morning dew, but like the morning
   light.

   3. It reproves them that are only swayed by temporal advantages, that
   are oft and on; as the Samaritans, when the Jews were favoured by
   Alexander and other princes, then they would deny the temple that was
   upon Mount Gerizim, and say that they were brethren to the Jews; but
   when the Jews were in danger, then they would disclaim them. Thus many
   are swayed by temporal advantages, either intending or omitting the
   conscience of their duty, as they are favoured by men. But we are to
   stick to God's testimonies.

   Secondly, Let us come to David's prayer, O Lord, put me not to shame.'
   It is in the nature of a deprecation, or a prayer for the prevention of
   evil. The evil deprecated is shame. By shame some understand the
   reproaches of wicked men: Lord, let me not suffer their reproach, for I
   have stuck unto thy testimonies. A man that doth not stick to God's
   testimonies, that is not zealous and constant, will be put to shame
   before God and man, and made a scorn by them, and lie under great
   reproach; therefore, Lord, prevent this reproach. These reproaches are
   grievous, to be borne. It is against the spirit of man to be contemned,
   especially when he doth well. But certainly this cannot be meant; he
   would not so earnestly deprecate this, I should think, at least, not in
   such an expression, O Lord, put me not to shame.' He speaks of such a
   shame wherein God had a great hand. It is true, God may suffer this in
   his providence. Well, then, this shame may be supposed to result either
   from his sin or from his sufferings.

   First, From sin, I have stuck unto thy testimonies;' oh! suffer me not
   to fall into any such sinful course as may expose me to shame, and make
   me become a reproach to religion. Observe--

   Doct. The fruit of sin is shame.

   Shame is a trouble of mind about such evils as tend to our infamy and
   disgrace. Loss of life is matter of fear; loss of goods is matter of
   grief and sorrow; but loss of name and credit is matter of shame; and
   therefore it is a trouble of mind that doth arise about such evils as
   tend to our infamy and disgrace. Now this infamy and disgrace is the
   proper fruit of sin. To prove it by scripture, reason, and experience.
   To prove it by scripture: Shame entered into the world by sin; though
   they were naked, yet till they had sinned they were not ashamed,' Gen.
   ii. 25, with Gen. iii. 10; there was verecundia, an awful majesty, or a
   holy bashfulness in innocency; but not pudor, a fear of reproach and
   infamy; that came in by the fall. To prove it by reason: There are two
   things in sin, folly and filthiness, and both cause shame; it is an
   irrational act, and it hath a turpitude in it; therefore the fruit of
   sin is shame, and a fear of a just reproof. And then by experience: How
   do men hang the head and blush when they are taken in any unseemly
   action! All evil causeth shame. All sin, as soon as it is committed, it
   flasheth in the face of conscience. Shame is the striving of nature to
   hide the stain of our souls, by sending out the blood into the face for
   a covering; it labours most under this passion. And this shame
   accompanieth sin, not only when men are conscious of what we do, but it
   is a fear of a just reproof from God, nay, of a just reproof from
   themselves. There is a double loathness and fear in shame--when men
   sin, they are loath to look into their own heart, and loath to look God
   in the face: 1 John iii. 20, If our heart condemn us,' &c. When men
   have guilt upon their hearts, they are loath to take the candle of the
   Lord and look into the state of their souls. And they are loath to look
   God in the face; therefore the apostle adds, If our heart condemn us
   not, then have we confidence towards God,' that our prayers be not
   interrupted. As holy David had his shyness when he had been sinning
   away his peace; he kept silence,' Ps. xxxii. 3. He was fain to thrust
   forth his heart by a practical decree, and bring it by force into God's
   presence. Indeed some men are grown shameless, having a depraved
   judgment, and corrupted all their doings, Zeph. iii. 7; such have
   outgrown the common principles of natural honesty; and of all diseases,
   those which are insensible are the worst. Therefore when men are grown
   into a state of insensibility, and lose those feelings of conscience,
   it is very sad. Yet those which are most obdurate have their hidden
   fears, and are afraid of God and conscience, and are loath to be alone
   themselves, and are fain to knit pleasure to pleasure, to keep up this
   victory, and are forced to live in a jolly course, that they may bring
   a greater brawn upon their hearts.

   Use. Let this press us to avoid sin: Rom. vi. 21, For what fruit had ye
   of those things whereof ye are now ashamed?' If you sin, there will be
   shame. Sin in the greatest privacy brings shame. Though, you should be
   solitary and alone with yourselves, yet there is an eye sees and an ear
   hears all that you do. It was one of the rules of Pythagoras, Reverence
   thyself. If there were no other witness, there is a law of God in our
   own hearts that will upbraid us for sin.

   Again, David makes this request when he had professed perseverance, I
   have stuck unto thy testimonies,' yet, Lord, put me not to shame.' Note
   from thence--

   Doct. A man that hath long kept close to God in the way of his
   testimonies, yet he should pray to be kept from falling into shameful
   sin. Why?

   1. They which are most steadfast are not past all danger: 1 Cor. x. 12.
   Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.' He
   that hath the firmest footing may fall, and that foully too. When he
   begins to grow negligent and secure, he may be soon surprised, and
   drawn to dishonour the name of God; and as David, who was a man after
   God's own heart, sinned so foully that the name of God was blasphemed
   among the heathen. When once we come out of our fears, and are
   possessed of the love of God, we think there needs not be such
   diligence as when we were doubtful, and kept in an. uncertain
   condition, and so carry the matter as if we were past all danger. Oh,
   no! sin many times breaks out of a sudden; and after the first labours
   of soul in regeneration and terrors of the law are gone, there is great
   danger of security, and secretly and silently things may run to waste
   in the soul. God's children have been in most danger when to appearance
   there was least cause of fear. Lot, who was chaste in Sodom, fell into
   incest where there were none but he and his two daughters. He, whose
   righteous soul was vexed at their abominations, how was his conscience
   cast asleep by security! A child of God may fall into the grossest
   sins. David, whose heart smote him for cutting off the lap of Saul's
   garment, yet afterward fell into uncleanness and blood, and his
   conscience falls asleep. Therefore there needs watching and praying to
   the last.

   2. The miscarriages of God's children are most shameful. Oh, how will
   the Hams of the world laugh to see a Noah drunk! So a child of God,
   when he hath fallen into disorder, how will this furnish the triumphs
   of the uncircumcised! Blind Samson did not make such sport for the
   Philistines as a child of God for a wicked man, when he hath fallen
   into some notable excess: 2 Sam. xii. 14, By this deed thou hast given
   occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme.' Wicked men have a
   conscience, and they would be glad of any pretext to shake off the name
   of religion. When the children of God keep up the lustre of it, and
   live up to the majesty of their religion, the awe of it falls upon
   wicked men. But when they run into practices condemned by the light of
   nature and the laws of nations, it hardens wicked men, and takes off
   this awe and fear upon them. It is no matter what a rude Scythian or
   barbarous Goth doth, if they should exercise rapine and commit
   uncleanness; no matter what open enemies which are at defiance with
   God; though they break the laws of God over and over again, it is no
   such dishonour; but for a child of God, he that professeth the
   Christian name, to walk disorderly, it reflects dishonour upon God.

   3. Because of the hopes they have of speeding in prayer: 1 Tim. ii. 8,
   I will that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands without wrath
   and doubting.' Those that in a humble sense of their own weakness and
   fear of the mischief of being a blemish to religion, when they come to
   pray, they may be persuaded of God's goodness, of whom they have such
   long experience, that he will not fail them at length.

   Use. Let us pray that we may not dishonour the gospel in our trials,
   that God would not leave us to sin or shame, by total apostasy or by
   any scandals, that our crown may not be taken from us.

   Secondly, As this shame may be supposed to arise from his sin, so also
   from his sufferings, or from the disappointment of his hopes. Hope
   deferred leaves a man ashamed; therefore, Rom. v. 5, the apostle saith
   Hope maketh not ashamed.' When a man hath given out to others he hath
   such defences, hopes, expectations, and these fail, then he is ashamed.
   Thus David begs God would own him, that he might not be a scorn to
   wicked and ungodly men. Note--

   When they that stick to God's testimonies are disappointed of their
   present hopes, it is matter of shame.

   Observe it, and humble yourselves in your Father's anger, when he
   seemeth to go cross to our prayers and hopes, and gives to wicked men
   advantages against us: Num. xii. 14, If her father had but spit in her
   face, should she not be ashamed seven days?' When God doth not make
   good the confidence of his people, rather the contrary, the confidence
   of their enemies does as it were spit in their face; then it is time to
   take shame to themselves, and humble themselves before the Lord.

SERMON XXXIV.

   I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my
   heart.--Ver. 32.

   IN these words there are two parts:--

   1. A supposition of strength or help from God, when thou shalt enlarge
   my heart.

   2. A resolution of duty, I will run the way of thy commandments.

   Where--(1.) Observe, that he resolves, I will. (2.) The matter of the
   resolution, the way of thy commandments. (3.) The manner how he would
   carry on this purpose, intimated in the word run, with all diligence
   and earnestness of soul.

   The text will give us occasion to speak--

   1. Of the benefit of an enlarged heart.

   2. The necessary precedency of this work on God's part before there can
   be any serious bent or motion of heart towards God on our part.

   3. The subsequent resolution of the saints to engage their hearts to
   live to God.

   4. With what earnestness, alacrity, and vigour of spirit this work is
   to be carried on, I will run.'

   First, Let me speak of the enlarged heart, the blessing here asked of
   God. The point from hence is--

   Doct. Enlargement of heart is a blessing necessary for them that would
   keep God's laws.

   David is sensible of the want of it, and therefore goes to God for it.

   1. 1 shall speak of the nature of this benefit.

   2. The necessity of it.

   First, As to the nature, what this enlargement of heart is. There is a
   general and a particular enlargement of heart.

   1. The general enlargement is at regeneration or conversion to God.
   When we are freed from the bonds of natural slavery, and the curse of
   the law, and the power of sin, to serve God cheerfully, then is our
   heart said to be enlarged. This is spoken of in scripture: John viii.
   36, If the son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.' There are
   two things notable in that scripture--that this is freedom indeed, and
   that we have it by the Son. (1.) That this the truest liberty, then are
   we free indeed. How large and ample soever our condition and portion be
   in the world, we are but slaves without this freedom. As Austin said of
   Rome, that she was Domitrix gentium et captiva vitiorum--the mistress
   of the nations and a slave to vices; so vicious men are very slaves,
   how free and large soever their condition be in the world. Joseph was
   sold as a bondslave into Egypt; but his mistress, that was overcome by
   her own lust, was the true captive, and Joseph was free indeed. (2.)
   The other thing observable from this text is, that we have this liberty
   by Christ, he purchased it for us. This enlargement of heart from the
   captivity of sin cost dear. Look, as the Roman captain said, Acts xxii.
   28, With a great sum obtained I this freedom,' they were tender of the
   violation of this privilege of being a citizen of Rome, a free-born
   Roman, because it cost so dear. And when the liberties of a nation are
   bought with a great deal of treasure and blood, no wonder that they are
   so dear and precious to them, and that they are so willing to stand for
   their liberty. Certainly our liberty by Christ was dearly bought. One
   place more I shall mention: Rom. viii. 2, For the law of the spirit of
   life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.'
   The covenant of grace is there called the law of the spirit of life in
   Christ Jesus;' and the covenant of works is called the law of sin and
   death.' To open the place: The covenant of grace, that is accompanied
   with the law of the spirit; the covenant of works, that is the law of
   the letter--that only gives us the letter and the naked knowledge of
   our duty. Lex jubet, gratia juvat; it is the law of the spirit;' and
   not only so, but the law of the spirit of life which is in Christ
   Jesus,' because it works from the Spirit of Christ, and conforms us to
   the life of Christ as our original pattern. Well, then, this law of the
   spirit of life in Christ Jesus, it makes us free. This freedom, though
   purchased by Christ, is yet ap plied, executed, and accomplished by the
   Spirit. The Spirit makes us free, and from what? From the law of sin
   and death;' that is, from the law as a covenant of works, which is
   therefore called a law of sin and death, because it convinceth of sin,
   and bindeth over to death. It is the ministry of death to condemnation
   to the fallen creature.

   Let us see what this general enlargement and freedom is from these
   places. It consists in two things--a freedom from the power and from
   the guilt of sin, or the curse and obligation to eternal damnation.

   The first sort of freedom from the power of sin is spoken of Rom. vi.
   18, Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of
   righteousness.' There is a freedom from sin, and a freedom for sin, or
   a freedom from righteousness, as it is called, ver. 20, When you were
   the servants of sin,' saith the apostle, you were free from
   righteousness.' To be under the dominion of sin is the greatest
   slavery, and to be under the dominion of grace is the greatest liberty
   and enlargement. Then is a man free from righteousness, when he hath no
   impulsions or inclinations of heart to that which is good, when
   righteousness hath no command over him, when he will not be held under
   the restraints of grace, when he hath no fear to offend or care to
   please God. But on the other side, then is a man free from sin when he
   can thwart his lust, always warring against it, cutting off the
   provisions of the flesh; when he hath no purpose and care to act his
   lust, but it is always the bent and inclination of his heart to please
   God; and this is our liberty and enlargement.

   The other part of this liberty and enlargement is, when we are freed
   from the bondage of conscience, or fears of death and hell. Every
   covenant hath a suitable operation of the spirit attending upon it: the
   covenant of works hath an operation of the spirit of bondage; the
   covenant of grace hath an operation of the spirit of adoption. I say,
   the covenant of works, rightly thought of, produceth nothing in the
   fallen creature but bondage, or a dreadful sense of their misery; it is
   called the spirit of bondage, and every one which passeth out of that
   covenant hath a feeling of it: Rom. viii. 15, You have not received the
   spirit of bondage, again to fear.' You had it once, but not again. Then
   are we enlarged in this sense when the shackles are knocked off from
   our consciences, when we have that other spirit, the spirit of
   adoption, or that free spirit, as it is called: Ps. li. 12, Restore
   unto me the joy of thy salvation, and uphold me with thy free spirit.'
   This free spirit enlargeth us, that we may serve God cheerfully and
   comfortably.

   According to this double captivity (the slavery of sin and bondage of
   conscience) so must our freedom and enlargement be interpreted; a
   freedom from the power of sin, and a freedom from the guilt of sin. The
   carnal estate is often compared to a prison; as Rom. xi. 32, God hath
   concluded,' or shut them all up together in unbelief, that he might
   have mercy upon all;' Gal. iii. 22, The scripture hath concluded,' or
   shut up all under sin;' sunekleisen, that is the word. A man in his
   sinful and unbelieving state is like a man shut up in a strong prison,
   that is made sure and fast with iron bars and bolts, so that there is
   no hope of breaking prison; mercy alone must open the door to him: this
   being in prison notes the power of sin. But take the other notion,
   because of the guilt of sin. Now this prison is all on fire in the
   apprehension of the sensible sinner; and therefore the poor trembling
   captive, when the prison is all on a light flame, runs hither and
   thither, seeking an outgate and a way of escape, and mourns and sighs
   through the grates of the flaming prison. This is all our condition by
   nature. Now, when God loosens the bolts, and shoots back the many locks
   that were upon us, as the angel made Peter's chains fall off, Acts xii.
   12, then are we said to be enlarged, to run the way of his commandment,
   or, as it is expressed Luke i. 74, to be delivered out of the hands of
   our enemies, that we might serve him without fear in holiness and
   righteousness all the days of our life;' when we are delivered from the
   powers of corruption, which are as bolts and locks upon us, and the
   power of sin is broken, and we let out of the stocks of conscience,
   that we might serve God without slavish fear. This is the first thing
   we should mainly look at; the general enlargement must always go before
   the particular. First see that you be converted to God. It is that
   which hardeneth many. You shall find many are praying for strengthening
   grace when they should ask renewing grace; and when they should bewail
   the misery of an unregenerate carnal state, they confess only the
   infirmities of the saints, and so are like little children, that
   attempt to run before they can stand or go. Therefore here God must
   enlarge you, free you from the slavery of sin and bondage, that you may
   serve God.

   2. There is a particular enlargement, or the actual assistance of the
   Lord's grace, carrying us on in the duties of our heavenly calling with
   more success. This is that which David begs in this place, If thou wilt
   enlarge my heart.' There are, after grace is received, many spiritual
   distempers which are apt to seize upon us. Sometimes we are slow of
   heart, sometimes in bonds and straits of conscience as to God's
   service. A man of spiritual experience is sensible of these things, of
   a damp which is many times upon his life and comfort, and want of
   strength and largeness of heart for God's service. Whosoever makes
   conscience of daily communion with God, and that in every service would
   do his uttermost, cannot but be sensible of straits; and therefore it
   is grievous to him to be under bonds and restraints, and that he cannot
   so freely let out his heart to God. Others that do not make communion
   with God their interest, that go on in a dead track and course of duty,
   are never sensible of enlargement or straitening.

   But briefly, that we may know when the heart is enlarged, understand
   the nature of it, let us see when the heart in scripture is said to be
   enlarged.

   1. You may look upon this enlargement as the effect of wisdom and
   knowledge; and so Solomon is said to have a large heart: 1 Kings iv.
   29, And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and
   largeness of heart even as the sand that is on the sea shore.' The
   greater stock of sanctified wisdom and knowledge a man hath, the more
   is the heart enlarged; for he hath a treasure within him, and he is
   ready to bring out of the good treasure of his heart good things. He
   that hath more gold than brass farthings, when he puts his hand into
   his pocket, will more easily bring forth gold than farthings; so when
   the heart hath a good stock of holy principles within, they are ready
   at hand, they break out more easily in our discourse, in our praying;
   we are ready in all temptations to check the sin. All grace is
   increased to us by knowledge: 2 Peter i. 2, Grace be multiplied unto
   you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ our Lord.' Still
   this way doth God enlarge the heart of his people. When the
   understanding is full of pregnant truths, the greater awe there is and
   check upon the heart to sin, and the greater impulsion to duty. Look,
   as the influences of heaven pass through the air, but they produce
   their effects in the earth; they do not make the air fruitful, but the
   earth; so do the influences of grace pass through the understanding,
   but they produce their fruit in the will, and show forth their strength
   in the affections; and therefore when we would have our affections for
   God, the way is to enlarge the understanding.

   2. You may look upon it as the effect of faith, which wideneth the
   capacities of our souls, and doth cause us more to open towards God,
   that we may take in his grace; it doth enlarge our desires and
   expectations: Ps. lxxxi. 10, Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.'
   Surely a temple for the great God, such as our hearts should be, should
   be fair and ample. If we would have God dwell in our hearts, and shed
   abroad his influences, we should make room for God in our souls by a
   greater largeness of faith and expectation. The rich man thought of
   enlarging his barns when his store was increased upon him: Luke xii.;
   so should we stretch out the curtains of Christ's tent and habitation,
   have larger expectations of God, if we would receive more from him. The
   vessels failed before the oil failed. We are not straitened in God, but
   in ourselves, by the scantiness of our own thoughts; we do not make
   room for him, nor greaten God: Luke i. 46, My soul doth magnify the
   Lord.' Faith doth greaten God. Why, can we make God greater than he is?
   As to his declarative being, we can have greater and larger
   apprehensions of his greatness, goodness, and truth*

   3. We may look upon it as an effect of comfort and joy, through the
   assurance of God's love; for that enlargeth the heart, but sorrow
   straitens it, and puts it in bonds. The word that we translate grief,
   Judges x. 16, His soul was grieved for the misery of Israel;' in the
   Hebrew it is shortened or lessened.' A man's mind is lessened when he
   is under that passion. Griefs contract and lessen the soul, but joy
   enlargeth it, as Isa. lx. 5; and in this sense it is said, Ps. iv. 1,
   Thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress.' In sorrow the spirits
   return to comfort and support the heart, but in joy they are dilated
   and scattered abroad; and so this is that affection which sends abroad
   strength and life into all our actions. As this is true of joy and
   sorrow in common, so especially of spiritual joy and spiritual sorrow,
   which are the greatest of the kind; no sorrow like that sorrow, no joy
   like that joy; therefore nothing more enlargeth the heart. When God
   hides his face, when pressing troubles do revive a sense of wrath,
   alas!' My soul is troubled,' saith the Psalmist, I cannot speak;' we
   cannot pour out our hearts to God with that largeness, that measure of
   strength, spirit, and life as before. But now, when we can joy in God
   as those that have received the atonement, when we have the comfort of
   a good conscience, the joy in the Holy Ghost, this causeth a forward
   and free obedience; and those that could hardly creep before, but
   languished under the burden of sorrows, when cheered and revived with
   the light of God's countenance, they can run and act with vigour and
   alacrity in God's service: Neh. viii. 10, The joy of the Lord is their
   strength.' It is as oil to the wheels, as wings by which we mount to
   meet with God: Ps. xxx. 11, Thou hast turned for me my mourning into
   dancing; thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness.'
   It is an allusion to those eastern countries; when their garments were
   girded and tucked up, they were more expedite and ready to run. So
   here, when thou shalt enlarge my heart, then I will run the way of thy
   commandments. When our soul is filled with gladness, and comfortable
   apprehensions of the Lord's grace, we are carried out to God with
   greater strength and liveliness.

   4. We may look upon it as a fruit of love. For thus the apostle doth
   express his love to the Corinthians, 2 Cor. vi. 11, O ye Corinthians,
   our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.' It is love which is
   the great poise and weight upon the soul that sets all the wheels
   a-going. When love is strong, the heart is carried out with fervour and
   earnestness: Neh. iv. 6, We built the wall.' Why? For the people had a
   mind to the work;' then it went on speedily. Where we have no affection
   to a thing, the least service is burdensome; but when our hearts are
   for it, then the most difficult thing will seem easy; Jacob's seven
   years' hard service were sweetened by his love to Rachel; yea, duties
   against the hair, as Shechem for Dinah's sake submitted to be
   circumcised. Love sets us a-work strongly.

   Thus the general enlargement is when we are freed from the slavery of
   sin and bondage of conscience, that we may serve God cheerfully; and
   the particular enlargement, you may look upon it as a fruit of wisdom
   and knowledge, or of faith, or of joy, or of love; when we have a
   fruitful understanding, a large faith, a sweet delight in God, and a
   strong love to him.

   Secondly, For the necessity of this, that the heart should be enlarged
   before we can run the way of God's commandments.

   1. There needs a large heart because the command is exceeding broad:
   Ps. cxix. 96, I have seen an end of all perfection; but thy commandment
   is exceeding broad.' A broad law and a narrow heart will never suit. We
   need love, faith, knowledge, and all to carry us through this work,
   which is of such a vast extent and latitude.

   2. We need an enlarged heart because of the lets and hindrances within
   ourselves. There is lust drawing off from God to sensual objects: James
   i. 14, Every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and
   enticed.' Therefore there needs something to poise us, to incline us,
   to draw us on, to carry us out with strength and life another way, to
   urge us in the service of God. Lust sits as a clog upon us; it is a
   weight of corruption, Heb. xii. 1, retarding us in all our flights and
   motions, thwarting, opposing, breaking the force of spiritual
   impulsions, if not hindering them altogether, Gal. v. 17. Well, then,
   lust drawing so strongly one way, God needs to draw us more strongly
   the other way. When there is a weight to poise us to worldly and
   sensual objects, we need a strength to carry us on with vigorous and
   lively motions of soul towards God, an earnest bent upon our souls,
   which is this enlargement of heart.

   Use 1. Let us therefore look after this benefit, and acknowledge God in
   it.

   First, Ask it often of God. God keeps assisting grace in his own hands,
   and disposeth it at pleasure, that he may the oftener hear from us. The
   prodigal, that had his portion in his own hands, went away from his
   father; and therefore we have but from hand to mouth, that we may be
   daily kept in a dependence and constant course of communion with God.
   It is pleasing to God, when we desire him to renew his work, to bring
   forth the actings of grace out of his own seed, to blow with his wind,
   with the breath of his Spirit upon our gardens, that the spices may
   flow out, Cant. iv. 15. But now, when we depend upon ourselves, and
   neglect God, and think to find always a like largeness of heart and a
   like savouriness of spirit, we shall be but like Samson: Judges xvi.
   20, When his locks were gone, he thought to go forth and shake himself
   as at other times, and wist not that the Lord was departed from him.'
   So when our strength is gone and God withdrawn, we shall not find a
   like pregnancy and consistency of thoughts, a like readiness and vigour
   of affections in holy duties, but all will be out of order; the
   understanding is lean, dry, and sapless, the heart averse and dead; and
   therefore God will be acknowledged in our enlargements, both as to
   prayer and praise. In a way of prayer we should often seek to him; and
   he will be acknowledged in a way of praise likewise: Ps. lxiii. 8, My
   soul followeth hard after thee; thy right hand upholdeth me.' If you
   find any strong actings of faith and love stirred up to follow hard
   after God, to pursue him close in holy duties, when you feel any of
   these vigorous and lively motions, ascribe it not to yourselves, but to
   God's right hand; he is to be owned in the work.' Not I,' saith the
   apostle, but the grace of God wrought in me.'

   Secondly, Avoid the causes of straitening, if you would have this
   enlarged heart. What are they?

   1. Ignorance and defect of gifts; for it is by knowledge all grace
   comes into the soul: Col. iii. 16, Let the word of God dwell in you
   richly.' When the understanding is fraught with spiritual treasure,
   when the word of God dwells in us richly, then we have it upon all
   occasions to help us, we have at home a truth ready, and can call it to
   mind, either for suppressing of temptation, or encouraging us to duty,
   or for allaying of such a grief, speaking comfort under such a cross;
   otherwise we are lean, dry, and cannot act with that fulness of
   strength. But--

   2. Another thing that straitens the heart is the love of present
   things. So much as your hearts are enlarged to the flesh, so much they
   are straitened to the spirit, 2 Cor. vi. 13; as what the land loseth
   the sea gains. By pleasures and by the cares of the world your hearts
   are straitened towards God, they are overcharged,' Luke xxi. 34.

   3. Sorrow and uncomfortable dejection of spirit, through the fears of
   God's wrath, or by reason of desertion, when we have a sense of his
   wrath, and when we can find no effects of his grace. God with draws,
   you have not your wonted influences, your wonted answers of prayer: Ps.
   lxxvii. 4, I am so troubled that I cannot speak.' This locks up the
   heart, and hinders it in the service of God, that it cannot so freely
   come and pour out its soul.

   4. Great sins work a shyness of God. The faulty child blusheth, and is
   loath to look his father in the face, when he hath been doing some
   offence. The Israelites, after they had sinned in the matter of the
   calf, they stood afar off, and worshipped every man in his tent-door.
   You lose your freedom by gross sins: 1 John iii. 21, If our hearts
   condemn us not, then parresian echomen, we have confidence towards
   God;' we may come into God's presence without a self-accusing and
   condemning conscience. You have not this liberty and enlargedness of
   heart towards God when an accusing conscience pursues you. When a man
   hath lost his peace and comfort, he cannot come and tell God all his
   mind, his temptations, straits, doubts, fears.

   5. Unbelief. That is a cause of straitening, when it represents God
   under an ill notion; as terrible: Lam. iii. 10, He was unto me as a
   bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret places;' Isa. xxxviii. 13,
   I reckoned till morning, that as a lion so will he break all my bones:
   from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.' It fills us with
   misconceits of God, as if he were terrible. When one came tremblingly
   with a petition to Augustus, What! said he, art thou giving a sop, a
   bit to an elephant? We disguise the majesty of God by our unbelieving
   thoughts; we come to him as to a bear and lion that is ready to tear us
   in pieces, and then we cannot have that cheer fulness and delight in
   his service.

   6. Pride. We are not humbled, but puffed up, when our heart is
   enlarged, and abuse the quickening influences of the Lord's grace to
   feed our pride: Ps. li. 15, Open my lips, and my mouth shall show forth
   thy praise.' He doth not say, Mine own praise; then I will discover my
   gifts, and show what I can do: but, Thy praise. Many beg quickening and
   enlargement to set off themselves, and ask contributions of heaven to
   supply the devil's service; or as he that lighted his lamp at the altar
   that he might go and steal with-it. We would put up self as an idol in
   God's stead, and have help from God that we might make him serve with
   our iniquities, that we might set off ourselves with honour and esteem
   in the world. Therefore God with draws and withholds his hand. These
   are the causes of straitening.

   Use 2. Let us then see if we have this benefit, an enlarged heart,
   which is so necessary for the keeping God's commandments.

   Two things will deceive us: many think they have it when they have it
   not, and many think they have it not when indeed they have it.

   1. Many think they have it when they have it not. Enlargement of gifts
   differs from enlargement of grace. A ready tongue many have--that
   depends upon the temper of the body--but not a humble heart. They may
   take pride and complacency in their own gifts, and yet not delight in
   communion with God. There are many in the world that have abilities of
   utterance, and some fanatical joys accompanying the exercise of it, and
   yet they have not an unfeigned love to God. Such as are enlarged in
   point of gifts, it is many times seen in this, that generally in
   private they are more careless, and they are more in expression than in
   feeling. The great deceit and counterfeit of grace is parts and common
   gifts, especially when exercised in holy things, in a spiritual way,
   and for the good and edification of others. Certainly men have not
   spiritual enlargement when they still lie under the bondage and
   dominion of sin; and so though they may seem to have particular
   enlargement in some duties, and may be carried on with a great flush of
   gifts, yet they have not a general enlargement, the yoke is not broken,
   but still they are the servants of corruption.

   2. On the other side, some think they have it not when indeed they have
   it. Why? Because they are not carried out in the work of God, as
   sometimes they seem to have been, with that liveliness and comfort. Let
   me tell you, there are necessary aids of grace, and there are more
   liberal aids of grace, over and above the necessary. If you have the
   necessary aids of grace, you are to acknowledge God hath enlarged your
   hearts, though you have not the larger measure, strength, and activity
   in God's service, which, upon the days of his magnificence and
   spiritual bounty, he is wont to dispense to his people. God doth not
   always continue these dispensations. Sometimes we find that Christians
   outgo themselves, and are enlarged beyond the ordinary pitch. Let me
   represent it by a similitude. We are not to esteem a river by its
   swelling and running over the banks after a mighty, long, and continued
   rain, but by its constant course; nor are we to judge of a town by the
   great concourse at a fair or market, the town is not every day so
   filled. So neither are we to judge of God's assistance by those high
   tides of comfort or strength of gracious impulses which, in the days of
   spiritual bounty, he is wont to give. If you are enabled to walk humbly
   with God, though you have not such heights of affection, you should be
   thankful.

   So much for the first thing the text offers, the blessing asked, viz.,
   an enlarged heart.

SERMON XXXV.

   I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my
   heart.--Ver. 32.

   THE second thing that is offered here is the necessary precedency of
   this work on God's part before there can be any serious bent and motion
   of heart towards God on our part. When thou shalt enlarge my heart.'
   When is causal, because thou shalt enlarge it. God only can enlarge the
   heart. We are sluggish, and loath to stir a foot in the ways of
   obedience, therefore God must enlarge. From first to last God doth all
   in the work of grace; he gives the habit and act. He plants graces in
   the heart, knowledge, faith, love, and delight; and then excites and
   quickens them to act. The habit of grace is called the seed of God,' 1
   John iii. 9; there it begins. Before we can fly we must get wings, we
   must have grace before we can run the way of God's commandments; and
   then quickening of the habits, the exciting of the soul to action; the
   deed as well as the will, Phil. ii. 13; it is from God, the first
   inclination and actual accomplishment; he giveth to will, that is, the
   first inclination: 1 Kings viii. 58, That he may incline our hearts
   unto him, to walk in all his ways,' &c. And then the deed, the outward
   expression of our obedience, it is still from God: Acts iv. 29, the
   apostle goes to God for that, Grant unto thy servants that, with all
   boldness, they may speak thy word;' and so Col. iv. 3Jie begs, prays to
   God to open a door of utterance for them. There is a door shut until
   God opens it. We cannot utter and express ourselves in a. way of
   obedience without God's concurrence.

   Use. Whenever you would undertake for God, get God first to undertake
   for you, as Hezekiah doth: Isa. xxxviii. 14, O Lord, I am oppressed;
   undertake for me.' Let every earnest prayer be accompanied with a
   serious purpose, and let every serious purpose be accompanied with
   earnest prayer: Cant. i. 4, Draw me and we will run after thee.' So
   here, Lord, I will run the ways of thy commandments.' Ay, but as to the
   event, we must suspend it: If thou wilt enlarge my heart.' This is the
   method we should use: first engage God by prayer, then engage our
   hearts by promise. Though we cannot lay wagers upon our own strength,
   yet we may resolve in God's strength, and ought to engage ourselves to
   duty: Jer. xxx. 21, Who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto
   me, saith the Lord?' We must promise what is due, but not presume as if
   we could carry our purpose without God. As to the event, they speak
   conditionally, When thou shalt enlarge my heart.' The children of God
   have no other confidence of their own affections but as God will put
   forth his power. They know they have a deceitful and corrupt heart; and
   to stand to their resolutions immutably, faithfully, needs more
   strength than their own. They resolve as to work, but as to event, they
   suspend that; they know their resolution will not be brought to
   anything unless God continue his grace and favour. The children of God,
   as they would own Christ as Lord, and commanding the work, so they
   promise obedience; that is their duty; and as they would own him a
   Saviour in helping them through the work, so they promise conditionally
   in his strength. As they are swayed by his sovereignty in his command,
   so they depend upon his all-sufficiency in his promise.

   Here two cases may be handled; one is more generally--

   Case 1. Whether we are to resolve upon a course of obedience when we
   are uncertain of God's assistance? The reason of doubting is, be cause
   we cannot perform it in our own strength. I answer--

   1. It is your duty to engage and consent to give up yourselves to God's
   service whatever comes of it: 2 Chron. xxx. 8, Yield yourselves unto
   the Lord.' In the Hebrew it is strike hands with him in his holy
   covenant: Rom. xii. 1, I beseech you, present yourselves,' &c. You
   ought to come and present yourselves, own yourselves solemnly in a way
   of dedication to God. It was implied in our baptism, which is therefore
   called, 1 Peter iii. 21, An answer of a good conscience to wards God;'
   an answer upon God's demands in his covenant. An answer supposeth a
   question. God puts us to the question, Will you be my people? will you
   serve me faithfully and do my will? Then we ratify it by baptism.
   Necessary duties must be done whatever comes of it, as Abraham obeyed
   God, not knowing whither he went.'

   2. As this is your duty, so, whether you resolve or no, you are already
   obliged by God's command. This actual resolution of entering into
   covenant with God is only required as a means to strengthen us. Natural
   relations enforce duty without consent; a father is a father whether a
   child will own him in the quality of that relation, yea or nay. God's
   right is valid whether you will consent or not. Actual consent or
   purpose in your heart doth not give God greater right, but makes duty
   more implicit and active upon your own hearts. We cannot make the bonds
   of duty stronger, for God's authority is greater than ours, but we have
   a deeper sense when we own God's authority by our own engagement.

   3. You have more cause to expect God's assistance in this way of
   engaging your heart to him than in standing loose from God, and neglect
   of his appointed means. You know the promise is made, Rev. xxii. 17, To
   him that will, let him take of the waters of life freely.' When there
   is a fixed bent of heart that comes from a secret impression of God's
   grace which causeth this will in you, when you have declared your will,
   you have more reason to expect God's concurrence.

   4. It is a foolish course to refuse to make the covenant for fear of
   breaking it; as if a tradesman should neglect his calling, forbear to
   set up, because it is possible losses may come. Make it, then keep it
   in God's strength. Make it, but remember, your security lieth in God's
   promises, not in your own. It is your duty to engage to God; but as to
   the event, you cannot say you can go through with it, unless the Lord
   put in with his grace.

   Case 2. The second case is more obvious and usual, viz., whether we are
   to do duties in case of deadness, indisposition, and straits of spirit?
   The reason of doubting is, because David seems to suspend his running
   upon God's enlarging--If thou wilt enlarge, then I will run. Ans. He
   suspends the event, but not his duty. He doth not say I will not stir
   unless thou enlarge my heart, but, If thou enlarge then I shall run.
   The plea of weakness must not be used, from the doctrine of God's
   concurrence to all acts of grace, as a shift, or turned into a plea for
   laziness. The right use of this doctrine is a constant dependence in a
   sense of our own weakness, and hearty thanksgiving when we have
   received any command from God. Now a form of thanksgiving is abused
   when it is made a plea for laziness. To resolve upon a loose course,
   and give over all, is an absurd inference from this doctrine; it is as
   if a man should say, my ploughing and sowing, unless God give the
   increase, will never make the corn grow, therefore I will hold my hand,
   and take the other sleep. It is God sends the wind, therefore I will
   not put forth the sails; that is no good inference. For further
   arguments, see ver. 25, where the question is handled, whether we are
   to do duties in case of deadness. It is a most commendable thing to
   work notwithstanding indispositions. There is more faith in it; God's
   love is glorified when you can cast yourselves into his arms, then when
   he seems to shut up himself from your prayers, and to suspend the
   influences of his grace, Esther had great confidence to venture when no
   golden sceptre was held forth; so when we have no sensible comfort,
   then to venture and cast ourselves upon God. And it argues more faith
   in the power of God. As Abraham's faith was commended, that he could
   believe against hope; so, when all is dead, yet you will see what God
   will do for the quickening and enlarging of the soul. Then there is
   more obedience in it. No duty so commendable as that which is recovered
   out of the hands of difficulty, when in the face of temptation we can
   venture to go to God. And there is humility in it, when we can look
   upon ourselves as bound though God be free. I must wait upon him in the
   use of means, though I have a dead heart.

   Thirdly, The subsequent operation of the saints; they that are acted by
   God act under him: Then will I run the way of thy commandments.'

   First, Mark, he resolveth, Then I will run.' He doth not say, Then I
   should run, but will run, as binding his soul by a resolution, and his
   resolution by a solemn promise, Then I will run the way of thy
   commandments.' Here I might take occasion to speak of the good of
   binding the heart, and being resolved in a course of godliness. It is
   good to engage us to come to God, to keep to God, and to be hearty in
   his service.

   1. This is that which engageth us to come to God, because of ourselves
   we are off and on, hanging between heaven and hell, and have many loose
   and wavering thoughts, until we come to a firm purpose and
   determination, and that engageth the heart: Jer. xxx. 21, Who is this
   that engageth his heart to approach unto me, saith the Lord?' Before we
   come to this engagement, there are several things:--(1.) A simple and
   bare conceit of the ways of God, or of the goodness of holiness, this
   will not bring us to God, some general approbation of his ways. Many
   will say, God is good to Israel,' Ps. lxxiii. 1; but the heart never
   comes off kindly to choose God till the judgment determines, It is good
   for me to draw nigh to God,' ver. 28. This puts an end to many anxious
   traverses, debates, and delays in the soul. (2.) There are weak and
   wavering purposes, and faint attempts in the soul, that end but in
   wishes, which are soon broken off; but we are never converted and
   thoroughly brought to God till there be a full and fixed purpose: Acts
   xi. 23, He exhorted them all, that with full purpose of heart they
   would cleave unto the Lord.' When it comes to a plenary thorough
   purpose of heart, then grace hath wrought upon us.

   2. As it will bring us to come to God, so it causeth us to keep to God.
   He that is unresolved is never constant: James i. 8, A double-minded
   man is unstable in all his ways.' There is in us a changeable heart, a
   rebelling nature; that meeting with temptations from without, unless
   there be a fixed purpose, alas! we shall be unstable in all our ways;
   all good wishes and faint purposes come to nothing, but we shall give
   out at every assault. But when we are firmly and habitually resolved,
   Satan is discouraged. This bindeth our holy purposes, like hemming of
   the garment, that keepeth it from ravelling out. Whilst we are thinking
   and deliberating what to do, we lie open to temptations, the devil hath
   some hope of us; but when the bent of our hearts is set another way,
   and the devil sees we are firmly resolved, and have holy purposes, he
   is discouraged. This was that which made Daniel so courageous and
   resolute in God's service: Dan. i. 8, He purposed in his heart that he
   would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat.'

   3. By resolution we are quickened to more diligence and seriousness.
   Good purposes are the root of good works, and without the root there is
   no fruit to be expected. A true and inward purpose will not let us be
   idle, but still urging and soliciting us to that which is good, then we
   make a business of religion; whereas otherwise we make but a sport and
   recreation, that is, mind it only by the by. But now, One thing have I
   desired, and that will I seek after,' Ps. xxvii. 4. When the heart is
   set upon a thing we follow it close, whatever we neglect. Whereas
   otherwise we are very lazy, careless, and do it as if we did it not;
   this makes us diligent, earnest, careful to maintain communion between
   God and us.

   Use. Well, then, do you thus resolve and engage your hearts to walk
   with God. And for your direction--

   1. Let it be the resolution of the heart, rather than the tongue: Jer.
   xxx. 21, Who is this that engageth his heart?' And Acts xi. 23, He
   exhorted them with purpose of heart to cleave to the Lord.' Our
   resolution is not to be determined and judged of so much by the course
   of our language as by the bent of our heart. Empty promises signify
   nothing unless they are the result of the heart's determination: Deut.
   v. 28, 29, The people hath said well,' saith God, all that the Lord
   hath said, we will do. Oh, that they had such a heart within them!'
   Otherwise the duty hath no root, unless it be a fixed determination of
   the soul.

   2. Let it not be a weak, broken, but full resolution. Cold wishes are
   easily overcome by the love of the world: Acts xxvi. 28, Almost thou
   persuadest me to be a Christian.' That will not do, unless we be
   altogether. Carnal men, though they are not converted, yet they have a
   kind of half turn; they have good wishes on a sudden upon a lively
   sermon; they would, but they will not. There needs a strong bent of
   heart. Bad purposes are more easily resolved and performed than good;
   Satan, the world, and the flesh do not hinder, but further them; so
   that good resolutions need to be thoroughly made: 1 Chron. xxii. 19,
   Now set your heart and your soul to seek the Lord your God.' When the
   heart is fixed by a persevering durable purpose, grace possesses it.

   3. Let it not be a rash but a serious resolution, all difficulties
   being well weighed. In a fit or pang of devotion men will resolve for
   God, but it is soon gone: Josh. xxiv. 19, 20, We will serve the Lord,
   for he is our God: and Joshua said, Ye cannot serve the Lord, for he is
   an holy God, he is a jealous God;' that is, do you consider what you
   say? When you have weighty reasons and considerations to bear you up,
   you are more likely to hold. Sit down and count the charges; if you
   resolve for God, see what it is like to cost you, and consider where it
   is likely to fail, what difficulties you are most likely to meet
   withal, what lusts are most apt to break your purpose.

   4. It must be a thorough, absolute, and peremptory resolution. Whatever
   it cost you, resolve to part with all for the pearl of price, Mat.
   xiii. 46, 47, and take Christ for better for worse. A marriage may be
   almost made, but there is one article they stick at, and it is broken
   off; so some are at the very point of giving up themselves to God, but
   there is one article they stick at; it is not an absolute resolution.

   5. Let it be a present, and not a future resolution: Ps. xxvii. 8, When
   thou saidst, Seek ye my face;' like a quick echo he returns upon God,
   Thy face, Lord, will I seek.' As soon as you hear God's voice, before
   the heart grow cold again, it is good to resolve; for after wards it is
   but a cheat to put off importunity of conscience for the present.

   6. Let it be a resolution made in a sense of your own insufficiency,
   and with dependence upon Christ, not in a confidence of your own
   strength. Peter went forth in a confidence of his own resolution,
   Though all men forsake thee, yet will not I;' but how soon did he
   miscarry! Resolve in God's strength: Ps. cxix. 8, I will walk in the
   way of thy statutes: forsake me not utterly.' If God forsake you, all
   comes to nothing; therefore in and by God's strength resolve for God.

   Secondly, The matter of the resolution, The way of thy commandments.'
   Which we may consider either simply and absolutely in itself, or with
   respect to the resolution. With respect to the resolution ob serve, the
   matter is good he resolves upon. Some will resolve upon a course of
   sin, as they, Acts xxiii. 12, that bound themselves under a curse to
   kill Paul. In this case a vow is a bond of iniquity. Many will bind
   themselves never to forgive their neighbour such an offence. Again, the
   matter is necessary. It is contrary to Christian liberty needlessly to
   bind ourselves where God hath left us free. Many will in some
   indifferent things bind themselves, make rash and unnecessary vows, as
   to play no more at such a game, drink no more in such a house or
   company. Alas! what doth this do to cure the heart? This is but like
   the stopping of one leak in a ruinous ship that is ready to fall in
   pieces. Resolution is for the weighty things of Christianity, or
   cleaving to God in a course of obedience, not for some by-matters.
   Resolve on the most necessary work. Again, this resolution is
   propounded universally, indefinitely, in the way of God's
   commandments,' whatever shall appear to be the will of God. When our
   consent is bounded with reservations, we do not come up to the mind of
   God, and that will bring you but half way to heaven. He that is half
   holy, half religious, will be but half saved. Paul gives God a blank,
   and bids him write his terms: Acts ix. 6, Lord, what wilt thou have me
   to do?' So we must submit ourselves to all the ways of God without
   exception. Thus we may consider it as it falls under a resolution, The
   way of thy commandments.'

   But consider the expression absolutely, why are the commandments called
   a way?

   1. There is an end for which man was appointed, and that was to seek
   after true happiness. All desire to be happy by an inclination of
   nature, for hereunto were we appointed by God. Many say, Who will show
   us any good?' Ps. iv. 6; but men's practice is contrary, they live as
   if their end were to be miserable.

   2. This true happiness lieth in the enjoyment of God; that is the great
   end of reasonable creatures, angels and men, actively to glorify God,
   and to enjoy him: other creatures were made to glorify him objectively,
   but not to enjoy him.

   3. For the compassing this end there is a way; for every end is
   attained by the means. What is this way? God's commandments: Eccles.
   xii. 13, Fear God, and keep his commandments; for this is the whole
   duty of man.' That was the result of Solomon's critical search in and
   about the ways of true happiness; he found that a constant, uniform,
   universal obedience was the only way to true happiness.

   4. The commands of God are legal and evangelical: they are both to be
   regarded:--(1.) The evangelical commands come first into consideration
   by the fallen creature; there the great command is to believe in
   Christ, John vi. 29, 1 John iii. 23. To believe in Christ is the only
   way to the Father. Then (2.) The moral law, that is the rule of our
   duty, without which we can never be saved, Rom. x. 14.

   Use. Well, then, let me press you to consideration and resolution. (1.)
   Consideration, that we may think of our end, and think of our way, and
   may not go on as beasts, without any recollection. Luke xv. 17: We
   never come to ourselves till we consider the end why we were born and
   why God sent us into the world. Whence am I? why do I live here? To
   delight myself in the creature, to wallow in pleasures, or to look
   after communion with God? We live but as beasts, not as men, till we
   return and remember our creator, in the enjoyment of whom is our only
   happiness. (2.) Then come to resolution; there is intentio, electio,
   consensus, and imperium; all these should be fixed after we have
   considered for what am I made? what is the way I am to walk? The first
   act of the soul is intentio; that belongs to the last end; surely this
   must be my scope, that God may be my portion. The next act is electio,
   or choice; that belongs to the means. Now the great means is Christ
   Jesus, he is the way to the Father. Oh, let me choose him that I may
   enjoy God for my portion! The next act is consensus, the will and
   understanding together; there is a consent to the terms.
   Notwithstanding all the conditions upon which these means are to be
   had, yet there is a full consent of the will to use them, so a consent
   to take Christ upon his own terms. After this there is imperium, a
   command for an industrious prosecution; this shall be my business, this
   I will look after. There should be a decree in our souls for God; God
   is my scope, Christ my way; I must take him; I will go about this work,
   walk in this way, that I may at length enjoy him.

   Fourthly, The last circumstance is the manner, I will run the way,' &c.
   By running is meant cheerful, ready, and zealous observance of God's
   precepts. It is not go or walk, but run. They that would come to their
   journey's end must run in the way of God's commandments. It noteth
   speedy or a ready obedience without delay. We must begin with God
   betimes. Alas! when we should be at the goal, we scarce set forth many
   of us. And it noteth earnestness; when a man's heart is set upon a
   thing, he thinks he can never soon enough do it. And this is running,
   when we are vehement and earnest upon the enjoyment of God and Christ
   in the way of obedience. And it notes, again, when the heart freely
   offereth itself to God. Now this running is very necessary, as it is
   the fruit of effectual calling. When the Lord speaks of effectual
   calling, the issue of it is running; when he speaks of the conversion
   of the Gentiles, Nations that know thee not shall run to thee;' and
   Draw me, and we will run after thee;' and In the day of thy power thy
   people shall be a willing people.' There are no slow motions, but when
   God draws there is a speedy, an earnest motion of the soul. And this
   running, as it is the fruit of effectual calling, so it is very
   needful; for cold and faint motions are soon overborne with every
   difficulty and temptation: Heb. xii. 1, Let us run with patience the
   race that is set before us.' When a man hath a mind to do such a thing;
   though he be hindered and jostled, he takes it patiently; he goes on,
   and cannot stay to debate the business. A slow motion is easily
   stopped, whereas a swift one bears down that which opposeth it; so when
   men run and are not tired in the service of God. And then the prize
   calls for running: 1 Cor. ix. 24, So run that ye may obtain.' There is
   a prize, which is eternal life in Christ Jesus, the reward or crown
   which he keepeth for us in heaven. They that ran for a gar land of
   flowers in the Isthmic games--the apostle alludes to them--how would
   they diet themselves that they might be in breath and heart to win a
   poor garland of flowers! There is a crown of glory set before us,
   therefore we should so run that we may obtain, and be temperate in all
   things; we should keep down the body, deny fleshly lusts, and the like.

   Use. To reprove faint cold motions in the things of God. Many, instead
   of running, lie down, or, which is worse, go back again, or at best but
   a very slow pace. Christ is running to you to snatch you out of the
   fire, and will you not run towards him? When we have abated the fervour
   of our motion towards God, then we lie open to temptation; therefore
   let us not loiter; run, it is for a crown. If heaven be worth nothing,
   lie still; but if it be, run. Wicked men run fast to hell, as if they
   did strive who should be soonest there; bewail your slowness and
   lameness in obedience.

SERMON XXXVI.

   Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes, and I shall keep it unto the
   end.--Ver. 33.

   THE man of God had promised to run the way of God's commandments; but
   being conscious of many swervings, beggeth God further to teach him.

   In the words two things are observable:--

   1. A prayer for grace.

   2. A promise made upon supposition of obtaining the grace asked. He
   promiseth--

   [1.] Diligence and accuracy of practice, I will keep it.

   [2.] Perseverance, unto the end.

   First, In the prayer for grace observe--

   1. The person to whom he prays, O Lord.

   2. The person for whom, teach me.

   3. The grace for which he prayeth, to be taught.

   4. The object of this teaching, the way of God's statutes.

   The teaching which he beggeth is not speculative, but practical; to
   learn how to walk in the way of God.

   1. David, a man after God's own heart, maketh this prayer. The more
   love any have to God, the more they desire to know his ways. Carnal men
   are of another spirit; they say, Job xxi. 14, Depart from us; we desire
   not the knowledge of thy ways.' The more ignorant the more quiet. They
   that love their lusts cannot heartily desire the knowledge of those
   truths which will trouble them in the following of their lusts. We
   often consult with our affections about our opinions; and where we have
   a mind to hate, we have no desire to know, Ordinary professors, a
   little knowledge serveth their turn, some few obvious truths, but
   others, such as David, follow on to know the Lord. David, that had a
   singular measure of knowledge already, yet there is no end of his
   desire in this psalm; and shall we be contented as if we needed no
   more?

   2. Consider David, a prophet, a teacher, a penman of scripture. There
   was some knowledge which the prophets got by ordinary means, and some
   by immediate revelation; as Daniel by vision, and Daniel by reading of
   books, Dan. vii. 2, ix. 2; either by a new revelation, or by the study
   of what was already revealed. And if extraordinary men were bound to
   the ordinary duties of God's service as the means of their improvement
   and growth in grace, such as reading, prayer, hearing, meditation, use
   of seals, &c., surely none can plead exemption or conceit themselves to
   be above duties. Now, that they were thus bound we find by David's
   prayer for knowledge, Daniel's reading of books, namely that of
   Jeremiah, and all of them meditating or inquiring diligently what
   manner of salvation should ensue: 1 Peter i. 10, 11, Of which salvation
   the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of
   the grace that should come unto you; searching what or what manner of
   time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it
   testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that
   should follow;' meditating and prying into the meaning of that
   salvation which by the motion of the Spirit they held forth to others,
   labouring to make these truths their own, and to get their hearts
   affected therewith. In their prophetic revelations they were
   pheromenoi, 2 Peter i. 21, forcibly moved by the Spirit, and carried
   beyond their intention, and the line of their natural strength, but in
   other things they got knowledge by the same means that we do, and as
   believers were to stir up the gifts and graces which they had in the
   ordinary way of duty, waiting and crying for the influences of the
   Lord's grace. You must distinguish, then, of what they did when they
   acted as prophets and when they acted as believers.

   3. David, that had means external sufficient to direct him in the way
   of God, as the scriptures then written, the ordinances of the law, and
   the expositions of the scribes, yet beggeth God to teach him. So must
   we beg God to teach us, whatever means we have. It is true we have an
   advantage above the Old Testament church, as we have their helps and
   more, and the doctrine of salvation is now clearer, and the gifts and
   graces of the Spirit more plentifully dispensed since the price of
   redemption is actually paid, than before, when God gave out grace and
   glory only upon trust; yet still we are to go to God for his teaching,
   because the means are not successful unless he join his influence;
   especially to give us this practical knowledge, teaching in order to
   keeping the way of God's statutes. I say, though we have the word, and
   many pastors and teachers better gifted than in the Old Testament, Eph.
   iv. 11, yet God must be our teacher still, if we mean to profit; for
   Paul may plant, and Apollos may water, but God giveth the increase,' 1
   Cor. iii. 6. To seek knowledge in the means with the neglect of God
   well never succeed well with you; as we ministers must not rest upon
   our work, but pray much for success (bene orasse est bene
   studuisse--Luther), so you hearers must not rest in the fruit of our
   studies, but still beg God to teach you every truth.

   But all this will be more evidently made out in the following points.

   Doct. 1. Divine teaching is necessary for all those that would walk in
   the way of God's statutes.

   1. We have lost our way to true happiness. Adam lost it, and all
   mankind in him; ever since we have been wandering up and down: Ps. xiv.
   3, They are all gone aside,' i.e., gone out of the way of holiness as
   it leadeth to true happiness: Eccles. vii. 29, God hath made man
   upright, but they have sought out many inventions;' wander in a maze.
   Man at first, that had perfect wisdom to discern the way to true
   happiness, and ability to pursue it, now is full of crooked counsels,
   being darkened with ignorance in his mind, and abominable errors and
   mistakes, and seconded with lusts and passions.

   2. We can never find it of ourselves till God reveal it to us: He hath
   showed thee, man, what is good,' Micah vi. 8. It is well for man that
   he hath God for his teacher, who hath given him a stated rule by which
   good and evil may be determined.

   [1.] Because there are many things which nature would never reveal to
   him; as the whole doctrine of redemption by Christ. The book of the
   creatures discovereth the mercy of God, but giveth not the least hint
   of the way how that mercy should come unto us, speaketh nothing of God
   incarnate, two natures in Christ's person, the two covenants, the way
   of salvation by Christ's death, &c. These could never be known by
   natural reason, for all these things proceed from the mere motion of
   God's will, without any other cause moving there unto than his own love
   and compassion: John iii. 16, God so loved the world that he gave his
   only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,
   but have everlasting life.' And how could any man divine what God
   purposed in his heart, unless he himself revealed it?

   [2.] Because those things that nature teacheth it teacheth but darkly,
   and with little satisfaction, without the help of scriptures; as that
   there is one God, the first cause of all, omnipotent, wise, righteous,
   good, and that it is reasonable he should be served; that reasonable
   creatures have immortal souls, and so die not as the beasts; that there
   is no true happiness in these things wherein men ordinarily seek it;
   that since virtue and vice receive not suitable recompenses here, there
   must be punishment and reward after this life; that men live justly, do
   as they would be done to, be sober and temperate; that reason be not
   enslaved to sensual appetite; all which nature revealeth but darkly: so
   that the wisest men that have lived according to this light in one
   thing or other have been found fools: Rom. i. 22, Professing themselves
   wise, they became fools.' But all these things are clearly revealed in
   scripture, which discovers the nature and way of worshipping the true
   God, what that reward and punishment after this life is, and the right
   way of obtaining the one and eschewing the other, with weighty
   arguments to enforce these things.

   [3.] That we may have assurance that the worship which we give to God
   is pleasing to him, there must be a revelation of his will; otherwise,
   when we have tired ourselves in an endless maze of superstitions, he
   might turn us off with Who hath required these things at your hands?'
   Isa. i. 12. Therefore, for our security and assurance it concerneth us
   to have a stated rule under God's own hand, and God must be both author
   and object of worship.

   3. Besides the external revelation there must be an inward teaching:
   They shall all be taught of God,' John vi. 45; not all the prophets
   that wrote scripture, but all that come to Christ for salvation. And
   this is prophesied of that time when the canon and rule of faith should
   be most complete; then there will be still a need that they should be
   taught of God before their hearts be drawn into Christ. As the book of
   the scriptures is necessary to expound the book of the creatures, so
   and much more is the light of the Spirit to expound the book of the
   scriptures. Others teach the ear, but God openeth the heart. The rule
   is one thing, and the guide is another. The means were never intended
   to take off our dependence upon God, but to engage it rather, that we
   may look up for his blessing: 1 Cor. iii. 6, I have planted, Apollos
   watered, but God gave the increase;' 2 Cor. iv. 6, God, that commanded
   (ho eipon) light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts,
   to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of
   Jesus Christ.' Though the gospel hath enough in it to evidence itself
   to the consciences of men, yet God must make use of his creating power
   before this light can break in upon our hearts with any efficacy and
   influence: The law is light,' Prov. vi. 23. Yet not comprehended by
   darkness: John i. 5, The light shineth in darkness, and the darkness
   comprehended it not,' which rests in the hearts of all men that remain
   in their natural condition. It is not enough to see any object to have
   the light of the sun, unless we have the light of the eye. The
   scripture is our external light, as the sun is to the world; the
   understanding is our internal light. Now this eye is become blind in
   all natural men, and in the best it is most imperfect; therefore the
   eyes of the understanding must be opened by the spirit of wisdom and
   revelation, Eph. i. 17, 18. Though truths be plainly revealed by the
   Spirit of God in scripture, yet there must be a removal of that natural
   darkness and blindness that is upon our understandings. Outward light
   doth not make the object conspicuous without a faculty of seeing in the
   eye; a blind man cannot see at noonday, nor the sharpest sight at
   midnight. The work of the Spirit is to take off the scales from our
   eyes, that we may see clearly what the scripture speaketh clearly. Now
   scripture is perfected, that is the great work, to strengthen the
   faculty.

   4. This inward teaching must be renewed and continued from day to day,
   or else we shall soon miscarry by our mistakes and prejudices. David is
   often pressing God with this request, Lord, teach me;' which plainly
   showeth that not only novices, but men of great holiness and
   experience, need new direction every day. The shameful miscarriages of
   God's wisest people are enough to show the necessity of this, and the
   many cautions in the word of God do abundantly confirm it: Prov. iii.
   5, 6, Trust in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not to thine own
   understanding; in all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy
   paths.' There is nothing that keepeth up our dependence upon God, and
   should quicken us in our daily prayers, as the sense of this. Many
   times we come to God in the morning, and pray coldly and drowsily,
   because we go forth to the occasions of the day in the presumption of
   our wit; but it is a thousand to one but we smart for our folly before
   the evening come. Alas! such is the in constancy and uncertainty of
   man's understanding, that unless we have continual light and direction
   from God, and he lead us by the hand through all our affairs, passion
   or unbelief, or some carnal affection, will make us stumble and dash
   against one divine precept or another. This concerneth all Christians,
   much more those in public station, whose good or evil is of a more
   universal influence. Such was David. Men of place and power and
   interest had need have this often in their mouths and hearts, Lord,
   teach me the way of thy statutes.' Homer has a notable saying in his
   Odyssey--

     "Toios ga`r no'os estin epichthonion anthro'pon,
     Hoion ep' emar a'gesi pate`r andronte theonte."

   See Casaubon, Ep. 702,--a most divine sentence from a heathen poet,
   that mortal man should not be proud of his wit, for he hath no more
   understanding of his affairs than God giveth him from day to day. A
   sentence so admired by the heathens, that many of them transcribed it
   in their writings with admiration; as Clemens Alexandrinus speaketh of
   Archilochus, who, as he took other things from Homer, so his putting it
   into his verse thus--

     "Toios ga`r anthro'poisi thumo`s, Glauke, Lepti'nes pai,
     Thnetois opoi'on Zeus eph' eme`ren a'goi."

   Augustine De Civitate Dei, telleth us, lib. v. cap. 8. Cicero rendered
   it into Latin verse thus, though with some loss of the sense--

     "Tales sunt hominum mentes quales pater ipse,
     Jupiter auctiferas lustravit lumine terras."

   I quote all this to show you how precious such a hint was to heathens,
   as expressing a great deal of reason; and shall not we Christians wait
   upon God for the continual direction of his Spirit?

   Now there is a twofold reason for this:--

   1. Because this actuateth our knowledge, which would otherwise lie
   asleep in the habit; and then, though we are wise in generals, we
   should be to seek for direction in particular cases, or at least not
   have such a lively sense of God's will as to check the present
   temptations we meet with in the course of our affairs, and do too often
   induce us to miscarry. The temptation being dexterously managed by
   Satan, and entertained by our present thoughts, will easily overbear a
   latent principle long ago received, unless it be afresh revived and set
   a-work by God's Spirit; therefore we need that the Spirit should be our
   monitor, and cause truths formerly delivered to return with fresh force
   upon the heart. And indeed it is his main work to bring things to our
   remembrance,' John xiv. 26, and to blow up our light and knowledge into
   an actual resistance of whatever is contrary to the will of God, or to
   furnish us with seasonable thoughts in every business and temptation.

   2. We have but a glimmering light when we are blinded with passions,
   and are in some sort ignorant of what we know, cannot deduce those
   conclusions which are evidently contained in known and avowed
   principles. Hagar could not see the well before her eyes, by reason of
   her passion and grief, till God opened her eyes: Gen. xxi. 19, And God
   opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water.' The ground was not
   opened to cause the fountain to bubble up, but her eyes were opened to
   see it. And Calvin giveth the reason why she saw it not, because dolore
   attonita, quod expositum erat oculis non cernebat--things at hand
   cannot be seen when the mind is diverted by the impression of some
   strong passion; and it is true of the eyes of the mind; we do not see
   what we see, being overcome by love, or fear, or hope, or anger, or
   some cloud that interposeth from the passions. As David, when he
   fumbled about God's providence, being blinded by the prospering of the
   wicked, calleth himself beast for not discerning his duty in so plain a
   case: Ps. lxxiii. 22, So foolish was I, and ignorant, and as a beast
   before thee.' In the perplexities of his mind he could not see clear
   principles of faith which before he had sufficiently learned, but could
   not then make use of for the settling and composing his heart.

   Use 1 is for information.

   1. The difference between the way of God and the way of sin. We have
   need of none to teach us to do evil--Vitia etiam sine magistro
   discuntur; we have that from nature; but in the way of God we must be
   taught and taught again; God must be our teacher and daily monitor.

   2. It informs us that as to knowledge and direction there must be much
   done. Poor man, lying in the darkness and shadow of death, it was
   necessary for him--

   [1.] That some doctrine should be revealed by God, by which he might
   understand how God stood affected towards him, and he ought to be
   affected towards God.

   [2.] That this doctrine being revealed by God, it should be kept safe
   and sound, free from oblivion and corruption, in some public and
   authentic record, especially in these last times, when not only the
   canon is enlarged, but the church propagated far and near, and ob
   noxious to so many calamities, and men are short-lived, and there are
   not such authentic witnesses to preserve the credit of a divine
   revelation.

   [3.] That this writing and record be known to come from God's own hand
   by some infallible proof, to the end that it may be entertained with
   the more reverence.

   [4.] To own this authority, and discern God's mind, we need a suit able
   faculty, or a heart disposed by the Holy Ghost to receive the proof
   which God offereth, namely, that we should be renewed in the spirit of
   our minds, and open our eyes.

   [5.] It is not enough to own our rule, but we must be continually
   excited to study it, that we may come to a saving measure of the
   knowledge of God's mind in the word.

   [6.] After some knowledge our ignorance is apt to return upon us,
   unless the Holy Ghost do still enlighten us and warn us of our duty
   upon all occasions.

   Use 2. In the sincerity of your hearts go to God for his teaching. God
   is pleased with the request: 1 Kings iii. 9, 10, Give therefore thy
   servant an understanding heart, to judge thy people, that I may discern
   between good and bad; for who is able to judge this thy so great a
   people? And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this
   thing.' Oh! beg it of God.

   1. The way of God's statutes is worthy to be found by all.

   2. So hard to be found and kept by any.

   3. It is so dangerous to miss it, that this should quicken us to be
   earnest with God.

   1. It is so worthy to be found; it is the way to eternal life and to
   escape eternal death; and in matters of such a concernment no diligence
   can be too much: Prov. xv. 24, The way of life is above to the wise, to
   depart from hell beneath.' It is the way that leadeth to life and true
   happiness.

   2. It is so hard to find and keep; it is a narrow way: Mat. vii. 13,
   14, Enter ye in at the strait gate; for wide is the gate and broad is
   the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there be that go in
   thereat; because strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth
   unto life, and few there be that find it.' There is defect, here
   excess. A gracious spirit, that would keep with God in all things, is
   sensible of the difficulty; there are many ways that lead to hell, but
   one way to heaven.

   3. It is so dangerous to miss it in whole or in part; in whole, you are
   undone for ever; in part, in every false religion such disadvantages,
   so little of God's presence and the comforts of his Spirit: 1 Cor. iii.
   15, If any man's work shall be burnt, he shall suffer loss, but he
   himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.' A man should look after the
   most clear and safe way to heaven.

   Doct. 2. That divine teaching is earnestly desired by God's children.

   How often doth David repeat this request! These expressions are strange
   to us, who, as soon as we have gotten a little knowledge, think we know
   as much as we need to know, and are wise enough to guide our way
   without further direction; but they are not so to the people of God.

   Reas. 1. It is a hard matter to understand a thing spiritually and as
   it ought to be understood. There is an understanding of things
   literally, and a spiritual discerning: 1 Cor. ii. 14, A natural man
   receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness
   unto him, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually
   discerned.' There is a knowing things at random and by a general
   knowledge, and a knowing things as we ought to know: 1 Cor. viii. 2, If
   any man think that he knoweth anything, he knoweth nothing yet as he
   ought to know.' There is a knowing the truth as it is in Jesus: Eph.
   iv. 21, If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him,
   as the truth is in Jesus.' It is not every sort of know ledge that is
   saving; a man may go to hell with speculative light; that never
   reacheth the heart: such as is practical and operative, the scripture
   presseth knowledge, and the modus of it.

   2. God's children are sensible of their own insufficiency, and so of
   the need of a constant dependence upon God; sound and saving know ledge
   is ever humble. They have clearer light than others, and so best see
   their own defects: Prov. xxx. 2, Surely I am more brutish than any man,
   and have not the understanding of a man;' and are, too, most sensible
   of corruptions, and see most of the excellency of the object: 1 Cor.
   viii. 2, If any man think that he knoweth anything, he knoweth nothing
   yet as he ought to know.' They study their own hearts, and so are
   conscious to many weaknesses; they know how easily they are misled by
   the wiles of Satan and the darkness of their own hearts; whereas a
   presumptuous formalist goeth on boldly, and in the confidence of his
   own wit runneth headlong into temptation.

   3. Their strong affection to knowledge; they desire to know more, for
   there is more still to be learned in the word of God. Though taught in
   part, they see what a small measure of knowledge they have attained
   unto; till they attain the beatifical vision they are never satisfied:
   Hosea vi. 3, Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord;'
   still increasing and bettering their notions concerning the things of
   God.

   4. Their great care that they may not go astray, nor offend in mat ter,
   or manner, or principle, and end. They whose hearts are set upon exact
   walking would fain know what God would have them to do in every action
   and in every circumstance: Lord, teach me; let thy Holy

   Spirit guide me, and direct me in performing acceptable obedience to
   thee. It was David's resolution, ver. 32, I will run the way of thy
   commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart.' Now we have his prayer
   for direction in this verse, Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy
   statutes;' I would know it that I may keep it. It is a very trouble
   some condition to a child of God when he is in the dark, and knoweth
   not what to do, and is forced to walk every step by guess, and cannot
   find the ground sure under him. The conflict between duty and danger
   doth not trouble so much as between duty and duty: John xii. 35, He
   that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.' Oh! it is a sad
   judgment to wander in a maze of confusions, and to be like those that
   thought to go to Dothan, and found themselves in Samaria, 2 Kings vi.
   20.

   Well, then, the use is, Have we this temper of God's people? Do we look
   after spiritual knowledge, such as will not only store the head with
   notions, but enter upon the heart? Are we sensible of our weakness and
   Satan's wiles, and that God, that hath begun the work, must perfect it?
   Do we make it our happiness to grow rich in know ledge, and better our
   apprehensions concerning God and the things of God? Would we understand
   every point of duty that we may fulfil it? As face answereth to face in
   water, so should heart to heart, the heart of one child of God to
   another.

   Doct. 3. All that teaching that we expect or get from God must still be
   directed to practice: Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes, and I
   shall keep it unto the end.'

   1. This is God's intention in teaching, therefore should be our end in
   learning. The end of sound knowledge is obedience: Deut. iv. 5, 6,
   Behold I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the Lord my
   God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to
   possess it: keep therefore and do them, for this is thy wisdom.' Others
   do little more than learn them by rote, when they know them only to
   talk of them, or fashion their notions and plausible opinions that they
   may hang together.

   2. It is not the knowing, but obeying, will make us happy. We desire to
   know the way that we may come to the end of the journey; to inquire the
   way and sit still will not further us: Blessed are they that hear the
   word and keep it,' Luke xi. 28;' He is in the way of life that keepeth
   instruction,' Prov. x. 17. None but desire to be happy; walk in God's
   way; he goeth on right that submitteth to the directions of the word.

   3. All the comfort and sweetness is in keeping: Ps. xix. 11, In keeping
   thy commandments there is a great reward;' many sweet experiences.
   Notions breed a delectation when they are right, but nothing comparable
   to practice.

   4. He that will do shall know: John vii. 17, If any man will do his
   will, he shall know the doctrine whether it be of God.' Such as truly
   fear God, and make conscience of every known duty in their practice,
   have God's promise that they shall be able to discern and distinguish
   between doctrine and doctrine; others provoke God to withhold light
   from them. Not that the godly are infallible. Alas! the best men's
   humours and fleshly passions do often mislead them, but this is the
   fruit of their careless walking.

   Use 1. Is to reprove them that desire knowledge, but only to inform
   their judgments or satisfy their curiosity, not to govern their hearts
   in the fear of God, or to reform their practices. Such are foolish
   builders: Mat. vii. 26, 27, Every one that heareth these sayings of
   mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man that
   built his house upon the sand; and the rain descended, and the floods
   came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house, and it fell, and
   great was the fall of it.' These do but increase their own
   condemnation: Luke xii. 47, That servant which knew his lord's will and
   prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be
   beaten with many stripes.' Like many that study maps, not to travel,
   but only to talk and understand how countries are situated.

   Use 2. It directeth us in our desires of knowledge, what should be our
   scope. Come with a fixed resolution to obey, and refer all to practice.
   Knowledge is the means, doing is the end: Deut. v. 31, I will speak
   unto thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments
   which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I
   give them to possess it.' Media accipiunt amabilitatem, ordinem et
   mensuram a fine--the desire, measure, order of the means are to be
   esteemed as regulated by the end; therefore still prize this knowledge,
   so far forth as it directs to practice.

   Doct. 4. In this practice we must be sincere and constant. I will keep
   it'--

   1. Having such a help as this continual direction.

   2. Such an engagement as this condescension to direct and warn a poor
   creature. And to the end,' that is to the end of my life; there is no
   other period to our obedience but death. The Greek hath it, dia`
   panto`s, continually.' The word doth properly signify the heel or sole
   of the foot; by traduction thence, the end of a thing, and some times a
   reward and recompense.

   [1.] It is not enough to begin a good course, but we must go on in it,
   if we mean to reach the goal, else all our labour is lost; the end
   crowneth the work.

   [2.] God, that made us begin, doth also make us to continue to the end.
   Is the beginning from God, the end and perfection from us? This is to
   ascribe that which is less perfect to God, and that which is more
   perfect to us.

SERMON XXXVII.

   Give me understanding and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it
   with my whole heart.--Ver. 34.

   IN these words you have--(1.) A prayer, give me understanding. (2.) A
   promise, and I shall keep thy law. (3.) The promise amplified, by
   expressing the exactness and sincerity of that obedience, yea, I shall
   observe it with my whole heart. The first point is--

   That there needeth a great deal of understanding to keep God's law.

   1. That he may know his way, and understand what God commandeth and
   forbiddeth; for it is the wisdom of a man to understand his way, and to
   know the laws according to which he liveth: Col. i. 9, 10, Filled with
   the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding,
   that ye may walk worthy of God unto all well-pleasing.' We have such
   great obligations to God, both in point of hope and gratitude, that we
   have reason to study our duty exactly, that we may not displease him
   and cross his will in anything. We take it for granted that a man
   should comply with the will of him upon whom he dependeth. We have all
   and look for all from him; therefore we should walk worthy of God unto
   all well-pleasing, which we can never do without much knowledge and
   understanding; therefore we should search out the mind of God in
   everything.

   2. To avoid the snares that are laid for us in the course of our duty
   to God. There is a crafty devil and a deceitful heart; so that a man
   that would walk with God had need have his eyes about him. For the
   wiles of Satan: Eph. vi. 11, Put on the whole armour of God, that ye
   may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.' His enterprises
   or devices: 2 Cor. ii. 11, Lest Satan should get an advantage of us,
   for we are not ignorant of his devices.' He is ready to entrap us and
   ensnare us by plausible temptations; he suiteth the bait to every
   appetite. Then our own hearts: Jer. xvii. 9, The heart is deceitful
   above all things, and desperately wicked, who can, know it?' There is a
   deceiver in our own bosoms, that will represent good under the notion
   of evil, and evil under the notion of good; that will cheat us of
   present duties by future promises. And therefore Ingeniosa res est esse
   Christianum. He that would keep God's law had need be a very
   understanding man, that Satan entrap him not, and his own heart deceive
   him not, and so he smart for his folly: Walk circumspectly, not as
   fools but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil,' Eph.
   v. 15.

   3. That he may respect things according to their order and places, and
   give them precedency in his care and practice as their worth deserveth,
   which certainly belongeth to understanding or wisdom to do. As (1.)
   That God should be owned before man, and served and respected before
   our neighbour or ourselves; for God hath a right in us antecedent to
   that of the creature: Acts v. 29, We ought to obey God rather than
   men.' Many times God's children are put to it, divided between duty and
   duty; duty to their parents, duty to their magistrates, and duty to
   God. Now it requireth understanding how to sort both duties. When the
   inferior power crosseth the will of the superior, the higher duty must
   take place, and we must dispense with our duty to men, that we may be
   faithful to God. Alas! the corruption of nature would teach us to do
   otherwise; we love ourselves more than our neighbour, and our neighbour
   more than God. Out of self-interest we comply with the lusts of men,
   and in complying with the lusts of men make bold with God. This wisdom
   every one that would keep God's law must learn, that we are bound to
   none so much as to God, from whom we have life, and breath, and all
   things; that none can reward our obedience so surely, so largely, as
   God, who can bear us out when men fail; that none can punish our
   disobedience so much as God. If these considerations were more in our
   hearts, we would not sin so boldly, nor serve God so fearfully and
   cowardly as usually we do, nor comply with men to the wrong of our
   souls. We may refuse obedience in a particular instance where we do not
   refuse subjection. (2.) That heaven is to be preferred before earth,
   and the salvation of our souls before the interests and concernments of
   our bodies: Mat. vi. 33, Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his
   righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.' And
   whosoever fail in this point of wisdom are very fools: Luke xii. 20,
   But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night shall thy soul be required
   of thee; then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided?'
   There should be no delays in heavenly matters. We busy ourselves about
   other things, and defer our care for eternity from day to day; but this
   should be sought before every other thing. (3.) That present affliction
   is to be chosen rather than future, and temporal rather than eternal. A
   wise man would have the best at last, for to fall from happiness is the
   utmost degree of misery--Miserum est fuisse beatum. And therefore
   better suffer now, with hopes of reward in another world, than take
   pleasure now, to endure pains to come: 2 Tim. ii. 3, Thou therefore
   endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.' It is better to do
   so than to have all our hopes spent: Son, in thy lifetime thou
   receivedst thy good things,' Luke xvi. 25. That which is present is
   temporal, that which is to come is eternal: 2 Cor. iv. 18, While we
   look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not
   seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which
   are not seen are eternal. The good and evil of the present state is
   soon over. Now we stand not upon a short evil, so we may compass a
   great good. (4.) That things of profit and pleasure must give place to
   things that belong to godliness, virtue, and honesty; for the bastard
   good must give place to the true, real good. Profit and pleasure are
   but bastard goods. They are counted understanding men in the world that
   make pleasure give way to profit; therefore Solomon saith, Where there
   are no oxen the crib is clean, yet there is much gain by the labour of
   the ox.' I am sure he is an understanding man before God that maketh
   both give way to honesty and godliness; for the same reason that will
   sway us to make pleasure give way to profit will also teach us to make
   profit give way to the interest of grace. As for instance, that
   pleasure is a base thing as being the happiness of beasts; so is
   profit, as being the happiness of the children of this world, in
   contradistinction to holiness, the perfection of the next. The pleasure
   of sense is only in this life, so is worldly gain only serviceable in
   our pilgrimage; pleasure in excess destroyeth profit; so doth profit
   destroy grace. As the world scorneth a man that hath wasted an estate
   upon his pleasures, so do God and angels him that, from the abundance
   of his wealth, maketh havoc of a good conscience, and neglecteth things
   to come: Godliness is the great gain,' 1 Tim. vi. 6. (5.) That the
   greatest suffering is to be chosen before the least sin. In sufferings,
   the offence is done to us; in sin, the offence is done to God. The evil
   of suffering is but for a moment, the evil of sin for ever; in
   suffering we lose the favour of men, in sin we lose the favour of God;
   suffering bringeth inconvenience upon the body, sin upon the soul;
   suffering is only evil in our sense, sin whether we feel it, yea or
   nay. It requireth spiritual wisdom and understanding to choose of evils
   the least, as well as of goods the best: Moses, Heb. xi. 25, choosing
   rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the
   pleasures of sin for a season.' (6.) That a general good is to be
   chosen before a particular, and that which yieldeth all things rather
   than that which will yield a limited and particular comfort. Riches
   will avail against poverty, and honour against disgrace; but godliness
   is profitable for all things,' 1 Tim. iv. 8; it will yield
   righteousness, comfort, and peace eternal, and food, and raiment,
   maintenance, and eternal life. Now these and many such principles must
   be engrafted in the heart if we would keep God's laws. The
   reasonableness of such propositions in the theory may easily appear;
   but as to practice, we are governed by sense and human passion, which
   judgeth the quite contrary of all this, and causeth us to make bold
   with God because afraid of men, to follow earthly things with the
   greatest delight and earnestness, and spiritual things in a formal and
   careless manner, to be all for the present and nothing for things to
   come, and to sell the birthright for a mess of pottage, to make a wound
   in our souls to avoid a scratch in our bodies, and for a little
   particular contentment to neglect the things of God.

   4. Understanding is necessary, that we may judge aright of time and
   place and manner of doing, that we may do not only things good but
   well, where to go, where to stand still; as it is said, they sought of
   God a right way, Isa. viii. 21, [12] and David behaved himself wisely
   in. all that he did, 1 Sam. xviii. 5. It is for the glory of God, and
   the credit of religion, and the peace of our own souls, that we should
   regard circumstances as well as actions, and discern time and judgment,
   that we do not destroy what we would build up. Therefore understanding
   is necessary. See further ver. 98 of this psalm.

   5. Because our affections answer our understanding. If we understand
   not, how can we believe? If we believe not, how can we love? If we love
   not, how can we do? Knowledge, persuasion, affection, practice, these
   follow one another, where the faculties of the soul are rightly
   governed, and kept in a due subordination. Indeed, by the fall the
   order is subverted: Titus iii. 3, Serving divers lusts and pleasures.'
   Objects strike upon the senses, sense moveth the fancy, fancy moveth
   the bodily spirits, the bodily spirits move the affections, and these
   blind the mind and lead the will captive. But a true understanding
   makes us more steadfast.

   Now all these considerations do show us our need of understanding, and
   that a Christian should be prudent, not headstrong and precipitant,
   Like horse or mule, that have no understanding,' Ps. xxxii. 9, but wise
   and knowing in all principles, actions, and circumstances that belong
   to his duty, if he would honour his profession, and not follow the
   brutish motions of his own heart, but God's direction. Now, if we would
   have understanding, we must--

   1. Attend upon the word; that will make us wise to salvation,' wiser
   than our enemies,' than our teachers,' than the ancients.' Than
   enemies: A man that consulteth not with flesh and blood, but the word
   and rule of his duty, will find plain honesty at length to be the best
   policy. Than teachers: Because he contented not himself with the naked
   rules delivered by them, but laboured with his conscience to make them
   profitable to himself. Than ancients, or men of long study and
   experience. That is a costly wisdom; when men have smarted often, they
   learn by their own harms to be circumspect. If there were no other way
   to be wise than by experience, miserable were man for a long time, and
   would be exposed to hazards and foul dangers before he could get it.
   But now scripture, which is not the result of men's experience, but
   God's wisdom, is not such a long and expensive way.

   2. Use much meditation in debating matters between God and your souls:
   Ps. cxix. 99, I have more understanding than all my teachers, for thy
   testimonies are my meditation;' and 2 Tim. ii. 7, Consider what I say,
   and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.'

   3. Prayer, as David doth here ask it of God. Desire him to remove that
   darkness of spirit which sin hath brought upon you, that you may not
   govern your life by sense and passion, but by his direction: Job xxxii.
   8, There is a spirit in man, but the inspiration of the Almighty giveth
   understanding.' Man hath reason, but to guide it to a spiritual use,
   that is above his power. The Psalmist complaineth of all natural men:
   There is none that understandeth, none that doeth good to no one,' Ps.
   xiv. 2; and Rom. iii. 11, There is none that understandeth, there is
   none that seeketh after God.' Therefore it is God must give
   understanding at first conversion: Acts xvi. 14, God opened the heart
   of Lydia;' and Acts xxvi. 18, To open their eyes, and to turn them from
   darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may
   receive forgiveness of sins,' &c. By a fuller illumination: Eph. i. 17,
   18, That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, that father of glory, may
   give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of
   him, the eyes of your understanding being enlightened,' &c.; otherwise
   we have not a heart to perceive, nor eyes to see, nor ears to hear:
   Deut. xxix. 4, Yet the Lord hath not^given you a heart to perceive, nor
   eyes to see, nor ears to hear unto this day.'

   Secondly, The next thing that I shall observe is this--

   That upon the supposition of this benefit he promiseth obedience, I
   shall keep thy law.

   Doct. They that have understanding given by God will keep his law.

   1. That it is their duty, and they ought so to do, there is no
   question; for all knowledge is given us in order to practice, not to
   satisfy curiosity or feed pride, or to get a fame and reputation with
   men of knowledge and understanding persons, but to order our walk: Col.
   i. 9, 10, For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, cease not
   to pray for you, and to desire that you might be filled with the
   knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; that
   ye might walk worthy of the Lord, unto all pleasing, being fruitful in
   every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God.'

   2. That they will do so is also clear upon a twofold account:--

   [1.] Because answerable to the discovery of good or evil in the

   understanding. There is a prosecution and an aversation in the will;
   for the will doth necessarily follow practicum dictamen, the ultimate
   resolution of the judgment; for it is o'rexis meta` lo'gou, not a
   brutish inclination, but a rational appetite. God hath appointed this
   course to nature; therefore when the judgment cometh to such a
   conclusion as is set down in the 73d Psalm, ver. 28, But it is good for
   me to draw near to God'--not only it is good, but it is good for
   me--the will yieldeth; for conviction of the judgment is the ground of
   practice. I know conviction and conversion differ, and the one may be
   where the other is not. But then it is taken for a partial conviction;
   the mind is not savingly enlightened and thoroughly possessed with the
   truth and worth of heavenly things; the most and greatest sort of men
   have but notions, a weak and literal knowledge about spiritual things,
   and that produceth nothing; they do not live up to the truth which they
   know. Others have besides the notion a naked approbation of things that
   are good. Video meliora proboque, deteriora sequor--they see better
   things and approve them in the abstract; but this doth not come to a
   practicum dictamen; it is good, and good for me, all circumstances
   considered, thus to do. This is the fruit of spiritual evidence and
   demonstration, which always is accompanied with power, 1 Cor. ii. 4.
   Carnal men think it is better for them to keep as they are, being
   blinded with their passions and lusts, though they could wish things
   were otherwise with them. But a godly man's judgment being savingly
   enlightened, determineth it is good, it is better, it is best for me;
   it is better to please God than men, to look after heaven than the
   world, &c. There is a simple approbation of good things, and a
   comparative approbation of them. Simple approbation is when in the
   abstract notion we apprehend Christ and pardon of sins and heaven good;
   but when compared with other things, and considered in the frame of
   Christian doctrine, or according to the terms upon which they may be
   had, they are rejected. Many approve things simply, and in the first
   act of judgment, but disallow them in the second, when they consider
   them as invested with some difficult and unpleasing terms, or compare
   them with pleasure and profit which they must forsake if they would
   obtain them; as the young man in the Gospel esteemeth salvation as a
   thing worthy to be inquired into, but is loath to let go his earthly
   possessions, Mat. xix. 21, 22. He would have these good things at an
   easy rate, without mortifying the flesh or renouncing the world. But a
   godly man, that sits down and counteth the charges, all circumstances
   considered, resolves, It is good for me; as Boaz, liking the woman as
   well as her inheritance, took them both, which his kinsman refused,
   Ruth iv. 9, 10; he would have the inheritance without the woman. They
   like Christ and his laws, as well as the benefits that he bringeth with
   him. He doth approve things upon good knowledge, and cometh to a
   well-settled resolution. Another defect in wicked men is because the
   judgment is superficial, and so comes to nothing. It is not full,
   clear, and ponderous; it is not a dictamen, a resolute decree, not
   ultimum dictamen, the last decree, all things considered and well
   weighed.

   [2.] God's grace. God doth never fully and spiritually convince the
   judgment, but he doth also work upon the will to accept, embrace, and
   prosecute those good things of which it is convinced. He teacheth and
   draweth; they are distinct works, but they go together; therefore the
   one is inferred out of the other. Drawn and taught of God, both are
   necessary; for as there is blindness and inadvertency in the mind, so
   obstinacy in the will, which is not to be cured by mere persuasion, but
   by a gracious quality infused, inclining the heart, which by the way
   freeth this doctrine from exception, as if all God's works were mere
   moral suasion. The will is renewed and changed, but so as God doth it,
   by working according to the order of nature.

   Use. By all means look after this divine illumination, whereby your
   judgment may be convinced of the truth and worth of spiritual things.
   It is not enough to have some general and floating notions about them,
   or slightly to hear of them, or talk of them; but they must be
   spiritually discerned and judged of; for if our judgments were
   thoroughly convinced, our pursuit of true happiness would be more
   earnest; you would see sin to be the greatest mischief, and grace the
   chiefest treasure, and accordingly act.

   God enlightening the soul doth--

   1. Take away carnal principles. Many men can talk well, but they are
   leavened with carnal principles; as (1.) That he may do as most do and
   yet be safe: Mat. vii. 23, Many will say in that day, Lord, Lord, have
   we not prophesied in thy name?' &c.; And then will I profess unto them,
   I never knew you; depart from me, ye that work iniquity;' Prov. xi. 31,
   Behold the righteous shall be recompensed upon the earth, much more the
   wicked and the sinner;' Exod. xxxii. &c. (2.) That he may go on in
   ungodliness, injustice, intemperance, because grace hath abounded in
   the gospel: Titus ii. 11, 12, For the grace of God that bringeth
   salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying
   ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and
   godlily in this present world;' and Luke i. 75, That we, being
   delivered out of the hands of our enemies, might serve him without
   fear, in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our
   life,' (3.) That he may spend his youth in pleasure, and safely put off
   repentance till age. But Eccles. xii. 1, we are bid to Remember our
   Creator in the days of our youth, while the evil days come not, nor the
   years draw nigh when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;' and
   Luke xii. 20, when the rich man said to his soul, Soul, thou hast much
   goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be
   merry;' God said unto him, Thou fool, this night shall thy soul be
   required of thee, then whose shall those things be which thou hast
   provided?' Heb. iii. 7, Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith, To-day, if
   ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts,' &c. Men think it is a
   folly to be singular and precise; that it was better when there was
   less preaching and less knowledge; that small sins are not to be stood
   upon. But God, enlightening the soul, maketh us to see the vanity and
   sinfulness of such thoughts.

   2. There is a bringing the understanding to attend and consider. There
   is much lieth upon it: Acts xvi. 14, The Lord opened the heart of
   Lydia, so that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul;'
   that is, weighed them in her heart.

SERMON XXXVIII.

   Yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart.--Ver. 34.

   I COME now to the last clause, I shall observe it with my whole heart.
   The point is--

   Doct. That it is not enough to keep God's law, but we must keep it with
   the whole heart.

   Here I shall show you--

   1. That God requireth the heart.

   2. The whole heart.

   First, God requireth the heart in his service. The heart is the
   Christian's sacrifice, the fountain of good and evil, and therefore
   should be mainly looked after. Without this--

   1. External profession is nothing. Most Christians have nothing for
   Christ but a good opinion or some outward profession. Judas was a
   disciple, but Satan entered into his heart,' Luke xxii. 3. Ananias
   joined himself to the people of God, but Satan filled his heart,' Acts
   v. 3. Simon Magus was baptized, but his heart was not right with God,'
   Acts viii. 22. Here is the great defect.

   2. External conformity is nothing worth. It is not enough that the life
   seem good, and many good actions be performed, unless the heart be
   purified; otherwise we do, with the Pharisees, wash the out side of the
   platter,' Mat. xxiii. 25, 26, when the inside is full of extortion and
   excess.' It is the heart God looketh after: 1 Sam. xvi. 7, For the Lord
   seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but
   the Lord looketh on the heart;' Prov. iv. 23, Keep thy heart with all
   diligence, for out of it are the issues of life.' Cast salt into the
   spring. As Jehu said to Jonadab, so doth God say to us: 2 Kings x. 15,
   Is thy heart right, as my heart is with thy heart?' We should answer,
   It is. Men are not for obsequious compliances if not with the heart, so
   neither is God. Though thou pray with the Pharisee, pay thy vows with
   the harlot, kiss Christ with Judas, offer sacrifice with Cain, fast
   with Jezebel, sell thine inheritance to give to the poor with Ananias
   and Sapphira, all is in vain without the heart, for it is the heart
   enliveneth all our duties.

   3. It is the heart wherein God dwelleth, not in the tongue, the brain,
   unless by common gifts; till he take possession of the heart all is as
   nothing: Eph. iii. 17, He dwelleth in our hearts by faith.' The bodies
   of believers are temples of the Holy Ghost; yet the heart, will, and
   affections of man are the chief place of his habitation, wherein he
   resideth as in his strong citadel, and from whence he commandeth other
   faculties and members; and without his presence there he cannot have
   any habitation in us. The tongue cannot receive him by speaking, nor
   the understanding by knowing, nor the hands by external working: Prov.
   iv. 23, Out of it are the issues of life.' It is the forge of spirits:
   He dwelleth not in temples made with hands,' Acts vii. 48; and Jer.
   xxiii. 24, Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the Lord.' He will
   dwell in thine heart and remain there, if thou wilt give thy heart to
   him.

   4. If Christ have it not, Satan will have it. The heart of man is not a
   waste; either God is there framing gracious operations, or the devil,
   who worketh in the children of disobedience,' Eph. ii. 2. Will you give
   them to God to be saved, or to the devil to be damned? Whose they are
   now they are for ever.

   5. If you love any, you give them the heart; and you are wont to wish
   that there were windows in your bodies that they might see the
   sincerity of your hearts towards them. Surely if you have cause to love
   any, you have much more cause to love God. No such friend as he, no
   such benefactor as he, if you consider what he hath done for us, what
   blessings he hath bestowed, internal, external, temporal, eternal. He
   hath given his Son, the great instance of love: John iii. 16, God so
   loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever
   believeth on him might not perish, but have everlasting life;' his
   gospel, that his love might be preached to us; his Spirit, that not
   only sounded in our ears, but is shed abroad in our hearts, Rom. v. 5;
   his Christ to save us, his word to enlighten us, his Spirit to guide
   and direct us till we come to heaven, where he will give himself to us,
   an eternal inheritance. Certainly, unless void of all sense and common
   ingenuity, thou wilt say, as the Psalmist, Ps. cxvi. 12, What shall I
   render unto the Lord for all his benefits towards me?' What indeed wilt
   thou render to him? Love will tell thee; but lest thou shouldst miss,
   God himself hath told thee: Prov. xxiii. 26, My son, give me thine
   heart.' There is no need to wish for windows in thy body: He searcheth
   the heart, and trieth the reins;' Ps. vii. 9, The righteous God trieth
   the hearts and reins;' and 1 Kings viii. 39, Thou knowest the hearts of
   all the children of men.' The whole world is to him as a sea of glass.
   He knoweth how much thou esteemest and honourest him. If thou givest
   him the whole world, and dost not give him thy heart, thou dishonourest
   him, and settest something else before him.

   6. This is, that all may give him. If God should require costly
   sacrifices, rivers of oil, thousands of rams, then none but the rich
   would serve him, and he would require nothing but what many hypocrites
   would give him. Then the poor would be ashamed and discouraged, not
   being able to comply with the command; yea, then God would not act like
   the true God, Who accepteth not the person of princes, nor regardeth
   the rich more than the poor, for they are all the work of his hands,'
   Job xxxiv. 19. Say not, Micah vi. 6-8, Wherewith shall I come before
   the Lord, and bow myself before the high God? Shall I come before him
   with burnt-offerings, with calves of a year old? Will the Lord be
   pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil?
   Shall I give my first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body
   for the sin of my soul?' But go to God and give him thy heart, this
   will make thy mite more acceptable than the great treasures of the
   wicked: Luke xxi. 1-4, And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting
   their gifts into the treasury; and he saw also a certain poor widow
   casting in thither two mites; and he said, Of a truth I say unto you,
   that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all; for all these
   have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God, but of her
   penury she hath cast in all the living that she had.' We read in pagan
   story of one that, when many rich scholars gave gifts to Socrates,
   every one according to his birth and fortunes, a poor young man came to
   him and said I have nothing worthy of thee to bestow upon thee, but
   that which I have I give, and that is myself; others that have given to
   thee have left more to themselves, but I have given all that I have,
   and have nothing left me; I give thee myself. The philosopher
   answered--Thou hast given me a gift indeed, and therefore it shall be
   my care to return thee to thyself better than I found thee. So come to
   God; he needeth us not, but it is for our benefit: we should give our
   hearts and selves to him. He knoweth how much it is for our advantage
   that he should have our hearts, to make them better, to sanctify and
   save them.

   Secondly, The whole heart. Here I shall show you--(1.) What it is to
   keep the law with the whole heart. (2.) Why we must keep the law with
   our whole heart.

   1. What it is to keep the law with the whole heart. It is taken legally
   or evangelically, as a man is bound, or as God will accept what is
   required in justice, or what is accepted in mercy.

   [1.] According to the rigour of the law. The law requireth exact
   conformity, without the least motion to the contrary, either in thought
   or desire, a full obedience to the law with all the powers of the whole
   man. This is in force still as to our rule, but not as to the condition
   of our acceptance with God. This, without any defect and imperfection,
   like man's love to God in innocency, since the fall is nowhere found
   but in Christ Jesus, who alone is harmless and undefiled, and will
   never thus be fulfilled by us till we come to heaven; for here all is
   but in part, but. then that which is in part shall be done away. Then
   will there be light without darkness, knowledge without ignorance,
   faith without unbelief, hope without despair, love without defect and
   mixture of carnal inclinations, all good motions without distraction.
   Here is folly and confusion; here flesh lusteth against the spirit' in
   the best, Gal. v. 17. They have a double principle, though not a double
   heart.

   [2.] In an evangelical sense, according to the moderation of the second
   covenant; and so God, out of his love and mercy in Christ Jesus,
   accepts of such a measure of love and obedience as answereth to the
   measure of sanctification received. When God sanctifieth a man he
   sanctifieth him as to all the parts and faculties of body and soul,
   enlighteneth the understanding with the knowledge of his will,
   inclineth the heart to obedience, circumciseth the affection, filleth
   us with the love of God himself and holy things. But being a voluntary
   agent, he doth not this as to perfection of degrees all at once, but
   successively, and by little and little. Therefore, as long as we are in
   the world there is somewhat of ignorance in the understanding,
   perversity in the will, fleshliness and impurity in the affections,
   flesh and spirit in every faculty, like water and wine in the same cup;
   but so as the gift of grace doth more and more prevail over the
   corruption of nature, light upon darkness, holiness upon sin, and
   heavenliness upon our inclinations to worldly vanities; as the sun upon
   the shadow of the night till it groweth into perfect day: Prov. iv. 18,
   The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and
   more unto the perfect day.' Therefore, when a man doth heartily apply
   himself to the things of God, and, acknowledging his defects, doth go
   on from faith to faith.' Rom. i. 17, from love to love, and from
   obedience to obedience, Heb. vi. 10, and doth study to bring his heart
   into a further conformity to God, not looking back to Sodom or turning
   back to Egypt, God accepteth of these desires and constant and uniform
   endeavours, and will spare us as a man spareth his only son that
   serveth him,' Mal. iii. 17--as a son, an only son, that is obsequious
   for the main, though he hath his failings and escapes. There is in them
   integrity, but not perfection; all parts of holiness, though not
   degrees: as in the body every muscle and vein and artery hath its use.
   Thus all Israel is said to seek the Lord with their whole desire: 2
   Chron. xv. 15, And all Judah rejoiced at the oath, for they had sworn
   with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire.' It is
   said of Asa, that he sought the Lord with his whole heart, yet the high
   places were not taken away.'

   2. Now, the reasons why we must keep the law with our whole heart are
   these following:--

   [1.] He that giveth a part only to God giveth nothing to God, for that
   part that is reserved will in time draw the whole after it. The devil
   keepeth an interest in us as long as any one lust remaineth
   unmortified; as Pharaoh stood hucking; he would fain have a pawn of
   their return; first their children, then their flocks and herds, must
   be left behind them. He knew this was the way to bring them back again.
   So Satan hath a pawn, and knoweth that all will fall to him at last:
   Hosea x. 2, Their heart is divided, now shall they be found faulty;'
   halting between God and idols. When men are not wholly and solely for
   God, but divided between him and other things, God will be jostled out
   at last. Grace is but a stranger, sin is a native, and therefore most
   likely to prevail, and by long use and custom is most strongly rooted.
   Herod did many things, but his Herodias drew him back into Satan's
   snare. A bird tied by the leg may flutter up and down and make some
   show of escape, but he is under command still. So may men have a
   conscience for God, and some affections for God, but the world and the
   flesh have the greater share in them. Therefore, though they do many
   things, yet still God hath no supreme interest in their souls; and
   therefore, when their darling lusts interpose, all God's interest in
   them signifieth nothing. As for instance, a man that is given to please
   the flesh, but in all other things findeth no difficulty, can worship,
   give alms, findeth no reluctancy to these duties, unless when they
   cross his living after the flesh, which in time swalloweth up his
   conscience and all his profession and practice. A man addicted to the
   world can deny his appetite, seem very serious in holy duties, but the
   world prevaileth, and in time maketh him weary of all other things.

   [2.] The whole man is God's by every kind of right and title; and
   therefore, when he requireth the whole heart, he doth but require that
   which is his own. God gave us the whole by creation, preserveth the
   whole, redeemeth the whole, and promiseth to glorify the whole. If we
   had been mangled in creation, we would have been troubled--if born
   without hands or feet. If God should turn us off to ourselves to keep
   that part to ourselves which we reserved from him, or if he should make
   such a division at death, take a part to heaven, or if Christ had
   bought part 1 Cor. vi. 20, Ye are bought with a price, therefore
   glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's if you
   have had any good work upon you, God hath sanctified the whole in a
   gospel sense, that is every part: 1 Thes. v. 23, And the very God of
   peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul
   and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus
   Christ;; not only conscience, but will and affections, appetite and
   body. And you have given all to him for his use: I am my beloved's;'
   not a part, but the whole. He could not endure Ananias, that kept back
   part of the price; all is his due. When the world, pleasure, ambition,
   pride, desire of riches, unchaste love, desire a part in us, we may
   remember we have no affections to dispose of without God's leave. It is
   all his, and it is sacrilege to rob or detain any part from God. Shall
   I alienate that which is God's, to satisfy the world, the flesh, and
   the devil? It is his by creation, redemption, donation. When our flesh,
   or the world, or Satan, detain any part, this is, with Reuben, to go up
   unto our father's bed.

   Use 1. First, to reprove those that do not give God the heart in their
   service; secondly, not the whole heart.

   1. Not the heart, but content themselves with outward profession: Jer.
   xii. 2, Thou art near in their mouth, but far from their reins.' God is
   often in their speech, but they have no hearty affection. Never was
   there an age higher in notions and colder in practice of Christianity.
   The heart is all; it is the terminus actionum ad intra, et fons
   actionum ad extra. It is the bound of those actions that look inward;
   the senses report to the phantasy, that to the mind, and the mind
   counsels the heart: If wisdom enter the heart,' Prov. ii. 10. It is the
   well-spring of those actions that look outward to the life: Prov. iv.
   23, Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of
   life;' Mat. xv. 19, and Prov. iv. 4, Let thy heart retain my words;
   keep my commandments and live;' then other things will follow.

   2. It reproves those that do not give God the whole heart, for he
   requireth that, and surely all is too little for so great and so good a
   master. God will have the heart, so that no part of it be left to
   others, or for ourselves to dispose of as we will: the true mother
   would not have the child divided, 1 Kings iii. 26. God will have all or
   nothing, he will not part stakes with Satan; but Satan, if he cannot
   have all, will be content with a part. But who are they that do not
   give God the whole heart?

   [1.] Those that are for God in their consciences but not in their
   affections. Conscience many times taketh God's part. Their affections
   are for the world, but their consciences are for God, as convinced men
   that do some outward work commanded in the law, but they have no love
   to the work. This will not serve the turn, for whatever is done by
   constraint, or the mere compulsion of a natural conscience, can never
   hold long. Nature will return to its bias again, however men force
   themselves for a while to comply with something which God hath
   commanded. They do not take up his ways by choice, but upon compulsion
   and the urgings of conscience, which they no way liked.

   [2.] Those that have their affections divided between God and the
   world, halting between two, they have some affection to spiritual
   things, the favour of God and holiness as the only means to make them
   happy, but the world and their lusts have the greater share. They are
   troubled a little, would have the favour of God, but upon their own
   conditions. The prevailing part of the soul bendeth them to carnal
   interests; as the person that was told that he must take up the cross
   and follow Christ, he is offended, Mat xi. 21; the young man turned
   away discontented when he heard the terms, Mat. xix. 21, 22. They like
   God's offers, but not his conditions to come up fully to his mind. They
   are loath to enter into gospel bonds. These do not entirely give up
   themselves to God; they have but an affection in part to the comforts
   of the gospel, but not to the duties of the gospel.

   [3.] Those that will do many things, but stick at one part of their
   duty to God. Men may suffer much for God, sacrifice some of their
   weaker lusts, but whilst any one sin remaineth unmodified there is
   possession kept for Satan; as Saul destroyed the Amalekites, but kept
   the fattest of the cattle, and spared Agag. Herod will not part with
   his Herodias: Ps. xviii. 23, David saith, I was also upright before
   him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.' Either some lust of the
   flesh, or of the eyes, or pride remaineth. There are some tender parts
   of the soul which are as the right hand and the right eye, men are
   loath to have them touched. They do not unfeignedly comply with God's
   whole will.

   Use 2. To press you to give up the whole heart to God in a course of
   obedience.

   Let us believe in God with all the heart: Acts viii. 32, If thou
   believest with all thy heart, thou mayest,' &c.; and Prov. iii. 5,
   Trust in the Lord with all thy heart.' This is the main thing of
   Christianity, when there is not only a naked assent, but when we
   embrace Christ with the heart, and there is a full and free consent to
   take him to all the uses for which God hath appointed him. So for love:
   Deut. vi. 5, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with
   all thy soul, and with all thy might.' When we delight in God, and find
   full complacency in him as our all-sufficient portion, without
   reserving any part of our hearts for other things. So for obedience: 1
   Chron. xxviii. 9, And thou, Solomon, my son, know thou the God of thy
   father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; for
   the Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations
   of the thoughts.' But now, how shall we know that we give God all the
   heart in an evangelical sense?

   Ans. 1. When our purpose is to cleave to God alone, and to serve him
   with an entire obedience both of the inward and outward man, purely and
   sincerely, without hypocrisy: Ps. li. 6, Behold thou desirest truth in
   the inward parts, and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know
   wisdom;' and Phil. iii. 3, For we are the circumcision, which worship
   God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence
   in the flesh.'

   Ans. 2. When we do what we can by all good means to maintain our
   purpose, and are watchful and diligent, and serious in this purpose: 2
   Kings x. 31, Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord God of
   Israel with all his heart, for he departed not from the sins of
   Jeroboam which made Israel to sin.' See the contrary in Paul: Acts
   xxiv. 16, And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience
   void of offence towards God and towards men.' They bent all their
   studies and fervency of their spirit this way, with all earnestness of
   endeavour to come up to God's law.

   Ans. 3. When we search out our defects, and bewail them with a kindly
   remorse, Rom. ii. 29; when we run by faith to Christ Jesus, and sue out
   our pardon and peace: 1 John ii. 1, My little children, these things
   write I unto you that ye sin not; and if any man sin, we have an
   advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.'
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON XXXIX.

   Make me to go in the path of thy commandments, for therein do I
   delight.--Ver. 35.

   DAVID in the former verses had begged for light, and now for strength
   to walk according to this light. We need not only light to know our
   way, but a heart to walk in it. Direction is necessary because of the
   blindness of our minds, and the effectual impulsions of grace are
   necessary because of the weakness of our hearts. It will not answer our
   duty to have a naked notion of truths, unless we embrace and pursue
   them. So accordingly we need a double assistance from God; the mind
   must be enlightened, the will moved and inclined. The work of a
   Christian lies not in depth of speculation, but in the height of
   practice. The excellency of divine grace consisteth in this, that God
   doth first teach what is to be done, and then make us to do what is
   taught, Make me to go in the path,' &c.

   Here you have David's prayer, and an argument to enforce it.

   1. His prayer, make me to go in the path of thy commandments.

   2. His argument, for therein do I delight.

   The argument is taken from his delight in the ways of God. This
   argument may be looked upon as the reason of making the request, or the
   reason of granting the request.

   1. As the reason of asking. Those whose hearts are set upon obedience,
   they will be earnest for grace to perform it acceptably. Now, saith
   David, I would not be denied this request, for this is all my delight,
   to do thy will.

   2. As the reason of granting. And there he may be supposed to lay forth
   his necessity and his hope. His necessity; though God had done much for
   him, yet he needed more still. God had given him scire, knowledge to
   know his duty; velle, to delight; now he begs perficere, to practise,
   to bring it to an issue. Though he had grace in some measure, yet he
   still needed an increase; God must work in us both to will and to do,
   Phil. ii. 12. Sometimes God gives one where he gives not the other:
   Rom. vii. 18, To will is present with me; but how to perform that which
   is good, I find not.' Or else you may sup pose him here to lay forth
   his hope. The granting of one grace makes way for another; for God will
   perfect what he hath begun, and where he hath given a disposition to
   delight in his ways, he will give grace to walk in his precepts: John
   i. 16, charin anti charitos, Grace upon grace,' or grace after grace;'
   his giving grace to them is an argument why he will give more grace to
   them. Two things will be here discussed:--

   [1.] The necessity of the efficacious assistance of grace, that we may
   walk worthy of God in all well-pleasing.

   [2.] How acceptable a frame of heart it is when we are once brought to
   delight in the ways of God.

   Doct. 1. For the first, that God from first to last doth make us to go
   in the path of his commandments.

   David was a renewed man, a man that had gotten his heart into a good
   frame; for he owneth his delight in the paths of God's commandments,
   yet he begs for new strength and quickening, Make me to go;' Lead or
   walk me'--Sept.

   First, That at first conversion God maketh us go in the path of his
   commandments; that is clear by scripture; for it is said, Eph. ii. 10,
   that we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works,
   which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.' When we
   are renewed, we are as it were created over again; there is a power
   given us that we had not before to do this work. Clearly the apostle
   doth not speak there of the first creation--the end of our first
   creation was to serve God--but he speaks of supernatural renovation;
   for he saith, We are created in Christ Jesus.' There was a twofold
   creation at first: Ex nihilo and ex inhabili materia; either that which
   God created out of nothing, or if out of pre-existent matter, yet such
   as was wholly unfit and indisposed for those things that were to be
   made of it. Now, this latter suits with us: We are created in Christ
   Jesus to good works;' that is, we were altogether indisposed before to
   that which is good. We have our natural powers, but they are wholly
   viciously inclined till the Lord worketh on us, and infuseth a
   principle of new life. Till then we cannot do anything that is
   spiritually good. But when the Lord createth us anew, he furnisheth us
   with an inward power and ability to do good. What David prays for, Make
   me to go in the way of thy commandments.' God promiseth, Ezek. xxxvi.
   27, I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my
   statutes.' God puts his spirit, a new principle of grace. When the
   gospel is proposed to a man, his will must be determined by something,
   either by an object or a quality, not by the proposal merely of the
   object without; for the scripture shows there must be some work upon
   the heart, some divine quality infused within to incline and bend us to
   what is good. Well, then, first there must be an infusion of the
   principles of grace. In sinning, there the mischief began with an act.
   Adam sinned, and that infected his nature. But in grace the method is
   contrary; the principle must be before the action, God first
   sanctifieth our natures, and then we act holily; and this difference
   there is between acquired and infused habits: acquired habits follow
   action, for frequent acts beget a habit, as often swimming makes us
   expert in swimming, and much writing expert in writing; but gracious
   habits are infused, and so precede the act, as a wheel runs round, not
   to make itself round, but because it is round. Indeed there is a
   further radiation of grace by frequent acts as the means which God
   blesseth. Now, by this first work of grace we have three advantages:--

   1. An inclination and tendency towards what is good. As all natures
   imply a propensity to those things which agree to such a nature, as
   sparks fly upward, and a stone moves downward--it is their natural
   propensity--so in the new nature there is a new bent and tendency of
   heart, which is to live unto God, Gal. ii. 19; there is an inclination
   towards God and holy things; and therefore the apostle presseth them by
   virtue of this grace received to act according to the tendency of the
   new nature: Rom. vi. 13, Yield yourselves unto God, as those that are
   alive from the dead;' that is his argument. As soon as the life of
   grace is infused, the soul bends towards God.

   2. A preparation of heart for holy actions. There is a principle that
   will carry them to it. These vessels are fitted and prepared for their
   master's use,' and are prepared unto every good work,' 2 Tim. ii. 21;
   they are fitted and rigged for all holy actions and employments: Eph.
   ii. 10, Created unto good works, which God hath prepared that we should
   walk in them.' He hath prepared them for us, and us to them. There is a
   suitableness in the new nature to what God requireth. As every creature
   is furnished with power and faculties suitable to those operations that
   belong to them, so when the Lord infuseth the principles of grace, and
   works upon the heart, we are suited to every good work, so that we need
   not new faculties, but new operations of grace to excite and move us. A
   ship that is rigged and fitted with sails ready for a voyage needs a
   pilot to guide and steer it; so we need influences of grace. Therefore,
   when the Spirit is shed upon us after wards, it is in another manner
   than upon the unregenerate. The unregenerate are objects of grace, but
   the renewed are instruments of grace; he works upon the one, but he
   works by the other.

   3. There is a power and an ability to do good works when we are
   renewed; if otherwise, one of God's most precious gifts would be in
   vain, if we were altogether without strength. That is the description
   of carnal nature, Rom. v. 6, We were without strength;' therefore there
   is a power which must be improved, not rested in: Gal. v. 25, If ye
   live in the spirit, walk in the spirit.' There is an operation that
   accompanieth every life, and if there be a life of grace there will be
   a walking; and Col. ii. 6, As ye have received Christ, so walk in him.'
   Grace received must not lie idle, but be put forth into act. Thus God
   creates and infuseth such divine qualities as may give us a tendency
   and preparation of heart, and strength to do that which may be pleasing
   to him.

   Secondly, He vouchsafeth his quickening, actuating, assisting grace,
   for the improving these principles infused, that their operations may
   be carried forth with more success: Ezek. xxxvi. 27, I will put my
   spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes.' God gives not
   only life, but the constant motion of that life. Natural things do not
   act without his daily providential influence; and therefore it is said,
   Prov. xx. 12, God gives the hearing ear and the seeing eye;' not only
   doth give the eye and ear, the faculty, but the act of hearing and the
   act of seeing; he concurs to that: and therefore God concurs by his
   actual assistance, sometimes in a more liberal and plentiful manner, by
   the freer aids and assistances of his grace, and sometimes more
   sparingly, according to his own pleasure. He doth not only give us the
   habits of grace, He worketh all our works for us,' Isa. xxvi. 12.

   Now this actual help is necessary--

   1. Partly to direct us: Ps. lxxiii. 24, Thou shalt guide me with thy
   counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.' We need not only a
   principle within and a rule without, but need also a guide. Though we
   have grace in our hearts, though we have the law of God to direct us,
   yet we need also a guide upon all occasions. The rule is the scripture,
   and the guide is the Spirit of God.

   2. Partly to quicken and excite us by effectual motions. The heart of
   man is very changeable, and it is like the eye, easily discomposed and
   put out of frame. Deadness creeps upon us, and we drive on heavily in
   the work of God: Ps. cxix. 37, Quicken thou me in thy way.' God doth
   renew the vigour of the life of grace upon all occasions.

   3. Partly to corroborate and strengthen that which we have received,
   and make it increase and grow in the soul, and more firmly rooted
   there, Eph. iii. 16. The apostle prays that God would strengthen you
   with might by his Spirit in the inner man.' The inward man, the frame
   of grace that we have received, needs to be strengthened, increased,
   and be more deeply rooted in the soul. So 1 Peter v. 10, The God of all
   grace make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.' Many words
   are used, to show how God is interested in maintaining and keeping
   afoot the grace he hath planted in the soul.

   4. Partly in protecting and defending them against the incursion* and
   assaults of the devil. The regenerate are not only escaped out of his
   clutches, but appointed to be his judges, which an envious and proud
   spirit cannot endure; therefore he maligneth, assaulteth, and besiegeth
   them with temptations daily; therefore Christ prays, John xvii. 11,
   Keep through thy own name those whom thou hast given me.' When a city
   is besieged, fresh supplies are sent in; they are not kept to their
   standing provision: so it is not the ordinary power of God that doth
   preserve and keep us from danger; there is new relief and fresh
   strength: We are kept by the power of God through faith unto
   salvation,' 2 Peter i. 5. Now we experience the help we have from God,
   partly by the change and frame of our heart, when we are acted by him,
   and when we are not. When God by the impulsions of his grace doth
   quicken and awaken our hearts, we are carried on with a great deal of
   earnestness and strength; but at other times we seem to be much bound,
   and have not those breathings from the Spirit of God to fill our sails,
   and carry us on with the same life and strength. Yea, in the same duty
   how is a Christian up and down! carried out sometimes with a great deal
   of zeal and warmth; but if God withdraw that assistance before the duty
   be over, how do the affections flag! So that we are like the wards of a
   lock, kept up while the key is turned, but fall again when the key is
   turned the other way. While the work of grace is powerful, we are kept
   in a warm and heavenly plight. Thus as to duties we need spiritual
   relief.

   Likewise in temptations, when we are ready to fall into such a sin.
   with great proneness of heart, and the Lord quickens and excites us by
   his grace. It is often with a Christian as with David: Ps. lxxiii. 2,
   My feet were almost gone; my steps had well-nigh slipt;' even carried
   away by the violence of Satan, and importunate motions of our own
   lusts; then the Lord gives grace to help in a time of need,' Heb. iv.
   16. In the original it is no more but this, Seasonable relief God
   vouchsafeth.

   Object. Ay! but are we to do nothing when we are indisposed?

   This case is often traversed in this psalm.

   1. The precept of God falls upon us as reasonable creatures, and doth
   not consider whether we are disposed or indisposed; and God's influence
   is not our rule, but our help. We are to stir up ourselves; the Lord
   complains, Isa. lxiv. 7, There is none that stirreth up himself to take
   hold of me;' and Timothy is bid to stir up the gift of God which is in
   him,' 2 Tim. i. 6. God's assistance will be best expected in a way of
   doing; up and be doing, and the Lord will be with thee. When we stir up
   ourselves, and set ourselves to the work in the conscience of our duty,
   we can better expect God's help and assistance.

   2. In great distempers there may be some pause. Elisha would not
   prophesy when he was under a passion of anger; therefore he calls for a
   minstrel to sing a psalm, 2 Kings iii. 13-15, and as he played upon an
   instrument, the Spirit of the Lord came upon him. He was under a
   passion, offended with the king of Israel, therefore he would not
   prophesy until his spirit was composed. Certainly we are not to run
   headlong upon duties in the midst of these distempers. Sailing is more
   safely delayed in tune of an extreme storm. When the heart is put into
   some great disorder, in a great storm of spirit, the distemper should
   first be mourned for and prayed against.

   The reasons why from first to last he must make us go in the way of his
   commandments.

   1. God keeps this power in his own hands, that his grace might be all
   in all, and it is the glory of his actions always to set the crown upon
   grace's head. Not only those permanent and fixed habits which
   constitute the new man, but those daily supplies, without which the
   motions and operations of the spiritual life would be at a stand, are
   of grace. When the Lord reckons with his servants about the improvement
   of their talents, he doth not say, My industry, but, Lord, thy pound,'
   Luke xix. 18; he puts all the honour upon grace. So 1 Cor. xvi. 10, Not
   I, but the grace of God;' so Gal. ii. 20, I live, yet not I, but Christ
   liveth in me.' So that still they are giving the glory to grace. Acts
   are more perfect than habits; therefore if we had only the power from
   God, and acts from ourselves, we should not give all to God. That acts
   are more perfect than the power is clear; it is more perfect to
   understand than to have a power to understand; power is in order to the
   act, and the end is more noble than the means.

   2. This is a very great encouragement to us to set upon the exercise of
   grace in the midst of weaknesses, and several difficulties and
   temptations wherewith we are encompassed. Because God will enable and
   assist us, he will not leave us to our standing strength, but he
   concurs: Phil. ii. 12, 13, Work out your salvation with fear and
   trembling.' Why? For it is God that worketh in you to will and to do of
   his good pleasure.' When God will concur to the will and to the deed,
   to both, when we have wind and tide, he is very lazy that will not take
   his advantage and ply the oar then. And the apostle was not
   disheartened with the several conditions he was to run through in his
   passage to heaven: Phil. iv. 13, I can do all things through Christ
   that strengthened me.' When we have such an able second--God is at our
   right hand,' Ps. xvi. 8--we need not be so dismayed with temptations
   and difficulties we meet with in the progress of our duty; though we
   have many lets and hindrances, yet God will cause us to walk in his
   ways.

   3. This keeps us humble and lowly in our own conceit, and that is very
   necessary for us; for pride is that sin which cleaves to us all our
   life, and is called pride of life,' and lasts as long as life lasts.
   How doth this keep us humble and lowly? Partly thus: because we have
   all by gift; What hast thou that thou hast not received?' 1 Cor. iv. 7.
   All the strength that we have is but borrowed; and who will be proud
   that is more in debt than others? We would laugh at a groom that is
   proud of his master's horse. All grace comes from God. Shall we usurp
   the honour due to God? And partly because we have but from hand to
   mouth. Though we have all from God, yet we should soon grow proud if
   God did not diet us, and give out renewed evidences of his love and
   care over us by degrees, some now, some then, by fresh influences and
   acts of grace. Look, as David prays, Ps. lix. 11, of his outward
   enemies, Destroy them not, O Lord, lest my people forget: scatter them
   by thy power, and bring them down.' Oh! if all enemies were destroyed
   at once, the people would forget thee, the deliverance would be past,
   antiquated, and out of date, and would not be so freshly thought of,
   nor produce such warm affections in the hearts of his people. So it is
   true in the spiritual world, God doth not destroy all at once, but
   brings down our spiritual enemies, that we may acknowledge whence we
   have it. And partly because this is a means to make us sensible of the
   mutability of our nature; for when all depends upon God, his coming and
   going, it will make us see what poor creatures we are of ourselves.
   When he comes, we are able to do something; when he goes, what poor
   creatures are we! 2 Chron. xxxii. 31, God left him, to try him, that he
   might know all that was in his heart.' When we are renewed yet are not
   fully recovered, there is a great deal of tang and taste of the old
   leaven, and if God leave us we shall soon sin; whereas if we were
   carried on with an even constant tenor of grace that is in our own
   keeping, we should be proud.

   4. It endears the heart to God, and God to the heart, by acts of friend
   ship and familiarity, as it extracts from us acts of prayer and
   dependence, and as we receive new supplies and daily influences of
   grace from him. God is more endeared to the soul by his multiplied free
   gifts. Look, as at every lifting up of the foot there are new
   influences of life go to that stirring and motion, so all in the
   spiritual life are his acts of grace. If so much rain fell in one day
   as would suffice for seven years, there would be no notice taken of
   God's acts of providence; God would not have such witness to keep up
   his memory to the sons of men. So here; if we had all graces in our
   souls, and needed not new excitement, but he dispensed all at once, God
   and we should grow strangers. When the prodigal has his portion in his
   own hands, he leaves his father: and therefore there must be continual
   acts of kindness to maintain a holy friendship between God and us.

   Use 1. Look after renewing grace; see whether there be a principle of
   life in you or no, whether you be his workmanship in Christ Jesus.
   Better never be his creature if not a new creature; a dog is in a
   better condition. You can do nothing in the spiritual life until there
   be a principle; in vain to expect new operation before a new creation
   be passed upon you. The stream cannot be maintained without the spring.

   2. Let us^pray for strength upon all occasions, and beg the renewings
   of God's efficacious grace, that we may avoid sin, and be ready to
   every good work. Alas! there are many discouragements from without, and
   sundry baits which tickle the flesh, and would seduce us from our duty.
   Unless the Lord stand by us, and protect and strengthen us within,
   deadness will soon creep upon us, and our heart run out of order. Look
   after new influences of grace; this will make you ready to every good
   work; not only the remote preparation, but the furniture of the
   faculties and abilities: Lo I come to do thy will;' and this will make
   you fruitful, otherwise you will be as dry trees in God's garden; and
   this will make you lively and constant, not off and on, but fixed with
   God.

   3. If all depends upon God, then let us not by any negligence of ours,
   or by presumptuous sins, provoke God to withdraw his assisting grace
   from us. This is the apostle's meaning when he saith, Phil. ii. 12, 13,
   Work out your salvation with fear and trembling,' &c. Oh! take heed; go
   about the business of religion with holy caution and jealousy over
   yourselves, and fear the Lord's displeasure, for all depends upon him.
   Dependence among men begets observance; where men have their meat,
   drink, clothing, they will be careful to please there. So work out your
   salvation, &c., for it is God that worketh in you,' &c. You have all
   from God; the business of the spiritual life will be interrupted and be
   at a stand if God withhold his grace. Every sin weakens that you have
   already, and provokes God to withhold his hand that he will not give
   more. That which is the greatest ground of comfort and confidence is
   always the greatest ground of fear and trembling. It is a ground of
   great comfort and confidence in the spiritual life that he will help us
   in every action of ours; and it is a ground also of the greatest fear
   and trembling, that we should be careful not to offend him upon whom
   all depends.

   The second point:--

   Doct. 2. That they which delight in God's commandments will beg his
   gracious assistance, and are most likely to speed in their requests.

   I make it to be both the reason of asking and the reason of granting.

   First, The reason of asking.

   1. What is this delight in God?' What is necessary to it?

   2. What are the fruits and effects of it? First, What is necessary to
   it?

   1. A new nature, for what we do naturally we do with complacency and
   delight. That which is forced and done against the grain and bent of
   our hearts can never be delightful, and therefore there needs a
   principle of grace within: Ps. cxii. 1, Blessed is the man that feareth
   the Lord, that delighteth greatly in his commandments.' Where there is
   true grace and the fear of God, there we will delight greatly. So Rom.
   vii. 22, I delight in the law of God after the inward man.' Where there
   is an inner man, a frame of grace in the heart, that will bring
   delight. See the character of a blessed man: Ps. i. 2, His delight is
   in the law of the Lord.' Quite contrary to the hypocrite. He may act
   from compulsions and urgings of conscience, from legal bondage: it may
   be a sin-offering, but it is not a thank-offering; he cannot do it with
   that delight and complacency that God hath required. Job. xxvii. 10 it
   is said, Will he always call upon God? will he delight himself in the
   Almighty?' In his pang, in his distress, when his conscience pincheth
   him sore, he will be calling upon God. Ay! but hath he any delight in
   God? He wants sincere grace. Some time he may come with his flocks and
   herds to seek the Lord: Hosea v. 6, And cry, Arise, Lord save us,' Jer.
   ii. 27. Some unwilling services he may perform upon foreign reasons,
   from constraint, from his affliction and anguish of soul; but these
   things are never done with delight; there needs then a principle of
   grace.

   2. Peace of conscience, or a sense of our reconciliation with God, is
   very necessary to this delight in the ways of God: Rom. v. 11, We joy
   in God as those that have received the atonement.' Christ hath made the
   atonement. Now, when we receive the atonement, that is, are possessed
   of it, and look upon ourselves as involved in the reconciliation Christ
   hath made for us, then we joy in God. The joy of a good conscience is
   necessary to this delight in the ways of God.

   3. A good frame of heart must be kept up, for the joy of a Christian
   may be impaired by his own folly and prevalency of carnal distempers.
   There is dullness and a damp that is apt to creep upon us; either by
   carnal pleasure, or worldly lusts and cares, we may abate of our cheer
   fulness. Christ tells us, Luke xxi. 34, that both of them overcharge
   the heart. Or some presumptuous sin lately committed, when the weight
   of it lieth upon the conscience, we lose this free spirit: Ps. li. 12,
   Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and uphold me with thy free
   spirit;' our delight is quenched, and we lose that free spirit which
   otherwise we should have. And therefore we must watch against carnal
   distempers, and also presumptuous sins, that we may not lose our
   liberty and our comfortableness in God's service; for when a Christian
   hath a good frame of heart, he is filled as with gladness, and the joy
   of the Lord is as oil to the wheels, and it strengthens his affections,
   and he is carried on with a great deal of cheerfulness.

   4. There is needful, too, some experience; for besides the joy of God,
   there is the inward pleasure of a good conversation. The ways of God
   are all ways of pleasantness to them that walk in them, Prov. iii. 17.
   They which will make trial will find Christ's yoke easy; yea, they will
   find a sweetness in God's ways beyond whatever they could think or
   expect. Some experience of the pleasantness in the paths of wisdom
   breeds great delight.

   Secondly, What are the effects of this delight?

   1. A cheerfulness of spirit, a ready obedience: Ps. xl. 8, I delight to
   do thy will, my God.' They find more solid joy in living holily than in
   all the pleasure of sin and vanity of the world; therefore they
   cheerfully practise that which God requireth of them.

   2. They are full of joy and gladness in all their approaches to God:
   Ps. cxxii. 1, I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the
   house of the Lord.' Oh! then they can go to God, and draw off from the
   distractions of this world, that they may unbosom themselves, that they
   may be in God's company, either in public or private.

   3. They are weaned from earthly pleasures. When they have tasted of
   this hidden manna, the garlic and onions of Egypt lose their relish;
   and they find more sweetness, more rejoicing, in the testimony of their
   consciences, than ever they could find in the world. It is their meat
   and drink to do the will of God, to be just, holy, temperate, strict,
   to walk closely with God; here is their pleasure and delight of their
   souls: John iv. 34, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and
   to finish his work.'

   Now the reasons of this. They which have their hearts set upon holiness
   must have delight. A man whose heart is set upon earthly things will
   come and howl for corn, wine, and oil, outward enjoyments, Hosea vii.;
   and a man that makes a loose profession of religion would fain be
   feasted with comforts, and eased of the smart of his conscience; he
   loves to hear of the privilege part of Christianity; but they come not
   to God with a true heart, whatever profession they make, Heb. x. 27.
   They embrace Christ as Judas kissed him, to betray him, or as Joab
   embraced Amasa, that he might smite him under the fifth rib; so these
   are so earnest for pardon of sin, and the privilege part of
   Christianity, but mind not the higher part, which is sanctification.
   But now a man that is fallen in love with holiness, and whose heart is
   sincerely bent to God, desires grace to incline his heart to God and
   the ways of God, and keep exactly with him.

   Secondly, As this is the reason of asking, so likewise of granting,
   Make me to go in the path of thy commandments, for therein do I
   delight.' Take four considerations for this:--

   1. God will add grace to grace. When God hath given the will, he will
   give the deed, further grace, to add new influences to his own seed. We
   tell God of the dispositions that are in our hearts, that he may
   perfect them, and ripen his own seed: John i. 16, Of his fulness have
   all we received, and grace for grace;' grace upon grace, or grace after
   grace. God's giving one grace is an argument why he will give more
   grace.

   2. God looks after affection rather than action. Sometimes he takes the
   will for the deed, but never the deed for the will. Where there is a
   will and delight in his ways, that is it which is most acceptable to
   him. Look, as to love sin is more than to commit it--a man may commit
   it out of frailty, but he that loves and cherisheth it is exceeding
   bad--so where there is delight in the ways of God, and the soul is
   gained to them. This is that God looks after, the affection.

   3. Of all our affections delight and complacency is most acceptable.
   The promise is made to such: Ps. xxxvii. 4, Delight thyself in the
   Lord, and he will give thee the desire of thine heart.' It is a slander
   that the hypocrite brings upon God: Job xxxiv. 9, He hath said, It
   profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.' There
   is a great deal of profit, for God looks to the affection, and of all
   affections to the delight.

   4. When this delight is not set upon privileges, but upon grace and
   obedience, this is more acceptable to God, I delight in thy ways.' When
   we set upon obedience it is a sign we mind God's interest more than our
   own comfort; that is our own interest, but subjection to God and
   holiness, that is for his glory; therefore, when the heart is set upon
   obedience, then he will give in supplies of grace.

   Use. Oh! that we could say that we take joy and pleasure in the way of
   his commandments: Thou hast given me delight in thy ways, give me
   strength to keep them. To corrupt nature the ways of God are
   burdensome, but to his children the commandments of God are not
   grievous;' we shall not then want influences of grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON XL.

   Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness--Ver.
   36.

   IN the former verses David had asked understanding and direction to
   know the Lord's will; now he asketh an inclination of heart to do the
   Lord's will,

   The understanding needs not only to be enlightened, but the will to be
   moved and changed.

   Man's heart is of its own accord averse from God and holiness, even
   then when the wit is most refined, and the understanding is stocked and
   stored with high notions about it; therefore, David doth not only say,
   Give me understanding,' but Incline my heart.' We can be worldly of
   ourselves, but we cannot be holy and heavenly of ourselves; that must
   be asked of him who is the father of lights, from whom cometh down
   every good and perfect gift.' They that plead for the power of nature
   shut out the use of prayer; for if by nature we could determine
   ourselves to that which is good, there would be no need of grace; and
   if there be no need of grace, there is no use of prayer. But Austin
   hath said well, Natura vera confessione, non falsa defensione, opus
   habet--we need rather to confess our weakness than defend our strength.
   Thus doth David, and so will every broken-hearted Christian that hath
   had an experience of the inclinations of his own soul; he will come to
   God and say, Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to
   covetousness.'

   In which words there is something implied and something expressed. That
   which is implied is a confession; that which is expressed is a
   supplication. That which he confesseth is the natural inclination of
   his heart to worldly things, and by consequence to all evil; for every
   sin receiveth life and strength from worldly inclinations. That which
   he begs is, that the full bent and consent of his heart may carry him
   out to God's testimonies. Or, briefly, here is--

   1. The thing asked, incline my heart.

   2. The object of this inclination, expressed positively, unto thy
   testimonies; negatively, and not unto covetousness.

   Here is the object to which, and the object from which. To which,
   Incline me to thy testimonies,' and suffer me not to decline to worldly
   objects, expressed here by the lust which is most conversant about
   them, covetousness.'

   Let me explain them more fully. Incline my heart;' the word implies--

   1. Our natural obstinacy and disobedience to God's law; for if the
   heart of man were naturally prone, and of its own accord ready to
   obedience, it were in vain said to God, Incline my heart.' Ay! but till
   God bend us the other way we lie averse and awkward from his
   commandments. As God is said here to incline us, so, John vi. 44, he is
   said to draw us. There is a corrupt will which hangs back, and desires
   anything rather than that which is right. We need to be drawn and bent
   again like a crooked stick the other way.

   2. It implies God's gracious and powerful act upon the soul, where by
   the heart is fixed and set to that which is good, when there is a
   proneness another way; this is the fruit of effectual grace.

   Now let us see when the heart is inclined, and how this is brought to
   pass.

   1. When is the heart said to be inclined? I answer--When the habitual
   bent of our affections is more to holiness than to worldly things; for
   the power of sin stands in the love of it, and so doth our aptness for
   grace in the love of it, or in the bent of the will, the strength of
   desire and affections by which we are carried out after it. Amor meus
   est pondus meum, eo feror quocunque feror--our love is the weight that
   is upon our souls. Nothing can be done well that is not done sweetly.
   Then are we inclined, when our affections have a proneness and
   propension to that which is good. Now these affections must be more to
   holiness than to worldly things; for by the prevalency is grace
   determined, if the preponderating part of the soul be for God. It is
   not an equal poise; we are always standing between two parties. There
   is God and the world; a sensitive good drawing one way, and there is a
   spiritual good draws us another way. Now grace prevails when the scales
   are cast on grace's side. I say it is the habitual bent, not for a
   pang; the heart must be set to seek the Lord: 1 Chron. xxii. 19, Now
   set your heart and your soul to seek the Lord your God;' and the course
   of our endeavours, the strength and stream of our souls runs out this
   way; then is the heart said to be inclined to God's testimonies.

   2. How is it brought to pass? or how doth God thus reduce and frame our
   hearts to the obedience of his will? There are two ways which God
   useth--by the word and by his Spirit, by persuasion and by power; they
   shall be taught of God,' and they are drawn of God:' John vi. 44, The
   Lord will allure Japheth;' so he works by persuasion, Gen. ix. 27; and
   then by power, Ezek. xxxvi. 26, 27, I will cause you to walk in my
   ways,' &c. God tempers an irresistible strength and sweetness together,
   fortiler pro te, Domine, suaviter pro me. He worketh as God, therefore
   he works strongly and invincibly; but he persuades men as men,
   therefore he propounds reasons and arguments, goes to work by way of
   persuasion; strongly according to his own nature, sweetly according to
   man's, by persuasions accompanied by the secret efficacy of his own
   grace. First he gives weighty reasons, he casts in weight after weight
   till the scales be turned; then he makes all effectual by his Spirit.
   Morally he works, because God will preserve man's nature and the
   principles thereof; therefore he doth not work by violence, but by a
   sweet inclination, alluring and speaking comfortably unto us: Hosea xi.
   4, I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love.' God knows all
   the wards of man's heart, and what kind of keys will fit the lock;
   therefore he suits such arguments as may work upon us, and take us in
   our month, and then really and prevailingly, so as the effect may
   follow. Surely God hath more hand in good than Satan hath in evil;
   otherwise man were as praise worthy for doing good as reprovable for
   doing evil. God inclines the heart to that which is good, and persuades
   it by his grace. God knows how to alter the course of our affections by
   his secret power, therefore doth not only lead, but draw, works
   intimately upon the heart.

   Unto thy testimonies, so the word of God is called, for it testifieth
   of his will. There we have a clear proof and testimony how God stands
   affected to every man, what kind of affection God hath to him.

   And not to covetousness. Mark the phrase incline,' &c. Doth God incline
   us to covetousness? No; but he permits us to the inclinations of our
   own hearts, justly denying his grace to those that do offend him, and
   upon the suspension of his grace nature is left to her own sway: the
   presence of the master or pilot saves the ship, his absence is the
   cause of the shipwreck. And so the schools say, God inclines to good
   efficienter, working it in us; and to evil deficienter, withdrawing his
   grace from us. A like expression you have Ps. cxli. 4, Incline not my
   heart to any evil thing.' God may as a lord do what he pleaseth with
   his own; and as a just judge may give over our hearts to their own
   natural wicked inclination; therefore David deprecates it as a judicial
   act.

   Not to covetousness.' This is mentioned because our too much love to
   worldly things is the special hindrance of obedience; it takes off our
   hearts from the love and care of it. And then, when he saith Not to
   covetousness,' he herein implies his own esteem and choice, as
   preferring God's testimonies above all riches; and possibly intimates
   the sincerity of his aims, that he would not serve God for temporal
   advantages and worldly respects. Satan accuseth Job for such a perverse
   respect: Job i. 9, Doth Job serve God for nought?' David, to prevent
   such a surmise, that he was not led by any thought of gain to desire
   godliness, saith, To thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.'

   Two points offer themselves from these words:--

   1. That it is God alone that sets our hearts right, or inclines them
   from their carnal bent to his own testimonies.

   2. That covetousness, or the flagrant desire of worldly things, is a
   great let or hindrance from complying with God's testimonies.

   Doct. 1. That it is God alone that sets our hearts right, or inclines
   them from their carnal bent to his own testimonies.

   That I shall illustrate by these considerations:--

   First, The heart of man must have an object unto which it is inclined
   or whereunto it doth cleave; for it is like a sponge, that being
   thirsty in itself, sucks in moisture from other things; it is a chaos
   of desires, seeking to be filled with something from without. We were
   made for another, to be happy in the enjoyment of a being without us;
   therefore man must have something to love; for the affections of the
   soul cannot lie idle and without an object: Ps. iv. 6, The many will
   say, who will show us any good?' We all hunt about for a match for our
   affections, for some good to satisfy us.

   Secondly, The heart being destitute of grace, is wholly carried out to
   temporal things. Why? Because they are next at hand, and suit best with
   our fleshly natures. I say, out of a despair of meeting with better, we
   take up with those objects that we are most conversant about, which are
   carnal contentments, the good of which we can apprehend and relish with
   our natural faculties. There are two reasons of the addictedness that
   is in man's heart to temporal things--(1.) Natural inclination; and
   (2.) Inveterate custom.

   1. Natural inclination. That there is a greater proneness in us to evil
   than good is clear, not only by scripture but by plain experience. Now
   whence is it that we are thus viciously disposed? The soul being
   created by God, he infuseth no evil into it, for that would not stand
   with the holiness of his nature. I answer--Though the soul be created
   by God, yet it is created destitute of grace or original righteousness;
   and being destitute of the image of God, or original righteousness, can
   only close with things present and known, having no other light and
   principle to guide it. Now things known and things present, they are
   the pleasures of the body, as meats, drinks, natural generation,
   wealth, and honour. Now, these being wholly minded, avert us from the
   love and study of supernatural things. It is true these things are good
   in themselves, and that self-love which carrieth us out to them is
   naturally good; but though it be naturally good, it proves morally evil
   when the love of these things destroys the love of God, which must
   needs be if we be destitute of grace. The love of ourselves and outward
   things necessarily grows inordinate, not being guided and directed by
   grace. It is a rule among divines, Si non inest quod inesse deberet,
   necessario inerit quod non inesse deberet--a privation falling upon an
   active subject (such as the soul of man is) doth necessarily infer
   disorder and irregularity in its operations. Take away light from the
   air, it must be dark, and when the sun is down it must be night. So it
   is if grace be taken away. The great work of grace is to make God our
   last end and our chiefest good. Now, this last end being changed, all
   things must needs run into disorder with man. Why? For the last end is
   principium universalissimum, the most universal principle upon which
   all moral perfections depend. Look, as Adam and Eve, after they had
   eaten the forbidden fruit, forfeited the image of God, and were
   polluted, so we. Why? Did God infuse pollution and filthiness in them?
   or had the fruit any such poisonous quality? No; their last end was
   changed, which is the great principle that runs through all our
   actions; and when our end is changed, then all runs to disorder. They
   fell from God, whom be fore they made their chiefest good, and their
   last end. I say, they fell from God as envious, false, and wishing ill
   to them; and by the devil's instigation turned to the creature to find
   happiness in them, against the express will and command of God. As the
   first man was infected, so are all men wholly perverted, for sin still
   consists in a conversion from God to the creature, Jer. ii. 13; 2 Tim.
   iii. 4. By the change of our end all moral goodness is lost, for all
   means are subordinate to the last end, and are determined by it. Now
   necessarily thus it will be without grace; there will be a conversion
   of a man to the creature and the body, with the conveniences and
   comforts thereof; the interest and concernments of the body are set up
   instead of God. For though the soul cometh down from the superior
   world, yet it soon forgets its divine original, and being put into the
   body, it conforms itself to the body, and only adheres to objects
   visible and corporeal. As water, being put into a square vessel, hath a
   square form, into a round vessel, hath a round form, so the soul, being
   infused into the body, is led by it, and accommodates all its faculties
   and operations to the welfare of the body. And thence comes our
   ignorance, averseness of soul from holiness, unruliness of appetite,
   and inclination to sensual things. In short, without grace, a man's
   mind is carried headlong after worldly vanities. As water runs where it
   finds a passage, so the soul of man, being destitute of the image of
   God, finds a passage towards temporal things, and so runs out that way.

   2. As man is thus corrupted and prone to worldly objects by natural
   inclination, so by inveterate custom. As soon as we are born we follow
   our sensual appetite, and the first years of man's life are merely
   governed by sense; and the pleasures thereof are born and bred up with
   us, and deeply engraven in our natures; and by constant living in the
   world, conversing with corporeal objects, the taint increaseth upon us,
   and so we are more deeply dyed and settled in a worldly frame, and we
   live in the pursuit of honour, gain, and pleasure, according as the
   particular temper of our bodies and course of our interest do determine
   us: Jer. xiii. 23, Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard
   his spots? then may ye also do good that are accustomed to do evil.'
   Custom is as another nature, and hardly left. We find by experience,
   the more we are accustomed to any course of life, the more we delight
   in it, and are weaned from it with a very great difficulty. Every act
   disposeth the soul to the habit, and after the habit or custom is
   produced, then every new deliberate act adds a stiffness of bent or
   sway unto the faculty into which the custom is seated; and the longer
   this evil custom is continued the more easily are we carried away with
   temptations that suit it, and more hardly swayed to the contrary. Now
   this stiffness of will in a carnal course is that which the scripture
   calls hardness of heart and a heart of stone, for a man is ensnared by
   these customs; and of all customs, covetousness or worldliness is the
   most dangerous. Why? Because this is a sin of more credit and less
   infamy in the world, and this will multiply its acts in the soul most,
   and works incessantly: Having hearts exercised with covetous
   practices,' 2 Peter ii. 14.

   Well, then, these lusts being born and bred up with us from our
   infancy, they plead prescription. Religion, that comes afterward, and
   finds us biassed and prepossessed with other inclinations, which by
   reason of long use is not easily broken and shaken off; as upon trial,
   whenever we are called upon, or begin to apply ourselves to the ways of
   life, we shall be easily sensible of this stiffness of heart and
   obstinacy that bends us another way.

   Thirdly, The heart being thus deeply engaged to temporal things, or
   things base and earthly, it cannot be set upon that which is spiritual
   and heavenly; for David propounds these things here as inconsistent, To
   thy testimonies Lord, and not to covetousness.' If the heart be
   addicted to worldly things, it is necessarily averse from God and his
   testimonies; for the habitual bent of the heart to any one sin is
   inconsistent with grace or a thorough obedience to God's will. That
   which the heart is inclined to hath the throne. Now, when we inquire
   after grace, Have I grace or no? have I the work of God upon my heart?
   the question is not what there is of God in the heart, but whether that
   of God hath the throne. Something of God is in the heart of the
   wickedest man that is, and something of sin in the best heart that is;
   therefore which way is the sway, the bent, the habitual and prevailing
   inclination of the soul? what hath the dominion? Sin hath not the
   dominion, for ye are not under the law, but under grace.' Rom. vi. 14.
   What hath the prevalency of the heart? Though the conscience takes part
   with God, as it may strongly in a wicked man, yet which way is the bent
   of our souls? And as all sin in its reign is inconsistent with grace,
   so much more worldly affections: Mat. vi, 24, No man can serve two
   masters,' &c. It is as inconsistent as for a man to look two ways at
   once. And the Chaldee on this very text, Incline my heart to thy
   testimonies,' reads it, and not unto mammon.' You cannot be inclined to
   God and mammon: 1 John ii. 15, If any man love the world, the love of
   the Father is not in him.' The world draws men from the love of God and
   from his service, and labour after temporal things deadens and
   hindereth us from looking after things which are eternal, and we lose
   the relish of things to come and things spiritual, the more the love of
   worldly things doth increase upon us. The schoolmen say of worldliness,
   it is that which most of all draws us off from God as our last end and
   chief good, and makes us cleave to the creature; therefore it is called
   adultery' and idolatry:' adultery, James iv. 4, as it draws away our
   love, delight, and complacency from God; and idolatry, Col. iii. 5, as
   it diverts our trust, and placeth it in wealth and sublunary things.
   The glutton or sensualist's love is withdrawn from God, and therefore
   his belly is said to be his god, Phil. iii. 19. Interpretatively that
   is a man's God which is the last end of his actions, and upon which all
   his thoughts, affections, and endeavours run most. But now covetousness
   is not only a spiritual fornication, and adultery which draws off our
   affections from God, but idolatry. Considering our relation in the
   covenant, it is spiritual adultery; and above this, it is idolatry,
   because men think they can never be happy, nor have any comfortable
   being, un less they have a great portion of these outward things.

   Fourthly, This frame of heart cannot be altered until we be changed by
   God's grace. Why? For there is no principle remaining in us that can
   alter this frame, or make us so far unsatisfied with our present state
   as to look after other things, that can break the force of our natural
   and customary inclinations. There are three things which lie against
   the change of the heart towards God.

   1. There is nature, which wholly carrieth us to please the flesh, and
   inordinately to seek the good of the body. Now nature cannot rise
   higher than itself, and determine itself to things above its sphere and
   compass; as the philosopher saith of water, it cannot be forced to rise
   higher than its fountain. Our actions cannot exceed their principle,
   which is self-love. But besides this--

   2. There is custom added to nature, which makes it more stiff and
   obstinate; so that if it may be supposed that conscience is sensible of
   our mistake and ill choice, and some weighty considerations should be
   propounded to us, as it is easy to show that eternal things are far
   better than temporal, and spiritual things than carnal;--if conscience,
   I say, should come in, and represent the ill state wherein we are, yet
   because the poise of our hearts doth customarily carry us another way,
   we are not inclined to God, or to the concernments of eternal life; for
   it is not argument merely will do it. In a pair of scales, though the
   weights be equal, yet if the scales be not equal there may be wrong
   done; so though the argument be never so powerful, yet if the heart
   that weighs them be customarily engaged and carried away with the
   momentary and cursory delights of the flesh, alas! these will sway us,
   and affect us more than all those pure, everlasting delights we may
   enjoy by communion with God. In all reason a lesser good should not be
   preferred before a greater; and worldly delights, which are not only
   base and dreggy, but also short and vanishing, and the occasion of much
   evil to us, these should not be preferred before eternal happiness. But
   here lies our misery, though the pleasures which affect us be less in
   themselves, yet our habitual propension and customary inclination to
   them is greater. Look, as in a pair of balances, though the weight of
   the one side be less, yet if the scales be not even and equally
   pendant, if the beam be longer on the side than the other, the lesser
   weight on the longer side of the beam will overpoise the greater weight
   on the shorter side; so while the soul is perverted by evil customs,
   and the heart doth hang more to temporal things than to spiritual and
   eternal, certainly there must be something from above that must
   determine us. Man's heart can never be swayed until the Lord joins the
   assistance of his grace.

   3. There is God's curse, or penal hardness. For as nature groweth into
   custom, so by our sinful customs God is provoked, and doth with draw
   those common influences of grace by which our condition might be
   bettered, and in justice he gives up our hearts to their own sway;
   Hosea iv. 17, Ephraim is joined to his idols, let him alone;' Ps.
   lxxxi. 12, So I gave them up unto their own heart's lusts, and they
   walked in their own counsels.' So that we have not those frequent
   checks and gripes of conscience, those warnings and good thoughts as
   before. Let him alone;' providence, let him alone; conscience, let him
   alone; and the sinner is left to his own will. Therefore, out of all
   the work remaineth to be God's alone, who only hath authority to
   pardon, and power to cure the distempers of our hearts; he hath
   authority to take off that judicial hardness which he as a judge may
   continue upon us, and which the saints deprecate in these forms of
   speech, Incline my heart to thy testimonies,' &c. And so he hath power
   to take off the natural and customary hardness which is in us, For the
   heart of man is in his hand as the rivers of water,' Prov. xxi. 1, and
   can as easily draw us out to good as water followeth when the trench is
   cut. But what needeth more arguing in the case? David saith here, Lord,
   incline mine heart; and 1 Kings viii. 58, The Lord be with us, that he
   may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and keep his
   commandment.' It is God's work alone to bend the crooked stick the
   other way. But you will say, this work sometimes is ascribed to man;
   for instance, ver. 112 of this psalm, I have inclined my heart to
   perform thy statutes alway, even unto the end;' and Josh. xxiv. 23,
   Incline your heart unto the Lord God of Israel.'

   I answer--These places do only note our subordinate operation, or the
   voluntary motion and resolution on our part. When God hath bent us and
   inclined us to do his will, when God hath made our love to act, and
   poised us to that which is spiritual and good, then we do incline, we
   bend our hearts this way. So that all these expressions do not imply a
   co-ordinate but subordinate operation on man's part.

   Fifthly, In this change there is a weakening of the old inclination to
   carnal vanities, and there is a new bent and frame of heart bestowed
   upon us. The heart is taken off from the love of base objects, and then
   fixed upon that which is good: Deut. xxx. 6, The Lord thy God will
   circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the Lord thy
   God with all thine heart,' &c. First, there is a circumcising, a paring
   away of the fleshliness of the heart; then an unfeigned love to God. So
   Ezek. xxxvi. 26, 27, I will take away the stony heart out of your
   flesh, and I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my
   statutes.' First the untowardness of the will and affections is
   removed, and then a heart is given to us, which is tract able and
   pliable for gracious purposes. First the weeds are plucked up, then we
   are planted wholly with a right seed. Or first we cast off the old
   man,' then put on the new,' Eph. iv. 22, 23. The natural inbred
   corruption, which daily grows worse and worse, is more and more done
   away, as we cast off the old rotten garment when we put on the new.

   Sixthly, When our hearts are thus changed, they are ever and anon apt
   to return to the old bent and bias again. For David, a renewed man, he
   doth thus speak to God, O Lord, incline my heart to thy testimonies,
   and not unto covetousness.' He found his heart bowing and warping back
   again, and being sensible of the distemper, complains of it to God. The
   inclination that is in them to evil is not so lost to the best of God's
   children, but it will return unless God still draw us after him. The
   spouse saith, Cant. i. 4, Draw me, and we will run after thee.' The
   spouse of Christ, those that were already taken into communion with
   him, they say, Draw me.' This is not a work to be done once and no
   more, but often to be renewed and repeated in the soul; for there are
   some relics of our natural averseness from God, and enmity to the yoke
   of his word, yet left in the heart: Gal. v. 17, The flesh lusteth
   against the spirit.' There are two active principles within us, and
   they are always warring one upon another. Therefore there is need not
   only to be inclined at first, and drawn towards God, but we must go to
   him again and again, and pray to him daily that he would continue the
   bent of our hearts right, and weaken carnal affections, that we may
   mind better things.

   Use 1. The use is to set you right in point of doctrine as to the
   necessity of grace, to bring us into a state of doing God's will;
   because some do grant the necessity of grace in words, but in deed they
   make it void.

   Pelagius at first gave all to nature, acknowledged no necessity of
   divine grace; but when this proud doctrine found little countenance, he
   called nature by the name of grace; and when that deceit was
   discovered, he acknowledged no other grace but outward instruction, or
   the benefit of external revelation, that a man might by the word of God
   know and be put in mind of his duty. Being yet driven further, he
   acknowledged the grace of pardon, and before a man could do anything
   acceptably there was a necessity of the remission of sin, and then he
   might obey God perfectly. But that not sufficing, he acknowledged
   another grace, the example of Christ, which doth both secure our rule
   and encourage our practice; and so made the grace of Christ consist,
   not in the secret efficacy of his Spirit, but only in the example of
   Christ. But being driven further to acknowledge the same internal grace
   (I mean, his followers), they made it to consist in some illumination
   of the understanding, or some moral persuasion, by probable argument to
   excite the will; and this not absolutely necessary, but only for
   facilitation, as a horse to a journey, which otherwise a man might go
   on foot. Ay! but the law was impossible through our flesh.' Rom. viii.
   3. But all this is short of that divine grace that is necessary.

   Now, there are others grant the secret influences of God's grace, but
   make the will of man be to a co-ordinate cause with God; namely, that
   God doth propound the object, hold forth inducing considerations, give
   some remote power and assistance; but still there is an indifferency in
   the will of man to accept and refuse as liketh him best. Be sides all
   this, there is a prevailing efficacy, or a real influence from the
   Spirit of God on the will, whereby it is moved infallibly and certainly
   to close with those things which God propounds unto him. God worketh
   efficaciously and determinately, not leaving it to the liberty of man's
   will to choose or refuse it, but man is determined, inclined, and
   actually poised by the grace of God to that which is good.

   Use 2. To press you to lay to heart these things.--(1.) Be sensible of
   the strength and sway of thy affections to temporal objects; there the
   work begins. And till we have a sight of the disease, we are not
   careful after a remedy. David, though regenerate, took notice of some
   worldly tendencies in his heart; and if we observe our hearts, we shall
   find so. Paul groaned under the relics of the flesh, and so should we
   under our bondage by sin. (2.) And then bewail it to the Lord, I am as
   a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke,' Jer. xxxi. 18, to bewail this
   stiffness of heart, and the treachery of sin, whereby we are enchanted,
   wholly bent to that which is evil. (3.) And observe the abating of this
   strength of affection, and weaning of thy soul from such desires; for
   then the work of grace goes on when we begin to savour other things,
   and have-inclinations of soul towards that which is heavenly and
   spiritual: They that are after the flesh do mind the things of the
   flesh, and they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit,'
   (4.) And then to press you to perpetual watchfulness over your own
   hearts, that you do not return to your old bent and bias again; for
   certainly thus they will do if we do not keep a severe hand over them,
   and be lifting up our affections to things that are above, where God
   is, and Christ at the right hand of God.

SERMON XLI.

   And not unto covetousness.--Ver. 36.

   Doct. 2. That covetousness, or an inordinate desire of worldly things,
   is the great let or hindrance to complying with God's testimonies.

   By way of proof, I need to produce but that scripture, 1 John v. 3, 4,
   For this is |the love of God, that we keep his commandments, and his
   commandments are not grievous; for whatsoever is born of God overcometh
   the world.' The reason implies that if We had a greater conquest over
   worldly affections, it would not be so grievous to us to keep God's
   commandments; for the apostle's argument is built upon this
   supposition, that God's commands are only burdensome to them that lie
   under the power of carnal affections. All the difficulty in obedience
   cometh from our temptations to the contrary. Now all or most
   temptations from Satan and our own flesh have their strength from the
   world, and its suitableness to our affections. Master your love to the
   world, and temptations lose their strength.

   To make this more clear, let us--

   1. What is covetousness.

   2. How it hindereth from complying with God's testimonies.

   First, What is covetousness? I shall give the nature, the causes, the
   discoveries of it.

   First, the nature of it. It is an inordinate desire of having more
   wealth than the Lord alloweth in the fair course of his providence, and
   a delight in worldly things as our chiefest good.

   1. There is an unsatisfied desire of having more. We may desire
   temporal good things for necessity and service. We carry about earthly
   tabernacles, that must be supported with earthly things, and therefore
   God alloweth us to seek them in a moderate way. But now when these
   desires grow vehement and impatient of check, and by an immodest
   importunity are still craving for more, it is an evil disease, and it
   must be looked unto in time, or it will prove baneful to the soul.
   There is a vital heat necessary to our preservation, and there are un
   natural predatorious heats which argue a distemper. See how this desire
   is expressed in scripture: 1 Tim. vi. 9, 10, He that will be rich falls
   into temptation and a snare,' &c. He doth not say, He that is rich,
   but, He that will be rich; he that hath fixed that as his scope, and
   makes that his business; for the will is known by fixedness of
   intention, and earnestness of prosecution: he that makes it his work to
   grow great in the world. So Prov. xv. 27, He that is greedy of gain
   troubles his own house.' Desires are the vigorous motions of the will;
   when they are eager, impatient, and immoderate, then they discover this
   evil inclination of soul. So Eccles. v. 10, He that loveth silver shall
   not be satisfied with silver, nor he that loveth abundance with
   increase. This is also vanity.' There is a spiritual dropsy, when our
   desires grow the more the more we receive and enjoy; as fire by the
   addition of new fuel grows more fierce the more the flame increaseth.
   The contrary to this is expressed by Agur, and should be the temper of
   every gracious heart: Prov. xxx. 8, Give me neither poverty nor riches:
   feed me with food convenient for me.' As to worldly things we should be
   indifferent, and refer ourselves to the fair allowance of God's
   providence, that he might carve out our portion, and do by us according
   to his own pleasure.

   2. Not only this greedy thirst discovereth covetousness, but a
   complacency, delight, and acquiescency of soul in worldly enjoyments.
   So Christ Jesus in his parable against covetousness brings in a carnal
   wretch singing lullabys to his soul: Luke xii. 19, Soul, thou hast much
   goods laid up for many years; take thy ease, eat, drink, and be merry.'
   He doth not wish for more, but pleaseth himself with what he had
   already, and yet in his language would Christ impersonate and set forth
   the dispositions of a covetous heart. So we are cautioned, Ps. lxii.
   10, If riches increase, set not your hearts upon them.' When we set up
   our rest here, and look no further, we are guilty of this sin.

   But now, because we may delight in our portion, and take comfort in
   what God hath given us; let us see when our delight in temporal things
   is a branch of covetousness. I answer--When we delight in them to the
   neglect of God, and the lessening of our joy in his service, and our
   hopes of eternal life are abated and grow less lively; when we so
   delight in them as to neglect God and the sweet intercourse we should
   have in him. Therefore covetousness is called idolatry, Eph. v. 5; Col.
   iii. 5, as it robs God of our trust, while we build upon un certain
   riches as a stable happiness, and the best assurance of our felicity:
   Mark x. 23, 24, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the
   kingdom of God!' And when the disciples wondered, our Saviour answered,
   How hard is it for them that trust in riches!' &c.; that is, that set
   their confidence in them in that degree and mea sure as is only due to
   God. Then it is called adultery, James iv. 4, because out of love to
   worldly things we can dispense with our love to God and delight in him,
   as the harlot draws away the affection from the lawful wife. In short,
   when we seek them and prize them, with the neglect of better, as
   spiritual and heavenly things are, Luke xii. 21; Mat. vi. 19-21, 33.
   Next to the love of God we must love ourselves, and there first our
   souls. Now we are besotted and enchanted with the love of the world, so
   as to slight the favour of God and the hopes of blessedness to come,
   this is adultery spiritual, and sets up another chief good.

   Secondly, Let us come to the causes of it, and they are two--distrust
   of God's providence, and discontent with God's allowance. You have both
   in one place: Heb. xiii. 5, Let your conversation be without
   covetousness, and be content with such things as you have.' These two,
   distrust and discontent, have a mutual influence upon one another.
   Distrust breeds discontent with our present portion, and discontent
   breeds ravenous desires, and ravenous desires breed distrust; for when
   we set God a task to provide for our lusts, certainly he will never do
   it. I say, we can never depend upon him that he should provide for our
   lusts.

   1. For the first of these, that is, distrust, or a fear of want,
   together with a low esteem of God's providence, which maketh us so
   unreasonably solicitous about outward provisions; therefore when Christ
   would cure our covetousness he seeks to cure our distrust: Luke xii.
   29, And seek ye not what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither
   be ye of doubtful mind.' Do not hover like meteors in the air,
   antedating your cares, making yourselves more miserable by your own
   suspicions, and your own fears what shall become of you and yours. So
   Mat. vi. 34, Take no thought for to-morrow; sufficient for the day is
   the evil thereof.' I say, this carking about future things makes us so
   impatient and earnest after present satisfaction. God trained up his
   people to a waiting upon his providence. Manna fell from heaven every
   day, so* sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.' Every day we need
   look no further: Give us this day our daily bread.' But men fear future
   need and poverty, and so would help themselves by their own carking. So
   then diffidence of God's promises is the latent evil which lodgeth in
   the heart. Sordid sparing and greedy getting, that is on the top; but
   that which lies near the heart is distrust. We incline to sensible
   things, and cannot tell how to be well without them, and so resolve to
   shift for ourselves.

   2. Discontent. Men have not so much as their rapacious desire* crave,
   though they are allowed moderate supplies to keep them till they go to
   heaven; and therefore everything that they get serves but as a bait to
   draw them on further, so they are always joining house to house, and
   laying field to field,' Isa. v. 8. When once men transgress the bounds
   of contentment prescribed by God, there is no stop or stay. Look, as
   the channel wears wider and deeper the more water falls into it, the
   water frets more and more; so the more outward things increase upon us,
   the more are our desires increased upon us. No man hath vast and
   unlimited thoughts at first. Men would be a little higher in the world,
   and a little better accommodated, and when they have that they must
   have a little more, then a little more; so they seize upon all things
   within their grasp and reach. Whereas if we had been content with our
   estate at first, we might have saved many a troublesome care, many a
   sin, many needless desires, and many a foolish and hurtful lust that
   proves our bane and torment. Be content with such things as you have
   now, or you will not be content hereafter; the lust will increase with
   the possession. As in some diseases of the stomach, purging doth better
   than repletion, not to feed the humour but to purge away the distemper;
   so here, it is not more that will satisfy us, but our lusts must be
   abated; if we were better satisfied with God's fair allowance we might
   be happy men much sooner than ever we shall be by great wealth.

   Thirdly, For the discoveries of this sin. Aristotle, as it is a moral
   vice, placeth it in two things--in a defect in giving, and an excess in
   taking. We may better express both in scripture phrase, by greedy
   getting, and unmeet withholding.

   1. Greedy getting, manifested either--

   [1.] By sinful means of acquisition; as lying, cozening, oppression,
   profaning the Lord's day, grinding the faces of the poor, carnal
   compliances, or any other such unjust or evil arts of gain. Men stick
   not at the means when their desires are so strongly carried out after
   the end: Prov. xxviii. 20, He that maketh haste to be rich cannot be
   innocent.' They leap over hedge and ditch, and all restraints of
   honesty and conscience, to compass their ends, all their endeavours are
   suited to their profit, and therefore consult not with conscience but
   with interest; and so prove treacherous to God, unthankful to parents,
   disobedient to magistrates, unfaithful to equals, unmerciful to
   inferiors, and care not whom they wrong, so they may thrive in the
   world.

   [2.] Though it go not so high as injustice, yet it appeareth by
   excessive labours, when endeavours are unreasonably multiplied, to the
   wrong both of the body and the soul. To the wrong of the body; see how
   they are described in scripture: Ps. cxxvii. 2, They rise early, they
   sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows;' and Ps. xxxix. 6, He
   disquieteth himself in vain.' By biting cares: Eccles. ii. 23, All his
   days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest
   in the night;' Eccles. iv. 8, There is no end of his labours, neither
   is his eye satisfied with riches.' Men are full of biting cares,
   cruciating unquiet thoughts, and so pierce themselves through with many
   sorrows,' 1 Tim. vi. 10. Riches are compared to thorns, not only for
   choking the good seed, but as piercing us through with many sorrows, as
   they prove troublesome comforts to a covetous man. And they wrong the
   soul when the heart is dead and oppressed by them: Luke^xxi. 34, Take
   heed lest your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness
   and the cares of this life.' The heart is burdened and oppressed, so as
   it hath no life and vigour for spiritual things, but is unbelieving and
   hard-hearted. The following the world brings a deadness upon us, and
   these preposterous and eager pursuits spend the strength of our
   affections, so that God and religion is jostled out and hath no due
   respect; the lean kine devour the fat, and Sarah is thrust out of doors
   instead of Hagar. Thus is greedy getting seen by unjust means, and the
   immoderate use of lawful means to the oppression of the body and soul.

   2. The other discovery is an unworthy detention: Prov. xi. 24, 4 There
   is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.' This
   covetousness in keeping is seen partly--

   [1.] By a sordid dispensing of our estate, or a denying of ourselves
   and others that relief which they should have. Ourselves: Eccles. iv.
   8, He bereaveth his own soul of good;' that is, of the comforts of the
   present life. But chiefly denying of others that relief they should
   have, a duty which our religion often presseth us to: Luke xii. 33,
   Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not
   old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief
   approacheth,. nor moth corrupteth.' We should rather scatter than
   hoard. The only means to discover we are not covetous, and to keep
   ourselves from the filth of this and other sins, is to be much in
   charity and distributing to those that have need: Luke xi. 41, Give
   alms of such things as you have, and behold all things are clean unto
   you.' It bringeth a blessing, purgeth the soul from that stain which it
   secretly contracteth by possessing worldly things, as our fingers are
   defiled by telling of money. But now, when men are backward this way,
   part with a drop of blood as soon as anything for God's use, when they
   shut up their bowels against the miseries of others, then is there this
   unmeet withholding.

   [2.] By our loathness to part with these things for the testimony of a
   good conscience. When we are put to trial, as Joseph was, to lose our
   coat that we may keep our consciences, I mean, to part with these
   outward things, or to defile ourselves by compliance with men; when we
   are put to this trial, those that will withhold and can dispense with
   the conscience of their duty to God, they are guilty of this sin: 2
   Tim. iv. 10, Demas hath forsaken us, having loved this present world.'
   Oh! it is a mighty insinuating thing that gets into the hearts of those
   that profess religion many times, so that they cannot deny any small
   conveniences for God. But the contrary is in those saints that take joy
   fully the spoiling of their goods, knowing that they have in heaven a
   better and an enduring substance,' Heb. x. 34.

   [3]. It appears again when we are loath to part with them in a way of
   submission to God's providence. Grief at worldly losses shows that
   these things have gained too much of our love. If we did rejoice in
   them' when we have them as if we rejoiced not,' then we would weep' for
   the loss of them as though we wept not,' 1 Cor. vii. 31. They are both
   coupled together, for one makes way for the other. So we find the other
   couple: 2 Peter i. 6, Add to temperance patience.' Where there is
   temperance and moderation in the use of worldly things, there will be
   patience, a submission to God in the loss of them. He lost them without
   grief, because he possessed them without love. The greatness of our
   affliction comes from our affection to these things. Did we sit more
   loose from our earthly comforts, it would not be so irksome to part
   with them. Grief is always a sign of affection: John xi. 34, and Jesus
   wept;' and then they said, Behold how he loved him!' When we are
   surprised with so great sorrow and trouble at the parting of outward
   things, it may be said, Behold how we loved them.' Our hearts are not
   at so great an indifferency as they should be. The root of all trouble
   of spirit lieth in our inordinate affection. Get off that, and then
   what comfortable lives might we live!

   Secondly, I am to show how it hindereth us from complying with God's
   testimonies. I shall do it by these arguments.

   1. It disposeth and inclineth the soul to all evil, to break every
   command and law of God: 1 Tim. vi. 10, The love of money is the root of
   all evil.' Let that once get into the heart and reign there, and then a
   man will stick at no sin, he becomes, as Chrysostom speaks, a ready
   prey to the devil; such a man doth but stand watching for a temptation,
   that Satan may draw him to one sin or other: Micah ii. 2, They covet
   fields, and take them by violence.' First they covet; suffer that to
   possess the heart, and a man will stop at nothing, but break out into
   all that is unseemly. Let Judas be but inured to the bag, and enchant
   his thoughts with this pleasing supposition that he may make a gain of
   his master, and he will soon come to a quid dabitis: What will ye give
   me, and I will deliver him unto you? he will soon betray him. Gehazi,
   let him but affect a reward, and he will dishonour God, and lay a
   stumbling-block in the way of that noble Syrian, that new convert: Is
   this a time to take bribes?' &c. Let Achan's heart be but tickled and
   pleased a little with the sight, and he will be purloining the wedge of
   gold and the Babylonish garment. Tell Balaam but of gold and silver,
   and he will curse Israel against his conscience, he will venture,
   though there be an angel in the way to stop him. Let Ahab but have a
   mind to Naboth's vineyard, and he will soon consent to Naboth's blood.
   Ananias and Sapphira, let them but look upon what they part withal, let
   but covetousness prevail upon their hearts, and they will keep back
   part of that which is dedicated to God. Simon Magus will deny religion,
   and return to his old sorceries again, that he may be some great one.
   So that there is no sin, be it never so foul, but covetousness will
   make it plausible, and reconcile it to the consciences of men.

   2. As it doth dispose and incline the soul to evil, so it incapacitates
   us for God's service, both in our general and particular calling.

   In our general calling, it makes us incapable of serving God. Why? It
   destroys the principle of obedience, is contrary to the matter of
   obedience, and it slights the rewards of obedience.

   [1.] It destroys the principle of obedience, which is the love of God.
   This is that which constrains us, which carrieth us out with life and
   sweetness in God's service. Now, 1 John ii. 5, If any man love the
   world, the love of the Father is not in him.' It destroys the principle
   that should act us in obedience.

   [2.] It is contrary to the matter of obedience, which are the commands
   of God. The commands of God and mammon are contrary, Mat. vi. 24. What
   are his commands? God saith, Pity the afflicted, relieve the miserable,
   venture all for a good conscience, seek heaven in the first place, seek
   it with your choicest affection, your earnest diligence. What saith
   mammon? Be sparing of your substance, follow the world as hard as you
   can, stick at nothing, lie, steal, swear, for swear, comply with the
   lusts of men, then you shall be rich. Well, now you see he that is
   ruled by mammon, or swayed by the inordinate love of worldly good, can
   never serve God; he is enslaved to another master; he loves wealth
   above all, he trusts it more than God's providence, he serves it more
   than God himself. Though his tongue dares not say that the earth is
   better than heaven, that the things of this life are better than the
   favour of God, yet his life saith it; for more of his heart and care
   runs out upon these matters. In short, it unfits you not only for one
   duty, but for all duties required of us. God's laws you know require
   respect to God, your neighbour, and to yourselves. Now he that is a
   slave to mammon, overcome by the love of worldly things, denies that
   which is due to God, his trust, his love, his choice affection. He
   denies what is necessary for his neighbour, and he denies what is
   comfortable for himself. He is unthankful to God, unmerciful to his
   neighbour, and cruel to himself.

   [3.] It slights the encouragements of obedience, which are the rewards
   of God, as it weakens our future hopes, and depresseth the heart from
   looking after spiritual and heavenly things. They despise their birth
   right for a mess of pottage; and when they are invited to the wedding,
   the choice things God hath provided for us in the gospel, they prefer
   their farm, oxen, merchandise before it. As it unfits us for the duty
   of our general, so for our particular. callings and relations.' The
   love of the world will make him altogether unfit for magistracy,
   ministry, the master of a family, or any such relation. In magistracy,
   who are the men that are qualified for that office? Exod. xviii. 21,
   Such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness.' Let covetousness
   possess the heart a little, and it will make a man act unworthily,
   timorously, with a base heart. Nay, for a piece of bread will that man
   transgress. Take a minister, and what a poor meal-mouthed minister will
   he make if his heart be carried out with love to worldly things?
   Therefore it is the qualification of his person: 1 Tim. iii. 3, Not
   greedy of filthy lucre.' Let a minister be greedy of gain, it makes him
   sordid, low-spirited, flattering and daubing, to curry favour with men,
   more intent upon his gain and profit than the saving of souls. So for
   his work: 1 Peter v. 2, Feed the flock of God which is among you; not
   for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind.' What a low flat ministry will
   that be, that is inspired with no other aim and impulsion but the sense
   of his own profit! If that be his great inducement to undertake that
   calling, and his great encouragement in discharging the duty of that
   calling, how will men strain themselves to please men, especially great
   ones, and writhe themselves into all postures and shapes that they may
   soothe the humours and lusts of others! He will curse where God hath
   blessed, if he be such as Balaam, who loved the wages of un
   righteousness.' It is a powerful imperious lust, saith God, Will you
   pollute me for handfuls of barley and pieces of bread, to slay the
   souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not
   live?' Then you shall have them declaiming against the good, hardening
   the evil, complying with the fashions of the world. So in other
   callings. If a man be called to be a master of a family: Prov. xv. 27,
   He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house.' What a trouble and
   burden will this man be to his servants and all about him! and how
   little will he glorify God in that relation! Nay, in all other stations
   this will make him an oppressing landlord, a false tradesman, an ill
   neighbour; and therefore it is the very pest and bane of human
   societies. Thus you see how it unfits us for the service of God, both
   in our general and particular calling.

   3. It hinders the receiving of good, and those means of reformation
   that should make us better. It fills us with prejudice against what
   ever shall be spoken for God and for the concernments of another world:
   Luke xvi. 14, And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all
   these things, and derided him.' Come with any strict and holy doctrine
   that shall carry out men to the interest of another life, and they will
   make a scoff at it. If the word stir us a little, and make us anxious
   and thoughtful about our eternal condition, the thorns, which are the
   cares of this world, choke the good seed, Mat. xiii.; it stifles our
   conviction, while it distracts our head with cares, and puts us out of
   all thought about things to come. If a man begins to do some outward
   thing, it makes him soon weary of religion and attendance upon the
   duties thereof: Amos viii. 5, When will the Sabbath be gone, that we
   may set forth wheat?' They think all lost that is bestowed upon God. As
   Seneca said of the Jews, they were a foolish people, they lost the full
   seventh of their lives because of the Sabbath; so they think all
   Sabbath time lost. Nay, it distracts in duty: Ezek. xxxiii. 31, With
   their mouth they show much love, but their heart goeth after their
   covetousness.' It interlines our prayers, and the world will still be
   creeping; and when we are offering incense to God, we shall be mingling
   sulphur and brimstone of worldly thoughts with it; our minds will be
   taken up with worldly projects; and then it perverts the good we do, as
   they followed Christ for the loaves, John vi. It turneth religion into
   venale artificium, a trade to live by. If they do good things, it is
   for worldly ends; they make a market of their devotion, as the
   Shechemites would be circumcised, for then their substance and their
   cattle will be ours.

   Use 1. It informs us of the evil of covetousness. Most will stroke it
   with a gentle censure, and say, Such an one is a good man, but a little
   worldly, as if it were no great matter to be so. Nay, they are apt to
   applaud those that are tainted with it: Ps. x. 3, He blesseth the
   covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth.' He that getteth honour and riches
   by hook and crook is the only prudent and serious man in their account.
   It is a foul sin, though the men of the world will not believe it.
   Surely we have too mild thoughts of it, therefore do not watch, and
   strive against it. The sensualist shames himself before others; but
   covetousness is worse than prodigality in many respects, as being not
   occasioned by the distemper of the body, as excess of drinking and lust
   is, but by the depravation of the mind; and when other sins decay, this
   grows with them; it is an incurable dropsy, Luke xii. 15. The words are
   doubled for the more vehemency. Christ doth not only say, Take heed,'
   but Take heed and beware of covetousness.' Sins that are more gross and
   sensual are more easily discovered, and a sinner sooner reclaimed; but
   this is a secret sin, that turns away the heart from God, and is
   incessantly working in the soul. Look, as the scripture tells you, to
   make you careful against rash anger, that it is murder, 1 John iii. 15;
   so to make you careful to avoid covetousness, the scripture tells you
   it is idolatry; and is that a small crime? What, to set up another God?
   Who are you that dare to harbour so great an evil in your bosom, and
   make no great matter of it? Will you dethrone that God which made you,
   and set up another in his stead? How can you hope he will be good to
   you any longer when you offer him so vile an abuse? It is adultery; it
   is a breach of your conjugal vow. You promised to renounce the world in
   your baptism, and gave up yourselves to his service, and will you
   cherish your whorish and disloyal affections that will carry you to the
   world in God's stead? We cannot think badly enough of such a sin.

   Use 2. If covetousness be the great let and hindrance from keeping
   God's testimonies, then let us examine ourselves, Are we guilty of it?
   Doting upon the creature, and an inordinate affection to sensible
   things, is a natural, a hereditary disease, more general than we are
   aware of: Jer. vi. 13, From the least to the greatest every one is
   given to covetousness.' It is a relic of original sin, and it is in
   part in the godly man, though it do not bear sway in him; there is too
   much of this worldly wretched inclination in a godly man's heart. Nay,
   those that seem most remote from it may be tainted with it. A prodigal,
   that is lavish enough upon his lusts, yet he may be sparing to good
   uses; so he is covetous; as the rich man that fared deliciously every
   day yet denied a crum to Lazarus, Luke xvi. 19-21. Those that aim at no
   great matter for themselves, that have not ravenous impatient desires,
   yet may be full of envy at the increase of others, and vexed to see
   them flourish; it may be they have no ability or opportunity to do
   anything for themselves, but have an evil eye at the increase of
   others. Most men are more industrious for the world, whereas they are
   overly and slight in heavenly matters; and that is evidence enough.
   Some are not greedy, but they are too sparing. They seek not, it may
   be, a higher estate, but they are too much delighted with present
   comforts. The gallant that pampers himself, and wastes freely upon his
   pride and lusts, may laugh in his sleeve, and say, I am free from this
   evil; yet his heart desires wherewith to feed his excess and bravery
   and pride. Covetousness may be entertained as a servant where it is not
   entertained as a master; entertained as a servant to provide oil and
   fuel to make other sins burn. Therefore let us see indeed whether we be
   not guilty of this sin?

   1. It may be discovered by frequent thoughts, which are the genuine
   issue of the soul, and discover the temper of the mind; thoughts either
   by way of contemplation or contrivance. By way of contemplation, when
   our minds only run upon earthly things, and that with a savour and
   sweetness: Phil. iii. 19, Minding earthly things.' What a man doth muse
   upon, most think of when he is alone, and speak of in company, that
   will show him the temper of his heart. When men think of the world, and
   speak of the world, their heart is where their treasure is, Mat. vi.
   21. Nay, when they cannot disengage themselves from these thoughts in
   God's worship; their hearts go away in covetousness, Ezek. xxxiii. 31.
   Or else thoughts by way of contrivance: Isa. xxxii. 7, 8, The liberal
   man deviseth liberal things, and the wicked man deviseth wicked
   devices.' The deliberations and debates of the soul discover the temper
   of it. A carnal heart is altogether exercised in carnal projects, as
   the rich fool discoursed and dialogised with himself. When men are
   framing endless projects, carking and caring, not how to grow good and
   gracious, but great and high in the world, they discover the spirit of
   the world.

   2. And as by thoughts, so by burning and urgent desires; they are the
   pulses of the soul. As physicians judge by appetite, so may you by
   desires. A spiritual dropsy or an unsatisfied thirst argues a
   distempered soul, when, like the horseleech's daughter, you still cry,
   Give, give, and you are never contented, but must have more.

   3. By the course of your lives and actions, and the uniformity of your
   endeavours. How shall we know who is the covetous man whom the Lord
   abhors? Luke xii. 21, So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and
   is not rich towards God,' a man that is always growing in estate, and
   never looks to his soul, and to be rich in grace, spiritual
   experiences, and rich in good works, which is chiefly meant there by
   being rich towards God, a man that seeks not the kingdom of God in the
   first place, for that which you love best you will seek for, you will
   be most careful and diligent to obtain. Well, then, when you mind
   heavenly things by the by, and are very slight in seeking and inquiring
   after God, furnishing your souls with grace, and getting assured hopes
   of heaven, and do not spy out advantages for the inward man, this evil
   disposition of the soul hath mightily invaded you, and then you can
   never do God any service.

   Use 3. To press you to take heed of this great sin; and if you would
   mortify it, mortify the roots of it, which are distrust and discontent.

   1. Distrust of God's providence. You that think you cannot do well
   unless you have a greater portion of worldly things, and that sets you
   upon carking, and if you have not this you cannot see how you and yours
   can be provided for; cure this. How? By God's promises: 1 Peter v. 7,
   Cast all your care upon him, for he careth for you.' Cannot you trust
   God upon the security of a promise? Cannot you go on in well-doing when
   the Lord hath said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee'? Cure it
   by observing the usual course of God's providence. God provides for the
   young ravens, he clothes the lilies. It is Christ's argument, Will he
   be more kind to a raven than a child? will he take more care of a
   flower than of a son, one that is in covenant with him? Cure it by holy
   maxims and considerations. Remember all dependeth upon God's blessing:
   Luke xii. 15, Take heed and beware of covetousness.' How should we do
   so? For a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things
   which he possesseth.' Alas! all is in God's hand, both being and
   well-being, life and estate, and all things else. God can soon blast
   abundance, and can relieve us in the deepest wants; he can give you a
   sufficiency in your deep poverty, 2 Cor. viii. 2. If you should go on
   carking and caring and feathering your nests, God may take you off, or
   set your nests on fire. A little serves the turn to bring us to heaven;
   and when our desires are moderate, God will not fail: Prov. xvi. 8,
   Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without
   right.'

   2. For discontent with your portion, that you may not always be craving
   more, meditate upon the baseness and vanity of worldly things. They do
   but deceive us with a vain show; they cannot give us any true joy of
   heart, or peace of conscience, or security against future evil; they
   cannot give you health of body, nor add one cubit to your stature, nor
   one day to your lives. Now, should we disquiet ourselves for a vain
   show? Shall there be such toil in getting, such fear of losing, when
   they are of no more use to us in the hour of death? When you need
   strength and comfort most, all these things will leave you shiftless,
   helpless, if they continue with you so long. Nay, reason thus: the more
   estate the more danger, the greater charge lieth upon you. Larger gates
   do but open to larger cares. There is more duty, more danger, more
   snares, more temptations. When you have more, you will be more
   difficultly saved. It is a truth pronounced by the Lord of truth, that
   it is a hard matter for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of
   heaven.' It will be more hard to keep the flesh in order, to guide our
   spirits aright in the ways of God. If you must needs be coveting,
   labouring, and carking, you are called to better things: John vi. 27,
   Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for the meat which
   endureth unto everlasting life;' Covet the best gifts,' 1 Cor. xii. 31.
   Be as passionate for grace as others are for the world. If once you
   were acquainted with these better things, it would be so with you; you
   would never leave the fair and fresh pastures of grace for the barren
   heath of the world. If you did once taste the sweet of heavenly things,
   then let dogs scramble for bones and scraps; you have hidden manna to
   feed upon, the sense of God's love to look after, hopes of everlasting
   glory wherewith to solace your souls. If once you did taste of these
   everlasting riches you would do so: 1 Tim. vi. 10, 11, there are many
   that through the love of money have erred from the faith, and pierced
   themselves through with many sorrows. But thou, man of God, flee these
   things, and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love,
   patience, meekness.' Let the men of the world, whose portion and
   happiness lieth here, scramble for these things; but you, that profess
   yourselves children of God, follow after all the gifts and graces of
   the Spirit; let that be your holy covetousness, to increase in these
   things.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON XLII.

   Turn thou away mine eyes from beholding vanity, and quicken thou me in
   thy way.--Ver. 37.

   DAVID still continueth his requests to God for grace, and entituleth
   him to the whole work. He had prayed before that God would incline his
   heart, now that he would Turn away his eyes from beholding worldly
   vanities.' In this prayer there are two branches--the one concerneth
   mortification, the other vivification.

   First. Turn away, then quicken, &c. The first request is for the
   removing the impediments to obedience, the other for addition of new
   degrees of grace. These two are fitly joined, for they have a natural
   influence upon one another; unless we turn way our eyes from vanity, we
   shall soon contract a deadness of heart. Nothing causeth it so much as
   an inordinate liberty in carnal vanities. When our affections are alive
   to other things, they are dead to God; therefore the less we let loose
   our hearts to these things the more lively and cheerful in the work of
   obedience. On the other side, the more the vigour of grace is renewed,
   and the habits of it quickened into actual exercise, the more is sin
   mortified and subdued. Sin dieth, and our senses are restored to their
   proper use. These two requests are fitly joined. Let us consider them
   asunder.

   1. Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity.' There observe--(1.) The
   object, vanity; (2.) The faculty, mine eyes; (3.) The act of grace
   desired, the removing of this faculty from this object.

   [1.] The object, vanity.' Thereby is meant carnal and worldly things,
   worldly pleasures, worldly honour, worldly profits; all these are
   called vanity, because they have no solid happiness in them, and do so
   easily fade and perish. Thus it is said, Prov. xxxi. 30, Favour is
   deceitful and beauty is vain.' The same is true of any other
   transporting objects: Vanity of vanities, all is vanity,' Eccles. i. 2;
   and Job xv. 31, Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity, for
   vanity shall be his recompense;' Rom. viii. 20, The creature is made
   vanity.' By vanity there is understood the vain things of the world,
   which do so often deceive us as to the happiness they promise.

   [2.] The faculty is mentioned, the eye. It is employed and commanded by
   the heart. But this enkindleth new flames there; and as it is set awork
   by it, so it sets the heart awork again. It is the instrument of
   increasing sin in us.

   [3.] The act, turn away.' Our evil delight is too apt to fix it, and
   become a snare to us, till God cure both heart and sense by grace. He
   prayeth not from beholding it altogether, but from beholding as a
   snare.

   Doct. It concerneth those that would walk with God to have their eyes
   turned away from worldly things. I shall give you the meaning in these
   propositions.

   1. He that would be quickened, carried out with life and vigour in the
   ways of God, must first be mortified, die unto sin. The apostle there
   speaks of the fruit of Christ's death, being dead unto sin before he
   can live to God, 1 Peter ii. 24. David first maketh it his request,
   Turn away mine eyes,' then Quicken.' Many would fain live with Christ,
   but first they must learn to die unto sin. It is impossible for sin and
   grace to live in the same subject.

   2. One great means of mortification is guarding the senses, eyes, and
   ears, and taste, and touch, that they may not betray the heart. I put
   it so general, because the man of God that is so solicitous about his
   eyes would not be careless of his ears and other senses. We must watch
   on all sides. When an assault is made on all sides, if one gate be
   open, it is as good as all were. The senses are the cinque ports by
   which sin is let out and taken in. The ingress and egress of sin is by
   the senses, and much of our danger lieth there; partly because there
   are so many objects that suit with our distempers, that do by them
   insinuate themselves into the soul, and therefore things long since
   seemingly dead will soon revive again, and recover life and strength.
   There are no means to keep the heart unless we keep the eye. And partly
   because in every creature Satan hath laid a snare for us, to steal away
   our hearts and affections from God. Partly because the senses are so
   ready to receive these objects from without to wound the heart, for
   they are as the heart is. If the heart be poisoned with sin, and be
   come a servant to it, so are the senses of our bodies weapons of
   unrighteousness.' Rom. vi. 13. Objects have an impression upon them
   answerable to the temper and the affections of the soul, and what it
   desireth they pitch upon; and therefore if we let the senses wander,
   the heart will take fire presently; and if we do not stop evil at the
   beginning, but let it alone to take head, we cannot stop it when we
   would, nor repress the motions of it from flying abroad.

   3. Above all senses the eye must be guarded.

   [1.] Because it is the noblest sense, given us for high uses. There is
   not only a natural use to inform us of things profitable and hurtful
   for the outward man, but a spiritual use to set before us those objects
   that may stir us and raise our minds to heavenly thoughts and
   meditations. For by beholding the perfection of the creatures we may
   admire the more eminent perfection of him that made them: Ps. xix. 1,
   The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his
   handiwork;' and Ps. viii. 3, When I considered thy heavens, the work of
   thy fingers, the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained.' David,
   when he walked abroad in a moon-shining night, admired the glory of the
   moon and stars; the moon and stars are mentioned because it was a night
   meditation; his heart was set awork by his eyes: Rom. i. 20, 21, For
   the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly
   seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal
   power and godhead,' &c. The perfections of the creatures are to draw us
   to God, and their imperfections and defects to drive us from
   themselves. The eye, as it is used, will either be a help or a snare;
   either it will let in the sparks of temptation, or enkindle the fire of
   true devotion. These are the windows which God hath placed in the top
   of the building, that man from thence may contemplate God's works, and
   take a prospect of heaven, the place of our eternal residence. Os
   homini sublime dedit--God made man with an erect countenance, not
   grovelling on the earth, but looking up to heaven, and viewing the
   glorious mansions above.

   [2.] Because they have a great influence upon the heart either as to
   good or evil, but chiefly to evil. In this corrupt state of man, orein
   gi'netai to` oran [13] --by looking we come to liking, and are brought
   inordinately to affect what we do behold: Num. xv. 39, That ye seek not
   after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a
   whoring;' Job xxxi. 7, If my step hath turned out of the way, and my
   heart walked after mine eyes.' These are the spies of the
   heart--brokers to bring it and the temptation together; the eye seeth,
   and then by gazing the heart lusteth, and the body acteth the
   transgression. It is more dangerous to see evil than to hear it; the
   impression is greater; ^the relation of anything doth not affect us so
   much as the sight of it. Those that hear of the fury of wars, firing of
   houses, ravishing of virgins, killing and wounding of men, and the
   like, can not have so deep a sense of those things as they that see it.
   The sight of heaven works more than the report of it; as Paul, when he
   had a sight of these things, was in an ecstasy: the look doth
   immediately work on the heart. Well, then, it is dangerous to fix the
   eye on enticing objects, for it exciteth more than hearsay.

   [3.] The eye must be looked to, because it hath been the window by
   which Satan hath crept in, and all manner of poison conveyed to the
   soul. I shall prove it--(1.) Doctrinally; (2.) Historically.

   (1.) I shall give you doctrinal assertions. The eye hath been the inlet
   of ail sin; as uncleanness: 2 Peter ii. 14, Having eyes full of
   adultery, and that cannot cease from sin, beguiling unstable souls,'
   &c. In the original, it is eyes full of the adulteress;' and the eye
   enkindles impure flames in the heart: Prov. vi. 25, Lust not after her
   beauty in thy heart, neither let her take thee with her eyelids.'
   Gazing on the beauty of women enkindleth foul flames within the breast,
   and we feel strange transports of soul when we give way to it. The evil
   heart is in its element when it is thus. Then covetousness gets into
   the heart by the eye: 1 John ii. 15, Love not the world, neither the
   things that are in the world: if any man love the world, the love of
   the Father is not in him.' And therefore the apostle, when he maketh a
   division of sin, he saith, For all that is in the world, the lust of
   the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the
   Father, but is of the world;' because the mind is so secretly enchanted
   with the love of those things it beholds, and are represented to it by
   the external senses. And Eccles. iv. 8, There is no end of all his
   labour, neither is his eye satisfied with riches;' that insatiable
   thirst is enkindled in the soul by beholding the splendour of outward
   things; it is born and bred and fed by it, and the heart is secretly
   enchanted with a love to it, and therefore we must have more of it.
   Again drunkenness: Prov. xxiii. 31, Look not thou upon the wine when it
   is red, when it giveth its colour in the cup, when it moveth itself
   aright;' that is so as to entice the heart to crave more and more till
   it cometh to excess. So envy: Mat. xx. 15, Is thine eye evil because
   mine is good?' The more they see and behold the flourishing of others,
   the more is their evil disposition nourished.

   (2.) Historical instances. Let me begin with the first transgression.
   It is said, Gen. iii. 6, And when the woman saw that the tree was good
   for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be
   desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof,' &c. She was
   first corrupted in her sense; gazing on the fruit with delight, that
   was the first sin, before eating. The devil tempted Christ when he
   sought to corrupt the second Adam: Mat. iv. 8, He taketh him up into an
   exceeding high mountain, and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world,
   and the glory of them.' He knew the best way to work was by sight, and
   though he could not prevail against Christ, he took that way that was
   most accommodate^ his purpose. And afterwards what an account have we
   in scripture, how many were wounded by their eyes: The devil knoweth
   that is the next way to work upon the heart. So Potiphar's wife: Gen.
   xxxix. 7, And it came to pass after these things that his master's wife
   cast her eyes upon Joseph, and she said, Lie with me.' There the
   mischief began; she pleased herself with looking on the Hebrew servant.
   So Achan: Josh. vii. 21, When I saw among the spoils a goodly
   Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of
   gold of fifty shekels' weight, then I coveted them and took them,' &c.
   First saw, then coveted, then took, and then hid; and then Israel falls
   before the Philistines, and he is attached by lots and brought to
   judgment. So Shechem and Dinah: Gen. xxxiv. 2, And when Shechem the son
   of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and
   lay with her, and defiled her.' Seeing always cometh between the sense
   and the heart. So of Samson: Judges xvi. 1, Samson went to Gaza, and
   saw there an harlot, and went in unto her.' So David was ensnared by
   looking on Bathsheba: 2 Sam. xi. 2, And it came to pass in an evening
   tide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of
   the king's house; and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and
   the woman was very beautiful to look upon.' That fired his heart, and
   brought such mischiefs upon him. Naboth's vineyard was hard by Ahab's
   palace, 1 Kings xxi. 1. It was ever in his eye, and therefore he is
   troubled and falls sick for it. So how many may thus complain that
   their souls have been by their eyes betrayed! As Jacob's sheep, by
   looking on the rods, brought forth young ones coloured by the rods, so
   our actions receive that from the objects we take in by the senses.

   Use is to reprove those that are so careless of their senses. When they
   are left at random they soon prove the ruin of the soul. Solomon giveth
   us the reason of his folly and warping from God: Eccles. iv. 10,
   Whatsoever mine eye desired I kept not from them.' I kept not mine eyes
   from any toy. Those men lie under the power of sin that let the boat
   run with the stream and never use any restraint; they are wafted down
   apace into the gulf of destruction. Those open the gates to the enemy,
   and give them free entertainment. A man that is care less of his senses
   is like a city without walls,' that lies open to all comers. The heart
   is a thoroughfare for sin and temptations. But because most men, yea,
   good men, have and may miscarry this way, whereby great mischiefs may
   come upon them, let me produce some considerations that they may see
   their folly that let their hearts run at random.

   1. Foul sinners [14] are awakened which we thought long since laid
   asleep, when we let the object strike too freely upon the soul. Who
   would have thought that David's heart should have been fired by a look?
   It is dangerous to dally with temptations, and to think no great harm
   will come of it. Stones running down hill are not easily stopped. So
   here; when we yield a little to Satan's temptations, he carries us away
   by force; we cannot stop when we please.

   2. Evil thoughts will be begotten in us, and they make us culpable
   before God, though they break not out into sinful acts. Looking causeth
   lusting, and that is adultery before God: Mat. v. 28, But I say unto
   you, Whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her, hath committed
   adultery with her already in his heart.' Christ came to restore the law
   to its spiritual sense. The Pharisees did not think the law broken but
   by outward gross acts and actual defilement; but Christ showeth that a
   wanton look is adultery; an envious look murders; the heart consenteth
   to sin though the body acts it not.

   3. By leaving the senses without a guard, evil dispositions are
   impressed upon us secretly. Though we are not aware of any sensible
   disorder for the present, the heart groweth vain and carnal by letting
   loose the eye to vanity. Job doth not only take notice of his eyes when
   they did stir up carnal thoughts for the present, Job xxxi. 7, but
   saith, If my eyes have walked after my heart, and if my steps have
   turned out of the way;' he speaks twice of the disorders of his eyes.
   The heart may be corrupted by the eye, and therefore it concerns you to
   set a guard upon the senses: Prov. iv. 25, Let thine eyelids look on,
   and thine eye straight before thee.' Let us mind our business, which is
   to go to heaven; whereas by gazing and wandering the heart comes to be
   enchanted with earthly things.

   4. By wandering and letting loose the eye the heart is distracted in
   duty. Distraction in duty is a great and usual evil, and one cause of
   it is the curiosity of the senses. How often do we mingle sulphur with
   our incense, and come to worship God having our hearts to the ends of
   the earth! Men let loose their eyes, and then away go their hearts; and
   therefore, as Solomon saith, Take heed to thy foot when thou enterest
   into the house of God,' Eccles. v. Many come hither merely to see and
   to be seen, and to display their vanity by their vain attire. How many
   are there that let loose their eyes to vanity, when they should give up
   their ears to the counsel of God! Some dress up themselves in such vain
   attire and indecent fashions to draw the eyes of others to gaze upon
   them; this is a great affront to God's worship; Solomon saith, Prov.
   xvii. 24, The fool's eyes are to the ends of the earth.' One cause of
   distraction is the curiosity of the senses; our eyes run to and fro,
   and then our hearts wander and rove from the business we are about. It
   is a strange constancy and fixedness that is spoken of the priests at
   Jerusalem, that when Faustus, Cornelius, and Furius, and Fabius broke
   into the city with their troops, and rushed into the temple ready to
   kill them, yet they went on with the rites of the temple, as if there
   had been no such thing. And strange is that other instance of the
   Spartan youth, that held the censer to Alexander while he offered
   sacrifice. A coal lighting upon his arm, he suffered it to burn there
   rather than by any crying out of his disturb that worship. These
   instances are a shame to Christians, that we do not more fix our hearts
   when we are in the service of God.

   Use 2. The second use is to press us to this piece of mortification,
   even to turn away your eyes from beholding vanity.' To help you in it
   you must--

   1. Take Job's course: Job xxxi. 1, I made a covenant with my eyes,' Job
   and his eyes were in covenant; there was a covenant between heart and
   eyes. Eyes, be you faithful to my soul, that there be nothing that may
   stir up carnal and impure thoughts, that there be no unclean objects
   that may fire my heart. Oh, the fool-hardiness of this age! Some will
   smile at this kind of discipline, to be so strict and precise. Why, is
   sin grown less dangerous, or is man's nature more wise and strong, or
   are we better fortified against temptations? Are our hearts in a better
   posture than the servants of God of old? Surely not; and therefore set
   a watch upon your eyes, that sin break not in upon your heart.

   2. Consider the vanity of the things we dote upon and take in by the
   eyes. So saith David, Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity.' They
   are poor vain perishing things, yet they suit too well with our senses.
   And consider what Solomon saith of these things, Wilt thou set thine
   heart upon that which is not?' We inflame our hearts with these things,
   and lust putteth a lovely face upon the object that suiteth with it;
   but alas! what are they? Whatever they seem to the beholder, it is but
   vanity: Ps. xxxix. 6, Man flattereth himself in a vain show.' All the
   splendour and beauty of it is but vain: 1 Cor. vii. 31, The fashion of
   this world passeth away;' it is but an empty thing, flying bubbles.
   Though the world is of some use to us in our pilgrimage, yet poor
   things they are, as that for them we should neglect our duty to God,
   and grow less lively therein, or have our hearts withdrawn from God. It
   is the temptation that maketh them seem comely. When these alluring
   vanities are before our eyes, lust puts a gloss upon them. But consider
   what they are indeed, and in comparison of those things from which they
   tempt you, namely, heaven and eternal blessedness.

   3. Consider the cursed issue of these things, of letting loose thy eye
   and heart to vanity. When you please the eye you wound the heart, and
   make you unfit for your great account: Eccles. xi. 9, Rejoice, young
   man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy
   youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thine
   eyes: yet know that for all these things God will bring thee to
   judgment.' Go, drench and steep thy soul in carnal delights; when thy
   wandering and wanton eye doth influence the lusts of thy heart, and
   they begin to boil up, when thou hast not denied thyself anything thy
   heart can wish and thine eye look upon, put in a little cool water to
   stop the boiling and raging of thy lust; remember that God will bring
   thee to judgment; though thou dost now smother thy convictions, and
   drown thy reason in these sensual delights, yet God will call thee to
   an account for all thy time, and parts, and strength, and wit, and
   talents intrusted with thee.

   4. Pray, as David doth here, Turn away mine eyes.' He calleth upon God
   for the assistance of his grace; and Ps. cxli. 3, Set a watch upon the
   door of my lips.' He that bendeth and inclineth the heart by his grace
   to look after better things, must also bridle the senses. It is lust
   sets the eye awork, and causeth a deep complacency and delight in
   carnal things, and that is cured only by God's grace, Mark x. 27;
   therefore go and beg this mercy of him.

   5. Constant watchfulness. Alas! we cannot open our eyes but we meet
   with a temptation, a door open for Satan to enter by; therefore we had
   need diligently and constantly to watch, especially when lusts are like
   to be stirred. Lot's wife might not look towards Sodom, but Abraham was
   bidden to look upon it. It was no temptation to him, but it was to her;
   she had her heart hankering after it, Gen. xix. 17, compared with ver.
   28. When we are in danger of a temptation, we should keep a severe and
   strict hand upon the senses, that they may not dwell unnecessarily upon
   alluring objects.

   6. We have renounced the pomps and vanities of the world in baptism,
   and shall our eyes and hearts run after them? This is implied in our
   baptism, for baptism is called the answer of a good conscience towards
   God,' 1 Peter iii. 21. It is an answer to God's demand in the covenant.
   God puts us to the question whether we will renounce the world and the
   vanities and pleasures thereof. Now, when we have renounced these
   things, shall our eyes and our hearts run after them? shall we turn the
   senses against God who gave us the use of them? yea, against our souls?
   To shame you that have been no more faithful to your baptismal vow,
   consider what heathens have done. Basil relateth that Alexander, a
   young man, in the heat of blood and in the flower of his age, refused
   to see Darius's daughter. It is a shame, saith he, for him that hath
   conquered so many men to be conquered by a woman. It is said of some
   heathen that he put out his eyes that they might not be a snare to him.
   We have grace that we may not use such violence to our nature, but
   certainly the eyes of our lusts should be put out; you see our baptism
   engageth us. If heathens, those that never came under such an
   engagement to God, if they by the light of nature saw that the guarding
   of the senses was a help to the soul, it concerns us much more to
   renounce the pomps and vanities of the world.

   Secondly, We come to the request, Quicken thou me in thy way.' By
   quickening is meant the actuation of the spiritual life; he beggeth
   grace to perform his duty to God with cheerfulness, liveliness, and
   zeal.

   Doct. Quickening is very necessary for them that would walk in God's
   ways.

   I shall not consider it here as a prayer to God, or as it is a blessing
   to be asked of God, but as it is necessary to obedience; and here I
   shall inquire--

   1. What quickening is.

   2. Show the necessity of it.

   First, What quickening is. It is put for two things (1.) It is put for
   regeneration or the infusion of grace; (2.) For the renewing the vigour
   of the life of grace, the renewed influence of God, whereby this grace
   is stirred up in our hearts. First, for regeneration or the in fusion
   of grace: Eph. ii. 1, 2, When we were dead in trespasses and sins, yet
   now hath he quickened us.' Then we are quickened or made alive to God
   when we are new born, when there is a habitual principle of grace put
   into our hearts. Secondly, Quickening is put for the renewed excitation
   of grace, when the life that we have received is carried on to some
   further increase; and so it is twofold, either by way of comfort in our
   afflictions, or enlivening in a way of holiness.

   1. Comfort in afflictions; and so it is opposed to fainting, which is
   occasioned by too deep a sense of present troubles, and distrust of God
   and the supplies of his grace. When the affliction is heavy upon us, we
   are like birds dead in the nest, and are so overcome that we have no
   spirit or courage in the service of God: Ps. cxix. 50, This is my
   comfort in affliction, for thy word hath quickened me.' Then we are
   said to be quickened when he raiseth up our hearts above the trouble,
   by refining our suffering graces, as faith, hope, and patience. Thus he
   is said to revive the contrite one,' Isa. lvii. 15; to restore comfort
   to us, and to refresh us with the sense of his love.

   2. There is a quickening in duty, which is opposed to deadness of
   spirit, which is apt to creep upon us, that is occasioned by negligence
   and slothfulness in the business of the spiritual life. Now, to quicken
   us, God exciteth his grace in us. An instrument, though never so well
   in tune, soon grows out of order. A key seldom turned rusts in the
   lock; so graces that are not kept awork lose their exercise and grow
   lukewarm, or else it is occasioned by carnal liberty or intermeddling
   with worldly things. These bring a brawn and deadness upon the heart,
   and the soul is depressed by the cares of this world: Luke xxi. 34,
   Now, when you are under this temper of soul, desire the Lord to quicken
   you by new influences of grace.

   Secondly, Let me show the necessity of this quickening, how needful it
   is.

   1. It is needful, for without it our general standing is questionable,
   whether we belong to God or no: 1 Peter ii. 5, Ye are living stones
   built up into a spiritual house.' It is not enough to be a stone in
   Christ's building, but we must be living stones; not only members of
   his body, but living members. I cannot say such a one hath no grace;
   but when they have it not it renders their condition very questionable;
   a man may be living when he is not lively.

   2. Without it we cannot perform our duties aright. Religion to a dead
   heart is a very irksome thing. When we are dead-hearted we do our
   duties as if we did them not in our general course of obedience. We
   must go to God: Ps. cxix. 88, Quicken me after thy lovingkindness, so
   shall I keep the testimonies of thy mouth.' Then we do good to good
   purpose indeed. It is not enough for us to pray, but we must pray with
   life and vigour: Ps. lxxx. 18, Quicken me, and I will call upon thy
   name.' So we should hear with life, not in a dull, careless fashion,
   Mat. xiii. 15.

   3. All the graces that are planted in us tend to beget quickening; as
   faith, hope, and love; these are the graces that set us awork, and make
   us lively in the exercise of the spiritual life: Faith that works by
   love,' Gal. v. 6. It sets the soul awork by apprehending the sense of
   God's love; whereas otherwise it is but a dead faith, 1 James ii. 16.
   Then for love, what is the influence of that? It constrains the soul,
   it takes the soul along with it, 2 Cor. v. 14, and Rom. xii. 1. And
   then hope; it is called a lively hope,' 1 Peter i. 3. All grace is put
   into us to make us lively; not only the grace of sanctification, but
   the grace of justification is bestowed upon us for this end, that we
   may be cheerful in God's service: Heb. ix. 14, How much more shall the
   blood of Christ purge our consciences from dead works, that we may
   serve the living God?' Sin and guilt make us dead and heavyhearted; but
   now the blood of Christ is sprinkled upon the conscience, and the
   sentence of death taken away, then we are made cheerful to serve the
   living God. Attributes are suited to the case in hand; he is called the
   living God, because he must be served in a living manner.

   4. All the ordinances which God hath appointed are to get and in crease
   this liveliness in us. Wherefore hath God appointed the word? Isa. lv.
   3, Hear and your souls shall live.' It is to promote the life of grace,
   and that we may have new encouragement to go on in the ways of God.
   Moses, when he received the law, is said to receive the lively oracles
   of God,' Acts vii. 38. So the doctrine of Christ; they are all spirit
   and life, and serve to beget life in us. As the redemption of the world
   by Christ, the joys of heaven, the torments of hell, they are all
   quickening truths, and propounded to us to keep us in life and vigour.
   The Lord's Supper, why was that ap pointed? There we come to taste the
   flesh of Christ, who was given for the life of the world, John vi.;
   that we might sensibly exercise our faith upon Christ, that we might be
   more sensible of our obligations to him, that we might be the more
   excited in the diligent pursuit of things to come.

   Use 1. Is reproof. David considereth the dulness and deadness of his
   spirit, which many do not, but go on in a cold track of duties, and
   never regard the frame of their hearts. It is a good sign to observe
   our spiritual temper, and accordingly go to God. Most observe their
   bodies, but very few their souls. If the body be ill at ease or out of
   order, they complain presently; but love waxeth cold, and their zeal
   for God and delight in him is abated, yet they never lay it to heart.

   Use 2. To exhort us to get and keep this lively frame of heart.

   1. Get it, pray for it. Liveliness in obedience doth depend upon God's
   blessing; unless he put life and keep life in our souls, all cometh to
   nothing. Come to God upon the account of his glory: Ps. cxliii. 11,
   Quicken me, O Lord, for thy name's sake; for thy righteousness' sake
   bring my soul out of trouble.' His tender mercies: Ps. cxix. 156, Great
   are thy tender mercies, O Lord; quicken me according to thy judgments.'
   Come to him upon the account of Christ: John x. 10, I am come that they
   might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly;' and John
   vii. 38, He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of
   his belly shall flow rivers of living water.' Every new act of faith
   draweth from Christ some in crease of spiritual life.

   2. Stir up yourselves: Isa. lxiv. 7, There is none that calleth upon
   thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee;' 2 Tim. i. 6,
   Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God
   which is in thee by the putting on of my hands;' Ps. xlii. 5, Why art
   thou cast down, my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? Hope
   thou in God, for I shall yet praise him for the helps of his
   countenance.' We have liveliness enough in all businesses of secular
   concernment. Consider what the business is that we are about. It is
   about our everlasting estate, whether we shall live for ever in heaven
   or hell; and shall we trifle here? You had life in a way of sin;
   worldly men are lively. How dishonourable a thing is it to serve the
   living God with a dead heart? A lukewarm frame is hateful to God: Rev.
   iii. 16, Because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will
   spew thee out of my mouth.' Take heed you do not lose quickening, and
   that--

   [1.] By our corruption, by any heinous sin: Ps. li. 10-12 Create in me
   a clean heart, God, and renew a right spirit within me; cast me not
   away from thy presence, and take not thy Holy Spirit from me: restore
   unto me the joy of thy salvation, and uphold me with thy free Spirit.'
   The spirit is a tender thing. A wound in the body lets out the
   life-blood.

   [2.] By an inordinate liberty in worldly pleasures: 1 Tim. v. 6, But
   she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.' Vain company,
   vain speeches, and the like, these things shun and avoid, but, Heb. x.
   24, Let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good
   works;' let us follow good examples. We grow formal and slight by
   imitation. Others profess religion, and yet are dead-hearted and vain,
   and so are we. The idolaters encouraged one another: Isa. xli. 6, 7,
   They helped every one his neighbour, and every one said to his brother,
   Be of good courage; so the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he
   that smoothed with the hammer him that smote the anvil.' We should
   encourage one another in the way of godliness, and keep up a lively
   frame of heart towards God, and pray with the Psalmist in the text,
   Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity, and quicken thou me in thy
   way.'

SERMON XLIII.

   Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear.--Ver.
   38.

   IN these words observe--

   1. A request, stablish thy word unto thy servant.

   2. A motive to enforce it, who is devoted to thy fear. The motive is
   taken from the qualifications and disposition of the person who makes
   the request.

   In the request you have--

   1. The matter prayed for, stablish thy word.

   2. The person for whom, unto thy servant, that is, unto me who am so.

   I shall begin with the first of these, the benefit asked, Stablish thy
   word.' David, that had prayed before, Stablish me according to thy
   word,' ver. 28, now saith, Stablish thy word unto me.'

   By the word is meant the word of promise. Now the promise of God is
   established when it is confirmed and made good: 2 Cor. xiii. 1, In the
   mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established,' that
   is, accounted valid and firm; and 2 Sam. vii. 25, when he speaks of
   God's promises he prays, Stablish it for ever, and do as thou hast
   said.' Look, as on the one side we are said to establish the law of God
   when we observe it; for so it runs, Deut. xxvii. 26, Cursed be he that
   confirmeth,' or establisheth not all the words of this law to do them.'
   The law is then confirmed when it hath its force and effect upon us;
   whereas otherwise, when they observe it not, it is said to be void.
   That sentence is repeated by the apostle thus: Gal. iii. 10, Cursed is
   every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the
   book of the law to do them.' Well, then, the promise is established
   when it is made good.

   Quest. But why doth David pray thus, Stablish thy word to me,' since
   God's word is most certain and stable in itself, so as it cannot be
   more? 2 Peter i. 19, We have a more sure,' or a more stable word of
   prophecy,' as the word signifies. How can the word be more stable than
   it is?

   Ans. I answer--It is sure in regard of God, from whom it comes, and in
   itself. In regard of the things propounded, it cannot be more or less
   stable, it cannot be fast and loose; but in regard of us, it may be
   more or less established. And that two ways--

   1. By the inward assurance of the Spirit increasing our faith.

   2. By the outward performance of what is promised.

   1. By the inward assurance of the Spirit, by which our faith is
   increased. Great is the weakness of our faith, as appears by our fears,
   doubts, distrusts; so that we need to be assured more and more. We need
   say with tears, as he doth in the Gospel, Mark ix. 24, Lord, I believe;
   help thou mine unbelief,' and to cry out with the apostles, Lord,
   increase our faith,' Luke xvii. 5. There is none believeth so but he
   may yet believe more. And in this sense the word is more established
   when we are confirmed in the belief of it, and look upon it as a sure
   ground for faith to rest upon.

   2. By actual performance, when the promise is made good to us. Every
   event which falls out according to the word is a notable testimony of
   the truth of it, and a seal to confirm and strengthen our faith. Three
   ways may this be made good:

   [1.] The making good of some promises at one time strengthens our faith
   in expecting the like favour at another. Christ was angry with his
   disciples for not remembering the miracle of the loaves, when they fell
   into a like strait again: Mat. xvi. 9, Do ye not yet understand,
   neither remember the five loaves?' &c. We are to seek upon every
   difficulty; whereas former experience in the same kind should be a
   means of establishment to us: 2 Cor. i. 10, He hath delivered, and doth
   deliver; in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us.' In teaching a
   child to spell, we are angry if, when we have showed him a letter once,
   twice, and a third time, yet when he meets with it again still he
   misseth; so God is angry with us when we have had experience of his
   word in this, that, and the other providence, yet still our doubts
   return upon us.

   [2.] The accomplishment of one promise confirms another; for God, that
   keepeth touch at one time, will do so at another: 2 Tim. iv. 17, I was
   delivered out of the mouth of the lion; and the Lord shall deliver me
   from every evil work, and preserve me blameless unto his heavenly
   kingdom.' In such a strait God failed not, and surely he that hath been
   true hitherto will not fail at last.

   [3.] When the word is performed in part, it assureth us of the
   performance of the whole; it is an earnest given us of all the rest: 2
   Cor. i. 10, For all the promises of God in him are Yea, and in him
   Amen.' A Christian hath a great many promises, and they are
   a-performing daily. God is delivering, comforting, protecting him,
   speaking peace to his conscience; but the greater part are yet to be
   performed. Present experiences do assure us of what is to come. Thus,
   stablish thy word,' that is, make it good by the event, that I may
   learn to trust another time, either for the same or other promises, or
   accomplishment of thy whole word.

   Doct. That it is a matter of great consequence to have the word of God
   established to us, or to be confirmed in a certain belief of his
   promises.

   David asketh it here as a very necessary thing, Stablish thy word unto
   thy servant.' Give me, Lord, to look upon it as a stable and firm
   thing. This will appear if you consider the conveniency, necessity,
   utility, and profit of this establishment.

   1. The conveniency and suitableness of it. It is very convenient that
   we should build strongly upon a strong foundation, that sure truths
   shall be entertained with a certain faith, and things taken as they are
   uttered. There is certitudo objecti, a certainty of the object itself;
   and certitudo subjecti, the certainty of the subject, our being
   persuaded of the certainty of it. The one warrants the other, and both
   are necessary to our comfort; that is, as the word is certain in
   itself, so it should be certain to us. No matter how strong the
   foundation be, if the building upon that foundation be weak, down it
   falleth. The word of God is stable in itself, but if we are not
   persuaded it is so, we are soon shaken with temptations. To stay a ship
   from being tossed upon the rocks, it is necessary the anchor-hold be
   good itself, and be fastened upon somewhat that is firm; therefore,
   Heb. vi. 18-20, the apostle speaks first of the stability of the
   ground, and then of the strength of the anchor. There is a firm rocky
   ground to build upon, the immutable promises of God; and a solid strong
   anchor, which is our faith and affiance. As faith without the promises
   is nothing but groundless and fruitless conceit, so the promises yield
   us no comfort without faith. The promises are Yea and Amen in Christ,'
   2 Cor. i. 20; and then presently, Now he which stablisheth us with you
   in Christ is God.' It is not sufficient that the promises be
   established, but we must be established upon them. They are Yea and
   Amen in Christ; but what is that to us? God may lose the glory of his
   truth, and we the comfort, if we be not established.

   2. The necessity of it will appear if we consider--(1.) How natural
   unbelief is to us all; and (2.) How weak the faith of most is.

   [1.] If we consider how natural unbelief is to us; it is a sin we suck
   in with our milk. When our first parents sinned against God, his word
   was not believed, and thereupon the sin was committed, Gen. iii. 4. The
   devil contradicted that which God delivered with his own mouth; his Nay
   prevails above God's Yea. Ye shall not surely die,' that was that which
   let in the first sin, and ever since it is very natural to us: Heb.
   iii. 12, Take heed lest there be an evil heart of unbelief in you, in
   departing from the living God.' Unbelief is the special part of the
   heart's wickedness; partly because we have wronged God, therefore are
   apt to suspect him; for men are always jealous of those whom they have
   wronged, and that they cannot mean well to them from whom they have
   received ill. We have wronged God, and therefore are suspicious of him
   and of his good-will to sinners. And partly because the truths of God
   lie cross to our lusts and carnal interest, which maketh us so ready to
   pick quarrels with him. Ahab would not hear Micaiah, not because he
   prophesied false, but evil: John iii. 20, They will not come to the
   light, lest their deeds should be reproved.' I say, such strict rules,
   such close and quickening truths, as God hath published in the gospel,
   men could wish they were not true; that there were no heaven, nor hell,
   nor world to come; and therefore, because it lies so cross to our
   lusts, our wishes gain upon our understanding and blind us, and we are
   not apt to believe these things. Who will close with that which makes
   against him? Men, that are loath the word of God should prove true, are
   therefore slow of heart to believe it, Luke xxiv. And partly, because
   ever since we were born we have been trained up to live by sense; and
   are affected only with the things we see, hear, and feel; and therefore
   are little skilled in faith, which is the evidence of things not seen,'
   Heb. xi. 1, which carrieth us to things above sense to the concernments
   of another world. In short, then, for these reasons, because it is
   natural to us to live by sense, to indulge our own lusts, and to
   suspect those whom we have wronged, therefore unbelief of God is so
   rife in the world.

   [2.] The necessity of establishment in the word of God will appear if
   we consider how weak the faith of most is. There are few that entertain
   the word as a sure and certain truth. There are several degrees of
   assent; there is conjecture, opinion, weak faith, and faith that is
   stronger, and that which comes up to an assurance of understanding, as
   the apostle calls it. There is conjecture, or a lighter inclination of
   the mind to the word of God, as possibly or probably true; a suspicious
   knowledge of things, or bare guess at them, when we go no higher than
   It may be so, that all this is true which God hath spoken concerning
   Christ and salvation. There is beyond this opinion, when the mind is
   more inclined to think it true, when we are so convinced of the truth
   of it that we are not able reasonably to contradict it; we think it
   true; but there is still a fear of the contrary, that it is not true,
   which prevails over us, and taints our practice, and weakens our
   affections, and withdraws them from things to come. Then beyond this
   there is faith, or a firm and undoubted persuasion of the truth of
   God's word, which also hath its latitude. There is weak faith, which
   hath its incident doubts. And there is beyond this, receiving the word
   in much assurance,' as the expression is, 1 Thes. i. 5. Still we may
   increase higher in the degree of our assent; for in this life there is
   never so much but there may be more, there is not so much faith but
   there may be more. There is something lacking to our faith, and it is
   not easy to grow up to the riches of the full assurance of
   understanding. The best have but a fluctuating doubting knowledge of
   spiritual truths, not a full assurance and persuasion of them.
   Therefore we need to ask establishment.

   3. Consider the utility and profit of it. When once the word is
   established to us, we shall know how to live and how to die, and upon
   what terms to maintain comfort and holiness; whereas otherwise men live
   loosely and carelessly: Heb. iv. 2, The word profited not, not being
   mixed with faith in them that heard it.' Until the word of God be owned
   as a divine and infallible truth, it hath no efficacy upon us. When it
   is received merely by conjecture, as a possible truth, it works but
   weakly. Ay! but then it profits when we receive the word of God as the
   word of God, as a certain truth; when the soul comes to determine,
   Surely these are truths in which I am deeply concerned, upon which my
   eternal life or death doth depend. Without this God can have no
   service, and we no comfort, but are at a great uncertainty of spirit.
   On the other side, let me tell you that all our coldness in duty, and
   ail our boldness in sinning, it comes from unbelief.

   [1.] Our coldness in duty. What is the reason, when God offereth such
   great things to us as the eternal enjoyment of himself, glory, comfort,
   and happiness as much as heart can wish, that men are so dead-hearted,
   lifeless, and careless in the ways of God? when our work is so good,
   our ways so excellent, what is the reason of all our coldness and
   carelessness in the profession of religion? We have not a lively sense
   of eternity; we do not believe God upon his word. If we did, it would
   put life into us. Saith the apostle, Phil. iii. 14, This one thing I
   mind, and I press towards the mark.' Why? For the prize of the high
   calling of God in Jesus Christ.' When we mind our work, seriously and
   above all other things, not superficially and by the by, when we can
   see the prize of our high calling, as to run and hold the eye upon the
   mark, then he presseth onward that he may not lose the garland. So when
   we feel the rewards of grace, when we are persuaded of them, this puts
   spirit into us, and encourageth us against all deadness and faintness.
   Ay! press onward then with a great deal of vehemency and earnestly. So
   1 Cor. xv. 58, Be ye steadfast and unmoveable, always abounding in the
   work of the Lord.' Here is the description of a godly man. How shall we
   do to keep the heart in such an earnest frame? By a sound belief of the
   promises; for so it follows, Forasmuch as you know that your labour
   shall not be in vain in the Lord.' If holiness doth not flourish, there
   is a worm at the root, atheism and unbelief lies at the heart, and the
   want of such an assent to those great and glorious promises which God
   hath made known to us in Christ.

   [2.] Our boldness in sinning. Why do men go on securely in ways of
   disobedience against God? Because they do not know whether the word be
   true, yea or nay. If a man had heaven and hell in his eye, if he were
   soundly persuaded of these things, certainly he would not venture the
   loss of heaven for a trifle; and would not upon such small temptations
   run the hazard of everlasting torments. You cannot drive an ass, the
   most stupid creature, into the fire which is burning before his eyes.
   So if these things were before our eyes we would not be so bold with
   God and so daring as we are. Temptation to sin must needs prevail with
   us when we have not faith; for when the temptation is strong and faith
   weak, where are we? A man will yield to his base lusts; for there is
   present profit, present pleasure, and we have no undoubted certainty of
   the rewards of obedience, and of the promises which are to be set
   against the temptation. But now, when we consider we have so great and
   precious promises, this will make us cleanse ourselves from all
   filthiness of flesh and spirit; we will not easily sin against God,
   kick against the pricks, and run upon danger laid before our eyes: In
   vain is the snare laid in the sight of a bird.'

   Use 1. To reprove us for looking so little after the establishment of
   the word. There are many that content themselves with a loose
   profession of the name of Christ, but are not established in a sound
   belief of the scriptures. Ask them why they are of this and that
   religion. They have been taught so, been brought up in it; and so they
   might have been Mahometans upon the same account that they are
   Christians, if they had been bred there where the name of Mahomet is of
   more request than the name of Christ. But then there are others that
   live by guess, and carry on some natural devotion; but their souls were
   never acquainted with the mystery of grace, never soundly established
   in it; they have a conjecture. There are others that can dispute for
   their religion, that see a reasonableness in the Christian faith, and
   why they should be of this opinion rather than that. Ay! but their
   hearts were never subdued to God. Hath the Spirit established divine
   truths upon thy soul, and wrought these things upon thy heart? hath it
   convinced thy judgment, awakened thy conscience, changed thy heart,
   given thee any taste of God's love in Christ, drawn thee out of the
   world into near and sweet communion with God? Truths are by him
   established to us, and represented with evidence and power, 1 Cor. ii.
   4. Alas! all else we can attain to is but cold and fruitless notion,
   which will not warm the heart; some cursory opinions, that will not
   hold thy heart under the awe of God, and guide thee in the paths of
   holiness to eternal life; and therefore rest not in this, that you have
   some knowledge concerning Christ and privileges by him. But are your
   hearts established? have you a sense of these truths wrought in you by
   the Holy Ghost?

   Use 2. It exhorteth us to use the means whereby the word may be
   established.

   1. Chiefly observe experiences, how it is accomplished in the course of
   God's providence, and inward feeling of thy own heart. What answers of
   prayer have you when you have been wrestling with God and putting his
   promises in suit at the throne of grace? Every day God is fulfilling
   one promise or another, to train us up-to look for more at his hands.
   That we may trust him for our inheritance and our final blessing, he
   first giveth us a proof of his truth in lesser matters. The more you
   observe the dealings of God with your own souls, and the fulfilling his
   word to you, the more will your heart be confirmed against atheism, and
   established in the belief of the divine authority of the scripture. It
   concerns us much to look to this, that our hearts be firmly settled
   against atheism, especially when such errors are abroad, and divisions
   in the church, and the name of God is blasphemed. Now, by these daily
   mercies doth God stablish his word, make it good to your souls: Ps.
   xviii. 30, The word of the Lord is a tried word.' There is more than
   letters and syllables; God standeth to it, it is a tried word.' When
   you have challenged him you have found the scripture fulfilled upon
   appeals to God and applications to the throne of grace. When you have
   been pleading with God; Lord, is not this thy handwriting, the promises
   thou hast made to thy people? the Lord hath answered this from heaven,
   and said, Yea, this is my promise. He hath given in an answerable
   promise.

   2. It engageth you to dependence and assurance of faith: Ps. ix. 10,
   They that know thy name will put their trust in thee; for thou, Lord,
   hast not forsaken them that seek thee.' Whosoever hath observed God's
   dealings will see God is to be trusted, he may be depended upon if he
   hath said anything in his word--they that know thy name,' they that
   have acquainted themselves with God and the course of his
   dispensations. The promises will not lie by as a dead stock: Ps. cxvi.
   1, 2, God hath heard my voice and my supplications, therefore will I
   call upon him as long as I live.' This is that which will quicken you
   to rejoice in God and to a holy thankfulness, when you compare his word
   with the effects of it, when you see how it is made good: Ps. lvi. 10,
   In God will I praise his word; in the Lord will I praise his word.' A
   single mercy is not so much, nor so engaging upon our hearts to
   thankfulness, as when observing the mercy hath been the fruit of a
   promise. This hath been the practice of God's saints; Joshua takes
   notice of it: Josh. xxiii. 14, Not one thing hath failed of all the
   good things which the Lord your God spake concerning yon;' 1 Kings
   viii. 56, There hath not failed one word of all his good promises,
   which he hath promised by the hand of Moses his servant.' You will
   often find the very letter of the promise made good in the course of
   God's dealings, and if you would but observe his daily providence, you
   would be trained up in more waiting upon God for your final blessings.

   Secondly, Let us come to the person for whom he prays, Stablish thy
   word;' but to whom? To thy servant.' Here note

   Doct. That particular application of general promises is necessary.

   This word which he would have to be established was most likely to be a
   promise of sanctification; for in the former verse he had prayed for
   mortification and vivification, and now for sanctification. But be it
   any other promise, certainly that word which was made to others was
   likewise made to me, as if he had been specified therein by name. Thus
   must general truths be taken home by particular application, that they
   may lie the closer to our hearts. Ps. xxvii. 8, the offer of God's
   favour is general, Seek ye my face;' but the application is particular
   to himself, Lord, I will seek thy face;' David takes it as spoken to
   him in particular. So Ps. cxvi. 15, f Precious in the sight of the Lord
   is the death of his saints;' and then, Truly, Lord, I am thy servant,
   and the son of thy handmaid.' The comfort concerned all God's children.
   The life and death of the saints is very precious in the eyes of God;
   he hath a particular care over them, and tells all their bones. Now,
   Lord, saith David, let me have the comfort of this promise; I am thy
   servant. So 1 Tim. i. 15, This is a faithful saying,' &c., whereof I am
   chief.' This holy art should we learn of creeping under the covert of a
   promise, and working ourselves by faith into the comfort of it.

   But rather, secondly, you may observe the character that he puts upon
   himself, Thy servant. David was a king, but at the throne of grace he
   styles himself God's servant, the fittest title that he could use when
   he prays for grace.' Hence note--

   Doct. He that is a servant of God may seek and expect grace from him.

   Here I shall show--

   1. Who is God's servant.

   2. Why we must use this plea when we come to have promises
   accomplished.

   1. Who is God's servant? I answer--He that dedicates himself to God's
   use, and he that lives under a sense and conscience of his dedication.

   [1.] He that dedicates himself to God's use. We are God's servants by
   covenant and voluntary contract. It is true our service is due to him
   upon other accounts, but we enter into it by contract. It is due by
   virtue of creation, for he made us out of nothing; therefore we owe him
   all that we have, and thus all creatures were made for God's service:
   Ps. cxix. 91, They continue this day according to thine ordinances; for
   all are thy servants.' Heaven and earth, and sun and moon, and stars,
   and beasts, and every creeping thing, and every plant and herb, they
   all serve God according to the ends for which they were made. But
   especially men and angels; they were made for God's use immediately.
   Other things were made ultimately and terminately for God; man
   immediately for God, Ps. ciii. 21. The angels are his ministers, and so
   is man God's servant. And then by the right of redemption; we are bound
   to serve him as the captive was to serve the buyer; he that bought
   another out of slavery, all his time and strength belonged to him: 1
   Cor. vi. 20, Ye are bought with a price, therefore glorify God with
   your souls and bodies.' But this shows only de jure what we ought to
   be; we ought all to be God's servants, as he created us, and redeemed
   us by the blood of Christ. But de facto none are his servants but those
   who resign and yield up themselves to his use: Rom. vi. 13, Yield up
   yourselves to the Lord.' God will have his right and title confirmed by
   our consent, and therefore he that is a servant of God one time or
   other hath entered into covenant with God, he hath consented to yield
   up himself to walk with God in a strict obedience. All that thus yield
   up themselves to be God's servants they do it with shame; they are
   ashamed they did no sooner think of their creator, in their youth, at
   their first coming to the use of reason, and think of him that bought
   them by his blood: 1 Peter iv. 3, For the time past of our lives may
   suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles,' &c. They have too
   long dishonoured God, destroyed their own souls, and kept their creator
   out of his right. And they do it too with a sense of God's love, in the
   new title he hath by redemption: 2 Cor. v. 14, 15, For the love of
   Christ constrains us,' &c.

   [2.] He is one liveth under a sense and conscience of his dedication,
   not as his own, but God's. When you have given up yourselves to God's
   service, you must not walk as you list, but as your master pleaseth.
   Aristotle makes it the property of a servant to be one that can not
   live as he would, that hath no will of his own, but hath given up
   himself to be commanded and directed by another, and sometimes contrary
   to his own inclination. They are rebels and not servants that said Our
   tongues are our own,' Ps. xii. 3. Your tongues are not your own to
   speak what you please, nor your hearts your own to think what you
   please, nor your hands your own to do what you please. You are God's
   servants, therefore must be wholly at his will. The angels, that are
   God's ministers, when they are described, they do his pleasure,' Ps.
   ciii. 21. So your business is to do the will of God; not to please
   yourself, men or the flesh, but to please God, to do the will of God,
   without any respect to your own inclinations and worldly interests; and
   therefore your hearts will rise against sin upon this account, when you
   are tempted to do anything that is contrary to the will of God: Oh! I
   am not my own; these members are Christ's. You look upon every thing as
   God's, to be employed to his service.

   2. Those that would have the word to be established, why must they be
   servants of the Lord?

   [1.] God doth not look to the work, but to the qualification of the
   person. God will not accept a man for one good work, one prayer; but he
   looks to the qualification of his person. The prayer of the wicked is
   an abomination to the Lord,' Prov. xxviii. 9. How is that? Not only
   when it is managed in a careless fashion, when a wicked man prays
   wickedly. No; let him do his best; for it is said, Prov. xxi. 27, The
   sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination; how much more when he
   bringeth it with a wicked mind?' At best it is an abomination; God will
   not accept of a sacrifice at his hands; and therefore the qualification
   of the person is to be regarded when we pray for a blessing promised,
   James v. 16. There is the qualification of the prayer; it must be
   fervent, effectual;' a prayer driven with life and motion, that hath
   spirit and life. Ay! but it must be of a righteous person.' As
   naturalists speak of a jewel which, if put into a dead man's mouth,
   loseth all its virtue and efficacy, so prayer in the mouth of a wicked
   carnal man loseth its efficacy with God. When one that had revolted
   from the Romans sent gifts to the Roman general, he made him this
   answer, He should first return to his obedience to the state of Rome.
   So God saith to wicked men, first let them be God's servants, and then
   they shall have the blessing of his promises.

   [2] It is agreeable to the covenant, for the covenant is mutual: I will
   be your God, and you shall be my people.' All promises relate to a
   covenant. Now, in every covenant there is ratio dati et
   accepti--something required as well as something given, for it binds
   mutually; therefore if we would have God give us grace, we must yield
   obedience. Precepts and promises go hand in hand; and therefore they
   that would have promises performed, they must observe precepts, and
   mingle resolutions of duty with expectations of mercy. That is the
   covenant way of dealing with God; there must be a sincere purpose and
   endeavour to serve God. I am thy servant, therefore stablish thy word
   to me.

   Use. To press you to become God's servants. I might bring motives both
   from the time past, present, and to come. (1.) From the time past. You
   are obliged to be so. You are his creatures; you have life, being, and
   all things from him. We cannot receive a small kindness from man but it
   doth produce respect; I am your servant. Shall a kindness from God less
   effect us, who made us, and gives us life, breath, and all things? We
   take no notice of w r hat comes from an invisible hand. Here is the
   wonder, that the great God, who hath no need of us, so often provoked
   by us, that is of such excellent majesty, so far above us, should take
   notice of us. Therefore, if God made us, keeps us, and maintains us
   from day to day, and abaseth himself to behold us, to look after us,
   this should engage us. (2.) And then from what is present. The honour
   that is put upon you; it is a great advancement to be God's servant.
   The meanest offices about princes are accounted honourable. Jesus
   Christ himself as mediator he hath this title put upon him, My
   righteous servant,' Isa. liii. 11; and the angels they are your
   fellow-servants, Ps. ciii. 21; they are called ministers of God.'
   Likewise for the present you have free access to God: God's servants
   may stand in his presence, and they have liberty to ask anything they
   need of. The Queen of Sheba said concerning Solomon in 1 Kings x. 8,
   Happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee and
   hear thy wisdom.' Much more may it be said concerning God's servants,
   blessed are those that stand in. his presence, that have such free
   leave to hold communion with God; to come, and have assurance of
   welcome whenever they come. (3.) And for the time to come. God's
   service will issue itself into everlasting blessedness; God's servants
   have excellent wages: John xii. 26, If any man serve me, he shall be
   there where I am, and my Father will honour him.' Christ and his Father
   will study what honour they can put upon him. Therefore be God's
   servants that you may please him for the present, and comfortably wait
   for his everlasting blessing. Thus I have gone over the first thing,
   namely the request, Stablish thy word unto thy servant.'

   Secondly, The motive and argument, Who is devoted to thy fear.' The
   word may be rendered either which, or who, as relating either to thy
   word or thy servant.

   1. Thy word; for in the original Hebrew the posture of the verse is
   thus, Stablish to thy servant thy word, which is to the fearing of
   thee;' that is, given that thou mayest be feared, there being in the
   word of God the greatest arguments and inducements to fear and
   reverence and obey him. The word of God was appointed to this use, to
   plant the fear of God in our hearts, and to increase our reverence of
   God. Not that we may play the wanton with promises, and feed our lusts
   with them. I rather take our own translation as more accommodate, and
   it hath such a sense as that, Ps. cix. 4, But I give myself unto
   prayer.' In the original it is, But I prayer;' and Stablish thy word to
   thy servant, who is to thy fear.' Our translators add, to make the
   sense more full, addicted,' devoted to thy fear,' that is, that makes
   it his business, care, and desire to stand in the fear of God.

   2. Now this is added as a true note and description of God's servants,
   as being a main thing in religion: Ps. cxi. 10, The fear of the Lord is
   the beginning of wisdom,' the first in point of order, and it is the
   first thing when we begin to be wise, to think of God, to have awful
   thoughts of God; it is a chief point of wisdom, the great thing that
   makes us wise to salvation. And it is added as an argument of prayer:
   Neh. i. 11, O Lord, let thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy
   servants, who desire to fear thy name.' The more any is given to the
   fear of God, the more assurance they have of God's love, and readiness
   to hear them at the throne of grace. The point is this--

   Doct. That man is indeed God's servant who is devoted to his fear.
   There may be weaknesses and failings, but for the main he is swayed by
   the fear of God.

   1. What it is to fear God.

   2. Why this is a sure note of God's servant, because it removes all the
   lets of obedience.

   1. What it is to fear God. There is a servile and a filial fear; a fear
   of wrath, which the worst may have: James ii. 19, The devils believe
   and tremble;' and a fear of offending, which the best must have: Prov.
   xxviii. 14, Blessed is he that feareth alway;' a reverent disposition
   of heart towards God as our sovereign lord and master, yea, as our
   father in Jesus Christ.

   For the first of these:--

   [1.] A fear of wrath. Every fear of wrath is not sinful; it is a duty
   rather than a sin. All God's children are bound to have a tender sense
   of God's wrath or displeasure against sin, to make them awful and
   serious in the spiritual life; as in Heb. xii. 27, Let us serve God
   with reverence and godly fear.' Mark, upon that account and
   consideration, as he is a consuming fire;' that should have an
   influence upon our godly fear; and Mat. x. 28, Fear not them that can
   but kill the body, but rather fear him which is able to destroy both
   body and soul in hell.' The words do not only contain a description of
   the person who ought to be feared, but the ground and reason why he is
   to be feared; and therefore it is not simply the fear of wrath that is
   sinful, but it is the servility and slavishness of it. Now, what is the
   servility and slavishness of the fear of wrath? Partly when our own
   smart and terror is feared more than the displeasing of God; and they
   have a mind to sin but are afraid of hell; and it is fear accompanied
   with hatred. Servile fear, though it keep us from some sins, as a wolf
   may be scared from the prey, yet keeps its devouring nature. It is
   accompanied with hatred of God: all that fear God they hate him; and
   indeed they could wish there were no God, none to call them to account;
   they could wish he were not so just and holy as he is. And so here lies
   the evil of it, not so much fear of wrath, for that is a grace rightly
   conversant about its object, but as it tends to this hatred of God. And
   partly too servility lies in this, as it makes us shy of God, and run
   away from him rather than draw near to him, as Adam ran into the bushes
   to hide himself. Holy fear is an awe of God upon the soul, but that
   keeps us in a holy communion with him: I will put my fear into their
   hearts, and they shall not depart from me;' but that fear which makes
   us fly from God is slavish. And partly as it hath torment and
   perplexity in it, and so hindereth us in God's service: Fear hath
   torment in it.' The fear of wrath, that is a duty; but slavish fear is
   such a fear of wrath which makes us hate God and shun his presence, and
   afraid more of wronging ourselves than wronging of God; and such a fear
   that hath torment and perplexity in it, that cannot serve God so
   cheerfully.

   [2.] There is a filial fear, a fear of reverence. This fear of God was
   in Christ as mediator, Isa. xi. 1, 2. Among other graces there reckoned
   up which do belong to Jehovah the branch,' to Christ Jesus, this is
   one, The fear of the Lord.' Christ as man had a reverent affection to
   his Father whom he served, and this fear it continueth to all eternity
   in the blessed spirits that are in heaven. The saints and angels have
   this kind of fear, a dread of the holy God, and a reverent and awful
   respect to his majesty. It is an essential respect which passeth
   between the creature and the creator, and can never be abolished. Now,
   this fear of reverence consisteth in a high esteem of God, of his
   majesty, glory, power, and in the sense and continual thoughts of his
   presence; and then a loathness to sin against God, or to offend in his
   sight, to do anything that is unseemly when God is a looker-on. What!
   can a man sin freely that lives in the sight of the holy God, when he
   hath a deep sense of his excellency imprinted on his heart? This is
   that fear which is the note of God's servants.

   2. This must needs be the note of God's servants, because it is the
   great principle that both hindereth us from sin and quickeneth us to
   duty. The fear of God is one of the radical and essential graces which
   belong to a Christian; it is a mighty restraint from sin. The beasts
   were made to serve man, and how are they held in subjection and
   obedience to man? The dread of you,' saith God, shall be upon every
   beast of the earth,' Gen. ix. 2. So we are made for the service of God.
   Now, how are we kept in subjection to God? When the fear of God is upon
   our heart, that will not suffer us freely to do any thing that is
   displeasing to God: Exod. xx. 20, God is come to prove you, that his
   fear may be before your faces, that you sin not.' It is a great remedy
   against all temptation of gain, and worldly profit, and temporal
   convenience. Look, as that man that had a fear of the king upon his
   heart: 2 Sam. xviii. 12, Why didst thou not smite him to the ground?'
   saith Joab; and the man answered, Though I should receive a thousand
   shekels, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son;'
   just such a fear hath a child of God of his heavenly king: No; though I
   should have never so much offered me to tempt me from my duty; no, I
   dare not, the Lord hath charged me to the contrary. Or, as when the
   Rechabites were tempted to drink wine, pots were brought before them to
   inflame their appetite: No; we dare not. These passages express the
   workings of heart in one that fears God; though temptation be present,
   and never so much convenience thereby, yet how can they do this
   wickedness and sin against God?

   Use. It informeth us who are God's servants; those that have most of
   this fear of God planted in their hearts: Neh. vii. 2, He was a
   faithful man, and feared God above many.' And then that they express it
   in their conversation. God will not take it planted in our hearts, if
   we do not obey him in those things that are contrary to our interests
   and natural affections. When God tried Abraham that was to offer his
   Isaac, Gen. xxii., Now I know that thou fearest me, since thou hast not
   withheld thine only son,' &c. Why? was Abraham un known to God before
   that time? As Peter told Christ, Lord, thou knowest all things.' Cannot
   God see the inward springs and motions of our souls, and what
   affections are there? Could not God tell what was in Abraham? But now,
   I acknowledge. For God will not acknowledge it in this sense until we
   express it. They are the true servants of God that have his fear
   planted in their hearts, and express it upon all occasions.

SERMON XLIV.

   Turn away my reproach which I fear; for thy judgments are good.--Ver.
   39.

   IN these words you have--

   1. A request, take away my reproach.

   2. A reason to enforce it, for thy judgments are good.

   First, For the request, Turn away,' roll from upon me; so it signifies.
   He was clothed with reproach; now roll from me my reproach. Some think
   he means God's condemnatory sentence, which would turn to his reproach,
   or some remarkable rebuke from God because of his sin. Rather, I think,
   the calumnies of his enemies; and he calls it my reproach,' either as
   deserved by himself, or as personally lighted upon him, the reproach
   which was like to be his lot and portion in the world through the
   malice of his enemies: The reproach which I fear,' that is, which I
   have cause to expect, and am sensible of the sad consequences of.

   Secondly, For the reason by which this is enforced, For thy judgments
   are good.' There are different opinions about the formality of this
   argument. Some take the reason thus: Let me not suffer reproach for
   adhering to thy word, thy word which is so good. But David doth not
   speak here of suffering reproach for righteousness' sake, but such
   reproach as was likely to befall him because of his own infirmities and
   failings. Reproaches for righteousness' sake are to be rejoiced in. But
   he saith, This I fear;' and therefore I suppose this doth not hit the
   reason, neither the other sense, Why should I be looked upon as an
   evil-doer as long as I keep thy law and observe thy statutes? others
   judge badly of me, but I appeal to thy good judgment. Others, by
   judgments, understand God's dealings: Thou dost not deal with men
   according to their desert; thy dispensations are kind and gracious.
   Rather thus: by judgments are meant the ways, statutes, and ordinances
   of God, called judgments, because all our words, works, thoughts, are
   to be judged according to the sentence of the word. Now these, it is
   pity they should suffer in my reproach and Ignominy; this is that I
   fear more than anything else that can happen to me. I think the reason
   will better run thus: Lord, there is in thy law, word, covenant, many
   promises to encourage thy people, and therefore rules to provide for
   the due honour and credit of thy people. Take it so.

   I shall, with respect to the necessities of the people of God, insist a
   little upon the former clause, and observe this point:--

   That reproaches are a usual, but yet a great and grievous, affliction
   to the children of God. They are usual, for David saith, my reproach.'
   Even this holy man could not escape the censures of his enemies; and
   they are grievous, for he saith, which I fear.'

   First, That they are usual. David often complains of it in this psalm,
   and mentions it as one great evil to God, ver. 22, Remove from me
   reproach and contempt, for I have kept thy testimonies;' and again,
   ver. 42, So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me,
   for I trust in thy word;' and ver. 69, The proud have forged a lie
   against me.' God may let loose a barking Shimei upon a holy David, and
   therefore doth he so often complain of reproaches. So elsewhere: Ps.
   xxxi. 13, For I have heard the slander of many.' Sundry sorts of
   persons made him their butt, upon which they spent and let fly the
   arrows of censure and reproach: Ps. xxxv. 15, The objects gathered
   themselves together against me, they did tear me, and ceased not.' Tear
   me, meaning in his name; that was rent and torn pieces with their
   reproaches; the abjects gathered themselves, &c. Base dust will many
   times be flying in the faces of the children of God; and Jeremiah tells
   us, I have heard the defaming of many;' and Job and other servants of
   God, yea, our Lord himself was reviled; he endured the contradiction of
   sinners,' many a bitter reproach, even of the highest crimes against
   either table. There were objected to him blasphemy and sedition, the
   highest crime against the first, and the highest crime against the
   second table. The Son of God, that was so meek, innocent, just, and did
   so much good in every place, yet he met with odious aspersions;
   therefore we cannot say that they are faulty because they are aspersed,
   since this hath been the portion of the most eminent godly persons. And
   after that we are told, Ps. lxiv. 3, 4, They whet their tongue like a
   sword, and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words,
   that they may shoot in secret at the perfect.' Perfection meets with
   envy, and envy vents itself by detraction; and when men cannot reach
   the height of others by a holy imitation, then by odious imputations
   they seek to make them as vile, low, and base as themselves. Thus it is
   a usual affliction.

   Secondly, It is a grievous affliction; for the man of God, that was
   after God's own heart, he saith, The reproach which I so feared.' It is
   called persecution, Gal. iv. 29; compare with Gen. xxi. 9, and you
   shall see it was mocking and reproach. The scourge of the tongue is one
   of the basest persecutions that the children of God are tried withal;
   and they are called cruel mockings,' Heb. xi. 36. There is as much
   cruelty and as deep a wound many times made by the tongue of reproach
   as by the fist of wickedness.

   To confirm it by reasons. Reproach must needs be grievous, because it
   is against nature, and against grace.

   1. It is against nature. Contempt is a heavy thing to bear, and as
   honour is more grateful to some persons, so reproach is more grievous
   than many ordinary crosses. Many would lose their goods cheerfully, yet
   are grieved with the loss of their names. According to the constitution
   and frame of men's spirits so they are affected, some with shame more
   than with fear. There seems to be excellency and gallantry in
   sufferings which are honourable, and many can bear that; but the best
   spirits are deeply affected with shame, and disgraceful punishment is
   more dreadful than a painful one. Jesus Christ, that had all the
   innocent affections of human nature, and upon occasion showed them, he
   took notice of mockings and reproaches: Ps. xxii. 7, All they that see
   me laugh me to scorn; they shoot out the lip, they shake the head.' A
   good name is more precious to some than life; and possibly that may be
   the reason why these two are coupled together, Eccles. vii. 1, A good
   name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the
   day of one's birth.' The coupling of these two sentences together seems
   to intimate this, that men had rather die than lose their names. If a
   man die, his memory may be fragrant, he may leave his name behind him;
   but it is more hateful to have their names and credit mangled than
   their flesh with sharp swords. Now it is grievous to nature; there is
   somewhat of corruption in it. Now God knows how to strike in the right
   vein. The godly are not so mortified to their credit in the world many
   times, when they are mortified to other interests. And therefore God
   would try them in this way, and exercise them, that he may humble them,
   and fit them more for his own use. All that I have spoken is but to
   show it is a thing grievous to nature.

   2. It must needs be grievous because grace concurs; as the flood was
   the more violent, and did overspread the world, when not only the mouth
   of the great deep was opened below, but the windows of heaven above;
   then the floods did swell, and overspread the whole world. I bring it
   to this purpose; when the windows of heaven are opened above, when
   grace looks upon it as an affliction as well as nature, then the
   afflictions must needs be the more grievous. Now certainly grace
   concurs to the sense of our affliction, for next to a good conscience
   there is not a greater blessing than a good name holily got. You may
   observe, usually he that is prodigal of his credit certainly will not
   be very tender of his conscience. Grace teacheth us to value a good
   name, partly because it is God's gift, a blessing adopted and taken
   into the covenant, as other such like blessings are. Promises are
   frequent, especially in the Old Testament, where heaven is sparingly
   mentioned. A good name is promised as the reward of the righteous, and
   the name of the wicked shall rot;' it is threatened as a punishment of
   the wicked; for a good name is a shadow of eternity. When a man dies,
   his name he leaves behind him, which is a pledge of our living after
   death. Therefore the Old Testament abounds with promises of this kind:
   he leaves a good name behind him, as spices when broken and dissolved
   leave an excellent scent. And partly too because grace gives us a right
   judgment of all things. Now, it is represented in scripture as better
   than riches, Prov. xxii. 1. It is better, as in other respects, so in
   this; it is a motive more pure and sublime than wealth, and in the
   operations of it it comes next to grace. A dreggy soul is for that
   which is more base, but grace teacheth us to value things. So Eccles.
   vii. 1, A good name is better than precious ointment.' Aromatical
   ointments are things of great use and esteem among the Jews; they are
   counted a chief part of their treasures: and so a good name is better
   than precious ointment; that is, it is better than other riches, for
   this was a great part of their riches. And partly too another reason
   why grace teacheth us to prize it, be cause of the great inconveniences
   which attend the loss of a good name, and the misrepresentation of the
   people of God to the world. The glory of God is much interested in the
   credit of his servants. When they pollute and shame themselves, the
   Lord is polluted in them: Ezek. xiii. 19, Will they pollute me among my
   people;' and Jer. xxxiv. 16, Ye have polluted my name.' Christ, that
   will here after be admired in his saints, will now be glorified in
   them. The shame of our miscarriages, real or supposed, redounds to God
   and religion itself. And therefore, when people are possessed and
   filled with prejudices against religious persons, they are possessed
   and filled with prejudices against the will of God and the
   unquestionable interests of Christ Jesus; and the world, that hates
   God, Christ, and religion, will presently say, These are your
   professors, and this is your profession! Therefore, since the credit of
   religion lieth much in it, grace teacheth us to value it. Besides, too,
   their safety lies in it; for by defaming the worshippers of Christ they
   make way for greater persecutions; and Satan is Usually first a liar,
   and then a murderer, John viii. 44; and when their slanders abound,
   troubles will not long be kept out. As heretofore they invested the
   primitive Christians with bears' skins, and then baited them as bears,
   so they represent them to the world as a vile and infamous sort of men,
   and then the persecution is the better countenanced. First they smite
   with the tongue, and then with the fist of wickedness; and therefore
   their safety lies very much in this. And as their safety, so grace
   teacheth us to value it upon other accounts--their usefulness. Nature
   desires a good name, but it is for their own conveniences. But the
   children of God, if they desire a good name, it is to honour God; and
   that is the difference between vainglory or a desire of the good
   opinion of others. If it terminate in self-respects, it is vainglory;
   but if the heart be pure and right in order to God, then it comes from
   grace. A blemished instrument will be of little use. Most would refuse
   to take their meat from a leprous hand. It is Satan's policy, when he
   cannot discourage instruments from the work of God, then he seeks to
   blemish them and blast them. The apostle tells us that those which are
   called to public office, they should be very careful of their credit,
   that they may promote their work; for he puts down this as one of their
   qualifications: 1 Tim. iii. 7, He must have a good report of them that
   are without, lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.'
   Interpreters differ a little how diabo'los, which we translate devil,
   is to be interpreted. Either it signifies devil or slanderer; both
   senses are good; lest he fall into the snare of the devil, or the snare
   of the slanderer. The devil hath his spies that watch over us, and they
   have set their snares, and watch for your halting, that so the service
   may be blemished, and the gospel obstructed and hindered. Well, then,
   grace prizeth a good name because of the consequences, and because the
   Lord's honour and our safety and service are concerned in it.

   Use 1. First, Here is advice to the person reproached. O Christians!
   acknowledge God in the affliction, if this be your lot and portion.
   David goes to God to stop it there; it is best stopped with God: Turn
   away my reproach.' It is a great and grievous affliction, but in all
   things God hath an aim. Look, what is said of afflictions in general
   may be applied to this particular of reproaches. Now what is God's aim
   and end in afflictions? In general, to try, purge, and make white,'
   Dan. xi. 35; or, as it is Deut. viii. 16, To humble thee, and prove
   thee, and do thee good at the latter end.' Let us take that method;
   here is God's end:--

   First, To humble thee. Carnal men may shoot at rovers, but many times
   we find ourselves pricked at heart. Slanders may revive the sense of
   guilt. They may intend harm, but you should receive good by this as by
   every affliction. Plutarch, in his excellent treatise of profiting by a
   man's enemies, illustrates it by this comparison of Jason, who had an
   imposthume let out by the dart of his enemy. They may fling darts at
   random, and intend harm, but you shall get good by it. Surely there is
   some special cause when the Lord permits this, when volleys of
   reproaches shall follow one after another j therefore he suffers others
   to judge you, to awaken you to self-judging. Mind this, and you will be
   no losers by reproaches. Well, enter into your own hearts, search them
   thoroughly; see what it is God aims at, whether there be any way of
   wickedness in you that hitherto you have not discovered; and when you
   come to see this sink of sin, then your enemies do but help to humble
   you. Many times the voice of a slanderer may do that which the voice of
   a preacher cannot do. And the truth is, there is such a wantonness,
   such a presumptuous headiness in the professors of religion, that the
   word cannot reclaim them, they are so radicated in certain sins; and
   therefore God will follow you with sharp reproaches of his enemies, and
   doth at this time, to call you to a more serious judging yourselves, to
   see your factious headiness, which certainly doth predominate among
   God's professing people.

   There are many sins to which this sharp kind of affliction is proper,
   and therefore God gives out this grievous dispensation to lay open his
   people to bitter reproaches and slanders. I will tell you some of the
   sins. My business is not now to state what is the great sin that God is
   judging among his people, but to help every one in particular to look
   to ourselves, for that I do not conceive to be so fit to be spoken
   here.

   1. Pride. There is a twofold pride--pride in mind, which is called
   self-conceit, and pride in affections, which is called vainglory. Now
   there is no such effectual cure as reproaches for either of these.

   [1.] To speak of the pride in mind, self-conceit. We are very apt to be
   puffed up for our doing and suffering for God poor empty bladders are
   soon puffed up--and think ourselves somebody, if there be but a little
   self-denial; as Peter said, Master, we have left all and followed
   thee.' He was conceited of what he had left for Christ. What had he
   left? A net, a fisher-boat; it was a great all indeed! Mat. xix. 27. We
   are easily puffed up if we suffer a little for God, and the Lord
   intrencheth us in our worldly conveniences, for self-conceit may grow
   out of self-denial. Too often we find it so. Pride is a sin that grows
   out of mortification of other sins; it lives in us while we live in the
   body; therefore, 1 John ii. 16, it is called pride of life.' And some
   compare it to a shirt; that garment is last put off. It is the most
   inward and nearest to the soul, and out of the conquest of other sins
   there ariseth pride. Now, if we have been too self-conceited, the Lord
   will humble us, either by permitting us to fall into such scandals as
   may remember us of our frailty, and what unworthy weak creatures we are
   in ourselves; sometimes by taking off the restraints of his grace and
   of his Spirit, and permitting us to fall. Austin is bold in saying it
   is profitable for proud men to fall some times into open sin, that they
   may know and understand themselves. He speaks it upon the occasion of
   Peter, when he was boasting of his own strength, Though all men leave
   thee, yet will not I.' How foully did he fall! Ay! but at other times
   God useth a more merciful dispensation, for he doth not let his people
   fall into those grievous falls but upon great provocation. But usually
   at other times he lets loose the tongues of virulent men to lessen us
   in our own opinion and in the opinion of the world. Now, how innocent
   soever we be of the crimes charged upon us, yet in all these cases we
   must look upward and inward. Upward; this is not without God; he is at
   the end of causes; he could blast these tongues, and stay and stop them
   at his pleasure; the Lord can keep us from the strife of tongues,' Ps.
   xxxi. 20. But now, when he permits this, his hand must be owned; look
   upward: Micah vii. 9, I will bear the indignation of the Lord, be cause
   I have sinned against him.' At such a time God spits in the faces of
   his people, and puts us to shame; and therefore we should look upward
   and see the hand of God in all this. And look inward; there you will
   see such a sink of sin as deserves this and much more; and therefore a
   sense of our sinfulness in other things should make us more submissive
   to the Lord's correcting hand. We must see the hand of God; for if we
   do not look to that we will be drawn to sin, into reviling for
   reviling, and exasperation for exasperation. Many times our graces do
   us as much hurt as our sins. Self-conceit the Lord will mortify one way
   or other.

   [2.] For vainglory, the other sort of pride, valuing esteem too much,
   our credit in the world, and pleasing ourselves in the opinion others
   have of us. We would usurp God's throne and reign in the hearts of men,
   therefore we are so touchy. Having set a high value upon ourselves, we
   are troubled when others will not come up to our price. Pride is one of
   the oldest enemies that ever God had; it was born in heaven in the
   breasts of the fallen angels, but God tumbled them presently out of
   heaven, as soon as pride got into the heart. Now, when his children
   harbour it, the Lord hath a quarrel with them; and therefore, for
   giving entertainment to pride, he will lay us low enough: 2 Cor. xii.
   7, Lest I should be exalted above measure, there was given to me a
   thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me.' There is a
   great deal of do what this thorn in the flesh is. Some will have it to
   be some trouble or sickness. Most probably so, but it takes in many
   afflictive evils; for, ver. 10, he mentioneth reproaches. Paul was too
   apt to be proud. The Lord made him an eminent instrument; by his faith
   he had abundance of revelations. But God will prick the bladder; he
   doth it with thorns; and he calls it his infirmity, necessity,
   reproach. Infirmity, by that I mean some reigning sickness. But
   reproach was one ingredient. Now, lest we should fee puffed up by vain
   conceit, the Lord humbles us with infirmities, necessities, reproaches.

   2. Another sin for which God humbles us is careless walking. When we
   are negligent, and do not take notice of the carnality that grows upon
   us, and the fleshly frame and temper of heart which breaks out into our
   lives, the Lord suffers others to reproach; then they gather up our
   filth, that we may see what cause we have to take our ways to heart.
   Every man that would live strictly had need either of faithful friends
   or watchful enemies; either faithful friends to admonish him, or
   watchful enemies to censure him; they show us the spots in our garments
   that are to be washed off. Many times a friend is blinded with love,
   and grows as partial to us as we are to ourselves, will suffer sin upon
   us and not tell us of it; then the Lord sets spies upon us to watch for
   our halting, Jer. xx. 10; and therefore we need go to God and pray: Ps.
   xxvii. 11, Lord, lead me in a plain path because of my observers.' They
   lie in wait and seek to take us tripping in aught they can. We can no
   more be without watchful enemies than without faithful friends. How
   ignorant should a man be of himself if others did not put him in mind
   sometimes of his failings! Therefore God makes use of virulent persons
   in the world as a rod to thrash the dust out of our garments.

   3. To humble us for our censuring. For if we have not been so tender of
   others' credit, the Lord makes us see the bitterness of the affliction
   in our own case, by giving us the like measure that we have meted unto
   others, Mat. vii. 1, 2, that is, we shall find others as hardly think
   of us as we have of them. Good thoughts and speeches of other men are
   the best preservative of our own good names. God will take care of them
   that are careful not to judge and censure. And therefore it is no great
   matter whether the report be true or false; but a Christian is to
   examine, Have not we drawn it upon ourselves by slandering others? for
   God usually payeth us home in our own coin. He that is much given to
   censuring seldom or never escapes great censures himself. It is said in
   the Psalms, Let his own words grieve him,' that is, fall upon him. How
   do our own words fall upon us? Why, the Lord punisheth us for our
   censuring of others. Oh! then, humble thyself before God for the
   reproaches thou hast cast upon others: Eccles. vii. 21, Take no heed to
   all the words spoken against thee, lest thou hear thy servant curse
   thee,' that is, speaking evil against thee. Hard sayings and speeches
   of others against us may put us in mind of God's just hand, of
   measuring to us as we have measured unto others; and therefore we
   should be the more patient if they wrong us; it is but in the like kind
   that we have wronged others. God will humble us for our censuring,
   which is so natural and rife, especially with younger, weak, and more
   unmodified persons.

   Secondly, The Lord doth it, as to humble us, so to try us.

   1. The first thing he will try in you by such a grievous affliction and
   such volleys of reproaches is your faith, when all the world is set to
   condemn you. What faith?

   [1.] Our faith in the great day of accounts, that is one great object
   of faith; and when the world is set to condemn us, our faith is tried,
   to see if we can rest with the vindication we shall have in the day of
   our Lord. So much you may see, 1 Cor. iv. 3-5, But with me it is a very
   small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment.
   Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who will
   bring to light the hidden things of darkness; and then shall every man
   have praise of God.' Every man that deserves it, and is qualified for
   it, shall have praise with God. Ela'chiston, it was a very small thing
   to be judged of man's day, because he expected God's day for the
   clearing of all things here in the world. Sin and error often get the
   major vote. Tollite impios was the cry of the rabble against
   Christians. If there was any trouble it was for the Christians' sake.
   Take away the ungodly, meaning the Christians, because they denied the
   heathen gods. Now, what was their comfort? The day of the manifestation
   of all things. So when we are looked upon as the pests of mankind, yet
   when we can comfort ourselves, there will come a day of the
   manifestation of the sons of God, that is enough, the great day of
   judgment is at hand, so this will set all things right again.

   [2.] To try our faith in more particular promises. The Lord hath
   promised to provide for the health and credit of his people; so far he
   hath promised for their safety, and their daily bread for their
   maintenance, and any earthly blessing that is good for us. Now the Lord
   will see if we can trust him with our credit as well as for other
   things: Ps. cxix. 42, So shall I have wherewith to answer him that
   reproacheth me; for I trust in thy word.' I say, the Lord hath in his
   covenant undertaken to preserve a Christian in all his interests and
   concernments, so far as shall be for his glory and our good, and so far
   we receive it. And a Christian, when he gives up himself to God, gives
   up everything he hath to God in a way of consecration to God's use. God
   is the guardian of my body and soul; I give up my estate and life that
   he may watch over me night and day, and I give up my name and credit:
   Ps. xxxi. 20, Thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the
   strife of tongues;' that the Lord may take a charge of our names as
   well as our persons and estates. Now, the Lord requires a trust in us
   according to the extent of the covenant, that is to say, a waiting, a
   confidence, that our lives are not in man's power, that he can turn the
   hearts of men, and give you favour in their eyes, when it is for his
   glory and your good: Ps. xxxvii. 5-7, Rest in the Lord, and wait
   patiently for him; commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him, and
   he shall bring it to pass.' There is the trust that is required. Oh!
   many times we seem to lose our estimation amongst men, and to be buried
   under calumnies and reproaches; but it will not be long. Your person
   and cause may be obscured, it may have a winter night of trouble; but a
   morning of resurrection, both of persons and names, will come; it will
   be brought forth as the noon-day. The Lord is able to do this; the
   integrity of your hearts will be made known, and you will be absolved
   by God. Our Lord Jesus was a pattern to us of this. Christ, when foul
   crimes were laid to his charge by his slanderers--they had charged him
   with compliance with Satan, with blasphemy and sedition--what doth he
   do? The apostle will tell you: 1 Peter ii. 23, He committed himself to
   him that judgeth righteously.' There is the faith of Christ; and
   therefore God will try this faith, whether we can with confidence and
   willingness deliver ourselves to the will of our heavenly Father and
   righteous Judge; whether we can resign up ourselves to him, to be
   disgraced or honoured as he shall think fit. When we commit and submit,
   perfectly resign up ourselves to the will of God, in confidence of his
   righteousness and faithfulness in Christ, then we behave ourselves as
   Christians.

   [3.] God will try our faith in the eternal recompenses, whether we do
   so believe the glory of heaven, the glory which shall be revealed in us
   in the other world, that we can be contented to be humbled and prepared
   for it by the reproaches of the present world: Mat. v. 11, 12, Blessed
   are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you, and shall say all
   manner of evil against you falsely for my sake.' Why? Rejoice and be
   exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven.' Oh! it is enough
   we shall have glory hereafter. Your time is now to be tried with
   dishonour, reproach, contempt, but hereafter to be honoured. And the
   heirs of promise are described to be those who, by patient continuance
   in well-doing, seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal
   life.' A Christian is not destitute of natural affections; he prizeth
   honour, but he prizeth it at the lowest rate; he looks for the glory,
   honour, and immortality that is in the other world, not in the fleshly
   vain respects of this world; and therefore now we are tried whether it
   be enough to us that we shall have glory hereafter, and here we are
   willing to take what the world will afford us. Thus God will try our
   faith.

   2. God will try our mortification and deadness to worldly credit. The
   heart is never sincere with God until it be so. Hypocrites are proud,
   self-conceited, they must be honoured among men. Now this is such an
   evil spirit, that Christ makes it incapable of faith; for, John v. 44,
   How can ye believe, that seek for glory one of another?' when we must
   have glory one from another, else our hearts are exceedingly troubled.
   Oh! it shows we are not so dead, at least as we ought to be, to credit
   in the world, to have the glory that conies from God only, his image
   implanted in us, the testimony of his love to our souls all clear
   between God and our souls; and he is not upright whose peace and
   tranquillity of spirit doth depend upon man's speeches and judgment
   rather than God's, For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but
   whom the Lord commendeth,' 2 Cor. x. 18. Men can not defend thee if God
   will condemn thee; they cannot condemn thee if God acquits thee. They
   that run a race regard not what the standers-by say, but the
   agonothetes, the great judge of the sports, he that was to give them
   the garland, what he would determine and decide in the case. So it is
   in your running, working, and striving; no matter what the world saith;
   their applause will not shelter you from God's judgment, nor will their
   condemnations or reproach expose you to God's wrath. Look to the Judge
   of all things; and we should be content with that, He is approved whom
   the Lord approves;' 2 Cor. i. 12, For our rejoicing is this, the
   testimony of our conscience.' What is the great matter of joy to him?
   The good word of men? No; he hath studied to approve himself to God,
   therefore should not be troubled overmuch. Peace of conscience is
   better than the applause of the world; certainly a man is not fit to
   have so divine a plant grow in his soul till he come to live in his
   privilege. He lives not to opinion, but lives to God's approbation.

   3. Another thing God will try is our patience. We should prevent
   reproaches as much as we can, but by a holy conversation may bear them
   when we cannot avoid them: Ps. cix. 4, For my love they are my
   adversaries, but I give myself unto prayer.' That was David's exercise,
   the revenge he took upon them, to pray to God for them. The Lord will
   try whether we have this meek humble patience, 2 Sam. xvi. 7. When
   Shimei went about railing to the peril of his life, Come out, come out,
   thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial,' and reproached him for being
   treacherous to the house of Saul, and Abishai would have taken away his
   head;' No,' saith David, let him alone; God hath bid him curse.' A mad
   dog that biteth another makes him as mad as himself. Now it should not
   be so with Christians; if they bark or bite at us, yet we should
   possess our souls with patience. It is a time of reproach and rebuke, a
   time wherein God will humble his people; therefore we should
   expostulate the case with the Lord, and humble ourselves before him,
   and see what is the matter; God hath disposed this by his providence.
   We would revenge ourselves of those that reproach us if it were in our
   power; but David had meekness and patience that would not permit it.
   God will discover the patience of his servants, say the apostles: 1
   Cor. iv. 13, Being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it;
   being defamed, we entreat; though we are set forth as the filth of the
   world, and are the off-scouring of all things unto this day;' the word
   is, the sweepings of the city, that are fit to be carried out of the
   city, to be swept away, unfit to live among men in civil societies.
   Christians, there must be a season for the trial of our graces. Now God
   makes this season for the trial of patience. Such a time as this
   discovers the strength of grace.

   4. Another thing God would have to be tried is our uprightness, whether
   we can hold on our way, through good report and bad report, in honour
   and dishonour,' as the apostle speaks, 2 Cor. vi. 8; still approve
   ourselves faithful servants of Christ. If you search into the records
   of time, you shall find many have been discouraged in Christianity
   because of reproaches that have been cast upon them, for the devil
   works much upon stomach and spleen. When Tertullian was reproached by
   certain priests at Rome, he turned Montanist. Now God will try our
   uprightness. Look, as the moon shines and holds on her course though
   the dogs bark, so we should hold on our course. Let men talk their
   pleasure, yet we should abide faithful with God: Ps. cxix. 22, Remove
   from me reproach and contempt, for I have kept thy testimonies.' David
   was not unsettled by contempt and reproach, but still kept God's
   testimonies and adhered to his ways. Some can be religious no longer
   than they can be so with honour. When reproaches come, when their
   secular interests are in danger, then they fall off, questioning the
   ways of God, and unsettling their hearts; that is, to take a revenge
   upon God himself. Hypocrites take pet, like servants that run away when
   their master strikes them; but a good servant will take a buffet
   patiently, and go about his work still. So when the Lord buffets us by
   wicked men, still we must follow our work, and go on with God.

   Thirdly, The Lord doth it to do you good, to make you better.
   Reproaches are like soap, that seems to defile the linen, it cleanseth.
   There is nothing so bad but we may make a good use of it, and a
   Christian may gain some advantage by it. Or as dung, which seems to
   stain the grass, but it makes the ground fruitful, and the grass spring
   up with a fresher verdure. So reproaches are a necessary help to make
   us more humble, heavenly--to make us walk with a holy awe This holy
   revenge we should take upon our enemies, to make us more strict and
   watchful. The way is, not to contend for esteem, but to grow better,
   more serious, more faithful in our lives; for this is the way, phimoun,
   to muzzle the mouths of adversaries, as the mouth of a dog or wild
   beast is, 1 Peter ii. 15. Passionate returns do but increase sin, but a
   holy conversation will silence all; and therefore you should confute
   calumnies, you bind up their mouths thereby. In short, an innocent,
   meek, unblamable, profitable life will certainly have its due esteem in
   the consciences of men, do what men can. Therefore, do you go on, and
   be you the more strict, and then these reproaches will do you good.
   This is the first use: advice to us what to do in case we be
   reproached.

   Use 2. To those that either devise or receive the reproach: both are
   very faulty and sinful.

   1. First, You that devise reproaches.

   [1.] You hazard the repute of your own sincerity: James i. 16, If a man
   seems to be religious, and bridles not his tongue, that man's religion
   is in vain.' Such men, that are seldom at home, seldom look to the
   state of their own hearts. Alas! if they were acquainted with
   themselves, or their own failings, they would see themselves the worst
   people in the world. Paul can see himself worse than Judas I am the
   chief of sinners'--because he hath a greater feeling of his own case.
   Now, he that is much in judging is seldom within. If a man had a
   catalogue of his own faults, he would not be so ready to blast others,
   but say, I am the chief of sinners.' Hypocrites have nothing in them
   but empty shows and appearances. It is a cheap zeal to let fly (and yet
   this is the religion of a great many) at the miscarriages and faults of
   others. No; you should rather study your own.

   [2.] You rob them of a most precious treasure; for if that of Solomon
   be true, Prov. xxii. 1, A good name is rather to be chosen than great
   riches;' they are the worst thieves that rob a man of his good name. A
   thief that pilfers and steals anything from you, he is ashamed when
   found; and should not you be ashamed, that rob a man of a more
   excellent treasure?

   [3.] You offend God, and draw public hatred upon yourselves; for
   censurers are always looked upon as the pests of the world. It is the
   devil's business, his proper work; he is called the accuser of the
   brethren,' Rev. xii. 10. The devil doth not commit adultery, break the
   Sabbath, dishonour parents; but he will slander, and accuse, and speak
   evil. The other are not commandments suited to his nature, but this is
   a commandment that may suit with angelical nature. We are not to accuse
   another wrongfully.

   Object. But must we in no case, you will say, speak evil of others? I
   answer--

   Sol. 1. Be sure that it be not a downright slander. Now, it is hard to
   avoid that. If the evil you speak be without cause, then it is against
   truth; if it be for a light and slender cause, then it is against
   charity; if it be for things indifferent, or for lesser failings, the
   indiscretions and weaknesses of Christians, all this is against that
   charity that should pass especially between the disciples of Christ:
   James iv. 11, Speak not evil of one another, brethren.' It is worse in
   Christians always to be whispering and speaking evil one of another;
   you gratify the triumphs of hell. In things doubtful, you should judge
   the best: in things hidden and secret, we cannot take cognisance of
   them, and we know not the aims and intents of the heart; that is God's
   work, 1 Cor. iv. 5; and it is the devil's work, when the practice be
   good and fair, to suspect them of hypocrisy. Besides, too, if there be
   some grievous fault, you do not know what were their temptations, how
   it may be alleviated by the temptation; still you must consider
   yourselves, lest you also be tempted,' Gal. vi. 1; and you do not know
   whether they have repented of it. The devil is a slanderer. Why? He
   doth accuse the children of God of what they are guilty of, and they
   give him too much cause to accuse them. Ay! but after repentance, after
   they are justified by God, and quitted by the grace of God; so he is a
   slanderer. So after they have repented, you are insisting on those
   faults; it is a great evil.

   Sol. 2. Speak not of him, but to him. When men are absent it is not fit
   they should be judged, for then they are not able to make a defence;
   then it is backbiting. When you thus speak of them, you exchange a duty
   for a sin, admonition for reproach. It is an un questionable duty to
   admonish one another, but it is an unquestionable sin to speak evil one
   of another.

   Sol. 3. If of him, it should be done with tenderness and grief; when
   they are incorrigible, when they are like to pervert others and
   dishonour the gospel, or for the manifest glory of God. Oh! if we would
   but lay restraints upon ourselves in this kind, and never speak of
   others, but when manifestly the glory of God calls for it. And then it
   should be with grief: Phil. iii. 19, Of whom I have told you often, and
   now weeping,' saith the apostle. There are a crew of heretics--it is
   supposed he means the Gnostics--filthy and impure persons, that had
   debauched the gospel to a licentious life; yet the apostle speaks of
   them weeping; and therefore we should be very tender of speaking of
   them. Not out of idleness and for want of other talk; that is tattle,
   forbidden in many places of scripture; not out of hatred and revenge,
   for that is malice; there may be malice where the thing you speak is
   truth; not to please others, that is flattery. But if ever you speak of
   them (and it should be with these cautions), out of zeal for the glory
   of God and the good of the church. If men did consider what restraints
   are laid upon them, they would not so easily fall upon censuring,
   reproaching, and speaking evil of others. This to those that devise
   slanders and reproaches.

   2. Secondly, To those that receive them. He is a slanderer that wrongs
   his neighbour's credit, by upholding an evil report against a man. It
   is hard to say which is worse, railing or receiving: Ps. xv. 3, a
   citizen of Sion is described to be one that taketh not up a reproach
   against his neighbour;' and you shall see, on the contrary, Prov. xvii.
   4, A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips, and a liar giveth heed to a
   naughty tongue.' He is a liar that receives a lie when brought to him,
   as well as he that brought it; if you love the lie, though you do not
   devise it. The Lord will curse all them that love lies, as if you did
   imagine them. All that are acquainted with the matter are accountable
   to God; you are responsible for your ear, as they for their tongue. It
   is good to have a healing tongue, to heal that which others wound:
   Prov. xii. 18, The tongue of the wise is health,' it is healing; and
   therefore we should labour to show forth this Christian meekness; as
   not to devise slanders against others, so not to cherish them, and
   uphold them against others.

   Use 3. If this be a usual and grievous evil, it puts us upon seeking
   comforts against reproaches. Now, what are the comforts we should seek
   against reproaches?

   1. The witness of a good conscience, for then this will be matter of
   great joy and great peace to you: 2 Cor. i. 12, This is my rejoicing,
   the testimony of my conscience,' &c. If men reproach you, yet let not
   your hearts reproach you, Job xxvii. 6. The heart hath a reproaching,
   condemning power. Conscience is register, witness, and judge; and that
   which troubles our quiet are these heart-smitings and heart-reproaches.
   Let any other man in the world be your enemy rather than your own
   conscience be an enemy. Certainly, where conscience is a friend, if you
   be innocent, you need not care for the reproaches of others. If they
   speak against you as faulty, they do but speak against another, whom
   the slanderer takes to be thee, and in time you will out-wrestle the
   reproach. Look, as the hair will grow again as long as the roots
   remain, so though the razor of censure and reproach brings on baldness,
   the hair will grow again.

   2. Another comfort against reproaches is the approbation of God; that
   should satisfy against all the censures of the world. You have the
   greatest, best, and wisest on your side, if you have God on your side.
   The world decries those that profess strictness to God's ways as
   hypocrites; but you are hypocrites indeed that are troubled at this, if
   you value man's approbation rather than God's. No; you should be of
   that temper: Rom. viii. 33, 34, Who shall lay anything to the charge of
   God's elect? It is God that justifieth.' If the Lord will acquit you,
   no matter what men say. The world's filth may be God's jewels. Many
   times a contempt doth but manifest God's esteem, and give us a further
   sense of it. They cannot impose upon God; they cannot burden their
   cause before the Lord; and therefore, if the Lord hath covered your
   filth, it is no matter though they rake in it: Ps. xxxii. 1, Blessed is
   the man whose sin is covered,' &c. The Lord will not ask their opinion,
   their vote and suffrage, whether he shall condemn or acquit you; but he
   will go according to the laws of his own covenant, and therefore the
   approbation of God should be enough to you.

   3. The consideration of those promises that concern the vindicating our
   name from contempt. God is wont to scatter the reproaches of his
   servants as the sun gets from within the cloud, to bring forth their
   righteousness as the noon-day.

   4. Heaven will make amends for all the dishonour that men put upon you.
   Though the proud scorn you, yet if you keep God's statutes, and go on
   waiting upon him for eternal life, great will be your glory in heaven.

SERMON XLV.

   Behold, I have longed after thy precepts; quicken me in thy
   righteousness.--Ver. 40.

   IN the close of the former verse David had given this commendation of
   the statutes of God, that they were good. Now, to show that he did
   indeed account them so, he allegeth his desires after them, Behold I
   have longed,' &c. In the words you have--(1.) A narrative; (2.) A
   request. The one is used as the reason of the other.

   First, In the narrative he expresseth his sincere desire of conforming
   his heart and ways to the laws of God. Where--(1.) The matter of his
   plea, { I have longed after thy precepts.' Not to know them only, but
   to do them; not to satisfy curiosity, but to understand and obey the
   will of God, and to make it the rule of his life and actions. Then (2.)
   The sincerity of it; that is intimated in the word behold. There is
   ecce admirantis, the behold of admiration, and ecce demonstrantis, the
   behold of demonstration. This last is here to be understood. We must
   look upon David as appealing to God, as offering himself unto his trial
   and approbation, who is the best witness and judge of the hearts of
   men, who knows all things, and cannot be put off with shows, O Lord, he
   speaks thus to God, Behold I have longed after thy precepts.' Now this
   is spoken here, either as a reason of his own asking, Behold, I seek it
   not out of custom, or to speak words of course, my soul is in this
   matter; or as a reason of God's granting; he urgeth his sincere
   affection to obedience as an argument likely to prevail with God: Lord,
   I have an ardent desire to serve thee; and certainly this is a great
   argument with God, for he delights to crown his own work; when he hath
   given the affection, he will give the deed, and give the performance.
   Look, as Paul urgeth others to pray for him, Pray for me, for I have a
   good conscience, willing to live honestly,' Heb. xiii. 18, so David
   here speaks of himself to God, Lord, I have longed after thy precepts;'
   it is my desire that I may be put into the readiest, fullest way of
   compliance with thy will.

   Secondly, Here is his request. There we have--(1.) The thing prayed
   for, quicken me; he prays for renewing, exciting grace. (2.) The ground
   of confidence, In thy righteousness. He had argued before from the
   disposition of the subject, now he argues from the quality of the
   donor, In thy righteousness.' The law of God is sometimes called
   righteousness, and so some expound it in that sense, Quicken me in thy
   righteousness;' that is, in the way wherein thou wouldest have me to
   walk. I think rather it is to be applied not to the righteousness he
   hath required, but the righteousness that is in God himself. So Ps. v.
   8, Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness.' Now the righteousness of God
   is put for the whole perfection of the divine essence; for his justice,
   in rendering every one their due, according to his covenant; or for his
   holiness, for his requiring, approving, delighting in the obedience of
   the creature; and for his mercy, for giving out grace to men; and for
   his veracity and faithfulness, in making good his promise, which is a
   branch of his gospel justice or righteousness; as thou art faithful in
   making good thy promises, and never wanting to those that make use of
   thy word, so, Lord, quicken me.

   Three points:--

   1. To love and long for a holy and perfect and entire subjection to the
   will of God is a good frame of heart.

   2. Those that do indeed long for holiness will see a need of new
   quickening.

   3. Those that would have quickening must seek to God, who hath promised
   to satisfy them that desire grace to walk with him.

   Doct. 1. To love and long for a holy and perfect and entire subjection
   to the will of God is a good frame of heart.

   This may be confirmed by these considerations:--

   1. All natures have a propension unto their perfect estate; as fire to
   go upward, where its place is; and heavy bodies to move downward, where
   is their seat and rest. Plants have a virtue in their seed which is
   ever working to produce their flower; beasts have an appetite by which
   their nature is nourished and preserved; and man hath a desire to
   prepare and fit him for that which is good and proper for him. The
   Psalmist tells us that God openeth his hand, and satisfieth the desire
   of every living thing,' Ps. cxlv. 16. There is an instinct in every
   living thing which leads them towards the sustaining and perfecting of
   that nature which they have. That which is called inclination in the
   creatures without life, attraction of nourishment in plants, and
   appetite in the beasts, is in man desire. And so now proportionably the
   new creature, the saints, they have an appetite suitable to their
   nature: 1 Peter ii. 2, As new-born babes desire the sincere milk of the
   word, that they may grow thereby.' Appetite still followeth life, and
   prepares men for receiving things good for them: Ps. x. 17, Lord, thou
   hast heard the desire of the humble; thou hast prepared their heart;
   thou wilt cause thine ear to hear.' A desire of relief vented in prayer
   prepares and fits us to receive those blessings which are good for us.
   And therefore, as all natures have a propension to their perfect
   estate, so those that are new creatures long and vehemently tend
   towards holiness.

   2. Desires set upon holiness are an affection properly exercised, and
   upon its due object. Desire it is an earnest reaching forth of the soul
   after good absent and not yet attained. The object of it is something
   good, and the more truly good it is the more is our desire justified.
   There are certain bastard goods of a base and transitory nature, a
   pleasure, profit: we may easily overlash and exceed in these things.
   But on holiness, which is more high and noble, and is truly good, and
   of greater vicinity and nearness to our chiefest good than those other
   things are, we cannot exceed; there the faculty is rightly placed. When
   we are hasty and passionate for these other things, the heart is
   corrupted, it is hard to escape sin: Prov. xxviii. 20, He that makes
   haste to be rich cannot be innocent;' and he that loves pleasure is in.
   danger of not loving God, or loving it more than God, 2 Tim. iii. 4.
   But now in holiness there is no such snare: a man cannot be holy
   enough, nor like enough to God; and therefore here we may freely let
   out our affections to the full. When our desires are freely let out to
   other things, they are like a member out of joint, as when the arms
   hang backward; but here they are in their proper place; this is that
   which cannot be loved beyond what it doth deserve. A Christian should
   set no manner of bounds to himself in holiness, for he is to be holy in
   all manner of conversation,' 1 Peter i. 15, and to be perfect as our
   heavenly Father is perfect,' Mat. v. 48. And then desire is not only
   after that which is good, but after a good absent. Desire ariseth from
   a sense of vacuity and emptiness. Emptiness is the cause of appetite,
   and therefore it is compared to hunger and thirst: Mat. v. 6, Blessed
   are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness.' So it is in
   desiring holiness we have not yet attained, Phil. iii. 13 There is an
   indigence and emptiness; we are not already perfect; we want more than
   we have, and our enjoyments are little in comparison of our
   expectations; and therefore we should make a swifter progress towards
   the mark, and with more earnestness of soul should press after that
   sinless estate we expect. That little we have doth but quicken us to
   inquire after more, not cloy but provoke the appetite. As a man hath a
   better stomach sometimes when he doth begin to eat, so when we begin
   with God, and have tasted of holiness, and tasted of comfort, being
   brought into a sense of obedience and subjection to God, we should
   desire more; for certainly he is not good that doth not desire to be
   better. So that David might well say, I have longed after thy
   precepts.'

   3. Consider the nature of these desires; they are the genuine birth and
   offspring of the soul, motions of the heart, freest from constraint,
   and so do best discover the temper of it, and show that it is not
   tainted and biassed with secular and worldly delights. No man can be
   constrained to will that which he doth not love. Practices may be over
   ruled. Ill men dare not act so much evil as they desire, for fear of
   shame, punishment, and other by-ends; and good men do not act so much
   good as they do desire, because of that weak and imperfect state
   wherein they are. Paul was better at willing than at doing: Rom. vii.
   18, To will is present with me, but how to perform that which is good I
   find not.' And other of the saints of God, though they could not plead
   their exact performance, and their full and effectual compliance with
   the will of God, yet have pleaded their desires: Isa. xxvi. 8, The
   desire of our soul is to thy name;' Neh. i. 11, We desire to fear thy
   name.' And Peter appeals to Christ's omnisciency,. Lord, thou knowest
   that I love thee,' John xxi. 17. The temper and constitution of their
   hearts, and the strength of grace, is seen more in desiring many times
   than in doing. These are the pulses by which you may feel the state of
   your souls, when there are longing and vehement desires of your souls
   after God's precepts.

   4. Consider the use and necessity of these desires, still the point
   will be justified. The natural use of desire is to engage us to act,
   and to keep us up in an earnest prosecution of that which is good for
   us, not withstanding the oppositions and discouragements which come
   between desire and fruition. For all good being hard to come by, unless
   desires be strongly fixed, men are soon put out of the humour, and so
   nothing would be done to any purpose in the world. Surely holiness,
   that is so difficult and distasteful to flesh and blood, would be but
   little looked after, if there were not strength of desires to keep it
   up. Therefore is this affection, that we may encounter difficulties and
   oppositions. As Neh. iv. 6, when there were difficulties and straits,
   it is said, They built the wall, for the people had a mind to work;'
   that is, their hearts were set upon it. So if we had a mind to any
   excellent thing, it is this mind that keeps us up in the midst of all
   difficulties and labours. All excellent things are hard to come by; it
   is so in earthly matters, much more in spiritual. The Lord will have it
   so, to make us prize them more, for things soon got are little
   esteemed; as riotous heirs, which know not how to get an estate,
   lavishly spend it. A man is chary of what is hardly gotten. Jacob
   prized Rachel the more because he was forced to serve for her so long.
   So we shall prize heavenly things the more when they cost us a great
   deal of diligence and labour to get them. Now, sluggish desires soon
   fail, but vehement longings keep the heart awork.

   5. Consider the issue of these desires. As they come from a good cause,
   which is the new nature and a new life, for appetite follows life, so
   they tend to a good effect, are sure of a good accomplishment and
   satisfaction. God is wont to give spiritual things to those that desire
   them; there the rule is, Ask and have.' It is not so in carnal things:
   many that seek and hunt after them with all the strength and labour of
   their souls, at length are miserably disappointed; but all the promises
   run for satisfaction to a hungry, thirsty, earnest and longing soul,
   Mat. v. 6. Those that are hungry, and have a strong desire upon them,
   he will fill, Luke i. 51; and open thy mouth wide and I will fill it,'
   Ps. lxxxi. 10; they that open unto him as the thirsty land for the
   rain. God, that gives velle, to will, will give posse, to do; first the
   desire, and then the satisfaction; and therefore, where there is this
   strength of desire, though there may be some failing in other things in
   our endeavours and performances, yet the Lord will accept it.

   6. It argues some nearness to complete fruition, or to full
   satisfaction in heaven, when we begin to be more earnest after holiness
   than we were before, and after more of God and his grace and image to
   be set up in our souls. The more we desire holiness, the more ripe for
   heaven. This is a rule. The nearer we are to any good thing our hearts
   are set upon, the more impatient in the want of it; as natural motions
   are swifter in the end than in the beginning, though violent motions
   are swifter in the beginning; while the impression of the stone lasts
   it is swift, but afterwards it abates. So when the soul beats so
   strongly after God and holiness and larger measures of grace, it is a
   sign we are ripening apace for heaven. Paul, when he was grown aged in
   Christianity, then he saith, Rom. vii. 24, Who shall deliver me from
   this body of death?' As what we translate in the Psalms, Oh that
   salvation were come out of Sion!' It is in the Hebrew, Who shall give
   salvation?' So here; it is an Hebraism, Who shall? that is, Oh, that I
   were delivered! He had many afflictions; he was in perils often,
   scourged, whipped, persecuted; but he doth not say, Oh, that I could
   get rid of this troublesome life of affliction! but it was the body of
   death, the remainders of corruption, was most burdensome to him. The
   children of God their pulses beat strongly when they are upon the
   confines of eternity and their full and final consummation. These men
   begin to ripen for their heavenly state into which God will translate
   them.

   Use 1. For conviction of several sorts of persons that are far from
   this temper and frame of heart. To begin with the most notorious.

   1. Some desire sin with a passionate earnestness: Job xv. 16, He
   drinketh iniquity like water.' As a thirsty beast in those hot
   countries would drink in water, so did they drink in sin. Most wicked
   men are mad when their lusts are set a-working; and there are some
   whose constant frame of heart it is, who make haste, who march
   furiously, as if they were afraid of coming to hell too late; bear down
   conscience, word, and all before them; that set themselves to do evil
   with both hands earnestly; that have a strong desire after sin, and are
   carried out with as impatient longing after sin as the children of God,
   such eminent ones of God, after holiness.

   2. Some have no desire to the ways of God at all: Job xxi. 14, They say
   unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.'
   The hearts of many say so, though their tongues do not. They are those
   which shut out the light, that cannot endure a searching ministry, lest
   it should trouble their lusts, disturb the devil's kingdom; that banish
   the thoughts of God out of their hearts, lest it revive the sense of
   their obligation to duty; that set conscience a-challenging God's right
   in their souls; that keep off from the light.

   3. There are some that are insatiable in worldly things, but have no
   savour of these heavenly and holy things; they are thirsty for the
   earth, but God is not in all their thoughts,' Ps. x. 4; a little grace
   will serve their turn, and think there is more ado than needs about
   heaven and heavenly things. Alas! the very contrary is true; a little
   of the world will serve their turn here below. If men had not a mind to
   increase their temptations and snares about a frail and temporal life,
   why do they make so much ado, when many times they are taken away
   before they have roasted what they have got in hunting? God takes them
   away, but their eternal estate is little looked after. Riches qualify
   us not, but holiness doth qualify us for heaven, and it is our ornament
   before God and his holy angels. And woe be to us if our poor souls be
   thrust out naked and unclothed in the other world! Can we hunger and
   hanker after these lying vanities, and have no hungering and thirsting
   after grace? A little time will wear out the distinction of rich and
   poor, high and low; but the distinction of holy and good will continue
   to eternity. Think of that time when not only the world, but the lust,
   will pass away. The lust of the world may be gone before we are out of
   the world, as in sickness and pains; but he that doth the will of God
   abideth for ever. When we are sick and dying we have some kind of
   notions and apprehensions of these things; then we can long and wish we
   had served God more strictly, loved him more strongly, obeyed him more
   faithfully. We must have these thoughts while we are living.

   4. Many desire happiness, but not holiness; comfort, without grace;
   they would be eased of their present smart, and freed from sin, but not
   subdued to God. David saith, Behold I have longed after thy precepts;'
   not merely after the comfort of the promises, without regard to duty.
   The prophet tells us, Hosea x. 11, that Ephraim was like a heifer that
   was taught, that would tread out the corn, but would not endure the
   yoke, and break the clods.' In ploughing and harrowing there was very
   hard work, but no profit; but in treading out the corn (for as we
   thresh out our corn, so they trode it out by the feet of oxen), the
   mouth of the ox was not to be muzzled, that there might be a great deal
   of privilege and profit with it. So Ephraim is like a heifer that is
   taught. They taught the oxen to tread out the corn; but we will not
   endure the yoke; that is, we are all for privileges, but neglect
   obedience. There is so such great difficulty about the end; indeed, we
   are careless about it; all the business is, we stick at the means: Mat.
   vi. 33, Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness.' By the
   kingdom of God' is meant, the royal privileges and immunities of the
   gospel state; and by his righteousness' is meant the subjection, the
   service God requires of us. Now it is good when we seek both, but we
   must not seek one without the other; God and the world would sooner
   agree. If God would bestow the privileges of his kingdom, and dispense
   with the duties, God might have customers enough for comfort, pardon,
   heaven, happiness. No man is so senseless as not to desire these things
   in some measure; but they will not come to God's price, they do not
   desire these things upon God's terms. The hearts of the saints are as
   earnestly after sanctification when they are acquainted with God, and
   brought under the power of grace, that holiness may be increased in
   them; as Rom. vii. 24, Oh, that I were delivered from sin! Ps. cxix. 5,
   Oh, that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!' Not only for the
   happy part of religion, but they are longing how they may please God,
   and comply with their manifold obligations to God, and brought to a
   more perfect conformity to God. Thus the hearts of the saints work.

   5. There are many pretenders to a fair respect to God's precepts; they
   are as much for holiness as for pardon and grace, when it is nothing
   so.

   [1.] They say they desire to obey God in all things; but can they
   seriously and sincerely appeal to God for the sincerity and truth of
   what they say; for so doth David here when he comes to God, Behold, I
   have longed for thy precepts;' or as Peter appeals to Christ, John xxi.
   17, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee;' that is to say, when they
   have revived the sense of the nature of God, and of his all-seeing eye
   upon their hearts, when they have a due sense of God upon their souls;
   otherwise they deal deceitfully. Alas! an evil conscience is afraid; it
   cannot offer itself thus to God when they are serious and think of what
   they say; they cannot endure to think of his trial, as an eye hurt
   seeks for a cover to hide it from the light. So when a sense of God is
   lessened; they may talk presumptuous expressions of their own
   sincerity; but when they are most serious, and have revived the sense
   of God upon their hearts, and look upon him as an all-seeing God that
   searcheth the heart, they cannot say then, I have longed after thy
   precepts.'

   [2.] They not only say so, but they think so, that they desire holiness
   as much as others, when indeed it is no such matter. The deceit lies in
   this, because they take a wish for a desire, a velleity for a volition.

   Quest. What is the difference between a wish and a desire?

   Ans. Very great.

   1. They that have only a wish for holiness, they love holiness in the
   abstract and in the general notion, which they hate in the effect; they
   do not know what is included in holiness and close-walking with God; as
   John vi. 34, Evermore give us of this bread of life.' But when Christ
   told them what it was to have this bread of life, then they were
   offended. So the Israelites, when they considered holiness and the
   service of God in the abstract, Oh! we will serve the Lord, say they,
   saith Joshua, You cannot serve the Lord, for he is a jealous God,'
   Josh. xxiv. 18, 19. Holiness in the abstract and notion is amiable, and
   is apprehended as a necessary thing; but now, when it comes to the
   point of entering in at the strait gate, walking in the narrow way of
   watching and striving against sin, of rowing against the stream of
   flesh and blood, of constant communion with God, and diligent
   attendance upon his holy worship, then they will do nothing. When they
   take up their duty by the lump, they are well pleased with it, and it
   is easy to give up to God in the general, but particulars we stick at.
   Therefore here is the fault in these wishes and velleities, that they
   do not sufficiently poise their duty.

   2. These wishes are hasty and not serious. The commendation of
   spiritual things, and the representation of their absolute necessity,
   may produce strange motions for the present; but there is a ground of
   suspicion, because people all of a sudden become so vehement. The seed
   that fell into the stony ground forthwith sprang up, Mat. xiii. 5. Oh!
   but it needs much wrestling and care to cherish and raise up these
   serious and fixed desires, and this constant bent of heart towards God.
   Free-will pangs of natural devotion are soon spent; they are like the
   morning dew, it suddenly falls, and suddenly dries up. Deut. v. 29,
   when the people were frightened into a sense of religion, say they, All
   that the Lord hath spoken will we do.' They have well said,' saith God,
   it is a good resolution;' But oh! that there were such a heart in them
   that they would fear me always.' Many times there are certain desires
   and resolutions that have a mortal sincerity in them--that is, we do
   not dissemble for the present--but they have not a, bottom of grace,
   supernatural sincerity to bear them up.

   3. They are not constant desires, but as they are soon up, so soon
   down. Our Lord Jesus saith, Mat. v. 6, Blessed are they that do hunger
   and thirst after righteousness;' not only shall be, but are blessed for
   the present. Mark, it is in the Greek, They that are hungering and
   thirsting;' these participles, as all grammarians know, note a
   continued act. The fire on the altar was never to go out, Lev. vi. 12.
   There are certain unfixed desires and inconstant motions which for a
   time are very passionate; as water, seething hot over the fire; take it
   off, it returns to its natural temper, and it is colder afterwards; so
   the soul returns to its bias and old bent again towards worldly things.
   Therefore there must be a constant desire kept up. Such as enjoy the
   grace of God will still need and desire more. This is the constant
   temper of their souls; they are always desiring and longing after God's
   precepts, and more grace to keep his will.

   4. In those desires which they seem to have after holiness, here is the
   defect, they are not laborious. He that longs for God's precepts will
   do his utmost endeavour that he may yield uniform obedience to God. The
   scripture placeth much upon the will. Macarius, an ancient practical
   writer, puts this question, Who are those that have a will to God and
   heavenly things, and a will to the waters of life? What demonstrations
   can there be of a will? Nothing but constant labour. If there be such a
   will as to set you awork, and a desire which makes you diligent. Lazy
   prayers and feeble endeavours, they do not argue any great strength of
   desire. Alas! when a man asketh grace indifferently and coldly, and is
   almost at an even point whether God hears him or no, and doth not seek
   after that grace, and excite his soul, this man hath not a desire,
   because it is not laborious. If it be not an operative desire, it is
   but a velleity; a will it is not. All their prayers are but the
   ejaculations of speculative fancy, not the products of true affection,
   for that would be industrious: Prov. xxi. 25, The desire of the
   slothful killeth, for his hands refuse to labour.' They do not manifest
   the life and strength of love in their endeavours that they seem to
   have in their prayers. Cold prayer they may put up for grace that God
   may make them better; and they wish it were better with them, and that
   the Lord would bring them to a greater conformity; but these are not
   laborious desires. Volens sed nolens, they would, but they will not;
   that is to say, Oh, that I were at such a place! and never travel the
   way to get there. So, Would I had learned such a lesson I yet like a
   lazy boy they set not themselves in good earnest to do it. They seem to
   will or wish; therefore they are but wouldings, not willings. They do
   not in good earnest set themselves to get that grace. There is not such
   an invincible resolution to get through, and a serious industry that
   they may attain those things they seem to long for.

   5. These wishes and desires which are in carnal men are not permanent,
   that overcome the desire of other things; they will not absolutely set
   about it to be done whatever it cost them: but such desires as are
   sincere overcome all earthly desires and delights whatever. They would
   have grace, but yet would live as they do. It is not such a desire as
   to control other things, but is controlled by them. The desire of grace
   is an underling, and mastered by the desire of pleasures or profits of
   the world, and other delights. Many have a desire, but it is easily
   subdued, it is not prevalent. Alas! there may a faint desire be stirred
   up by enlightened conscience, and not by a fruit of a renewed will. A
   dictate of conscience must be distinguished from a desire of the heart.
   Illuminated conscience tells them they must grow more holy and
   heavenly, and wish they were so; but the heart is not perfectly subdued
   to God. They are directed by their interest; they make not this the
   main and great interest of their lives. David, when he expresseth his
   desires, mentions it thus: Ps. xxvii. 4, One thing have I desired of
   the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the
   Lord all the days of my life;' that is, 1 will make this my business,
   the chiefest matter of my care. But now, they that care not whether
   they have it, yea or nay, this cannot be a desire: Phil. ii. 12, we are
   bid to work out our salvation with fear and trembling.' We must carry
   on the business of godliness with a great deal of solicitude; but their
   affections sway them more to other things.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON XLVI.

   Behold I have longed after thy precepts, &c.--Ver. 40.

   I COME now to a second use, and that is--

   Use 2. To press us to long after holiness and subjection to God.

   Two motives:--

   First, You shall have these desires granted. For a man to have his
   will, and whatsoever he desires, what a happiness is that! If his soul
   be set upon holy things, he shall have what he desires, the Lord will
   not be wanting: Prov. x. 24, The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon
   him; but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.' The desires of
   the righteous are suitable to the constitution and frame of their
   heart. He will grant the desires of their souls, Ps. x. 17. A man that
   makes God his heart's delight shall have his heart's desire: Ps.
   xxxvii. 4, Delight thyself in the Lord, and he shall give thee the
   desire of thy heart;' his business is to maintain communion with God,
   and his desires will not miscarry.

   Secondly, When they are granted it shall do you no hurt: Prov. xi. 23,
   The desire of the righteous is only good, but the expectation of the
   wicked is wrath.' It is the greatest judgment to wicked men when God
   gives them a heart to desire a full affluence of earthly comforts.
   Better to be denied in mercy, than to have our requests granted in
   anger. But grace will do us no hurt; it will not increase our snares
   and temptations, as other things do; and therefore can never be given
   in anger, but always in love. Well, then--(1.) Fix your desires; (2.)
   See they do not abate in you.

   1. Fix your desires and enlarge them to the full. A carnal man may be a
   shame to a godly man, because he is carried out so earnestly, and with
   such uniform respect to earthly things: 1 Cor. xii. 31, Covet earnestly
   the best gifts;' this is a holy covetousness, and a good diversion from
   that great sin. As the covetous learn all the arts of thriving, are
   always joining house to house, and field to field,' Isa. v. 8, so
   should we add faith to faith, and obedience to obedience. Our
   enjoyments are better, and therefore it should not be followed with a
   slacker hand. The more a covetous man hath in the world, the more he
   desires still. Should not we forget the things that are behind, and
   reach forth to the things that are before us'? Still here the taste
   increaseth the appetite, like sea-water, that wets the palate, but
   inflames the appetite. Now, shall not we be carried out with a holy
   covetousness thus to God? See what help and methods of increase they
   use, how their desire carrieth them on in unwearied diligence: They
   rise early, sit up late, eat the bread of sorrows,' Ps. cxxvii. 2; and
   all to heap up a little pelf to themselves; neglect no occasion of
   gain: and shall not we make it the business of our lives, and be
   projecting still how we may grow in grace, and increase in the love of
   God, and ripen for the heavenly state, and grow more like God every
   day? You know how sparing they are, and how apprehensive of their
   losses. Oh! should not the decays of religion go as near us? and should
   not we be careful that we do not waste that grace we have received, and
   that we increase it more and more, and that it thrive upon our hands?

   2. Watch against the abatement of your desires, for they are of great
   use to you in the spiritual life. If a man lose his appetite, the body
   pineth and languisheth, and strength decayeth. What appetite is to the
   body, that desire is to the soul; it fitteth us to take in our
   supplies, and putteth us upon action and diligence; it is the vigorous
   bent of the soul. Therefore see that it doth not decay. It is said,
   Rev. ii. 4, of the church of Ephesus, that she had lost her first
   love,' and then presently left her first works.' Now your desire
   decayeth when your prayers are less fervent, for prayer is the
   presenting our desires to God, or vent given to spiritual groans.
   Therefore keep up your desires: Ps. xxvii. 4, One thing have I desired
   of the Lord, and that I will seek after.' When the desires are fixed,
   endeavours are engaged; our desires must be pursued resolutely. But
   what shall we do to awaken these earnest longings in our souls, and
   those desires after holiness?

   [1.] Go to God, for he giveth both to will and to do, Phil. ii. 13. All
   is from God; the will is from God, and the deed from God. The will; I
   bring that to show how you should beg that he would stir up those
   earnest desires in you, because all affections are but the vigorous
   motions of the will. Desire is but passionate will, or the will
   effectually and powerfully excited or stirred up to some absent good.
   Now the appetite is from God as well as the meat. Desire of grace is an
   affection above nature, and must be planted in us by the Spirit of God.
   God gives the desire, and he satisfies it. He draws,' then we run after
   him,' Cant. i. 4. He puts this desire in our hearts, then we are
   carried on with an earnest pursuit after grace.

   [2.] Would you have and keep up ardent desires? Do as they do that
   would keep in the fire, cherish the sparks and blow them up to a flame.
   There is no man that lives under the means of grace, and under the
   discoveries of God and religion, but hath his good moods and very
   lively motions; the waters are stirred many times. Take hold of this
   advantage, Strengthen the things that remain and are ready to die,'
   Rev. iii. 2, and blow up these sparks into a flame. God hath left us
   enkindling means prayer, meditation, and the word. Observe where the
   bellows blows hardest, and ply that course. The more supernatural
   things are, there needs more diligence to preserve them. A strange
   plant needs more care than a native of the soil. Worldly desires, like
   a nettle, breed of their own accord, but spiritual desires need a great
   deal of cultivating.

   [3.] Improve your tastes: 1 Peter ii. 3, If you have tasted that the
   Lord is gracious;' and Col. i. 6, Since ye knew the grace of God in
   truth.' When you have got any taste of the worth of these spiritual
   things, they do not cloy but awaken appetite. Fancy and imagination
   cannot awaken it so much as this taste. When you have tasted how good
   and sweet it is to live in a state of conformity, this will make you
   long for more: Ps. lxiii. 1, My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh
   longeth for thee.' David had been acquainted with the pleasures of the
   sanctuary, therefore longs for them more. He that hath tasted honey is
   more affected with it than he that hath only read of it. The Gauls,
   when they had tasted of the wine of Italy, nothing would keep them from
   pressing into the country. So when we have tasted of the clusters of
   Canaan, the first-fruits of the Spirit, this should encourage and whet
   our appetite.

   [4.] Watch over other desires, such as would dull and blunt the edge of
   the spirit. As iron drives out iron, so one desire drives out another.
   If we are taken with other things, Christ loseth his sweetness and
   relish. Vain worldly desires extinguish those that are spiritual and
   heavenly: they lose their fervour when prostituted to base objects;
   your prayers are more flat and cold, for your desires are manifested by
   prayer and industry. Now your desires will flag and abate when you let
   out your hearts to the world; therefore you must watch lest the carnal
   savour and carnal minding increaseth upon you, for then the spiritual
   minding is quite hindered, impeached, [15] and interrupted: Rom. viii.
   5, For they that after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh, but
   they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit.' When outward
   things would steal away your hearts and affections from God, remember
   your first choice: Whom have I in heaven but thee?' &c., Ps. lxxiii.
   25.

   [5.] Renew your desires every time you come to God. When you come to
   the word, come with an appetite; prepare your stomachs always for God's
   food. They see more of Christ in an ordinance that come most unworthy
   in their own sense. John vii. 37, saith Christ, If any man thirst, let
   him come unto me and drink.' You shall have Benjamin's portion, and
   more plentifully filled, when you come with a strong appetite and a
   holy longing after God and his grace. Christ takes it best when you
   come with most enlarged desires and raised expectations. Did God ever
   fail a thirsty soul? Luke xxii. 15, With desire I have desired to eat
   this passover with you before I die.' Christ himself hungered and
   thirsted for us, he longed to give us pledges of his love; and shall
   not we say, With desire have I desired to taste of thy feast and eat of
   thy supper? Christ longs to give, and shall not we long to take?
   Certainly where there is this earnest working of heart towards God, and
   this desire, the Lord will fill it. The gaping of young ravens, God
   satisfies it; the Psalmist concludes from thence, Ps. cxlv. 19, He will
   fulfil the desire of them that fear him; he also will hear their cry
   and will save them.' Naturalists observe the raven exposeth her young
   ones, and they are merely fed by providence; but when they gape, the
   Lord satisfieth them with that food which is convenient for them: much
   more will he fulfil the desires of the humble.

   [6.] Consider your wants, and the fulness that is in Christ, and his
   readiness to impart unto you.

   (1.) Your wants. I speak not now of a total want. Indeed, if those that
   are under a total want of soul could be brought to consider their
   condition, the work of conversion would not stick so long as it doth.
   But I speak now of such a want as remains in the saints after they have
   begun with God, and been put in a way of obedience. It is not enough
   that the soul is once come to Christ, but it is the business of our
   lives; we must be always coming: 1 Peter ii. 4, If so be ye have tasted
   that the Lord is gracious, to whom coming as unto a living stone.' If
   you have tasted, then come to him for more. They must be frequently
   renewing the acts of their faith, and stirring up their desires, else
   there will be no growth of grace, no opposing corruption; for all our
   strength is in him; there is still something lacking to our faith, and
   all the graces of the Spirit that are in us.

   (2.) Consider what a fulness there is in Christ. This encouraged the
   prodigal, that in his father's house there is bread enough. So should
   this encourage us, and awaken our desires; there is enough in Christ if
   I will but go and take it, and receive from this ever-flowing fountain
   of grace that God hath set up in our nature: John i. 16, Of his fulness
   have we all received.' Christ hath not only plenitudinem vasis, the
   fulness of a vessel, but fontis, the fulness of a fountain. The fulness
   of a vessel, that may be lessened; the more we take from it the less
   liquor is in it; but the more we take from a fountain, still there is
   the same overflowing fulness. Such a fulness is in Christ; therefore it
   is an encouragement to us to repair to him and enlarge our desires.
   Look, as it is with beggars in the streets, if they see a poor man
   meanly clad, they let him alone, but when they see a man of quality and
   fashion they rouse up themselves and besiege him with importunate
   entreaties and clamours, and will not let him go until he hath left
   something with them. Thus should we do. Christ hath enough and to
   spare; he hath the Spirit without measure; therefore give him not over
   until he bestow something upon you. He containeth more than we can
   receive; whatever we get he is not lessened; but, as the sea, though we
   take never so much water out of it, it remains in the same fulness, so
   all the saints may have supply for their wants without any deficiency
   in Christ. The sun hath not less light, though it communicate it freely
   to the inferior world. Christ is not spent for giving; he hath enough
   to comfort and quicken us; he needs not our fulness, but emptiness. The
   prophet provided oil enough to help the widow; she only provided empty
   vessels. We may be too full for Christ, but cannot be too empty. We may
   be too full of self-righteousness and self-sufficiency. Christ brings
   all-sufficiency to the covenant, and we bring all-necessity. Therefore,
   since there is such an overflowing fulness in him, we must still repair
   to him that we may receive more.

   (3.) Consider his readiness to give it you, therefore come with
   hungering and thirsting after him: John vi. 27, Labour for the meat
   that endureth for ever.' Mind the graces of the Spirit, come to Christ
   for these things. He was sent into the world, and commissioned for this
   end and purpose. All the fulness in Christ is for our use. As the sun
   hath light not for itself but for the comfort of the world, and a
   fountain hath water riot for itself, but for the use of man; so Christ
   the head is the seat of sense and motion, not for himself, but for his
   whole body; he is our storehouse for the supply of our wants; and he is
   clothed, empowered, and invested with offices to do us good. Oh,
   therefore enlarge your desires! In other things you desire to be full,
   why not of grace? Hypocrites are satisfied with a taste; they may taste
   the good word. Temporaries are contented with a taste; a little
   religion they must have. Ay! but it is for the honour of Christ that we
   should be complete in him, and filled with all the fulness of God; and
   this is his grief when his grace runs waste. Look, as when breasts are
   full, there is a great pleasure in having them drawn, or children to
   have them sucking; and the Lord hath as great a desire to impart his
   holiness as we to receive it. Therefore come to him that we may have
   grace for grace, that is, for grace's sake. Thus much for the first
   point. David's appeal to God, Lord, I have longed after thy precepts.'

   Doct. 2. Those that indeed long for holiness will see a need of new
   quickening.

   So David, Quicken me in thy righteousness.' A man would have thought he
   had been in a lively frame then; yet Quicken me in thy righteousness;'
   excite and enliven me to all acts of obedience.

   Here I shall inquire--

   1. What is this quickening.

   2. Why they that long for God's precepts, and a more perfect and ready
   subjection to God, are thus earnest for quickening.

   First, What is this quickening? I shall not speak at large, for it
   often occurs in this psalm. It is used in scripture for two things:--

   1. For regeneration, or the first infusion of the life of grace, Eph.
   ii. 1, 5. Then we have divine qualities put into us, that do incline
   and enable us to live unto God.

   2. It is put for the vitality and the vigour of grace, when the
   spiritual life is in good plight. Deadness of heart is apt to creep
   upon us, therefore we need renewed excitations and quickenings, that we
   may serve our God with cheerfulness, liveliness, and zeal. Christians
   should not only be living but lively; 1 Peter ii. 5, Ye also as lively
   stones are built up a spiritual house. And we read of living grace and
   lively grace, 1 Peter i. 3. And Christ came into the world that we
   might not only have life,' but have it more abundantly,' John x. 10;
   that is, that we might not only be living, but lively. So that
   quickening is the actuation of the spiritual life, either in a way of
   comfort or grace. There may be life where there is not this vigour and
   this vitality. This quickening is mainly seen in the most operative,
   and the two necessary graces of the soul to which the gospel is
   sometimes reduced, and they are faith and love. These are the graces
   wherein life consists; and as these are acted and excited to God, so we
   are lively, and when these decay we are dead. When faith is dead all
   spiritual activity is lost: James ii. 26, For as the body without the
   spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.' If men want faith
   they cannot do anything with any life. So when love is dead, or love
   grows cold, Mat. xxiv. 12, or when men have any abatement in their
   love, all languisheth and grows dead in the soul, Rev. ii. 4, 5. But on
   the contrary, it is said we live by faith, Gal. ii. 20. Grace is kept
   in good plight when faith is strong and kept up in any vigour; and Gal.
   v. 6, Faith, which worketh by love.'

   Well, this quickening (that I may most sensibly demonstrate it) depends
   upon these two things:--

   [1.] The vitality of grace; that depends upon the degree and mea sure
   of our faith. For to speak nothing as to the mystical use, as it is a
   means of our function of life, but to speak only now as to its moral
   use, as it acts by the sight of invisible things, keep faith alive, and
   all is alive in the soul: Heb. xi. 1. Faith is the evidence of things
   not seen;' it doth make things absent and things not seen to act as if
   they were present, therefore it must needs be a very enlivening thing.
   Without faith our notions of God, Christ, heaven, and hell are never
   practical and lively in operation; for this is the evidence of things
   not seen, and this convinceth us of all spiritual and unseen things, to
   make them have a force and operation upon the soul. We do but hear,
   read, and discourse literally until faith puts life into our
   apprehensions and thoughts of them; for faith will affect us as if we
   did see the invisible God, and will put the same affections into us as
   if Christ were crucified before our eyes, Gal. iii. 1. What is the
   reason the mystery of redemption is a wild story to some, lively to
   others? Faith affects the heart as if he were crucified before our
   eyes, and his life dropped out from him by degrees. So faith makes us
   hug and embrace them as if we were in the midst of the glory of the
   blessed ones. Take it only in its moral use, it is an enlivening thing;
   and as faith is kept up in any vigour, so the spiritual life is kept
   up.

   [2.] For love. When we have a fresh and warm sense of the love of God
   upon our souls, we are quickened to do for him answerably to such a
   love; and our souls reason, What, hath God done so great things for us
   in Christ, and we do nothing for God again? Then we see we cannot do
   anything too much. Love hath a law upon the soul that stirs up lively
   and zealous motions towards God: 2 Cor. v. 14, The love of Christ
   constraineth us;' 1 John v. 3, His commandments are not grievous.' Then
   everything goes on pleasantly, and runs upon its wheels.

   Secondly, Why will they that long after God's precepts see a need of
   quickening?

   1. Because of the diseases incident to the renewed estate. There is a
   constant weakness by reason of indwelling corruption: The flesh lusteth
   against the spirit,' Gal. v. 17; they cannot serve God with that purity
   and liberty they desire. Then there are frequent indispositions of
   soul; sometimes they feel a slowness and loathness and dulness in their
   souls. Good men may yet be slow of heart to heavenly things, Luke xxiv.
   25. Look, as the physician saith weariness that comes of its own accord
   is a sign of some disease upon us, laziness in duty comes from a remiss
   will. Sometimes too they find great deadness, that they cannot follow
   their work so closely, and with that life and earnestness. And
   sometimes they are in bonds, sometimes in straits, that they cannot
   enlarge and dilate themselves towards God: Ps. cxix. 32, When thou
   shalt enlarge my heart, I will run the ways of thy commandments.' Now
   they that mind their work, they will be sensible of this, and call upon
   God to quicken them. David complains of the dulness and deadness of his
   spirit; but many do not, but go on in a cold track of duties, and never
   regard the frame of their hearts. But now a good man observes the
   temper of his soul. Most observe their bodies, but few their souls. If
   their body be ill at ease and out of order, they complain presently;
   but love waxeth cold, zeal for God and delight in God abateth, men grow
   weary in well-doing, grow flat, have this remiss will, this deadness
   and slowness of soul in the love of God, they can satisfy themselves in
   this frame and temper.

   2. Because, too, without this supervening and quickening grace, they
   can never serve God cheerfully, nor do anything to purpose in the
   heavenly life; our general work of obedience goes on slowly: Ps. cxix.
   88, Quicken me, so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth,' then I
   shall do good to purpose. But religion is an irksome thing when we are
   dead-hearted. For particular duties, it is not enough to pray, but it
   must be with life: Ps. lxxx. 18, Quicken us, and we will call upon thy
   name.' It is not enough to hear, but to hear with life, Mat. xiii. 15.
   It is a judgment to be dull of hearing.

   3. As it is uncomfortable to themselves to act without quickening
   grace, so it is a thing very hateful with God, a cold lukewarm temper:
   Rev. iii. 16, I will spew thee out of my mouth. 1 This dull and stupid
   profession is contrary to God and hateful to God, and such as content
   themselves with this dead profession, God will spew them out of his
   mouth. And it is contrary to all the provision God hath made for us.
   Christ is set up as a fountain of grace in our nature: John x. 10, I am
   come that they might have life, and that they might have it more
   abundantly.' The Lord hath justified us by his grace, sprinkled our
   hearts that we might serve the living God, serve him in a living
   manner; for titles given to God imply the qualification in hand, Heb.
   ix. 14; and he hath sanctified us, planted grace in our hearts on
   purpose to maintain the life given us, that there might be a lively
   hope. And all hearing is for life, Isa. lv. 3; we come to lively
   oracles that we may be quickened. The joys of heaven, redemption by
   Christ, hell's torments, these doctrines are all quickening truths. And
   the Lord hath given his flesh, not only to God for a sacrifice, but to
   us for food that we may live, John vi. 51. Therefore to be cold is
   odious to God.

   Use 1. For caution.

   1. Let us take heed we lose not quickening through our own default,
   that we lose not this enlivening grace. We may lose it by any heinous
   sin of ours, for by grieving the Spirit we bring on deadness upon the
   heart, Ps. li. 10-12. When David sinned heinously, he begs the Lord to
   quicken him, and restore his free spirit and the joy of his salvation.
   The spirit is a tender thing. Every heinous sin is as a wound in the
   body, which lets out the life-blood, and so we contract a deadness upon
   ourselves.

   2. Take heed of immoderate liberty, or vanities of the world, or
   pleasures of the flesh, if you would not lose this quickening. The
   apostle tells us, 1 Tim. v. 6, The woman that liveth in pleasure is
   dead while she liveth.' Pleasures have a strange infatuation; they
   bring a brawn and deadness upon the heart, and hinder the sprightliness
   of spiritual and heavenly affections: Ps. cxix. 37, Turn away mine eyes
   from be holding vanity, and quicken thou me in thy way.' These two
   prayers joined together speak thus much: if you be too busy about
   vanity, it will bring on a brawn and deadness, and so you need to go to
   God for quickening. And Christ tells his disciples, Luke xxi. 34, Take
   heed of being overcharged,' &c. The soul is mightily distempered by too
   free a liberty of the delights of the flesh; for surfeiting and
   drunkenness must not be taken there in the gross notion.

   3. Let us take heed that we do not lose it by our slothfulness and
   negligence in the spiritual life: Isa. lxiv. 7, There is none that
   stirreth up himself to take hold of thee.' As in a watch one wheel
   protrudes and thrusts forward another, so when we are diligent all is
   lively in the soul, but when we are not active and serious in a godly
   course all goes to rack. An instrument, though it be never so much in
   tune, yet laid by and hung up, it grows out of order. Wells are sweeter
   for draining; our graces, if we keep them not awork, lose their
   vitality; if we do not stir up the grace of God, 2 Tim. i. 6, they are
   quite quenched; when we grow careless, and neglectful of our souls, we
   lose this activity of grace.

   4. Vain and dead-hearted company and converse are a very great means to
   damp the spirit and quench the motions of the heavenly life. We should
   provoke one another to good works,' Heb. x. 24. There is great
   provocation in good examples; but we grow lazy, formal, slight by
   imitation. Others profess knowledge, yet are vain, dead-hearted; so are
   we, we have adopted it into our manners, and leaven one another by this
   means. There should be a holy contention who should be most forward in
   the ways of godliness, and excel in our heavenly calling; this keeps
   Christians lively. Saul, when he was among the prophets, he prophesied;
   but when we converse with dead-hearted company, it breeds a great damp.
   You read in Isa. xli. 6, 7, how the idolaters encouraged one
   another--it was when the isles were to wait for the Messiah--that they
   should not faint, but get up their idols again, after Christ had got a
   little footing among them; and shall not the children of God encourage,
   and keep up the life of zeal one in another?

   Use 2. Exhortation. It presseth you to divers duties.

   1. To see a need of quickening. Though life received gives power to
   act, yet that power must be excited by God. No creature doth subsist
   and act of itself. All things live, move, and have their being in God.
   There is a concurrence necessary to all created things, much more to
   the new creature: partly because of the internal indisposition of the
   subject in which it is--alas! grace in the heart is but like fire in
   wet wood--partly by reason of external impediments; Satan is ready to
   cast a damp upon the soul, so that the Lord's grace is still necessary
   for us.

   2. Ask it of God. All life was at first in him originally, and it is an
   emanation from him. The apostle proves Christ's Godhead from this,
   because in him was life,' John i. 4. But is this a good argument? Doth
   that prove therefore he was God? May we not say of the meanest worm, in
   it is life? But he means originally; he was the fountain of life, and
   still he keeps it in his own hands, and conveys it to all creatures
   every moment, even to the lowest worm: John v. 26, For as the Father
   hath life in himself, so hath he given to the Son to have life in
   himself.' The power of quickening and keeping of life belongs to God.
   He hath it originally from himself, he gives it to others, 1 Tim. vi.
   13. He that quickeneth all things, worms, men, that gives life to them,
   is God.

   3. Accept this grace in and through Jesus Christ, who hath purchased it
   for us, who, gave his flesh to be meat indeed, and his blood drink
   indeed,' John vi. 55; who rose again that we should walk in newness of
   life.' Rom. vi. 4; who ascended to pour out the spirit upon us, John
   vii. 38, 39, Therefore, when we find deadness spiritually, look to
   receive this life from Christ.

   4. Rouse up yourselves. There are considerations and arguments to
   quicken us. Certainly a man hath power and faculty to work truths upon
   himself, to stir up the gift and grace that is in us, 2 Tim. i. 6. We
   must not think grace works necessarily as fire burns, whether we will
   or not that this will enliven us; but we must rouse and stir up
   ourselves, as Ps. xlii. 5. There are many considerations by which we
   may awaken our own soul; from the love of God, from the hopes of glory;
   by which Christians should stir and keep their spirits awake and alive
   to wards God and heavenly things.

   Use 3. If quickening be so necessary, it presseth us to see whenever we
   have received anything of the vitality of grace. Sense, appetite, and
   activity, we may know it by these things: When there is a sense of sin
   indwelling as a burden--life is strong then when it would expel its
   enemy, Rom. vii. 24--when there is an appetite after Christ and his
   graces and comforts. When there is a greater activity, a bursting and
   breaking forth towards religious duties, it is a sign grace is strong
   in the heart; for the Spirit is to be a fountain of living waters
   always breaking out, John vii. 38. When we are more fruitful towards
   God, when it is ready to discover itself for the glory of God, then the
   heavenly life is kept in good plight. For these things we should be
   thankful to God, for he it is that awakeneth you.

   There is a twofold salvation--temporal and eternal.

   1. Temporal salvation is deliverance from temporal dangers: Exod. xiv.
   13, Stand still and see the salvation of the Lord.'

   2. Eternal deliverance from hell and wrath, together with that positive
   blessedness which is called eternal life: Heb. v. 9, And being made
   perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation to all them that
   obey him.' The text is applicable to both, though possibly the former
   principally intended.

   First, I shall apply it to salvation temporal, or deliverance out of
   trouble. There observe--

   1. The cause of it, Thy mercies.' God's children often fall into such
   straits that nothing but mercy can help them out. All deliverance is
   the fruit of mercy pitying our misery, but some deliverance especially
   is the fruit of mercy pardoning our sin, I shall give you some special
   cases, both as to danger and sin.

   [1.] In all cases as to danger, it is mercy which appears, partly
   because God's great argument to move him is the misery of his people.
   It is his great argument: Deut. xxxii. 36, The Lord will repent for his
   people;' when he seeth that all their power is gone, and none shut up
   and left, no manner of defence, but exposed as a prey to those that
   have a mind to wrong them. It is the only argument: Ps. lxxix. 8, Let
   thy tender mercies speedily prevent us, for we are brought very low.'
   Mercy relents towards a sinful people, when they are a wasted people.
   Partly because when there are no other means to help, mercy
   unexpectedly findeth out means for us. We are at an utter loss in
   ourselves; God finds out means of relief for us: Ps. lvii. 3, He shall
   send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of him that would
   swallow me up, Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and truth.' When
   we want help on earth, faith seeketh for help from heaven, and mercy
   chooseth means for us when we cannot pitch upon anything that may do us
   good. In these cases doth mercy discover itself as to danger.

   [2.] More eminently in special cases, when their sins have evidently
   brought them into those straits. Many afflictions are the strokes of
   God's immediate hand, or the common effects of his providence
   permitting the malice of men for our trial and exercise; but some are
   the proper effects of our own sins. We run ourselves into
   inconveniences by our folly, and even then mercy findeth a way of
   escape for us. Two ways may our sin be said to bring our trouble upon
   us meritoriè et effectivè.

   (1.) Meritoriè, when some judgment treadeth upon the heels of some
   foregoing sin and provocation; as David, when he had offended in the
   matter of Uriah, see Ps. iii. title, A Psalm of David when he fled from
   Absalom his son,' and the two first verses, Lord, how are they
   increased that trouble me? Many are they that rise up against me; many
   there be that say of my soul, There is no help for him in God, Selah.'
   David was deserted of his own subjects, chased from his palace and
   royal seat by his own son, Absalom. He had defiled Uriah's wife
   secretly, and his wives were defiled in the face of all Israel, and he
   driven to wander up and down for safety. God will make all that behold
   the scandalous sins of his people see what it is to provoke him to
   wrath. See how he complains, ver. 1, Lord, how are they increased that
   trouble me? Many are they that rise up against me.' You shall find in 2
   Sam. xv. 12, The people increaseth continually with Absalom;' a
   multitude against him, and the rest durst not be for him, their hearts
   were hovering. And in another place, 2 Sam. xvii. 11, all Israel
   gathered to him from Dan to Beersheba. In what a sorry plight was David
   when all was against him, and the world thought God was against him!
   for so it followeth, ver. 2, Many there be which say of my soul, There
   is no help for him in God, Selah.' The world counted the case
   desperate, and insulted over him, now God hath left him; but they
   mistook fatherly correction for vindicative justice. This was a sad
   condition; but David goeth to God to fetch him off; though he had drawn
   this judgment upon himself, yet he deals with him for relief: in such
   cases mercy is seen. That pit must be very deep when the line of grace
   doth not go to the bottom of it. In the face of the temptation David
   maintaineth his confidence in God: see ver. 3, But thou, O Lord, art my
   shield, my glory, and the lifter-up of my head.' God is counter-comfort
   to all his troubles. He was in danger, God was his shield; his kingdom
   was at stake, God was his glory: he was under sorrow and shame, God
   would lift up his head; to the unarmed a shield, to the disgraced
   glory, to the dejected an encourager or the lifter-up of his head. Thus
   when his case was thought desperate doth mercy work for him.

   (2.) Effectivè, when we ourselves run into the snare, and be holden
   with the cords of our own vanity: Prov. v. 22, His own iniquities shall
   take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his
   sins;' when we have been playing about the cockatrice's hole, and have
   brought mischief upon ourselves. Sometimes God's children have been
   guilty of this; they have been the cause of their own troubles; as
   David, when his unbelief drove him to Gath, where he was in danger of
   his life, and escaped by his dissembling: Ps. xxxiv., entitled, A
   Prayer of David when he changed his behaviour before Abimelech, who
   drove him away, and he departed.' And Josiah put himself on a war
   against Pharaoh Necho, and other such instances. Then if they be saved,
   it is certainly mercy.

   Again, observe, it is not mercy, but mercies; the expression is
   plural--

   [1.] To note the plenty and perfection of this attribute in God. God is
   very merciful to poor creatures. See in how many notions God's mercy is
   represented to us. A distinct consideration of them yieldeth an
   advantage in believing; for though they express the same thing, yet
   every notion begetteth a fresh thought, by which mercy is more taken
   abroad in the view of conscience. This is that pouring out God's name
   spoken of Cant. i. 3, Thy name is as ointment poured forth.' Ointment
   in the box doth not yield such a fragrancy as when it is poured out.
   God hath proclaimed his name: Exod. xxxiv. 6, The Lord, the Lord God,
   merciful and gracious, long-suffering, abundant in goodness and truth.'
   God hath given this description of himself, and the saints often take
   notice of it: Ps. ciii. 8, The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to
   anger, and of great kindness;' Joel ii. 13, Turn to the Lord your God,
   for he is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and of great kindness,
   and repenteth him of the evil;' Jonah iv. 2, I knew that thou wert a
   gracious God, slow to anger, and of great kindness;' and in divers
   other places. What doth the Spirit of God aim at in this^ express
   enumeration and accumulation of names of mercy, but to give us a help
   in meditation, and to enlarge our apprehensions of God's mercy? (1.)
   The first notion is mercy, which is an attribute whereby God inclineth
   to favour them that are in misery: it is a name God hath taken with
   respect to us; the love of God first falleth upon himself. God loveth
   himself, but he is not merciful to himself; mercy respects creatures in
   misery. Justice seeks a fit object; mercy, a fit occasion. Justice
   looketh to what is deserved; mercy, to what is wanted and needed.

   (2.) The next notion is grace, which noteth the free bounty of God, and
   excludeth all means on the creature's part. Grace doth all gratis,
   freely, though there be no precedent debt or obligation, or hope of
   recompense, whereby anything can accrue to God. His external motive is
   our misery, his internal motive his own grace. Angels, that never
   sinned, are saved merely out of grace. Men, that were once miserable,
   are saved, not only out of grace, but out of mercy.

   (3.) The next notion is long-suffering or slowness to anger. The Lord
   is not easily overcome by the wrongs or sins of the creature. He doth
   not only pity our misery--that is mercy, and do us good for
   nothing--that is grace, but beareth long with our infirmities--that is
   slowness to anger. Certainly he is easily appeased, and is hardly drawn
   to punish. Men are ready to anger, slow to mercy, quickly inflamed, and
   hardly appeased; but it is quite the contrary with God. It is good to
   observe the difference between God and man. Man cannot make anything of
   a sudden, but destroyeth it in an instant. When men are to make
   anything, they are long about it, as building a house is a long work;
   but plucking it down and undermining it is done in a short time. But
   God is quick in making, slow in destroying; he made the world in six
   days. He could have done it in a moment, were it not that he would give
   us a pattern of labour and order in all things. Now it hath continued
   for six thousand years, and upwards, as some account. Such is his
   longsuffering. How many of us has God borne with for ten, twenty,
   thirty years, from childhood to grey hairs, from the cradle to the
   grave! The angels were not endured in their sinful state, but
   immediately cast into hell.

   (4.) Kindness and bounty; he is plenteous in goodness. God is good and
   doth good; his communications to the creature are free and full, as the
   sun giveth out light and the fountain water. Thus you gee reason why
   mercies are plurally expressed.

   [2.] The frequency of it: Lam. iii. 23, His mercies are new every
   morning;' that is, renewed; those that concern the body and soul: not
   only merciful in saving once or twice, but every day pardoneth our new
   sins, and giveth to his repenting children new comforts. There is a
   throne of grace open every day, not once a year, Heb. iv. 16, as it was
   to the high priest under the law. The golden sceptre is daily held out,
   the fountain is ever open, not stopped up nor drawn dry. God keepeth
   not terms, but keepeth a court of audience; and every day we may come
   and sue out our pardon, and take out the comforts we stand in need of.

   [3.] The variety of our necessities, both by reason of misery and sin;
   go that not mercy, but mercies, will do us good. We have not one sin,
   but many; not one misery, but many; therefore mercies are needful to
   us.

   (1.) Our miseries are many, danger waylayeth us on every side;
   therefore the mercy of God is said to compass us about: Ps. xxxii. 10,
   He that trusteth in the Lord, mercy shall compass him about.' On which
   side soever temptation and trouble maketh the assault, mercy is ready
   to make the defence: Many are the troubles of the righteous, but the
   Lord delivereth them out of them all,' Ps. xxxiv. 19. Their troubles
   are many, from God's own hand, Satan's temptations, malice of the
   wicked world; therefore Let thy mercies come to me.'

   (2.) Our sins, so many provocations, transgressions from the womb, Isa.
   xlviii. 8. After grace received we have our failings; there remains
   much venom and evil of sin: Ps. li. 1, Have mercy upon me according to
   the greatness of thy mercy; according to the multitude of thy tender
   mercy blot out my transgressions;' where great sins, great mercies;
   many sins, many mercies. In that one fact how many ways did he sin? No
   great sin can be committed alone, but one evil act draweth on another,
   as links in a chain: adultery, blood; and this by a king, whose duty it
   was to punish it in others. The more above the stroke of man's justice,
   the more liable to God's. This when he had many wives of his own. A
   crime committed out of want is not so heinous as that committed out of
   wantonness. He took the poor man's one ewe lamb, when he had many
   flocks and herds. This was done not suddenly and in the heat of
   passion, but in cool blood, plotting his opportunities, abusing Uriah,
   his simplicity and sincerity, to his own destruction. His honesty in
   not returning to his house should have been a check upon David. He
   maketh him drunk; drew Joab into the conspiracy and confederacy of his
   guilt; many perished with Uriah in the attempt upon Rabbah.

   [4.] The many favours to be bestowed upon us, as food, clothing,
   protection, liberty in our service, and after all eternal life;
   therefore mercies, which giveth us all things necessary to life and
   godliness,' 2 Peter i. 3.

   2. The effect, thy salvation,' brought about in God's way, and upon
   God's terms. In temporal safety we must wait for God's salvation, such
   as God giveth, God alloweth. Better be miserable than be saved upon
   other terms. Many would be safe from troubles, but they would take
   their own way, and so turn aside to crooked paths. Those martyrs spoken
   of in the Hebrews, chap. xi. 35, would not accept deliverance, that
   they might obtain a better resurrection;' to wince under trouble, and
   fling off the burden ere it be taken off by God without any sin of
   ours; otherwise we break prison, get out by the window, not by the
   door. We must take up our cross as long as God will please to have us
   bear it. David saith, Thy salvation.'

   3. The warrant and ground of his expectation, According to thy word.'
   God's mercy is to be expected according to the tenor of the promise.
   How is that?

   [1.] No temporal blessing is absolutely to be expected, for God hath
   reserved the liberty of trying and chastising his children in outward
   things. The covenant is to be understood with the exception of the
   cross, and we can have no temporal benefit by it but as it is useful
   for us: Ps. lxxxix. 32, 33, I will visit their transgression with a
   rod, and their iniquity with stripes: nevertheless my loving-kindness
   will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.'
   God will use medicinal discipline, though not satisfy his justice upon
   them.

   [2.] The qualification of the promise must be regarded by those that
   would have benefit by it. God's covenant is made with his people; it is
   a mutual stipulation. Many would have comfort; we plead promises of
   safety with God, but forget promises of obedience to him; as Ephraim
   would tread out the corn, but not break the clods, Hosea x. 11. There
   was food: Deut. xxv. 4, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox which treadeth out
   the corn.' We mind our own interest more than God's honour.

   [3.] A word of promise calleth for faith and trust. Whatever
   contrariety appeareth in God's providence, God's word must bear up our
   hearts; it is as a pawn till the deliverance come. God's mercy is the
   same still; his word calleth for trust. The more we trust and hope in
   his mercy the better for us: Ps. xiii. 5, I have trusted in thy mercy;
   my soul shall rejoice in thy salvation;' Ps. xxxiii. 22, Let thy mercy,
   O Lord, be upon us, as we hope in thee;' and Ps. xxxii. 10, He that
   trusteth in the Lord, mercy shall compass him about.' The more clear is
   your claim when you trust yourselves with him. He is a merciful God,
   and his word saith he will take care for them that fear him.

   [4.] All this trust must be set awork in prayer; so doth David, and so
   saith the word: Ps. 1. 15, Call upon me in the day of trouble; I will
   deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify my name;' Jer. xxix. 11, 12, I
   know the thoughts that I think towards you, saith the Lord; thoughts of
   peace and not of evil, to give you an expected end. Then shall ye call
   upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto
   you;' Ezek. xxxvi. 37, Thus saith the Lord God, I will yet for this be
   inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them.'

   4. The effectual application, Let thy mercies come also unto me.'

   [1.] He beggeth application: unto me also.' God is every day scattering
   his mercies abroad in the world, and David would not be left out of
   God's care and blessed provision, but have his share also. Esau's words
   are applicable upon this occasion: Gen. xxvii. 38, Hast thou but one
   blessing, O my Father? Bless me, even me also.' When the earth is full
   of his goodness, beg your share. God is the Father of mercies; he hath
   not the less for bestowing, as the sun hath not less light for us
   because others enjoy it with us. God doth not waste by giving.

   [2.] He beggeth an effectual application, Let thy mercies come unto
   me.' The way was blocked up with sins and difficulties, yet mercy could
   clear all, and find access to him, or make out its way. Let it come to
   me, that is, let it be performed or come to pass, as it is rendered,
   Judges xiii. 12, Now let thy words come to pass to us;' Heb.--Let it
   come; here let it come home to me, for my comfort and deliverance.
   David elsewhere saith, Ps. xxiii. 6, Mercy and goodness shall follow me
   all my days;' go after him, find him out in his wanderings. So Ps.
   cxvi. 12, What shall I render to the Lord for all his benefits towards
   me?' They found their way to him though shut up with sins and dangers.
   Thus we see how to plead with God for temporal salvation; we must make
   grace, and nothing but grace, the ground of our hope, and this
   according to the tenor of the word.

   Secondly, As it is applicable to eternal salvation; and then--

   1. The ground of all is mercy, or pity of the creatures' misery. The
   Lord is not moved to bestow grace upon sinners for any goodness that he
   findeth in them, or could foresee in them, for he findeth none, and
   could foresee nothing but what was the fruit of his own grace: Rom. xi.
   35, Who hath given him first, and it shall be recompensed unto him
   again?' It is the honour of God to begin all things, as the river
   floweth all to the fountain, the fountain nothing to the river; as none
   can give him first, so none can be profitable unto him, for he needeth
   nothing: Acts xvii. 25, Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as
   though he needed anything, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath,
   and all things.' Nay, we deserve the contrary, to be cast into utter
   darkness: Ezek. xxxvi. 21, 22, I do not this for your sakes: I had pity
   for my name's sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen;' 1 Peter
   i. 3, Of his abundant goodness he hath begotten us to a lively hope.'
   We have not a right notion of mercy unless we admire the plenty of it:
   Eph. ii. 4, God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love where with he
   loved us, when we were dead in trespasses and sins, hath quickened us
   with Christ.' There need many mercies from first to last for the saving
   of a poor sinner; their natural misery is great: Ezek. xvi. 6, When I
   passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto
   thee, when thou wast in thy blood, Live; yea, I said unto thee, when
   thou wast in thy blood, Live.' Their actual sins many: Jer. xiv. 7, Our
   iniquities testify against us.' The way of their recovery by Christ is
   mysterious: John iii. 16, God so loved the world, that he gave his
   only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,
   but have everlasting life.' The course taken for satisfying wronged
   justice; the application involveth many mercies. The renewing of their
   natures: Titus iii. 5, According to his mercy he saved us, by the
   washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghost.' The
   preserving of inherent grace against temptations, forgiving many sins
   after conversion: Isa. lv. 7, Let the wicked for sake his way, and the
   unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he
   will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly
   pardon;' Prov. xxiv. 16, The righteous fall seven times a day, and
   riseth up again.' The great eternal good things to be bestowed on them:
   Jude 21, Looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal
   life.' So that from first to last there is nothing but a concatenation
   of mercies.

   2. The effect, salvation. This properly deserveth to be called so. We
   are saved but in part before, then from all evils, from the greatest
   evil, hell. Before we are saved, but we maybe troubled again. Now no
   more sorrow, when all opposition is broken, and God is all in all, and
   the church presented as a prey snatched out of the teeth of lions; all
   former things are done away.

   3. This dispensed according to the word. Now what doth the word say?
   When a sinner repenteth, all the iniquities which he hath committed
   shall be forgotten. There is abuse of mercy noted: Deut. xxix. 19, If
   he shall bless himself and say, I shall have peace though I walk in the
   imagination of my heart;' I may go on in sin and cry God a mercy, and
   there is an end. No; mercy issueth out itself for salvation of men
   according to the word; these are conclusions contrary to grace: Jude 4,
   There are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old
   ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our
   God into lasciviousness.' The principle is true, but the conclusion is
   false. Certainly God is merciful, there is no end nor measure nor bank
   nor bottom in his mercy; but throughout the whole scriptures mercy is
   only promised to the penitent, and those that come to God by Christ.
   Take mercy according to the word, according to the analogy of faith,
   and there is not a more powerful incentive of duty: Ps. cxxx. 5, There
   is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared;' Titus ii. 11,
   12, The grace of God, that bringeth salvation, hath appeared to all
   men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should
   live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world;' Rom. xii.
   1, I beseech you, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present
   your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your
   reasonable service.' This is true divinity. The flesh deviseth another
   doctrine. Let us sin that grace may abound, to make a carnal pillow of
   God's mercy, that they may sleep securely in sin, yea, a dungcart to
   carry away their filth. God is merciful, but to those that count sin a
   burden and misery; God is slow to anger, but yet angry when provoked:
   abused patience kindleth into fury, as water, when the mouth of the
   fountain or course of the river is stopped, breaketh out with more
   violence. God hath his arrows of displeasure to shoot at the wicked.
   You must not fancy a God all honey, all sweetness; he is the father of
   mercies,' but so that he is also a God of vengeance:' Ps. lxviii.
   19-21, Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even
   the God of our salvation, Selah. He that is our God is the God of
   salvation; and unto God the Lord belong the issues from death. But God
   shall wound the hairy scalp of his enemies.' The mercy of God is large
   and free, if men do not make themselves incapable by their impenitency.

   4. We must beg--(1.) The application of these: to me also:' We have
   heard that the kings of Israel are merciful kings,' 1 Kings xx. 31. Now
   we would feel it: 1 Tim. i. 15, This is a faithful saying, and worthy
   of all acceptation, that Jesus Christ came into the world to save
   sinners, of whom I am chief.' Wind in ourselves within the covert of a
   promise, enter at the back-door of a promise; there comes virtue from
   Christ if but touched. The woman came behind him and touched the hem of
   his garment; so we must seek the application of this virtue. (2.)
   Effectual application, Let it come unto me.' Mercy cometh unto us, or
   we shall never come unto it, 1 Peter i. 10. The grace that cometh to
   us, cha'rin erchome'nen, the grace which is brought to you at the
   revelation of Jesus Christ, God's grace, is brought home to our doors;
   we seek not after it, but it seeketh after us. Salvation has gone
   forth, saith the prophet, to find out lost sinners: Wisdom hath sent
   forth her maidens: she crieth upon the high places of the city, Whoso
   is simple, let him turn in hither,' Prov. ix. 3, 4. God sends the
   gospel up and down the world to offer his grace to men; it worketh out
   its way.

   Use. Here is encouragement and direction to poor creatures how to
   obtain God's mercy for their comfort.

   1. Encouragement. Mercy doth all with God; it is the first cause, that
   setteth every thing awork.

   [1.] Mercy is natural to God: 2 Cor. i. 3, Father of mercies.' God is
   not merciful by accident, but by nature; the sun doth not more
   naturally shine, nor fire more naturally burn, nor water more naturally
   flow, than God doth naturally show mercy.

   [2.] It is pleasing to him: Micah vii. 18, Who is a God like unto thee,
   that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the
   remnant of his heritage? He retaineth not his anger for ever, because
   he delighteth in mercy.' Judgment is called his strange work,' Isa.
   xxviii. 21, That he may do his work, his strange work, and bring to
   pass his act, his strange act.' Primitive [16] acts he is forced to,
   but he rejoiceth to do good, as live honey droppeth of its own accord.

   [3.] It is plentiful in God; he is rich in mercy, abundant in goodness
   truth. Thy sins are like a spark of fire that falleth into the ocean;
   it is quenched presently. So are all thy sins in the ocean of God's
   mercy; there is not more water in the sea than there is mercy in God.

   [4.] It is the great wonder of the divine nature. Everything in God is
   wonderful, especially his pardoning mercy. It is no such great wonder
   in God that he stretcheth out the heavens like a curtain, since he is
   omni potent; that he formed the earth or the waters, since he is
   strong; that he distinguished times, adorned the heavens with so many
   stars, decked the earth with such variety of plants and herbs, since he
   is wise; that he hath set bounds to the sea, governeth the waters,
   since he is Lord of all; that he made man a living creature, since he
   is the fountain of life; but that he can be merciful to sinners,
   infinitely merciful when infinitely just. There is a conflict in the
   attributes about us, but mercy rejoiceth over judgment,' James ii. 13;
   that he is so gracious and condescending, when his first covenant
   seemed to bind him to destroy us; that he that hateth sin is so ready
   to forgive it, pardoneth it so often, and punisheth it so seldom.

   [5.] He is communicative; it is over all his works,' Ps. cxlv. 9. Not a
   creature but subsisteth by God's mercy; he loveth man and beast, Ps.
   xxxvi. 6; and 1 Tim. iv. 10, He is the saviour of all men, especially
   of those that believe.' The whole earth is full of his goodness: Lord,
   show it to me also. He heareth the cry of the ravens.'

   2. To direct us how to sue for it in a broken-hearted manner. There-are
   two extremes--self-confidence and desperation. Self-confidence
   challengeth a debt, and despair shutteth out hopes of mercy. A proud
   Pharisee pleads his works, Luke xviii. 11. Cain saith, Gen. iv. 13, My
   punishment is greater that I can bear.' The middle between, both is the
   penitent publican: Luke xviii. 13, He stood afar off, and would not
   lift up so much as his eyes to heaven, but smote his breast, saying,
   God, be merciful to me a sinner.' Go to him; that which with men is the
   worst plea, with God is the best.

SERMON XLVIII.

   So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I
   trust in thy word.--Ver. 42.

   IN the former verse we saw the man of God begging for deliverance, or
   temporal salvation, from the mercies of God according to his word.
   Salvation belongeth to the Lord, and his mercy can pardon great sins,
   and fetch us off from great extremities, and that according to the word
   of God. He had boasted of this. There is his request; here is his
   argument, from the use and fruit of his deliverance; he should have
   some thing to reply to the scoffs and mocks of wicked men, who insulted
   over him in his distress and calamity. He had spoken of great things or
   the promise, [17] and now desireth the promise to be made good, that he
   might have an answer ready against their reproaches, So shall I have
   wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me.'

   But hath a child of God nothing to answer to a wicked man before
   salvation cometh? Ans. Yes; a child of God could answer them of the
   principles of faith; but they must have instances of sense. He could
   say that his God is in heaven, and doth whatsoever he pleaseth;' that
   he is the shield of his help, and sword of his excellency,' Deut.
   xxxiii. 29. Weapons offensive and defensive enough yet left; but the
   business is not what is an answer in itself, but what answer will
   satisfy them? for they that have no faith must be taught by sense. When
   we urge principles of faith, unless their senses hear, feel, see, they
   will not regard them. Then their mouths are stopped when God doth own
   his people from heaven. They count faith a foolish persuasion, hope a
   vain expectation, and inward supports and comforts fantastical
   impressions; as if men did feed themselves with the wind. But God's
   salvation would answer for him, and some sensible providences be a real
   confutation.

   Observe three things:--

   1. The ground of David's comfort, I trust in thy word.

   2. The enemy's insultation thereupon, intimated in these words, him
   that reproacheth me. They scoffed at his trust in God, as if he would
   not bear him out in his strictness.

   3. The request of the Psalmist, that God would confute and stop their
   mouths by making good his promises to him, so shall I have wherewith to
   answer him. Points:--

   Doct. 1. It is our duty to trust God upon his word.

   Doct. 2. Those that do so must look to be reproached for it.

   Doct. 3. God making good his promises confuteth their reproaches and
   insultations.

   Doct. 4. God will therefore make them good, and his people may expect
   and beg deliverance to that end.

   Doct. 1. It is our duty to trust God upon his word. The act of trust is
   spoken of with respect to a twofold object--the word and God; the one
   more properly noteth the warrant of faith, the other the object. Both
   are mentioned together, John xvii. 20, Neither pray I for these alone,
   but for them also which shall believe on me through their word.' In
   other places sometimes one is mentioned, sometimes the other; trusting
   in God and trusting in the word of God; but whenever the one is
   mentioned the other is included. To trust in God without his word is a
   foolish and groundless presumption, and the word without God is but a
   dead letter. It is not the conveyances merely that a man liveth upon,
   but the lands conveyed by them.

   First, What is this trusting in God?

   Ans. An exercise of faith, whereby, looking upon God in Christ through
   the promises, we depend upon him for whatsoever we stand in need of,
   and so are encouraged to go on cheerfully in the ways wherein he hath
   appointed us to walk. It is a fruit of faith, and supposeth it planted
   in the heart, for an act cannot be without a habit. I suppose a man to
   have this grace before I require the exercise of it. And it looketh
   upon God in Christ as the fountain of blessings, for otherwise God, to
   the fallen creature, is not an object of trust, but horror; as the
   devils believe and tremble,' James ii. 19; and that may be the reason
   why the sons of men are said to put their trust under the shadow of his
   wings:' Ps. xxxvi. 7, How excellent is thy lovingkindness, God!
   Therefore the children of men shall put their trust under the shadow of
   thy wings;' and Ps. lvii. 1, My soul trusteth in thee, yea, in the
   shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities be
   overpast.' In which there is supposed to be an allusion not only to the
   feathers of a hen spread over the chickens, but the out-stretched wings
   of the cherubim over the mercy-seat, which was a type of Christ, who is
   therefore called ilaste'rion, a propitiation, as also the mercy-seat,
   Heb. v. 8, with Rom. iii. 24, Being justified freely by his grace,
   through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ, whom God hath set forth
   to be a propitiation through faith in his blood.' The mercy-seat, or
   God offering himself to be reconciled in Christ, is an open sanctuary
   for distressed souls to fly unto. This doth draw our hearts to him
   through the promises. These are the holdfast which we have upon God,
   the sacred bands which he has taken upon himself, the rule and warrant
   of faith which shows how far God is to be trusted. Our necessities lead
   us to the promises, and the promises to Christ, and Christ to God, as
   the fountain of grace; and therefore we put these bonds in suit; we
   turn them into prayers; and then we have free leave to challenge him
   upon his word: Ps. cxix. 99, Remember thy word unto thy servant,
   wherein thou hast caused me to hope.' Therefore, to bear up our hearts,
   God hath not only promised us, in the general, that he will never fail
   us nor forsake us,' Heb. xiii. 5, And all things shall work together
   for good.' Rom. viii. 28; that he will be with us in fire and water,
   Isa. xliii. 2, and that he will be a sun and a shield, and give us
   grace and glory, and no good thing will he withhold,' Ps. lxxxiv. 11;
   but also, in particular, hath multiplied and suited his promises to all
   our necessities, that when we come to the throne of grace we may have a
   promise ready. A general intimation is not so clear a ground of hope as
   a particular and express promise: the more of these we have, the more
   explicit are our thoughts about God's protection, and the more are our
   hearts fortified and borne up in praying to him and waiting upon him.
   Chirographa tua injiciebat tibi, Domine--whose are these? Lay up his
   words in thy heart, Job xxii. 22. The more of these the more arguments
   in prayer. We depend upon him for all that we stand in need of. Herein
   is the nature of trust seen, in dependence and reliance upon God, that
   he will supply our wants in a way most conducible to his glory and our
   good. Now, this depending on God must be done at all times, especially
   in a time of straits and difficulties. At all times: Ps. lxii. 8, Trust
   in the Lord at all times.' It is an act never out of season, but
   especially in a time of fears, misery, and distress: Ps. lvi. 3, At
   what time I am afraid, I will put my trust in thee.' In prosperity and
   adversity we are to depend upon God, and to make use of him in all
   conditions: Ps. xci. 9, Thou shalt make the Most High thy refuge, and
   my God thine habitation.' A refuge is a place of retreat and safety in
   a time of war, and a habitation the place of our abode in a time of
   peace. Whatever our condition be, our dependence must be on God. When
   all things are prosperous, God must be owned as the fountain of our
   blessings, all our comforts taken out of his hand, and that we hold all
   by his mercy and bountiful providence. Because of our forfeiture by
   sin, and the uncertainty of these outward comforts, and the continual
   necessity of his providential influence and support, the heart must
   still be exercised in the acknowledgment of God and his gracious hand
   over us; and so the heart is not enticed by our outward comforts, but
   raised by them. Indeed, in some cases, it is harder to trust God with
   means than without. When there are visible means of supply, the heart
   is prone to carnal confidence. Good Paul was in danger: 2 Cor. i. 9, We
   had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in
   ourselves, but in God, which raiseth the dead.' But then in adversity,
   when kept bare and low, then is a time to show trust; how hard soever
   our condition be, grounds of confidence are not lost: Zeph. iii. 12, I
   will leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they
   shall trust in the name of the Lord.' Every man thinketh trusting in
   God easy when things go well with him; but indeed he trusteth in other
   things; he eateth his own meat, and weareth his own apparel, only God
   carrieth the name of it. But now, when we are without all comfort and
   encouragement from the creatures, as David, when he was left alone,
   Refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul: I cried unto thee, O Lord,
   and said, Thou art my refuge and portion in the land of the living,'
   Ps. cxlii. 4, 5. When men fail, God never faileth; when riches take
   wing, and worldly friends forsake us, then is a time for trust and
   dependence upon God. It is the end of providence that we should have
   the less comfort in the creature that we may have all in God. Now we
   are to depend on God for whatsoever we stand in need of, as at all
   times, so for all things, temporal and spiritual mercies; for God will
   withhold no good thing from us. He hath undertaken not only to give us
   heaven and happiness in the next world, but to carry us thither with
   comfort, that we may serve him without fear all the days of our lives,'
   Luke i. 75. His providence concerneth the outward and inward man, and
   so do his promises. A whole believer is in covenant with God, body and
   soul, and he will take care of both. But all the difficulty is how we
   ought to depend on him for temporal supplies.

   1. It is certain that we ought not to set God a task to provide meat
   for our lusts: Ps. lxxviii. 18, And they tempted God in their heart by
   asking meat for their lusts.' Carnal affections and hopes do but make
   trouble for ourselves. Though it be the ordinary practice of God's free
   grace and fatherly cares to provide things comfortable and necessary
   for his children, whilst he hath work for them to do, yet he never
   undertook to maintain us at such a rate, to give us so much by the
   year, such portions for our children, and supplies for our families. We
   must leave to the great Shepherd of the sheep to choose our pastures,
   bare or large; and he that will depend upon God must be sure to empty
   his heart of covetous desires, and be contented with our lot, if we
   would cast ourselves upon his providence: Heb. xiii. 5, Let your
   conversation be without covetousness, and be content with such things
   as you have; for he hath said, I will never leave thee nor for sake
   thee.' We do but ensnare and perplex our own thoughts while we would
   reconcile the promises with our lusts, and crave more than ever God
   meaneth to give.

   2. It is as certain that we ought not to be faithless and full of cares
   about these outward supplies: Mat. vi. 23, Take no thought what ye
   shall eat, or what ye shall drink, or wherewithal ye shall be clothed;'
   because, if we had no promises, there is a common bounty and goodness
   of God which is over all his works, and reacheth to the preservation of
   the smallest worm, decketh the lilies, feedeth the ravens and the fowls
   of the air; and certainly more noble creatures, such as men are, may
   expect their share in this common bounty; how much more when there is a
   covenant wherein God hath promised to be a father to us, and temporal
   blessings are adopted and taken into the covenant as well as other
   blessings. Will not he give that to children which he gives to enemies,
   to beasts and fowls of the air? You would count him a barbarous and
   unnatural father that feeds his dogs and hawks, and lets his children
   die of hunger; and can we without blasphemy think so of God?

   3. As we ought not, on the one hand, to think God will supply our
   lusts, nor, on the other hand, distrust his care of necessaries, so we
   cannot be absolutely confident of particular success in temporal
   things; for they are not absolutely promised, but with exception of the
   cross, and as God shall see them good for us. God reserved in the
   covenant a liberty both of showing his justice and his wisdom; his
   justice, in scourging his sinning people: Ps. lxxxix. 32, He will visit
   their iniquity with rods, and their transgression with scourges.' The
   world shall know God doth not allow sins in his own children. Sin is as
   odious to God in them as others, yea, more; and therefore they feel the
   smart of it. The liberty of his wisdom: Ps. lxxxiv. 11, The Lord God is
   a sun and a shield: the Lord will give grace and glory, and no good
   thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly;' Ps. xxxiv. 9,
   10, O fear the Lord, ye his saints, for there is no want to them that
   fear him: the young lions do lack and suffer hunger, but they that fear
   the Lord shall not want any good thing.' They may want many comforts,
   but no good thing. Good is not determined by our fancies, but God's
   wisdom. Well, then, we cannot expect a certain tenure of temporal
   happiness-; there is great danger in fixing a deceitful hope; much of
   the subtlety of Satan is to be seen in it, who maketh an advantage of
   our disappointments, and abuseth our rash confidence into a snare and
   temptation to atheism and the misbelief of other truths.

   4. The dependence we exercise about these things lieth in committing
   ourselves to God's power, and referring ourselves to God's will. He is
   so able that he can secure us in his work, so good, that we should not
   trouble ourselves about his will, but refer it to him without
   hesitancy, which, if we could bring our hearts to it, it would ease us
   of many burdensome thoughts and troublesome cares: 1 Peter iv. 19,
   Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the
   keeping of their souls to him in well-doing, as unto a faithful
   Creator;' Prov. xvi. 3, Commit thy ways unto the Lord, and thy thoughts
   shall be established.' Put yourselves into God's hands, so trusting him
   with the issue of our affairs, though we know not how it will fall: 1
   Chron. xix. 13, Let the Lord do what is good in his sight;' 1 Tim. iv.
   10, Therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in
   the living God, who is the saviour of all men, especially of those that
   believe;' and so are encouraged to go on cheer fully with their duty.
   Trust in God is not idle expectation or a devout sloth, but such a
   dependence as giveth life to our service, that we may go on cheerfully,
   without disquiet in our work, and in ways wherein he hath appointed us
   to walk. The law gives protection to those that travel on the road, not
   in byways: He shall keep thee in all thy ways:' in viis, non in
   prcecipitiis. Otherwise you seek to draw God into a fellowship of your
   guilt, and do make him serve with your iniquities,' Isa. xliii. 24--he
   was doubly censured among the heathen that took a lamp from the altar
   to steal by--to make God's providence subservient to the devil's
   interest: 1 Peter iv. 19, Commit your souls to God in well-doing.' God
   never undertook to protect us in the devil's service.

   Secondly, Reasons why it is our duty.

   1. Trust, as it implieth recourse to God in our necessities, is
   necessarily required in the fundamental article of the covenant, in the
   choice of God for your God. Nature teacheth men in their distress to
   run to their gods: Jonah i. 5, The mariners cried every man to his
   god.' It immediately results from the owning of a God, that we should
   trust him with our safety; much more when taught thus to do, and how to
   do so in the word.

   2. Else there can be no converse with God. Truth is the ground of
   commerce between man and man; so our dependence, which is built upon
   God's fidelity, is the ground of commerce between God and us. Man fell
   from God by distrust, by having a jealousy of him; and still the evil
   heart of unbelief doth lead us off from God: Heb. iii. 12, Take heed,
   brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in
   departing from the living God.' But the more we believe him, the more
   we keep with him. God doth not give present payment, nor govern the
   world by sense; therefore faith is necessary: 2 Cor. v. 7, For we walk
   by faith, not by sight.' Sight is for heaven, faith for the present
   dispensation. We are now under sense, and that will mislead us. Reason
   is either refined by faith, or depressed by sense.

   3. Consider whose word it is. God's word is the signification of his
   will who is merciful, able, true. (1.) There is benignity and goodness,
   by which he is willing to help poor creatures, though we can be of no
   use and profit to him. The hen receiveth no benefit by the chickens,
   only her trouble of providing for them is increased; but they are her
   own brood, therefore she leadeth them up and down that they may find a
   sustenance: so doth God to the creatures. We are the work of his hands,
   therefore he pitieth us, and is willing to save us; and not only so,
   but carried us in the womb of his decree from all eternity. (2.) His
   truth and fidelity is laid at pawn with the creature in the promises:
   Ps. cxxxviii. 2, Thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.' He
   standeth much on his truth, is punctual in his promises. It is a great
   disgrace done to God if we do not trust him upon his word; we make him
   a liar:' 1 John v. 10, He that believeth not God hath made him a liar,'
   and so not God. (3.) He is able to make it good; his word never yet
   found difficulty: He spake the word, and it was done.' There is the
   same power that goeth still along with his word. If he say he will do
   this, who can let? Therefore, none that ever yet trusted in God were
   disappointed: Ps. xxii. 5, They trusted in thee, and were not
   confounded.'

   4. From the benefits of this trust.

   [1.] This fixeth and establisheth the heart against all fears, which so
   often prove a snare to us: Ps. cxii. 7, He shall not be afraid of evil
   tidings; his heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord.' Ill news and cross
   accidents falling out in the world do not dismay him, because he
   looketh higher, because he hath set God against men, the covenant
   against providences, eternal things against temporal; he is not
   fearless, yet his heart is established and fixed.

   [2.] It allayeth our sorrows, and maketh us cheerful in the midst of
   all difficulties and discouragements: Ps. xiii. 5, I have trusted in
   thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation;' so Ps. lii. 8, I
   am like a green olive-tree, for I trust in the mercy of God for ever
   and ever.' As some trees are green in winter; this will make a man
   flourish notwithstanding opposition, and all the bitter cold blasts of
   trouble and worldly distress.

   [3.] It quiets the heart as to murmurings and unquiet agitations of
   spirit, to wait God's leisure. When there was a storm in David's
   spirit, he allayeth it thus: Ps. xlii. 5, Why art thou disquieted, my
   soul? hope thou in God, for I shall yet praise him.' On the contrary,
   murmuring, impatience, and vexation is the fruit of distrust: Ps. cvi.
   24, 25, They believed not his word, and murmured in their tents.' They
   that distrust God's promise fall a quarrelling with his providence. Did
   we believe that the wise God is still carrying on all things for our
   good, we would submit to his will.

   [4.] It banisheth and removeth far from us distracting cares and fears;
   these are a great sin, a reproach to our heavenly Father: Mat. vi. 25,
   Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall
   eat, nor what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put
   on;' and ver. 32, After all these things do the Gentiles seek; for your
   heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.' As if
   your children, when you are able to maintain them, should distrust your
   allowance, and beg their bread from door to door. We are forecasting
   many things, take God's work out of his hands, and are anxious in
   inquiring what we shall eat, what we shall drink, what shall become of
   such a business and affair. Now, how shall we be eased of these
   tormenting thoughts? Prov. xvi. 3, Commit thy works unto the Lord, and
   thy thoughts shall be established;' 2 Chron. xx. 20, Believe in the
   Lord your God, so shall ye be established.'

   [5.] It keepeth us from warping and turning aside to crooked paths. As
   long as we are persuaded that God will maintain us by honest and lawful
   means, we are kept upright with God; but an unbelieving person makes
   haste; right or wrong, he will be his own carver. Men, if they have not
   faith enough to trust God in an ordinary course of providence, think
   God is a bad pay-master, and therefore take up with present things:
   Zeph. iii. 2, She obeyed not my voice, she trusted not in the Lord;'
   that was the reason of her corruption, oppression, and deceit; this was
   the reason why they rose up against Moses, and would go back to Egypt;
   they would not believe God could maintain them in the wilderness.
   Warping and declining from God cometh from want of faith.

   The first use is to persuade us to trust in God upon his word. I will
   direct you--

   1. As to the means.

   2. The nature of this trust.

   1. As to the means. If you would do so--

   [1.] Know him: Ps. ix. 10, They that know thy name will put their trust
   in thee.' If God were better known, he would be better trusted: 2 Tim.
   i. 12, I know whom I have believed.'

   [2.] Get a covenant interest in him. If our interest be clouded, how
   can we put promises in suit? But when it is clear, you may draw
   comfortable conclusions thence: Ps. xxxi. 14, I trusted in thee. O
   Lord; I said, Thou art my God;' Ps. xxiii. 1, The Lord is my shepherd,
   I shall not want;' he will provide for his own: Lam. iii. 24, 4 The
   Lord is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.'

   [3.] Walk closely with him: Micah iii. 11, The heads thereof judge for
   reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets
   thereof divine for money; yet will they lean upon the Lord, and say, Is
   not the Lord among us? None evil shall come upon us.' God will shake
   them as Paul did the viper. Shame, fear, and doubts do always follow
   sin. Will a man trust him whom he hath provoked? Doubts are the fumes
   of sin, like vapours that come from off a foul stomach. If we mean to
   make good and keep a friend, we will be careful to please him. A good
   conversation breedeth a good conscience, and a good conscience trust in
   God.

   [4.] Observe experiences, when he maketh good his word: Ps. xviii. 30,
   As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the Lord is tried; he is a
   buckler to all them that trust in him.' All these providences are
   confirmations that feed and nourish faith: Ps. lvi. 10, 11, In God will
   I praise his word; in the Lord will I praise his word: in God have I
   put my trust; I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.'

   2. As to the nature of this trust. Let me commend to you--

   [1.] The adventure of faith: Luke v. 5, At thy word we will let down
   the net.' At thy command; when we cannot apply the promise, venture for
   the command's sake; see what God will do for you, and what believing
   comes to.

   [2.] The waiting of faith, when expectation is not answered, and you
   find not at first what you wait for; yet do not give God the lie, but
   resolve to keep the promise as a pawn till the blessing promised
   cometh: Isa. xxviii. 16, He that believeth maketh not haste.' It is
   carnal affection must have present satisfaction: greedy and impatient
   longings argue a disease. Revenge must have it by and by; covetousness
   waxeth rich in a day; ambition would rise presently; lusts are earnest
   and ravenous; like diseased stomachs, must have green trash.

   [3.] The obstinacy and resolution of faith. Resolve to die holding the
   horns of the altar; you will not be put off; as she cried so much the
   more, and the woman of Canaan turned discouragements into arguments:
   Job xiii. 15, Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him.'

   [4.] The submission and resignation of faith: Mat. vi. 33, Seek ye
   first the kingdom of God, and the righteousness thereof, and all these
   things shall be added to you.' Set your hearts upon the highest
   interest, make sure of heaven, and refer other things to God; be at a
   point of indifferency for temporal supplies.

   [5.] The prudence of faith. Settle your mind against present
   necessities, and for future contingencies leave them to God's
   providence: Mat. vi. 34, Sufficient for each day is the evil thereof.'
   Children, that have to allay present hunger, do not cark how to bring
   the year about; they leave that to their father. Manna was to be
   gathered daily; when it was kept till the morning, it putrified.

   [6.] The obedience of faith. Mind duty, and let God take care of
   success. Let God alone with the issues of things, otherwise we take the
   work out of his hands. A Christian's care should be what he should be,
   not what shall become of him: Phil. iv. 6, Be careful for nothing;' and
   1 Peter v. 7, But cast your care on him, for he careth for you.' There
   is a care of duties and a care of events. God is more solicitous for
   you than you for yourselves.

   Use 2. Do we thus trust in the Lord? All will pretend to trust in God,
   but there is little of this true trusting in him in the world.

   1. If we trust God we shall be often with him in prayer, Ps. lxii. 8,
   Trust in the Lord at all times; pour out your hearts before him;' 2
   Sam. xxii. 2-4, The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer,
   the God of my rock; in him will I trust; he is my shield and the horn
   of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my Saviour; thou savest
   me from violence; I will call on the Lord, who is worthy to be praised;
   so shall I be saved from mine enemies.' We #ct our trust at the throne
   of grace; encourage ourselves in God.

   2. It will quiet and fix the heart, free it of cares, fears, and
   anxious thoughts: Phil. iv. 6, 7, Be careful for nothing, but in
   everything, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your
   request be made known unto God; and the peace of God, which passeth all
   understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds, through Jesus Christ;'
   Ps. xciv. 19, In the multitude of my thoughts within me, thy comforts
   delight my soul.'

   3. A care to please, for dependence begets observance. They that have
   all from God will not easily break with him.

   Doct. 2. Those that do trust in God must look to be reproached for it
   by carnal men.

   1. There are two sorts of men in the world ever since the
   beginning--contrary seeds: Gen. iii. 15, I will put enmity between thee
   and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed.' Some born of the
   flesh, some of the spirit; the seed of the woman and the seed of the
   serpent; some that live by sense, some by faith: ever it will be so.
   And there is an enmity between these two, and this enmity vented by
   reproach: Gal. iv. 29, But as he that was born after the flesh
   persecuted him that was born after the spirit, even so it is now;' that
   persecution was by bitter mockings. So Ishmael: Gen. xxi. 9, Sarah saw
   the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham,
   mocking.'

   2. The occasion, from their low condition; hence they will take liberty
   to mock at their interest in God, and to shame them from their
   confidence, as if the promise of God were of none effect. Carnal men
   measure all things by a carnal interest; and therefore the life of
   those that live by faith is ridiculous to them; those that trust in a
   promise are exercised with delay and distress: Heb. vi. 12, Be ye
   followers of them who, through faith and patience, have inherited the
   promises.' Here is matter for faith and patience. Now, they that know
   no arm but flesh, no security but a temporal interest, no happiness but
   in the things of this life, have them in derision that look elsewhere.

   Use 1. Not to count it strange when it is our lot to be exercised with
   reproaches because of our trust; so was Christ: Ps. xxii. 6-8, I am a
   worm, and no man, a reproach of men, and despised of the people: all
   they that see me laugh me to scorn; they shoot out the lip, and shake
   the head, saying, He trusted in the Lord that he would deliver him; let
   him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him;' Mat. xxvii. 39-43, And
   they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads, and saying, Thou
   that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save
   thyself; if thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross,' &c. If
   Christ Jesus was mocked for his trust, we should bear it the more
   patiently. So the people of God: 1 Tim. iv. 10 Therefore we both labour
   and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God.' It is no new
   thing for the adversaries of religion to scorn such as trust in God,
   and rely upon his promises; therefore bear it the, more patiently. (1.)
   Whether they be upbraidings of our trust: Mat. xxvii. 43, He trusted in
   God; let him deliver him now if he will have him, for he said, I am the
   Son of God;' Job iv. 6, Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope,
   and the uprightness of thy ways?' (2.) Or insultings over our low and
   comfortless condition. Men will tread down the hedge where they find it
   low. The Psalmist complaineth, Ps. lxix. 26, They speak to the grief of
   those whom thou hast wounded;' pour in vinegar and salt where they find
   a wound, and add affliction to the afflicted. You will hear bitter
   words. Christ himself was thus exercised: Mat. xxvii. 29, Hail, King of
   the Jews.' To be mocked and scorned we must expect, and that men will
   insult. (3.) Or whether they be perverse applications of providence.
   Thus Shimei insulted over David in his distress: 2 Sam. xvi. 7, 8, Come
   out, thou bloody man, thou man of Belial; the Lord hath returned upon
   thee all the blood of the house of Saul,' &c. So men will say, This is
   for your rebellion, &c.

   Use 2. Since there are two parties in the world, they that trust and
   they that reproach them for their trust, consider in what number you
   are. It is needful to be far from the disposition of the seed of the
   serpent, and not to have your tongues set on fire of hell, to be far
   from the disposition of those that are governed by sense and carnal
   interests. (1.) It is unmannerly to insult over any in distress, and to
   reproach them with their condition. Places blasted with lightning were
   accounted sacred amongst the heathens, because the hand of God had
   touched them; so you should not speak to the grief of those whom God
   hath wounded, but pity them, and pray for them, if they are fallen into
   God's hands. (2.) It is unchristian to reproach those that trust in
   God. It is easy to know them. Who are they that pray, that plead
   promises, that carry not on their hopes by present likelihoods? Though
   they have their faults, they are, for the main, strict, holy,
   charitable. (3.) It is dangerous to offend any of Christ's little ones,
   and to grieve their spirits.

   Doct. 3. That these reproaches are grievous to God's children, and go
   near their hearts; therefore David desires God to appear for him, that
   he may have somewhat to answer them that reproached him.

   1. Man's nature cannot endure reproach, especially a scornful reproach:
   every man thinketh himself worthy of some regard.

   2. Religion increaseth the sense of it, as the flood increased when the
   fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven
   were opened, Gen. vii. 11. When the deep below and the heaven above
   combined, the flood was greater; so when grace and nature join, it is
   very grievous. David said, Ps. xlii. 10, It was a sword in my bones
   when they said, Where is now thy God?' These were cutting words to
   David's heart.

   [1.] It is a dishonour to God, and they are sensible of that, as well
   as a misery to themselves.' It is a dishonour to his power, as if ha
   could not help; to his love, as if he would not; to his truth, as if he
   would fail in the needful time, or were fickle and inconstant, as if he
   would desert his friends in misery; to his holiness, as if he favoured
   wicked men in their evil courses, and formal dead-hearted services: Ps.
   1. 21, These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest
   that I was altogether such an one as thyself.' How can a soul that
   loveth God endure this, that the power of God should be lessened or his
   truth questioned? Rabshakeh said, What confidence is this wherein thou
   trustest?' Isa. xxxvi. 4, compared with xviii. 19, 20, Beware lest
   Hezekiah persuade you, saying, The Lord shall deliver us. Hath any of
   the gods of the heathens delivered his land out of the hand of the king
   of Assyria? Where are the gods of Hamath and Arphad? Where are the gods
   of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand? Who are
   they amongst all the gods that have delivered their land out of my
   hand, that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?' As if the
   living God had no more power than dumb idols. Therefore Hezekiah goeth
   and spreads the letter before the Lord. You touch a godly man to the
   quick when you strike at God's honour; they have a tender sense and
   feeling of this.

   [2.] It reflects upon the ways of God, to bring them out of request.
   You thought you were one of God's darlings, you thought nobody served
   God but you; this is your godly profession, your fasting and prayer;
   what need such niceness? Thus they count his way folly, his life
   madness.

   [3.] These reproaches strike at the life of faith, and therefore go
   very near the hearts of God's children. Trust and confidence in God is
   the life of their souls: Ps. iii. 2, There is no help for him in God'.
   Such temptations are very catching, when he seemeth opposite to. them.
   Now our unbelief puts in to make the temptation stronger. There is some
   visible pretence for what is said, Where are the promises thou talkest
   of? Where the promises and the deliverance? What have thy prayers
   brought from heaven? Thou hast called and none answered, cried and none
   hath pity on thee. What profit in serving the Lord? And then what
   followeth after this open objection? Unbelief cometh; and whispereth in
   our ears, Do you think those things true the word speaketh?

   Well, then, open your hearts to God, as Hezekiah did Rabshakeh's
   letter; tell him of these cruel mockings,' as they are called, Heb. xi.
   36. It is the manner of saints so to do: Ps. cxv. 2, Wherefore should
   the heathen say, Where is now their God?' and Joel ii. 17, on the
   fasting day let the priests, the ministers of the Lord, weep between
   the porch and the altar; and let them say, Spare thy people, O Lord,
   and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule
   over them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their
   God?'

   Doct. 4. God making good his promises, confuteth these reproaches and
   insultations. When deliverance cometh their mouths are stopped: Job v.
   16, The poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth;' Ps. cvii. 42,
   The righteous shall see it, and iniquity shall stop her mouth,' then
   when he sets the poor on high from affliction, and maketh them families
   like a flock.' In both these places it is not said, God stoppeth their
   mouths, or the saints stop their mouths, but they stop their own
   mouths; then we need not answer our adversaries, they answer
   themselves; they have not a word to say, and all their pride and
   insultation is defeated and silenced.

   Use 1. Prayer is necessary. Desire God to appear and right himself,
   that he may confute the perverse thoughts of men, and wrong
   applications of his providence, that carnal men may see your hope and
   confidence in God is not in vain. You may beg deliverance on this
   ground, that the mouth of iniquity may be stopped.

   Use 2. Wait. Carnal men reproach God's people with their trust, when in
   their distress he stays a little, when they have humbled themselves for
   their sins, and sought reconciliation with God as his word prescribeth,
   and are sufficiently weaned from carnal props, and have learned to
   depend on him; the wicked shall find himself mistaken about the godly,
   whose ways he counted folly.

SERMON XLIX.

   And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have
   hoped in thy judgments.--Ver. 43.

   IN the first verse of this portion David had begged for deliverance
   according to the word; this he backeth with several arguments. His
   first argument was from his enemies, who would else reproach him for
   his trust. He now enforceth that request from another argument, lest
   his case and condition should make him afraid, or his disappointments
   ashamed to own his faith in God's promises, and so his mouth be shut up
   from speaking of God and his word, for the edification of others and
   the confutation of the wicked. Here observe--

   1. His request, and take not the word of truth out of my mouth.

   2. The profession of his faith, repeated by way of argument and
   reasons, for I have hoped in thy judgments.

   1. For his request. You may wonder why he beggeth that the word of
   truth may not be taken out of his mouth. Rather you would think he
   should ask that it might be kept in his heart. But you must consider
   that confession of truth is very necessary, and in a time of dangers
   and distresses very difficult. The proper seat of the word of truth is
   the heart; it must abide there. But when the heart is full, the tongue
   will speak: I have believed, and therefore have I spoken,' Ps. cxvi.
   10. The word is first in the heart, and then in the mouth; therefore
   David saith, Take it not out of my mouth.' And pray, mark, he doth not
   only deprecate the evil itself, but the degree and extremity of it,
   Take it not utterly out of my mouth.' God's children may not have
   liberty to speak for him, or if liberty, not such a courage as is
   necessary. Therefore, though he should or had failed in being ashamed
   to profess his hope, yet he desireth he might not wholly want either an
   occasion or a heart so to do; that he might not wholly want an
   occasion, having no relief and comfort by the promises, nor an heart,
   as being altogether dismayed or disconsolate.

   2. The profession of his faith is renewed, For I have hoped in thy
   judgments.' The word msphtym, judgments, signifieth either the law, or
   the execution of the sentence thereof.

   [1.] The law, or whole word of God, so that I have hoped in thy
   judgments is no more but in thy word do I hope,' as it is Ps. cxxx. 5,
   I wait for the Lord, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.'

   [2.] Answerable execution, when the promise or threatening is
   fulfilled.

   (1.) When the promise is fulfilled, that is judgment in a sense; when
   God accomplisheth what he hath promised for our salvation and
   deliverance. Thus God is said to judge for his people when he righteth
   and saveth them according to his word: Lam. iii. 59, O Lord, thou hast
   seen my wrong; judge thou my cause.'

   (2.) But the more usual notion of judgment is the execution of the
   threatening on wicked men, which being a benefit to God's faithful
   servants, and done in their favour, David might well be said to hope
   for it. Their judgment is our obtaining the promise. Points:--

   Doct. 1. It is not enough to believe the word in our hearts, but we
   must confess it with our mouths.

   Doct. 2. Such trials may befall God's children that the word of truth
   may seem to be taken out of their mouths.

   Doct. 3. At such a time God must be dealt withal, as much concerned in
   it. David saith to the Lord, Take not the word of truth utterly out of
   my mouth.'

   Doct. 4. If it please God to desert us in some passage of our trial, we
   must not give him over, but deal with him not to forsake us utterly.

   Doct. 5. They will not utterly be overcome in their trials who hope in
   God's judgments.

   Doct. 1. It is not enough to believe the word in our hearts, but we
   must confess it with our mouths. So it is expressly said, Rom. x. 9.
   10, If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt
   believe in thy heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt
   be saved; for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with
   the mouth confession is made unto salvation.' There is the whole sum of
   Christianity, and it is reduced to these two points--believing with the
   heart, and confessing with the mouth; an entertaining of Christ in the
   heart with a true and lively faith, and a confessing of Christ with the
   mouth in spite of all persecution and danger. So in the first solemn
   proposal of the gospel: Mark xvi. 16, He that believeth and is baptized
   shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be damned;' where not
   only belief is required, but open profession; for that end serveth
   baptism, which is a badge and bond a badge to distinguish the
   worshippers of Christ from others, and a bond to bind us to open
   profession of the name of Christ, and practice of the duties included
   therein. So Heb. iii. 1, Jesus Christ is called the great high priest
   and apostle of our profession.' The Christian religion is a confession,
   not a thing to be smothered and kept in secret, or confined to the
   heart, but to be openly brought forth, and avowed in word and deed to
   the glory of Christ. If a man should content himself to own God in his
   heart, what would become of the Church of God, and all his ordinances,
   and the assemblies of his people, among whom we make this open
   confession?

   1. This confession is necessary as well as the inward belief, because
   God hath required it by an express law, which law is confirmed by a
   sanction of great weight and moment, the greatest promises on the one
   hand, and the greatest penalties and threatening^ on the other. That
   there is an express law for confession, besides what hath been said
   already, see 1 Peter iii. 15, Sanctify the Lord God of hosts in your
   hearts, and be ready always to give an answer to every one that asketh
   you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear;' where
   they are required not only to revere God in their hearts, but to be
   ready to own him with their mouths, and to give a testimony of him when
   it should be demanded; yea, that sanctifying God in their hearts is
   required in order to the testimony given with their. mouths, that
   having due and awful thoughts of God they may not be ashamed to own him
   before men. Now this is backed with the greatest promises, and on the
   other side with the severest threatenings. God hath promised no less
   than salvation to those that confess him: Mat. x. 32, Whosoever will
   confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which
   is in heaven.' Father, this is one of mine. He will do them more honour
   than possibly they can do him; and Rom. x. 10, With the mouth
   confession is made to salvation.' Salvi esse non possumus, saith
   Austin, nisi ad salutem proximorum etiam ore profiteamur fidem--we
   cannot be saved unless we profess the faith that we have. On the other
   side, the neglect of profession, either out of shame or fear, is
   threatened with the greatest penalties; Mark viii. 38, Whosoever shall
   be ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation,
   of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory
   of his Father with his glorious angels.' Then, when all shadows flee
   away, and we would crouch for a little favour, that Christ should be
   ashamed of us, These were Christians, but cowardly and dastardly ones:
   I cannot own them to be of my flock and kingdom,--oh, how will our
   faces gather blackness! The same is Luke ix. 26, Whosoever shall be
   ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed
   when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the
   holy angels.' So for fear: 2 Tim. ii. 11, If we suffer, we shall also
   reign with him; if we deny him, he will deny us.' So that you see it is
   not a matter of small moment whether we confess or no, but a thing
   expressly enjoined by God, and that upon terms of life and death.

   2. This confession is of great use, as conducing much to the glory of
   God and the good of others.

   [1.] The glory of God, which should be the great scope and end of our
   lives and actions, is much concerned in our confessing or not
   confessing what we believe. When we boldly avow the truth, it is a sign
   we are not ashamed of our master: Phil. i. 20, According to my earnest
   expectation and hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with
   all boldness, as always, so now also, Christ shall be magnified in my
   body, whether it be by life or by death.' Ministry or martyrdom, he
   calls this a magnifying of Christ; whereas flinching, concealing,
   halving the truth, denying confession, is called a being ashamed of
   Christ: Luke ix. 26, Whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words;'
   as if his name were a thing base, unworthy, not to be owned.

   [2.] The good of others and their edification is concerned in our
   confessing^or not confessing. No man is born for himself, and therefore
   is not only to work out his own salvation, but as much as in him lieth
   to procure the salvation of others, and to bring God and his truth into
   request with them; therefore not only to believe with the heart--that
   concerneth himself, but to confess with the mouth--that concerneth the
   good of others. When we own the truth, though it cost us dear, that
   tendeth to the furtherance of the gospel: Phil. i. 12, 13, For I would
   ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me
   have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel; so that my
   bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other
   places,' &c. But when we dissemble, that is a scandal and a
   stumbling-block to others, whom we justify and harden in a false way;
   as Peter, fearing them of the circumcision, dissembled, and the Jews
   dissembled with him, insomuch that Barnabas was carried away with their
   dissimulation,' Gal. ii. 12, 13, Men of public fame and-favour, when
   they are not men of courage and of self-denying spirits, their
   temporising may do a great deal of hurt, and, like a torrent, or
   stream, carry others with them. Oh, let us beware of this! Zuinglius
   saith, Ad aras Jovis et Veneris adorare, ei sub antichristo fidem
   occultare, idem est--as well worship before the altars of Jupiter and
   Venus, as hide our faith under antichrist. Fear and weakness excuseth
   not. The fearful and unbelieving are put with murderers and sorcerers
   and idolaters, and sent together to the lake that burneth with fire and
   brim stone, Rev. xxi. 8.

   Use 1. To reprove them that think it to be enough to own the truth in
   their hearts, without confessing it with their mouths. This libertinism
   prevailed at Corinth, where they thought they might be present at
   idols' feasts, as long as in their consciences they knew that an idol
   was nothing. The apostle argueth against them, 2 Cor. vi., and
   concludes his argument thus: 2 Cor. vii. 1, Having therefore these
   promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness
   of the flesh and spirit.' To pretend to serve God in my heart,
   whosoever thinks so mocketh God and deceiveth himself. He that warreth
   with the enemies of his prince, and is as forward in battle as any of
   the rest, can he say, I reserve the king my heart and affections? Or
   when a woman prostituteth her body to another, will the husband be
   content with such an excuse, that she reserveth her heart for him? God
   is not a God of half of a man: he made the whole body and soul r and
   will be served with both; he bought both: 1 Cor. vi. 20, Ye are bought
   with a price; therefore glorify God in your bodies and in your spirits,
   which are God's.' Therefore you should not only love him in your
   hearts, but openly plead for him and maintain his quarrel. The devil
   asketh but Christ's knee: Mark iv. 9, Fall down and worship me.' What I
   were all the martyrs of God rash, inconsiderate, that suffered so many
   things rather than lose their liberty in God's service? Would we be
   content God should deal with us as we deal by him, glorify their souls
   only, love their souls, but punish their bodies eternally?

   2. Them that, though not tainted with this libertine principle, yet are
   afraid or ashamed to own the truth.

   [1.] Some afraid because of troubles and persecution. Hath Christ
   endured so much for us, and shall we be afraid to own his truth? God
   forbid! If I would fear, whom should I be afraid of? Mat. x. 28, Fear
   not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but
   rather fear him who is able to destroy both body and soul in hell.'
   Whom should a child fear, his father or the servants of his house? So,
   whom should we fear, God or man, a prison or hell?

   2. Ashamed in peace and out of trouble, ashamed to own Christ in such
   company, or to speak of God and his word. O Christians! shall we be
   ashamed to speak for him that was not ashamed to die for us, or count
   religion a disgrace which is our glory? Would a father take it well
   that his son should be ashamed of him? Are we ashamed of the gospel,
   the great charter of our hopes, the seeds of the new life, the power of
   God to salvation?' Rom. i. 1 6, For I am not ashamed of the gospel of
   Christ, which is the power of God to salvation.' Oh, shake off this
   baseness! John v. 44, How can ye believe, which receive honour one of
   another, and seek not the honour that comes from God only?'

   Use 2. To exhort us to confess with the mouth, and to own the truths we
   are persuaded of. And here I shall handle the case of profession.

   1. How far it is necessary. It is a matter intricate and perplexed, and
   therefore I care not to comprise all cases, but to the most notable I
   shall speak.

   2. As to the manner how this profession is to be made.

   1. How far we are bound to profess.

   [1.] The affirmative.

   [2.] The negative.

   [1.1 The affirmative.

   (1.) It is certain that the great truths must be owned and publicly
   professed, or else Christ would not have a visible people in the world,
   distinct from pagans and heathens. Our baptism bindeth us to this
   profession, and to all practices consonant and agreeable with it: Rom.
   x. 10, With the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the
   mouth confession is made unto salvation.' To own Christ as the Saviour
   of the world, evidenced by his resurrection from the dead.

   (2.) It is certain we must do nothing to contradict the truth in the
   smallest matters: 2 Cor. xiii. 8, We can do nothing against the truth,
   but for the truth.' Nothing contrary to the glory of God, or the
   prejudice of the least truth, whatever it costs us.

   (3.) In lesser truths, when they are ventilated and brought forth upon
   the stage, and God crieth out, Who is on my side, who? we ought not to
   give up ourselves to an indifferency, to hide our profession for any
   danger: 2 Peter i. 12, Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you
   always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be
   established in the present truth.' The church of God is out of repair
   sometimes in one point, sometimes in another; the orthodoxy of the
   generality of men is usually an age too short in things now afoot; they
   go wrong, or forbear to give help to the church, be cause the god of
   this world hath blinded their eyes. Fight Christ, fight antichrist,
   they are resolved to be lookers-on.

   (4.) When our non-profession shall be interpreted to be a denial. Thus
   Daniel, chap. vi. 10, opened his casement, which looked towards
   Jerusalem, and prayed three times a day as he was wont. We must rather
   suffer than deny the truth by interpretation, when such practices are
   urged as cross a principle, and we comply.

   (5.) When others are scandalised by our non-profession, or not owning
   the truths of Christ; that is, not only with the scandal of offence or
   contestation, but with the scandal of seduction, in danger to sin; and
   to run into error by our not appearing for God, the interest of truth
   should prevail above our ease and private content.

   (6.) When an account of my faith is demanded, and I am called forth to
   give testimony for Christ, especially by magistrates: Mat. x. 18, Ye
   shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a
   testimony against them and the Gentiles: 1 Peter iii. 15, Be always
   ready to give an answer to every one that asketh a reason of the hope
   that is in you,' provided it be not in scorn: Prov. xxvi. 4, 5, Answer
   not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him.
   Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own
   conceit.' Answer and answer not; not out of curiosity, as Herod
   questioned Christ many things, but he answered him nothing, Luke xxiii.
   9; or to be a snare, Isa. xxxvi. 21, They held their peace, and
   answered him not a word, for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer
   him not,' nor parley with Rabshakeh. In such cases you must not cast
   pearls before swine, lest they turn again and rend you,' Mat. vii. 6.

   (7.) When impulsions are great, and fair opportunities are offered in
   God's providence: Acts xvii. 16, While Paul waited for them at Athens,
   his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to
   idolatry.' It is an intimation from God that then it is seasonable to
   interpose for his glory.

   [2.] Negatively, which is to be forborne.

   (1.) Till you be fully persuaded in your own mind of the truth which
   you would profess, for otherwise we shall appear with a various and
   doubtful face to the world, changing and wavering according to the
   uncertainty of our own thoughts, and so make the profession of religion
   ridiculous. We often see cause to suspect what before we were strongly
   conceited of. There is a certain credulity and lightness of believing
   which men are subject to. Now when this breaks out into sudden
   profession, men run through all sects and religions, and so blast and
   blemish their own service, therefore what is contrary to the received
   sense, especially of the godly, ought to be weighed and weighed again
   before we appear to the world to be otherwise minded.

   (2.) When the profession of a lesser truth proves an offence to the
   weak, and a disturbance to the church, and a hindrance of some greater
   benefit. All private opinions must give way to the great law of
   edification: Rom. xiv. 22, Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before
   God.' We must not perplex weak souls with doubtful disputations, till
   they be established in greater things; neither must the peace of the
   church be troubled with nice debates, but all things must give way to
   the profit and general edification.

   (3.) When the unseasonable venting of things will do more hurt than
   good, and the sway of the times and strong tide and current of
   prejudices running down against us hinder all probability of doing
   good, then our profession now may deprive us of a more useful
   profession another time: Prov. xxix. 11, A fool uttereth all his mind,
   but he that is wise keepeth it in till afterward.' Paul was at Ephesus
   two years before he spake against Diana, Acts xix. 10; only intimated
   in general terms that they were no gods that were made with hands. When
   we cannot effect the good things we desire, nor in that holy manner we
   would, we must not obstruct our future service, but commend the cause
   to God. and wait further opportunity to do good.

   2. The manner how to make profession.

   [1.] Knowledge must be at the bottom of profession. Some will run
   before they can go, leap into opinions and practices before they gee
   the reasons of them; and then no wonder they are as children, carried
   about with every wind of doctrine,' Eph. iv. 14. Wherefore, that which
   we profess we must do it knowingly, that we may be able to render a
   reason of all that we do profess.

   J2.] Gracious wisdom to espy the due occasion when God is glorified our
   neighbour edified. Bash, arrogant, and presumptuous spirits are heady,
   high-minded, disgrace religion more than honour it.

   [3.] With boldness to do it freely and without fear of men: Acts iv.
   13, When they saw the boldness of Peter and John.'.&c.; ver. 29, Grant
   to thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word;' and 1
   Tim. iii. 13, They that have used the office of a deacon well purchase
   to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is
   in Christ Jesus;' Acts ix. 27, Barnabas declared unto them how he had
   preached boldly to them at Damascus in the name of Jesus;' ver. 29, He
   spake boldly in the name of Jesus;' Acts xiv. 3, Long time therefore
   abode they speaking boldly in the Lord;' Acts xiii. 46, Then Paul and
   Barnabas waxed bold.' Fear and shame argueth diffidence of the truth
   which we profess, or else a distrust of the 3rod from whom it cometh,
   or at least the unsoundness of the professing party, that he hath a
   naughty conscience, or a great deal of fleshly fear unmodified. As he
   cannot walk stoutly that has a stone in his shoe, so he that hath sin
   in his conscience. Obmutescit facundia si aegra sit conscientia, saith
   Ambrose--a bad conscience stoppeth the mouth.

   [4.] With sincerity, without dissimulation and guile. Profession
   without answerable duty is like leaves without fruit. Words must come
   from the heart. To be talking of God when they lie under the guilt of
   known sins. James ii. 16, If one say unto the poor, Depart in peace, be
   ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things
   which are needful to the body, what doth it profit?' Ps. l. 16, 17,
   Unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes,
   or that thou shouldst take my covenant into thy mouth, seeing thou
   hatest instruction, and castest my word behind thee?'

   [5.] With meekness and reverence: Peter iii. 15, Be ready always to
   give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that
   is in you, with meekness and fear;' not in a passionate, froward,
   arrogant way, but with meekness of spirit, without all show of passion,
   and with sober and respectful language.

   [6.] The general end is the glory of God and the edification of our
   neighbour; and the means to this end is the fear of God, which keeps us
   out of all faulty extremes: Eccles. vii. 16, 17, Be not righteous
   over-much, neither make thyself over-wise: why shouldest thou destroy
   thyself? Be not over-much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why
   shouldest thou die before thy time?' Some drive all things to
   extremity, hot like gunpowder; others freeze into a compliance and time
   serving. When the heart is seasoned by the fear of God, and we are
   guided by reasons of conscience rather than interest, and we constantly
   wait upon God for direction, then will God guide us.

   Doct. 2. Such trials may befall God's children that the word of truth
   may seem to be taken out of their mouths.

   This may come to pass two ways:--

   1. They may not have liberty to own it; as Acts iv. 18, 19, They
   commanded them not to speak at all, nor to teach in the name of Jesus:
   and they said, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto
   you or unto God, judge ye.' The magistrate's command is a silencing of
   them, shutting of their mouths; only here cometh a question whether
   ministers forbidden by magistrates should desist from preaching? If we
   say they ought, it seems to be against the apostle's reply; if we say
   not, we shall seem to deny obedience to secular and politic powers, who
   ought to be satisfied in the persons that exercise a public ministry in
   their dominions, and so lay a foundation for public disturbance and
   disorder. For answer We must distinguish between persons employed to
   preach the gospel; some immediately called by Christ himself, others
   mediately called by men; some fallible and obnoxious to errors and many
   failings, which render them unworthy of such a calling; others
   infallibly guided and assisted. These latter, without flat disobedience
   and injury to Christ, could not own any command contrary to the
   precedent authority of Christ, being the only men of that order that
   could witness these things. It is true a necessity is laid upon us' of
   preaching the gospel, 1 Cor. ix. 16, so as not voluntarily to
   relinquish our station, but we may be forced to give way to the greater
   force. Some are silenced by authority and opposition of men, a
   dispensation God often permitteth for despising the truth and playing
   the wanton with an opportunity of open profession. When men dally with
   the light, God removeth their candlestick, and the door is shut upon
   them.

   2. They may not have courage to own the word of truth for fear of
   danger, because of many adversaries. There is a great deal of this
   unmortified fleshly fear in the best, and may be tongue-tied when God's
   glory is concerned, and awed by the menaces and insults of evil men, or
   discouraged, that they dare not trust God with events, and are out of
   all hope of success: Ezek. iii. 26, I will make thy tongue cleave to
   the roof of thy mouth, and thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them
   for a reprover, for they are a rebellious house.' By these and many
   other ways they may be discouraged from speaking of God and his truth.
   But now, when such a case falleth out, what shall we do? That in the
   third point.

   Doct. 3. At such a time God must be dealt withal about it upon two
   grounds:--

   1. Because God hath a great hand in the judgment. In the outward case,
   want of liberty, nothing falleth out without his providence; he seeth
   fit sometimes to exercise his people with unreasonable men, for all
   have not faith,' 2 Thes. iii. 2, that obstruct and hinder the course of
   the gospel; some that be like Elymas the sorcerer, enemies to all
   goodness,' Acts xiii. 10. And this in ecclesia constituta, in the bosom
   of the church, where orthodox faith is professed, where magistrates be
   Christians, and should be nursing fathers to the church. la Abraham's
   family, which Paul makes the pattern of our estate to the end of the
   world: Gal. iv. 29, But as then he that was born after the flesh
   persecuted him that was born after the spirit, even so it is now.'
   These may prevail many times to the great discouragement of the
   faithful. God may suffer it to be so for the punishing and trying of
   his people: Acts xix. 9, But when divers were hardened and believed
   not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from
   them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one
   Tyrannus.' Then, as to the inward case, he may justly desert us in the
   time of trial, when we should give a testimony for him, and take the
   word of truth out of our mouths. All these speeches: Hide not thy
   commandments from me,' ver. 19; Incline not mine heart to
   covetousness,' ver. 26; and here, Take not thy word out of my mouth,'
   and many such like, relate to God's judicial sentence, in what he doth
   as a judge. Upon our evil deserving he withdraweth his grace, and then
   we are delivered over to our own fears and baseness of spirit. Besides
   our own fault there is judicial tradition on God's part, which takes
   away the heart and courage of men: Job xii. 24, He taketh away the
   heart of the chief of the people, and causeth them to wander in a
   wilderness, where there is no way.' Now none can suspend God's sentence
   but God himself. If he shut who can open? therefore he is to dealt
   with.

   2. God only can give us a remedy by his grace and power; therefore our
   great business lieth with him, in regard of the power of his
   providence, by which he can remove rubs and oppositions: 2 Thes. iii.
   1, Pray for us, that the word of God may have a free course,' hina ho
   logos tou Theou treche--that it may run as chariot wheels on smooth
   ground, without rubs and oppositions. There are many times mountains'
   in the way, potent oppositions and strongly combined interests, that
   hinder the liberty of the word; but God can smoothe them into a plain:
   Zech. iv. 7, Who art thou, great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt
   become a plain.' Opposition seemeth insuperable. That great mountain
   that obstructed the work of God was the court of Persia, instigated and
   set on by the Samaritan faction--a great mountain indeed; but as great
   as it is, God can thresh it into dust, when it hindereth his interest.
   As to the inward case, it is God that giveth a spirit of courage and
   fortitude, and a mouth and wisdom which all the adversaries shall not
   be able to gainsay or resist,' Luke xxi. 15; he will give it us in that
   hour what we shall say. So God encourageth Moses when he pleadeth his
   slowness of speech: Who hath made man's mouth, or who maketh the dumb
   or deaf, or the seeing or the blind? Have not I the Lord?' Exod. iv.
   10, 11. Whatever inclination of heart there be in the creature, it is
   God must give a spirit and a presence, by the continual influence of
   his grace. He frees the heart from fears, and ordereth the tongue; for
   the power of the tongue is no more in our hands than the affections of
   the heart: Prov. xvi. 1, The preparations of the heart in man, and the
   answer of the tongue, is from the Lord,' parresi'a, is the gift of God,
   that we own him and his truth.

   Use. Let, then, every person be dealing with God about this case, every
   single private person for himself; and for public persons the prayers
   of others are necessary; it is a common case, wherein all are
   concerned: Col. iv. 3, Praying for us, that God would open to us a door
   of utterance to speak the mystery of Christ;' Eph. vi. 19, Pray for me
   that utterance may be given me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to
   make known the mystery of the gospel.' They that are sensible of the
   weight of the ministerial charge and their own many infirmities, and
   how much it concerns us to own all the truths of God in their season,
   let us beg of God this boldness, and set others a-begging for us.

   1. Humbly confessing our ill-deservings. It is a sign God is angry when
   he suffereth his gospel to be obstructed, much more when the mouths of
   his ministers are shut up that they shall not plead for his interest
   and truths. It is a notable sign of his departure that he is not much
   concerned in the progress of the gospel. God's raising spirits is a
   hopeful presage. Oh, therefore, let us humble ourselves before the
   Lord!

   2. Earnestly; for it is a case that concerneth us deeply, because upon
   our trial we should be strict and precise: Phil. i. 20, My hope and
   expectation is that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but with all
   boldness' own Christ. It would be sad if the gospel should suffer loss
   by us. Alas! what a torment to us will the thought of it be, that we
   have dishonoured God, and wronged souls, and strengthened the hands of
   the wicked! Origen, who had exhorted others to martyrdom, having
   himself bowed under the persecution, could never more open his mouth to
   preach the gospel, though often requested to it; only one day, having
   taken for his text Ps. 1. 16, Unto the wicked he saith, What hast thou
   to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant
   in thy mouth?' he wept very much, and could speak no more. Oh,
   therefore, it is no slight thing!

   3. Deal with God believingly; pray in faith. There are two
   considerations in the text which may fortify us:--

   [1.] Because it is a word of truth.

   [2.] There are judgments to be executed on the hinderers of the word of
   truth.

   [1.] It is a word of truth, and that will prevail at length, however it
   be obstructed for a time. In the first publishing of the gospel this
   was manifested, when the whole world was conspired to shut the door
   against it: 1 Cor. xvi. 9, A great door and effectual is opened to me,
   and there are many adversaries.' A few fishermen, who had not the power
   of the long sword, yet it is spread far and near. The fathers often
   urged this. Clemens Alexandrinus saith, Proposition Graeciae
   philosophiam si quivis magistratus prohibuerit, en statim perit;
   nostram autem doctrinam a prima usque ejus praedicatione prohibent
   reges, duces, magistratus cum universis satellitibus, illa tamen non
   flaccescit ut humana doctrina, sed magis floret. It spread far and
   near, the first reformation, what small beginnings it had.

   [2.] There are judgments, strange providences, by which God breaketh
   opposition, either changing the hearts of men, or else cutting them off
   in the mid-way, when his wrath his kindled but a little,' Ps. ii. 12.
   They dash against the corner-stone. God will show himself mighty and
   powerful in promoting the word of truth, and will carry on the kingdom
   of Christ over the backs of his enemies.

   Doct. 4. We should not give over dealing with God, though he is pleased
   to desert us in some passages of our trials, that he may not forsake us
   utterly.

   Many of God's choicest servants have been tripping: Ps. lxxiii. 21, As
   for me, my feet were almost gone, my steps had well-nigh slipped;' but
   they recover themselves again. Peter fell for a time, but after wards
   groweth bold. Once timorous Peter, but, Acts iv. 13, When they saw the
   boldness of Peter and John.' The martyrs that were permitted for a
   while to deny the truth, yet were not permitted to deny it utterly;
   they bewailed their faults, and suffered the more courageously. (1.) It
   is fit the creatures should know themselves; therefore God will humble
   us, and in part leave us to our own fears, but not wholly leave us
   destitute of grace; as the nurse seemeth to let the child fall, that he
   may clasp the more strongly about her. (2.) It is fit the world should
   know that a zealous defence of the truth comes not from natural
   stubbornness and pertinacity, but from divine assistance; therefore God
   showeth what the flesh would do, how it would shrink in the confession
   of the truth, if it were permitted to prevail. (3.) It is fit we should
   see the necessity of continual dependence. After grace received we have
   not always the same presence of mind so as to plead for God, but only
   as he is pleased to influence us: our case doth change and alter, ebb
   and flow, as it pleaseth God.

   Use. Not to be severe against those that fail out of infirmity, nor to
   cast them off, for God doth not pity them; rather than censure them,
   let us help them out of the mire. Unhumbled hearts, that are puffed up
   with pride and confidence in their own strength, when out of the
   temptation may judge it a task of no great difficulty to carry it with
   courage, and will readily condemn others of cowardice and backsliding
   who ride not out the storm with as much courage and cheerfulness and
   resolution as they conceive themselves would do: Job iv. 5-7, Now it is
   come upon thee and thou faintest, it toucheth thee and thou art
   troubled. Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, and the uprightness of
   thy ways thy hope?' But a humble heart, acquainted with sufferings,
   will not judge so: he is sensible of weakness, and how hard it is for
   flesh and blood to deny itself, and to prefer a good conscience before
   safety and worldly increase: how ready it is to faint under a continued
   cross, how crafty to find out evasions to beguile itself into a way of
   sin, that they pity the poor tempted man. In the primitive times,
   Novatus and his followers denied those that had fallen to be received
   into the communion of the church, though upon repentance.

   Doct. 5. They will not be utterly overcome in their trials that hope in
   God's judgments. Why?

   1. Because this hope will teach us to wait upon the Lord until he show
   us better things: Ps. lxii. 5, My soul, wait thou upon the Lord, for my
   expectation is from him.' They can tarry a little while, and so are not
   carried away with the violence of the present temptation. It is an
   inclination to present things that undoeth us. Demas hath forsaken us
   and loved this present world.' Now, when we can wait for future things,
   the soul is stayed and kept from apostasy. We read of the patience of
   hope,' 1 Thes. i. 3. And the apostle saith, Rom. viii. 25, If we do
   hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.' He
   that believeth a better condition is not dejected with present evils.

   2. It fortifieth the soul against present difficulties, so as they do
   not unsettle, but quicken us. It hath an apprehension that the good is
   hard to be obtained, therefore it gathereth all the force and strength
   of the soul to resist it.

   For the nature of hope, see the Sermon on the 114th verse.

   Well, then, hope in God's judgments. Consider who hath made the
   promises. Is it not God, whose word cannot fail of its effect? Rom. iv.
   20, 21, He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, but
   was strong in faith, giving glory to God, and being fully persuaded
   that what he had promised he was able also to perform.' And then
   consider how he standeth affected to us. Doth not he love us? And also
   in what relation he is obliged to us as a Father. And then consider
   what doth the promise say, and how it maketh for his glory to
   accomplish it; what plentiful means he hath in store to bring to pass
   what he hath spoken, and what a potent and wise intercessor we have to
   plead our cause at the right hand of the Father, and to mind him still
   of whatever concerns our comfort!
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON L.

   So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.--Ver. 44.

   FIRST, David prays for deliverance, ver. 41, Let thy salvation come,'
   &c. Next he prays, if he might not have deliverance, yet a little
   liberty to own God in the time of his trouble, Take not the word of
   truth utterly out of my mouth;' and with what argument doth he enforce
   it? In the close of the former verse he had pleaded, I have hoped in
   thy judgments.' Now he pleads his steadfast purpose to serve God,
   conceived in the form of a vow, So shall I keep thy law,' &c. They that
   hope in God's promises must have a tender regard to his precepts. First
   he saith, I hope in thy judgments,' then, I shall keep thy law.' The
   tender regard of God's precepts. How? What! to talk of them only? No.
   As in the former verse he speaks of the word of truth in his mouth, so
   here he speaks of keeping and observing the law in his practice, to
   show we should not own God in word only, but in deed also. He spoke of
   profession there, and now we are to fill up our profession with
   answerable practice: So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and
   ever.'

   The text contains a promise of obedience.

   1. The matter promised, I shall keep thy law.

   2. The manner and constancy of that obedience, continually for ever and
   ever.

   Mark, the promise of obedience is brought in by way of argument, So
   shall I keep;' so, that is, this will encourage me, this will enable
   me.

   1. The granting of his requests would give him encouragement. When God
   answers our hope and expectation, gratitude should excite and quicken
   us to give him all manner of obedience. If he will give us a heart, and
   a little liberty to confess his name and serve him, we should not be
   backward or uncertain, but walk closely with him.

   2. This would give him assistance and strength. If God do daily give
   assistance, we shall stand; if not, we fall and falter. This will be a
   means of his perseverance; not only engage and oblige him, but help him
   to hold out to the end.

   Then mark the constancy of this obedience, Continually, and for ever
   and ever.' David would not keep it for a fit, or for a few days, or a
   year; but always, even to the end of his life.

   Here are three words to the same sense, Continually, for ever, and
   ever.' And the Septuagint expresseth it thus: I shall keep thy law
   always, and for ever, and for ever and ever; four words there. This
   heaping of words is not in vain.

   1. It shows the difficulty of perseverance. Unless believers do
   strongly persist in the resistance to temptation, they will soon be
   turned out of the way; therefore David binds his heart firmly. We must
   do it now, yea, always, unto the end.

   2. He expresseth his vehemency of affection. Those that are deeply
   affected with anything are wont to express themselves as largely as
   they can. As Paul, that had a deep sense of God's power: Eph. i. 19,
   Exceeding greatness of his power,' according to the working of his
   mighty power.' He heaps up several words, because his sense of them was
   so great. So David here doth heap up words, continually, and for ever,
   and for ever and ever.

   3. Some think the words are so many, that they may express not only
   this life but that which is to come. I will keep them continually, and
   for ever and ever;' that is, all the days of my life, and in the other
   world. So Chrysostom, I will keep them continually,' &c., points out
   the other life, where there will be pure and exact keeping of the law
   of God. Here we are every hour in danger, but then we shall be put out
   of all danger; and without fear of sinning, we shall remain in a full
   and perfect righteousness. We hope for that which we have not attained
   unto, and this doth encourage us for the present; so would he make
   David express himself.

   4. If we must distinguish these words, I suppose they imply the
   continuity and perpetuity of obedience: the continuity of obedience,
   that he would serve God continually without intermission; and the
   perpetuity of obedience, that he would serve God for ever and ever,
   without defection and revolt, at all times, and to the end.

   Doct. Constancy and perseverance in obedience is the commendation of
   it.

   When David promiseth to obey, he saith he would do it continually for
   ever and ever.' This is the obedience God longs for: Deut. v. 29, Oh,
   that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and
   keep all my commandments always!' Here we find all things which are
   requisite to God's service: the sincerity of it, that they had a heart;
   the gracious principle which works in obedience, a heart to fear me;
   the universality of it, to keep all my commands; and the perpetuity of
   it, to keep them always. They are in a good mood now. As if God had
   said, Oh, that they bad a heart to do it always! Christ redeemed us to
   this end: Luke i. 74, 75, Delivered us out of the hands of our enemies,
   that we might serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness
   before him;' not for a while only, but all the days of our life.'

   I shall distinguish of a double constancy and perseverance, and under
   ach branch give some reasons, with their applications.

   1. A perseverance without intermission.

   2. Without defection. Both are necessary.

   First, A perseverance without intermission. We should at all times and
   in all places serve God, and not by fits and starts; as it is said of
   the twelve tribes, Acts xxvi. 12, they served God instantly clay and
   night;' alone and in company, in all conditions, adverse and
   prosperous. In all actions, common and sacred, God must be served and
   obeyed.

   Let me give some considerations to enforce it, to serve God
   continually.

   1. The law of God doth universally bind, and the obligation thereof
   never ceaseth, so as there can be no truce with sin for a while, nor
   any intermission of grace for a moment: Prov. vi. 21, 22, O my son,
   keep thy father's commandments, and forsake not the law of thy mother;
   bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck.'
   The commandments of God, he calls them the law of the father and
   mother; for Solomon speaks as to young ones and children, as those that
   had been trained up by their parents. Now these must be looked upon as
   having a perpetual obligation to direct us and keep us: sleeping and
   waking we must have them always in our sight. Every motion and every
   operation of ours is under a law; our thoughts and words are under a
   law, and our actions are under a law; all that we speak and all that we
   do, it is still under a rule. The law of God is of perpetual use to
   show us what we must do and what we must leave undone. Oh, how exact
   should we be if we did regard this, and were mindful of the perpetual
   obligation of the law!

   2. Grace planted in the heart should be always working. The fire on the
   altar was never to go out; and so grace should be always working, and
   influence all our actions, civil and sacred: 1 Peter i. 15, Be ye holy,
   as he that hath called you is holy, in all manner of conversation.'
   There is no part of a Christian's conversation which should not savour
   of holiness; not only his religious, but his common and civil actions.
   The pots in Jerusalem and the horses' bells were to bear God's impress,
   as well as the vessels and utensils of the temple, Zech. xiv. As the
   sun is placed in the middle of the heavens to diffuse his influence and
   scatter his beams up and down the world, and nothing is hid from his
   light, so is grace planted in the heart to diffuse its influence into
   every part of his conversation; and therefore grace, where it is true,
   it is always at work. There are some parts of the body that are never
   out of action, as the heart and lungs; wherever a man goes, and
   whatever he goes about, yet they always do their office. So some graces
   are of continual exercise; as the fear of God: Prov. xxiii. 17, Be thou
   in the fear of God all the day long.' A Christian doth not only pray in
   the fear of God, but eat, drink, and trade in the fear of God. So the
   love of God, in referring all things to his glory, whether they be acts
   of worship, or acts of charity, or of our callings, or recreations:
   grace hath an influence upon these, and is still to be at work upon
   these, 1 Cor. x. 31. And so faith is always at work in depending upon
   God and looking up to him; it is our life, That which I live in the
   flesh:' Gal. ii. 20, All that I live in the flesh I live by the faith
   of the Son of God.' Well, then, the law of God is always binding, and
   every operation of ours is under a law, and grace should always be
   working.

   3. God's eye is always upon us; he is alike everywhere; therefore a
   Christian should be alike everywhere, always like himself, at home and
   abroad, alone and in company: Phil. ii. 12, As ye have always obeyed,
   not as in my presence only, but much more in my absence.' Many are
   devout abroad, but carnal, careless, profane, if you follow them home
   to their families. When you are alone you are not alone, God is there;
   we have a heavenly Father that seeth in secret, Mat. vi. 4; what you do
   in your closets, the doors made fast, and all company shut out. A man
   might allow himself in carnal liberty if he could go anywhere where God
   doth not see him; but his eye is still upon us; and therefore we should
   say with David, I will keep thy law continually.' Will he force the
   queen before my face?' saith Ahasuerus. We break God's laws before his
   face; his eye is always upon us, and all our ways are before him.

   4. God is always at work for us: John v. 17, My Father worketh
   hitherto, and I work.' He sustains us every day, hour, moment, and
   waketh ^for us, watcheth over us by night and by day. When we sleep,
   the devil is awake to do us mischief. Ay! but the God of Israel, he
   that keepeth Israel neither slumbereth nor sleepeth,' but watcheth for
   our good. As soon as we arise, his compassions are new every morning,'
   Lam. iii. 22, 23. Now, can we offend him from whom we receive life and
   breath every moment? If God should intermit his care but for one day,
   nay, but suspend it for one hour, what would become of thee?

   5. All our actions concern eternity. This life is compared to a walk,
   Eph. ii. 10. Everything we do or speak is a step either to heaven or
   hell, therefore to have an influence or tendency on that action. The
   more good we do, the more we are acted with a fear of God, and love of
   God, to do all things to his glory, the nearer heaven; and the more
   evil, the nearer hell. We should not stand still or go back, but always
   be getting ground in our journey.

   6. To be off and on with God will cost us much sorrow; it will be
   bitterness in the end. Either it will cost us the bitterness of
   repentance here, or of weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth for
   ever; either holy compunction or everlasting horror. When you straggle
   from God, there is no returning to your former husband but by
   Weeping-cross, Hosea ii. 14. And who would provide matter of sorrow for
   himself? I say, when you thrust your hand into Satan's dish, there is
   some sauce mingled with his meat, and then everlasting horror if not
   compunction, for that will be the end of them that are always un stable
   in all their ways, James i. 8. God will not always bear with them; he
   may at first, while they are children, poor weak novices, but will not
   always, Eph. iv. 14. God expects that at length we should grow more
   constant, and grow up to a radicated state of grace; therefore, if we
   are always children, off and on with God, then he will cast us off.

   7. By every intermission we may lose ground, and possibly may never
   wholly, if we recover it in part again. We may lose ground, for the way
   of the Lord is strength to the upright,' Prov. x. 29. The more we
   continue in it the fitter we are to walk in it. A bell, when once up,
   is kept up with greater ease than if we were to raise it anew. A horse
   warm in his gears is more fit for his journey than at first setting
   forth; and therefore keep up while you are in the way of God. If it be
   hard to keep in with God, it will be harder to recover when you are out
   of the way. The only way to make religion easy is to be still in it,
   and to have our hearts still upon it; and therefore you lose by your
   intermission. And if you recover yourselves after intermission, it is
   not always to that degree of largeness of heart and fulness of
   spiritual comfort. A prodigal that hath rioted away his estate, if set
   up again, is not trusted with the like stock; and after a great
   disease, though a man recovers, yet it is not to the degree of his
   former health many times. Therefore we should without intermission
   persevere in our duty to God.

   To apply this part.

   Use 1. It should humble us all that we are so fickle and inconstant in
   that which is good. Our hearts are unstable as water. In the space of
   an hour, how are our thoughts changed from good to evil, and from evil
   to good in a moment! What a monster would man seem, if his heart were
   visible, in the best duty that ever he performed! Our devotion and
   goodness comes by pangs and fits; now humble, anon proud; now meek,
   anon passionate; now confident, then full of fear and anguish. Like men
   sick of an ague, sometimes well, some times ill, we do not seem to be
   the same men in a duty and out of a duty; nay, sometimes in the same
   duty we do not seem to be the same men, are not carried on with the
   same largeness of heart, and confidence in God, and savouriness and
   spirituality. Oh, how changeable and fickle are our hearts! This should
   humble us.

   2. It reproveth them that would have a dispensation at times, and take
   liberty to cast off all Christian modesty and gravity; that think if
   they be serious sometimes, they may be light and vain at others; and
   therefore sometimes like angels of light, at other times like fiends of
   darkness. Sometimes we would take them for grave, serious Christians,
   at other times for loose libertines; and they cast the fear of God
   behind their backs: Ezek. xxxiii. 13, If he trust to his own
   righteousness, and commit iniquity,' &c.; that is, if upon presumption
   that he hath been righteous, he dispenseth with himself, and takes an
   indulgence from his former duty to be light, vain, careless, all his
   righteousness shall be forgotten. Such a dissimilitude is there between
   men; now they seem to be grave and serious, anon vain, light, and
   wanton; so very uncertain and uneven are we in our temper and practice.

   3. It shows what need there is of a constant watchfulness, that in all
   things we may behave ourselves as God's children. Sin is always at
   work: Gen. vi. 5, The imaginations and thoughts of our heart are only
   evil, and that continually:' and Satan is always at work, espying
   advantages against us, 1 Peter v. 8, to draw us off from God. Oh, then,
   let grace be in its continual exercise! Live as knowing all the motions
   and operations of the soul are under a rule; live as being always under
   the eye of God; live as being sensible God takes care of us himself,
   remembereth us every moment, therefore it is but reason we should take
   him.

   Secondly, A perseverance without defection and apostasy, that we may
   not fall off from God when we have taken a profession of his name upon
   us. Now, the considerations to quicken you to that will be these:--

   1. Consider how equal it is that our duty should last so long as we
   would have God's blessings last, that one part should answer another.
   We would have God bless us to the end, therefore we must serve and obey
   him to the end: Ps. xlviii. 14, For this God is our God for ever and
   ever; he will be our guide even unto death.' He doth not lay down the
   conduct of his providence until we come to heaven, and therefore we
   should keep his law for ever and ever. How can we desire God to be ours
   to the end, if we are not his to the end? The stipulation of our part
   of the covenant must answer that of God's.

   2. We have the same reasons to continue that we had to begin at first;
   there is the same loveliness in God's ways; Christ is as sweet as ever,
   and heaven as worthy and as great as ever. If there be any difference,
   there is more reason to continue than there was to begin. Why? Because
   we have more experience of the sweetness of Christ; you knew him before
   only by report and hearsay, but now you have tasted he is gracious, you
   know him by experience, 1 Peter ii. 3. Surely when we have made trial,
   Christ should be sweeter and heaven nearer: Rom. xiii. 11, Our
   salvation is nearer.' The nearer to the enjoyment of any good, the more
   impatient in the want of it. A Christian, as he is nearer to his hopes
   and happiness, and the more experience of God and Christ, the more
   stable should his heart be in the ways of God. I speak of this, because
   at first men are carried out with great affection and zeal, and are of
   very promising beginnings. There is no reason of altering our course,
   or why we should grow remiss, lazy, and changeable in God's service.
   What is more usual with men than to cast off their first faith, 1 Tim.
   v. 12, and their first love, Rev. ii. 4, and their first diligence and
   obedience, 2 Chron. xvii. 3. We read of the first ways of David.' Many
   that seem to have set forth with a great deal of forwardness and zeal
   tire afterward. In the marriage relation true affection increaseth, but
   adulterous love is hot only while it is new.

   3. Consider the danger and mischievous effects of apostasy and
   declining from God.

   [1.] This is somewhat, that you lose your crown: Rev. iii. 11, 4 Hold
   that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.' The honour and
   comfort of all we have hitherto done and suffered will be lost and
   gone, Therefore take heed to yourselves, that ye lose not the things
   which ye have wrought.' All your watchings, strivings, prayings,
   fastings, professing the name of God, all is come to nothing. The
   Nazarite under the law was to begin again if the days of his separation
   were defiled, Num. vi. 12. If he had separated himself for such a
   while, though he kept almost all his time, yet if he defiled himself
   before the time was out, he was to begin all again: Ezek. xviii. 24,
   When the righteous turneth away from his righteousness and committeth
   iniquity, all his righteousness that he hath done shall not be
   mentioned.' When you turn head against your former profession, all
   comes to nothing.

   [2.] Consider, falling off is more dishonourable to God than a simple
   refusal. Why? You bring an ill report upon him, as if he were not a
   good master. A wicked man that refuseth grace, he does not so much
   dishonour God, because his refusal is supposed to be the fruit of his
   prejudice. But now you cast him off after trial, and so your refusal is
   supposed to be the fruit of your experience, as if the devil were a
   better master. When you have tried both, you do as it were deliberately
   judge that Satan's service is best, or that you do not find in God that
   which he promised, and you expected from him. And that is the reason
   why God stands upon his credit, and pleads with apostates, Jer. ii. 5,
   What iniquity have your fathers found in me that they are gone far from
   me?' and Micah vi. 3, my people, what have I done unto thee, and
   wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.' Is he hard to please,
   or backward to reward? What cause of distaste have you found in him?
   for you do implicitly accuse him.

   [3.] When you fall off after a taste of the sweetness and comfort of
   the practice of godliness, your condition is worse than if you had
   never begun, and you will be more unable than you were at first A man
   that is climbing up a tree or ascending a ladder, if after he hath
   gotten up many steps he let go his hold and falls down, he doth not
   only lose the benefit of his former pains, but gets a bruised body and
   broken bones, and is less able to climb up than he was before.

   [4.] All the promises are made to perseverance, Heb. iii. 6; Col. i.
   23; Rev. ii. 10; Rom. ii. 7. Oh! there be many that leave their first
   love, and so they forfeit all the comfort of the promises.

   [5.] The more you persevere, the more assurance you have of the
   goodness of your condition: Heb. vi. 11, We desire that every one of
   you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the
   end.' When a man keeps up his warmth, his hope increaseth, and he grows
   to more assurance and more establishment, and keeps up his diligence in
   God's service.

   Use 1. For reproof.

   1. Those that take up religion only by way of essay and trial, that do
   not resolve upon all hazards, but take it only as a walk, and not a
   journey, like men that go to sea for pleasure, not to make a voyage.
   But whenever we begin with God, we should say, I will keep thy law
   continually for ever and ever. We should sit down and count the
   charges, make God a good allowance, resolve that nothing shall with
   draw us from him, Rom. viii. 35, 36.

   2. It reproveth aguish Christians, whose piety and devotion takes them
   by fits. Their righteousness is like the morning dew,' Hosea vi. 4,
   that cannot endure the rising sun, and so they are off and on with God.

   3. Those that are of the Samaritan temper, swayed altogether by
   temporal advantages. The Samaritans, sometimes they would be of the
   Jews' religion, when favoured by Alexander; when the Jews were pursued
   by other princes, then they would be against the Jews, and deny the
   temple of God: sometimes their temple was dedicated to the God of
   Israel, sometimes to the God of the heathens, as their interests did
   fall or rise. So there are many that do intend or remit the conscience
   of their duty according to their interests; and therefore, when trouble
   ariseth, they are offended, Mark iv. 17.

   Use 2. For exhortation, to press you thus to keep God's law for ever
   and ever. To this end--

   Direct. 1. Be fortified within. After you have gotten grace--I suppose
   men that they are in a good way--oh, be fortified from that which may
   shake you from without. Three things are wont to hurry men from one
   extreme to another--errors, persecutions, and scandals.

   1. Errors. Be not troubled when differences fall out about the truths
   of God, nor shaken in mind: 1 Cor. xi. 19, For there must be also
   heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest
   among you.' Many question the ways of God and all religion; because
   there are so many differences about them, therefore they think nothing
   certain. These winds God lets loose upon the church to distinguish the
   chaff and the solid grain. God saw this discipline necessary, that we
   might not take up religion upon trust, without the pains of study and
   prayer.

   2. Persecutions are an offence: Mat. xi. 6, Blessed is he whosoever
   shall not be offended in me;' that is, offended because of troubles
   that accompany the profession of the truth. The whole drift of the
   Christian religion is to draw us off from the interests and
   concernments of the present world, to look after another.

   3. Scandals of professors. All that profess the name of God are his
   witnesses; their lives should be a confirmation of the gospel, but
   indeed they often prove a confutation of it we should confirm the weak,
   and we offend the strong. Many have been gained by persecution, when
   they have seen the courage of God's servants; but the scandals of those
   that profess the name of God have proved a stumbling-block. Those that
   are offended by crosses, yet they have a secret liking of the truth;
   but those that are offended by scandals, they loathe the truth itself,
   and so are hurried away against the profession of God. Therefore be
   fortified against all these.

   Direct. 2. Be fortified within by taking heed to the causes of apostasy
   and falling off from the truth, either in judgment or practice. What
   are those things?

   1. Ungrounded assent. A choice lightly made is lightly altered, when
   men do not resolve upon evidence. We are to try all things,' 1 Thes. v.
   21. When we take up a profession without evidence, we soon quit it: men
   waver hither and thither for want of solid rooting in the truth.

   2. Ungrounded profession, want of solid rooting in grace, when not
   rooted either in faith, Col. ii. 7, or grounded in love, Eph. iii. 17,
   or established by grace, Heb. xiii. 9. There must be a foundation
   before a building, a thorough sense of the love of God, and a being
   rooted, when our hearts are sound in God's statutes.

   3. Unmodified lusts. That which is lame is soon turned out of the way.
   While men keep up their respects to the pleasures, profits, and honours
   of the world unbroken, they are sure to miscarry; though they should
   stand for a while, yet temptation will come that will take them away.
   Lusts put us upon great uncertainty, as fear, or the favour of men, or
   as carnal hopes sway: 2 Tim. iv. 10, Demas hath forsaken us, having
   loved this present world.'

   4. A fond easiness. Men change their religion with their company, out
   of a desire to please all, as the cameleon changeth colours according
   as it touches. True religion is indeed easy to be entreated,' James
   iii. 17. But now, to make bold with God and conscience, to please men,
   is a sad adventure; it is not a good disposition, but pusillanimity.

   5. Self-confidence, when we think to bear it out with natural courage
   and resolution, and will be playing about the cockatrice's hole, and
   dallying with temptation; as Peter's confidence; you know how dear it
   cost him, John xviii. 16, 17. It is God which keepeth the feet of his
   saints,' and he will be known to be their guardian, 1 Sam. ii. 9;
   therefore he will be depended on.

   Direct. 3. Take heed of the first decays, and look often on the state
   of your hearts. A man that never casts up his estate is undone
   insensibly. It is the devil's policy, when once we are a-declining, to
   carry us further and further. A gap once made in the conscience, grows
   wider and wider every day. The first declinings are the cause of all
   the rest. Evil is best stopped in the beginning. When first you begin
   to be careless, mindless of God, and neglectful of communion with him,
   oh! then take heed. It is easier to crush the egg than kill the
   serpent. He that keeps the house in constant repair prevents the ruin
   and fall of it; so do you keep your soul in constant repair, take
   notice of the first swerving, lest it carry you further and further.
   Men fall off by degrees, and grow worse and worse, neglect this duty
   and that, till they cast off all. Like Nebuchadnezzar's image, which
   was of gold, silver, iron, clay, from worse to worse, they presently
   run from one extremity to another. There are degrees of hardness: Heb.
   iii. 14, Let us hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the
   end.' The first sense, taste, and liveliness of it: learn from whence
   you are fallen. And then a steadfast expectation of the reward, 1 Cor.
   xv. 58. You have but a few years' service more, a little while to be
   put upon labour and striving, then you shall be as happy as heart can
   wish. Then a religious use of the Lord's Supper, for here you renew
   again the oath of allegiance to God. The great purport of this duty is
   to bind yourselves to this firm and close walking. The Lord's Supper is
   a renewing of covenant, to fix our hearts by new promises of obedience.
   When we begin to waver and faint, and stand, we receive new strength;
   as they, when they had a little refreshing, then they went on from
   strength to strength, Ps. lxxxiv. 7, 8. The Lord's Supper is our
   viaticum, our well and refreshing by the way, that we may hold out to
   our journey's end.

SERMON LI.

   And I will walk at liberty; for I seek thy precepts.--Ver. 45.

   THE copulative in front of the text showeth some dependence which the
   words have upon the former. His last request was, ver. 43, for an
   opportunity and heart to own the ways of God. His arguments are--

   1. His present hope, in the end of that verse.

   2. His perseverance in obedience, ver. 44. Now--

   3. The freedom of his heart in that continued course of obedience. A
   free and open confession of the truth may seem to cast us into bonds
   and straits, but yet it giveth us liberty: the truth sets us free, John
   viii. 32. If it bring the body under fetters, yet it enlargeth the
   heart, We never have greater freedom than when we are pleasing God,
   though at our bitter cost: I will walk at liberty,' non in angustiis
   timoris, sed in latitudine dilectionis--not straitened by fear, but set
   at large by love: I will walk at liberty; for I seek thy precepts.' In
   the words observe--

   1. David's privilege, and I will walk at liberty.

   2. The ground of it, for I seek thy precepts.

   The points are two:--

   Doct. 1. To walk in the way of God's precepts is to walk at liberty.

   Doct. 2. The more we take care to do so, the more we find this liberty.
   I seek, that noteth an earnest diligence. Both these points will be
   made good by these three considerations:--

   1. The way of God's precepts is in itself liberty.

   2. There is a liberty given to walk in that way.

   3. Upon walking in that way we find it liberty.

   First, The way of God's precepts is liberty. Therefore his law is
   called a law of liberty,' James i. 25. No such freedom as in God's
   service; and, on the contrary, no such bondage as to be held with the
   cords of our own sin: 2 Peter ii. 19, While they promise them liberty,
   they themselves are the servants of corruption.' A liberty to do all we
   please is the greatest bondage. There are three pairs of notions in
   which men are extremely mistaken--in misery and happiness, wisdom and
   folly, liberty and bondage. Men think none miserable but the afflicted,
   and none happy but the prosperous, because they judge by the present
   ease and commodity of the flesh; therefore Christ in his Sermon on the
   Mount maketh it his drift to undeceive the world, to show that the
   mourners and the persecuted, the pure and the meek, they are the happy
   men, Mat. v. So in the notions of wisdom and folly the world are
   mistaken. Man, that is an intelligent creature, affects the reputation
   of wisdom, and would rather be accounted wicked than weak. But how do
   they mistake? He is the wise man in their account that can carry on his
   worldly business with success. They judge of wisdom and folly, not by
   the concernments of the other world, but by present interests.
   Therefore the whole drift of the scripture is to make us wise to
   salvation,' 2 Tim. iii. 15, to call us off from secular wisdom, and to
   teach us to become fools that we may be wise. So they are put in the
   notions of liberty and bondage. All men desire liberty, especially from
   tyranny and base servitude; and so far they do well in the general: but
   then they think that is only liberty to do what they please; and so the
   more they think to be, and labour to be, free in a carnal way, the more
   slaves they are. The service of God, and strict walking with him, they
   count a very prison and thraldom; and therefore cry out of bonds and
   yokes and cords: Ps. ii. 3, Let us break their bonds asunder, and cast
   away their cords from us;' and are impatient of any restraint. Whereas,
   on the other side, to do what we list without check or control, and to
   speak what we list, and think what we list, this they think the only
   freedom: Our tongues are our own: who is Lord over us?' Whereas,
   indeed, he liveth the freest life that lieth under the bonds of duty,
   that maketh conscience of praying and praising God, and conversing and
   walking with him in a course of holiness; and the true liberty is in
   walking in God's statutes. So that true bondage and liberty is little
   or nothing at all known and discerned in the world. To make this
   evident unto you, I shall prove--

   1. That carnal liberty is but thraldom.

   2. That the true liberty is in the ways of God.

   1. That carnal liberty is but thraldom. To understand this, I^must lay
   down one proposition that conduceth to cure the great mistake about
   liberty and bondage: That liberty is not potestas vivendi ut velis a
   power to live as we list; no, it is to live as we ought--potestas
   volendi quod lex divina jubet. The life and spirit of liberty lieth in
   that, a power to do what we ought, not a power to do what we will. Ever
   since we drank in that poison, Ye shall be as gods,' Gen. iii. 5, man
   affecteth a dominion over himself, and would be lord of his own
   actions, sui juris, at his own dispose, do what he pleaseth. Indeed, if
   we had a perfectly holy understanding to guide us, the danger would not
   be so great; but now it is the greatest misery that can befall a man to
   be at his own dispose, to do lawlessly what he will: and therefore
   God's fearful and dreadful judgment, after all other courses tried, is
   to give up men to the sway of their own hearts, to do what they please:
   Ps. lxxxi. 12, So I gave them up to their own hearts' lust, and they
   walked in their own counsels;' to be left to our brutish affections.
   But to prove it.

   [1.] That infringeth a man's liberty that hindereth and disableth him
   from prosecuting his great end, which is to be truly happy. Now thus
   doth the carnal life, and therefore this is true and perfect bondage.
   Though men live in their bonds with as much delight as fishes in their
   own element, yet that doth not alter the case; they are slaves for all
   that: They that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh.'
   Rom. viii. 5. They seem to live at large, but indeed they are in a
   spiritual prison; they cannot use the means that should make them
   happy. They employ their whole time in the remote subservient helps to
   a happy life, in pleasures, and honours, and profits; as dissolute and
   carnal factors and servants, who, finding contentment at the first inn
   they come at, spend most of their time and money there, which should be
   spent at the fairs and mart for which they are bound. Plea sure, and
   delight, and contentment of mind and body, is a remote subservient
   help; so competency of wealth, and some place wherein we may glorify
   God: these things are not to be desired for themselves, nor in any
   great measure, but subordinately, in order to our great end. Now, when
   they entice and detain our affections, and we cannot look after our
   great end, they break our liberty; for the less power we have to do
   that which we should desire to do, the more slaves are we.

   [2.] That which disordereth the constitution of the soul, and puts
   reason out of dominion, that certainly is spiritual bondage and
   thraldom. Now, when the base prevail above the honourable, it is a sign
   a country is enthralled; where beggars are on horseback, and princes
   walk on foot; or, as it is monstrous in the body if the head be there
   where the feet should be, and the feet where the head should be; such a
   de-ordination is there in the soul when the affections carry it, and
   lust taketh the throne instead of reason: Titus iii. 3, Serving divers
   lusts and pleasures.' When a man yieldeth up himself to his own
   desires, he becometh a proper servant: Rom. vi. 16, Know ye not that to
   whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are whom ye
   obey, whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?'
   Now, man rightly constituted, his actions are thus governed: The
   understanding and conscience prescribe to the will; the will, according
   to right reason and conscience, moveth the affections; the affections,
   according to the command and counsel of the will, move the bodily
   spirits and members of the body. But by corruption there is a manifest
   inversion and change; pleasures affect the senses, the senses corrupt
   the phantasy, phantasy moveth the bodily spirits, they the affections;
   and by their violence the will is carried captive, man blinded, and so
   man goeth on headlong to his own destruction. The corrupt passions are
   like wild horses, that do not obey the driver, but draw to precipices
   for his destruction. Therefore Basil of Seleucia calleth a carnal man a
   slave, that runs after the chariots of his own passions and corrupt
   affections.

   [3.] Consider the great tyranny and power of sin; it leaveth us no
   right and power to dispose of ourselves and our actions, and so men
   cannot help themselves when they would; as is sensible in them that are
   convinced of better, and do worse: they see what they should do, but do
   not do it, being drawn away by their own lusts. Video meliora proboque,
   deteriora sequor. Sin hath gotten such a deep interest in their
   actions, and command over their affections, that they cannot leave what
   they know to be naught, or follow that which they conceive to be good.
   And this bondage is more sensible in them that have some kind of
   remorse and trouble with their convictions, either from temporal
   inconvenience, shame, or loss, and yet cannot leave their lusts, and so
   in despair resolve to go on, and make the best of it: Jer. xviii. 12,
   And they said, There is no hope, but we will walk after our own
   devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart;'
   Jer. ii. 25, Thou hast said, There is no hope; no, for I have loved
   strangers, and after them will I go;' yea, further, that have a kindly
   remorse from the conviction of the Spirit: Jer. xxxi. 18, I have surely
   heard Ephraim bemoaning himself, thus, Thou hast chastised me, and I
   was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke.' And so Paul:
   Rom. vii. 14, I am carnal, sold under sin.'

   [4.] Consider how this bondage is always increased by custom, which is
   a second nature, or an inveterate disease not easily cured: Jer. xiii.
   23, Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then
   may ye also do good who are accustomed to do evil.' The more he
   continueth in this course, the less able to help himself; the more he
   sinneth, the more he is enthralled to sin; as a nail, the more it is
   knocked, the more it is fastened in the wood. First a man yields up
   himself to sin as a servant by covenant: Rom. vi. 16, Know ye not to
   whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom
   ye obey?' that is, gives up his principal time, actions, and
   employment. Then a servant of conquest: 2 Peter ii. 19, While they
   promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption;
   for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.' A
   sinner is under the dominion of sin, as a hired servant and a captive.
   We first willingly, and by our own default, run into it, and after
   cannot rid ourselves of it. Ligatus eram nonferro alieno, sed mea
   ferrea voluntate; velle meum tenebat inimicus, et me mihi catenam
   fecerat, et constrinxerat me--Lord, I am bound, not with iron, but with
   an obstinate will; I gave my will to mine enemy, and he made a chain of
   it to bind me, and keep me from thee. Quippe ex voluntate perversa
   facta est libido, et dum servitur libidini facia est consuetudo, et dum
   consuetudo non resistitur facta est necessitas (Aug. Confes. lib. viii.
   cap. 5)--a perverse will gave way to lustings, and lustings made way
   for a custom, and a custom let alone brought a necessity upon me, that
   I can do nothing but sin against thee. And after that, Reformidabam
   quasi mortem consuetudinis mutationem (Aug. Confes. lib. viii. cap. 7).
   Thus are we by little and little en slaved, brought under the power of
   every toy. Things are lawful as subordinate helps; but we, contrary to
   the law of reason, and the inclination to true happiness, immoderately
   desire them; and these desires being excessive, get a complete victory
   Over our souls: and at length we are brought under the power of every
   creature: 1 Cor. vi. 12, All things are lawful, but I will not be
   brought under the power of any.'

   [5.] There is one thing more that maketh the carnal life to be a mere
   slavery; and that is, the fear and terror which doth arise from the
   consciousness of sin, the fear of death and damnation, and wrath to
   come, which doggeth sin at the heels. When Adam sinned, he was afraid,
   Gen. iii. 7; and carnal men are all their lifetime subject to bondage
   through the fear of death,' Heb. ii. 15. There is a fire smothering in
   the bosom of a sinner, and sometimes it flashes out in actual gripes
   and horrors; they have grievous damps of heart; so that sinners are so
   far bondmen, that they dare not seriously call themselves to an account
   for the expense of their time and employments, which every one should
   do, nor think seriously of death, or God's judgment, or hell. He that
   is always under the check of a cruel master cannot be said to be a
   freeman. Now so is every man that is not in Christ; let him be never so
   great, and mighty, and powerful, he is enochos douleias, subject to
   bondage,' in danger of hidden fears, easily awakened in his heart.
   Well, then, call you this a free life? As jolly and jocund as wicked
   men seem to be, or as great as they are, it is a liberty of the flesh
   taken by men, not given by God; the quietness of the flesh, but bane of
   the soul.

   2. On the contrary, the true liberty is in the ways of God.

   [1.] There we are directed how to attain to our great end, which is
   true blessedness: Mat. vii. 14, Strait is the gate and narrow is the
   way that leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.' A way of
   sin seemeth broad and easy to the flesh, but it is strait and hard to
   the spirit; and the way of duty strait and narrow to the flesh, but,
   because it is to life, it is broad to the spirit or new nature: I shall
   walk at liberty.' To a renewed heart the divine commandments are not
   grievous, 1 John v. 3, for by this means they come to enjoy God, and
   walk to their happiness, and attain to the end for which they were
   made. A poor heart goes home cheerfully.

   [2.] In loving, fearing, praising, serving God, the noblest faculties
   are exercised in the noblest and most regular way of operation. The
   soul is in the right temper and constitution; they are the highest
   actions of the highest faculties, elevated by the highest principles,
   about the highest objects. The objects are God, Christ, heaven, the
   great things of eternity. The principles are the love and fear of God,
   the faculties, understanding, and will, not sensitive appetite; these
   exercised in thinking of God, and choosing of God.

   Secondly, The second part of the demonstration is that there is liberty
   given to walk in that way. Ever since Adam's fall every man is a
   spiritual slave, under the dominion and power of sin and Satan, and the
   curse of the law; but now, Where the Spirit of the Lord is there is
   liberty,' 2 Cor. iii. 17; true Christian liberty, or a power given us
   to walk familiarly with God, and cheerfully and comfortably in his
   service. By grace a man is freed--

   1. From the yoke of oppressing fears.

   2. The tyranny of commanding lusts.

   1. We are freed from the bondage of sin: Rom. viii. 2, The law of the
   spirit of life, which is in Christ Jesus, hath made us free from the
   law of sin and death;' John viii. 36, If the Son therefore shall make
   you free, ye shall be free indeed.' There is a liberty in that which is
   good: Ps. cxix. 32, I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou
   shalt enlarge my heart.'

   2. We are freed from those doubts and fears and terrors which
   accompanied the state of sin: Job xxxvi. 8, If they be bound in
   fetters, and be holden in the cords of affliction;' Job xiii. 27, Thou
   puttest my feet also in the stocks;' Lam. iii. 7, He hath hedged me
   about, that I cannot get out; he hath made my chain heavy.' So that the
   meaning is, I shall walk at liberty, be cheerful and enlarged in heart;
   for I seek thy precepts.

   Thirdly, There is liberty in that walking: it is the fruit of
   strictness. There is a twofold liberty:--

   1. Outward deliverances out of straits and afflictions: Ps. cxviii. 5,
   I called upon the Lord in distress; the Lord answered me, and set me in
   a large place;' and Ps. xviii. 19, He brought me forth also into a
   large place; he delivered me because he delighted in me.' So Ps. iv. 1,
   Thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress.' Affliction is compared
   to a prison, where the poor afflicted creature is as it were confined,
   committed by God, and must not break prison, come out by the window,
   but the door. When we are let put by God upon submission and
   supplication, urging the satisfaction of Christ, as we are sent thither
   by God's authority, so we come out by God's love. Now, God doth this
   for those that obey him, as all those places manifest.

   2. Inward confidence. Ennomos zoe` tes parresi'as demiourgos, saith
   Chrysostom on the text--A holy life is the ground of liberty, and holy
   boldness: 1 John iii. 21, If our hearts condemn us not, then have we
   liberty towards God;' we have delight, and pleasure, and contentment.
   Till we defile conscience, we have a great deal of boldness and courage
   against opposition, yea, a boldness to go to God himself, who otherwise
   is a consuming fire.

   Use 1. Is to take off that prejudice that we have against the ways of
   God, as if they were strait and hard, and not to be endured. Oh, no!
   all God's ways are for our good: Deut. vi. 24, The Lord commanded us to
   do all these statutes,' to fear the Lord our God for our good always.
   And the duties that he requireth of us are honourable and comfortable;
   we never walk more at large than when we have a conscience of them. Man
   acteth like himself when he is holy, just, temperate, sober, humble.
   Grace puts all things in the right frame and posture again: it puts
   reason in dominion, and maketh us kings in governing our own hearts;
   and this breedeth sweetness and peace. Pax est tranquillitas
   ordinis--when all things keep their place, then is there peace. As when
   the humours of the body are in order, and the spirits move tuneably,
   there is a cheerfulness ensueth; so the fruit of righteousness is peace
   and joy in the Holy Ghost. If a man had no rule to guide him, and God
   had left him without a law, yet, if he were well in his wits, he would
   prefer the duties which he hath enjoined before liberty, and of his own
   accord choose to live according to such an institution; there is such a
   suitableness in all those things to the reasonable nature. What do men
   aim at--pleasure, honour, or profit? For pleasure: Prov. iii. 17, Her
   ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.' None have
   such a sweet life as they that live virtuously and as God hath
   commanded. All the sensualists in the world have not such a dainty dish
   to feed on as they that have a good conscience: they have a continual
   feast, that never cloyeth. You never come away from your sports with
   such a merry heart as they come away from the throne of grace. If men
   would consider their experiences after the discharge of their duties
   and when straggling to carnal delights; after saddest duties, there is
   a serenity in the conscience. Who ever repented of his repentance? 1
   Sam. i. 18, Hannah went her way, and did eat, and her spirit was no
   more sad.' Prayer giveth ease, but sensual pleasures leave remorse and
   a sting. If you count liberty to consist in hunting after honours and
   great places, can there be a greater honour than to serve God? Who hath
   the better service, he that attendeth on the uncertain will of men,
   yea, of the greatest princes, or he that waiteth on the Lord? Your work
   is more noble: Prov. xii. 26, The righteous is more excellent than his
   neighbour.' What an unprofitable drudgery is the service of the
   greatest prince in the world, in comparison of the work of a poor
   Christian, that liveth in communion with God? We serve a greater
   prince, and on surer terms. Then for profit: Where is there more gain,
   as to our vails and wages, than in God's service? Well, then, he that
   liveth holily hath much the sweeter and happier life than they that
   serve covetousness, ambition, or any other lust. Certainly this should
   persuade us to put our neck under Christ's yoke; it is zu'gos
   chresto`s--Mat. 11. 29, His yoke is easy, and his burden is light.' If
   it be grievous, it is to the flesh, and we have no reason to indulge
   the flesh: Rom. viii. 7, The carnal mind is enmity against God; for it
   is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.' The command
   to an unsound conscience is as a light burden laid on a sore back. Men
   that are soaked in pleasures are incompetent judges of the sweetness of
   the heavenly life. On the other side, what a miserable servitude is
   there in sin! how disabled for their great end for which they were
   created! Corruption is an imperious master; it will not suffer us to
   hear good things, to be there where good things are spoken, to
   accompany them that are good; it hath them in so strait a custody, they
   hate the means of their recovery. They have many masters. Quot habet
   dominos qui unum habere non vult! Titus iii. 3, For we ourselves were
   sometimes foolish, disobedient, serving divers lusts and pleasures;'
   and James iv. i, Whence come wars and fightings among you? Come they
   not hence, even of your lusts, that war in your members?' One lust
   draweth one way, another another way; covetousness, voluptuousness,
   ambition, uncleanness; as when two seas meet. We have little reason to
   envy them for their free life; pity them rather. How do their brutish
   affections hurry them! What pains, aches in the body, wounds in the
   conscience! How many secret gripes and scourges! No such subjection, no
   slave so subject to the will of his lord, as a man to his lusts and
   sinful desires,--will speak, think nothing but what sin commands. It is
   a besotting slavery. Wicked men remain in this bondage with a kind of
   pleasure. Galley-slaves would fain be free, wish for liberty. Israel
   was in bondage in Egypt, but they groaned under it: The cry of the
   children of Israel is come up to me.' Here men loathe to come out of
   their slavery, and are enemies to those that would help them out. Their
   work is hard and oppressive, loss of name, health, estate. They tire
   their spirits, rack their brains, and after all their drudging are cast
   into hell.

   Use 2. Do we walk at liberty?

   1. There was a time when we served sin; but being converted, we change
   masters: Rom. vi. 18, Being made free from sin, ye became the servants
   of righteousness.' If there be such a change, it will discover itself.
   (1.) You will do as little service for sin as formerly for
   righteousness: Rom. vi. 20, When ye were the servants of sin, ye were
   free from righteousness;' righteousness had no share in your time,
   thoughts, cares; you made no conscience of doing good, took no care of
   it: so now you do as little for sin. (2.) Positively do as much for
   grace as formerly for sin: ver. 19, As you yielded your members
   servants unto uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity, so now yield
   your members servants unto righteousness unto holiness;' as watchful,
   as earnest, as industrious to perfect holiness, as formerly to commit
   sin: it is but equal. He that hath been servant unto a hard and cruel
   master is thereby fitted to be diligent and faithful in the service of
   a loving, gentle, and bountiful master. You can judge what a tyrant sin
   was. Shall not grace have as much power over you now, and will you not
   do as much for God as for your lusts?

   2. What do you complain of as the task and yoke--the strictness of the
   law, or the relics of corruption? Rom. viii. 7, The carnal mind is
   enmity against God, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither
   indeed can be;' compared with 1 John v. 3, This is the love of God,
   that we keep his commandments, and his commandments are not grievous.'
   What is a bondage--sin or duty? Is the commandment grievous, or
   indwelling sin? The apostle was complaining, but of what? The purity of
   the law? No; but the power of indwelling corruption, the body of death:
   Rom. vii. 24, O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from this
   body of death?' Which do your hearts rise against?

   3. What freedom? Luke i. 74, 75, That you, being delivered out of the
   hands of your enemies, might serve him without fear, in holiness and
   righteousness before him all the days of your lives.' If you are
   enslaved to any one lust, you cannot walk at large. Are your gyves and
   fetters knocked off? Have you that free spirit? Ps. li. 11, 12, Cast me
   not away from thy presence, take not thy Holy Spirit from me; restore
   unto me the joy of thy salvation, and uphold me by thy free spirit.'
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON LII.

   I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be
   ashamed.--Ver. 46.

   THE man of God had prayed, ver. 43, that God would not take the word of
   truth utterly out of his mouth;' that is, deny him the liberty or the
   grace, the opportunity or the heart, to make an open profession of his
   faith and respect to God and his ways. This suit he backeth with sundry
   arguments.

   1. From his hope: ver. 23, For I have hoped in thy judgments.' He had
   placed all his confidence in them, and therefore would openly profess
   what rule he lived by, and what expectations he had from

   2. His resolution to persist in this course, whatever befell him: ver.
   44, So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever;' it would
   engage him to constancy to the end of his life.

   3. From the alacrity and readiness of his obedience, as well as the
   constancy: ver. 45, And I will walk at liberty, for I seek thy
   precepts.' Then we have true liberty.

   4. That no worldly splendour or terror should take him off from making
   this confession, if God would give him liberty and opportunity. Two
   things hinder a free confession of God's truth carnal fear and carnal
   shame. Both are obviated by the resolution of the man of God; he would
   neither be afraid nor ashamed to recommend the ways of God to the
   greatest princes of the world.

   [1.] The terror of kings or men in power may be supposed to be a
   hindrance to the free confession of God's truth; therefore he saith, I
   will speak of thy testimonies also before kings.'

   [2.] Carnal shame may breed a loathness to own God's despised ways;
   therefore he addeth, I will not be ashamed.' David would neither be
   afraid nor ashamed, if called thereto, to make this open confession, to
   own God and his truth.

   First, His resolution against fear deserveth a little opening: I will
   speak of thy testimonies also before kings.' The words may be looked
   upon as a direction for them who are called to speak before kings. Men
   may suppose to be called--

   1. Either by the duty of their office, to speak to them in a way of
   instruction; or

   2. As convened before them in a judiciary way, to give an account of
   their faith.

   1. In the first sense, those who are called to instruct kings ought
   with the greatest confidence to recommend the ways of God to them, as
   that which will enhance their crowns and dignity, and make it more
   glorious and comfortable to them and their subjects than anything else.
   And so David's resolution showeth what faithfulness becometh them who
   live in the courts of princes. It concerneth princes to be instructed:
   Ps. ii. 10, Be wise now therefore, ye kings; be instructed, ye judges
   of the earth.' Few speak plainly and sincerely to them, as Nathan to
   David: 2 Sam. xii. 7, Thou art the man;' and God to David: 2 Sam. xxiv.
   13, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land; or wilt
   thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or
   that there be three days' pestilence in the land?' John the Baptist to
   Herod: Mat. xiv. 4, It is not lawful for thee to have her,' Jehu to
   Jehoshaphat: 2 Chron. xix. 2, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love
   them that hate the Lord? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the
   Lord.' Many times they are impatient of truth, as Ahab could not endure
   Micaiah: 1 Kings xxii. 8, And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat,
   There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may inquire
   of the Lord; but I hate him, for he doth not prophesy good concerning
   me, but evil,' &c. (Josephus, lib. viii. cap. 10; Theodoret, lib. iv.
   cap. 30).

   2. If convened before them in a judiciary way, as the three children
   were before Nebuchadnezzar: Dan. iii. 13, Then Nebuchadnezzar in his
   rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and
   they brought these men before the king;' and ver. 16-18, They answered
   and said to the king, Nebuchadnezzar! we are not careful to answer thee
   in this matter; if it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver
   us out of thine hand, O king; but if not, be it known unto thee, O
   king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image
   which thou hast set up;' Mat. x. 18, 19, Ye shall be brought before
   governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.' There
   are some kings that have not submitted their crowns and sceptres to the
   King of kings; so pagans and wicked princes who can neither endure the
   truth, nor those which profess it. Hoi kalli'nikoi ma'rtures ton
   dussebon katephro'nesen basile'on. The children of God ought not to be
   daunted by any power and fear of princes. Their power may be a terror
   to us, and in other cases ought to be reverenced by us; but it should
   not be a snare to us, to make us desert our duty to God. We must never
   forget the honour put upon them by God: they bear his image, and in all
   lawful cases we acknowledge God's authority in them; they are those by
   whom God will govern us; but if anything be decreed against God, we
   only urge our obedience to the Lord paramount: Acts iv. 19, Peter and
   John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of
   God to hearken unto you more than God, judge ye;' Acts v. 29, Then
   Peter and the apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather
   than men.'

   The latter branch needeth little explaining. What shall we ob serve?

   1. If I should take the first reference, and urge the duty of kings and
   princes, that would be unseasonable for this auditory. It is a
   preposterous solecism to preach to the people the duty of kings, and
   then to kings the duty of their people; as foolish a course as to make
   fires in summer, and adorn the chimney with herbs and flowers in
   winter.

   2. If I should speak of the second reference, the clemency of the
   government we live under maketh it unseasonable also; for our king
   (whom God preserve) hath often avowed his resolutions against
   persecutions for conscience' sake. Therefore, waiving all other things,
   I shall only insist upon two points, which are necessary, partly to
   show the excellency of our religion which we profess, partly to guide
   our practice.

   Doct. 1. That nothing is so necessary for kings, princes, and
   magistrates to know as God's testimonies.

   Doct. 2. That God's testimonies are so excellent, that we should not be
   afraid or ashamed to own them before any sort of men in the world.

   Of the first briefly.

   Doct. 1. That nothing is so necessary for the potentates of the world
   to know as God's testimonies. The king of Israel was to write a copy of
   the law of God in a book, and to have it ever before him, that he might
   read therein, and learn to fear the Lord his God, Deut. xvii. 18, 19.
   And therefore Josiah, one of the good kings which God gave unto his
   people, searched for the book of the law, 2 Kings xxiii. 2. The reasons
   concern them, if considered both as men and as potentates.

   1. As men.

   [1.] They are upon the same level with others, and are concerned to
   understand the way of pleasing, glorifying, and enjoying God, as much
   as their meanest subjects; for it is said, Job xxxiv. 19, He accepteth
   not the person of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor;
   for they are all the works of his hands.' God dealeth with them
   impartially, respecting the greatest no more than the meanest. He hath
   an equal interest in all, and therefore doth command and dispose of
   all; for all are his creatures, not exempted from being subject to his
   dominion; as the potter is not more obliged to vessels of honour, than
   of dishonour. As his law bindeth all, so all that continue in
   impenitency and the neglect of his grace are obnoxious to the curse of
   the law. It is general to all transgressors: Cursed is every one,' &c.
   And if God should lay their sins home to their consciences, and speak
   to them in his wrath, they can stand before him no more than the
   meanest: Rev. vi. 15, 16, And the kings of the earth, and the great
   men, and the rich men, and chief captains, and the mighty men, and
   every bondman, and every freeman, hid themselves in the dens, and in
   the rocks of the mountains, and said to the mountains and rocks, Fall
   on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and
   from the wrath of the Lamb.'

   [2.] The higher their station the greater their obligation. No sort of
   men more obliged to God than those that are advanced by him to rule
   over his people; therefore their ingratitude would be greater if they
   should sin against God: 2 Sam. xii. 7-9, I anointed thee king over
   Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hands of Saul, and I gave thee
   thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave
   thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little,
   I would moreover have given thee such and such things. Wherefore hast
   thou despised the commandment of the Lord, to do evil in his sight?'
   Their sins do more hurt, because of their example and authority, Job
   xxxiv. 20.

   2. As rulers and potentates they are concerned to be acquainted with
   God's testimonies.

   [1.] That they may understand their place and duty. They are first
   God's subjects, then his officers. They have their power from God:
   Horn. xiii. 4, For he is the minister of God to thee for good.' They
   hold their power in dependence on him; both natural, their strength and
   force: Thou couldest have no power unless it were given thee from
   above,' John xix. 10, 11. Legal, their authority or governing power,
   they hold it in dependence upon the absolute and heavenly Sovereign,
   who is the Lord of lords and King of kings:' Prov. viii. 15, 16, By me
   kings reign, and princes decree justice; by me princes rule, and
   nobles, and all the judges of the earth.' And as they hold it in
   dependence on him, they must use it in subordination to him. God, who
   is the beginning, must also be the end of their government. They are
   not officers of men, but ministers of God, from whom they have their
   authority; and therefore must rule for God, and seek his glory.

   [2.] That they may be carried through their cares, and fears, and
   snares, and may know what reward to expect from the absolute Sovereign,
   who is the great patron of human societies. It is trust and dependence
   upon God that maketh good magistrates: 2 Kings xviii. 5, He trusted in
   the Lord God of Israel, so that after him there was none like him among
   all the kings of Judah, nor any that went before him.' Oh! it is a
   blessed thing when they can go to God for direction, and depend upon
   God for success. Great are the cares and fears which belong to a
   governor; and who can ease him of this burden but the Lord, who hath
   showed in his word how far he is to be trusted? It is not carnal policy
   which helpeth them out in their work, but trust in God in their high
   calling. Whosoever will improve his power for God will meet with many
   discouragements. Now that which sup ports his heart in his work is this
   holy trust: Prov. xxix. 25, The fear of man bringeth a snare; but whoso
   putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe.' Every public calling hath
   its snares and temptations from the fears of men. A minister, if he
   doth not trust God to bear him out in his work, he will do nothing with
   that courage which becometh a minister, but comply with the lusts of
   men, grow lukewarm, prostitute the ordinances for handfuls of barley,
   and pieces of bread, and family conveniences. The magistracy is a
   higher calling, which is more obnoxious to temptations from the
   different humours of men, who are to be governed. Nothing will carry a
   man through it but this holy courage and dependence on God. The fear of
   man brought a snare to Jeroboam, that he perverted the worship of God:
   1 Kings xii. 30, And this thing became a sin; for the people went to
   worship before the one, even unto Dan.' So Jehu, so others, for their
   cares. But he that trusts in God in his discharge of this public
   office, though, many difficulties interpose, finds the blessed
   experience of the Psalmist verified, In the multitude of my thoughts
   within me, thy comforts delight my soul.'

   [3.] As to success and acceptance, obedience to God makes them a,
   double blessing to the people--as governors, as holy; as they have the
   natural image of God in dominion and authority: 1 Cor. xi. 7, Forasmuch
   as he is the image and glory of God,' which must be reverenced and
   respected, not resisted; so the spiritual image of God in holiness: the
   people doubly see God in their rulers. And besides, it bringeth down
   God's blessings, while they command and the people obey in the Lord: 2
   Kings xviii. 7, And the Lord was with him, and he prospered
   whithersoever he went forth.' Good magistrates are usually more
   prosperous than good men in a private condition, because they are given
   as a public blessing.

   Use 1. To inform us that religion hath a great influence on the welfare
   of human societies; for it equally respects governors an# governed,
   carving out their respective duties to them, causing the one to rule
   well, and the other to obey for conscience' sake. The testimonies of
   the Lord prescribe the duty of rulers: 2 Sam. xxiii. 3, He that ruleth
   over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.' There is a word
   belonging to either table; justice to the second, fear of God to the
   first. Now all this duty is best learned out of God's testimonies. For
   the governed it interposeth express rules for their obedience: Rom.
   xiii. 1, Let every soul be subject to the higher powers;' and 1 Peter
   ii. 15, For so is the will of God, that with well-doing ye may put to
   silence the ignorance of foolish men.' There are many arguments why we
   should reverence magistrates. They bear God's image: Ps. lxxxii. 6, I
   have said ye are gods;' visible representators of his authority and
   dominion over the creatures, because of their majesty, largeness of
   command and empire, and because of their use: they are exalted supra
   alios, above others in their authority; but propter altos, for others
   in their use and benefit. But the supreme reason is the will of God.
   The magistrate was then an enemy to religion when this commandment was
   given forth, even then when that part of the world in which the church
   was seated was under the command of Nero, whose universal wickedness
   and particular cruelty against the Christians might tempt them to
   disobedience and scorn of his authority: then God said, Obey not for
   fear of wrath, but conscience 3 sake;' then, Fear God, honour the king,
   for so is the will of God.' Now let atheists and anti-scripturists, or
   the enemies of those who profess to live by scripture, think, if they
   can, that the Christian religion doth not befriend human societies, or
   doth contain dangerous principles to government.

   Use 2. It showeth us what to pray for, for our princes and governors,
   even a wise and an understanding heart, and a spirit of the fear of the
   Lord, that they may rule for God, and take his blessing along with them
   in all their affairs.

   Doct. 2. That God's testimonies are so excellent that we should not be
   afraid or ashamed to own them before any sort of men in the world; for
   David saith, I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and
   will not be ashamed.'

   First, Observe, here are two things supposed which might shut his mouth
   and obstruct the confidence and boldness of his profession fear and
   shame. Fear represents danger in owning the ways of God; shame
   represents mockage, scorn, and contempt. Fear considereth our superiors
   and governors; we fear them that have power and authority in their
   hands. Shame may arise not only from the consideration of superiors,
   but inferiors and equals also. Fear respects the danger of the party
   professing; shame, the cause or matter professed. Therefore, of the
   two, to be ashamed of the ways of God doth more destroy godliness than
   to be afraid to own them, for then it is a sign we are not so soundly
   convinced, and deeply possessed of the goodness of them; for, Pudor est
   conscientia turpitudinis--it is a consciousness of something that is
   base. Look, as, on the contrary, to be ashamed of sin doth more wound
   it to the heart than to be afraid of sin, many a man is apprehensive of
   the danger of sin, who yet doth not hate it in his heart, but only
   abstaineth out of the fear of punishment; but when be is ashamed of
   sin, then he beginneth to hate sin as sin. In conversion, fear is
   stirring before shame; as a man sick of a loathsome painful disease is
   more and first affected with the pain than with the nastiness and
   filthiness and putrefaction that accompanieth the disease. So here, in
   religion; as the case is hopeful when ashamed of sin, so dangerous when
   ashamed of a strict holy course. A man may be willing to do that which
   he dares not do for fear; but shame extinguisheth the willingness
   itself. In short, to be afraid respects our interest; to be ashamed
   respects the cause, the gospel itself.

   Secondly, I shall speak of them distinctly; and so--

   1. Show why we should not be afraid to own the testimonies and ways of
   God before any sort of people in the world.

   [1.] Because holy boldness in confession is an especial gift of God.
   David asketh it here, Take not the word of truth utterly out of my
   mouth;' and promiseth that if God would give him this gift, the
   splendour of worldly greatness should not dazzle his eyes, and he would
   behave himself as one armed against all terrors of men, or gotten above
   the hopes and fears of the present world. And indeed it argueth some
   good degree of profiting in the word of God when it is so with us.
   Fearlessness of men in God's cause is an excellent grace, which God
   hath promised to his choice servants. To Christ: Isa. 1. 7, For the
   Lord God will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded; therefore
   have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be
   ashamed; I shall not be confounded, for God is at my right hand.' To
   Jeremiah, whom God set up as a brazen wall against all oppositions:
   Jer. i. 18; and to Ezekiel, chap. iii. 8, Behold, I have made thy face
   strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their
   foreheads.' So to the disciples: Mat. x. 19, 20, They shall bring you
   before rulers and governors; but take no thought how or what ye shall
   speak, for it shall be given you in the same hour what ye shall speak.'
   None have the gift of boldness but those to whom God gives it. If left
   to ourselves, we shall falter, as Peter did at the damsel's question;
   but God will assist the resolved heart by his Spirit, and assist him in
   that very hour when the trial cometh; and then we need not be afraid
   before whomsoever we come, we need not be anxious. The servants of God
   beg this gift: Acts iv. 29, Grant unto thy servants that with all
   boldness we may speak thy word;' when the world rageth against them.

   [2.] Though it be an especial gift of God, yet the duty is contained in
   our first dedication and resignation of ourselves to Christ; when we
   professed ourselves to be dead to every worldly interest, and promised
   to own him and his ways, whatever it cost us: Luke xiv. 26, If any man
   come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and
   children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he
   cannot be my disciple;' ver. 33, So likewise, whosoever he be of you
   that forsaketh not all he hath, he cannot be my disciple.' Therefore
   this should not be retracted, but verified in our whole course, for
   that showeth this dedication was sound: Heb. iii. 6, Whose house are
   we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm
   unto the end; ver. 14, For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold
   the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end.' And therefore
   we should be ready to render a reason of the hope which is in us, to
   every one that asketh us, with meekness and fear,' 1 Peter iii. 15.
   Logon elpidos is an account of our religion, hetoimoi, ready to confess
   Christ in persecutions and dangers: it is the same with hetoimos
   echo--Acts xxi. 13, I am ready not only to be bound, but to die at
   Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord Jesus;' the same with hetoimasia
   tes eirenes tou euangeliou, the preparation of the gospel of peace,'
   Eph. vi. 15; a prepared resolved heart to encounter all difficulties
   for the gospel's sake, so satisfied with the truth and hopes thereof.

   [3.] This duty is confirmed in us by many Christian graces, as faith,
   love to God, fear of God, a deep sense of the world to come. We are
   afraid to own God and his ways, because we have not such a high opinion
   of God as we should have, but too great a love to ourselves; therefore
   faith, fear, and love is necessary to confirm and strengthen this
   resolution in us, and also the lively hope of blessedness to come.

   (1.) Faith informeth us of the truth, goodness, power, and excellency
   of God, the worth of his favour, and the terror of his wrath, that the
   displeasure of God is much worse than the frowns of men. When we think
   of a higher Lord, why should we be afraid of a man that shall die, and
   the son of man that is as grass? If a great man stand by, we are not
   afraid of an underling. If the King of kings be with us, whom should we
   fear? Heb. xi. 27, By faith Moses feared not the wrath of the king,'
   meaning Pharaoh. Why? For he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.'
   A heathen could say, Regum timendorum in proprios greges, reges in
   ipsos imperium est Jovis. A believer should much more oppose God's
   heavenly majesty to their earthly dignity. Their power is great, and to
   be reverenced next to God; but God is greater. We serve a king whose
   power is everlasting, and whose kingdom is to all generations.

   (2.) Love to God is necessary to confirm and strengthen this resolution
   in us, for that overcometh all terrors: Rom. viii. 37, Nay, in all
   these things we are more than conquerors, through him that loved us;'
   and Cant. viii. 6, 7, Love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the
   grave; the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement
   flame; many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it:
   if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would
   utterly be contemned.' There is an unconquerable force in love; it is a
   fire that cannot be quenched. When Christ hath us by the heart, it is
   much more than when he hath us by the head. They that make a religion
   of their opinions, and have a faith that never went deeper than their
   brains and fancies, are soon discouraged; but when Christ dwelleth in
   the heart by faith,' Eph. iii. 17, there he resideth as in his strong
   citadel and castle. A Christian, because he loveth Christ, will own
   him, and his ways and truth, though they be never so much, despised in
   the world. A superficial bare assent to the gospel may let Christ go,
   but a faith working by love will not.

   (3.) The fear of God, or a deep awe and reverence of him, when we are
   more afraid to offend God than to suffer from man. The apostle, when he
   biddeth us to be ready to make profession, 1 Peter iii. 5, bids us do
   it with meekness and fear.' Meekness respects men; fear, a care to
   approve ourselves to God. The fear of men is checked by the fear of
   God: Isa. viii. 12, 13, Neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid:
   sanctify the Lord of hosts himself, and let him be your fear, and let
   him be your dread;' Luke xii. 4, 5, Be not afraid of them that kill the
   body, and after that have no more that they can do: but I will forewarn
   you whom you shall fear; fear him which, after he hath killed, hath
   power to cast into hell.' A holy impression of God's excellency and
   greatness left upon the heart is this fear that carrieth the cause
   clearly for God; and as one nail driveth out another, the fear of men
   banisheth the fear of God out of our hearts. We are obliged to none so
   as to God, who hath the power of eternal life and eternal death. What
   is a prison to hell, a little vainglory to eternal glory, the creature
   to God?

   (4.) A deep sense of the other world. When we translate the scene from
   earth to heaven, from this world to the next, and consider who is
   scorned there, received there, or rejected there, the temptation is
   lessened. The apostle showeth that a spirit of faith is at the bottom
   of confession with the mouth: 2 Cor. iv. 13, We, having the same spirit
   of faith, believe, and therefore speak.' He that believeth another
   world, and hopeth for it, will never be cowardly and bashful, but will
   confidently confess Christ, and own him both in worship and
   conversation. A spirit of faith cannot be suppressed, but will break
   out and show itself, and not be ashamed of Christ, his truth and ways.

   Well, then, Christians should be ashamed of that spirit of fear,
   bashfulness, and inconfidence which keeps us from confessing Christ and
   owning his ways. Kings are more formidable by their place and power
   than the rest of the world; but alas! we give place to the meanest men,
   and the smallest opposition maketh us give out: 2 Tim. i. 7, We have
   not the spirit of fear, but the spirit of love, power, and a sound
   mind.' The Christian spirit is a sober spirit, that valueth all things
   according to their weight; but not a dastardly spirit: a spirit of love
   and power, that owneth Christ with meekness, and a due respect to
   earthly tribunals; and yet with courage, as looking higher, to the
   throne of God.

   2. We must not be ashamed to own the testimonies and ways of God before
   any sort of men in the world. The apostle telleth us, Horn. i. 16, I am
   not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ.' The gospel is such a pure,
   sure rule, and offereth us such glorious hopes, that we should be ready
   to profess it without being ashamed of it. So he bids Timothy, 2 Tim.
   i. 8, Be not ashamed of the testimony of the Lord, nor of me his
   prisoner;' neither of the profession, nor of our companions in the
   profession, when they are under the greatest disgrace. So again, 1
   Peter iv. 16, If any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed,
   but glorify God in this behalf;' it is matter of thanksgiving, not of
   shame. David is an instance; when Michal scoffed at him, I will yet be
   more vile,' 2 Sam. vi. 22. It is an honour to be dishonoured for
   Christ. The primitive Christians, when the heathens reproached them,
   Art thou not ashamed to believe ^in him that was crucified? the answer
   was, I am ashamed to believe in him that committed adultery, meaning
   the heathen Jupiter. Affliction is no disgrace, but sin is.

   But what danger is there of being ashamed of the gospel, since
   Christianity is in fashion?

   Ans. 1. Sometimes the simplicity of the gospel is contemned by the wits
   of the world; and therefore they either muster up the oppositions of
   science falsely so called, or else droll upon religion, and make it the
   common jest and byword.

   Ans. 2. The stricter profession of the ways of God is under reproach.
   Though the nominal Christian and the serious Christian have the same
   Bible, and believe the same creed, and are baptized into one and the
   same profession, yet those that are false to their religion will hate
   and scorn those that are true to it; and among the carnal it will be
   matter of reproach to be serious and diligent. Now, though a gracious
   heart can be vile for God, yet others are afraid they shall be marked,
   and accounted precise, or Puritans; and so by resisting an imaginary
   shame, they fall into an eternal reproach.

   Ans. 3. It may be the strict sort of Christians are the poorer sort;
   and though they be precious in the eyes of God, yet they are despised
   by men: John vii. 49, This people that knoweth not the law are
   accursed. Have any of the Pharisees believed in him?' any people of
   quality? They shall be accounted people of no port and breeding if they
   are strictly Christian. Quantus in Christiana populo honor Christi est,
   ubi religio ignobilem facit? coguntur esse viles ne mali videantur.
   Religion is too mean a thing for persons of quality, of their rank.
   Thus with many God's image is made a scorn, and the devil's image had
   in honour, and serious godliness is made a byword.

   Now, to fortify you against being ashamed of God and his ways, take
   these considerations:--

   1. The short continuance of this world's glory. Within a while we shall
   be levelled with the lowest, and our dust mixed with common earth; and
   shall we love the praise of men more than the praise of God? This
   corruptible flesh must turn into a loathsome rottenness, though now it
   looketh high, and sets forth itself, and would be brave and lordly; but
   the spirit must return to God that gave it,' to be commanded into
   unseen and unknown regions: 1 Peter i. 24, All flesh is grass, and the
   glory of man as the flower of grass.'

   2. God is the fountain of honour; all things and persons receive an
   honour by having relation to him: James ii. 1, Have not the faith of
   our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, in respect of persons.'
   Services mean in themselves are accounted honourable with respect to
   princes. The reproach of Christ is enough to weigh down all the honours
   in the world: Heb. xi. 26, Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater
   riches than the treasures of Egypt.'

   3. If your hearts be sincere with God, you will not be ashamed of his
   ways, for wisdom is justified of her children;' in Luke it is, All her
   children,' Luke vii. 35. They that have a faith which is the fruit of
   conviction only may be ashamed: John xii. 42, 43, Among the rulers also
   many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess
   him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue; for they loved the
   praise of men more than the praise of God.' But that faith which is the
   fruit of conversion will make us courageous in God's cause. In its
   infancy there may be some relics of fear in a Christian, as Nicodemus
   at first came to Jesus by night, John xix. 39; but a grown faith counts
   it no loss of honour or impeachment of dignity to become vile for God.

   4. The eternal recompense: 1 Sam. ii. 30, Those that honour me I will
   honour;' 1 Peter i. 7, That your faith may be found to praise, glory,
   and honour, at Christ's coming.' On the other side, if we are ashamed
   of Christ, Christ will be ashamed of us for evermore: Mark viii. 38,
   Whosoever, therefore, shall be ashamed of me and my words in this
   adulterous and sinful generation, of him also shall the Son of man be
   ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father, with the holy
   angels.' The eagle eye of faith can look through all the pageantry of
   the world, and the mists and clouds of tune, to the future state, the
   judgment that shall be made of things. To a believer's eye all the
   honour of the world is but a fancy and vain appearance, a scene in
   which a base fellow acteth the part of a prince.

   5. The judgment of the world is not to be stood upon. Why should we
   desire the applause of the blind ungodly world, or make any great
   matter of their contempt and scorn? Shall the scorn of a fool be more
   to us than the approbation of God? If they slight you who slight God
   and Christ and their own salvation, why should you be troubled? They
   are incompetent judges of these things: 1 John iii. 1, The world
   knoweth us not.

   Use. See the strange perversion of human nature. Men are ashamed where
   they should be bold, and bold and confident where they should be
   ashamed: They glory in their shame;' but think it a disgrace to speak
   of God, and own God, not before kings only, but before their familiars
   and companions. Be ashamed to be filthy, false, proud; but never be
   ashamed to go to a sermon, where you may profit in the ways of God, and
   the knowledge of his testimonies; to be strict in conversation, to
   speak reverently of God, though scorned by men. None of God's servants
   have reason to be ashamed of their master.
